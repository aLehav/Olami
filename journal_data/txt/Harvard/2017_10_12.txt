After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Monday, Harvard students enjoyed a day off a school courtesy of Columbus Day—a day historically fraught with controversy given Christopher Columbus’s dark history of crimes against indigenous people. In this light, Harvard’s choice to quietly add Indigenous People’s Day alongside Columbus Day to the calendar is a good one.
We find it almost unnecessary to reiterate that we do not support glorifying a man who  abused and slaughtered thousands. The precedent set by his actions is at least partially responsible for European colonization in the Americas, which caused the genocide of millions of people. To celebrate Columbus blindly is to ignore an overwhelming history of colonialism, genocide, and racism.
While we support Harvard’s decision to add Indigenous People’s Day alongside Columbus Day in its official calendar, this move also appears half-hearted and calculated to avoid controversy and potential bad press. Forcing indigenous people to share a University holiday with the man who symbolizes their abuse is cruel and inappropriate.
We urge Harvard to fully replace Columbus Day instead of remaining content with acknowledging both holidays side-by-side. We see little reason to keep Columbus Day in the calendar when Indigenous People’s Day is a clear alternative. Furthermore, there are other ways to acknowledge the long history of suffering caused by Columbus, such as helping to educate students and others about the legacy of Columbus.
In light of this historical legacy of suffering inflicted upon Native Americans, we commend the years of activism by Native American students on this issue. We must never forget that the College is built on native land and was first established partially with the goal of educating indigenous youth. Recognizing Indigenous People’s Day is a small step toward honoring this legacy.
Cambridge City Council has taken the right step to formally recognize Indigenous People’s Day as a holiday and fully replace the celebration of Columbus Day last year. As support for this holiday increases, we hope that, while the wrongs of history can never be fully mended, they will at least receive the attention they deserve. Acknowledging Columbus’ true legacy strips away a comfortable narrative, but we as a nation cannot build our history—or our holidays—on such a shoddy foundation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, we are told to change the world. We came here because our hopes and aspirations are high, and this place was promised to be the ladder that would enable us to reach those goals.
Once we began to navigate this school, however, we realized that the opportunities to realize our ambitions were limited. Everyone here knows that the opportunities that you have access to depend on where you are from and what resources you had access to before you arrived.
This inequity is perhaps most starkly on display when it comes to summer opportunities in public service and public interest. Public service is an avenue by which we immerse ourselves in a community, not only to change it for the better, but to understand it as well. Such pursuits align well with the broader Harvard experience, but financial concerns prevent some students from engaging with them.
A student’s socioeconomic background should not be a barrier to the opportunities they obtain; however, often the skills required to navigate current opportunities depend heavily on a student’s prior experiences. An immediate way to level the playing field for all students in the realm of public service is to restructure the format through which students pursue summer service internships—to make the application process more streamlined, centralized, and financially feasible.
Right now, Harvard’s options for funding summer public service are scattered across various different parts of the University, making the application process confusing and difficult. The Phillips Brooks House Association and the Institute of Politics fund many internships, but each organization has multiple different funding mechanisms, each with separate timelines and requirements.
Finding an internship that matches one’s passion is difficult enough, but for many students it’s only the first barrier to a fulfilling and educational summer experience. Pursuing a low-paying or unpaid public service internship presents serious financial challenges. In cities like Washington and New York, where many of these opportunities are located, the costs of living and rent can be enormous. While some students might have families that can support their living expenses if they take such jobs, many do not. Instead, students are often forced to take paid jobs that cut into their internship hours and detract from their public service experience. Others must abandon their goals of spending a summer doing public service work entirely, a decision which has been shown to have a huge impact on future career decisions. University President Drew G. Faust herself has told us that, “students involved in public service during their undergraduate years are almost twice as likely as others to enter a public service job upon graduation.”
In addition to the insufficient number of funded internships, many of the opportunities that do exist do not sufficiently cover a student’s expenses. Internships are often in big cities where costs are especially high. About 74 percent of IOP Director’s Internships, for example, place students in Boston, New York, or Washington, three of the most expensive cities in the United States. Students also have a $2,600 summer work expectation, and most stipends are worth, at most, $4,000. This leaves $1,400 or less to cover living expenses for two to three months. Internships need to be fully funded, and that includes covering the summer work expectation required of students on financial aid.
In her 2010 commencement speech, Faust stated that, “as part of an anticipated University fundraising campaign, we will include as our explicit goals doubling the current amount of funding for undergraduate summer service opportunities.” Since then, however, we have not seen change on nearly the scale that she promised. Initiatives like the Mindich Program for Engaged Scholarship and President Faust’s Presidential Public Service Fellowship are creating great opportunities for students, but the funding sent to these programs is being offset by funding loss in other public service areas. Funding estimates based on placement numbers provided by Gene A. Corbin, the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Public Service, shows that, after adjusting for inflation, funding has risen but is still over $1.2 million away from reaching the level that Faust promised.
Only a unified institutional commitment can address this problem. A centralized source of funding with clear, objective standards for qualification would allow students to pursue issues they are passionate about without worrying about how they would support themselves. We need to minimize concerns over funding basic summer needs—transportation, housing, and food—from the decision-making process of students pursuing summer funding opportunities, so that the decisions students make can be solely about future career goals. Otherwise, the economic inequality among students that Harvard has worked so hard to combat will continue to manifest itself even as students leave campus.
The goal outlined above is certainly ambitious, but other universities have made similar achievements. For example, Duke University’s DukeEngage program guarantees one year of public service funding to every student enrolled in the university. Students credit DukeEngage with shaping their professional goals and career plans, and over 95 percent of organizations that host students say they would partner with DukeEngage again. Cornell has also made impressive steps forward, having recently committed $150 million towards community engagement for its students. Harvard can and should look to these programs as it molds a new initiative to fund public service opportunities.
We are not only told to change the world; we are told that we will be empowered to change the world. As Faust said in her 2010 commencement speech, “the development of talent in service of a better world” is the “fundamental purpose of the modern research university.” As President Faust’s term will soon come to a close, it would seem fitting to mark her legacy with the fulfillment of her vision and Harvard’s commitment—a college that guarantees all of its students the opportunity to serve the world they seek to change.
Harvard College is hosting it’s Class of 2018 Public Service Recruiting Day on October 27, 2017. We would love to know, before then, what the University is planning to do to support students in the pursuit of public service.

From schoolwork to job hunts to intramural sports, college students are propelled by the motor of competition. With the astonishing number of things that people compete over here, it may be surprising to learn that there are certain things that elicit no competition—like strong friendship. While people sometimes take pride in the quantity of their friends, few compete over the quality of those friendships. Rarer still do people strive to improve their relationship skills to deepen their friendships and romantic life.
One notable exception is a friend of mine (let’s call him Joe). His freshman year, Joe began his first romantic relationship. Thinking that he could apply his argumentative skills from high school debate to his partner’s problems, he gave her analytically rigorous advice, similar to what we are all probably used to hearing from our friends: “You are worried about that test? Here are 17 reasons you shouldn’t be worried about that test.” But she, unsurprisingly, already knew these rational solutions, and hearing them from Joe only made her feel worse.
Trying to figure out what he was doing wrong, Joe sought advice from others. Many of his friends were frank with him, saying that he was too overbearing, both to his partner, and similarly, to them. Motivated to change, Joe became a peer counselor. He soon learned that his problem-solving tactics were often a poor way to make someone feel better about their concerns, and that a non-confrontational approach, compassionate listening, and active empathy could be more successful strategies. Equally quickly, Joe realized that many of the other peer counselors in his cohort had already been expert relationship coaches before their training: While Joe had to learn how to “do” peer counseling, many of his peers had been practicing active listening and other positive relationship skills for years. Inspired by these lifelong peer counselors, Joe committed to transforming himself to be like them. Today, he believes he has improved at managing his relationships, which he credits with helping him cultivate a level of intimacy in his friendships and his next romantic relationship that otherwise would not have been possible.
More generally, people who want to rapidly improve at a given skill will attempt to surround themselves with people that possess that skill. At Harvard, I have heard people justify taking hard classes or joining certain laboratories for this reason. But Joe is the first person I have met who has applied this logic to relationships. Not surprisingly, the effects seem to be the same; just as with building academic or athletic skills, relationship skills require learning from those that are more knowledgeable.
Why are few of Joe’s classmates like him, pushing themselves to improve their emotional intelligence to be a better friend and partner to those around them? Why are Harvard students, usually ready to pounce at any opportunity to compete, so blind to hone their friendship skills? I would venture a guess that most students have not even considered building strong relationships an admirable goal worth striving toward. When most students think of social skills, they think of witty repartee at a party, or an impossibly good memory of the names of people they met in their freshman Expository Writing class. While wit is prized, the gritty consistency of a friend that always has your back is often met with blithe acceptance.
Many people simply assume that some people are “naturally” warm and kind, and rarely praise this friendliness as a genuine achievement. While some of us may be undeniably predisposed to it, this neglects the fact that some people have been successfully nurturing these skills for years. By unquestioningly accepting that some are naturally emotionally available and others are born aloof, we hide from our capacity to learn emotional intelligence, just like we can learn most things. Like Joe, if we care enough to improve our relationship skills, we might be surprised to find a new depth in our relationships with people, leading to a surprisingly profound amount of intimacy.
Who am I to tell Harvard students to compete in yet one more thing? It is not so much that I think we should be hollowly showing off our friendship chops to those around us, but rather that we should be critically reflecting upon them. And if we find our skills to be lacking, then we should not chalk this up to some sort of character fluke, but rather consider learning how to improve. In sum, we should feel a sense of ownership over the quality with which we relate to others. We should honor those who make the extra effort to care for a friend, and respect those who have mastered compassion and the art of listening.
A whole college actively working to be better friends to one another, bolstered by a spirit of “friendly” competition, could rapidly transform Harvard’s social life from a stage for quick-witted performers to impress their audience to a genuine community of support and compassion. While competition in other areas of the Harvard experience may be a necessary evil, “friendly” competition is an overlooked panacea.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She’s not like other girls. She’s an ethereal, fun-loving, free-spirited, and wide-eyed Zooey Deschanel-esque creature. She laughs when there is no joke, and dances when there is no music. She talks about sea horses and stars, but doesn’t know what a football is. She capitalizes the letters in the middle of words. She plays the ukulele. She has a bizarre name like “Alaska” or “Stargirl” that she chose for herself.
But of course, she’s also almost always white, thin, able-bodied, heterosexual, and conventionally beautiful—therefore making her strange behaviors seem “quirky” and “cute” rather than off-putting and disturbing. She’s every single girl in a John Green novel. She is a girl who “loved mysteries so much that she became one.” She “embodies the Great Perhaps.” She is the “faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl.” She is “bendable light.”
She is a mystery, an enigma. We never see her inner workings or learn too much about her. We never understand her emotions, her motivations, her fears, and her reasons for doing the eccentric things that she does. But we do know what effect she has on the people around her—especially the shy male protagonist who falls madly in love with her. He will begin as a boy, lost and confused about who he is, ready to lead a conventional and boring life—ready to go “to Duke in the fall, then go to med school, and become an oncologist, and obviously get married and have kids by thirty.” But by the end of the book or film, he will emerge as a man, his eyes opened to the infinite possibilities before him.
The manic pixie dream girl makes men become “irretrievably different” from the mere boys they were before. She teaches them “to revel”; she teaches them “to wonder”; she teaches them “to laugh.” She shows men the joys of uninhibited childhood, she makes them feel young and alive again, and she changes their lives forever.
But the manic pixie dream girl is not real. In real life, women are not mysterious enigmas whose sole purpose is to change a man’s life. Women are very much motivated by their personal beliefs, fears, desires, and ambitions. Maybe she wears different-colored socks because she forgot to do the laundry. Maybe she plays the ukulele because it reminds her of her vacation in Hawaii. There’s always a reason, a motivation, an internal dialogue.
But that internal dialogue is what makes her a real person, and not a manic pixie dream girl. The manic pixie dream girl “exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.” We never see her internal dialogue because that’s the whole point—she is never meant to be understood as a fully dimensional human being.
We never know why Stargirl insists on publicly singing happy birthday to her fellow students, or why Margo Roth Spiegelman joined the circus for a week. Alaska Young from John Green’s “Looking for Alaska” has an odd moment of self-awareness when she says, “You never get me. That’s the whole point.”
The allure of the manic pixie dream girl is that she is a mystery. And the moment we learn more about her and see the world from her point of view, that illusion is destroyed, and she is no longer a manic pixie dream girl but a normal human being. And in this way, the manic pixie dream girl can only exist in the male gaze.
Jerry Spinelli awkwardly attempted to shift from depicting Stargirl as a manic pixie dream girl to a real girl by writing a sequel “Love, Stargirl” from Stargirl’s perspective. But there’s a reason why that sequel never really took off in the same way that the predecessor did. The reason why Leo—and we, the reader—fell in love with Stargirl in the first book was because we never understood her. That was the whole point. Through Leo’s male gaze, we saw Stargirl as a pretty girl who did weird things for no apparent reason, making her absolutely adorable and attractive. The Stargirl in “Love, Stargirl” obviously did not see herself as doing quirky things for no conceivable reason—from her point of view, she was doing normal things for a reason.
That internal dialogue destroyed the illusion of Stargirl. It destroyed her magic. She was no longer the “flitting shadow of an elf owl” or “bendable light” that had so captivated Leo’s imagination. She was just a normal human girl just minding her own business and living her own life.
And in fact, that’s what women are. The protagonist Quentin in “Paper Towns” finally realizes, “Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl.” Women are real human beings with thoughts and feelings—not just pretty plot devices to aid in the growth of the male protagonist. If a fictional male character in a John Green novel can realize that, I can only hope that real-life male writers and producers can eventually realize that, too.

“When we were on the carpet we played hangman. When they only guessed afue letters, I guessed it and it was CONTRACTION…”
To be fair, we were learning all about contractions, and that list of ‘Common Contractions’ hanging above the blackboard didn’t really aid in the executioner’s cause. But this next word was a real doozy, and if someone didn’t guess it soon, our beloved hanging man was toast. After all, he was already grossly disfigured with four legs and six eyes; The Hawk, out of cruel sympathy for our ineptitude at guessing letters in an eleven-letter word, was perfectly content appending more body parts to the man with each ‘Z’, ‘X’, and ‘Q’ that we stupidly guessed until he more closely resembled a spider dangling from a web.
With two E’s on the board at positions two and four, I was truly overwhelmed at how many words in the English language could possibly make the match. But I gave it a go anyway.
“…and the same thing happened when we only got afue and I guessed it again and it was CELEBRATION...”
And there was indeed a celebration among the members of my class when the noose was loosened, and the four-legged man waddled away unscathed. The Hawk, though, was less than pleased. Her frown, targeted straight at me, said it all.
“...then Mrs. Hawkinson said if I keep getting it I wouldn’t play any more but she’s just joking.”
She’s just joking.
***
Valerie Hawkinson—lovingly dubbed “The Hawk” by her more devout first-grade disciples—was particular about many things in her classroom. But she was most particular about the manner in which her students wrote. Each entry was to be numbered at the top-center of the page, dated month-day-year in that order, indented one half of an inch, strictly illustration-less, and wholly lacking in imagination.
But if epistolary perfection was a sweet dream for The Hawk, my notebook was a nightmare. Page numbers go missing into the void and mysteriously return tens of pages later. Dates mystically warp from September 2004 to February 2016 and back again. Primitive cave drawings illustrating every facet of the six-year-old lifestyle—from the entire cast and crew of Spongebob Squarepants to a fistful of “space gook” to a detailed and clearly unrealistic schematic of an anniversary present for my parents—flank every other story.
What must have been even more unsettling for The Hawk than the format of my journal entries is the content of the writing itself. Some entries include, but are not limited to: a seven-page anthology of “Ground Hog Carrols”; a semi-accurate Hebrew-to-English transliteration of the Jewish prayer “Adon Olam”; a fully fleshed-out New Year’s Eve countdown from 100 all the way down to one; the unabridged story of Passover; and a bland recounting of a game of hangman played in class. Indeed, whenever it was time for “Centers”—a classroom activity during which the students were allowed to write in their journals—I made sure to spew recklessly each and every unchecked thought crossing my mind onto the page.
“Today is Friday. You know what that meens. Centers. And I all ready know what center I am going to go to. I’m not going to tell what. All I know is its going to be fun. Ill give you a hint? Story. That’s all the time we have today. Stay toon to find out.”
***
“hi. and my name is Ben. Were going to take a trip to my emagenation.”
During her surveying flight over the classroom to make sure her students were adhering to their delegated Centers tasks, it wasn’t uncommon for The Hawk to graciously provide the rest of the class with a sample of my work.
“to do that close your eyes. Now your at your birthday party. Now I want you to imagin whats at your partie. But”
During this all-too-common ritual, The Hawk would remove my journal from beneath my pencil mid-sentence, suspend it high above my head, well beyond the reach of my desperately grasping arms, and unfurl the notebook as though she were presenting a centerfold from a picture book. Then, she would bestow stylishly literal and avant-garde titles upon my masterpieces: “This is not an art class”, “Is this appropriate?”, and “This is not what you’re supposed to be writing about.” When the notebook was finally returned to my hands, the classroom silent with awe, I would often find myself inspired to take my writing in new, daring directions.
“THIS IS NOT WHAT YOUR SUPPOST TO BE LOOKING AT.”

Are there any benefits to placing limits on a first-grader’s creativity? “No,” says Shelley H. Carson, a researcher in Harvard’s psychology department and a lecturer at the Extension School. She is emphatic in her answer, as though it were a trick question. “I hope that teachers aren’t still doing that. I hope that teachers are encouraging children to use their imagination and write about what they’re imagining.”
Carson’s work focuses on the development of creativity in young children through adulthood. According to Carson, creativity often arises from breaking the rules and pairing diverse elements that wouldn’t normally be paired. It is this distinct melding of “X and Y”, Carson believes, that marks the difference between the creativity of a child and the creativity of an adult. “Teachers say they value creativity, but when it comes right down to it, they really discourage it. It takes them off their game plan,” she says. “Students are taught to conform, though thinking divergently is often their natural inclination.”
“When I get home I will make a hat out of paper. Then I will cut peses of paper and right littel meseges on teme. Then fold the littel peses of paper. I will pout teme in the hat go around the house and the pepol in my family will pick one of the papers.”
Whether The Hawk’s teaching methods were more suited for schoolboys or servicemen is an open question. I don’t blame her for trying to assert some control over what she must have seen as chaos. I will, however, credit her for instilling in me a sense of realism. My first-grade ramblings were ramblings, after all. “The one thing that I think about children,” Carson says, “is that they’re less disciplined. They can make these wild combinations of ideas that adults don’t combine because they haven’t learned the rules yet.”
When your mind is opened up like a book, hoisted well beyond your grasp and shouted to the world as an example of what not to do, you really do come to understand that the world has rules and that the world is not your art class. You come to understand that the most innovative thoughts are, in reality, the most unruly and undisciplined. And you come to understand that the very best ideas are best left forgotten.

“I’m sorry I lide. I forgot all about the hat I was going to make. But don’t wery. I wont forget all about it today. Plus you dont have to panick about the papers.”

Opened in 2015 as an offshoot of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, Youth2Youth Harvard Square is an entirely student-run homeless shelter serving individuals aged 18-24.
During its first two years, the shelter closed over the summers. However, this year marked an important milestone for Y2Y: The shelter piloted a new summer program, keeping their doors open for six weeks of the summer months.
After all, though the students who staff the shelter tend to leave Harvard Square after their final exams, the problem of youth homelessness remains. Few Cambridge homeless shelters remain open in the summer, which forces many to resort to living on the streets.
“Oftentimes it’s riskier for youth to stay in adult shelters because they haven’t spent as much time experiencing homelessness. They are often harassed or taken advantage of,” Y2Y Staff Director Amie R. Garcia ’19 says. “Generally, it isn’t a safe place.”
Garcia stayed in Cambridge to help manage the shelter’s new responsibilities this year. The Y2Y team appealed to the Phillips Brooks House Association, a student-run public service organization, and were granted funding for a six week session.
“Doing a summer program seemed like the natural next step,” Garcia says. “We seemed to be needed.”
Garcia says that the summer session also created a strong sense of community among the guests themselves. Since Y2Y’s summer staff was significantly smaller than its term-time team, Garcia says that the volunteers and guests formed a close bond as well.
When the shelter opens up again this fall, the staff hopes to foster the same sense of community they saw in the summer. “To see a population that is very dedicated and aware of their situation making the best, it’s inspiring,” Garcia says.

Finals week: a time for studying, screaming, and self-loathing. I walked back from Lamont on a cold Wednesday night in need of a charger, only to open the door onto a beer pong table and 20 lax bros rocking out to—you guessed it—“Mr. Brightside.” I grabbed my charger and got out of there as fast as I could. I returned two hours later, expecting to find stragglers and a mess. To my shock, everything and everyone was gone. Had it been a hallucination? The sign on the wall—“Must be 21+ to drink”—was the only evidence that this finals week bacchanal had ever happened.

Even before the musicians start playing, the sound has begun. A loud buzzing from faulty speakers bleeds in from the back of the Geological Lecture Hall, making the crowd antsy. The event’s lecturer is the aptly named Psyche Loui, a Wesleyan University neuroscientist. Loui mounts the stage wearing a tweed jacket over a t-shirt that reads “music + science = sexy.” Someone in the audience sneezes.
“That was orange,” Loui says.
This is “Hearing in Color,” the kick-off event for the national conference of the American Synesthesia Association, a non-profit founded in 1995 to support synesthesia research.
Project LENS, a group of Harvard alumni whose work connects classical music to non-musical topics, organized the event.
Synesthesia is a sensory phenomenon that causes the stimulation of one cognitive pathway to automatically activate another. For someone who experiences synesthesia, sound could have a color; numbers could have a smell. People who have synesthesia, called synesthetes, constitute about one to four percent of the population. At this event, though, that statistic shoots up. It’s hard not to wonder what else the buzzing sound from the faulty speaker is generating in the space. Does the sound create color? Taste?
Before the five featured musicians of Project LENS begin performing, audience members are encouraged to text in one-word descriptions of their feelings. Responses are projected onto two separate screens.
The non-synesthetic audience members’ responses are mostly emotional adjectives: great, fascinated, annoyed, relaxed. The synesthetes’ are abstract, descriptive: crackly, poppy, buzzy, warm, red, bronze.
Rainer A. Crosett ’14, a Project LENS co-founder, performs a piece with an intentionally wide variety of musical textures on cello: “Russian Fragments” by Rodion Shchedrin. As the music progresses, two words grow on the synesthete’s screen: yellow and orange.
Helena Melero, a synesthesia researcher at King Juan Carlos University in Spain, has multiple forms of synesthesia, among them music-color, smell-color, and sound-touch associations. She describes the sound of the cello as “in the middle of my body.”
The piece ends, and Loui stands again at the podium. “Do the yellow and the orange camp want to duke it out?” she says.
The tone of the question is playful—can sensory experience even be debated?—but later, Loui follows up sincerely. “Oh, they debate them,” she says.
“You start out thinking, it’s just this quirk, people with synesthesia,” she says. “But the more you study them the more you think, man, is everything I’m seeing actually real or is everyone just different in many very acceptable ways?”
Herein lies the impetus for many scientists to study synesthesia: the phenomenon creates a way to make inferences about sensory experience and consciousness.
Later, the musicians play a segment of the first movement of Debussey’s String Quartet three times. Each repetition attempts to embody a different taste: sweet, sour, and bitter. Though these words describe taste, they also have emotional connotations, which makes it difficult to know which association creates the experience.
“Music is a really abstract art form,” cellist and Project LENS co-founder Alan M. Toda-Ambaras ’13 says. “There really aren’t a lot of ‘sound words.’ There’s loud, soft. But not a lot.”
“We resort to looking for other vocabulary,” violinist and third Project LENS co-founder Ariel S. Mitnick ’13 adds. The descriptive language around music often calls in other senses: bright, sharp, or colorful. The musician is forced to think across senses.
Project LENS is the product of a frustrated conversation Toda-Ambaras and Mitnick had one day while riding the 1 bus. A the time, the two were a part of Harvard College’s dual degree program with the New England Conservatory (NEC), though they had known each other since they met at age 14 at the Greenwood Music Festival.
Toda-Ambaras and Mitnick felt that classical performances were not engaging new audiences; they were too long, and provided no entrypoint into the music. “We were frustrated by the perception of [classical] music, that it is an ivory-tower pursuit,” says Mitnick.
The two musicians, along with Crosett, another NEC student, wanted to create interactive events. The plan was “blending Ted-style talks with classical performance,” Mitnick says.
Project LENS, the ASA, and Harvard Brain Science Initiative reached out to Loui to speak at “Hearing in Color” based on her combined interests in music and neuroscience.
Loui is the director of Wesleyan’s MIND Lab, which studies how brain structure and function affect musical processes. She began looking at synesthesia because of her interest in absolute pitch, the ability to recognize a note’s pitch intuitively. These phenomena are both associated with unusually bright neural pathways and larger-than-average hubs of neural connectivity.
This hyperconnectivity can also make make people vulnerable to mental illness—so synesthesia research could also be a way of targeting mental health interventions. This research is still in its early stages, though, and there are inherent complications in directly targeting hyperconnectivity for treatment without jeopardizing its positive associations. Who wants to sacrifice being exceptional?
Exceptionality, though, can have its drawbacks. Carol J. Steen, ASA President and co-founder, recalls being dumped by her best friend at age seven after Steen said that the letter A was the prettiest pink she’d ever seen. “You’re weird,” came the crushing reply.
“It becomes part of your life,” Steen says. “If nothing else, to find out what happened. To find out, do other people have colored letters? To find out, are you alone?”
Here, at least, she is not. Toward the end of the event, during a Q&A period, a woman asks why music-color synesthetes always report seeing beautiful colors—pale green, gold, blue. Immediately the synesthetes in the crowd laugh and murmur in opposition: the colors, it turns out, are not always pleasant. Manifestations of synesthesia can be radically different, but there is a sense here of mutual understanding.
Some melancholy too, from the outside, of missing out on parts of experience. Being in the “out” group, it’s impossible to say what filled the space at that moment. Perhaps a warm yellow, a contented red.

It lives between the booths of small-town bars, in the eyes of shop owners, above our heads in windy public parks. The elusive notion of citizenship has fascinated Jamie E. Piltch ’17 for years—so much so that he’s chasing it across the country. Piltch has interviewed more than 100 people, visited more than 12 states, and logged at least 1200 miles in his Honda CRV for The Citizen’s Story, a journalistic project he launched in August. On his cross-country roadtrip, Piltch plans to interview 200 people and travel to 25 states, documenting his conversations with strangers about the meaning of American citizenship. He spoke with FM over Skype (with an Airbnb cat nestled in his lap) to share his experiences and what he’s learned about being American.
Editor’s note: This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
FM: What first got you interested in the idea of citizenship?
JP: My sophomore summer, I worked at Harvard Business School with David Moss to create a high school civics curriculum. Citizenship, if it’s done correctly, can be such an inclusive idea. I think there are a lot of conversations on college campuses on inclusivity, about making everyone feel valued. I think if we do citizenship and civics the right way, it seems like such a great way to help people feel like they matter.
FM: You mention on your blog that you consider freedom a group project. What kinds of community action and leadership have you encountered on the road?
JP: Freedom is a place where we come up short, both on the left and on the right. I think we as people like to invoke freedom when it works for us, but protecting other people’s freedom can make us really uneasy. In terms of seeing communities working on group projects, there was this awesome example from when I was in Detroit, sitting at an outdoor market, and I saw a community bikeshare group called MOGO taking out people from a homeless shelter to bike around Detroit for the day, paying for their lunch. For me, that’s what citizenship is all about: helping others.
FM: Can you tell us a story, personal or not, of good citizenship?
JP: The best example of citizenship was from two people I interviewed in Pittsburgh. One of their best friends was sexually assaulted during college and has now spent her whole life on sexual assault awareness and is now working on a bill that’s trying to make sure that there’s more open information on sexual assault on college campuses. That was great, inspiring citizenship. That’s the type of person I wish I could be. I have an example of bad citizenship, too. One of the people I spoke with in Detroit told me that he played on a multiracial Little League baseball team in one of the more white neighborhoods of Detroit when he was a kid. He was at a game one time, playing a team from nearby, and a parent called from the crowd, “Go back to where you came from, you little n-word.” To a 12-year-old boy playing baseball!
FM: Where or when have you felt the most American on your trip?
JP: The moment I felt most American was when I was talking with people in Detroit, specifically this one man, Adriel. We were sitting in a bar in downtown Detroit, having beers, and we were having a really open discourse about racism in our country. That felt like what America’s supposed to be for me. The project is two parts: being a citizen and being an American. For me, being an American is being open to others, being respectful to people of all races, creeds, classes, and open conversation.
FM: There’s something romantic about road tripping across America and asking people about citizenship, but it might be an easier task to accomplish as a white man. How do you reconcile your privilege with the different viewpoints of your interviewees?
JP: I see this as a way I could give voice to people who don’t often get to be interviewed on things. One of the privileges I’m tuned into on this trip is educational privilege, which I think is something we don’t talk about enough. I think it’s one thing to talk about citizenship in a Harvard classroom with other students who go to Harvard, and it’s another thing to go talk to people—to truly not understand where people are coming from and try to understand.
FM: What kinds of trends have you noticed in how people define citizenship along the lines of their political ideology?
JP: In general, people actually agree quite a lot. I’d say the biggest difference is often age. Young people are much more concerned with the political aspects of citizenship: voting, reading news sources, open discourse. Older people are much more concerned with community. Across the political spectrum, the type of citizen that everyone agrees on is what I would call the “charitable” citizen: someone who volunteers, helps others, and takes time to help the community.

The last Harry Potter movie came out in 2011. That was six years ago. Since then, Daniel Radcliffe has acted in 10 films and several plays. Emma Watson has graduated from Brown and traveled the globe as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador. Rupert Grint has bought and sold an ice cream truck. Even J. K. Rowling has set her sights on other projects, like high-profile Twitter fights with the likes of Piers Morgan and Donald Trump. Everyone, it seems, has moved on from Harry Potter.
Except Petali. For some reason, the small Mt. Auburn flower shop has transfigured its storefront into something straight out of Diagon Alley. A sign outside reads “Welcome Wizards & Muggles!”—beckoning passersby as if it were 2006.
But Petali does cast a convincing spell. My first impression, walking into the flower shop, is that the flower shop no longer sells flowers. Scarves and ties lie on a faded table, striped in red and gold. Bookshelves line the back of the room, flanked by sprightly brooms. In the shop’s recesses sit shadowed mugs and notebooks with cursive covers. Silent, downy owls peer at me from their perches on dusty tomes.
What flowers there were have faded into the background, secondary to the gnarled branch that looms over the store, hanging four banners: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff. But why Harry Potter? Why now?
I talked to John Selletto, proprietor of the shop. He calls this rebranding the “Gardens of Harry Potter.” Selletto says he periodically chooses a new theme for the store, and rearranges the whole shop around it for a limited time. Harry Potter happens to be this one.
“Our main business is a flower shop, but we like to fool around. When we get ideas, we set it up. We let it run until we get another idea,” he says. “This is something we’re fooling around with.”
The idea didn’t come from nowhere. Selletto’s brother runs The Fairy Shop, a “100 percent Harry Potter” store on Newbury Street, and a collaborator on the installation. That’s just how the two of them run their businesses—by revolving through themes. According to Selletto, the business model is working: “Gardens of Harry Potter” has attracted a lot of new customers to Petali, perhaps ones who wouldn’t be drawn into a mundane flower shop.
“They pop in because they can connect with Harry Potter or the 9 3/4 sign,” Selletto says. “Then they’re all fired up that they found a really cool flower shop and a really cool shop to get interesting gifts for people.”
It makes sense: mandrakes are the new roses these days. Nothing says “I love you” to that special someone better than a screaming plant child.
I ask Selletto if he thought about using the “Fantastic Beasts” spinoff franchise for a theme. Fantastic Beasts might not yet have the same cultural cachet, but it is certainly fresher, which might matter to a store that sells flowers. And Eddie Redmayne… Need I say more?
“That could be the next idea.” Selletto replies slowly. The idea works itself out as he speaks. “See, you just gave me an idea! That’s how it works.”

Late in the evening of October 4th, rapper Playboi Carti ad-libs to his platinum-selling single “Magnolia” for a packed arena of twenty-somethings in suits. The crowd seems uninterested. While Carti launches into the hook, they exchange business cards in the din.
“Do you have a LinkedIn?” one concert-goer yells at a girl. She nods. Both whip out their smartphones and add each other.
The concert is part of the Forbes Under 30 Summit, the fourth iteration of what Forbes editor Randall A. Lane calls the “greatest gathering of game-changers and entrepreneurs ever.”
The conceit of the conference comes from Forbes’ “30 Under 30” lists, which began in 2011 as a way to celebrate young achievers in a small selection of fields. Forbes now publishes analogous lists for Asia, Europe and Africa, and hosts live summits in three locations across the globe annually––the largest expansion yet of the “Under 30” brand, each summit drawing more than 7,000 of “the world’s top innovators.”
This year, Forbes planned a massive four-day affair—a conference aiming to blend corporate networking with a music festival vibe, all against the backdrop of historic Boston landmarks. What emerged was a sort of hybrid event, where young people line up to have their hair, makeup, and LinkedIn headshots done, and Vine star Jake Paul and Congressman Seth Moulton grace the same stage.
“It’s like the world’s best cocktail party,” Lane says. Lane has a penchant for simile––he has also likened the event to a “Davos for Millennials” and “velvet-rope South by Southwest.”
Tickets to the summit ran from $450 to over $1100 (for a by-application-only Premium experience), although over 1,000 participants attended on a free scholarship intended for those “from diverse backgrounds underrepresented in tech and finance.” All attendees had access to the U30 Village and Music Festival on Sunday and one or more of the six corporate-sponsored content tracks (such as the Impact Stage sponsored by OppenheimerFunds) that featured speakers like Ashton Kutcher, Kendrick Lamar, and Karlie Kloss during the week.
On Sunday morning, the Women@Forbes event on “Closing the Tech Gap” takes place on the top floor of the MIT Media Lab. Inside the JPMorgan Chase Lounge, young professionals in varying degrees of business casual exchange pleasantries and LinkedIn usernames, sipping on bottles of Core Hydration, a “nutrient enhanced PERFECT pH water”.
“Make sure you do follow-ups,” a young man in a speckled grey suit tells his friend. “That’s what people always forget to do. You meet someone cool? You have to follow up.” He scrolls endlessly through his list of contacts. “See? I put the name and a description. Like, John, for example. ‘John likes horror movies.’ Then I follow up.”
Sunday afternoon brings the U30 Village Open in City Hall Plaza, where Forbes seems to have fully bought into experiential marketing. Everything is labelled and treated as an experience here, from the giant board games scattered around the square to Microsoft’s espresso machine. People line up to brainstorm community service ideas in exchange for free samples at the Clif Bar booth.
In the corner of the Experiences Hub, OppenheimerFunds has set up a station where Under-30s wait to enter a box and then leave after about 30 seconds; no one knows what it’s for, or what happens inside, but there are at least 20 people in line. A sign asks “What are you in relentless pursuit of?” Apparently, the answer is free ice cream: Nearby, people line up for one of “The Official Under 30 Summit Ice Cream” flavors: Vanilla, Pumpkin, or (the “Exclusive Under 30 Flavor”) Honey Cornbread.
The Music Festival kicks off later that night, featuring Skylar Grey, Playboi Carti, and Zedd. After a tepid Skylar Grey performance, Carti bounds on stage and launches into a bass-heavy, lyric-light set. The crowd nods along. There’s a half-circle of concert-goers up front, maybe five people deep, with their hands up. Some of them know the words. Everyone else is either crossing their arms or on their phones; a khaki-suited man is scrolling through LinkedIn. Carti yells “SHOUTOUT FORBES,” launches into the chorus of his single “Fetti”––“fetti on fetti on fetti.” His DJ screams for the crowd to put their hands up, and they do.

In 1866, a Harvard student took to the pages of “The Collegian,” a new biweekly student magazine, to lament a long-standing school tradition: compulsory church services.
“The regulation in question comes down from the old times,” he wrote. “Back when even the law of the state enforced regular attendance at church—when absence from a Sunday service was considered as sure a proof of ungodliness as dancing or card playing.”
At the time, attendance at Harvard’s religious services was harshly enforced. Monitors sat in the back of the church, checking for absentees. According to the second chapter of the Laws of Harvard College, those who were late to Prayers were subjected to a “one Penny” fine and those who missed Prayers were fined “two Pence.”
Among editors at “The Collegian,” at least, this mandate was highly unpopular: In one issue, another student complains that compulsory church “amounts to a mere mockery of real worship.”
A century prior, critics had dubbed the school “Godless Harvard”—a nickname coined by Cotton and Increase Mather, who disapproved of students’ lax morals—but on the question of services, Harvard was anything but godless. But the University was did not heed the students’ concerns. The regulations stayed. Church was mandatory. Soon after, in fact, The Collegian stopped printing at the request of school administrators, allegedly due to their attacks on church services. (The magazine later resumed under a new name—“The Harvard Advocate”).
Six years later, the tides shifted. In 1873, Appleton Chapel closed for repairs. As a result, morning services were cancelled for five months. Over this period, Eliot observed “no ill effects whatever on college order or discipline.” Cheered by this good sign, Eliot softened the University’s stance on the matter. He began by petitioning Harvard’s Board of Overseers to make services optional.
The motion did not pass, partly because of the objection of one board member: Ralph Waldo Emerson. “I cannot deprive the students of such a wonderful experience,” Emerson said.
In an effort to compromise, administrators made several small reforms. In 1881, they moved morning services from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. and recruited priests of multiple denominations to conduct services. Eliot deemed these changes sufficient, calling the new services “impressive, edifying, and interesting.”
As a result, mandatory morning services continued—andsome students continued to object. In a petition to the Board of Overseers in February 1886, a literary and social organization called the O.K. Club criticized the prayers as “a mere roll-call, a practice kept up for fear of losing money.”
Finally, in June 1886, a decisive new voice ended the debate. Reverend Francis G. Peabody, the newly appointed professor in charge of morning prayers, implored that compulsory services be “stricken out.” According to Peabody, the atmosphere of the services reminded him of his time preaching in a Charlestown state prison.
With Peabody’s support, the Board of Overseers voted in 1886 to make services optional.
Not every student celebrated. On that day, some said, Harvard re-earned its old nickname. “Godless Harvard” had returned.

“Could we maybe close the door?”
I’m lying on a plastic recliner, naked as a salamander. Through the open doorframe I lock eyes with a little girl splashing around in the pool. We pretend she didn’t just see my entire ass. I’m convinced that humans have only survived this long because we learned to make these kinds of wordless covenants with strangers.
The older Korean lady turns to me. Her right eyebrow flits upward. She decides not to hear what I said and keeps washing her hands. I guess if you’re willing to get nude for one stranger, you might as well do it for two—it does seem a little ridiculous to be picky about these things.

The spa sits on the third floor of an unremarkable building in Koreatown, wedged breathlessly between barbecue joints and karaoke bars. If you hit the wrong button in the elevator, you could walk right into an office space or a wave of beefy smoke or a soju-happy rendition of “Total Eclipse of the Heart.”
I usually make my pilgrimage when the start of school is in sight. While the ides of August have many people clinging to the hard-earned summer in their hides, I am eager to shed and start anew—and I mean this very literally. I don’t go to the spa to drink citrus water or mingle in the sauna: I go to the spa to get dead skin and dirt expunged from every inch of my earthly person. I emerge 50 dollars poorer, reborn.

“Asian women are so timeless; you know that.” Since I was sixteen years old, I’ve used this line on dozens of skeptical bartenders. No one ever knows how to respond.
It’s an old trope: Asian women don’t age until they hit menopause, when they turn into the sock-and-sandal-clad gargoyles dragging wire laundry carts on the bus. We’re cherry blossom beauties until we start breathing fire and smacking medical school into our children with rolled-up newspapers.
Though prolonged youth is my purported birthright, I’ve always taken care to do a bit of maintenance. I lie down on the plastic recliner so the Korean lady can scour the passage of time from my skin. I widen my eyes when I pose for pictures. I don’t know when or why I stopped smiling with my teeth.
***
There is no sunlight in the scrub room. This is not a white-tiled nail salon of the uptown variety, where ladies with hungry blue eyes wonder, “Are the employees talking about me in strange Asian languages?” The women here are unquestionably talking about you in their native languages, and they couldn’t care less if you know.
In the scrub room, there is only dimness and a cafeteria-grade trash bin that’s filled to the brim with hot water. The scene is something out of a twisted Craigslist search: wet old young asian girl naked. It is one of the most physical and least erotic things that has ever happened to me.
The older Korean lady rolls her athletic leggings up to the knees and hikes up her shirt to reveal a black sports bra and a modest middle-aged paunch. She is not playing around in the slightest. This is a goddamn exfoliation rodeo, and you can bet it’s not her first. She dips a basin into the enormous trash can and dumps bucketfuls of hot water onto my posterior half. I’m pressed on the recliner like an unlucky pigeon on a window, so I never know when the scalding splashes might hit.
Then she straps on her exfoliation gloves, which are essentially oven mitts made out of sandpaper, and calls my newest and least frictional self into being.  I shift my eyes to get a glimpse of the debris.
You don’t realize how much junk accumulates on your outer layer until you see it plied off your body in soggy epidermal flakes. The encounter with your own cells is at once horrifying and miraculous, like peeking into your Kleenex after a gnarly noseblow. There’s disgust, then self-recognition—these clumps of filth were a part of me just moments ago—and then you wonder what other awful things your body is doing while you’re not looking. You vow to take your multivitamins.
The woman assails my outer layer like she hates it, and grins a little when I balk at the wayward organic matter scattered about. She wields the coarse loofah mitts like chisels. By the time I open my eyes, she is gone and I am naked and remade.

Ever heard of a JCR? For upperclassmen, the acronym calls to mind parties in the Junior Common Room. For freshmen, it might be the first quiz they fail.
For some first-year students, the transition to House life is difficult. The Houses are larger than most freshman dorms, and further from the Yard. Most importantly, they can be intimidating.
Many freshmen do not feel comfortable even entering upperclassmen houses before they are sorted at the end of their freshman year.
Those issues have inspired some debate: Earlier this year, the College considered completely restructuring the housing system to mirror that in place at Yale. According to this proposal, freshmen would be affiliated with a House before arriving on campus. The proposal was voted down in March after some Faculty Deans expressed concern.
Though there is currently no plan to change the housing system, recent semesters have seen new effort to familiarize freshmen with the Houses. Both the Advising Programs Office (APO) and the Freshman Dean’s Office (FDO) are implementing new initiatives to facilitate this freshmen integration.
The APO runs the Peer Advising Fellows (PAF) program, which consists of upperclassmen selected to guide freshmen through their first year. This year, PAFs are working under new guidelines geared specifically towards helping freshmen become more comfortable with House life.
This year, PAFs coordinated “PAF Group Meetings” with their freshmen advisees during Opening Days. During these two-hour long sessions, PAFs gave tours of their own houses, including visits to dining halls and dorm rooms. PAFs have been encouraged to continue these efforts throughout the rest of the year.
Yosi Fetahi ’21 and his PAF frequently have meals together in different house dining halls. “It definitely makes me feel more included, because while we’re there she introduces me to some of her friends,” Fetahi says.
Brooks Lambert-Sluder ’05, director of the PAF program, hopes that these new guidelines will enable freshmen to feel more comfortable navigating Harvard earlier on. “It’s a problem for a first-year student if you can’t go to a house and feel like you belong there,” he says.
The FDO is also experimenting with new initiatives to help freshmen integrate into house life. For the first time this year, the FDO is coordinating events that are located in upperclassmen houses but heavily marketed to freshmen. Events like the recent “Down the Rabbit Hole” party in the Leverett House Dining Hall are intended to bring the community together.
As incremental changes are made, progress clearly results—lasting change, though, may take more than a few trips from the Yard.

a non-application for harvard alum. assocation poet laureate:

to whom it may concern (a poem)
my life hangs on a silver thread
which, at any moment, could be snipped,
(and into the abyss i fall)

sweet harvard
this is not an application
i reject all conventional notions of work and success
(i write simply to remind you of my current unemployment)

i must take my rightful place
in this sinking ship that is life
and that place can only be found
within the bleeding hearts of harvard poets
(and among a whimsical nostalgia for days past)

i yearn to again feel the Harvard community,
to hear the
throbbing
pulse
of crimson pride and
solidarity

let this letter serve as a
plea
an utterance of
yearning

the choice is yours,
e.e. cummings

Application for Position of Director at HUHS:

To whom it may concern,
I have had the honor of working as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the past several months. In this position, I have spoken on behalf of our fine department to hospitals and families across the country. After 231 exhilarating days, I have discovered my talents may be put to better use elsewhere.
I think that Harvard University Health Services could benefit hugely from my expertise. I know some recent political hiccups have led the American people to believe that my passion for health and human services is less than sincere. However, this could not be farther from the truth—I poured my heart and soul into tearing down universal healthcare, and if I want a ride on a jet, God dammit, I think I deserve at least that.
Budgetary strategy is one of my strong points. I know critics will say, “He blew a million dollars on private travel!” I beg you to think of it this way—it only cost me $1 million to charter those flights. Do you know how much private planes normally cost? Military jets? I don’t think you do. $1 million is downright frugal.
I am truly in touch with the health concerns of average Americans, and Harvard students of all economic backgrounds can feel comfortable knowing that I am making informed decisions about their health. I will strive to make healthcare available to all regardless of socioeconomic status—except, of course, where birth control is involved. Birth control isn’t healthcare.  And don’t even get me started on abortion. These conversations, though, can be had once I’m sitting at my desk in Cambridge. So whaddya say?
Best,
Tom Price

To Harvard, Love Taylor:

Hey President Faust,
I’m writing to offer Harvard an exciting opportunity to work with one of the most successful artists of this generation. I’m referring, of course, to myself. I’d like to offer Harvard the chance to promote my new album, “Reputation.” The clauses are as follows:
[1]  The cover of my new album, “Reputation,” will appear on the side of Widener Library. Permanently.
[2]  The face of the John Harvard statue will be temporarily covered with an image of my new album, “Reputation,” complete with an active QR code allowing students to scan for an increased chance at obtaining concert tickets.
[3]  Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will clear his Instagram and begin posting promotional content for my new album, “Reputation.” Management will be in touch with relevant video content.
[4]  I will be awarded the status of HAA Poet Laureate and will accept the honor at the red carpet debut for my new album, “Reputation.”
I’ve heard that you’re considering giving this position to e. e. cummings, and I think it’s frankly sexist. As I’ve said before, there’s a special place in Hell for women who don’t help other women. There’s nothing I hate more than conflict; but, if you disagree, there is nothing I do better than revenge.
Hugs and Kisses,
Taylor

In the late 1970s, Andy Warhol bumped into Truman Capote at Studio 54, a nightclub. Shouting over the roar of the crowd, the two men discussed an idea—an idea that would inspire a work of art nearly five decades later.
“WarholCapote,” adapted by Rob Roth and directed by Michael Mayer, is a work of “non-fiction invention” running until October 13 at the American Repertory Theater. The play, based on a collection of long-forgotten tape recordings of conversations between Warhol and Capote, reveals the iconic duo’s unrealized hopes of creating a Broadway play together. In many ways,  “WarholCapote” is the show that never was.
Stephen N. Spinella, who plays Warhol in the production, says that the found footage used in the play mirrors a reality television format. “If Andy were alive today—I don’t know if he would have been fascinated by [reality television], or appalled by it, or both,” he says. Warhol was interested in television—in the 80s, he hosted a talk show on MTV called “Fifteen Minutes.”
Obtaining the necessary permission to make a play with such intimate recordings posed a major challenge. Because Warhol had recorded several high-profile celebrities without their consent, the Andy Warhol Foundation had initially banned the tapes from public use. Eventually, Spinella says, the board came around after several members voiced concerns about “ignoring an unfound work of art by Andy Warhol.”
Spinella says Warhol’s audio diaries helped him to understand the artist’s personal life and ensure that he was not creating a caricature of the artist. Painting an accurate representation, however, is difficult: “The character that you’re seeing up on that stage is not a biography or a documentary of Andy Warhol,” Spinella says. “It is a character, probably a little more Andy Warhol than Julius Caesar is Julius Caesar in Shakespeare’s ‘Julius Caesar.’ He only gets three words attributed to Caesar, whereas everything I say is attributed to Andy Warhol.”
The raw, unedited nature of Warhol’s tapes offers surprising insights into his private life, especially his insecurities. At one point, Warhol soliloquizes: “They’re all like me so similar and so peculiar but they’re being so artistic and I’m being so commercial that I feel funny,” he said. “I guess if I thought that I were really good I wouldn’t feel funny seeing them all.”
Time has shown that Warhol has gotten his fifteen minute of fame—and then some—but Spinella hopes posthumous fame will continue to be kind to Warhol. He thinks that “WarholCapote” can help to make that happen. “There’s so many really forgotten fascinating people in history and this kind of stuff is how you open the eyes of a new generation to really, really fascinating people. I hope [“WarholCapote”] has a life beyond the ART, and if it does—I think it will do that.”

Dr. Alice Hamilton was pleased to see that the room was not luxurious.
Tired of the extravagance of hotels across Europe, she was relieved to find the last room waiting for her in Geneva distinctly un-flashy. As Hamilton wrote in a 1924 letter to her sister, the room had “everything one needs but no luxuries.”
Having left her family home in Hadlyme, Connecticut two weeks before, Hamilton arrived in Belgium and immediately boarded a sleeper train for France. From Strausburg, she journeyed through Lausanne before crossing over into Switzerland, the final destination of the arduous trip. This dizzying schedule was consistent with the pace of her career.
Hamilton was appointed to the faculty of Harvard Medical School in 1918. Six years later, Hamilton arrived at her bare-bones room in Geneva, ready to serve on the League of Nations Health Committee. “I meant to tell the League when they offer me my per diem, that I can pay that myself,” she wrote to her sister Margaret .
At both Harvard and the League of Nations, Hamilton stood alone. She was the leading authority in her fields, a pioneer in the field of workplace safety and in research on lead, carbon monoxide, and mercury poisoning. Hamilton was the first woman to become a professor at Harvard Medical School. She was also the only woman to serve on the League of Nations Health Committee from 1924 to 1930.
Hamilton’s story begins, though, long before the League or Harvard left invitations in her mailbox. Hamilton grew up the second of five children (four sisters, one brother), first in Fort Wayne, Indiana and then at “finishing school” in Connecticut. Both in her childhood home and away at boarding school, Hamilton lived amid intimate sibling camaraderie and an intense dedication to academics.
“We were expected,” Margaret Hamilton wrote, “to know literature—French, German, and English.” The Hamilton sisters emerged from this childhood well-learned and primed for success. Academics, however, were rarely forced upon them. “One did not study these subjects; they were to be read and enjoyed,” she wrote. “Modern languages were learned by conversation and reading. Latin and mathematics were our only lessons.”
By the time Alice Hamilton began classes at the University of Michigan Medical School (a path one could take directly from high school at the time), her interest in science had expanded beyond simple enjoyment. From Michigan, Hamilton snaked a path across the globe with her clinical and research-based pursuits—from Minneapolis to Boston, Munich to Baltimore, ultimately finding her way to Chicago.
When Hamilton took a job at the Women’s Medical School at Northwestern in 1897, much of her decision to move to Chicago centered on a house: Hull House, a settlement house in inner-city education, to be specific. It was at Hull House, while teaching English and art, that Hamilton first observed the effects harmful substances could have on workers’ health. Her research career rocketed from there.
By 1916, Hamilton was the world’s premier authority on lead poisoning research. Led by academic as well as humanitarian motivations, she worked in Chicago and Paris before receiving a letter in the mail she most likely thought would never come: an offer to work at Harvard University.
Harvard Medical School Dean David L. Edsall reached out to Hamilton in 1918, offering her an Assistant Professorship in Industrial Medicine. The leadership and faculty of the school was all-male at the time, and many tasked with determining the fate of Hamilton’s career would have preferred to keep their workspace free of women. Edsall, though, remained confident.
“The interest in it has been such, and has increased so rapidly that we feel a good deal of confidence that by keeping at it we shall soon find ourselves on a permanently firm basis.” Edsall wrote in a 1918 letter.
Hamilton’s appointment was approved in 1918, making her the first female faculty member employed by Harvard University.
Three major restrictions kept Hamilton from full-fledged faculty status, though. She was not allowed in the Faculty Club, the commanding brick old-boys-club that did not grant women access until 1968. She could not participate in the commencement procession. And, devastatingly, she was denied faculty tickets to Harvard football games.
But the sexism Hamilton experienced at Harvard didn’t compare to what she’d feel serving the League of Nations in 1924. “I thought it was discipline enough in humility to be on the Harvard faculty, but this is much worse,” Hamilton wrote in a letter to her sister Margaret. “I am an utter ignoramus and can only sit and listen and blush if I am asked a question.”
The League got under Hamilton’s skin, but it didn’t stop her career. From Geneva, Hamilton went on to become a consultant, researcher and author—working intently to advance the field of industrial toxicology in Washington D.C. and Germany. After she retired, she continued to conduct research and work as a consultant for various government and private enterprises, even penning an autobiography in 1943.
Hamilton shattered more than one glass ceiling over the course of her long career, a feat that often took its toll.
“You may imagine me from now on, going along dripping streets in my loden coat, to endless committees where I sit silent but much interested, then again through pouring cold rains to the Maison Internationals for dinner and an early bed, or to dress and go out and meet more League people till my head buzzes with all the talk,” Hamilton wrote in the final paragraph of her Geneva letter to Margaret. “Two weeks of it will be quite enough.”

“I have identified as bisexual for 41 years and one month,” award-winning activist, educator, and former Harvard administrator Robyn T. Ochs said at the start of her talk in Ticknor Lounge on Thursday, October 5.
Since 1982, Ochs has advocated for greater visibility for what she calls “the middle sexualities.” A self-proclaimed “professional bisexual,” Ochs returned to Harvard this month to present “Beyond Bisexuality 101,” an event focused on fighting bisexual erasure and biphobia.  Afterwards, Ochs sat down with FM to discuss what the term bisexual means to her, fighting transphobia, and challenging the gender binary.
Editor’s note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
FM: Today is also your birthday. Can you take us back to when you were 18?
RO: I started college and developed a major crush on a woman and then spent a considerable percentage of my waking hours trying to figure out what it meant and how to integrate that into my understanding of myself. Then I got stuck in the place between knowing and being. I had no idea how to operationalize my bisexuality. I was frozen with fear and I spent five years silent and anxious and suffocating. Five years later, someone came out to me and that gave me permission to come out myself. One of the challenges of coming out is that it can be hard to bring it up in conversation—speaking of bisexuality, which, you know, I am—I wasn’t even sure how to raise the topic. We’re still part of a culture where people say, “I don’t go around telling people I’m straight, I don’t see why you have to go around telling people you’re bi.” But the reality is that heterosexuality is the default assumption, so straight people don’t have to come out. That’s the privilege of straightness.
FM: How did you move from identifying with that label personally to becoming a “professional bisexual?”
RO:  I showed up at a meeting at the Women’s Center where the discussion topic was bisexuality. Out of that, we founded the Boston Bisexual Women’s Network, the longest existing bisexual women’s organization in the world. We were a grassroots, unstructured, skin-of-our-teeth organization. We were in a moment of history where it was time for that to happen because if you look around the United States, many bi organizations started in the early and mid-80’s. We forced them, we made the debates happen. So many different groups of people were starting to advocate for this more intersectional frame.
FM: How has this presidency shaped your activism?
RO: As I travel around the country, I see so much more distress. I see people very afraid of what’s going to happen to them. It’s not so obvious in Cambridge but when I go to Oklahoma or Ohio or Michigan or most parts of the country, people are anxious and afraid—afraid that what little gains we’ve had will be turned back. I hope that the next thing that happens is a backlash to the backlash.
FM: Now I want to shift to labels. Some people are challenging the term “bisexual,” saying it affirms the gender binary. Why do you claim that term?
RO: I think that term has historical value and what bi activists have done is redefine it. The “bi” in bisexual for me now is “attracted to genders similar to my own and different from my own.” So the “bi” is not men or women, it’s similar and different. That’s an adaption that has allowed that word to exist as we’ve found new frames. It’s an adaption that’s allowed me to continue to use this word and incorporate our increasing knowledge that gender is not binary. I also identify as pansexual and queer, I think all these words heavily overlap. What I don’t want to see is that horizontal hostility. I don’t think it’s productive for bi and pan people to be at odds with one another. I think we should be fighting together for that middle sexuality space and for the right to hold nonbinary identities.
FM:  There has been a rise in gender neutral clothing in a lot of mainstream companies and fashion houses. Do you see this commodification of non-binary identities as negative?
RO: I think there’s always a danger of commodification. It always has its risks and it can be used for evil. On the positive side, these objects, whether they be t-shirts, pins, or hairstyles, can also be used to make visible what is normally not seen. The power of wearing a bisexual pride t-shirt in public is that everyone who sees you will receive that information. For some people that will provide a possibility model—and that’s powerful. I know I feel happy when I see one—when I see a bumper sticker or a t-shirt, I get that rush of joy. You have to use some tool to demarcate some alternate identity than what people assume. For me that’s why [these objects] can be a tool of empowerment.
FM: What is the best way for people, whether they identify as LGBTQ+ or not, to actively support the community?
RO: One of the things that happened to me a lot when I was doing marriage equality work was so many people coming up to me and saying, “Oh good for you, I support you, I hope you win.” I kept thinking, “Are you phone banking, are you contributing money, are you showing up to our rallies?” We need your concrete material help. Being an ally for me would be saying, “Oh that’s great. I support you.” Being an accomplice is doing something about it.

It’s Housing Day, and hordes of boisterous upperclassmen decked out in colorful t-shirts and mascot costumes yell chants and wave signs from the steps of University Hall.
Within Harvard Yard’s dorms, groups of bleary-eyed freshmen listen nervously to the din as they wait for the mass of spirited students to disperse across the Yard. One of these screaming upperclassmen holds an envelope detailing  their residential fate for the next three years, a housing assignment they have no way of knowing or controlling.
Upperclassmen scatter into the dorms by 8:30 a.m., tearing up staircases and down hallways with much more energy than is typical for an early Thursday morning. They chant house names in earnest before nearly banging down the door of up to eight nervous freshmen. This group, called a blocking group, is then presented with an official letter announcing their housing assignment, and is then engulfed by a strong showing of House spirit. The upperclassmen move to their next group of freshman targets.
Housing Day was not always marked by uncertainty. The Houses only began randomizing their populations in the fall of 1996, before then students had some say in their Housing assignment. In the 1960s, this meant an interview process, and in the 1970s, a ranked preference system was introduced. As a result, the Houses of the mid- to late-twentieth century were tightly-knit communities centered around common interests. A contentious move at the time,  randomization thrust Harvard into a new era.
But randomization also means that the House spirit demonstrated on Housing Day is the exception, not the rule.
The move to make each house a purposeful microcosm of the College’s student body came at the expense of the Houses that were pockets of community centered around shared identities, academic interests, and extracurriculars.
The College maintains  that the “central goal” of the House system is “forging a link between learning and living.” To forge this link, the Houses keep “an assortment of intellectual activities and traditions” as well as “robust cultural and social opportunities.”
The outsized importance of extracurricular activities and social clubs seems to reveal the difficulties of such a vision. “The House is definitely not the center of social life,” Jake A. Morrissey ’18 says.
Harvard wants  to change that.
Ongoing renovations look to do more than just bring the historic House buildings into the 21st century. Amid campus-wide debate on Harvard’s social landscape, some hope that the time is ripe to breathe life into a tired social scene stifled by a socially fractured student body.
Thirty years ago, the Harvard Houses were “sort of like a grown-up high school, with different cliques,” according to Quincy House resident faculty member Timothy P. McCarthy ’93.
Students preferred certain Houses for more than their location or look: Houses also had distinct personalities in the late eighties and early nineties. A 1993 Crimson article called Adams “liberal, artsy, and daring.” The House was more than just left-leaning; Adams was a haven for many gay and lesbian students in a time when their sexuality was not widely accepted.
Kirkland was the athlete’s House.  A 1991 Kirkland House sweatshirt was modeled after that of the Harvard Department of Athletics, with “Let’s Just Stop Pretending” emblazoned across the back. In the mid 1980s, Kirkland housed 90 percent of varsity athletes in three sports, according to a Crimson article from 1995.
Eliot was known as the WASP House; in 1993, the House t-shirt featured the slogan “Are you on the guest list?” Quincy was known to be a more studious House with a high concentration of pre-med students. Dunster was a “mini Adams...with more of a social justice, public service kind of bent,” according to McCarthy.
The Quad was “vibrant,” and “one of the most racially diverse sections of campus,” former president of the Black Student’s Association Kristen M. Clarke ’97 recalls.  In 1996, only 11 percent of juniors and seniors at the college were black, while 25 percent of juniors and seniors living in Quad houses were black, according to a student-produced report. Clarke describes her time in Currier House as “a core part of my social experience on campus.”
These distinctive communities within the Houses were an “opportunity for students who were in search of that kind of support network and system on campus at that time,” says Clarke.
Such support networks, while often crucial for undergraduates, were not necessarily aligned with the original intention of the House system. Conceptualized in 1930, the House system imagined by President Abbot Lowell proclaimed “each House should be as nearly as possible a cross-section of the College.”
By the late 20th century, this was not the case. Then-Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ‘57 and other House administrators worried about self-segregation, expressing concern over “a situation where several Houses had severely skewed populations in some areas.”
In 1990, the system reformed into a system of “non-ordered choice,” in which freshman blocking groups selected four Houses and would most likely be placed in one of those four. Though the system introduced an element of randomness, students retained a degree of control over House selection and Houses remained relatively homogenous.
A 1994 report on House life declared the current Housing system did not “reflect the richness and complexity of the student body.”
“We...consider forces that encourage segregation to be of serious concern,” the report said. The lack of diversity among the Houses was troubling to college administrators, as was the notion of self-segregation.
The Committee arrived at a solution: randomization. In May of 1995, Jewett announced that starting with the class of 1999, freshman rooming groups would have no choice in their housing assignment.
Students did not yield quietly to Jewett’s decision; the announcement prompted a 200-student protest on the steps of University Hall.
At the protest,  Adams House resident tutor Carsey Yee likened randomization to “taking all the gays and lesbians in San Francisco and New York and relocating them in even numbers throughout the United States.”
Many students of color protested randomization as well. The randomization decision “stands out as one of the most racially polarizing moments from my experience at Harvard,” Clarke says. “It was clear that there were some folks who were just deeply disturbed by the notion that African American students and other students of color might enjoy living around each other.”
But the administration stood its ground. In 1996, sophomore blocking groups were randomly assigned Houses. By 1998, each House reflected the College’s increasingly diverse student body.
The era immediately following randomization saw the campus open up. Before randomization, most houses restricted swipe access for non-residents. In 1999, Universal Keycard Access began, granting all students the ability to swipe into any House. Despite being unevenly implemented due to years of contention, and holdout by certain Houses, the policy opened up the free flow of students between Houses that were once insular enclaves.
But as students left their own Houses to swipe into others, so did the parties, McCarthy says. Coupled with a crackdown on drinking, he describes seeing fewer and fewer House-specific parties as the 2000s came and went.  Once marked by DJ’s and kegs, a Friday night in Quincy Dining Hall today just sees a few scattered students studying up into the late hours of the night.
The Houses’ populations have become undeniably more diverse, but Houses often struggle to bridge students’ many disparate interests and form supportive communities.
“I don’t think anyone goes into a House thinking, ‘This is where I belong,’” Mather House Committee co-chair Philip M. Ramirez ’18, an inactive Crimson editor, says. “But at the same time, we’ve gained that diversity. Just being able to meet people from across the school. So it’s a balance.”
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 agrees. “My sense is that [randomization] is a success,” he says. “That is to say that students have said to me any number of times, this was the best idea, I’m meeting people I never would have met if I was left to my own devices.”
Much of the responsibility of balancing this newfound diversity with historical House character falls upon Faculty Deans and the residential staff of each house. Some Faculty Deans try to preserve identity through tradition. Adams House Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, who took over the House just after randomization, said he made a concerted effort to preserve the institutions—including drag night, the Pool Theater and the Bow and Arrow Press—that reflected the House’s old identity.
“That doesn’t mean that the Adams House of today is the same artistic, diverse place that it used to be, but it is still an artistic, diverse place,” Palfrey says.
Other initiatives are more prescriptive: Harvard brings back pre-2000s swipe restriction one day a week, in the name of community. On Community Dinner night, students are required to eat in their own Houses, which oftentimes proves to foster more irritation than camaraderie.
“Most of the time, community dinner to students just seems like another dinner. And, I’ll be quite frank, it’s not that hard to sneak into other dining halls if you want to meet up with other friends,” Ramirez says.
House Committees work in partnership with Faculty Deans and House administrators in creating a sense of House community. “We think that if social life is going to be recentered on the Houses, we’re going to be the ones that are going to lead that charge,” Cabot HoCo Chair Jack W. Deschler ’19 says.
These student liaisons are tasked with building a House’s character. “HoCo really drives a lot of the traditions in the Houses,” Ramirez says. “A good HoCo can really embrace the House architecture and the people in the House and really make students enjoy living there.”
HoCo’s ability to enliven House life is incumbent on the space available. Not every House has a large, rentable space like Cabot’s Aquarium, Mather’s concrete JCR, or Pforzheimer’s Igloo. As a result, residents of “party suites”—a suite large enough to host dozens of people—take on outsize roles in House life.
Some party suites are required, by HoCo or house administration, to throw a certain amount of open parties for their House. Even if there is no formal party mandate, at the very least there is an “unwritten rule,” Aren G. Rendell ’19, resident of a large suite in Kirkland known as the 10-Man, says.
“It becomes a little exclusive of people who don’t have the means necessarily to go to New Hampshire and buy $700 worth of alcohol for the semester,” Matthew T. “Teddy” Brokaw ’18, a Currier 10-Man resident, adds.
The brunt of responsibility for generating community within a House falls upon a self-selecting group of enthusiastic students. Outside of that, student levels of House involvement exists along a spectrum. While 43 percent of students surveyed in The Crimson’s 2015 House Life survey reported that they were “somewhat involved” in House life, only 12 percent were “very involved,” while 45 percent were “not very” or “not at all involved.”
The Adams courtyard is lively on a balmy Thursday night; a student band churns out mid-2000s rock hits and dozens mill about, eating, drinking and socializing in anticipation of the weekend. For many House residents, Stein Clubs (or “Carpes,” as Adams calls them) are a strong source of House involvement. Other House events such as formals are often well-attended, but ultimately, the vast majority of Harvard undergrads find their social communities elsewhere.
“There are definitely some extracurriculars that have some social aspects that the House doesn’t offer,” Perry M. Arrasmith ’18 says.
Such extracurricular groups are only growing in number—there are currently 442 recognized student organizations at Harvard. This growth has been so significant that the Office of Student Life announced in February 2017 that they would not accept any applications for new student groups for the remainder of the spring semester.
Other students join a different kind of club.
Harvard has 24 fraternities, sororities, and final clubs. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of undergraduates are a member of at least one. Many clubs own or lease buildings in the heart of Harvard Square, though none are residential.
For the College administration, which has historically turned a blind eye to unrecognized social life, the exclusivity of these groups has become too much to ignore. This time, however, Harvard could not press a “randomize” button: Final clubs are independently owned properties.
In May 2016, Harvard began to crack down on final clubs and Greek life. A new policy was introduced to impose penalties on members of these groups, barring them from campus leadership positions, sports captaincies, and post-graduate fellowships.
Re-centering social life on the Houses has emerged as a top priority of the College in recent years. In an internal document circulated two months before Harvard announced the sanctions, administrators listed “re-center social life in the House” on the top of a list of college-sponsored actions to reduce the influence of final clubs.
“I think a really important part of what we’re trying to do is to make sure that House life continues to be vibrant,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said last year.
Just as it did with House randomization, Harvard is receiving significant opposition for its actions.
Lewis oversaw randomization during the very beginning of his tenure as Dean of the College. He referred to randomization as an effort to establish the principle that “problems of unequal treatment of women, problems of gay students being unwelcome, problems of ethnic conflict or religious...were everybody’s problems.”
Ironically, Lewis has emerged as the lead opponent to the College’s most recent effort to target enclaves of homogeneity. He opposes the policy on principle, but also doubts that it will positively impact House life. “I think there’s a view that student’s social life is some kind of fluid, and if you dam it up and prevent people from having their social life off campus, then it will all enliven what happens in the Houses. I’m somewhat skeptical of that,” Lewis says.
Others worry that moving large parties back into the Houses will be a nuisance. Last semester, some social clubs brought their events right to the heart of some Houses, and held parties in venues recently opened for party use—like the Mather JCR and the Adams K-Space—to the ire of House administrators.
Aiming to provide more centralized direction to House-based social life,  the College has amped up funding for undergraduate social events, which saw a 73 percent increase from 2014 to 2016, and another 15 percent in the 2016-17 academic year. A significant portion of this funding has come from University President Drew G. Faust’s discretionary fund.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said she believes the Office of Student Life—which allocates the College’s social budget—should facilitate, rather than lead, student social activity, bearing in mind that “not all social life is going to happen in the Houses, nor do students necessarily want that to happen in the Houses.”
While the social scene will always have a component outside of the houses, the OSL and top administrators are still making a concerted effort to shift Harvard’s social life paradigm to its 12 undergraduate communities. They have continually met with HoCos to discuss how to do so. In addition to HoCo’s yearly designated budget, the College has directly funded House initiatives such as the Yardfest neighborhood block parties.
Yet HoCos often find themselves competing with extracurricular organizations for additional event funding, and some think the College could do better. Ramirez argues that if the College does want to bring the best parties and activities back to the Houses, current funding for the House Committees is insufficient.
“Quite frankly, we just don’t have the funding that a lot of these social groups do,” Ramirez said.
Amid questions of funding and focus, Harvard hopes for the College’s modern social life to return to the Houses. When it gets there, the College wants the Houses to look modern, too.
The Lowell Belltower, once a distinctive landmark of Harvard Square, is now shrouded in scaffolding. A maze of construction barriers redirects foot traffic around the center of the project, leading pedestrians to Kirkland, Eliot, and newly-renovated Winthrop.
The House Renewal Program—Harvard’s ongoing renovations of House buildings—calls itself “an initiative to enhance the student experience and foster intellectual, social, and personal transformation.” Aiming to be more than a mere facelift to fix cracked floors and chipped paint, Harvard believes this project can breathe new life into old places.
The program is estimated to total $1.4 billion, and the first phase focuses on the eight “Neo-Georgian” river houses. Winthrop opened its newly renovated doors this fall, following Dunster’s completed renovation in 2015. Lowell is under construction until 2019, and Adams renewal is scheduled to begin that same year.
Administrators have made an effort to consider each house’s specific architectural tradition and character throughout the process. “For each of the Houses that have gone under renewal, we [have sat] with the Faculty Deans and the students to understand the culture and what matters historically,” Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith, who oversees the House Renewal project, said.
Though renovations are House-specific, tailored to each building’s history and needs, a few trends have emerged.
Dunster’s renovation mainly drew praise from residents despite a few snarky “motel” comparisons. The renovation also made the House entirely handicap accessible, a main priority of the renewal plan and requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Before renovations, most of Harvard’s neo-Georgian houses consisted of narrow vertical stairways in each entryway—keeping students with disabilities from accessing these rooms.
However, one change struck a chord of discontentment: Dunster students complained that not enough priority was being placed on private in-suite common rooms.
The concerns about the layout of rooms in the Houses rings a familiar bell:  the College’s decades-long balancing act of fostering bonding among students with common interests while simultaneously striving for inclusivity.
Some feel that fewer suites means fewer parties there, too.  “I think a lot of students want to party without someone always peering over their shoulder,” Ramirez says.
Administrators and architects took concerns about common space into account for the second go-round of renovating an entire House: Winthrop.
"Due to the feedback and use statistics, future projects should include fewer hallway common rooms and the number of suites should be increased where possible,”  a 2016 assessment report on renewal said. “A broader issue regarding the lack of private party space was also raised, which should be addressed in future Renewal projects."
The report also declared that hallway doubles would be eliminated going forward in subsequent Houses, and that Winthrop would have “a significantly higher percentage of singles and suites.”
Still, when Winthrop opened in August,  despite having 72% of beds in suites, some residents had similar complaints: in-suite common space was perceived to be shrinking, and this was limiting social options for blocking groups.
In September, architects conducted a walk-through of Adams House—which is slated for renewal beginning in 2019—to hear from students about what they cherished about the House’s architecture.
Palfrey is grateful that Adams will be the sixth renovation, as the College has learned from the past and is developing a more finely-tuned approach to preserving House character. “There will be no ‘Motel Six’ in Adams House,” he says.
Stephanie Robinson, a faculty dean of Winthrop is thrilled with the House’s new common spaces. In the old Winthrop, the dining hall was the only true opportunity for congregation.
While in-suite common space may be limited, today’s Winthrop is full of House-wide common spaces, allowing residents to have more choice in how they interact with their housemates. “You run into people all over the place because there are so many places that people can actually just be,” says Robinson.
Experts affirm the importance of spaces that foster casual run-ins. “Some of the best conversations in an office happen near the water cooler, or in a party some of the best moment happen in a kitchen,” Graduate School of Design lecturer Sergio Lopez-Pineiro says.
While not everyone is pleased with renewed Houses’ social spaces, residents of updated Houses appreciate the modern, clean, and pest-free facilities.“The renovations have made people happier,” says Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., Winthrop Faculty Dean. “When you interact with students whose plumbing works, and whose facilities are nice and agreeable, the starting point is different and the interactions with the deans as a result are markedly different.”
The Houses may never again be the enclaves of social identity that they once were—but that’s not necessarily what 21st century students want.
“There are people who aren’t necessarily part of the Adams community but still feel strongly attached to the House in other ways,” Adams HoCo chair Ryan M. Ward ’18 says.
Today, with extracurricular involvement, campus mobility and connectedness at peak highs, Harvard must ask itself how it will shape the next era in residential life at the College. Renewing physical space helps, but real change in culture requires a willingness to adapt.
Despite investing over $1 billion dollars in it, Harvard knows that House Renewal will not be a panacea for creating vibrancy in the Houses. The College continues to consider ways to improve House life.
Last year, Harvard considered a proposal to adopt Yale’s residential model, in which undergraduates are placed in a “college”—Yale’s equivalent of a House—from the time they set foot on campus as freshmen. At Harvard, undergraduates only are part of the House system from their sophomore year.
In Yale’s model, while freshmen still live among other freshmen in their first year, students can only choose among people assigned to their same college to live with for subsequent years in the college.
Last semester’s proposal to bring the model to Harvard was scrapped, after pushback from Faculty Deans who said supporting and creating programming for freshmen would be too much of a burden.
Again, Harvard finds itself challenged when weighing how to champion both diversity and belonging.
As it looks to overhaul social life, and potentially ban final clubs and Greek life, it has turned to peer institutions for guidance on how to revitalize residential life after forcing social groups out.
A recent report by a committee tasked with examining Harvard’s social group sanctions looked into residential life at Bowdoin and Williams.  Both institutions took swift action and banned social clubs from their campuses decades ago. The colleges bought out fraternity houses and turned them into residential houses.
Bowdoin and Williams are different places than Harvard; they are small and rural. Policies are rarely one-size-fits-all. But one lesson that they can give is clear: that strong action with targeted purpose can bring massive change to what may seem institutionalized.
At the dawn of the randomization era amidst change and uncertainty, the College hired a new cohort of House Masters—now Faculty Deans—to guide the Houses into the future. Judy and Sean Palfrey were one such pair.
“We were in part chosen because we wanted that challenge of taking the best of the old nonrandomized houses—each of us had a house character—keep some of that, and build on it, so that it now embraces diversity and moves forward on it,” Sean Palfrey says.
Eighteen years later, he has stayed on to face a similar challenge: seeing Adams through renewal.
Doing so requires what he did when he first came to the helm of the House: carefully preserving character elements of the past to keep, while realizing a new, modern era lies ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale University—the Ivy League school known for consistently leading the pack in annual investment returns—returned 11.3 percent on its investments for fiscal year 2017.
The returns trail behind other peer institutions, though they topped Harvard's. Dartmouth College leads the Ivy League with 14.6 percent returns, while the University of Pennsylvania and Brown returned 14.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively. Only Columbia has yet to release its results.
While it may not be at the top of the class this year, Yale still managed to outperform Harvard, which posted a “disappointing” 8.1 percent on its endowment investments this fiscal year. Historically, the two endowments have been the envy of the higher education financial world, but in recent years, Harvard Management Company has fallen behind.
The Harvard endowment is now valued at $37.1 billion, roughly $10 billion more than Yale’s.
For a long time, the two endowments were structured in fundamentally different ways. Harvard used a “hybrid” model that leveraged internal money managers with some external talent. Yale, on the other hand, outsources the majority of its assets to external managers.
In the last year, Harvard has moved closer to that model as HMC’s endowment chief N.P. Narvekar embarks on an ambitious restructuring of the firm’s investment strategy. The majority of its teams have been outsourced, with only a few high-performing teams remaining in house. Nearly half of the firm’s staff—which, at around 230, was unusually large for a college endowment—will be laid off by the end of the calendar year.\

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard Law Review selected more female editors than male editors to join the prestigious journal’s ranks this summer, welcoming a majority-female class for the first time in the publication’s history.
The editorial class, chosen after a rigorous competition tested the skills of prospective first-year law students, consists of 24 women and 22 men.
ImeIme A. Umana ’14, the president of the Law Review, wrote in an email that the publication made efforts this year to reach as many first-year Law students as possible during their recruiting process, hosting panels and casual coffee chats with current editors.
“These efforts, we hoped, demystified the competition and encouraged students not to count themselves out of joining the journal,” Umana wrote.
Leila Bijan, one of the newly selected editors and a vice president of the Women’s Law Association, said she counted the names on the list she was sent the day she was accepted and was very impressed by the number of women.
“It actually caught my eye that there were a lot of women on there, and I went through and I counted that there were more women than men,” Bijan said. “I remember telling one of my friends that and I think his reaction was, ‘Oh I don’t know, that doesn’t sound like something that would happen on the Law Review.’”
Seth R. Berliner, the vice president of the Law Review, wrote in an email that increased representation of women on the publication is a good sign for diversity in the legal profession more broadly.
“The editors of the Harvard Law Review go on to be leaders of the legal community,” Berliner said. “It's heartening to see that, for the second year in a row, the Review has elected a class of editors that is more broadly representative of the world around us.”
Last year, the legal journal elected the most diverse class of editors in its history, and in 2013 it expanded its affirmative action policy to include gender as a factor in its admissions process. Umana herself is the Law Review’s first black woman to lead the organization.
“Bringing together editors from different backgrounds uniquely enriches our writing and editing process.  Perhaps more importantly, achieving gender parity underscores an unequivocal truth: women belong on the Law Review,” Umana said.

A team at the Law School chipped in on the work of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, providing legal advice as the group negotiated an unprecedented disarmament treaty.
The Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic joined ICAN in its work to pass a United Nations treaty in July asking countries to abolish their nuclear weapon programs and supplies. Fifty-three countries have so far signed the treaty, though the world’s nine major nuclear powers—including the United States—have boycotted the negotiations.
The IHRC group included four Law School students—Molly Doggett, Alice L.M. Osman, Carina M. Bentata Gryting, and Lan Mei—as well as Anna Crowe, an instructor at the clinic and Bonnie Docherty, a lecturer at the Law School.
“The treaty is a major step and a major step towards nuclear disarmament. It is not the end itself so we’d love to have nuclear states on board, but we’re not surprised and not concerned that they’re not on board,” Crowe said.
The treaty has met resistance from nations who criticize it as naive: In July, UN ambassadors for the United States, Britain, and France wrote a joint statement arguing that it “clearly disregards the realities of the international security environment.”
Crowe, however, said the treaty “sets a really high standard and stigmatizes nuclear armament”—critical first steps to reducing the world supply of nuclear weapons.
Matthew Bolton, a political science professor at Pace University who was also involved in the ICAN project, characterized the treaty as “a really good opportunity to put back on the table something that many people here in the United States and other nuclear-armed places have forgotten...which is that nuclear weapons cause tremendous harm.”
Docherty said the Law clinic was heavily involved with the project over the spring and summer, but had been working on humanitarian disarmament for years.
“When it became clear that the nuclear weapons issue was going to be taken up by the UN and there were going to be negotiations on a treaty, we immediately got engaged and offered our services to ICAN,” she said.
Crowe added that there is still significant work to be done on nuclear disarmament, and that a new team has been created to continue the progress of the clinic in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Talk show hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski encouraged students to get involved in public service—and lobbed the occasional insult at President Donald Trump—at an Institute of Politics town hall Wednesday.
After an introduction from University President Drew G. Faust, Scarborough and Brzezinski—who are Visiting Fellows at the Institute of Politics this semester—fielded questions and comments from the audience on topics ranging from political rhetoric to healthcare and immigration. Most questions concerned the United States’ current political climate, which students widely characterized as divisive and uncertain.
Scarborough said he felt that many Americans lived in political bubbles and remain unexposed to opposing opinions. He said that young people interested in running for office should do so, adding that an increased level of public scrutiny against elected officials has likely turned many away from careers in politics.
“The quality of public servants across the country has dipped, it has declined, and it has because politics has become a blood sport,” he said. “If [military service members] can put up with what they put up with for this country, you can run for office and put up with a few nasty tweets and Russian Facebook posts.”
Brzezinski said she thinks an influx of young Democratic candidates can help the party regain popularity.
“I think that’s why [Democrats] failed actually, we lost our authentic voice,” Brzezinski added.
In an interview with The Crimson before the event, Scarborough and Brzezinski—who are engaged and host “Morning Joe” together on MSNBC—both said that they viewed America’s two-party system as outdated.
Scarborough said a broken party system enabled Trump’s win in 2016. He added that candidates like Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders had capitalized on a nationwide fatigue with the party system.
“I think political parties are creatures of a bygone era,” Scarborough said, “If we had healthy political parties right now, there would be an answer to Donald Trump. Donald Trump actually wouldn’t have happened. Donald Trump is the result of a sickness in American politics that I think has been fed by hyper-partisanship for the past 20 years.”
Scarborough and Brzezinski also praised efforts at Harvard to hear from controversial figures, referencing recent talks by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and controversial sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 that drew peaceful protests.
“Harvard’s doing a great job right now of protecting people like Secretary DeVos...she came here and she was able to talk,” Scarborough said, “Charles Murray, this is a guy that has written things that many people have found very offensive… the next morning I saw him say ‘I cannot believe how open minded they were and how they treated me with respect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Significant numbers of deaths from interactions with law enforcement go unrecorded, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found in a study released Tuesday.
The study found that 93.1 percent of U.S. police-related deaths in 2015 were recorded by The Counted, a database run by The Guardian, while only 44.9 percent were documented as such by the National Vital Statistics System, which is managed by the federal government.
Justin M. Feldman, the study’s lead author and a doctoral student at the School of Public Health, said their research proved their hypothesis that police-related deaths are more likely to go unreported in low-income counties and for people “killed by non-firearm mechanisms.”
Feldman said that the underreporting of police-related deaths is caused by misclassification, not omission of cases.
“Everyone who dies goes into the NVSS; the question is whether they are classified as being killed by the police, assigned the diagnostic code of legal intervention, or homicide,” Feldman said.
Feldman added that he sees the relative accuracy of news sources in reporting such deaths as helpful, but a bad sign for the government.
“Local news reports are the best source of data we have right now of police killings… The other side is that it’s not really the role of media to be doing the government’s job,” Feldman said.
To his surprise, Feldman said his team found “no difference” in levels of underreporting in death certificates completed by medical examiners and coroners, whom Nancy Krieger—a Public Health School professor and author of the study—said are often political appointees. And when it comes to race and underreporting, Feldman said, “it gets a little complicated.”
While their study found no direct connection between underreporting and ethnicity, more people of color were killed by the police in regions with the largest underreporting, in states like Texas, Florida, and Oklahoma.
“If you were to analyze the [Centers for Disease Control's] data as is without correcting it, you would undercount the number of black people killed by the police,” Feldman said.
The results of the study raise the question of whether or not this undercounting is intentional.  Feldman and Krieger, referring to the myriad of factors affecting the reporting of data, suggested that it would be impossible to pinpoint a cause from their study.
“What we could say from the study,” Krieger said, “because we can only speak to the results, is that the underreporting was highest for people who were black, who were under age eighteen, who lived in low income counties, and who were killed by non-firearm methods.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Charles A. Murray ’65 spoke at Harvard on Sept. 6, the controversial sociologist left behind more than just a few remarks on his scholarship—the Cambridge Police Department charged his alma mater $12,000 in security fees.
Dozens of students and local residents turned out to protest Murray’s appearance, drawing  officers from both the Harvard University Police Department and the CPD. Murray, whose views on race have long drawn widespread criticism, sparked violence when he appeared at Middlebury College last year: Students forcibly prevented Murray from speaking and injured a professor in the process.
Harvard administrators were willing to pay a premium to prevent a similar outcome. As controversial speakers like Murray draw vigorous on-campus protest, Harvard has increasingly turned to CPD and HUPD for support, shelling out upwards of $10,000 per event in a trend experts say will only continue.
Over the past semester and a half, three highly polarizing figures—Murray, ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos—have visited Cambridge, each drawing scores of protesters and a heavy police presence. At the DeVos event on Sept. 28, for example, at least 15 cops—some with bomb-sniffing dogs—surveilled the roughly 300 demonstrators outside while nearly a dozen officers monitored the secretary’s speech indoors.
Harvard won’t say how much it spends on campus police. Administrators from the College and Kennedy School either declined to answer questions or did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that it is the department’s “longstanding policy” not to “discuss staffing levels or security measures.”
But costs to CPD alone can run above $10,000, according to department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. And with the added amount the University must pay its own police force, campus security experts estimate Harvard’s total expenses at more than twice that number.
Policing expert Brett Meade said he thought Harvard’s security charges for the DeVos speech and counter-demonstration “easily” ran to tens of thousands of dollars. Meade, a fellow at policing research group the Police Foundation, also serves as Deputy Chief of Police at the University of Central Florida.
Some analysts predict Harvard’s security expenses will only rise in coming months.
“I don’t have any figures to give you, but I can guarantee you that the cost is going up for everybody,” Police Foundation president Jim Bueermann said. “Even though you may not be able to get the numbers [from Harvard], this I think is the reality for universities today.”
Steven J. Healy, the CEO of campus security consulting company Margolis Healy, agreed.
“The landscape is different than it was five years ago, ten years ago,” said Healy, who previously served as Director of Public Safety at Princeton. “There is a wider acknowledgement that… promoting free speech is not free—given the current climate, there tends to be a greater awakening of oppositional voices, so that brings protest and that costs money.”
Harvard must also devote more time and manpower to pre-demonstration preparations. Archon Fung, academic dean for the Kennedy School, said the school holds “extensive” planning sessions before high-profile, controversial speakers come to campus.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller did not respond to multiple requests asking to discuss how the College prepares for controversial speakers and protests.
Fung said administrators at the very highest levels of the Kennedy School, including Executive Dean John A. Haigh, attend these discussions. After working out “what the situation is likely to be” and “what kind of security is called for,” officials reach out to Harvard University police, Fung said.
Usually, Harvard police then notify a liaison at the Cambridge Police Department who “deploy[s] resources accordingly,” department spokesperson Warnick said.
Fung said that, in his nearly two decades at Harvard, he has never once heard Kennedy School administrators balk at possible event security costs.
“I’ve never been in a conversation where somebody said, ‘Oh, there’s a tradeoff here between the safety and security concerns and some amount of resources and so we can’t afford it,” Fung said. “I’ve never been in a conversation like that.”
He added he has “no idea” what the Kennedy School’s security costs are.
Fung said Kennedy School administrators have already started planning for Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer’s upcoming trips to Cambridge. The Kennedy School has yet to name firm dates for either visit.
Lewandowski is President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager. Spicer served as White House Press Secretary until he resigned in July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An early defensive misplay would come back to haunt Harvard women’s soccer on Wednesday night at Boston University’s Nickerson Field.
In the sixth minute, a misplayed pass by the Crimson defense led to a breakaway and a chance for BU freshman Anna Heilferty, who put Harvard in an early 1-0 hole. BU senior Christina Wakefield, who has started each of the Terriers’ 15 games, assisted on the play to up her team-leading tally to two assists to go along with four goals on the season.
In what was primarily a one-sided affair, however, Heilferty’s early strike was enough to give the Terriers (6-6-3, 3-1-1 Patriot League) the victory. BU registered 20 shots, compared to six for Harvard, and cruised to a 1-0 win.
The Crimson (7-6, 1-2 Ivy League) entered Wednesday’s game, the final non-conference tilt of the season, fresh off a 3-1 victory over Cornell on Saturday. And Harvard had history on its side, holding a 13-7-6 lead over BU in the series’ history. Last year’s contest between the crosstown rivals ended in a 2-2 double overtime tie in Cambridge.
“BU…is currently near the top of their conference,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We knew we would get a good test.”
The Terriers entered play with a 4-3-0 home record in 2017. BU had lost only one of its previous six contests. Over that stretch, the Terriers had outscored their opponents 11-1, with five shutouts. Last night’s game extended that defensive dominance.
“We knew BU is a very good team,” captain Caroline Chagares said. “They have a very tall back line.”
BU’s offense also performed. The home team applied enormous pressure throughout the first half, dominating possession and earning the lion’s share of scoring chances. The hosts dwarfed Harvard’s two shots with 11 of its own, five of which landed on goal.
The Crimson was fortunate to enter the intermission trailing by only one goal, as Wakefield followed her assist with an effort that struck the post, narrowly missing an opportunity to double the lead.
The second half proved to be more of the same for the Crimson, with chances coming few and far between. Harvard recorded a paltry four shots over the final 45 minutes.
On the other side of the pitch, the Crimson defense, along with goalkeepers sophomore Kat Hess and junior Danielle Etzel, did well to keep Harvard within striking distance. But as was the case in recent games against Penn and Yale, the offense was unable to break through the BU defense.
In keeping with recent strategy, Hamblin played Hess and Etzel for a half each, with Etzel conceding the goal but parrying away four shots. Hess, a native of Newport Beach, CA., entered in the second half, saving three Terrier shots to keep the score at 1-0.
Harvard played more conservatively than it might have in Ivy League play, trying to keep the deficit at one goal.
“Of course our goal tonight was to win the game,” Hamblin said. “But we were focused on our defensive shape as well to make sure that we don’t concede.”
Sophomore Kimaya Cole led the Crimson with two shots, both of which were on goal. However, freshman goalkeeper Amanda Fay stymied these two effort, as well as all others.
“I think we started out a bit frantic,” Chagares said. “We want to try to turn their back line and get at them. We ended up getting most of our chances at the end of the second half.”
The Crimson, short-handed without captains Marie Becker and Chagares, utilized a deep bench, substituting six players into the game.
“We had some holes out on the field to fill,” Hamblin said. “But as a result we had an opportunity to experiment with different players in some different positions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football coach Tim Murphy has spent a decade preaching about the parity of the Ivy League. It’s time for us to listen.
For years, we could dismiss the sermonizing because Harvard was so dominant. The Crimson hasn’t fallen to Dartmouth or Columbia in 10 years. The program has claimed three of the last five championships. Last season’s loss to Yale ended a nine-game streak.
In 2017, however, the Ancient Eight is a barroom brawl. Seven teams have legitimate title aspirations. Princeton, picked to win the conference, doesn’t have an Ivy win. Neither does Penn, picked to finish third. Meanwhile, Columbia—which stomached 24 straight defeats between 2013 and 2015—owns a 4-0 record.
So far, Harvard has played Brown and Cornell, likely the two weakest programs in the Ancient Eight this year. The Crimson has emerged with a 1-1 record. The Big Red did more than defeat Harvard. Cornell truly overpowered its opponent, racking up 233 rushing yards and owning a 13:40 advantage in time of possession.
Not long ago, the Crimson and the Quakers owned the Ancient Eight. One of these teams shared the title in nine of the last 12 years. Gone are the days of Ancient Eight stability. What we’re seeing in 2017 is the dissolution of the traditional power structure. What we’re seeing is an Ivy League revolution.
It’s tempting to dismiss this shift as an early-season blip. Football writers have done so before. “Our kids and our coaches know that there is so much parity in this league,” Murphy said in Oct. 2004. That quote appeared under the title “League Parity Doesn’t Really Exist.” Indeed, led by quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘09, the Crimson went 10-0 with an average margin of 20.5 points per game.
A similar scenario played out in 2015, my first season as a football writer. “The competition in the league is better than it’s ever been,” Murphy said during the preseason.” You can probably make a strong case that every team in our league is going to be better than they were a year ago…maybe other than Harvard.” The Crimson proceeded to go 9-1 and secure a championship three-peat.
Most seasons, pundits claim that the Penn-Harvard reign has ended—that the Ivy League has developed into a truly competitive conference. Most seasons, the Quakers or the Crimson prove otherwise. But 2017 is different. Parity is real and here to stay.
It used to be the case that only the Crimson pumped out NFL players. Of the 25 Ancient Eight alumni who made August—a group that included veterans such as Ryan Fitzpatrick and Desmond Bryant ‘09—13 hailed from Harvard. This makeup has shifted in recent years. The last two Ivy classes produced 10 NFL graduates. Only three came from Cambridge, Mass.
As Murphy knows, bad teams can beat better ones. Witness the 2017 Rhode Island Rams, who now stand 1-4 but dropped the Crimson in September. Murphy has a reason to fear every adversary, from the seemingly benign (Yale last year) to the obviously intimidating (Penn last year). Early-season upsets can give the illusion of true competitiveness.
The difference is, there are no bad teams this year (or maybe one—sorry, Brown). In 2017, almost all of Harvard’s remaining opponents fall into the “obviously intimidating” category. The Crimson is 2-2 and still must play the six most challenging league foes. The Tigers are salivating at the chance to avenge an overtime loss to Harvard in 2016. The Bulldogs are averaging over 40 points per game. The Quakers have the most talented player in the Ancient Eight. The Lions may have the best defense.
Even an upcoming matchup with Lafayette offers little respite. The Leopards have jumped to a 2-0 start in conference play thanks to wins over Holy Cross and Fordham. The Lafayette defense, which has given up two touchdowns in the last 120 minutes, will challenge Harvard.
All these external opponents loom, and the Crimson has some internal challenges, too. Freshman quarterback Jake Smith is surprisingly capable—elusive, smart, and accurate. He’s also young and turnover-prone. Against Cornell, the defensive line proved toothless, and the offensive line let up five sacks.
The matchup with the Leopards offers a chance to fine-tune these units—a critical venture given the parity of the Ancient Eight.
