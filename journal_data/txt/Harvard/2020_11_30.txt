After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the romanticization of bloodshed to the white savior trope, films about the Vietnam War have received their fair share of often well-deserved criticism. Many have come to view these films as a failed attempt made by American directors to justify the United States’ actions in Vietnam by glorifying individual soldiers. It's a relief, then, that Spike Lee's "Da 5 Bloods" takes a decidedly different approach as Lee refuses to perpetuate this characterization of the war. Starting the film with excessively violent and authentic footage from the Vietnam War (which lacked a much-needed trigger warning), Lee makes himself clear: He has no desire to glamorize the brutality that millions of people endured.
Forty-five years after the end of the war, four Black veterans: Paul (Delroy Lindo), Otis (Clarke Peters), Eddie (Norm Lewis), and Melvin (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) reunite in Vietnam for what they claim is an expedition to find the remains of their squad leader Stormin’ Norman (one of Chadwick Boseman’s final roles). They seek to reunite the five “Bloods,” the nickname they created for their squad during the war. It is later revealed, however, that this is only part of the goal, as the veterans are also searching for $17 million worth of gold bars that their squad took from the United States’ government as “reparations.” Now that recent mudslides have revealed the squad’s old landmarks, they, along with Paul’s son, David (Jonathan Majors) who added himself to the mission, return to the Vietnamese countryside for the first time since the war ended.
As the aforementioned violence Lee uses to open his film foreshadows, the veterans are unable to easily remove the gold from the hillside. Whether by active minefields or clashes with armed local Vietnamese gangs, several of the Bloods and the French members of LAMB (Love Against Mines and Bombs) meet untimely and extremely gruesome deaths. The only Blood who survives the trip is Otis, along with Paul’s son, and they distribute the wealth amongst themselves, the families of their fallen friends, LAMB, and a chapter of Black Lives Matter. The film concludes with Norman’s remains finally being returned to the United States and a segment of a speech given by Martin Luther King Jr. at Riverside Church.
Spike Lee deviates from the standard white-focused Vietnam War film by centering Black veterans. Lee is well known for telling stories of Black heroes largely ignored by Hollywood or the history books. Though "Da 5 Bloods" may be a fictional story, the dilemmas that Lee’s characters face are not. Like the rest of the United States, the Black community was divided by the Vietnam War. Many, such as Martin Luther King Jr., opposed the war, describing it as another form of American colonialism. Many Black citizens also refused to risk their lives in Vietnam when they were still treated as second-class citizens in the United States. On the other hand, others in the Black community believed that by serving in the Vietnam War they would gain respectability: By demonstrating their patriotism, perhaps they would come home to an America that no longer oppressed them.
"Da 5 Bloods" seems firmly convinced that those promises to Black soldiers were a false hope. In one scene, while the Bloods are idly waiting for orders, they listen to a radio broadcast, where Lee seems to address this idea directly. A Vietnamese woman addresses the Black GIs, questioning why they serve in higher proportion than white Americans, and fight the Vietnamese “so far away from where [they] are needed,” referring to the violence against Black Americans during the Civil Rights Movement.
Later on during the war, the United States sent gold to pay local Vietnamese soldiers fighting alongside American troops, and tasked the five Bloods to recover that gold when the plane went down. With the gold symbolizing reparations or the civil rights Black Americans had yet to receive even after the Civil Rights Movement, Lee’s message becomes apparent: those Black Americans who had chosen to fight in Vietnam in hopes of gaining more rights returned to the States without them. This is reinforced by the excerpt from King’s speech Lee includes: “America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear.” Hunting for the gold even after the war, the five Bloods demonstrate Lee’s argument that Black Americans are still seeking reparations today and only gained a portion of them despite their bloodshed and sacrifice.
Spike Lee’s film comes at a time when, unfortunately, many Black Americans are still fighting for the “gold” left by the Bloods in Vietnam. Although Lee critiques the idea of Black Americans using military service to gain favorability with white America, "Da 5 Bloods" serves as a timely reminder of the countless contributions Black Americans have made to the United States. In its critique of the false promises made to Black veterans of the Vietnam War, "Da 5 Bloods" serves as a larger reminder of the many ways America's promises of equity for Black Americans have gone unfulfilled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Totally absurd until it isn’t, the 1997 film “Wag the Dog” still manages to feel prescient despite its age and thematic distance from current American politics. In the realest sense possible, we are living in the film’s own world — except dialed up many, many notches.
The film shocked audiences not once, but three times due to its eerie similarities with the Clinton impeachment trial, the 1999 attempt to bomb Iraq, and the 1999 Kosovo War. At the beginning of the film, the President of the United States (Michael Belson) is weathering the crisis of his sex scandal, and hires spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) to make the problem go away. To do so, he hires director Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to film fake footage of the bombing of an Albanian village (complete with a white kitten and a young Kirsten Dunst), a bunch of old friends to write a folk song to celebrate a Prisoner of War beyond the Albanian border, and create a cult of personality around said POW.
Crazy how all these real-world events magically seemed to echo a movie released before they transpired — it’s as though America loves bread and circuses so dearly as to distract from critical thinking and engaged citizenship. The film’s largest deviation from reality lies in the subtlety of the characters’ machinations: Now, we watch Tweets unfurl themselves, spokespeople spread lies on television, and scandal after scandal paint themselves across front pages of newspapers. In short, it’s become so obvious that everything is a coverup for something else that we don’t even know where to look.
The film’s success lies in its ability to capitalize upon some of the deepest and most defining traits of the American public: The love of pageantry, the nationalism-disguised-as-patriotism, and the folksy origin tales that attempt to camouflage this country’s laundry list of committed atrocities. It asks the viewer to ponder whether America’s brand of mythology is actually true, or whether it was crafted by a few rich oligarchs who would do anything to manipulate the psyches of the working classes in order to maintain their power.
One has to laugh while watching because everything about the film makes sense: Of course the viewer knows that digging up a record from the Library of Congress and highlighting how it is the perfect fight song for the campaign to bring home the abandoned POW is a deus ex machina. Yet the film’s magic lies in simply pointing this out and sitting back while you apply its internal logic to real political machinations.
Think about the scenario in the US shortly before the election: one week the discourse surrounds the president’s wish to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, two weeks before that it was the debate, a few weeks before that he had coronavirus, and shortly before that it was the tax bombshell. The above timeline fails to consider all the small, daily, and unceasing disruptions emanating from the White House, which now undermine fair elections and ignore the devastation of coronavirus. But all the scandals and crises become a circular pattern, in that the public goes from one scandal to another only to begin at the beginning and unearth a problem anyone following along had mentally blocked out.
“Wag the Dog” is less frenetic, but by no means less relevant. Of course, one other major difference might be that the film’s cast intentionally manufactures problems that can easily go away, whereas our current moment is made up entirely of grave mistakes, disinterest, a lack of empathy, and incompetence. The film is funny, unlike the present. And it has a self-awareness that makes it both ridiculous and sobering. It would be funny if it weren’t tragic — all the way down to Motss’ rejoinder when someone tells him he should do something about his dislike of politics: “Me? No, I don’t vote.”

Netflix’s latest animated film, "Over The Moon," pays homage to the Mid-Autumn Festival — a Chinese tradition that spotlights families, mooncakes, and of course, the legend of the ancient moon goddess, Chang’e. The film is also a tribute to screenwriter Audrey Wells, who recently passed away after a battle with cancer. Perhaps it's fitting that "Over the Moon" gives a voice to the emotional struggles of a young girl, Fei Fei (Cathy Ang), who is plunged into mourning when she loses her mother. Although directors Glen Keane and John Kars tell a sweet, touching story, "Over the Moon" falls short of the high standards set by competing studios like Disney and Pixar. Keane's and Kars's film is colorful but lacks cogency, cute but cliché, and imaginative but not sufficiently introspective.
The opening sequence is beautifully illustrated, as Fei Fei’s mother gently serenades the family with Chang’e’s wistful tale. Just as Chang’e waits for her lover on the moon, Fei Fei struggles to move on from her mother’s death. But four years on, her father decides to remarry. In child-like petulance, Fei Fei builds a rocket and journeys to the moon in order to prove that Chang’e is real.
But even with a basic premise, "Over the Moon" runs into narrative problems. It's difficult to distill what Fei Fei sets out to accomplish with her mission to the moon — and it doesn't help that her character arc succumbs to contrived plot devices. It is unfortunate that Keane and Kars don't focus on the film's emotional core: Fei Fei is rarely given the opportunity to reconcile with her personal loss. Instead, "Over The Moon" seems content running on childlike adrenaline, as audiences are taken on an arbitrary quest that is incongruous with the grief and frustration she grapples with.
Fei Fei’s journey through space is structured around the quest for a MacGuffin, with a couple of unconvincing red herrings thrown around along the way. It's a by-the-numbers setup that leads to a dissatisfying denouement — one which serves to be more disappointing than expected because it's easy to predict the intended "plot-twist."
That said, the film offers a few redeeming qualities. For instance, some of the fantastical characters Fei Fei meets in space bear a striking resemblance to close friends or family members from home, such as three space birds who are voiced by the same actors who play Fei Fei's aunts and uncles. This contributes to the implication that Fei Fei is living in her own self-constructed consciousness.
Beyond plot and character, “Over The Moon” also falls short from an animation standpoint, especially compared to the high standards set by Disney and Pixar. The dreamed-up space animals are either poor caricatures of their earthly forms, or clear rip-offs from other animations. For instance, one of the creatures, Gobi, is described as a luminescent green pangolin, but it's difficult to tell what the character is supposed to be from the film's finished illustrations. Other characters simply look like engorged Angry Birds. On the other hand, "Over the Moon" does a good job with its human character designs: Each has gorgeously expressive eyes and dainty button noses. They're even animated to exhibit mannerisms that coincide with their body weight, such as how Fei Fei's heavyset grandpa hobbles instead of walks, and how her hyperactive stepbrother-to-be, Chin (Robert Chiu), bounces around when he moves. The moon goddess’ flawlessly designed wardrobe of traditional Chinese garments also deserves a special mention –– especially her silk-woven Hanfu (a ceremonial dress).
One litmus test for a film's quality is how rewatchable it is. It's difficult to see "Over the Moon" passing that test: Keane's and Kars's film will likely struggle to retain adult audiences, although it could appeal to younger ones with its catchy soundtrack and slapstick humour. While "Over the Moon" is a substandard entry for Netflix, it's a recommended animation for families with younger children who want to commemorate the Mid-Autumn Festival with a sweet, timeless message: “And if you give love / You’ll never lose love”.

This November, Netflix dropped a plethora of time-tested films, from family comedies to moody dramas. With films featuring the talents of Shawn Mendes, Stanley Kubrick, Dolly Parton, John Legend, Timothée Chalamet and more, this winter promises to be filled with exciting stories to stream.
"A Clockwork Orange" — November 1
A cult-classic for the ages, this film dives into the psyche of a broken man, Malcolm McDowell's Alex Delarge, endowed with heinous "ultraviolence" tendencies in a dystopian future Britain. Now facing a life behind bars, Alex joins a special program to reform him into a new citizen. As one of Kubrick’s most beloved films, “A Clockwork Orange,” released in 1971, is a masterpiece and a must-watch.
"Easy A" — November 1
"Easy A,” starring Emma Stone and Amanda Bynes, is a more lighthearted entry on this list, but still a wholly enjoyable film. “Easy A” is far from the cult classic “A Clockwork Orange” is, but this quirky high school rom-com should be a sure-fire watch this fall. As Emma Stone’s Olive struggles with the spread of risque rumors, the audience gets to see a witty and hilarious modern take on Hester Prynne. With incredibly fun acting and clever writing, this movie might not have won any Oscars, but it did get nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress — Comedy or Musical. It might be important to have “the talk” if watching with a younger audience, but this otherwise family-friendly comedy will be sure to get some laughs.
"Fruitvale Station" — November 12
"Fruitvale Station" is the powerful true story about the life and death of Oscar Grant III on the night of the 31st of December. Ryan Coogler’s film tells an intriguing story about the racism demonstrated by police departments to this day. Oscar (Michael B. Jordan) — with the help of his mother Grace (Octavia Spencer) — tries to get a head start on his New Year's resolutions to keep his drug-muddled, scandalous past behind him and work on being a better father and husband, only to find himself shot on New Year’s Eve. With many recent events stocking the fire of racial tension in America, seeing a true story about how a life can change on a dime solely because of the color of one’s skin may provide an opportunity to learn about how our neighbors are living and remind each other that racism is not an old problem, but one very present today.
"V for Vendetta" — November 15
A tyrannical, fascist government reigns in a fictional Britain in the 2005 classic "V for Vendetta." With only one man willing to stand up to the forces that be, “V for Vendetta” is a film perfectly apt for today’s progressive movements around the globe. With Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving as its stars, “V for Vendetta” will be another joy to see on Netflix this winter.
“Hillbilly Elegy” — November 24
Taking a turn for the somber and dramatic, “Hillbilly Elegy” is based on the memoir of the same name by J.D. Vance. This true story explores the American Dream through the perspective of a man who fought through a rough upbringing to find his place in the Ivy League. J.D. (Gabriel Basso) is a Yale law student who gets dragged back into his childhood home to help his family. In a time where the American Dream seems like a figment of the imagination, this story promises to be one which will elucidate one man’s struggle to find purpose and reflect on the possibility of achieving one’s dreams. “Hillbilly Elegy” is set to be an emotional and compelling story about family values and privilege in America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a former Congressman, I strongly encourage newly elected members of Congress to attend the bipartisan orientation program sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, which will be held virtually over four days beginning on Dec. 7. The program — formally titled the “Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress” — fosters bipartisan civility and matters now more than ever.
It’s the 20th anniversary of my attendance at the Kennedy School’s freshman orientation program, as I journeyed to Cambridge in December 2000 as a newly elected member of the House of Representatives from Florida. The country was divided following a bitterly contested presidential election that came down to a Supreme Court ruling and 537 votes in my own state. The American people were starving for civility and bipartisanship from their government.
Sound familiar?
Regrettably, there has been some controversy about the Harvard Kennedy School’s freshman orientation program over the years. For example, in 1994, all Republicans boycotted the event claiming that Harvard was too left-leaning. In 2018, some Democrats attending the orientation complained there were CEO speakers but not enough labor union speakers.
These complaints all missed the mark. They underestimated the value of a representative keeping an open mind to all sides. After all, would it kill a Republican to hear what a left-leaning Harvard professor has to say about improving access to higher education for poorer students? Would it be so bad for a Democrat to listen to what a right-leaning CEO has to say about how to create more jobs in the private sector?
The program I attended in 2000 attracted a broad bipartisan group of new members from Florida to California, many of whom have since become well-known. The attendees included the then-youngest member of Congress Adam H. Putnam (R-Fla.), future Trump Impeachment Manager Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), future Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.), and future Senators Jeffry L. Flake (R-Ariz.), and Mark S. Kirk (R-Ill.). I made good use of my time at Harvard in the midst of such good company.
For example, I drafted my first piece of bipartisan legislation at the Kennedy School’s orientation. I used my spare minutes between panels writing up a bill to expand Pell Grants, which I filed my first day in Congress. President George W. Bush later gave me the pen he used to sign my Pell Grant legislation into law, and I was promoted to Chairman of the House Higher Education subcommittee.
Over four days, we received policy briefings from prominent experts, including Cabinet secretaries, senior White House aides, business leaders, and Harvard faculty on a wide variety of topics — including the federal budget, foreign policy, and education reform — to help us hit the ground running when we arrived in Washington.
At Harvard, panel discussion topics included relations between Congress and the White House and speakers like David R. Gergen (a White House adviser for Presidents Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Richard Nixon), Kenneth M. Duberstein (Ronald Reagan’s Chief of Staff), and Anne L. Wexler (an assistant to Jimmy Carter).
Wexler gave particularly sage advice. “Always remember that in Washington there are no permanent friends and no permanent enemies,” she said. “Civility is the watchword.” As someone who served eight years in Congress, I can tell you that she was correct.
For me, the most helpful practical advice came from a Harvard faculty member who talked to us about coping with stress. He suggested we do one small habit every day to bring a sense of stability and accomplishment to our crazy lives. So I took a short jog every morning at 6 a.m. no matter where I was, including Alaska, D.C., Florida, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. And he was right. The daily habit made my chaotic life feel more stable, more structured, and less stressful.
The 1994 GOP members who boycotted might have learned a thing or two from Harvard professors. Who knows? I sure did.
But perhaps the greatest benefit of the Harvard program was getting to know my new colleagues in a relaxed setting — Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Adam Schiff come to mind as colleagues I first met at Harvard. Those bipartisan friendships endured.
During these crazy times, bipartisanship matters more than ever. I hope that the newly-elected members of Congress will give civility a chance. The Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics is doing its part.
Richard “Ric" Keller (R-Fla.), a Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress attendee in 2000, served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001-2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, Harvard custodians protested, calling on the University to guarantee it would not lay off any custodial workers this coming spring. The University agreed to such workload protections in March, when directly employed and, notably, contract workers were guaranteed regular pay and benefits through the end of May even if the COVID-19 pandemic prevented them from performing their normal duties.
Now Harvard and members of its custodial staff are at a sticking point. “Continued financial pressures” have led Harvard to reverse previously guaranteed worker protections, according to the University’s Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp. Despite (literal) rallying cries from staff, as of Nov. 12, the University has left the workers it directly employs with fewer workload protections than before, and its 300 contracted custodial workers with seemingly none.
We’ve often written about the tension between Harvard, the Corporation, and Harvard, the University and in particular how that bears on labor practices. Now, more than ever, is a time for Harvard to act as a community steward, and, yes, probably at the expense of its bottom line.
The University’s unwillingness to guarantee pay for all of its employees speaks to the pull of corporate Harvard on its decision making.
But if it truly considers its staff an integral part of its “learning and living” community, then those instincts have to be let down.
We understand that Harvard may well be under legitimate financial strain and that growth of the endowment — which returned 7.3 percent in 2020, bringing its valuation to $41.9 billion — doesn’t mean the University is suddenly financially unburdened. We know it’s been a tough year for the University. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, for example, incurred $30 million in unforeseen expenses and lost revenue in fiscal year 2020.
But shouldn’t Harvard protect its employees even, or especially, during financially tough times? Everyone is taking a financial hit right now — better to do so boldly and in the name of care of our community. If Harvard really considers staff to be vital members of the Harvard community, then protecting them should happen even at a loss.
In justifying why the University would no longer guarantee staff regular pay and benefits, Vice President Lapp cited issuing students room and board refunds as one of the “difficult, yet necessary decision[s]” that put Harvard at a financial loss; further losses, she predicted, will come from students deferring admission and requiring increased financial aid. No doubt, supporting these student needs has been the right thing for the University to do. But it shouldn’t preclude a similar generosity toward the workers who make that room and board possible in the first place.
Further, the distinction between directly employed and subcontracted employees should not factor into the University’s treatment of its workers. That equally necessary and involved workers are treated differently illustrates the untenable nature of the subcontracting model. Harvard should not only guarantee the continued employment of these subcontracted employees, but in a more long-term shift towards fair labor practices, move toward direct employment and more permanent protections.
Harvard’s employees’ level of need brought on by the pandemic has remained constant, if not increased, since the spring, when these issues first arose. That we’re having the same debates now is disappointing to say the least. Harvard’s support for its employees should be in touch with the ongoing reality of their struggles.
As we wrote in regards to the University’s treatment of graduate students in the spring, generosity is most powerful when it moves from the top down. All across the world, people are having to take losses in order to care for each other and themselves. Harvard will have to continue to make sacrifices — perhaps some of the biggest in its history — to support its community. That’s going above and beyond, but that excellence is what we expect of this institution.
A fiscal loss will be a moral and communal victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Without fail, Harvard Economics professor Isaiah S. Andrews rises at 6:45 a.m. every day.
He finishes his workout by 8:15, then grabs breakfast and showers before 9:30. For the rest of the day, Andrews works at his standing desk overlooking downtown Boston, conferencing with colleagues and students. At 8 p.m., he cooks with his husband, Welton E. Blount ’09, then reads or plays video games. He goes to bed by 10:15, and the cycle repeats the next day.
It’s an ordinary routine for an extraordinary man.
Andrews was named a 2020 MacArthur Fellow in October, receiving $625,000 for his work overcoming statistical inference problems in empirical economics. The grant itself gives him flexibility to take more unpaid leave and focus on research, Andrews explained, but it is also a tremendous honor in its own right.
“The ‘genius’ label is setting the bar way too high, but it’s definitely a really, really encouraging and really great vote of enthusiasm for my work,” Andrews said. “It’s also nice just as a recognition or as a sign of enthusiasm for the broader set of issues I work with.”
The MacArthur “Genius Grant” is Andrews’s latest in a long line of prestigious accomplishments. Shortly after becoming a tenured member of the Harvard faculty in 2018, the Economist named him one of the “the decade’s eight best young economists.” Andrews is also an associate editor of several prominent journals, including the American Economic Review and Econometrica; a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research; and a fellow of the Econometric Society.
“I think the field does recognize him as a superstar by all metrics,” MIT Economics professor Anna Mikusheva, Andrews’s Ph.D. dissertation adviser and long-time collaborator, said.
At the age of 34, Andrews is only starting his career.
Econometrics harnesses mathematics and statistical tools to develop and test economic models. Andrews said the subfield centers around complex mathematics but emphasized that his work is not theoretical.
“The value of econometrics derives from the importance of the underlying questions and the contribution to improving the quality of empirical work in economics,” Andrews said. “At the end of the day, I would like to do work that is useful.”
When beginning a project, Andrews starts by zeroing in on a problem empirical researchers face — for example, unreliable data inferences — and then narrowing the scope until he pinpoints a single question he can attempt to answer.
“The broad questions that I am largely interested in are questions of inference, trying to quantify our degree of uncertainty, our degree of confidence,” Andrews said. “How do we learn as much as we can from the data, but then also importantly, how do we quantify the limits of what we’re learning?”
After identifying a research question, Andrews then generates a conjecture. Once he has a set of plausible statements, he works with his co-authors to develop proofs and presents the material so it directly answers the original question. This is the process that he used to quantify and correct statistical uncertainty, most notably in weak identification and publication bias.
In its official announcement of Andrews’s fellowship, the MacArthur Foundation lauded the applicability of his work.
“Andrews demonstrates keen insight into how to address key statistical challenges in econometrics that are directly useful to empirical economists and have relevance to multiple fields,” the website announcement said.
Andrews’s colleagues point to his research process — tying all work back to a central motivating problem — as a cornerstone of his brilliance.
“What he’s done is brought a lot of sophisticated tactical machinery to answer and think about very different, relevant questions,” said Ashesh Rambachan, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate advised by Andrews.
Growing up in the Boston area — first in Wellesley, then in Brookline, Mass. — Andrews was surrounded by conversations about economics. His parents, Cheryl I. Smith and Marcellus Andrews, both hold doctorates in the subject.
Andrews’s father described his son in an email as “brilliant” but not bookish and “a fun kid with an easy laugh and a mischievous manner.” Yet a young Andrews was also exceedingly meticulous, a trait his father called a “need for intellectual and personal independence.”
Smith recalled how her son was inquisitive and had a long attention span.
“He would focus on something, and then he would just want to learn everything about it,” Smith said. “Every mother will tell you that their child is very, very special. But my child really was very special.”
Nobody in his family expected that Andrews would follow in his parents’ footsteps and pursue economics.
“[He] probably wanted to do anything but that,” Smith said.
But in college, Andrews discovered that economics might offer answers to his questions about the global economy. He received a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University in 2009, then went on to complete his Ph.D. in Economics at MIT in 2014.
“It was some guidance from ‘I think these are really important questions,’ and then a lot of just trying things out and continuing to do the ones that I was enjoying,” Andrews said.
While he enjoyed some advanced econometrics classes in college and took more of them in graduate school, Andrews’s first serious venture into econometrics happened almost by chance: in the spring of his first year at MIT, Andrews was randomly seated next to Mikusheva at a dinner. At the end of their conversation, Mikusheva — who would become Andrews’s future mentor and collaborator — offered him a research position.
What Andrews and Mikusheva explored in their first paper together in 2014 — and in a subsequent series of joint projects — became his first area of expertise: weak identification. Weak identification occurs when information is limited in scope, making economic models unreliable. Andrews and Mikusheva created methods that test and improve upon models when data distribution interferes with causal inferences.
Andrews established these new mathematical frameworks for weak identification through differential geometry and decision theory. Colleagues praised his creative perspective for the innovation it brought to the field.
“I would say that he and Anna, in two of their papers, opened up a completely different way to think about identification analysis for econometric models,” said Adam McCloskey, a University of Colorado at Boulder Economics professor and one of Andrews’s current collaborators. “That was kind of a breakthrough.”
Within traditional econometrics, Andrews also began working extensively on model misspecification in 2017, pioneering ways to best utilize models when their underlying assumptions might not align with the real world.
Some of Andrews’s groundbreaking work lies outside the field of economics, however. Last year, Andrews and University of Oxford Economics professor Maximilian Kasy published a paper in the American Economic Review on publication bias, a phenomenon in which research publication depends on the significance of effects detected in addition to quality. A potential research replication crisis in the life sciences prompted this work, which showed the sources and magnitude of the bias and offered ways to correct for it, according to Kasy.
Andrews is currently working on four papers, two of which have potentially wide-ranging applications outside of econometrics. The first is a paper with McCloskey and University College London Economics professor Toru Kitagawa entitled “Inference on Winners,” which scrutinizes data-driven policy selection when the same sets of data are used to determine the best treatments and the effects of those treatments. The second is a paper with Brown Economics professor Jesse M. Shapiro ’01 on a new model of scientific communication that increases research transparency and helps policymakers better utilize findings.
“One really special attribute of Isaiah is that his research is relatively technical within econometrics, but he’s always been interested in applications and other fields,” labor economist and former MIT classmate Conrad C. Miller said. “It’s always very easy to talk to him about my own work and find connections with his work, to look at different applications for applying new econometric methods.”
Beyond his research, Mikusheva and Kasy also noted Andrews’s important work in expanding diversity in economics. As a black and gay man, Andrews said that while he feels he has never been treated unfairly due to his identity, he is working to increase minority representation across the field of economics. He currently co-chairs the Harvard Economics Department’s Diversity and Inclusion Committee and will serve on the American Economic Association’s Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession starting in January 2021.
“He will keep working very hard, keep pushing economists to do better, keep trying to make it possible to provide useful answers to important public questions by making sure that econometrics gets things right,” Marcellus Andrews wrote.
Marcellus Andrews added that his son’s painstaking dedication to the field of econometrics stems from the belief that people’s lives are at stake.
“This passion for getting ‘it’ right is coupled with Isaiah’s very cool sense of analytical rigor: he insists that we all ‘sweat the details,’ so much so that he has absolutely no patience for sloppiness in thinking or writing,” he wrote.
McCloskey described Andrews as “exemplary in two dimensions”: his creativity and raw skill in econometrics on the one hand, his humility and compassion on the other.
“I haven’t really run into anyone with both that, sort of, ridiculous smarts and ridiculous amount of kindness simultaneously,” McCloskey said.
Many of Andrews’s colleagues echoed McCloskey’s words. In everyday conversations, said Daniel Barron — a Northwestern University Economics professor and former MIT classmate of Andrews — his brilliance comes through immediately.
“He’s just sharp, he’s there, he’s picking up on everything and making connections,” Barron said.
Kitagawa spoke to Andrews’s open-mindedness.
“He’s very eager to share the idea with the collaborators. And at the same, he also listens to our idea,” Kitagawa said. “Sometimes our idea doesn’t really work, but he’s very patient about that.”
Stanford Economics professor Matthew A. Gentzkow ’96 said Andrews is generous with his time. Gentzkow recalled that Andrews would spend hours writing pages of notes and feedback for a paper, even before being named a co-author.
A common sentiment among Andrews’s mentees, who are Ph.D. students at Harvard and MIT, is an appreciation for Andrews’s humility and relentless personal support.
“In a classroom, you thought he was just having a conversation with you, even though you know he knows very theoretical concepts so much more thoroughly than you do,” said Liyang Sun, Andrews’s mentee and a Ph.D. candidate at MIT. “He still articulates these concepts in a very accessible way that made me feel — as a learner — very encouraged."
Jonathan D. Roth, Andrews’s former mentee at Harvard, said he admires and tries to emulate Andrews’s ability to break down complicated concepts using simple explanations. Roth also said that when he was first preparing to enter the job market, Andrews stayed late past dark with him to practice interview questions and discuss strategy.
Rambachan remembered how Andrews looked out for him at one of his first conferences. When he was standing alone, Andrews introduced him to colleagues and invited him into conversations.
“He is simultaneously, easily, the smartest person I’ve ever met,” Rambachan said. “But at the same time, he is one of the kindest and most generous people that I get to interact with every single day.”

The COVID Collaborative — a coalition of experts in health, education, and the economy — launched a $50 million vaccine education campaign with nonprofit advertising group the Ad Council on Nov. 23. The effort aims to inform Americans about COVID-19 vaccines and their benefits.
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams co-founded the Collaborative alongside former Domestic Policy Council and USA Freedom Corps director John M. Bridgeland ’82 and current World Health Organization Ambassador for Global Strategy Roy G. Chambers. Chambers is a member of the School of Public Health Communication Advisory Board.
Several other Harvard faculty members serve on the National Advisory Council to the Collaborative, including University Professor Danielle S. Allen, University Professor Paul E. Farmer, Former University Provost Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, and School of Public Health Associate Dean Jay A. Winsten.
With promising announcements from three major phase-three COVID-19 vaccine trials, federal, state, and local officials are now grappling with the challenges of nationwide vaccine distribution and convincing citizens to get vaccinated.
A recent survey conducted by the COVID Collaborative found that while 86 percent of Americans believe a vaccine will effectively curb the virus, only one-third of survey takers say they will get vaccinated themselves.
Among Black and Latinx communities, confidence in a vaccine is much lower. Only 14 percent of Black Americans and 34 percent of Latin Americans indicated in another poll that they trust the vaccine.
The vaccine education campaign will focus on addressing the mistrust, relying on a “diverse advisory group” to craft culturally relevant and appropriate messaging for all Americans, according to a Nov. 23 press release from the Collaborative.
“Vaccine messages are not only informed by the best science, but by representatives of historically marginalized communities to make sure the messages will resonate,” the press release reads.
In an Oct. 29 press release, Williams emphasized the importance of reaching out to people of color and building trust around COVID-19 vaccines.
“The current political climate has caused Americans across party lines — but especially in communities of color — to fear that the vaccine will not be safe,” Williams stated in the press release. “It is the job of Governors and the public health community to rebuild that trust and to assure the American people, with facts and science, that the vaccine they receive will help protect themselves and their loved ones and help them get their lives back.”
In addition to the vaccine education campaign, the Collaborative and the Ad Council partnered with the Infectious Diseases Society of America to launch a mask-wearing communications toolkit for state governors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-eight College seniors became members of academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa’s Alpha Iota chapter on Nov. 16, joining twenty-four classmates who were elected to the society in April.
Phi Beta Kappa reserves membership for “those whose coursework demonstrates not only high achievement, but also breadth of interest, depth of understanding, and intellectual honesty,” per the website for Harvard’s group, which claims to be the oldest continuously operating chapter in the country.
The Harvard chapter will conduct one final round of nominations before Commencement, ensuring that no more than 10 percent of the graduating class receives the distinction. The election committee that selects students consists of University faculty and staff who are themselves members of the academic society.
Twenty of the seniors inducted into the society this cycle concentrate in the natural sciences; nineteen concentrate in the social sciences; and nine concentrate in the humanities. Of the 27 concentrations represented, Economics, Social Studies, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematics were the most popular concentrations, with four students from each.
Eleven of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses are represented in this selection round.
Phi Beta Kappa invited a select number of seniors with strong academic records to apply in October. After those seniors submitted letters of recommendation and their academic transcripts, the honor society notified inductees of their nomination by email.
Serin Baek ’21, a Chemical and Physical Biology concentrator, said the news of her nomination to the society lifted her spirits as she prepared to move out of her on-campus housing and was finishing lab work for her thesis.
“Finding out about it just made the week a lot better and definitely motivated me to get through with the week, get everything done, and make it back home safely,” Baek said.
Baek, who said she hails from Dothan, Ala., said her parents were unaware of the academic honor society.
“My parents are Korean immigrants, so they were not familiar with PBK,” Baek said. “I had to explain it to them a little bit, but they were definitely very proud and happy for me.”
History and Science concentrator Sydney N. Robinson ’21 said she was in class over Zoom when she found out she had been elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
“I think I muted myself and turned my mic off for three seconds and did a five-second dance party in my room,” Robinson said. “After, I went downstairs and told my friends and they were all really excited and gave me hugs. Then, later that night at dinner, one of them brought flowers to the house.”
Robinson said she felt validated by her election to the chapter.
“It really felt like I got an external affirmation of my experience at Harvard,” she said. “Even in a broader sense, affirming that I am able to be successful at a place like Harvard, that was a really wonderful feeling.”
Physics and Computer Science concentrator Maya Burhanpurkar ’21 said she felt “overjoyed” when she learned of her nomination to the society. Burhanpurkar said she was in the midst of working on her autonomous wheelchair company Adventus Robotics when she received the news.
“I was in the middle of testing our platform in simulation so I was actually quite distracted when I got the email,” Burhanpurkar said. “I had seen the notification on my phone, but I ignored it for a couple of hours.”
Burhanpurkar said she plans to return home to Canada after college and use her education to help her home country.
“I really hope that I can at some point come back to Canada and help contribute to the country, whether that’s trying to help better our public education system or public health care system,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council directed more than $38,000 in funding towards clubs in an emergency meeting Sunday.
The Council called the meeting in order to pass the legislation, which Council leadership wrote in an email it deemed was necessary in order for clubs to function. Normally the Council does not meet during the Thanksgiving break.
The Council considered two pieces of legislation sponsored by Eliot representative and Finance Committee Chair Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22. The legislation advocated for directing funds toward clubs that satisfied its requirements.
Some of these organizations included Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners, which was awarded more than $2,000 to purchase apparel that the club argues is “necessary for community.” Other clubs, such as the Harvard Women’s Wrestling Club and the Korean Association, requested funding to provide care packages for members. Still more used the funds to pay for banquets and retreats; the Harvard Technology Review received $200 for a board retreat. And a few clubs, including the Harvard College in Asia Program, utilized the funding to pay for website upkeep.
Overall, the two pieces of legislation put $38,277.69 into clubs’ hands. In an email to The Crimson, Ganesh wrote that the Council has spent close to half of its budget for the 2020-21 academic year.
“Clubs host activities crucial to the Harvard experience and therefore deserve to receive funding,” both pieces of legislation read.
The acts passed via unanimous vote.
The Council has funded numerous clubs and organizations at Harvard this year to support virtual programming while classes are online due to the ongoing pandemic. While the Council previously signaled it expected to receive less funding to distribute to clubs this year due to hordes of students waiving the Student Activities Fee — which, among other destinations, funds the Council — the Council has its usual allocation of $500,000 to spend on club funding and Council initiatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 10:15 p.m. on Sept. 14, Edwin “Eddie” B. Jin ’24 received a positive COVID-19 test result.
Because Harvard University Health Services does not operate at night, he didn’t hear anything more until 5:43 a.m. the following morning, when he received an email from FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke explaining how to move into isolation housing.
By the time an HUHS contact tracer called Jin at noon the next day, he had already talked to most people he had recently seen.
“For people who you’ve only known for two weeks, it's a pretty hard thing to tell someone,” Jin said. “Like, ‘I have COVID. You need to lock yourself inside your room for the next two weeks.’”
But Jin says his medical situation soon became less clear-cut.
After entering isolation at the Harvard Square Hotel on Sept. 15, Jin tested negative for COVID-19 twice. He has tested negative ever since.
For the more than 1,600 Harvard students who lived on campus this fall, regular testing became as much a part of their college routine as problem sets or club meetings. But nearly a dozen students interviewed by The Crimson said they often felt puzzled by the University’s testing and tracing infrastructure. Some said they did not know how to interpret contradictory test results; others were unsure whether and for how long they should isolate.
Students living on campus this semester dropped off self-administered tests three times a week at certain sites using kits designed by Color Genomics. The Broad Institute then processed the tests, allowing Color to notify students of their test results, often within a day. If an undergraduate tested positive, they would enter isolation — moving to a specific University-designated location. Their close contacts could quarantine in their rooms.
Jin and several others said much of their confusion stemmed from late or conflicting information they received from HUHS.
One month after he received his lone positive test, Jin tested negative for a COVID-19 antibody test — which identifies antibodies that an individual has produced in response to past infections — during a sports physical.
Six other students, all of whom received a positive test between Nov. 13 and Nov. 16, reported similar uncertainty. After returning no positive results during October, undergraduates experienced a spike in positive tests during the middle of November.
After receiving a positive test result on Nov. 15, Eric Yan ’24 checked into the Hotel at around 12:30 p.m. A nurse visited his room over the next two days to pick up two self-administered COVID-19 tests. Both came back negative the following day.
Yan said he wondered whether the negative results might change the length of time Harvard would require him to isolate. HUHS told him to expect a call on Nov. 18.
Eventually, HUHS Patient Advocate Mallory Finne told Yan on Nov. 19 via email that he had to remain at the hotel until the end of the 10-day isolation period despite subsequent negative test results, he said.
Several students said that they initially heard they could leave if their first two tests in isolation came back negative. On Nov. 18, however, the Massachusetts’ Department of Public Health revised isolation and quarantine policies for higher education institutions. Students who tested positive for COVID-19 isolating in campus housing “should remain in place until completing the 10-day isolation period, as prescribed by DPH guidance,” the announcement said on Nov. 18, when Finne contacted Yan. Yard proctors emailed summaries of the new developments to students later that day.
Though HUHS notified Yan on Wednesday of the 10-day isolation period, he received another call on Nov. 19 from HUHS informing him he and his close contacts should expect an email extending the isolation and quarantine period to 14 days.
“This is an email that neither myself nor any of my contacts ever got,” Yan said.
Other students in isolation, several of whom The Crimson granted anonymity to discuss confidential medical information, also said they received conflicting or confusing information.
One student, who had tested positive on Nov. 16, said she had to reschedule her flight home twice, costing her an extra $500. While most students in isolation received tests the first two days at the hotel, she said she received only one test without an explanation of the change in state guidelines.
One student who self-reported a positive test on Crimson Clear said HUHS contacted them with instructions for isolating only about ten hours after they received the result. Although they stayed inside, they could have gone out and infected other people, they said. They also said that they felt confused and did not receive any communication about why they did not continue to receive tests in isolation.
Another undergraduate said she received a call at 9 p.m. on Nov. 16 after receiving a positive test. The caller told her HUHS would follow up shortly, but at 1 a.m. she went to sleep after hearing nothing.
The next day, she said she texted her HUHS contact and got an email with instructions for isolating only after her text around 1 p.m.
Yan and Jin both said they found getting consistent information from HUHS challenging.
“It was not easy to get information,” Yan said. “Also, there was definitely some inconsistent information, which was kind of stressful when you're in isolation.”
Jin also described the difficulty of moving to the Harvard Square Hotel and dealing with the uncertain implications of his positive test result as he juggled his normal responsibilities.
“Throughout this entire time, I had to deal with my academic courses. There was no break and I was involved in other extracurriculars that were pretty demanding at the time,” Jin said. “It's a huge disruption, you want to take the time for yourself, but at the same time, you can't because there's so much else swirling around. And that's just the essence of COVID generally I think.”
Asked about students’ frustrations with HUHS, Senior Communications Officer Michael Perry referred to a previous comment provided to the Crimson.
“As always, HUHS operates under the guidance and regulations of local public health officials to keep Harvard and our communities safe,” HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an emailed statement. “As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, guidance can evolve and change rapidly. We understand that some students have been frustrated with isolation and quarantine protocols recently.”
Yan said that he had to ask Finne, the patient advocate, about how to interpret potentially false results, who responded via email explaining that he shouldn’t test for the next 90 days. The CDC states that if an individual who tested positive for a COVID-19 PCR test remains asymptomatic for 90 days after symptom onset, re-testing is “unlikely to yield useful information.”
“What I was basically told was that the negative test results do not mean that the positive test was false,” Yan said. “That is just because this virus takes a different course in every patient. It could just be on the day at the time that you took the test, the virus did not appear in your nasal passages.”
But Sarah Fortune — Chair of Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases and Associate Member of the Broad Institute — explained that low COVID-19 rates at Harvard make false positives more likely.
“The prevalence of COVID is relatively low at Harvard and therefore — even though the COVID PCR test has excellent performance characteristics — there will be more false positives for every true positive than there would be in a population with a higher prevalence of infection,” Fortune said in an emailed statement. “The strategy of frequent testing of a relatively low prevalence population implicitly accepts the downside of some false positives as the cost of stringent COVID containment.”
Jin said he understood the College has dealt with unprecedented challenges during the pandemic, but that he hopes student feedback can inform future improvements.
“I'm fully cognizant of the fact that it's not easy to prepare for the global pandemic in a couple of months and do all that the Harvard administration is doing,” Jin said. “I commend Harvard for all that they're doing, but there's still room to improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the sixteen years Gregory A. Llacer worked alongside Robert A. Lue, Llacer never knew Lue to be anything less than “an indefatigable advocate for science education,” “a blue-sky thinker,” and “a tireless humanist.”
“Rob was one of the first Harvard faculty members I got to know,” Llacer wrote in a Nov. 12 email to his staff at the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, which he directs. “Even in the throes of declining health due to cancer he was fighting throughout the summer, we still were working on ideas and projects, collaborations I intend to see through.”
Lue, an innovator in life sciences education, died on Nov. 11 at 56 of a fast-moving cancer.
Lue’s footprint at Harvard stretches wide. In addition to his role as a Molecular and Cellular Biology professor of practice, he served as founding faculty director of Harvard’s online education platform, HarvardX; the first faculty director of the Harvard Ed Portal, a educational program for Allston and Brighton residents; faculty director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning; UNESCO Chair on Life Sciences and Social Innovation; and faculty director and principal investigator of LabXchange, an online science education platform.
Faculty and administrators from across the University said Lue left an indelible mark wherever he went. He fought relentlessly to ensure that all students could access a high-quality education, whether they were at Harvard or not. He saw no limits to where a Harvard education should — and could — be accessed.
Lue, born in 1964, grew up in Jamaica and graduated from St. George’s College in Kingston in 1982. He then attended the College of the Holy Cross, graduating with a degree in biology and philosophy in 1986. After his undergraduate years, Lue spent a year at Brandeis University to focus on painting. He finally found his way to Harvard for a Ph.D. in MCB in the lab of Daniel Branton.
Branton, now an emeritus faculty member in MCB, said he saw a glimpse of Lue’s future in teaching during his early years at Harvard as he assisted Branton in cell biology courses.
“He really got more interested in teaching, as time went on, than in detailed lab benchwork,” Branton said, noting that Lue always received “the highest marks of any of the teaching fellows.”
In addition to sparking an interest in teaching, Branton’s lab also connected Lue to his partner for the next 30 years, Alain Viel, now a senior lecturer in MCB and director of Northwest Labs.
Within four years of receiving his Ph.D., Lue became an MCB faculty member at Harvard, where he quickly made a mark on students.
Juliet R. Girard ’07, one of Lue’s students and advisees, said Lue helped her obtain a new computer her freshman year when her old laptop from high school broke down and she could not afford to purchase a new one.
“He was so shocked at first, ‘Oh, you don’t have a computer? You should have told me!’” Girard said. “He wasn’t shocked as to how I could not have a computer, but more so he was sorry that I had this problem and he hadn’t known to fix it.”
Within a week, Lue had secured the funding for Girard’s new computer.
“He was not just the person who talked about wanting to help people, but he actually did help students who didn’t have people supporting them,” Girard said. “He just fixed the problem, and I had never had someone who had immediately recognized what I was going through and immediately wanted to help and made it happen so fast.”
Lue’s undergraduates said they quickly picked up on his compassion for students and resourcefulness to ensure students received a high-quality education, regardless of their circumstances.
Suuba M. Demby ’22 and Sophia E. Swartz ’22, two students who took Molecular and Cellular Biology 64: “Cell Biology in the World” with Lue in the spring, both said Lue seamlessly navigated the switch to online instruction when classes went remote due to the coronavirus pandemic mid-March.
“When people were speculating whether we were going remote or not, he was always offering solutions and comfort to students who were apprehensive about what was to come,” Demby said. “And once the course transitioned online, I was amazed at how well the course was structured, such as with incorporating LabXchange — it was perhaps one of the best-adapted courses last spring.”
Swartz added that Lue integrated storytelling into his teaching, such as narratives from HIV patients, to help students recognize the societal impact of science on individuals who may not have been able to access the science themselves.
“He was focusing not just on educating students, but on how to train future doctors and researchers to do science to improve the human condition and minimize human suffering,” Swartz said.
The impacts of Lue’s teaching extended beyond his students, also shaping the work of his fellow faculty members. Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Chair Elena M. Kramer said Lue opened her eyes to how to become “a much more intentional educator, instead of working on instincts.”
“Like much of the faculty of my generation, I did not receive any formal training in pedagogy,” Kramer said. “They just threw us into the classroom and expected us to figure it out, so Rob really showed me how to be much more conscious about what I did in teaching.”
Bok Center Executive Director Tamara J. Brenner wrote in an email that Lue “dramatically expanded the breadth and scope of the Bok Center’s work,” leading to hundreds of faculty and more than 1,000 undergraduate students engaging with the center annually to improve course design and pursue novel modes of learning.
“Rob believed in the power of an intergenerational community, where faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates work together as partners, sharing their perspectives to improve education,” Brenner wrote.
In addition to his scientific and pedagogical pursuits, Lue was particularly fond of art.
The passion was combined with his eye for innovative science education when he and Viel developed “The Inner Life of the Cell” in 2006. Viewed by millions of students worldwide, the animated video depicts the biological processes within a white blood cell responding to inflammation in the body. It was the first of many multimedia projects undertaken by Lue as part of the BioVisions initiative he founded at Harvard.
Viel said that while he and Lue would often work on projects together at Harvard, whether with BioVisions or the Harvard Summer School, the two would not discuss work at home. They instead turned to subjects of mutual interest, such as art, cinema, and coffee.
“What was compelling was his intellect, and how broad-ranging his interests were,” Viel said. “Back when we were in Dan Branton’s lab, we would talk about a wide range of topics, and that is what really attracted me to him, because I thought it was amazing you could talk to him about anything, and not just why your lab experiments failed or succeeded.”
“He was very information-driven,” Viel added. “For example, when we had our study abroad program in Paris, we would stay in an Airbnb, and he would know which part of Paris he wanted to stay and he would do a full analysis of all the possible Airbnbs that are available before making a decision where to stay.”
Jonathan R. Hamilton ’20, who attended the study abroad program in Paris, called “The Biopolis,” said Lue’s Airbnb was always filled with vibrant colors — which Lue had an affinity for.
“Even his outfits were really colorful,” Hamilton said. “I remember this one outfit he had was a pair of lighter-blue pants and these big bulky sneakers with a green and yellow jacket and a baseball hat.”
The brightness and energy extended to his teaching style, which always captured his students’ attention, said MCB Professor Richard M. Losick. Together, he and Lue pioneered Life Sciences 1A: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cellular Biology,” the first course of its kind at Harvard to integrate biology and chemistry for first-year students. The two co-taught the course for several years.
“To witness him lecture to the class was something to behold,” Losick said. “He had this engaging voice, it was almost operatic. When students went into the classroom, he would show videos from movies, like Star Wars, and then all of a sudden there would be this big explosion and he would say ‘Welcome to LS1a.’”
“When Rob lectured, you could hear a pin drop as he enthralled the freshmen with his ability to engage them in the topic of the day; they hung on his every word,” Losick added.

Sure, the semester is online, but that didn’t stop sophomores from having to declare their concentrations mid-November. Picking what to study can range from easy-as-Thanksgiving-pie to difficult-difficult-lemon-difficult, so here’s some perspective from folks at Flyby who decided they wanted to be part of the two most popular concentrations at Harvard.
Computer Science (MBB): Janani Sekar
I just declared CS (Mind, Brain, Behavior). I never thought I'd end up studying CS and didn't even like it that much in high school. But it's honestly grown on me over the last year and a half, and I'm feeling really good about my decision. Although I probably won't be an engineer, I am pretty undecided about what I want to do with my life after graduation. Regardless, I feel like I'm learning a lot of *useful skillz* as a CS concentrator while exploring different types of classes and also understanding how applicable technology is to everything (cliched but true don't deny it!!).
To be fair, in the future, there's going to be a lot of late-night psetting, scary classes, and angry feelings when I can't get something to work. But we're in it for the long haul because the satisfaction of solving a problem definitely makes it all worth it. I guess this is all to say I never saw myself as a "STEM" or "CS" person, but things really can change, and I'm glad I chose to explore CS classes a bit and change my mind. I'm all about that #balance though and look forward to taking a lot of classes in the social sciences too. The only thing I'm slightly bummed about is not getting all that free department swag after declaring. Oh well.
Economics: Nicole T. Rozelman
When I came to Harvard, I knew that as long as David Laibson didn’t assign six midterms and a hundred textbook chapters, and then proceed to throw said textbook at me, I would be concentrating in Economics. I spent my first year (¾ year) on campus shopping classes from the History department, talking to Psych concentration advisors, and even chatting with my fearless AM friends, but I always knew in the back of my mind that Economics was the most direct catch-all for my academic interests.
I enjoy the interplay of analytical and quantitative thinking that is at the core of the discipline, and I also appreciate the incredible range of Harvard Economics courses that tackle issues from healthcare to sports. This economic framework has truly come to enhance the way I engage with the world, helping me balance zoomed-in analysis with high-level understanding. I’ve also found myself in quite a few dhall debates where the data-driven studies we look at in class have come in clutch in keeping those holier-than-thou Gov kids at bay.
Plus, a lot of the concepts that we cover in class, such as the time value of money and fiscal policy within a macro context, are relevant to the work I want to do in the future. Even though I’ll have to wait for that obligatory IB internship to learn most of my Excel and modeling skills, the Economics community is a great space to connect with and receive mentorship from similarly interested and driven students.
