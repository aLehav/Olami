After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Iceage are missing a space in their name, but the Danish band’s particular brand of punk rock thrives on a lack of space to breathe. The words “ice age,” although denotative of a frozen eon, here suggest an unavoidably stark honesty that lead vocalist Elias Rønnenfelt can’t seem to express with enough urgency. As such, it is a desperate fury that drives Iceage’s latest release, “You’re Nothing,” which follows their debut as another electrifying tribute to punk rock that maintains a sense of vehemence and earnestness while still showcasing the group’s talent.
With the exception of “Interlude,” all the tracks on “You’re Nothing” seem to rush forward in a race against time—the album is a continuous journey through Rønnenfelt’s troubled mind, which always seems to have more to say than the short tracks allow. “Pressure, pressure, oh, God, no!” Rønnenfelt pleads in “Ecstasy,” the frantic cry of a young man overwhelmed by the sheer volume of what he has to say.
This sense of frenetic immediacy is often dictated by drummer Dan Nielsen, whose complex snare rhythms and fiery fills act as the album’s propane. Especially on short, energetic tracks like “Rodfæstet,” Nielsen’s commanding pulse gives velocity and backbone to the sound. This irrepressible forward momentum is counterbalanced by the lack of a real thematic arrival. The band seems to search frantically but unsuccessfully for a way to explain itself—either lyrically or melodically—in the little time that it has. By the time Iceage reaches the penultimate “Awake,” Rønnenfelt sounds almost defeated as he declares, “We’re running out of time.”
Although it is difficult to discern the impetus for the album’s rushed feel, the lyricism reveals that “You’re Nothing” is first and foremost a work of personal frustration. “Morals” opens with the introspective lines, “These songs, they never reach far enough / These shoulders never strike wide enough.” This feeling of inadequacy originates in the album’s aggressively dejected title and manifests itself throughout the album in plaintive vocals and searching lyrics. “It all comes down to shame / And any sense of distance,” Rønnenfelt cries on “Wounded Hearts,” sounding disappointed in himself and his lack of self-worth. By the time he shouts, “That’s why you’re nothing” on the title track, which concludes the album, the line sounds unmistakably like a self-accusation.
Imperfections on the album contribute, rather than detract, from Iceage’s earnest sound. In fact, much of the appeal of “You’re Nothing” lies in these captivatingly human elements, a nod towards the traditional “do-it-yourself” nature of punk rock albums. Rønnenfelt’s shouts aren’t always perfectly on pitch, even for shouts, and the timing at the end of “Morals” between the guitar and the snare drum phases in and out of sync. Instead of devaluing the album, these small defects make “You’re Nothing” a uniquely approachable addition to the genre.
But what sets Iceage’s newest release apart from many other punk rock albums is the truly exceptional musical talent that lies under the aggressive layer of punk fury and musical imperfections. The full-frontal guitar attack is tasteful and at times intricate, such as on “Burning Hand,” when an almost imperceptible guitar line ornaments the traditional sea of distorted sound. At other times, these guitar lines are inexplicably catchy, creating a surprising pop feel on “Wounded Hearts” and “Awake.” Throughout the album, Rønnenfelt also demonstrates his vocal versatility, sounding sweet and warm on “Morals” and then uncontrollably vicious on “It Might Hit First.” Although the vocals never lose their edge, a tinge of wistfulness creeps in at all the right moments, coloring the vocals’ timbre in a way that provides an emotive depth to the album.
Much to their credit, Iceage have managed to maintain their devastatingly aggressive sound while writing some of the most compelling and fresh music to come out of the genre in decades. The resultant “You’re Nothing,” although produced in high fidelity and teeming with talent, is not just a record for punk rock fans—it’s a record for punk rock. It may be too early to call Iceage the band that will revive punk, but their aptitude doesn’t get in the way of the elements that make their latest release an homage to the genre that Tommy Ramone called “pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock ‘n’ roll.”

“Gravediggress”
CocoRosie, “Tales of a Grass Widow”
The Casady sisters, who perform as CocoRosie, defy any definition or genre. Since they released “La maison de mon reve” in 2004, they have been steadily tuning their experimental sound, relying on a range of eclectic tools that includes a harp and toy instruments. A nostalgic accordion refrain opens their new single, “Gravediggress,” creating a singsong melody which is complicated by an electronic rhythm and beatboxing. Into this mix, the sisters introduce their elusive vocals, mingling Bianca’s angelic solo and Sierra’s throaty interjections to create the unsettling effect that distinguishes CocoRosie as a phenomenal and unique band. “Gravediggeress” is an amorphous, enticing and otherworldly tune that marks the start of a challenging wait for CocoRosie fans until the release of the group’s album in May.
“Retrograde”
James Blake, “Overgrown”
On “Retrograde,” singer-songwriter James Blake’s yearning voice captures a sense of desperate loneliness as it emerges into an atmosphere of disconnected sounds. The deliberate intonation with which Blake utters each falsetto phrase constructs layers of sound that build in intensity until the breaking point before the last minute of the song. He then begins his signature Blake-ian humming, proving his aptitude as a vocalist and demonstrating that he cannot be pigeonholed in the genre of electronic music—he uses his voice too aptly and consciously for that. The vocal loops create an orchestra of multiple Blakes that compound the emotional impact of his lyricism as he croons, “We’re alone now,” and challenges the listener, “So show me where you fit.” “Retrograde” proves that James Blake is coming back to shake the electronic music world and keep redefining its limits and boundaries.  
 “Earthquake” 
The Uncluded, “Hokey Fright”
Kimya Dawson and Aesop Rock’s newly released track “Earthquake,” off their collaborative album “Hokey Fright,” is repetitive and verbose even as it maintains its cutting wit. The playful tone of Dawson’s lyricism is juxtaposed with Aesop’s penchant for aggressive spoken word. The repeating arpeggio of the guitar sets the loping pace of the song. However, Dawson and Aesop’s collaboration is by and large ineffective—when they sing together, their voices create a cancelling effect that prevents the listener from absorbing more than one vocal line each listen. The listener has to either tune in to Aesop and ignore Kimya, or vice versa. Textural chaos and simplistic musical stylings mark the song as quirky and original, but “Earthquake” doesn’t present anything truly satisfying.

An unreliable narrator-cum-émigré writes his confession to a jury about why he kidnapped his young daughter and drove her through America. The pair shack up in hotel rooms, the older man lumbering paranoid through days, fearing he will be forced to give up the light of his life. However, his daughter is not also the fire of his loins, and therein lies the obvious difference between “Schroder: A Novel,” by Amity Gaige, and its instinctual comparison work, Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita.” Thankfully, it is not just the lack of sexual obsession that differentiates the two; no, with playful rejection of Nabokov’s style and a focus on the even more seductive concept of assimilation, “Schroder” succeeds despite Gaige’s refusal to remain slave to the Nabokovian verve that endeared so many to “Lolita.”
The titular character reinvents himself from East German immigrant Erik Schroder to American all-star Eric Kennedy—slyly insinuating familial ties to the Kennedys by claiming he grew up in the fictional Twelve Hills, “a stone’s throw from Hyannis Port.” In describing his fascination with all things American, Erik writes: “At first I’d feel a pop of childish wonder, but this wonder was followed by the urge to stuff it back, because if I were a real American I would not have been in the least impressed with any of it.” With this opening salvo, Gaige refuses to fetishize a foreigner’s experience and the English language as Nabokov does in “Lolita” and “Pnin,” lending even more legitimacy to the narration’s plain style.
After decades as Eric Kennedy, Schroder’s marriage collapses and he is relegated to a satellite position in his daughter Meadow’s life so that his identity theft won’t be revealed. Throughout his fear runs a difficulty in remembering that his constructed life as Kennedy is a lie, as in lines such as “For a moment the groom believed...that there actually was such a place as Twelve Hills.” This delusion is subtly contrasted with his father’s halting German advice to Schroder that informs his decision to kidnap his daughter, which Schroder helpfully translates roughly as “I can definitely stuff my daughter in my trunk as I attempt to cross the Canadian border” instead of as poignant commentary on the Berlin Wall, as it was meant. The type of self-delusion that is taking place is clear, but since the narrator himself is not completely aware of it, it comes across as more convincing.
And here is where Gaige subtly concocts an anti-heroic Eric Kennedy who can never admit he is wrong and a guilt-torn, honest Schroder who fills up a page with “I let you down” repeated like Catholic school punishment lines. There are the blatant similarities to Humbert Humbert, but each parallel scene is qualified. Schroder meets his wife in a park, as opposed to Humbert on a park bench lusting over girls a third of his age. Both emotionally manipulate older women—the surprisingly well-developed April Almond in “Schroder,” who criticizes Schroder and the purposely undeveloped Charlotte Haze in “Lolita,” who merely fawns. This more honest, straightforward approach to a liar is well-made and appropriate given that the his grossest prevarication was solely about his nationality—a more sympathetic, less icky lie. The coup of the the book is reached when Schroder realizes that he is transferring his own insecurity about his identity upon his daughter, a conclusion that feels true and belated, yet is appreciated.
Another difference is that Gaige’s language is not frilly and suffocatingly allusive, and it instead flits between different types of language exercises that prevent the novel as a whole from becoming nauseatingly navel-gazing. Schroder inserts a humorous snippet of a play that he’s written about offering his wife a snack: “How about a pretzel? A fruitcake? Lamb with mint jelly? WHY IS EVERYTHING I OFFER YOU INSUFFICIENT?” Gaige also inserts snatches of German from Schroder’s past and pauses the narration in just the right moments to signpost upon which parts it is worth dwelling.
Gaige generally takes risks with these various writing exercises, and with the choice to organize the book into a short-chapter format, she creates a many-parted machine that does not become fractured given Schroder’s frequently all-consuming delusion that he is indeed Eric Kennedy. The direct allusions to Nabokov—Meadow wants to become a lepidopterist, a hobby of Nabokov; a nice complicator when a bartender on their road trip tells Meadow that “You shouldn’t trust anyone over the age of twelve. After twelve, it’s lies, lies, lies”—are similarly fractured and don’t constitute major themes in the story, but also don’t deny the book’s identity. With more allusions, the prose would become needlessly stilted; with fewer, it would sound ungrateful.
Admittedly, it is instinctual to comment about the differences and similarities between “Schroder” and “Lolita”—and furthermore, it’s a daunting task to break out of Nabokov’s imprisoning enchantment. But do not misunderstand. Gaige succeeds in making Schroder’s life story, of his father also “kidnapping” him away to America, not seem an illegitimate excuse for his crime, like the teenaged Humbert Humbert’s truncated love of Anabel Lee.
Adding a believable sense of shame, Gaige creates an endearing protagonist not only defined by his willingness to “tell the truth” in a statement to a jury. What makes Schroder alive is his vivid fear of actually admitting that he has a breach in his own identity much larger than the hole in the Berlin Wall through which he and his father cautiously slipped. Schroder’s apology seems sincere, and a crisis of identity can finally be identified and spoken about 50 years later instead transferred upon a 12-year-old girl. And thus, we have an unreliable narrator who transcends the haze of his crime.

If I could go back in time, I would return to any moment before I read Jane Austen’s “Persuasion.” Then, I’d have the entire novel ahead of me, patiently waiting just like central character Anne Elliot herself. If Anne could wait for her Captain Wentworth forever, “Persuasion” should wait for me forever. I’d want to save the pleasures of this particular Austen novel for the last moments of my life, rather than consuming it ravenously as I did at age 13.
“Persuasion” was the last novel Austen wrote and was published after her death in 1817. It’s a painful tale of uncertain love; when Anne is young, she’s persuaded by her vain father and snobby Lady Russell to deny Captain Wentworth’s marriage proposal. Predictably—because this is early 19th-century England—Wentworth takes to the seas to drown his sorrows in the Navy. Eight years later Anne finds herself, at the ungodly age of 27, alone after having refused to fall in love with anyone else. Naturally, in the context of Jane Austen’s world, you’d expect the ending of “Persuasion” to be a second—and this time accepted—proposal from Wentworth, and that conclusion does indeed come. However, the novel is so submerged in Anne’s self-deprecating mind that it’s possible to forget the book is ultimately a Jane Austen creation. It is so submerged in Anne’s voice, which is both serious and eager that the tone of the novel strays noticeably from Austen’s other, more conversational novels. That is what separates “Persuasion” from from others such as “Emma” or “Pride and Prejudice.” This particular Austen is quieter, and it unravels at a patient, almost leisurely pace.
The only place to read “Persuasion” is in a beanbag chair because sinking into an armchair is not quite as satisfying as the undulating, expansive nature of the beanbag. Submerged in the indented chair and in Anne Elliot’s mind, you forget that there’s a happy ending after all the insufferable evenings spent in parlor rooms. Austen is a master of discomforting her characters; her novels are a precursor to the visceral social awkwardness in the film “Bridesmaids.” Austen has a talent for seizing an uncomfortable situation, placing just the right number of characters in the room, and watching her protagonists squirm like worms on the sidewalk.  It’s the penetrating particularity of the phrases Austen chooses that cause us to sink deeper into the beanbag, confessions like “You pierce my soul” and “I am half agony, and half hope” and the nearly unspeakably true, “When pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.” Austen digs underneath our sense of decency, mucking up social formalities 200 years before my unbelievably awkward self ever entered the scene.
Austen’s ability to articulate exactly the workings of Anne’s self-doubt is incredible; the text is not even written in the first person, and yet it is undoubtedly written from her perspective alone. In reading “Persuasion,” I felt a comforting interiority I had not sensed as much in her other novels. And Austen goes farther; she draws out the Anne’s uncertainty until the penultimate chapter. Even then, it is only an accidentally overheard conversation that prompts Wentworth to confess his steadfast love.
I have never experienced so much physical relief and confusing joy while reading any other novel. I believe I sank below the outer edges of my beanbag chair when I read Wentworth’s confession; my feet were likely sticking above my head by the end of it all. I experienced many of the same emotions that Anne herself probably battled with after reading Wentworth’s letter. “I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach.” I was irrationally surprised, as if all the time I’d spent in the beanbag chair was actually time spent in Somersetshire and Bath; it had felt like eight years of waiting, and finally Anne and I were being rewarded by this love letter. I felt like a martyr.
So here is my logical proposition: wait until you are weeks from the end of your life, when you are wrinkled and your bones are more brittle than the pages of “Persuasion.” Only then should you pick up Austen’s last, and in my opinion, greatest novel. Then, having literally waited all of your life for this moment, when Chapter 23 comes around and Anne happens upon the letter, the carefully concocted feeling of liberation will be limitless.

“New Blue and White,” a new exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, centers around blue and white porcelain, which was first created in 7th-century China, and remains today an iconic and familiar style. A new exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts highlights contemporary artists’ attempt to make this classic art form relevant and surprising in the 21st century. On view through July 14, the show comprises nearly 70 contemporary pieces of porcelain by over 40 artists. Blue and white is a term used in the Asian art field to describe a specific type of porcelain of cobalt-blue decoration painted under a clear gaze. There was much creative and artistic back-and-forth between ancient China and the Islamic world, which had access to extensive reserves of cobalt. Local potters in the Middle East learned how to emulate the styles of pottery that were being imported from China. The Mongolian invasion of the 13th century reinforced an aesthetic shift toward more ornamental blue and white style pottery. By the 14th century, the Chinese had perfected blue and white porcelain and started to mass produce it. Dutch Delftware and German Meissen ware represent later attempts to recreate Chinese porcelain.
 “Globalization is not entirely new, when you think about the way the blue and white travels,” says Emily Zilber, the MFA’s Ronald L. and Anita C. Wornick Curator of Contemporary Decorative Arts, who arranged this exhibition. “We certainly associate it with Asian ceramics, but blue and white has touched almost everybody around the globe.”
 This exhibition that deals with blue and white in an encyclopedic context—by linking works to other historically and artistically related works in the museum—rather than a straightforward gallery layout.  For example, there are seven artworks in the exhibition with labels leading visitors to related historical works in other parts of the MFA, artworks such as John Singer Sargent’s signature painting, “The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit,” which is a domestic scene framed by two Japanese blue and white vases. Kondô Takahiro one of the artists whose modern porcelain is on display, has created a contemporary vase that is a twist on a traditional vase that was created by Takahiro’s grandfather. Other artists’ pieces make statements about cultural exchange. “Prayer Stone II,” by Iranian artist Pouran Jinchi, applies of layers of lacquer on Shiite Muslim prayer stones that were brought from Iran by her brother and mother, representing and at the same time re-interpreting her cultural roots.
For Dutch artist Gèsene Hackerberg, the use of blue and white porcelain is a way to rethink the Dutch tradition of delftware. Hackenberg has created a necklace out of delft platters. “Delft blue ware is very valuable here, but it’s also a national pride of the Dutch,” Hackenberg says. By upcycling the traditional Delft blue, “[Hackenberg has] simultaneously destroyed the platter because it is not functional as a platter anymore, but also allowed it to be a part of a new still life,” Zilber says.
Some artists take the familiarity of blue and white objects and imbue broader meanings into them. Michelle Erickson, who is also currently a visiting artist at Harvard, took  inspiration from an 18th-century American porcelain pickle stand and creatively replicated it in a 21st-century style. “The original pickle stand was made by the first American forge. Porcelain in general was being produced in Europe at this point, so this pickle stand symbolizes the beginning of American independence,”  Erickson says. On top of this historical significance, Erickson has added motifs of conflict such as a broken grenade and gas nozzle, which represent the artifacts of the modern era. “As we are navigating the contemporary world, it’s always important to think about the past and how it impacts our actions, and realize [the] longer trajectory,” Zilber says, “This is an exhibition that speaks very particularly to that that productive tension between the past and the present.”

“Performer with Cirque Du Soleil” is a rare credit to see on most resumes, but for Jon L. Morris, it is just one of many jobs he has taken on over his eclectic and extensive performance career. Morris has done everything from acting in a short film featured at the Sundance festival to performing in the Tony Award-winning company Theatre de la Jeune Lune to touring with the internationally acclaimed show “Fuerza Bruta.”
Recently, he started his own performance collective, The Windmill Factory, and was awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study movement theater with Philippe Gaulier, a famous French clown and professor of theater. On Thursday, Morris will teach a master class on the basics of physical theater at the Harvard Dance Center. No dance or performance experience is required; Morris recommends that students dress to move, be ready to have a great time, and “check their Veritas at the door.“
The Harvard Crimson: What kind of performances do you create with the Windmill Factory?
Jon L. Morris: We just did a 15-minute shadow play on the side of a castle wall in Cartagena, Colombia, for a one-night, 500-person dinner. The shadow play…was on this massive castle with a wall that was 60 feet by 300 feet. We had massive projectors and moving lights…. We also had some of the best acrobats I had ever worked with on that show. Just the slightest adjustments of their bodies made the difference between seeing a frog at 60 feet or just a blob. Another wild one we did on a totally different medium was recreating the night sky on the Hudson River with solar-powered, wirelessly controlled LED lights in a piece called “Reflecting the Stars”…. So you could push a button and the Big Dipper would appear out on the water. It was raising awareness about light pollution
within our city…. Both [these examples] have this element of humanity and connectivity to the audience, and that’s the key for us. If we’re going to create an installation, people are going to be able to play with it and interact with it. If we’re going do a theater piece, we’re going to be in the audience and playing with the people.
THC: What will your collaborative performance and movement theater master class be like?
JLM: The master class that I will be teaching next week is derived from various styles of theater that I have performed in and trained in all over the world, and that’s all the way from dance and Indian dance to traditions of clowning and Stanislavski acting technique to circus and athletics…. The biggest thing in the style of theater that I am most passionate about and will work with in my master class is that it is extremely connected emotionally with very motivated movements. It is never an abstract language. There is always a purpose to it. Even if the gesture is repeating in reverse five times and not necessarily something you would see everyday, it remains motivated in a way that connects to the story and helps tell the story. It has a purpose, and in that way all the gestures in a piece connect to the storyline and help push the piece along.
THC: What has your experience been like with the show Fuerza Bruta?
JLM: I came on as part of the original cast in New York City…. I toured to Taiwan, Brazil, [and] Israel. If someone asked me what the show was about, I’d just say, “Just come and see it,” and I’d try to give them as little information as possible. But if they insisted, I’d tell them it is an incredible theatrical experience that combines dance, theater, spectacle, and a party all in the same show.
THC: How should audiences approach a show as avant-garde as Fuerza Bruta?
JLM: One of the unique things about Fuerza Bruta is that Diqui James, the [show’s artistic director and] creator, really creates such beautiful, poetic images that are like moving paintings, and they have enough character and storyline for people to latch on to, but not enough to have one interpretation. In the four years that I was in Fuerza Bruta I must have heard thousands of interpretations of what different moments, or different characters, or what the whole thing meant. And that’s really the show’s greatest strength. So when people would ask me, “What does it mean?” I’d always return the question and ask, “What do you think it means?” and I’d almost always get a different answer.

On March 5, Memorial Church's organ recital series continues with a free and open to the public celebrity performance by acclaimed organist Nathan Laube, artist-in-residence at the American Cathedral in Paris. Having spent the past several years studying and performing in France and Germany, Laube embraces the new challenge brought by performing in an American colonial church. “What's so fascinating is coming to a new place where all of these foreign variables have been introduced,” he says. “Memorial Church is not a big French cathedral, a chamber music hall, or a little court with royalty adorning the sides of the building.... We have to really reinvent the music in a new space and within a new context.”
 The performance is part of a series inaugurating the pair of new organs Memorial Church acquired past two years. “I've spent hours and hours thinking about what to play in this venue and on these two organs,” Laube says. He has chosen pieces to fit the distinct personalities of Memorial Church's two instruments, he says.
 On the smaller, 1929 Skinner organ he will play German neoclassical composer Paul Hindemith's first organ sonata, written less than a decade after the instrument was built. “[The piece ] will give us an opportunity to hear all the subtle details, special effects, and little decadent colors you get with an organ that aspires to be more of a symphony orchestra than a classical pipe organ,” Laube says.
 For the newer Fisk organ he has selected a more eclectic program—Bach, Duruflé, and Mozart, among others—designed to showcase the instrument's tonal flexibility. “[The Fisk] allows you a greater degree of authenticity in terms of entering many different sound worlds within the context of one instrument,” Laube says. “You can get the illusion of a French organ [or] a large German baroque organ.”
Laube will join the faculty of the University of Rochester’s Eastman School of Music in New York this fall. In addition to his concert, he will be teaching a master class for Harvard organ students at Memorial Church on March 3.

The SFJAZZ Collective, a San Francisco-based jazz ensemble that has been celebrated from coast to coast for its innovation and talent, will be performing the music of jazz pianist Chick Corea at the Berklee Performance Center on March 8. This group, which is made up of eight experienced jazz musicians including Grammy nominee Miguel Zenón and Grammy winner David Sánchez, manages to attract fans from all walks of life with the wide breadth and diversity of experience represented by its members. “Because it’s the top guys on each instrument, if you’re an older jazz fan, you know who these guys are,” SFJAZZ publicist Marshall Lamm says. “If you’re a younger jazz fan or a younger musician…these are the guys you look up to. These are the guys whose solos you transcribe. These are they guys whose bands you want to be in.”
 Since its inception in 2004, the collective has attracted a group of performers that is both international and noteworthy; the current line up includes members from Venezuela, New Zealand, Israel, Puerto Rico, and the contiguous United States. “Jazz is a very international music, and [in this collective] you’ve got players from all over the world.... It’s a very international group,” Lamm says. While its members are all celebrated in their solo careers, they are each drawn to the democratic aspect of the SFJAZZ Collective. All performers hold an equal voice in the decisions of the collective, something that Lamm says is extremely rare in jazz. 
This democratic approach to jazz has a major influence on this tour’s set list. To create the set list, each member picked a favorite from Chick Corea’s four-decade repertoire, and from this eight-song selection the band will choose four songs every night to perform, along with three to four group originals. To the group’s excitement, the performance has already earned the admiration of Corea. “He has given his approval,” Lamm says. “He thinks it’s a heck of a concept.”

After a half-decade hiatus, the Boston chapter of the nonprofit Zigen Fund is again hosting a benefit concert, to take place at Sanders Theatre on March 3. Featuring a mix of international and local talents, the event celebrates the 2013 Lunar New Year. Proceeds will go towards the Zigen Fund’s mission to support the educational and social development of women and children in impoverished areas of rural China.
Many artists who have previously performed for Zigen are returning to the stage, including international mezzo-soprano singer Guang Yang. A native of Beijing trained at its Central Conservatory of Music, Yang has extensive experience with Western opera and currently performs at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. She will be performing a wide range of music including, by special audience request, “I Love You, China,” a technically demanding classic in the Chinese canon that Yang previously performed at the 2008 Zigen Benefit Concert. Also returning to the stage is Maxwell Li, a graduate of Boston’s New England Conservatory and winner of the prestigious Luciano Pavarotti International Vocal Competition. Li will be performing a duet from Giacomo Puccini’s “La bohème,” among other pieces.
Other performers include local singer Xiaoyi Duan, who owns the Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline; Jing Wei, the winner of the Metropolitan Opera House Vocal Music Contest Prize; and the North American Chorus Association, a Boston music organization. Rounding out the list of performers is Liwen Wang, another returning performer and graduate of the New England Conservatory. Wang will be performing two arias, one by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the other by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák.
This group of performers, as well as the humanitarian mission of the event, make the concert a unique chance to experience the musical talents of the Chinese-American community.  “[This sort of concert is] hard to find among the Chinese community, so I encourage everyone to come and listen,” Wang says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Look around a bustling cafe in Harvard Square and you might see more people clutching Kindles and Nooks than paperbacks. In the age of digitization, e-books and e-readers are allowing for portable, convenient reading experiences, and it seems that weekend trips to the library and the innocent wonder of exploring the aisles of bookstores for hours are rituals of the past. But in Cambridge—as well as across the world—a select group of artisans continue to read and print books the old-fashioned way.
Bookbinderies—craft houses still practicing an art form begun in the 16th century—are flourishing in spite of this trend. How have they maintained their success in the face of digitized literature? After all, what is the point of creating a hardcover copy of a book if the text can be found in an online database with just the click of a mouse?
Even before the advent of literature on screens, though, the art of bookbinding has flown under the radar and been taken for granted. At first glance, the concept of creating covers for books and repairing spines whenever needed might seem mundane tasks to the uninformed. Bookbinders at Widener Library and local bookbinderies acknowledge this perception—they all expressed disbelief and even incredulity when faced with the possibility of an investigation into their craft. “It is a pretty arcane field,” says Tim Jones, director of design and production at Harvard University Press.
Yet, bookbinding has shown itself to be perhaps currently the most resilient art form—although new technological changes have revamped aspects of the method, bookbinding itself has withstood the test of time. As long as there is a demand for specialized books to be preserved, the craftsmanship of binding will forever be relevant. And that seems like more than could be said about the creative design of the iPad.
 “UNDERGROUND HOSPITAL”
Kate Rich, a senior conservation technician at Widener, calls the preservation and imaging department of the library an “underground hospital.” And for good measure—one can’t help but liken the vast, open laboratory in the basement of Widener to an operating room. Every year, 30,000 books go under preservation review and if deemed repairable, will systematically be divided up among the conservation staff of the library to be restored. As Rich sews pages back onto the spine of a book, she remarks how the sewing technique she is using is the same method that was used in the 16th century. “It makes you feel like a part of the tradition,” she says.
Rich, along with the rest of the conservation technicians at Widener, all try to ensure that repairs can be made multiple times, as part of the task of bookbinding entails fixing others’ prior attempts at salvaging books. Ann Antonellis, the preservation assistant for Tozzer Library and Cabot Library, emphasizes this point by showing ragged pieces of a couple of pages held together by Scotch tape and staples, which she ultimately duplicated to be rebound in a whole edition. “We keep telling ourselves, ‘They meant well,’” Antonellis says. In the event that a book falls apart again, it is crucial that the previous repair can be easily undone so that the book can be effectively sewn and glued back together. However, sometimes book conservators will leave in traces of the previous repair because these hints can reveal much about the book’s physical history, which actually allows bookbinders like Rich and Antonellis to preserve as much of the original book as possible. “It’s like remodeling a house,” Antonellis says.
It is in conservation that many of the creative decisions of book repair come into play.  Hand-binding and producing a book from scratch might involve more artistry, but the kinds of materials and methods used in the art of bookbinding are dependent on the final purpose of the book and the time frame in which it is made. For example, the Harvard University Press generally avoids using thinner cloths when printing books for libraries because the edge of a book can easily rub off whenever it is being taken off the shelf. Japanese tissue and wheat paste are commonly used components in repairing books, while acrylic glue and machine bindings are employed to create new books; it is significantly faster and cheaper for industrial publishing companies to mass-produce bestsellers using commercial binding. Additionally, materials used in manual bookbinding are extremely hard to come by due to limited production and high cost. But the expenses of bookbinding aren’t deterring publishers, corporate or individual, from carrying on the craft.
BUSINESS AS USUAL
From a business perspective, the bookbinding sector is no different from other manufacturing and craft industries. Speed and cost efficiency are taken into heavy consideration in order to maximize productivity and profits, and a balance must be found between painstakingly laying the foundation of a book and producing at a rate fast enough to be profitable. “A modern binding line needs time and a slower process to make [engravings] extremely clean with better craftsmanship,” Jones says.
This sentiment is echoed by Peter Foster, who works part-time at Widener Library and also runs his own independent bookbindery,  The Brookline Bindery. Foster experiences the high demands of fine binding whenever he adds gold stylings to the numerous cookbooks, family bibles, and dissertations that his clients bring in to be restored or rebound. “Each binder has their own certain style [in] using different procedures to improve quality and speed,” Foster says.
Foster operates his climate-controlled workshop in the basement of his house. Having transitioned from a previous career in computer science to bookbinding 10 years ago, Foster and his personal business are proof that the art of bookbinding has by no means died. His bindery has been sustained throughout its history by the multitude of projects clients have brought in over time. Surrounding the large working table in the center of the room are scrolls of differently dyed vellums, sample books full of cloths and leathers, and an assortment of finishing tools used for gold engravings. “There’s a level of pride that goes into the work done,”  Foster says. He enjoys the craft because he has the opportunity to utilize his creativity in a productive manner. “Each project is unique because there is no recipe, and you have to design and construct on your own,” he says.
Techniques such as gold stamping help to add a customizable element to bookbinding. Rather than randomly attaching whatever seemed visually appealing to the outside of a book, around the mid-1800s bookbinders began to add simple symbols to the cover to make the outer design relevant to the theme of the book.  Crosses began to appear on the covers of bibles, and little insignias like anchors covered books concerning sailing. It was during this period that wealthy people began to view books as luxury items and requested bookbinders to create adornments on the spines of their books to help embellish personal libraries. Textual and symbolic additions onto the covers of books are now used to communicate the content of the book. “Text is no longer an afterthought at this point,” says Todd Pattison, the collections conservator for the Harvard College Library. “Before, the publisher controlled the appearance of the cover and used it to sell books and, as they say, to ‘follow the money.’”
However, much of the current aesthetic decision-making still comes from the bookbinders or publishers themselves. “Nine times out of 10, clients choose my sample designs because they don’t want to take a risk,” says Jeffrey Altepeter, head of the bookbinding department at the North Bennet Street School in downtown Boston.
Foster has also discovered this trend in his customers’ behavior when he holds design consultations. “I sometimes have to limit the number of color and paper options I offer, since they tend to become overwhelmed.”
COVERING OLD GROUND
Before these artistic choices can be made, aspiring bookbinders must first develop a broad foundation of skills in the art and become versed in a variety of techniques. At North Bennet Street School, which offers the only full-time bookbinding program in the entire country, students learn the basic procedures and fundamental skills of bookbinding over a two-year period. During the first year, students learn 18th-century-style binding techniques such as making composite models of traditional binding structures by sewing signatures—unbound sections of a book—to the spine. During the second year, students venture into creating leather covers for books using materials like calf and pig skins. As they gain more experience, many of the students usually try to implement what they learn into presentation work, making folders, portfolios, and gift boxes. Altepeter tries to make the course applicable, which sometimes entails allowing students to work on small, custom-edition projects for willing customers. The quality of the materials his students handle is also very important to Altepeter. “There’s not much of a point in making a cover if it’s going to be a throwaway,” he says.
The curriculum of the North Bennet Street School is focused on imitating historical styles in the interest of crafting books from scratch, but the biggest demand for hand-binding outside of the educational environment has still been in repair and conservation. “Bookbinders haven’t been involved in making books for a really long time,” says Katherine Gray, a conservation technician at Widener Library who studied at the North Bennet Street School. “Most students go on to do conservation because that’s what’s available after graduation. There’s a high employment rate for repair since the industry has turned towards making nicer books for bookish people, rather than paperbacks.”
Due partially to technological changes in the industry, the focus of the art form has shifted from making large editions of books by hand to working with books of a much smaller, personal scale. “Technology has changed our field, what drives our work, and what our work is,” Altepeter says. “No large volumes are made by hand now. That’s just not the way it works anymore.” Although machine-quality binding is faster, it cannot be used in conservation.
“GRANDPA JEFF’S KINDLE”
Contrary to expectation, e-reader technology and the higher productivity rate of commercial binding have not been significantly detrimental to the hand bookbinding industry. In fact, the people that are going to such bookbinderies in order to preserve their beloved books reflect a current trend: there is now a higher appreciation for the binderies among the general public and a greater emphasis on specialized, individual production. Independent binderies do quite well, according to Altepeter, since they are set up for the right scale of hand bookbinding work, which is not conducive to the “large-shop approach.”
Altepeter also firmly believes bookbinding is considered an art form, even though the underlying purpose for the craft has primarily been repair and conservation of other art. To him, every step of the process is entirely creative, from designing the shape of the outer boards to selecting the appropriate texture of leather in which to bind the book. Using the skills of bookbinding also allows creative binders to freely explore other projects. For example, Foster is in the process of creating his own book, a two-by-two-inch novel about an angel trapped in a net, presented physically on the inside cover of the book with webbing and a small paper angel. With the same techniques he employs to repair library textbooks, Foster is thus able to create art from scratch and produce an interactive book.
Additionally, most bookbinders have expressed their belief that people are now beginning to value books on a different level and to think critically about the books that were special to them and their families. The conservators at Widener Library say they have seen this positive change in their patrons and consider themselves lucky that those patrons are very engaged with the condition of the books they borrow. “It is a tremendous asset that our users care about the collections,” Rich says.
Foster also believes that the e-reader trend will mostly affect commercial binding because the materials that are typically digitized, he feels, are transient publications like computer programming materials. “The art of hand-binding will continue because people like the beauty of books. People will always like the feeling of opening up a book and taking the time to turn a page. With the electronic screen, there is a pressure to move along quickly,” he says.
Altepeter agrees. “My grandkids are not going to say, ‘This is Grandpa Jeff’s Kindle!’ They’re not going to relate to that. People don’t want to read certain things on an iPad, like literature or poetry.” The bookbinding instructor also thinks that the growing desire among the general public to reconnect with their beloved books, to treasure the unique experience that is reading and holding a physical copy of a book, has slowed the e-book craze.
“I want to think it’s a long-term phase,” he says. “I hope so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At  center stage in the international limelight, Beyoncé Giselle  Knowles-Carter is the poster girl of fame. But first and foremost,  Beyoncé is a person, one who feels as deeply as her fans and critics  alike. In “Life Is But A Dream,” the autobiographical film she directed  and produced that was released on Feb. 16 on HBO, Beyoncé poignantly  gives a reminder of just that. She explains her journey to  independence—from taking on the challenge of managing herself to finding  happiness.  Through a medley of professional footage of her onstage  performances, behind-the-scenes moments, home movies, and private videos  taken by Beyoncé on her laptop, “Life Is But a Dream” captures how  personal the artistic experience of music is to Beyoncé and exposes the  complications of fame.
 
By  opening with contrasting scenes of Beyoncé in concert and alone in  thought, “Life Is But a Dream” introduces Beyoncé as both an image and a  person, a dichotomy that is explored further as the film progresses. In  this way, the film sets a central theme, creating a focus for the film  despite the different types of clips used and mix of flashbacks and  recent footage. This sequence visually supports the beginning of  Beyoncé’s narration as she expresses the need for personal independence  amid her overwhelming career. She continues on to explain how the  demands of upholding her image in her career caused estrangement between  her and her father, Mathew Knowles, who had been her manager since she  began performing in Destiny’s Child. The choice of narration in these  beginning scenes creates the perspective through which the film presents  Beyonce’s life. It sets an honest lens that makes the film more of a  personal testimony than a documentary.
 
Throughout  the film, clips of Beyoncé singing alone in both private recordings and  the studio are integrated between her narrations. A connection is shown  between her testimony and the lyrics of her songs.  At one moment, she  sits in the backseat of a car, singing the song “Listen,” the lyrics of  which convey emotion reminiscent of the hurt she feels in her  relationship with her father. When she sings in the studio, the camera  focuses on her facial expressions. The raw emotions, in both her voice  and body, reveal how her artistry is the opportunity to sing from her  heart. This builds on her early statement about her choice to form her  own management company, Parkwood Entertainment. In taking ownership of  her career, she claimed independence for her artistry and, most  importantly, for herself.
 
By  conveying the dichotomy of Beyoncé’s fame, the film provides a  perceptive criticism of today’s culture of entertainment. Beyoncé  elucidates how the public eye often doesn’t focus on the deep  musicianship of a celebrity, stating, “All you think of is the picture  and the image that you see all day, everyday, and you don’t see the  human form.” She continues on that the present is no longer the age of  Nina Simone, with whom people fell in love for her voice. Then, people  were enamored by the art of music, not the life of the artist. And  Beyoncé admits how hard it is to cope with people exploiting her life  for entertainment. Through the honesty of Beyoncé’s testimony, the film  exposes the reality of fame, going further to highlight the gravity of  its consequences.
 
This  reality is emphasized most by the inclusion of Beyoncé’s testimony  about the most profound experiences in her womanhood—her miscarriage and  the birth of her daughter. Throughout the film, she expresses joy for  the experience of having a new life inside her—she gave birth to her  daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, in January of 2012. But fame had already  caused detriments in her life, most notably separation from her father,  which leads her to state,  “I had to hide the best thing in my life.”  She admits, “It’s hard to go through painful experiences in the public  eye. It’s hard to have closure.” She goes on to share her experience of  miscarriage. She explains how right after that moment, she went to the  studio and wrote the saddest song she has ever written, but she does not  mention the name of the song. By sharing something so personally  painful, Beyoncé shows that music is not only for personal enjoyment,  but is also a form of therapy for her. The film highlights that fame  puts even the most personal experiences of an artist life at risk for  public exploitation.
 
As  Beyoncé admits, stardom is a fantasy. But, the struggles that every  person experiences is a reality. “Life Is But a Dream” not only gives  deep insight into the thoughts and life of Beyoncé, but also deeply  analyzes the experience of fame. Beyoncé shares, “Ultimately, you’re  independent from you knowing who you are and being happy with yourself.”  But, as the film shows, finally getting to that point in life is not an  easy journey.

History
It may come as a surprise that modern-day K-pop started in a country that once lacked its own pop culture. Hallmarks of the K-pop culture now include live concerts that sell out in minutes, platinum status digital and physical album sales, appearances of artists on television miniseries and talk shows, and glamorous magazine photo shoots. However, music was not always a commercial phenomenon or commodity.
Just as American blues evolved into modern day mainstream pop, rock, and hip-hop music, “pansori”—or Korean opera sung along to a drum—was the cornerstone for what developed into K-pop. The commodification of Korean music began in the 1920s, with the first recordings of traditional pansori songs. In the 1930s and 40s, “trot” (also called “pong-jjak” in reference to its rhythmic beat)—a genre inspired by the popular Foxtrot dance tunes in the United States, took center stage. The public witnessed the rise of the first Korean recordings explicitly made for consumption.
The arrival of foreign troops during the Korean War inevitably ushered in American trends and songs, which heavily influenced the next stages of the evolution of Korean pop culture. The first vestiges of rock came on the horizon in Korea with the massive popularity of the Rolling Stones and Elvis Presley. The arrival of rock ‘n’ roll in Korea also meant that contact with the outside world slowly began to open up. In the following decades—the 1960s and 1970s—groups such as the Beatles and the Eagles influenced the development of K-rock. The genre was perfectly suitable for the generation coming out of the ashes of war, working together to rebuild a nation.
However, with the dictatorship of Park Chung-Hee, outside influence on the growing Korean pop culture came to a standstill and the country became insular. Popular music adopted a softer, less “rebellious” tone, setting the stage for music that blended softer strains of rock with R&B and jazz. This led to ballads—songs marked not by a powerful beat or an exciting chord progression, but by a talented singer who can hold his or her own. Ballads have remained popular into the modern day, and now, every high-grossing Korean television drama miniseries is sure to include at least one ballad song. Some trademarks of ballads are a nostalgic vibe, sweet or sad lyrics (sometimes overly so), and quite often revolve around love (or lost love).
Riding on the tides of the 1988 Olympics, in Seoul, the 1990s brought democracy, the growth of artistic freedom, and the return of outside pop music influences as well as experimentation with music forms within Korea. Parallel with the rise of Michael Jackson, Madonna, and boy bands like the Backstreet Boys, so too came about the first vestiges of hip- hop, dance music, and boy bands in Korea. The song, “I Know (난 알아요)” by Seo Taiji and the Boys (서태지) ushered in the new era of K-pop. Seo Taiji and the Boys dominated the music charts, performed on television shows to ecstatic crowds, and drew a wide fan base. Thus, the modern Korean pop culture was officially born and management companies began to explore creative ways to produce K-pop artists that would draw fans both at home and abroad.
A Snapshot of Old School K-pop Royalty
H.O.T. (1996-2001) 
H.O.T. (aka High-Five of Teenagers), the original K-pop idols, was created to target a teenage audience. They successfully captured the hearts of fan girls and boys alike with songs about teenage angst and love. Member Tony An was scouted in LA by SM Entertainment, beginning the trend of K-pop groups often incorporating members from overseas. Popular song: “Candy.” 
S.E.S. (1997-2002)
A bubblegum pop trio, they are regarded by many as the female H.O.T. Their group name comes from combining the initials of its members, Sea, Eugene, and Shoo. Popular songs: “Dreams Come True” and “Oh! My Love.”
Fin.K.L. (1998-2002)
In sharp contrast to the sweet pop songs of S.E.S., Fin.K.L sang soulful R&B-infused ballads. Since disbanding, member Lee Hyori in particular has enjoyed an extremely successful career as a model, television show host, singer, and animal rights activist. Popular songs: “To My Prince (나의 왕자님께)” and “Forever Love (영원한 사랑).”
Shinhwa (1998-Present)
The longest-lived K-pop boy band, Shinhwa is still active and even hosts their own television talk show. Each member is also currently active as a solo singer, actor, or CEO of an entertainment company. Popular songs: “Eusha Eusha (으쌰으쌰),” “I Pray 4 U,” “Wedding,” and “Venus.”
1TYM (1998-2006)
A charismatic and energetic hip-hop group, 1TYM was the first hip-hop idol group. Member Teddy Park has become the most lucrative producer for hip-hop production giant YG Entertainment and member Danny Im, a California native, hosts a talk show on entertainment channel Mnet. Popular song: “One Love.”
g.o.d. (1999-2006) 
Their name stands for “Groove Over Dose,” and they took the music scene by storm with groovy ballad “To Mother.” All members went solo after disbanding, and lead singer Kim Tae Woo is particularly well-known. Former member Yoon Kye Sang is now a famous actor. Popular songs: “To Mother (어머님께)” and “Lies (거짓말).”

Some time in 1970—or it might have been 1969, details are a little sketchy—a little-known singer walked into De Luxe Studios in Cincinnati, cut one monster of a record, and then disappeared. Marie “Queenie” Lyons, whose album “Soul Fever” is one of the funkiest soul LPs ever to drop, sunk without a trace. She hasn’t recorded since.
For a while in the late ‘60s, things seemed to be going Lyons’ way. She was a regular on the Chitlin’ Circuit—a network of venues across the country that catered to black performers and audiences—and was even hired by James Brown to be one of his “Funky Divas.” She released a couple of singles on De Luxe in 1969, a year before “Soul Fever” came out. But like so many talented performers before and since, Lyons couldn’t catch a break, and her incredible brand of hard-rocking R&B has only been appreciated by soul-crazed audiophiles such as myself. That changes now.
I could name about 6,000 reasons why I think it is a shame that so few people have heard of Lyons, but for me the most grievous one is that she perfectly captured the feel of the times. By the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, soul music had lost its happy-go-lucky charm and was rapidly evolving into hard-edged funk as the Black Power movement gained mainstream attention. In four short years, “Number 1 Soul Brother” James Brown had gone from singing about his baby’s “Good Good Lovin’” to exclaiming, “Say it Loud—I’m Black and I’m Proud.” Everything about Queenie Lyons, from her badass voice to her Angela Davis-style afro—exuded this sort of newfound confidence and power.
“Soul Power” is full of fantastic soul-funk hybrids, but probably the best embodiment of the charisma and resilience of the era is her cover of the jazz standard “Fever.” Lyons’ version starts with breathy, spoken lyrics—an homage to the greats who recorded the song before her, such as Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee. However, about 10 seconds in, the saxophones lay down a funky line that leaves no doubt as to the direction the song is taking. By the the time the second verse rolls around, all pretense of jazz-age restraint is abandoned. Lyons sings, “Listen to me baby / hear every word I say / no one can love I like I do / because they don’t know how to love you my way” with such husky-voiced power and confidence, it seems more like a threat than a plea to a distracted lover. By the sound of it, if Queenie caught her man cheating, he’d be lucky if he got a three-second head start.
Lyons’ vocal performance isn’t the only thing going for “Fever.” Her backing band lays down a tight, high-energy groove that perfectly complemented the song’s hard funk sound. The rhythm section chugs along during most of the verse, giving Lyons the space she needs to shine. However, every time the arrangement might start to drag, the saxophones burst in with their signature line—often signaling a key change up a half-step, which further adds to the song’s energy. The song never feels out of control; The band keeps its cool, and the result is a as good as anything recorded by James Brown or Sly and the Family Stone.
I personally don’t know what is worse: the fact that Marie “Queenie” Lyons only recorded one album, or the fact that the album she did record was left cruelly unappreciated for so long. “Soul Fever” should be considered one of the best albums of the early ‘70s, and Lyons should have been rewarded with a long career full of promising releases. But history doesn’t work that way. Due to a combination of small-label politics and a miniscule marketing budget, “Soul Fever” never got the release it deserved, and we are all poorer for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We were out on the beach playing with paddles, a game with a name I could never remember. Our young lives shone bright in that November sun. Adrian and I weren’t really that young, but I felt like I could live forever.
A potbellied, life-weathered man yelled things we couldn’t understand from his seat on the sand a short distance away. His beat-up leather skin had been worn by the beach like driftwood in the sun. He was crazy, drunk, or high—maybe all three. His shouts were garbled by the waves and the wind. Our game was like the tide, pushing us in his direction. As his words became audible, we realized he’d been keeping score, the referee of a game that he hadn’t been invited to between two people he didn’t know. According to him, I was winning. He wanted to play. I felt vulnerable in my beachy near-nudity and Adrian was put off, so we moved in the other direction.
The man got up and walked toward us. We looked at each other incredulously as he approached. Adrian instinctively took a defensive stance in front of me and attempted to tell this bum to piss off in the nicest way possible. He kept talking at us, though, adjusting his filthy cap and slipping shorts, asking to play the game with us. Adrian decided to entertain him.
“Where you from, man?”
“Chicago,” the stranger replied.
“That’s a beautiful city.”
“How bout you guys?”
“I’m from here. She’s from L.A,” Adrian replied. “What brought you to Miami?”
“Work.”
“What do you do?”
“Electrician. Miami was good to me—then I lost my job.”
“Sucks,” Adrian said sympathetically. “I’m sorry,” I said. “Maybe those girls will play with you.” The man turned around, seeing the topless girls behind him that he hadn’t noticed. He turned back to us, wide-eyed and flustered, and yelled a startled “Hey!”, the remark he used to mean just about anything—punctuation, stalling, surprise. He had trouble focusing on us. He looked back at the breasts on display and to us again. And suddenly, he asked if we were married.
“Yeah.”
“How long?”
“Two years—and we still like each other.”
That was not true, like most of the things Adrian told our new friend.
“Are you married?” “I was,” he said. “Not any more, though.” “What happened?” “She hates me!” “Well, that’s a problem,” I said, and we laughed lightly. “She cheated on me. It wasn’t really that—I had my fun. I got home to her and a guy at our house, though. I at least kept all my stuff outside, not in our house.” We let him talk, agreeing about keeping “our house” sacred. At first he said he’d handled it well, given that he’d been unfaithful, too. But his story changed.
“I threw her stuff out the window.” “First story or second?” “Second. All of it. That was our house, you know?” “You got any kids?” Adrian asked. “Yeah, a daughter.” “What’s her name?” He pointed to the second of his three tattoos, which read “R.D.,” placed just under “Out of Control” and above an image of barbed wire, all stacked on his sorry left bicep. “Rachel.” “Is she ‘out of control’?” “Hey! No, she’s a nice young lady.” “She back in Chicago?” “Yeah, with her mom.” He said he saw his daughter sometimes and talked to her often, but his shifting gaze told me he hadn’t for a long time.
The two men continued talking as my heart sank in silence. I pitched in a few words intermittently. He said to Adrian, “Hey! I like her.” He paused bashfully, trying not to be forward. “She’s cute.” “Thanks,” I said quietly. “Yeah, she is,” Adrian said, wrapping his arm around my waist. “What’s your name, man?” “Robert.” Adrian extended his hand to Robert and they shook. “Wanna play a game?” “Yeah!” Robert replied so happily it made me sadder. “Not with her though, she’s too good.” We laughed. “Yeah, she kicked my ass. Let’s play.”
They went down to the water. I sat on the sand, watching the man I loved give joy and validation to a man who’d likely felt neither for a long, long time. I watched this sad stranger smile like a boy at play as Adrian let him win by a point. “It was a good game,” they agreed. I don’t know if I’d ever loved anyone so much. “Well, we gotta go, man. It was nice to meet you, Robert.” We all shook hands, but I wanted to hug them. Adrian and I took off, leaving Robert on the beach.
As we walked into the setting sun, Adrian said, “I like doing that, entertaining crazy people,” making our chat seem lighter than it was. I said, “He just needed somebody to talk to.” “I wonder how he got to be so miserable,” he said, and I understood why he lied to Robert. “He was messed up on all kinds of stuff, but mostly loneliness, I think. I’m glad we talked to him.” “Me too.” One day, I’ll teach my children about life at the beach. I’ll point to the waves and tell them about flux and flow, beauty and danger, time and temporality, and about how no matter how many castles you build or how many times you write your name in the sand, the waves always crash. And sometimes they drag you under or take you out to sea, but somehow they always manage to bring you back to shore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert Fogarty's moving photography project "Dear World" takes the phrase "written all over your face" to a new level. In each of his photos, Fogarty depicts individuals with short, impactful phrases written on their skin, such as "I'm Going to College" or "Defend the American Dream." Fogarty is due to visit Harvard tomorrow.
At a place like Harvard, where inner thoughts can often be smothered beneath textbook phrases, a little openness is never a bad thing. Flyby presents the inner confessions of Harvard—a whole new set of phrases shattering the façades that Harvard students tend to live behind. Let's hope the marker washes off.
If our gallery inspires you to share your message with the world, Fogarty will be taking students' portraits at the Harvard Kennedy School tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, Chris Kaskie, the president of the prominent online music magazine Pitchfork Media, participated in a public interview with Panos Panay, the founder of Sonicbids, a portal that brings together concert organizers and bands. Pitchfork Media, founded in 1995, is an online publication dedicated to music journalism, with a particular focus on up-and-coming, independent music. The event was part of the 20th Annual James G. Zafris Jr. Distinguished Lecture Series for Music Business/Management at the Berklee College of Music.
Straightforward and honest, Kaskie told the story of his early days at Pitchfork. While he was working at the Chicago-based satirical publication The Onion, he was an avid music fan and Pitchfork reader. One day, Kaskie ordered a review book published by Pitchfork and never got it. So, he decided to email the company’s founder, Ryan Schreiber, to tell him that he, Kaskie, was proficient in sales and would be willing to guide business operations. Schreiber hired Kaskie over the phone and said, “Dude, let’s go have a beer.” After that beer, Kaskie moved into Schreiber’s basement and began to work on the site and live with Schreiber’s cats.
Schreiber and Kaskie knew from the beginning that they wanted to do something unlike the rest of the online music criticism world. “When everybody was zigging, we wanted to zag,” Kaskie said. He claimed that the willingness to do good business comes before profit.  The big moment came in 2005 with the launch of Pitchfork Festival, then called the Intonation Music Festival, a music festival organized by Pitchfork, which attracted 20,000 ardent fans. Kaskie attributed this success to the fact that this event, which he described as a counter-festival, was designed to be deliberately different from mainstream music festivals.
Kaskie also talked about problems he sees in the contemporary cultural approach to music. In particular, he mentioned passive listening, which is the phenomenon in which listeners receive a playlist dictated by tools and algorithms designed to reflect their taste, rather than selected by the listeners directly. According to Kaskie, the aim of Pitchfork is to avoid this sort of occurrence by putting people in touch with new music through recommendations directly from other music lovers, rather than through an automated algorithm. Kaskie’s advice to the audience on how to find music was curating a Twitter feed, reading Pitchfork, and simply talking to people. “[Commercial radio is] the most concise filtration of music,” Kaskie said.
Other problems he identified included the estrangement of artist from fan, and the fleeting intangible nature of digital media. Kaskie asserted that the removal of intermediaries between the artist and the fan produces more uniqueness and transparency in the music, which he sees as a major advantage. He also predicted that the future of the music industry would involve the resurrection of the album, and said he still buys vinyl to be able to leave something for his kids.
After the lecture, Kaskie spoke with The Harvard Crimson.
The Harvard Crimson: Do you think recognition depends more or less on the merit of the musician than on networking and the musician’s ability to reach a wider audience?
Chris Kaskie: I think it will inevitably always be merit, because that’s what’s going to last... Ultimately the quality of your art is what’s going to resonate with any audience, whether it be big or small. So, growing that audience is the challenge, and how you do that, and as long as the art and the quality of your art maintains itself recognition should grow. But you have to work for that, obviously, whether it be live or finding the right promotional outlets and developing relationships with publications [and] blogs—whatever—that just know what you’re doing. And labels I think are still a huge part of that.
THC: If merit is that important, why do you think people who claim to value quality in music are drawn to discovering the obscure? Why is mainstream not considered good quality?
CK: I don’t know. I think that everyone wants to be unique and [have] their taste in music be unique, so as something becomes bigger or becomes more ubiquitous, it becomes more [conventional]. There’s a tendency for any invested music fan to go different [which is] becoming the norm even if the norm is really small. I think there’s a certain person that wants to keep finding it, but you also run the risk of—if you go too far, you forget the stuff that you may have gone past but still also very good. You need to make sure you don’t ignore that.
THC: How do you think Pitchfork plays a role in the artist’s efforts to turn fans into customers?
CK: The festival is the closest thing to that, but no, we don’t have a purpose like that. Our job is to cover music as honestly and as best as we can. Whether that’s success or non-success is irrelevant to our thinking. I mean we’re not in the business of creating, making bands. We’re talking about what’s good and bad, really. And if that ends up helping expose them to more all eyes or ears whatever, that’s great, and the closest we can get to that is, “Here’s all our favorite stuff, we hope you enjoy it.”
THC: Are there any new features that we should look forward to?
CK: I think we’re going to continue to enhance the way we build our mobile platforms because we want to have our site available to everybody wherever they want it. It’s exciting because we’ve always been a website and while print moved backwards and went online we’re looking at how to push online forward. We’re definitely in the position where we want to  innovate online publishing, whereas before we were a website when the print is the one that’s innovating, at least in many people’s eyes. Now, it’s a challenge that we fully feel like we’re in the driver’s seat and/or the passenger seat and kind of ready to tackle.
THC: What are some music events and festivals that you’re looking forward to in the upcoming months?
CK: South by Southwest [music festival] is always fun. It’s the only real thing that I do that becomes kind of industry-specific, so there’s an element of “bummerness” to that too. But there’s a lot of industry people that I really like, so that’s okay too. And then we have our festival in July. We [also] program a stage at a festival in Barcelona, Spain. It’s probably the best festival on earth. We’re one of the six or seven stages, but we have a very large stage. I look forward to that because the Spanish love what we do and they also have a very good vibrant local scene. The European festival stuff is game-changing—I wish we could be like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a Harvard student anonymously published an op-ed in Thursday’s edition of The Crimson detailing the College’s failures in dealing with their mental illness, mental health issues took center-stage at Harvard. On the same day that the article was published, Paul J. Barreira, Director of Harvard University Health Services, introduced a series of new initiatives concerning stress and mental health. In a show of support for substantive change, more than 150 students rallied in front of Massachusetts Hall on Friday, proclaiming that, “Harvard can do better.”
As Thursday’s anonymous op-ed makes clear, the mishandling of a mental health case can have horribly damaging effects. The administration should revise University policies so that no student suffering from mental illness—including those on substantial financial aid—is ever pushed into a corner where treatment is difficult to obtain or prohibitively costly. All students should be able to receive counseling if they need it, and no student should hesitate to get help for fear that their financial aid might be jeopardized. Furthermore, there must be a safety net—a mental health emergency fund, perhaps—that ensures that students suffering from mental illness who cannot return home due to a precarious family situation are provided for. We cannot afford to discourage students from receiving treatment for fear that they would be forced to return to a home that is not conducive to their betterment.
Thankfully, Harvard seems at least to be cognizant of the need for more counseling opportunities on campus. According to Barreira, the hiring of more psychiatrists will mean that students will have quicker and easier access to the treatment they need. Other programs, such as a peer education group, will also help students cope with mental illness. These measures are certainly steps in the right direction and will hopefully send a message to students that they need not suffer alone.
The University should also authorize changes to its financial aid system and to its policies concerning medical leave, which appear to have been so egregiously damaging to the anonymous writer’s experience. The top levels of University administration must establish policies that coordinate the actions of financial aid, HUHS, and any other relevant offices to ensure that from now on mentally ill students on full financial aid are able to receive the treatment they need without fear of being sent away. If students like Thursday’s op-ed writer are too afraid of jeopardizing their place at the College to step forward and get help, their condition will never be ameliorated, and they may even become a danger to themselves or others. The College would then be at fault for their suffering, having stood by policies that intimidate students in need rather than help them proactively.
HUHS’ announced measures toward improving mental health at Harvard are positive steps. It remains deplorable, however, that any student could have gone through the ordeal experienced by the author of Thursday’s op-ed, and Harvard needs to address the failings that led to that ordeal. Students should be able to seek help without fearing for their financial aid or even their enrollment at the College. Any university should make an honest effort to prioritize the well-being of its students, mentally or otherwise. To that end, enacting some serious reform is the only responsible thing for Harvard to do.

The expansion of instant replay has been a hot topic in baseball over the past couple of years, and it appears as if the proponents of expanded instant replay are winning, by a large margin. It’s not just casual baseball fans, either: according to Fangraphs, the online baseball statistics Bible, those that describe themselves as watching twenty or more baseball games a month are significantly more likely to support instant replay than those that watch five or fewer.  Perhaps the issue is with Fangraphs’ viewer base, but it still resonates that only fourteen percent of respondents were neutral to or in opposition of the idea of instant replay. It appears as if the use of expanded replay is an inevitable outcome. Expanded replay, however, is a bad idea for the sport. There are two main concepts that proponents of instant replay refer to: fairness, and general enjoyableness of the game.
The issue of fairness is justifiable. In 2010, Armando Galarraga lost a perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning due to a blown call. Ask him what he thinks about limited replay, and the response is unlikely to be positive. Ask a manager what he thinks about instant replay after a blown call loses him the game, and you are guaranteed a similar reaction.
The thing about instant replay, though, is that it is not inherently fair. The better team does not necessarily win every game, nor does the lesser team necessarily benefit from instant replay. This is why baseball is played out over a 162-game season: to reduce variability in outcomes. This is also why baseball conducts its playoffs over multiple series rather than in single games.
Furthermore, baseball has not necessarily been moving toward a “fairer” system. Before the 2012 season, the very owners that voted in favor of expanded replay also voted in favor of expanding the playoff field from eight teams to ten, implementing a new wild card in each league. This serves only to dilute the playoff field and make it easier for inferior teams to win in October. The new system implements a play-in game between the two wild cards in each league, whereby the winner advances to the traditional division series and the loser goes home. By foregoing the series structure, this gamebecomes nothing more than a toss-up between the two teams, with luck playing a managerial role in determining which one ends up in the division series.
This new system is not, in and of itself, fair. And yet, baseball decided to make the move toward it, because the new system offered far more drama than the old. When asked about the new system during the 2012 playoffs, Commissioner Bud Selig said he didn’t know “how it could work out any better than this.” Indeed, the excitement created by the new system more than offset any arguments about “fairness.”
Instant replay, at its heart, undermines the integrity of the sport. This applies to more than just baseball—in 2005, the then-general secretary of FIFA Urs Linsi said about expanded replay in soccer, “football’s human element must be retained. It mirrors life itself and we have to protect it.” At their hearts, sports are controlled by human nature. For that reason, we have banned performance-enhancing drugs: We want our competitions to reflect the best and worst of human performance. Though we don't tend to give umpires the respect they deserve, their role as impartial arbiters does not imply they be correct, or anything more than simply human.
Part of the joy of debating about baseball is that you can’t always reach a sensible conclusion. We can reasonably state that the Houston Astros are probably worse than the Washington Nationals, but we cannot definitively state that the Baltimore Orioles were a better baseball team than the Tampa Bay Rays last year, even though we know for a fact that the Orioles made the playoffs and the Rays did not. Banning instant replay adds another layer to mystery: if it hadn’t been for that blown call, what would have happened? What team was better?
We can’t know for certain. And that’s the thing: we love sports, but we love talking about sports just as much. When our team wins because of darned luck, or a blown call, we don’t care, because we’re the champions. But if we lose, we feel vindicated by luck or other factors. The Red Sox didn’t make the playoffs because of Bobby Valentine, and the infield fly rule cost the Braves their season.
Yes, ideally we would like the best team to win every year. But that’s boring. Besides, if umpires can view instant replays, who are we going to blame when we lose?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I found out that the International Olympic Committee decided to drop wrestling from the 2020 Olympics, I blinked, told someone to pinch me, blinked, told someone to punch me, and then peered outside to see whether unicorns were rollerblading down Dunster Street.
They weren’t, so I knew this was for real. Next, I fired up Chrome and witnessed the online campaign that was unfolding in a machine-gun burst of tweets: #saveolympicwrestling. #saveolympicwrestling. #saveolympicwrestling.
Why in Zeus’s name was an Olympic fixture since 708 B.C.E. suddenly nixed? Has the Olympic mission to celebrate sport imploded? (More on this later; the short answer is yes.)
Apparently, the International Olympic Committee was deciding between cutting wrestling and cutting modern pentathlon. Modern pentathlon, which involves shooting, horseback riding, fencing, and swimming (although not all at once, alas) seeks to mimic the skills required of a nineteenth century cavalry officer.
(Protests abound for modern pentathlon itself to be replaced by ultramodern pentathlon, which would simulate the skills of a 21st century tank commando in Baghdad. I’ve also heard requests for Call-Of-Duty Pentathlon.)
The IOC claimed that wrestling was phased out partly due to floor-hugging ratings. According to its statement, the IOC examined all the sports on nearly forty criteria, such as TV views and popularity, “to ensure the Olympic Games remain relevant to sports fans of all generations.” So wrestling was just unpopular, like the last kid picked for kickball during recess.
This can’t be the whole story. Wrestling has federations in 177 countries, while modern pentathlon has federations in only 108. Many countries in Eastern Europe and central Asia see wrestling as their national sport. This past summer, 71 nations sent wrestlers to London, and only 26 sent modern pentathletes. Moreover, modern pentathlon averages 12.5 viewers globally, whereas wrestling reels in twice that amount.
As in every tragicomedy in which icy data subverts the fronted story, the usual suspect makes a cameo appearance: politics. As the LA Times reports, the son of a former IOC president and current member of the executive board, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., is also vice president of the International Modern Pentathlon Union.
In any case, here’s the clinch: the decision to etch wrestling off the Olympic program doesn’t just hurt sports fans across the world. It also corrupts the Olympian mission. Instead of celebrating athleticism for its own sake, the athletic festival panders to popularity polls; instead of glorifying what is difficult and hard, it chases ratings. The IOC’s decision to cut wrestling shouldn’t concern just wrestlers; it should concern us all.
What is more, the IOC decision reflects how the digital bricolage we call modernity shifts the athletic landscape. Press coverage converges on a select squadron of athletes, usually runners and swimmers and basketball players, who participate in sports the average family of 2.59 can understand (ball goes into net = win). Sports, like wrestling, that are suffused with techniques opaque to non-initiates are doomed to the bench. They are tweeted less. Worshipping Internet hit counts and commercialism refracts our perceptions about which sports are worth showing.
All this is well and good, except that the purpose of the Olympics was never about online ratings. Were ancient Thebans live-tweeting the latest minotaur-slaying contest? Do you think Milo of Croton—the ancient Greek wrestler who supposedly carried a bull on his shoulders before slaughtering it and scarfing it down in one day—gave a mite that his Olympic match didn’t crack YouTube’s top ten? Well, he told me he didn’t. A central purpose of the original Olympics was to celebrate athleticism just for the sake of athleticism, and there is something downright pure about that.
In fact, it’s still a central pillar of the modern Olympics, which is supposed to “oppose any commercial abuse of sport.” That last quote comes from rule 1.2.10 of the IOC charter.
All of which is why we need wrestling back on the Olympic program. The IOC’s decision to drop wrestling is up for reversal in both May and September, and every second beats worriedly for this grandfather clock of sports. Let’s honor the Olympic ideal by recognizing that the purpose of the ancient events is not to push us forward through the age of modern media, but rather to bring us back to a time when none of that stuff mattered anyway.
In the meantime, I better go post this on twitter. #saveolympicwrestling.

Jews love a good argument, and I am no exception, so when I saw the “Open Hillel” petition, I quickly signed it. The appeal, begun by the Progressive Jewish Alliance, would allow Hillel-affiliated groups to co-sponsor events on site with all campus organizations, provided they are not anti-Semitic or racist. According to Hillel International’s current Israel guidelines, Hillel will not “partner with, house, or host organizations, groups, or speakers that ... deny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish and democratic state; ... delegitimize, demonize, or apply a double standard to Israel; ... or support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against (BDS) the State of Israel.”
Here, those regulations have been interpreted loosely. Last year, Harvard Hillel sponsored an event with Peter A. Beinart, a liberal Zionist supportive of a West Bank settlement boycott. In 2010, a former member of Fatah spoke here. Two years earlier, Hillel hosted an anti-occupation art exhibit. Other Hillels, unfortunately, have not been so generous.
Judaism is a big-tent religion, and we should be open to reasonable dissenting voices. Anti-Zionism is not inherently anti-Semitic. Classical Reform ideology, universalist and assimilationist, rejected the construction of Jewishness as an ethnic identity. In keeping with Marxist thought, Hadash, Israel’s Communist party, believes the country should be a state of its citizens rather than of the Jews. Harvard Hillel should bear this in mind as it crafts its own co-sponsorship policy. In the name of free and open discourse, it should discard Hillel International’s rules, save one: the ban on speakers and organizations that support BDS, a movement whose golemish Jew-hatred would be apparent to anyone, even the schlemiels of Chelm.
BDS is rejectionism repackaged as anti-occupation activism. Like Arafat and Nasser, the movement denies a Jewish right to self-determination. BDS, however, avoids “drive them into the sea” declamation, seeking to destroy Israel by delegitimizing its cultural, commercial, and intellectual life. Not that it takes a tzadik to find explicit anti-Semitism within the movement. Just visit its website, like I did. One prominently featured item was titled, “Zionism and Antisemitism: Racist Political Twins,” and it accused Zionists of Nazi collaboration. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of BDS’s leading lights, said that by continuing the occupation of the West Bank, Jews “refused to listen” to God, as in times past when they “disobeye[d]” him, a poorly veiled reference to the crucifixion of Christ, the basis of Christian anti-Semitism.
One could argue that the international BDS movement and its Harvard affiliate, the Palestine Solidarity Committee, are not closely associated. But that’s not true. I attended—and walked out of—the event P.J.A. was prevented from hosting at Hillel, the spark of this entire controversy. Called “Jewish Voices Against the Occupation” and co-sponsored with P.S.C., the discussion quickly degenerated into a tirade against the Jewish state, which was charged with accusations of apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. The first two claims are inaccurate. The third invokes the specter of the Holocaust, a vile comparison with anti-Semitic undertones.
The materials on P.S.C.’s website are more troubling, specifically the organization’s Veritas Handbook. Billed as “a guide to understanding the struggle for Palestinian human rights,” its 347 pages, each stamped with the international BDS logo, are ahistorical propaganda filled with glib dismissals of Muslim and Arab anti-Semitism. The handbook also indulges in conspiracy theories, alleging that Mossad operatives, not government-sanctioned campaigns of violence and terror, were responsible for the exodus of Jews from Arab lands.
Since the handbook was published in 2010, it’s possible that many members of the P.S.C. are not even aware of its existence, and I do not think they are anti-Semitic. However, the BDS watermark’s presence in the handbook suggests that the P.S.C. supports a Jew-bashing organization and subscribes to a narrative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shot through with anti-Semitism. As P.J.A. has observed, many Palestinian groups support international BDS, which means that Hillel’s guidelines effectively exclude the Palestinian perspective.
That’s not our fault. Pluralism has limits, and Hillel should not accommodate hate. If P.S.C. truly values dialogue, it must reject the anti-Semitism in its midst.

Following this month’s spring rush season, Harvard’s three fraternities have accepted a handful of new pledges from a competitive pool of would-be brothers.
Sigma Chi accepted 11 new pledges—just over 10 percent of the 107 men who rushed this month—according to president Daniel J. Zangri ’14. Alpha Epsilon Pi has taken on less than 20 percent of its rushes, accepting six new pledges from a pool of between 30 to 35 men, according to president Evan A. Ribot ’14. The president, vice president, and treasurer of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has also completed its spring rush process, did not return repeated requests for comment about the number of new pledges they accepted this season.
Unlike the campus sororities, which typically hold a unified rush process each spring governed by the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, each of Harvard’s fraternities holds its own separate rush process each semester.
This past month, each fraternity held an open rush process featuring a series of social events designed to give members and rushes a chance to mingle. Sigma Chi, for example, held four total events—including a three events open to all interested men and a final invitation-only dinner—over the span of several weeks. The accepted rushes will go through a pledge process before being accepted as official members later this semester.
Greek organizations on campus, which are not officially recognized by the University, have seen significant growth in recent years. The presidents of Sigma Chi and AEPi both said they have seen increasingly large rush classes in the past few years.
AEPi—which now has 61 official members, likely the most in the campus fraternity’s history, according to Ribot—tried to limit the size of this season’s rush class in response to the fraternity’s growth.
“We just kind of scaled the events down a little bit and kind of changed the tone of events because we were just looking to bring out a smaller class,” Ribot said. “The events were a little bit less outwardly social and a little bit more geared towards getting to know the brothers, getting to chill in a pretty relaxed setting and meet a lot of guys.”
Jack C. Smith ’15, vice president of Sigma Chi, said his fraternity must limit the size of its pledge class due to logistics.
“We can’t take everyone who shows up,” Smith said. “The process is open until the end, but we do have to make cuts.”
Smith said that Sigma Chi is pleased with its new pledges.
“The new class coming in, they’re all terrific guys,” he said.

The first phase of the construction of the new Charlesview apartment complex in Allston-Brighton is 70 percent complete, according to The Community Builders, Inc., one of the projects co-developers.
The relocation of the 208 families from the old Charlesview apartments to the new apartment complex will begin in mid-June and continue through early September, according to TCB Project Manager James Madden.
In a 2007 land swap, Harvard traded a six-acre plot near the Brighton Mills shopping center where the new Charlesview complex will stand for the current Charlesview site, which sits adjacent to the Harvard Business School.
Phase one of the Charlesview development includes the construction of 240 rental units to replace those in old Charlesview as well as the creation of business units, a community center, a public park, and an underground parking lot.
After the completion of phase one, TCB plans to build 20 houses which they hope to complete in the late fall and early winter.
Throughout the process, Stephanie Anderson Garnett, the director of communications for TCB, emphasized TCB’s commitment to delivering on a “promise made by Harvard and TCB” for a complex which contains “a mix of incomes.”
According to Madden, residents of the old Charlesview site were at first hesitant to leave, but are now more optimistic about the shift.
“People are jazzed to move,” he said.
Mariano Beecher, Housing Opportunities Unlimited relocation coordinator, echoed Madden’s statement.
“The majority of residents have a generally positive attitude [of] the move,” Beecher said. “This is an opportunity to move into units that are not dilapidated and falling apart at the seams.”
Housing Opportunities Unlimited, the firm hired by TCB to handle the relocation of the residents, has held 20 community meetings in the last six months to address community concerns on the move, Beecher said.
Beecher also said that HOU is offering Charlesview residents a number of benefits, including covering the cost of the move.
Charlesview residents expressed mixed feelings about the relocation.
“We like it here,” Maria A. Osorio said. “I don’t know the new place.”
Raisa Shapiro, another Charlesview resident, said that while she was excited about the new apartments, she was not looking forward to the move.
“I’m 71 and I have to go someplace,” she said. “But of course it will be much, much better than here. For once we’ll be out of leaks and mice and rats.”

Members of Cambridge City Council signed a contract finalizing the details of Richard C. Rossi’s appointment as Cambridge’s next City Manager at the end of Monday night’s City Council meeting.
Rossi, currently the Deputy City Manager, was tapped for the position last December nine months after current City Manager Robert W. Healy announced his retirement.
The contract stipulates that Rossi will take office July 1 and will serve as City Manager for three years.
Cantabrigians crowded into City Hall for the meeting, which focused primarily on proposed construction in Kendall Square.
Despite fierce opposition from some Cambridge residents concerned about noise and pollution, the City Council unanimously voted to allow the pharmaceutical company Millennium to construct a new laboratory in Kendall Square.
In order to move the plans forward, the Council amended its current zoning ordinances. Millennium will construct its new 230,000 square foot building in an area previously designated as residential space.
The City Council’s decision ended two years of negotiations between Cambridge and the companies Millennium and Forest City, the real estate development company that will construct the complex.
Negotiations broke off last spring when the Council realized that the development would jeopardize 168 units of affordable housing. Forest City then returned to the table this fall with a proposal that would not only preserve those 168 units but also create 25 additional units of affordable housing.
“What we see before us is a very different petition than that that was filed originally,” said Councillor David P. Maher, who led the negotiations on behalf of the City Council.
Maher urged his fellow councillors to support the zoning amendment, calling Millennium “one of the top employers in the greater Boston area.”
Some Cantabrigians in attendance raised concerns about the pollution and noise that would result from construction, while others stressed that the new complex would foster job creation and scientific research.
“Millennium Pharma is not a company that makes Viagra,” psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert said at the meeting. Gilbert said his wife currently works at Millennium researching a cure for pancreatic cancer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of sixteen members of the Service Employees International Union Local 615 voiced support for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers’ position in its contract negotiations in a letter sent to University President Drew G. Faust and Deputy Director of Labor Relations Susannah P. Scannell last Thursday.
The 16 union members who signed the petition are grounds crew workers at the Arnold Arboretum, a Harvard arboretum that employs both HUCTW and SEIU workers.
Nima Samimi, a grounds crew worker at the Arboretum and the SEIU shop steward, initiated the idea of sending the petition to show support for coworkers in HUCTW.
“My interest and my concern in starting this petition was in building solidarity to strengthen the connection of the unions at Harvard,” Samimi said.
HUCTW is currently engaged in its longest ever contract negotiations with the University. While the old contract between both sides expired July 1 of last year, the terms of a new contract have yet to be decided.
When asked for comment, a University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that the University will maintain its focus on resolving the negotiations through mediation.
“The University has successfully negotiated agreements with seven other unions at Harvard over the past two years and remains committed to reaching an agreement that is fair to employees represented by the HUCTW and to employees across the University as a whole,” the spokesperson said.
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the SEIU Local 615, said that while his organization supports HUCTW’s position in the labor negotiations, it has not officially played any role in the negotiating process.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that all the unions representing Harvard workers have close relationships with one another and that other unions have expressed support during the ongoing negotiations.
“The efforts in solidarity between our workers have really only gotten better over the years, and I think that’s due to a lot of careful listening to each other and collaborative work to be sure that our strategic ideas are well-aligned,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a two-part series examining how the looming cuts in federal funding could impact research at Harvard. Part I ran on Feb. 25.
Anticipating unprecedented cuts in federal funding, researchers and administrators at Harvard are faced with the challenge of making ends meet.
The looming cuts, known as sequestration, will be triggered automatically if lawmakers do not reach a budget agreement by March 1 and could cost Harvard millions of dollars in annual revenue.
Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill this week, Harvard will have to contend with decreased revenue from federal agencies by reevaluating its reliance on different sources of income.
Marshaling the help of administrative offices, faculty members, and researchers across the University, Harvard is already exploring possible solutions.
“There are different ways in which we are planning for and responding to these changing circumstances,” said University President Drew G. Faust.
Harvard’s solutions largely fall into two categories—cost-cutting by maximizing the efficiency of existing operations and revenue-generating by finding ways to stand out in what is an increasingly competitive pool of grant applicants and diversifying sources of sponsorship.
Still, researchers worry that Harvard’s cost-cutting efforts may jeopardize their work and fear that Harvard’s revenue generating measures, particularly private sponsorship, may not be worth the attached strings.
TIGHTENING THE BELT
Researchers are exploring a variety of methods aimed at cutting spending in an effort to preempt the potentially unprecedented cuts to University federal funding. Last fiscal year Harvard received over $650 million from Washington.
One of these solutions may be hiring fewer researchers in the future, according to Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professor Jeffrey D. Macklis.
“I’m thinking that if this is the trajectory of the federal budget...then perhaps I’m going to be a little less welcoming to that superstar from Germany, or that superstar from California,” Macklis said.
According to the Office of Sponsored Programs’ annual report, compensation—including salaries, wages, and fringe benefits—comprised approximately 30 percent of Harvard’s total costs in fiscal year 2012.
“If there’s less federal funding, the entire system will be able to support fewer investigators,” said assistant biology and computer science professor David D. Cox ’00.
Cost-cutting may also take the form of reductions in significant equipment purchases. Many researchers have already begun to be more frugal in their expenditures.
“I find myself being more conservative with it than I might otherwise be because I don’t know down the road how hard it is going to be to get the money for big sustaining grants,” said Cox, a former Crimson design editor. “I’m being much more conservative than I would be naturally.”
Harvard is also looking to reduce costs by pooling together resources through faculty collaboration, according to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
“People are watching every dollar that they spend,” Garber said. “Our faculty are already collaborative, but they also recognize that anything that gives them an edge in terms of getting research funding should be pursued more aggressively.”
THE GRANT GAME
But internal cost-cutting can only go so far. For what’s left, Harvard researchers and the administrators who support them are putting more emphasis on the normally onerous task of grant writing.
The School of Public Health, which receives around 60 percent of its operating revenue from the federal government, is taking steps to increase the competitiveness of its researchers by coaching junior faculty members through the grant application process, according to Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk.
Meanwhile in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Assistant Dean for Research Administration Elizabeth A. Lennox said that the school will try to adjust its grant proposals to fit the kind of research that federal agencies are more likely to support.
“All federal funding is not going to go away tomorrow night,” Lennox said. “You learn within the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation what areas they are funding, so that you can strategically go after that money.”
Lennox said that the research division of FAS has hired two additional staff members and hosts seminars to help researchers pursue grant funding.
Cox currently has five National Science Foundation grant proposals under consideration, a high number of applications targeted at increasing his lab’s chances at winning a proposal.
“It’s already a bit of a bloodbath,” Cox said of the competition over a shrinking pool of federal funding sources.
Researchers say that in addition to the fierce competition, an emphasis on grant writing comes with risks and consequences.
“It leads you to A, waste a lot of time, and B, miss a lot of opportunities, because you can’t guess what the funding opportunities will be in a year or two’s time,” said physics and biology professor Michael M. Desai.
Junior faculty like Cox face particularly intense pressure as they try to advance in their fields. Cox said that without the adequate financial resources or established reputations necessary to take bold risks, some labs must focus on short-term gains. This austerity could make significant discoveries less likely, he said.
“The problem with science is yes, you want to have sure bets, but a lot of the biggest breakthroughs come from risky things,” Cox said.
“I don’t know down the road how hard it is going to be to the get the money for big, sustaining grants,” he added.
STRINGS ATTACHED
In addition to prioritizing grants, the University’s researchers are looking beyond traditional avenues for funding sources. Increasingly, they are turning to private corporations and other nongovernmental sources to fund their laboratories.
“Harvard has a very strong history of corporate-sponsored research and foundation-sponsored research, as well as research funded by philanthropy, so I expect that to continue and intensify,” Garber said. “We are thoroughly optimistic that there will be a great deal of interest in funding research on the part of corporations, foundations, and other groups.”
In FY 2012, Harvard received a total of $167 million in non-federal sponsorship, which equaled 20 percent of the University’s total sponsored expenditures. Fifty-eight percent of non-federal support came from foundations, while corporations provided 22 percent.
State, local, and foreign governments, as well as research institutes, other universities, and hospitals made up the rest.
But private sources of funding can bring a whole new set of issues to the table. Unlike federal agencies, which award grants with few strings attached, private corporations and charitable foundations tend to be more restrictive with their awards, outlining the specific research interests that they will support.
“In private funding you have to do what they say,” said David A. Weitz, professor of physics and applied sciences.
Administrators and researchers say that of even greater consequence is the fact that few sponsors are willing to play the role that the federal government does in basic, rather than applied, research. Companies, for example, generally look to invest in research that will deliver them a return on their investment.
“Industries engage in partnerships with universities in order to gain an advantage...not for the public good,” Garber said.
Professors added that focusing solely on the specific goals of applied research—such as clinical trials that seek to determine the effectiveness and safety of particular drugs—might prematurely cut out future advances that are founded on more basic inquiry, on which the U.S. has relied in the past to maintain its competitive edge in science and technology.
“Companies aren’t usually in the business of funding research,” said Cox, who receives money from Silicon Valley giants Google and Intel. “They are in the business of making more money.”
Vice President for Public Affairs and Communication Christine M. Heenan explained that corporate sponsors’ nearly exclusive attention to applied research is problematic because specific applied research depends on previous basic research.
“To think of a metaphor, you’ve got foundations and companies willing to fund your second floor or your roof, but not your first floor,” Heenan said.
Cox agreed, saying that no matter how great the support from corporations and foundations, basic research is in trouble.
“Everybody always looks for private sponsorships, but it’s not like foundations are going to find new money,” he said. “I’m very dubious that you are going to see either the private foundations or the companies pick up the slack.”

With the Harvard men’s squash team knotted up with Princeton, 4-4, in the national semifinals, junior Gary Power stepped onto the court with his team’s hopes on his back.
After losing to the Tigers, 4-5, the last time the two teams faced off, the Crimson had four players who lost in the last matchup score victories for the team on Saturday. However, when junior Ali Farag dropped the first match of his collegiate career at No. 1 and Power quickly fell behind, 2-0, in his match, the Crimson was 11 points from defeat.
But Power rose to the occasion for Harvard, rallying to win the final three sets, and catapult his team into the tournament finals.
“I’ve only been here three seasons but that was the biggest moment I’ve ever seen,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “That moment will never be forgotten. Farag had taken a big loss and our captain was out with an injury, and so at that time we were not looking good at all. For [Power] to come out and do what he did was absolutely heroic.”
Power said that with so many people watching the match—he was the team’s final match on Saturday—he narrowed his focus on the court in front of him and blocked out outside distractions.
“I was just trying to get back and push us into the final,” Power said. “With so many other people riding on it, I was keeping my head in the game and trying to focus on making shots. That helped more than anything else.”
Way said that even when Power fell down two sets, he was confident in the junior’s ability to come back. The coach said that Power’s fitness and mental fortitude was key in the victories in the final three sets, and that the moment he got down, he told the other coaches that all Power needed was to take one set to get back into the match.
“He’s probably the fittest guy in college squash,” Way said. “There’s nobody more determined, and if you put determination in a beast like that, you’re going to get something quite awesome. You have to have intense concentration to do it for that long, many rallies are 60 to 80 shots and the concentration has to be there.”
Freshman Jake Matthews said that Power has been an inspiration to him in his first season on the team, demonstrating diligence off the court and inspiring confidence on it.
“Gary’s the kind of kid that you know will always push you and you know he will never give up,” Matthews said. “He’s a leader and a role model on the team. He has exceptional work ethic and determination and he’s the kind of guy you always want playing in the last match that you can count on to pull through.”
Although Power, who used to play No. 1 for the team, has slipped down the ladder to play No. 4, Way said that the junior has done a terrific job in reshaping and improving his game over the past two seasons.
“He’s been working on trying to change some aspects of his games and he has been changing it to get a bit more tactical,” Way said. “He has had a tough season [but] the basic structure of his game has improved a lot. He’s a very determined guy and a very hard working guy. He’s really paid some attention to detail and he’s gotten better and better.”
Looking to next year, the team will graduate both co-captains Jason Michas, who was injured during the national championships, and Zeke Scherl. The team has improved its finish in each of the last three years, going from fifth in 2010 to third in 2011 to national runners-up in 2012. Farag said he felt confident about the team’s status for next year.
“I think nobody will want to play against us [next year],” Farag said. “I know how hard it will be, knowing that the captains will graduate. We are getting some good recruits, however, and we were much more professional this year and we will be much better and more professional next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than four minutes remaining in the match, junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating fed the ball to freshman attack Alexis Nicolia, who drilled into the back of the net, registering her fifth goal of the season-opening game. But in the final minutes of the match, the No. 17 Harvard women’s lacrosse team was unable to close its five-goal deficit and eventually fell to Stanford, 18-13, on the road on Sunday.
The Crimson (1-0) came out strong at the opening whistle, as Nicolia netted two quick goals in the opening half to earn a quick Harvard lead. The season-opener was the first match of Nicolia’s collegiate career.
“It was really nerve-racking,” Nicolia said. “We had a couple scrimmages, so I kind of just acted like it was a scrimmage so it wouldn’t get in my head too much…. I guess it worked.”
The Cardinal (1-1) answered with two goals, tying the score at 2-2 five minutes into the opening period.
“I think our biggest problem was our composure,” Nicolia said. “I think we got really nervous, and we let them get in our heads because they were really loud. It was our first game and we were on their field…. I think our composure fell a little bit.”
Junior midfielder Kasey Uhlenhuth regained the lead for the Crimson after registering a goal off of an assist from Keating in the 7th minute.
“We had a lot of assisted goals, which is something we’ve been working on the past few years actually,” captain midfielder Micaela Cyr said. “Most of our goals were off of assists, which was great, being able to work together and really connecting.”
Harvard then headed into a scoring drought while the Stanford offense recorded three consecutive goals, securing a two-goal lead at 5-3.
Freshman attack Audrey Todd scored off an assist from Cyr, her second assist of the match. Todd then netted a free position goal to even the score.
“I think we did come out strong, and I think we hustled a lot,” Nicolia said. “It was a very tiring game, and we were doing a lot of running. I think we did keep up with them most of the time, and our hustle was really high.”
With twelve minutes remaining in the first frame, Nicolia found the back of the net to bring the score to 6-5 in the Crimson’s favor. The Cardinal again tallied three consecutive goals to head into halftime leading, 8-6.
Stanford scored the first point of the second period after sophomore midfielder Rachel Hinds executed a free position goal. Keating answered with a goal of her own less than two minutes later, but Stanford executed its third three-goal streak of the game, grabbing a five-goal lead with the score at 12-7.
“One of the things we struggled with was turnovers,” Cyr said. “We had way too many turnovers, which is something we can definitely improve on, so we’ll definitely be working on that in practice.”
Cyr decreased the Crimson’s deficit to four points after senior midfielder Danielle Tetreault fed her a pass in the eighth minute. Stanford’s freshman Meg Lentz completed a hat trick less than a minute after Cyr’s goal, extending the Cardinal’s lead to 13-8.
“Especially in the second half, [Stanford was] able to control most of the draws, which made it hard to stop them,” Cyr said.
In the final 20 minutes of the match, Harvard and Stanford combined for a total of ten points. At 19:20, Nicolia registered her fourth goal of the night, but the Cardinal offense responded with yet another three consecutive goals with the shots and assists coming from five different Stanford players.
“I think we need a little more energy,” Nicolia said. “We kind of let them dictate what we were doing, so that was definitely not good.”
Heading into the 18th minute, the Crimson fought back with three more goals, two of which were free positions from Keating and Cyr. The third was an unassisted goal from Tetreault.
“We’ve been working on a system that we’ve been doing in practice a lot,” Nicolia said. “We’ve been working on when they throw different defenses at us, how to react to it. I think we have the system down pat, so whatever they through at us, we knew how to react, so it’s working well for us. We were connecting a lot.”
After two more Stanford goals, Harvard’s final point came from Nicolia with four minutes remaining, with the final score reading 18-13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It takes a lot for any varsity athlete to make his or her comeback. It takes even more to do it again. However, for junior Jasmine Evans of the Harvard women’s basketball team it was the only way for her to stop “feeling like [she’d] been robbed.”
Evans was originally recruited for the Class of 2013 as a versatile guard with enormous athletic potential. But this potential was not seen during her freshman year, as she tore her ACL during preseason practice. Evans sat out her entire first season, deprived of any game time.
Evans returned to the court her sophomore year and proved a valuable asset to the team, averaging 3.3 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. She netted her current career-highs during that season, including a particularly strong game at Holy Cross where she netted 12 points, going 5-for-7 from the charity stripe.
“We were curious to see what her court IQ was going to be as a sophomore and what her condition as a college player was going to be,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says. “She was phenomenal. She was first guard off the bench.”
But injuries soon plagued Evans again. A broken hand, a broken foot, a concussion and more knee troubles stopped Evans in her tracks at the end of her sophomore year. Facing another knee surgery that summer, Evans decided to take the next year off to heal and stay healthy.
The Menlo Park, Calif. native returned home and spent the fall semester resting.
“I didn’t need to push anymore,” Evans says. “I had to sit down, relax and just let everything heal.”
As time went on, she made it back to the floor to regain her strength and previous level of talent.
“Around springtime, I was back in the gym shooting, running, doing whatever I could to get back in shape and get back to where I was before I got injured,” she says. “It was definitely hard not to be able to play with other college girls during that time. I went to my high school a lot and practiced with my high school team.”
Her return to basketball wasn’t just physical—Evans spent her free time watching the game on television and in person, regaining her intuitive sense for the sport. Described by Delaney-Smith as someone for whom “the sky’s the limit as to what she can do because of her athleticism”, Evans credits her time off for some of this basketball IQ.
“I feel like I am smarter at the game of basketball, just from watching it and sitting out my freshman year,” Evans says. “Being gone for a year and watching it every single day, I’ve learned a lot about the game, being able to read players and being able to figure out how the game is developing as it goes along.”
Back in Cambridge this year, she’s seen game time in all 23 of the squad’s games thus far. While she puts up an average of 3.3 points per contest, Evans’ strength remains in her defensive abilities.
“She’s probably one of our strongest defenders on the ball,” Delaney-Smith says. “[And] she’s actually one of toughest defenders off the ball… She’s very scrappy…. She knows when to go to the ball, she knows when to take charges and she knows how to shut someone down.”
Still, the nature of her injuries has changed her playing style. Unable to run as fast as she once could and more cautious of hard cuts to the basket because of her knees, Evans admits a new focus on “other skills like shooting, dribbling and being able to be put in a point guard position.”
But her basketball comeback concerns even more than the actual sport. The new member of the Class of 2014 has had adjust to a new team dynamic and the return to academics. She has coped with the arrival of two new classes of players and the challenges of the classroom.
“The first month, it was a little hard, but the girls on the team are so great,” Evans says. “They make that transition very easy.”
Evans remains unique as a one of just a few female athletes at Harvard who has taken a mid-career gap year and, even more notably, made the journey back to her sport. Her resilience comes from a true love for the game and the dedication to her teammates. Evans felt that coming back at just 50 percent would deny her the opportunity to help her team in the way that her peers and coaches would want.
“Most likely for women, they’re not going to pursue being a professional athlete,” Evans says. “Losing that one year makes a big difference because you may or may not play after college…. I thought the best decision was to take a year off, grow, get healthy, and come back and be stronger as a better player.”

Welcome to "Listen Up!," Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop.
We rounded up some of your most poignant questions from last week and responded with our unfailing wisdom.
 
Q: I feel like I have difficulty making guy friends. Don't get me wrong. I love my girl friends. They're amazing. But I enjoy having the male perspective on conversations (not to mention having someone to take to events without the pressure). Any recommendations on good places and ways to make some new guy friends?
 
A: Wait. So let us get this straight. You want to be in the friend zone? Fascinating. In our experience, the easiest way to make male friends is to tell a guy you've developed romantic feelings for him. It's a sure-fire way to becoming "just friends."
But if romantic humiliation isn't what you’re after, we recommend using your extracurriculars to boost your resume and your social life. Think about joining a club with a more masculine vibe. Or take advantage of living in co-ed dorms and try attending entryway study breaks, joining your HoCo, and playing IM sports. If all else fails, pretend you're super into video games.
 
N.B. If you are having a hard time making guy friends because you're hot and all the guys you meet fall in love with you, we don't have any advice for you. This is not a problem. Congrats on your awesome life.
 
Q: It's my senior spring and I am suffering from serious FOMO. It's my last chance to be in college and I'm constantly running around trying to make sure I don't miss out on anything—senior bar, Ghungroo senior dance, spending time with all of my friends, etc. I know I need to chill out, but what if I end up missing out on something awesome?
A: First of all, you’re a senior. It's time to stop using Twitter acronyms. You think that's going to fly at the investment bank you're starting at in four months? No, no it is not. Secondly, calm down. Senior bar can be fun, but let's be real, making small talk with that kid who lived in your freshman year entryway isn't fun. Pace yourself. Remember, at the end of this semester there is an entire week dedicated to being with other seniors, and we suspect it will be about four days longer than it needs to be. You have plenty of time.
 
Q: I'm beginning to realize that I'm likely never to find love in my life. Do you know of any good bargains on cats, particularly in bulk?
Sincerely,
Foreverwithcats'15
 
A: Don't give up, Foreverwithcats'15. You are beautiful and you will find love. We believe in you. We accept the love we think we deserve. Open your heart to love. Love is around you every day in every—
 
Oh screw it. Cats are essentially just like husbands: totally unaware of your presence unless you are holding food, rarely happy to see you, and unamused by little signs of affection. Instead of a cat, get a pool boy. They're more fun to look at.
 
Q: How do both of you juggle being such awesome human beings while also maintaining your academic genius and a vibrant social schedule?
 
A: Let us answer your question with a question: it's crazy, right?
 
Have issues? We can help!
Maybe.

Love and Life Lessons,
Sarah and Julia
