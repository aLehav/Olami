After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of the release of Drake and 21 Savage’s highly anticipated album “Her Loss,” the duo released waves of promotional material including a fake performance on NBC’s Saturday Night Live, a fake interview on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM Radio Show, and — in an unexpectedly controversial turn — a faux issue of Vogue. Amongst the plethora of memes mocking 21 Savage and Drake for their mannerisms and the controversy surrounding their reference to rapper Megan Thee Stallion’s shooting, the aforementioned fake Vogue cover has proved to be their largest issue. Now, the duo is facing a $4 million lawsuit.
On Nov. 7, Vogue’s publisher Condé Nast levied a seven-claim, 30-page suit against the rappers for reproducing Vogue’s work without permission from the company itself and, in doing so, confusing consumers. The main claim from the lawsuit is that of “trademark infringement,” which is defined as “a violation of the exclusive rights attached to a trademark without the authorization of the trademark owner or any licensees.”
Condé Nast claimed that the bulk of their promotional campaign for the album was “built entirely” on the use of Vogue’s trademarks in promotional photos, which led fans to believe that the two rappers were featured in an upcoming issue of the magazine. The photo was originally posted on Instagram, where the duo, combined, have amassed over 139 million followers.
According to TMZ, Drake and his legal team were surprised by the lawsuit. After utilizing various parodies preceding the album release, it does not seem that the duo expected any form of backlash from companies. However, according to Barton Beebe, a law professor at New York University, other companies may soon follow suit. In face of these new legal challenges, the picture has been deleted from all official social media platforms.
Lawsuits similar to this one are not new in the entertainment industry. In fact, there are several celebrities who have found themselves entangled in corporate lawsuits and cases of copyright infringement[ such as, including Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Lil Nas X, Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, and more. So, it is likely that Drake and 21 Savage are going to survive this lawsuit. In fact, many have even suggested that the lawsuit will help the album since “any publicity is good publicity.”
Multiple legal experts believe that Condé Nast has a real chance against the rappers, with some even referring to the lawsuit as an “easy case” for Vogue. Nevertheless, the entire situation speaks to a larger, more complex phenomenon in society: the ease in which technology allows us to build a false image.
In a world where TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and various other forms of social media are becoming increasingly popular, the consequences become clearer with time. Of course, there are several pros of social media, including the ability to connect people and fans across the world. However, social media also makes it incredibly easy for people to falsify their lives; it allows people to paint smiles behind frowns, alter narratives of what their lives look like, and in the case of 21 Savage and Drake, social media allows individuals to create completely fraudulent advertisements for their own personal gain.
No matter how the 21 Savage and Drake lawsuit ends, it will certainly be memorable for the rapper duo and fans alike. Whether Condé Nast’s efforts against the duo end up in her loss or their loss, the lawsuit will likely serve as precedent for future cases and a memorable event in today’s pop culture

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One October afternoon, as has become habit, I found myself walking to a nearby coffee shop between classes. Amid all the busyness of life, I have gratefully welcomed these momentary, unscheduled strolls. They promise time for reflection, a chance to feel the autumn air as it gradually cools and yields to winter, and, of course, a warm, tasty beverage to stave off a caffeine-deprivation-induced headache.
On this particular autumn day, I especially welcomed the chance to let my mind wander — I had just read about yet another set of climate activists throwing food at famous paintings, and as I began to process my initial shock and anger, I was beginning to find this form of unconventional protest intriguing.
As someone in love with the visual arts, the sight of a van Gogh drenched in tomato soup or a Monet coated in mashed potatoes had my stomach in knots. But equally troubling to me was the ultimatum one of the climate activists professed: Art or life? A moral quandary as profound as this one should neither be problematized nor answered in so few words. When the food was cleaned and the paintings restored, the difficult question of art or life lingered. I had to deal with it.
I do not find this question pressing because the answer is obviously life; rather, I find it pressing precisely because I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe it isn’t. Part of what makes life worth preserving is that life is valuable, and it’s hard not to feel that what makes human life valuable is our species’ profound legacy, artistic creation included. Sure, these protests targeting art come at a time when the planet is quickly inching toward inhabitability, and one could argue that they shed light and urgency on the climate crisis. But putting the politics aside for a moment, I invite you to consider the complex debate over the values at play.
The age-old question of balancing moral judgments evokes a philosophical classic: the Trolley Problem. In the classical construction, a trolley is about to run over a few people tied to its tracks. You can save their lives only by pulling a lever, diverting the trolley onto another track where it will run over just one person instead. In the situation at hand, it’s as though a trolley is barreling toward a button that, if pushed, will realize the suffering and eventual extinction of all of humanity, and the only way for us to divert its path is throwing humanity’s most valuable creations on the tracks.
To me, it’s not obvious how we should act. If we do choose to save human life, letting the trolley destroy humanity’s finest work, we corner ourselves into a conclusion not unreasonably felt incorrect. Is a desert society that can last long into the future, devoid of all that makes human culture what it presently is, more valuable than the short-term existence of all we have grown to love about our absurd, vibrant species — more valuable than our paintings, sculptures, music, food, traditions, strolls to buy coffee? My intuition tells me no.
But it seems some activists would answer life and mean it. Some would say that a world without art would be justified if it meant humans would have a few more centuries on their beloved planet. And as much as I cannot seem to share this sentiment, I can’t shake my empathy for it, either. The tomato soup throwers are but another part of the culture I admire so profoundly — a culture that is often political. Rarities, they remind me of Franz Kafka’s Gregor Samsa who, after metamorphosing into a bug, finds himself condemned and on the outskirts of a society once home to him. They are another idea in humanity’s bottomless reservoir of emotional and creative capital, competing to survive, sustain itself, and make itself heard, just like the rest of the world.
How could I condemn such a fundamental facet of humanity’s beautiful absurdity? I feel I cannot.
To be clear, I'm not advocating for or against these protests. I know that they do not, in actuality, represent a dichotomous choice between art and life, and indeed, that they did not intend to destroy the targeted artworks. And I know that preserving the world also allows us to continue the production of art. All I mean to say is: A certain beautiful irrationality makes human life what it is, and to condemn irrationality in favor of our rational, pragmatic stratagems for preserving life, effective as they may be, would be to miss something innate to humanity’s value.
Especially at a university where being apolitical feels like a crime, we carefully weigh our options to ensure we act according to the values most dear to us. For some, this may include engaging in unconventional forms of protest. For others, it may mean remaining uninvolved. Whatever side we end up endorsing, we must acknowledge that hypocrisy and irrationality are inevitable, as much a staple of our species as the creativity that has allowed us to paint Sunflowers and Grainstacks. Maybe at the end of it all, there’s something to value in the disagreement — as much beauty, strangely, in the discord and quagmire as in what each of us views as progress.
When I take my stroll to grab a coffee, I don’t do it because it will help me in my future. I don’t do it because I won’t be able to get through lecture without caffeine. I don’t do it because it’s productive. I do it because I want to. And I am OK with the frivolity of such an act, because there’s just something about that time I wouldn’t want to live without.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, Americans went to the polls for the midterm elections, rendering their first comprehensive electoral judgments since 2020. As concerned as we are about the state of our nation, the midterms were encouraging — young people showed up to vote in force, election deniers were kept out of battleground ballot rooms, and democracy came out ahead.
With the second-highest youth voter turnout rate in almost 30 years, our generation gave hope for the future of democracy. Galvanized by the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, young voters went to the polls with abortion rights top of mind. It paid off: All five states with abortion rights measures on the ballot voted either for enshrining pro-choice policies or against reducing access to abortion, marking a victorious election season for the reproductive rights movement from blue California to deep red Kentucky. Across the country, young people showed that we care about the future of our country — and we will use our voices to shape it.
Our generation also notched wins on the other side of the ballot box, with Maxwell Frost becoming the first Gen Z member of Congress. Representation matters, and putting young people in Congress will ensure that someone is fighting for our interests and increase youth political engagement.
The continued presence and impact of young people at the ballot box is also something that falls upon us. As Harvard students, we are among the best-positioned within our generation to drive youth engagement in politics. The University has taken positive steps to facilitate our leadership in the political realm by funding initiatives like the Harvard Votes Challenge, but as we have opined previously, they can and should go further by declaring election days as University holidays.
This year’s midterm elections also clearly demonstrated the importance of voter engagement at the local level. Maura T. Healy ’92 shattered another glass ceiling as the first woman and the first openly gay person to be elected governor of Massachusetts, while Andrea Campbell simultaneously became the first Black woman to be elected to statewide office in Massachusetts. Healy and Campbell’s wins empower youth from various backgrounds and identities, signaling to the nation that new voices are here to be heard and represented.
Moreover, three out of four progressive ballot propositions endorsed by this Board were passed by Massachusetts voters. This is a step in the right direction toward a more compassionate Massachusetts, and we can’t wait to see our state implement the changes we endorsed.
In future elections, we should respond to the call for political engagement most forcefully when we witness our democracy under threat. This election cycle, we perceived such a threat within the election denial movement centered around former President Donald J. Trump — a movement which voters emphatically rebuffed. The lackluster performance of Trumpian extremists around the nation provided Trump with his strongest rebuke since 2020. In key swing states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, Trump-endorsed candidates fell to Democrats, enabling some of the best midterm results for Democrats in decades.
Even Republicans seem to be growing tired of Trump’s antics. We hope this election marks a turning point — the end of the Trump GOP.
That said, the midterms aren’t over. In Georgia, voters will have to decide whether to give Democrats a 51st Senate seat in the form of Senator Raphael G. Warnock. Warnock, a self-proclaimed “pro-choice pastor,” is something of a unique creature in American politics. Religious morality is often associated in the United States exclusively with social conservatives, but Warnock has given a high profile to religiously-inflected progressivism. His candidacy is a reminder of the wide diversity within American politics — a mosaic of political thought that we hope to cultivate further through our own engagement with the democratic process.
Whatever the runoff results, the midterms have already sent a powerful message: Parties that cannot govern themselves will eventually face the music. The American people largely declined to buy into the sensationalist election denialism that has poisoned our politics for the last two years, and Republicans will have to clean up their party in order to win their votes back. Much has been made of the so-called impending death of democracy, but the arc of history is unpredictable. This election gives us a glimpse of hope and a path forward.
The past four years have been among the most turbulent in modern American political history. These election results may show the beginnings of a return to sanity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent survey of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences revealed stark racial and gender gaps in responses to a wide array of questions, including about discrimination and harassment, feelings of inclusion and belonging, and work-life balance.
But, pointing to improvement over the last four years, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said in an interview last week the overall results of the 2022 climate survey were “encouraging" — though “not a sign of victory.”
About 21 percent of respondents to the survey reported that they have experienced harassment and discrimination at the school.
The report measured eight diversity and belonging “themes” by grouping questions together. It revealed at least some improvement across six categories, while two remained stagnant from 2018, the last time the survey was conducted.
“The fact that we had, in six of the eight categories, improvement — modest as it might be — to me was encouraging,” Doyle said. “It’s not a sign of victory, and we will never declare victory in this space.”
The school plans to hold group discussions about inclusion and belonging issues in the coming months, in which Doyle said he plans to participate.
“I don’t want to read the notes,” he said. “I want to hear it from the voices of the individuals.”
Following the survey, Doyle also said his administration will prioritize ensuring that freshman students interested in SEAS concentrations have “equal access to an opportunity to succeed” in the school’s programs.
Doyle also discussed the following topics:
Public Service at SEAS
Doyle said the large proportion of SEAS students who take post-graduation jobs in the for-profit sector instead of public service is reflective of “larger national trends,” adding that faculty and mentors at the school are not “pushing kids towards for-profits.”
He acknowledged that for-profit opportunities are promoted more aggressively to engineering students by corporate recruiters.
“What [students] want to do in an internship is a very personalized decision,” Doyle said. “I think our role is to bring to their attention the opportunities and allow them to make decisions without us, in any way, imposing judgment or our own sense of priority or preference between things.”
“Having said that, it’s clear that larger for-profits will have more developed marketing arms that are more aggressive with their recruiting tactics, and so forth,” he added.
Doyle praised public service-oriented student groups such as Engineers without Borders, Developers for Development, and the Clean Energy Group as “organic and entrepreneurial” organizations.
Research Funding
Doyle praised The Grid, a new initiative aimed at helping SEAS affiliates translate research into startups by providing funding, workspaces, and mentorship opportunities.
“He has taken things off like a rocket sled,” Doyle said of the initiative’s executive director Paul N. Hayre. “It’s just absolutely incredible, the speed with which we’ve gotten things rolling.”
Doyle said The Grid has brought a more formalized review and mentorship process for prospective startups seeking funding.
“We had a record number of proposals submitted this cycle, and so we’ve now got a much more formalized program for reviewing those, including mentoring of individuals who maybe had failed in the prior submission, but want to learn how to come back and improve their submission,” he said.
Harvard Presidential Search
Massachusetts Hall will be vacated by Lawrence S. Bacow in six months when he steps down as Harvard president — but Doyle says he isn’t interested in filling the University’s top job.
“I have my hands quite full, and I’m very, very satisfied with what I’m doing,” he said.

Days before soft serve ice cream store Taiyaki NYC celebrates the grand opening of its Harvard location, the newest addition to the Square has already lured in students and local residents.
Taiyaki NYC, which sells its soft serve ice cream — known as creemees in parts of New England — in instagrammable fish-shaped waffle cones, found fame on social media for its unique desserts. The Harvard Square store is The Dough Club’s first location in the state, but the ice cream chain’s second store in Massachusetts.
The chain first welcomed customers in Harvard Square on Nov. 21 at its “unannounced opening,” according to store employee Winnie Tan. The ice cream store opened alongside The Dough Club, its sibling Japanese mochi doughnut store, at the former location of the clothing store Mint Julep on 6 Church St. The stores will host their grand opening on Friday.
Arleen K. Saini ’25 said Taiyaki NYC’s waffle cones are “really unique” and “very cute.”
“I could see a lot of people taking photos with it,” Saini said.
Cecilia Hermawan, a local resident who visited the new shop on Sunday with her niece, nephew, and seven-year-old daughter, said she had visited the chain’s Boston Seaport location several times and was excited to see it open in Harvard Square.
Hermawan’s daughter, Natalia, jumped in to offer her praise of Taiyaki NYC’s ice cream.
“I like how they also decorate it, and how it looks on the outside, and how it tastes on the inside,” she said.
Minh Trinh ’15, who visited Taiyaki NYC on Sunday with Nga H. Nguy ’15-’16, said the ice cream is “definitely better” than Harvard’s dining hall food.
“Maybe one day we should have Taiyaki for community dinner,” Nguy said.
“I don’t know if they do catering, but that would be pretty cool,” Trinh added.
Trinh said he does not believe the prices of Taiyaki NYC’s ice creams, which range from roughly $7 to $9, will deter Harvard students from frequenting the ice cream shop.
“I’m sure there are tons of more expensive stuff that people here at Harvard have been spending money on,” he said.
Nguy agreed.
“This is probably the same price as a large bubble tea, and I’ve been seeing the bubble tea places pretty full of students,” she said. “So I think they will still come here.”
Saini, who braved the rain to treat herself to ice cream on Sunday, said she is a “dessert person every season.”
“As exam season approaches, it’s a really nice pick-me-up to get ice cream,” Saini said. “Regardless of snow or rain.”
“It’s also a great way to procrastinate,” Saini added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Nov. 19, the Harvard men’s cross country team competed in the NCAA National Championships in Stillwater, Okla., its third consecutive appearance in the season-ending meet. Junior Maia Ramsden was the women’s sole representative, competing in the 6k for the second straight year and claiming 11th place. Meanwhile, the men’s team came 17th, with sophomore Graham Blanks finishing sixth in the 10k. Ramsden’s and Blanks’ accomplishments earned them NCAA All-American honors.
In the day’s earlier race, the women’s 6k, Ramsden got off to a very strong start. The individual Ivy League champion was able to keep up with the leaders at the start of the race and started to gain ground towards the end, taking 11th place with a time of 19:53.3, just under 25 seconds behind the winning mark set by North Carolina State’s Katelyn Tuohy. The New Zealander finished off her stellar junior campaign by setting a personal best in the event, bettering her 2021 finish by more than 40 seconds and 99 spots.
Blanks’ sixth-place time of 28:58.4 set a new personal best in the men’s 10k, just under 15 seconds behind the winner — Stanford’s Charles Hicks — and more than 20 seconds faster than last year’s 23rd-placed finish (29:21.1). It was also the Crimson’s best individual finish in the NCAA Championships since Maksim Kolerv ’14 came third as a senior.
The Athens, Ga. native credited his experience competing in the 2021 Championships in Tallahassee, Fla. with fueling his impressive results last weekend.
“First of all, [it] is experience,” he explained. “Being able to run all the same races again, kind of know how they're gonna play out, get to see the courses. So [during] my freshman year, [it] was nice to run at the national championship [and] see how the process goes.”
The Ivy League champion also demonstrated consistency throughout the season, never recording a finish worse than 26th in his six races and winning three times. He started off his season by winning the 6k at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet on Sept. 10, and entered the National Championships off another win at the Northeast Regional Championships on Nov. 11.
“I feel like I was a little more consistent this year than last year,” he added. “There's a lot of variables that from last year that I was able to get under control and make this year a little less chaotic than last year, which usually leads to better performances.”
Blanks wasn’t the only Crimson runner to put up a strong performance last Saturday — junior Acer Iverson came 50th with a time of 29:46.1. The top-five scorers were rounded out by sophomore Joe Ewing — who finished in 152nd (30:37.3) — first-year Shane Brosnan (30:39.0, 156th) and first-year Vivien Henz, whose 30:57.1 was good enough for 190th. In total, Harvard finished with 474 points, 391 behind national champions Northern Arizona.
“What typically happens is you get people who get a little too pumped up, on other teams get out, and they go out a little too fast. And by half halfway through the race, they're hurting,” reflected Blanks on the team’s strategy throughout the race. “Once the hills come in the latter half of the race, they start kind of moving backwards into places. So we wanted to take advantage of that. Just run, call them early and then utilize the people that were fading backwards to get some extra points for the team and move up. And I think we did a pretty good job with that.”
Blanks added that, despite the 17th-place finish being five positions worse than the Crimson’s finish in 2021, the team had exhibited a lot of progress.
“It was pretty encouraging,” he said. “And we're looking to improve upon that greatly next year and in the years to come.”
The Crimson’s strong performance was also tops among Ivy League schools. After finishing second by three points behind Princeton in the Ivy League Championships on Oct. 28, Harvard got the better of its rivals last Saturday. The Tigers finished 30th out of 31 teams with 710 points.

Death By Fire
Halloweekend.
It’s chilly, baby.
I warmed you up;
The heater burned you cold.
Death by Rain
Hydrated queen.
I water you with White Claw.
Suddenly you’re drowning,
and I miss you.
Death by Love
Her name is Hermione,
bellis perennis.
She gave her life
to be a bouquet.
For a pre-med
Who didn’t want me back.
Death by Silence
Why didn’t you call me?
Ask for water?
Ask for food?
You used to BeReal,
And now you BeDead.
