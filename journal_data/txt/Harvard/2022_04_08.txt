After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alyssa Stephens, better known as Latto, has been in the rap game for a while now. She first garnered mainstream attention in 2016 after winning the first season of Jermain Dupri’s competition show “Rap Game.” Since then, the artist has released several albums, which are made recognizable by her trademark fast-paced flows, biting freestyles, and heavy, Atlanta-specific Southern accent. Unlike many rappers from the Southeast, Latto’s words and pronunciations are always clear, and her message is even clearer: She is the Queen of the South.
Her latest album “777,” released March 25, is a sharp contrast from her last album, “Queen of Da Souf,” released in summer 2020.
This new album trades out the braggadocio for a slower pace, some vulnerability, and a more melodic, pop-music sound. While this album is a fun addition to Latto’s discography, some of the featured artists given lackluster performances and the transition into pop-rap does not always succeed.
The album starts strong with some dramatic, powerful beats in “777 Pt. 1” and “777 Pt. 2.” The two part intro announces Latto’s presence at the top and her readiness to transcend boundaries: “Only category they gon' put me in is the greatest.” “777 Pt. 2” has some more dramatic background vocals than what Latto typically uses, but for the most part, these intro songs are consistent with Latto’s career — sharp, vibrant, and fast.
The next two songs on the album were both released as promotional singles for the album. “Wheelie” featuring 21 Savage was released in early March and was an immediate success. Unlike the predictable nature of “Wheelie,” “Big Energy” is entirely unlike Latto’s other projects. The song opens with a funk sample from Tom Tom Club’s 1981 song “Genius of Love,” and maintains a lighter, pop beat for the rest of the song. Latto plays with the popular phrase “big d—k energy,” stripping the specifically male connotation and turning the phrase into a gender-free expression of mutual empowerment with “A boss like you need a boss like me.” The track is her most listened to song by a landslide, and marks her transition into pop-rap.
Next is “Sunshine,” which is perhaps Latto’s highest-profile song to date in terms of collaborations. Featuring both Lil Wayne and Childish Gambino, this song has melodic, gospel threads and feels closely related to Chance the Rapper’s distinctive “Coloring Book” style. But Latto is not a singer, and the heavily autotuned singing is awkward, bordering on unpleasant compared to her typical powerful and distinct voice.
Both Lil Wayne and Childish Gambino give fantastic verses, but their presence on this song speaks more than their content. For Lil Wayne and Gambino to collaborate on an album together sends a clear message: The rap industry believes and supports Latto — and they are willing to put muscle behind it.
Latto returns to her more traditional sound for “It’s Givin,” “Stepper (feat. Nardo Wick),” and “Soufside.” These songs are fast, her verses are smart, and she raps them powerfully. Before the end of the album, though, she jumps up and out of her traditional style. In “Trust No Bitch,” she opens up about being taken advantage of and unsupported, but always coming out on top. The beat is slow and she sings the hook, both new tactics for her. The hook is melodically odd, but not unpleasant, necessarily. The slower beat, on the other hand, allows Latto to have a more complex flow, which makes her message more emphatic and allows her lyricism to shine.
She ends the album with the track “Real One,” which has an effective slow beat but is undercut by an awkward melodic hook. The intention to start the album powerfully and end with a softer, R&B track is admirable, but this song ultimately fails and ends the project with little of the momentum it started with.
The weakest part of this album, though, is about two-thirds of the way through the album with “Bussdown (feat. Kodak Black).” Latto’s vocals are heavily autotuned and somewhat strained, and the slow beat does not work in this song the way it does for others. Kodak gives a sub-par verse, at best, and the song ends with a soft piano outro. There is nothing redeeming about this song, and it pulls the rest of the album down.
Overall, this is not Latto’s strongest album, but it does follow a strategic and historically successful trajectory.
When Cardi B released her 2018 album “Invasion of Privacy,” she was on a very similar path as Latto. After two albums of braggadocio and aggressive songs about sex, money, and musical success, “Invasion of Privacy” brought Cardi into the realms of pop-rap, R&B-rap, and Latin-rap. This album launched Cardi’s career in a way nobody could have expected, and she never looked back. It appears that Latto has the same intention for “777.” By incorporating pop and R&B elements, she opens up her audience significantly. Her mistake, though, was failing to diversify her features. If Latto had traded one of her many male hip-hop features for an R&B singer to help her expand her brand, the expansion might have been more successful. Of course, endorsements from Lil Wayne and Childish Gambino are great for exposure, but Latto needs to make sure that her features are as talented, if not more so, as she is. Lil Durk and Kodak Black are neither.
Aside from just the quality of the artists, Latto’s featured artists have other questionable behavior. During a mid-March appearance on Big Boy’s Neighborhood talk show, Latto said “It’s a feature on my album that it was difficult to clear, and they like trying to drop their nuts on me because I won’t respond to a DM.” So, not only did some of her features not match her talent, one actively disrespected her as a person and professional in a way that male artists typically do not have to endure. Latto, just like Cardi, is no fool. She is strategic and unintimidated by patriarchy.
This album is clearly a stepping stone, but one thing is clear to listeners: Latto’s expansion has begun. She is leaving behind her exclusively Southern rap to embrace a wider variety of styles, with some attempts more successful than others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an exciting turn of events, the College has just announced that starting with the Class of 2026, Harvard families whose annual income falls below $75,000 will not be required to contribute anything toward their student’s tuition, room, or board. This $10,000 shift from the previous $65,000 household income threshold will encompass families above the median U.S. household income. This expansion of financial aid is an accomplishment worth applauding, and we are extremely happy to see a lightening of the financial burdens of attending Harvard for lower-income students in our community.
The thrill of this development directly follows the announcement of the Class of 2026’s record-low admissions rate. The timing of this notification may raise a few eyebrows — the publication of sweeping elimination of tuition requirements has been known to drive plummeting acceptance rates like in the case of the tuition-less NYU Medical School. Hopefully, this development isn’t singularly aimed at enhancing Harvard’s brand of exclusivity.
Although the expansion of our full financial aid coverage should be celebrated, to blindly applaud the University would help paint an illusion of socioeconomic diversity at Harvard when in reality, Harvard is far from being economically diverse. Sixty-seven of Harvard students hail from the top 20 percent of the income bracket. Their median family income is $168,800. At a place that could be the most potent of social equalizers, only “1.8% of students at Harvard came from a poor family but became a rich adult,” according to the New York Times.
The College's financial aid, then, while incredible, only reaches those who overcome the near-impossible odds of gaining admission without the economic privilege that evidently, unjustly opens the door to this institution far wider. We are extremely glad to see Harvard take such an ambitious step toward economic justice in one corner of its institutional project, but precisely because of this, we believe that the University surely can and should take equally ambitious steps towards economic justice in who it brings here in the first place.
For example, free-of-charge summer programs designed to extend high-quality educational opportunities to those without the economic means can contribute meaningfully towards closing the inequalities prospective applicants face in their time before college. To find a model for such a program, Harvard need only look a few miles down the Charles River, where MIT (virtually) hosts the MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community program, which provides an intensive six-month educational experience to many underserved students without any tuition. Such stop-gap efforts cannot break down the countless barriers to higher education and social mobility in a profoundly unequal society, but they are a good way to mitigate some of the issues. Ultimately, Harvard must adjust how it evaluates applications altogether to critically account for the many ways in which economically disadvantaged applicants are prevented from presenting the most competitive applications.
As the promise of increasingly generous financial aid encourages more lower-income applicants to apply, this University must also remember that its obligation to these students does not end upon the delivery of their acceptance letter. To be clear, Harvard’s clarity in setting red-lines like $75k is certainly helpful for applicants that may otherwise be deterred by the costs of attending Harvard, even if they are able to overcome Harvard’s exceptionally low acceptance rates.
However, we hope that Harvard’s Financial Aid Office continues to tailor to the individual circumstances above the minimum financial aid that they promise and do more for the students who have overcome tremendous odds to set foot on this campus. The inequalities that make Harvard’s financial aid program so remarkable also require similarly ambitious efforts to continually improve the experience of low-income students throughout their time on campus. After all, economic inequalities that can lead to all sorts of disparities in student experiences are not simply eradicated by a financial aid award upon admission, even if it has become more generous.
Valuable initiatives like the start-up grant, which gives qualifying freshmen $1,000 to cover the unexpected costs of their first year at the College, demonstrate that Harvard can design creative and genuinely useful programs to ease the difficulties faced by low-income students. For the many upperclassmen facing similar struggles, though, it seems Harvard has chosen not to provide this same support  — a mistake it must correct.
Much like Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzimmons ’67, we are also extremely thrilled about this ambitious step towards making Harvard a more accessible place for everyone. We have no doubt that this decision will meaningfully improve the lives of many families both in our community and yet to enter it. For now, we will celebrate. But in the back of our minds, we can’t help but ask: what else will Harvard do to further its commitment to economic diversity and open its gates to the greatest young minds all over the world — and treat them well even after they have arrived on this campus and contributed to the University’s brand of exclusivity and tremendous equalizing potential?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, I was in the same position many of you are in now: admitted but unsure if Harvard was the right place for me. As I weighed financial, geographic, and academic factors, I remember waiting for a sign that there was something different, something better, about Harvard.
I thought that I found that sign during a Virtual Visitas Q&A. Amidst the standard replies to questions about food, concentrations, and classes, one answer stood out to me: When asked what their favorite part of Harvard was, a current student enthusiastically replied “the people.” This answer tipped the scales and instilled the confidence I needed to accept the offer of admission.
But after spending two years at Harvard, I have lost faith in that simple answer.
During my freshman year, I always assumed that “the people” referred to my peers. I imagined that I would be accepted into a supportive, accepting community of learners where every person is pushed to be a better thinker. In reality, I joined a hypercompetitive, toxic, and superficial community.
Harvard students love to compare themselves to each other. Exam scores, summer plans, leadership positions, and even the number of colors on your Google Calendar are all fair game — and obviously, every student wants to win. Harvard’s grind culture is impossible to escape, and pausing to take a breath from your four to five classes and handful of organizations just means that you’re falling behind.
Of course, the feeling that you’ll never measure up to your peers is why many students struggle with imposter syndrome. These culture problems would be made easier to bear with a strong group of friends, but so many relationships at Harvard are transactional. People interact to get a project or a problem set done, and when the work ends, the relationship often does as well. Combining these issues with blatant student racism and transphobia, it’s pretty clear that the students are not the high point of Harvard.
Maybe then, I reasoned, “the people” that make Harvard special are professors and administrators. Harvard’s professors are one-of-a-kind minds whose work has redefined their fields. Harvard administrators lead what is often regarded as one of the best universities in the world. Even if the students fall short, these adults must measure up.
Scandal after scandal has shown me otherwise. Some instructors use their knowledge to advance racist agendas. Others use their power to sexually harass students while the administration idly stands by. A lack of institutional support has proved common. This past year, graduate students called for non-discrimination protection and raises adjusted for inflation, leading to a three-day strike  — and it was only after eight months of negotiation and a second strike threat that the administration and the graduate student union finally reached an agreement. Additionally, although Harvard undergraduates have significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression than the national average, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services fail to meet this demand.
I’m not sharing my recollection of the past two years to convince you that the people of Harvard are exceedingly bad. I would just argue that they are exceedingly average.
Toxic culture, apathy, abuse of power, racism, and sexism exist everywhere that people exist. The Harvard community inevitably reproduces these issues. We aren’t better, and we certainly aren’t immune. The word “Harvard” carries with it a certain social weight, supported by billions of dollars and hundreds of years of history. But, truly, this power is undeserved. Before you accept (or decline) the offer of admission, you need to come to terms with this reality.
Regardless of where you attend college, be ready to hold your peers, professors, and administrators accountable. Be selective with your friends, and keep in mind that their beliefs, attitudes, and choices affect you. Hold onto the people and groups who bring you joy.
If you were to ask me now what my favorite part of Harvard is, I would say the HUDS oatmeal raisin cookies because I no longer know how to answer the question in any other way. I hope that in the next two years, my answer will change.
Welcome to Harvard, Class of 2026. A transformative college experience awaits you.

Dear You,
Sorry, I don’t really know your name. Yes, I am talking to you. You, the reader. Or more importantly you, the commenter. You are finally getting the platform that it seems that you want. This article is all about you! I haven’t been a member of the Crimson for very long, nor have I been reading Crimson articles that long either, but yet, somehow you have made an imprint in my mind.
I first got introduced to you last semester. As I was comping for the Crimson Editorial Board, I had a friend who was comping for the News Board– they met you much earlier than I did. I was a little bit in shock when I read her comments, as she was just reporting the news — simply objective. But still, her name, her peers' names, were called out by you. We talked about you – about how you were intimidating and how we were afraid to poke the bear.
So, I became a little nervous about what would happen when I started writing about subjective things, things that pertained to my identity and personality. Writing on this board must come with some vulnerability. Every time one writes, they leave a piece of themselves out there. I began to take my opinions more seriously and think critically about what I wanted to put online.
The second time I met you was when I was first published. Despite my hesitancy and fear, I still decided that I would remain strong and still confront you. I was so proud of what I created; what I put time, effort, and passion into. I smiled as my parents linked my article on their Facebook and as my friends reposted it on Instagram. However, the next morning, when I read all the things you had to say, is when I started becoming progressively less and less excited about publishing.
After that morning, I became more and more obsessed with you. My article did not even have that many comments, but I kept re-reading them to see what I could interpret from what you had said. I have always kept up with reading the Crimson, but now, reading your comments became added to my routine. It came to the point where I could recognize some of your screen names, due to how much time you spend reading and commenting on these articles. And I could always find you under the articles discussing race and gender. There was an article written back in 2018, titled “Who Can Be Racist?” which was the crux of it all. 317 comments of critiques, insults, and much more. I wondered what it felt like for the writer to see all of you guys.
I struggle to decide if you matter or not, to put it bluntly. For all I know, you could be a 40-year-old man cooped up in his room, bored and full of hatred for a young college kid. Or maybe you’re some student at Yale, living out our rivalry to its full extent. This is how my friends and family would describe you at least — as they attempted to convince me to disregard the things that you say. But, I can’t just ignore you. You are the heart of what opinion journalism is — having the freedom and the platform to speak your mind. I will always be an avid supporter of spreading knowledge and having equal access  for all voices to be heard. So who am I to stop you from doing exactly what I love?
In the spirit of exercising their freedom of speech, I have seen some online vigilantes attempting to fight back against the rude and demeaning comments that you write on the Crimson website. But yet, you remain the same — consistently commenting on each post with your criticisms. So, what is left to do is just live with you. We writers just have to understand that you're a part of the package. I get to say my piece, you get yours. Oddly enough, this is an appreciation letter. I appreciate those of you who actually provide constructive criticism, but I also appreciate those of you who make my backbone stronger – whipping me into shape. I appreciate how you remind me of the privilege that I get to speak my mind on this platform as I choose. So, get comfortable, because it seems like we are both here for the long run.
Love,
Angie Gabeau

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard released a sweeping set of proposed changes to its bullying, discrimination, and sexual harassment policies on Thursday — including drafts of the first school-wide non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies.
The proposed policy changes, sent to Harvard affiliates on Thursday by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, come 14 months after the school convened a set of working groups tasked with reviewing the school’s policies governing discrimination and harassment complaints.
The working groups proposed new University-wide policies defining non-discrimination and anti-bullying and laid out resolution procedures for the first time. They also recommended that Harvard update its definition of consent to require “active, mutual agreement” in its Title IX and sexual misconduct policies.
The working groups were comprised of Harvard faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduates as part of a “community-driven effort to examine how we address discrimination and harassment at Harvard,” Garber wrote last January.
Three of the working groups — the Title IX Policy and Other Sexual Misconduct Policy Working Group, the Non-Discrimination Policy Working Group, and the Anti-Bullying Policy Working Group — developed separate reports and submitted them to a steering committee last summer.
The groups were overseen by a steering committee made up of 15 faculty and top administrators responsible for synthesizing recommendations into a report for President Lawrence S. Bacow, Garber, and the deans of Harvard’s 11 schools.
All four reports were submitted to Harvard administrators fall 2021.
Currently, Harvard’s non-discrimination policy covers several identifying categories protected under federal and state law, including race, religion, and national origin. It does not cover disability issues, which would be processed by the University Disability Resource Center Grievance Policy, or sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination, which falls under the Title IX and other sexual misconduct policies.
The proposed new policy defines discrimination broadly as “adverse treatement of an individual based on one or more of the protected characteristics listed in this policy.” It goes on to specify two main forms: discriminatory disparate treatment and discriminatory harassment — singling out individuals for less favorable treatment and offensive conduct, respectively.
The proposed anti-bullying policy does not limit its protections to specific categories, serving instead to fill in gaps left by other policies. The policy would define bullying as “harmful interpersonal aggression by words or actions that humiliate, degrade, demean, intimidate, and/or threaten” individuals.
Both new proposed policies would include informal and formal resolution processes.
“When appropriate and possible, members of the Harvard community are encouraged to speak directly with one another about any concerns,” both policies read, adding that individual schools and work units as well as the Harvard University Ombuds Office have resources for informal resolution.
Under both policies, anonymity would only be an option under informal avenues.
To file a formal complaint under either policy, a complainant would have to notify “Local Designated Resources” — point people in specific schools and units individuals can reach out to — or the “Central Office” overseeing non-discrimination and anti-bullying procedures.
Both proposed policies recommended a central office to handle complaints, but offered few details about what the entity might look like.
Under the new proposed policies, once a complaint is filed, the Local Designated Resource would review the complaint. If the complaint proceeds, the Local Designated Resource would assign a Harvard-trained investigator to organize a full investigation and submit a final report to a panel, which would make a final determination. At least one of the panelists would have to come from outside of the school involved.
Parties may appeal decisions to the Local Designated Resources or the central office.
The working groups recommended that Harvard adopt a new definition of consent requiring an “active, mutual agreement” — as opposed to its former definition of “assent, approval, or permission.”
The rollout of the University’s sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination policies will be partially dependent on the Biden administration’s announcement of new Title IX reforms, which are expected later this month. The administration previously said it would revisit Trump-era procedures on sexual misconduct — including a controversial feature requiring schools to allow respondents and their representatives to cross-examine complainants.
The University will now commence a “comment phase” in which Harvard affiliates will be able to provide feedback on the new policies, per Garber’s Thursday announcement. The phase will be open until the end of September.
After the comment period closes, school deans and University administrators will finalize the policies before forwarding them to the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — for a vote, according to Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Garber wrote in Thursday’s announcement that he hopes input from Harvard affiliates will strengthen the drafted policies.
“There will be a wide range of views about how best to approach such important and challenging issues, but I firmly believe that the process of deliberation and debate will help us craft a set of policies that reflect and reinforce our values and advance our aspirations as a community,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors of music and African American studies explored the legacy of Eileen Southern, the first African American woman tenured in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, at a virtual event hosted Thursday by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
The webinar, titled “Black Music and the American University: Eileen Southern’s Story,” was part of the Harvard Music Department’s Eileen Southern Initiative, which examines the pathbreaking scholar’s impact in helping form the Black music studies field.
The event featured Georgia State University professor Marva Griffin Carter, University of Pennsylvania professor Guthrie P. Ramsey Jr., and Yale University professor Braxton D. Shelley. Harvard Music professor Carol J. Oja moderated the webinar, which included a brief tour of the Eileen Southern digital exhibition.
Southern, a musician and scholar focused on Black folk music, was the first Black woman in the country to earn a Ph.D. in musicology. At the event, Oja said Southern’s landmark 1971 book “The Music of Black Americans” helped jumpstart Black music studies as a field of study.
“Eileen Southern laid the groundwork for the future studies,” Ramsey said. “If you had to get a lecture together, you start with Southern.”
But Southern’s work was disparaged at the time, according to Carter.
“It was believed there was nothing to be learned beyond Jazz, perhaps, in a course,” she said.
However, Carter added, Southern’s work proved that untrue.
“She sort of dared to lead the way, as opposed to being worried about doing what was in fashion and following the scholarly modes of her day,” Oja said in an interview. “And that’s crucial for any scholar to follow one’s own vision and have the courage to do so.”
Southern came to Harvard in the mid-1970s, where she taught classes in the Afro-American Studies Department. In 1976, she became the second chair of the department, now called the African and African American Studies Department. She was the first Black woman tenured in Harvard’s FAS.
Oja said very little of Southern's legacy at the school has been preserved.
“When I arrived at Harvard in 2003, I was just puzzled because there was just no trace of her anywhere,” she said.
This spurred Oja and other members of the Music Department to launch the initiative honoring her impact.
“While I think she’s being honored much later than she should have been, it’s still very gratifying to see it happening now,” Ramsey said in an interview.

Paul G. Stainier ’18 found a home at Harvard participating in the College’s Dorm Crew — a program that previously hired students to clean dorm bathrooms.
“Everyone in the room is down to stick their hand into a toilet for money. And that, I thought, was a nice filter for people that I would get along with,” he said of his coworkers.
Stainier went on to become a House Captain, a leadership role in which he oversaw a team of student workers responsible for cleaning Cabot House.
The College began hiring undergraduates to do custodial work in dorms in 1951 through the Student Porter Program, which provided a new source of on-campus employment.
Prior to Covid-19, administrators decided to devise a shift in the function of Dorm Crew, a longtime magnet for controversy. According to organization leaders, administrators had said they wanted students to be responsible for cleaning their own spaces.
Dorm Crew leaders started planning to phase out custodial work in spring 2020 and put together a proposal of new ways to employ members on campus.
That spring, Covid-19 struck. Since then, Dorm Crew’s work has largely halted.
Now, after a 70-year history defined by cleaning bathrooms, Harvard is rolling out a new future for Dorm Crew — one that no longer involves toilets.
When applying to business school, Jose I. Garcia ’19 emphasized the leadership experience he gained as a Dorm Crew House Captain.
“Leadership roles have real consequences, and it’s not to say that Dorm Crew didn’t have real consequences, but it was a safe place to learn what leadership is,” Garcia said.
Most students first heard about Dorm Crew through Fall Clean-Up, the only freshman pre-orientation program to pay its 200 to 300 annual participants. Through FCU, incoming freshmen spent the week before move-in cleaning dorms for $13.50 per hour.
At the conclusion of FCU, students were encouraged to join Dorm Crew, which paid entry-level bathroom cleaners $16.25 per hour for a minimum of two hours per week. Students could also participate in Spring Clean-Up, which paid them to clean dorms and prepare campus for Commencement in May.
Dorm Crew employed more than 800 students per year through its various programs, according to its website.
FCU participant Guillaume Bouchard ’23-’24 wrote in an email that their days in the program were some of their “happiest and most meaningful yet.”
Bouchard, a first-generation, low-income international student, said the work helped them apply for a Social Security Number and supplement their financial aid package.
“I met there some of the most down-to-earth, genuine people I’ve known in my time at Harvard,” Bouchard wrote. “The work was rarely difficult, the company was wonderful, and the paycheck was a great way to start the year.”
Benjamin E. Frimodig ’21, who presided over the organization as a Head Captain, said Dorm Crew helped him find like-minded friends on campus.
“I came to Harvard, and it was an overwhelming place,” Frimodig said. “To be a part of a community of people at the most prestigious institution in the world that were willing to clean bathrooms to pay their way through college was such a gift.”
Despite glowing reports from many of its members, Dorm Crew has drawn criticism from some academics and undergrads who contend the program exacerbates inequities between low-income students and their peers.
In 2019, Anthony A. Jack, an assistant professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, published “The Privileged Poor,” a book that criticizes programs like FCU for furthering divisions between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University, sparked heated debate in 2019 when she tweeted about the program.
“Low-income students at HARVARD working 20 hours a week in their first year of college cleaning goddamn dorms??” Goldrick-Rab wrote.
Hrolfur Eyjolfsson ’23, who has not participated in Dorm Crew, said he finds the idea of the program “uncomfortable” and “sort of belittling.”
“I know someone that would come into my room, and they’d come there to clean the toilet as I’m just sitting on the couch. It was super awkward,” Eyjolfsson said.
Still, many current and former Dorm Crew members pushed back on these criticisms.
Head Captain Magdalen M. Mercado ’22-’23 said she believes the program actually alleviates socioeconomic differences.
“It’s a way to increase your access to things, to put money in your pocket, and to also give you access to this huge network of students and alumni,” Mercado said.
To Frimodig, criticism of Dorm Crew stems from the “elitist” stigmatization of custodial work at Harvard.
“I never appreciated as a Dorm Crew employee being informed of my own oppression by people who had never done Dorm Crew and people who had never engaged in manual labor,” he said. “I think there was a notion that Harvard students are above custodial work, which is not true.”
When the pandemic hit in 2020, Dorm Crew paused. But even with the return to full residential capacity last fall, Dorm Crew employees have been consigned to fulfilling work orders for Yard Operations and completing odd jobs during move-in.
“It felt like the College was really using Covid as an excuse to curtail the program, and that their true motives were a little bit more based in some of the bad press that Dorm Crew had gotten,” Frimodig said.
Frimodig said he felt there was “dishonest communication” from the administration during the pandemic regarding the future of Dorm Crew.
“We responded to every curveball that the pandemic threw us and that the College administrators threw us, and we just felt like it kind of ended in a lot of platitudes from them,” Frimodig said. “Just a lot of empty promises and frustrating messaging.”
In the absence of steady hours, many Dorm Crew members, like Naomi Davy ’22, have opted to take up new on-campus jobs.
“I’m now a rep in the Office of Sustainability, and I really like that job,” Davy said. “But I don’t think I would have actually taken that job if Dorm Crew was still around. I really enjoyed it.”
Former Dorm Crew member Ryan J. Golemme ’23 said he believes maintaining the program is not a priority for Harvard and fears for a loss of institutional memory.
“The longer that we’re waiting for [Dorm Crew’s return], the more of that institutional knowledge is lost, and the harder it’s going to be for us to re-form again,” Golemme said. “To be honest, I think Harvard kind of knows that.”
Harvard spokesperson Michael Conner declined to comment on student criticisms.
According to Mercado, students will not have the opportunity to take part in Spring Clean-Up as normal this year.
In early 2020, Dorm Crew Head Captains wrote a 17-page “Strategic Plan” outlining a future for the program beyond bathroom cleaning — which made up the majority of Dorm Crew’s work.
Mercado said that in finding a new direction for their organization, it was important to maintain opportunities for “meaningful, accessible, flexible student employment.”
Previously an initiative of Harvard Campus Services, Dorm Crew found a new home on campus this semester under Education Support Services. ESS encompasses the Language Center, teaching and learning support, and event and media production.
Language Center director Andrew F. Ross, who will oversee Dorm Crew, said ESS is “enormously excited” about their new relationship with the organization.
“What’s of great interest to us is Dorm Crew’s long-standing ability to self-organize and to recruit and to train student leadership,” Ross said. “Our intention, really, for this semester is to ensure Dorm Crew’s continuity, first and foremost.”
As early as next fall, some Dorm Crew members will begin doing audiovisual work for residential houses and in some classrooms across Harvard, Ross said.
But former Head Captain Daniel I. Mendoza ’21 worries that without custodial work, there will be fewer opportunities for flexible and high-paying employment for Dorm Crew employees.
In spring 2020, Dorm Crew hired 150 students for term-time work. But, according to Ross, ESS could only hire as many as 45 students if each works 10 hours a week.
Mendoza said it is difficult to imagine Dorm Crew changing, but he is optimistic about the organization’s future under ESS.
“They’re going to keep that spirit of Dorm Crew, even though it might not look the same,” Mendoza said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kennedy School lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92 and Rutgers University associate professor Noura Erakat discussed power and decolonization in Palestine and Israel in a virtual conversation hosted by the Divinity School on Wednesday.
The event was a part of a series hosted by the Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative at the Divinity School, where Erakat is a fellow. Hilary Rantisi, the associate director of the initiative, introduced the speakers.
Ganz kicked off the discussion by questioning how people mobilize around their struggles. He responded to his own question by referring to the teachings of the Protestant theologian Walter Brueggemann, who wrote about the relationship between criticality and hope.
“One, [Brueggemann] calls criticality, which is a clear view of the world’s need, of its pain, of its hurt, coupled with hope — that sense of its promises, possibilities — and that one without the other goes to despair or irrelevance,” Ganz said. “The tension, together, can inspire transformational change.”
Erakat drew on her background in activism to answer the question.
“My greatest education — like you, Marshall — was not from my institutions of academic excellence, so to speak, but have actually come from the ground, have come from community, have come from struggle,” Erakat said. “My greatest teacher about power was being a student activist at UC Berkeley.”
Erakat also described how her family and friends in Palestine had pushed her to engage in “a more traditional form of power” through the political establishment.
Still, Erakat said she felt that there was a need to address other forms of power — “how we’ve captured institutions, or how we’ve created cultural shifts, or how we’ve introduced language.”
Ganz emphasized the importance of accompanying discussions of power with action.
“The intellectual work of deconstructing ideas that are problematic, I think, is important. But it’s also got to be accompanied by the constructive work of building power and not simply identifying the sources of a lack of power,” Ganz said. “That, to me, is the challenge.”
Erakat concluded the conversation by calling on the audience to endorse Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions — a Palestinian-led movement advocating for boycotts, divestments, and economic sanctions against Israel.
“There is a way that you can be involved and be a part of helping us to grow more, and be a part of that change and changing power,” Erakat said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Torn between two schools, Ashley J. Vasquez Romo poked a hole on one side of an eraser and decided that the “poke” side would be Harvard, before throwing it up in the air.
“I said if [the eraser] lands on the side with the ‘poke’, I’m going to apply to Harvard early, and if it landed on the other side I was going to apply to Stanford early,” Vasquez Romo said.
Last Thursday, March 31, Harvard College admitted 1,214 applicants to the Class of 2026, joining the 740 admitted in the early round in December. The 1,954 students were chosen from a pool of 61,220 applicants — making for a record-low acceptance rate of 3.19 percent, down from 3.43 percent the year before.
Students admitted to the Class of 2026 expressed shock, excitement, and disbelief upon receiving their Harvard acceptances.
Vasquez Romo, a prospective member of the Class of 2026 from Las Vegas, said she felt her college application process had high stakes because her family members have not attended college.
“Was I going to continue the cycle, or was I going to be one of the first to break it?” Vasquez Romo said.
After receiving her acceptance in December, she said her family’s reactions made her certain her work had “paid off.”
“My dad — he never cries, but he started tearing up and he had this huge smile,” she said.
A veteran admit from Delano, Calif., Ryan D. Garcia feared that being five years out of high school would hurt his chances of admission.
“It was a little bit different going through [the admissions process],” Garcia said. “It seemed like I was planning on climbing an uphill battle.”
Garcia said the moment he received a likely letter in mid-March was “surreal.”
“Being first-generation military, first-generation college — [Harvard] was the dream school,” he said. “That was the American dream — my parents came, and that was the school that they thought we would be able to find success in.”
Julia Santos de Alvarenga, an international student living in Texas originally from São Paulo, Brazil, said that it was a “very stressful process, especially as an international” applicant.
“None of my family members attended college here in the U.S., and my aunt was actually the only one who attended college back in Brazil,” she said.
Alvarenga said despite the process’s stressful nature, she found it “fulfilling.”
“I learned a lot about myself and about the people around me, how I relate to them,” she said.
Student activist and founder of #1000BlackGirlBooks Marley E. Dias found it “socially validating” to be accepted knowing that her essays mentioned wanting to make change at institutions like Harvard.
“I hope to be an important voice for the changes that can be made in all institutions, particularly in predominantly white and predominantly incredibly wealthy and well resourced and less diverse communities,” Dias said.
“To know that they read that and were like, ‘We want her’ — it made me so happy because I wasn’t trying to shy away from my goals in disrupting things,” she added.
Mia A. Russ, a senior from Somerset, Mass., found her college application process “wild and crazy stressful,” but was “thrilled” when she got her acceptance.
It wasn’t until about 24 hours later that Russ said “imposter syndrome” set in, but she added that she tries to remind herself that her Harvard experience will be about more than just academics.
“I don’t know how I’ll measure up to these people in a classroom setting, but it’s just nice to know that everybody’s human,” she said. “We’re not all these robots who are really good at school — everybody has a personality, everybody has a story.”
Looking back on the experience, Dias said she learned to “remain confident in my capabilities, regardless of the outcome.”
“Now that it’s over, I feel a real contentment with who I am, what I’m capable of, and the communities that are out there for me in the future,” Dias said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In celebration of the 150th birthday of civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter, Class of 1895, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, historian Keisha N. Blain, and family members of Trotter spoke at an IOP forum Thursday.
The event, titled “Reimagining Our Radical Roots,” was co-hosted by the Center for Public Leadership’s William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice. The forum marked the opening of a two-day celebration of Trotter, the first African American Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard and founder of the Niagara movement.
Following opening remarks by Trotter Social Justice Collaborative Director Cornell William Brooks, Bacow addressed the forum, connecting the celebration to modern events.
“It’s a special day because we celebrate [Trotter’s] life. But it’s also a special day because of what happened today,” he said. “Because of the life of another Harvard graduate — not a Harvard man, a Harvard woman — Ketanji Brown Jackson, confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme Court.”
Bacow also read aloud from an essay Trotter wrote for his 30th Harvard reunion. In the essay, Trotter narrates his experiences working to advance civil rights and social justice.
“I will tell you that is a glimpse of a life truly devoted to Veritas, truly devoted to truth — a life truly devoted to social justice,” Bacow said of Trotter. “He was an extraordinary man, and he was a Harvard man — a person of outstanding talent that we proudly claim as one of our own.”
Tokya E. Dammond, a family member of Trotter, said in an interview after the event that he appreciated Bacow’s inclusion of the letter.
“I think that, to us, was the most valuable part of his speech, and I thank him very much for that,” Dammond said.
The event featured a panel with other members of the Trotter family, including civil rights activist Peggy Trotter Dammond Preacely, journalist Mary Ellen Butler, filmmaker and producer Lalou Trotter Dammond, Asian Pacific Consortium in Employment member Christopher Trotter Day, and student activist Skylar Aldridge.
In a keynote address, Blain recounted how Trotter was inspired to champion civil rights after witnessing a white barber in Cambridge refuse to serve a Black Harvard student. She also explained how Trotter went on to found the Boston Guardian, a newspaper she called “an important element of Black radical activism.”
Blain lauded Trotter for working to hold former President Woodrow Wilson accountable. After criticizing the president’s “role in deepening” racial inequality, Trotter was barred from future meetings with Wilson, she said.
“Trotter’s actions expressed an unwavering commitment to racial justice,” Blain said. “Trotter used his seat at the table to attack the root of the problem by calling out the hypocrisy of a president who didn’t mind securing the votes of Black Americans as long as he didn’t actually have to do anything to improve conditions for Black Americans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview Wednesday she is “thrilled” to invite Taeku Lee to the FAS and looks forward to the expansion of ethnic studies.
The FAS announced Monday that Lee will join Harvard’s faculty as the first ethnic studies scholar to be brought in as part of a cluster hire.
Following more than four decades of lobbying by Harvard students and alumni for an ethnic studies concentration, Gay launched a search for faculty specializing in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim studies in June 2019. But the search was suspended in April 2020 due to the pandemic, only to resume four months later.
Gay said she is waiting to hear back from three scholars the FAS has identified as part of the cluster hire, adding that Lee has been helping the FAS with its recruitment.
“I think our success in being able to recruit Taeku was helped enormously by the generosity of our alums, particularly the alums who came together to provide these transformative gifts for Asian American Studies,” she said.
Lee’s professorship will be funded by a $45 million donation made by Asian American alumni last September.
The FAS also established visiting professorships to recruit senior scholars studying ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration this year, with the College welcoming Vivek Bald as the first of the cohort, according to Gay.
Gay added that the FAS is currently recruiting “two or three” more visiting professors to teach and research at Harvard next year.
“The hope is that between the permanent appointments that we’re making for the cluster search and these distinguished senior figures who will come and spend time both doing their work, doing their research, but also teaching and working with undergraduates, then we can really build a very dynamic intellectual community around the topic of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration,” she said.
Additionally, Gay doubled the Inequality in America two-year postdoctoral fellowship from two to four fellows a year. She said Wednesday that the fellowship would give an opportunity to scholars who recently completed a Ph.D. program to receive mentorship from senior faculty and have “a long runway to get their research to the next level.”
Gay said she hopes once the FAS recruits more ethnic studies faculty, the scholars will help create an undergraduate concentration in ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration.
“From the beginning, I’ve underscored the importance of starting by building faculty, getting people here, building that critical mass, and then asking those faculty to come together to envision the best structure for their work,” she said. “I have not been shy about saying that my hope is that there will be an undergraduate concentration, and I think the interest is there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92, an alumna of Harvard College and Harvard Law School who sits on the University’s second-highest governing board, was confirmed to the United States Supreme Court on Thursday, making her the first Black woman in history to sit on the bench.
Jackson currently serves as a federal appellate judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Prior to her appointment, she served as vice chair and commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission — a bipartisan agency that oversees sentencing guidelines for federal courts — and as counsel for the private firm Morrison & Foerster.
Since 2016, she has served on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body. Her six-year term will expire this spring.
Jackson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in a 53-47 vote. Three Republican senators — Susan M. Collins (R-Maine.), Lisa Murkowsi (R-Alaska), and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) — voted for her nomination, alongside all 50 Democrats.
Jackson will replace Justice Stephen G. Breyer after his retirement at the end of the court’s summer session.
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.) praised Jackson’s confirmation Thursday.
“Even in the darkest times, there are bright lights,” he said on the Senate floor. “Today is one of the brightest lights. Let us hope it’s a metaphor, an indication of many bright lights to come.”
During the confirmation hearings, Jackson said she would recuse herself from the high-profile challenge to affirmative action the court is set to take up in the fall.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who presided over the vote, said to reporters following the voting process that she is “overjoyed” and “deeply moved” by the confirmation.
“There’s so much about what’s happening in the world now that is presenting some of the worst of this moment and human behaviors,” she said. “And then we have a moment like this.”
At a forum hosted by the William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice — an initiative dedicated to fostering public service and social justice — at the Harvard Institute of Politics Thursday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he believes Jackson will be a “brilliant jurist.”
President Joe Biden, Harris, and Jackson will deliver remarks tomorrow afternoon on the South Lawn of the White House.

William Monroe Trotter, Class of 1895, should have his portrait hanging in University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office, argued Kennedy School professor Cornell William Brooks in an interview on Tuesday.
“Because who else?” Brooks asked. “What other activist who’s a graduate of this place, who had such a long range of influence in such a pioneering way that can be seen in the present?”
The William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice at the Kennedy School, helmed by Brooks, launched a two-day celebration of Trotter’s life on Thursday, his 150th birthday.
Brooks, Bacow, and Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf gave opening remarks during a kick-off event on Thursday afternoon before Keisha N. Blain, a fellow at the Kennedy School, delivered the keynote address. On Friday, affiliates can attend panels about reparations and voting rights and attend “advocacy workshops” throughout the day.
Trotter graduated from Harvard College in 1895, where he became the first Black member of Phi Beta Kappa in the school’s history. He went on to become one of the most radical and prominent civil rights activists of the early 20th century, but is today lesser-known than some of his contemporaries.
Brooks believes it is time for Harvard to claim Trotter more prominently.
“Harvard needs to ask itself, ‘What can we do to lay hold to, and to lift up, and to push forward this legacy of social activism, and advocacy, and social justice represented by literally the first Black member of Phi Beta Kappa from here at Harvard?’” Brooks said.
“Harvard has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seize his legacy,” Brooks added.
Trotter, who grew up in Boston, was the product of wealthy and prestigious parents.
His father, James Monroe Trotter, was born into slavery in Mississippi, but raised in freedom. James Trotter was a Civil War veteran, serving in the Massachusetts 55th Regiment, composed of Black volunteers. After the war, he married Virginia Isaacs in Ohio, where William Monroe Trotter was born in 1872.
In Boston, James Trotter received a federal appointment to serve in the United States Post Office, where he was the first Black employee. He later became the highest-earning federal employee in Washington, D.C., after President Grover Cleveland appointed him to serve as the city’s “recorder of deeds.”
“[William Monroe Trotter] was a well-connected young man,” Brooks said. “He grew up in a household of relative power and influence, and a household in which national and global affairs were discussed on the regular.”
When James Trotter died, he left his son almost the equivalent of $1 million, according to Kerri K. Greenidge, an assistant professor at Tufts University.
Greenidge said Trotter’s family had a rich history of “armed protest,” explaining that James Trotter was a leader “in fighting for equal pay for Black soldiers” while serving in the Union Army. James Trotter later left his job in the Post Office because Black men, unlike their white colleagues, were not given promotions beyond their initial appointment.
“Trotter’s family was definitely rooted in this idea that just because you were a Black person who had some money or some status, you had an obligation to use that — and use your position — to assist others,” Greenidge said.
It was William Monroe Trotter’s status as a Harvard College student that allowed him to meet another future leader of the civil rights movement — W.E.B. Du Bois, who was a Harvard graduate student at the time.
According to Brooks, Trotter and Du Bois became close during their time at the school.
“They dined together, they went to plays together,” Brooks said. “Du Bois took a fancy to Deenie Trotter, who became Trotter’s girlfriend, and subsequently his wife.”
“They were like romantic rivals,” Brooks added.
While the two future civil rights activists became close to each other at Harvard, Brooks believes that Trotter fit in a lot better at the University than Du Bois did.
“Du Bois felt like he was in — but not of — Harvard,” Brooks said. “Trotter, having grown up here, just took it as a matter of course that people would accept him.”
Today, every email Brooks sends from his Kennedy School account ends with a quote from William Monroe Trotter: “Harvard was an inspiration to me because it was the exemplar of true American freedom, equality, and real democracy.”
“I think he became a little less sunny as he grew older,” Brooks added. “But at that point in time, as an undergraduate — pretty sunny disposition.”
The friendship that Trotter and Du Bois developed at Harvard led them to help found the Niagara Movement together in 1905. Trotter left the organization in 1907 and Du Bois went on to create the NAACP.
The NAACP, Brooks said, was “essentially an integrated, multiracial group of people dedicated to racial justice.”
“Trotter, on the other hand, thought that organizations dedicated to racial justice for Black people should be led by Black people,” Brooks explained, saying Du Bois and Trotter diverged when it came to the question of “who needs to run the organization dedicated to Black uplift.”
Peggy Trotter Dammond Preacely, Trotter’s great-niece, attributed the split, in part, to Trotter’s personality.
“Trotter was a person who spoke his mind, and he was not very compromising,” she said. “He wasn’t someone for gradualism, he wanted to see things made different right away.”
“Trotter was definitely someone who believed you had to be in the streets talking to people and figuring out what they wanted,” Greenidge added.
Trotter was able to speak his mind to ordinary people through the Guardian, a radical newspaper he self-funded and published alongside his wife and his sister.
According to Greenidge, Trotter believed that “the main goal of the press was that it was the voice of the people.”
“He really had this very different view of the news even than most people would think of today,” she said, “which is that it was completely independent and that he relied on copy from Black writers.”
Brooks described Trotter as an “activist journalist” who used the Guardian to make cases of injustice go viral.
“I would argue, Trotter was Black Twitter before there was Twitter,” Brooks said. “Anyone with an iPhone and an attention to social justice is seeing what Trotter pioneered 100 years ago today.”
Most notably, Trotter used the Guardian to organize a boycott of “The Birth of a Nation,” a film that offered a positive depiction of the Klu Klux Klan. Michael A. Curry, a former president of the NAACP’s Boston branch, called the film “white racial pornography.”
Curry said though Trotter was a journalist who believed in the First Amendment, he understood the importance of preventing “The Birth of a Nation” from being shown.
“He knew that releasing that film would empower America and glorify the KKK and anti-Black movements across the globe,” Curry said. “So he waged a war against those images.”
Through the Guardian, Trotter managed to get “one out of every two Black men in New England” to join his protest of “The Birth of a Nation,” Greenidge said.
“Many people respond to propaganda with counter-propaganda,” Brooks said. “He responds to propaganda with counter-protests. Big difference.”
Harvard’s programming celebrating Trotter will run through Friday, concluding with a conversation between Brooks and Greenidge at the Kennedy School. But “the most important celebration of Trotter’s legacy,” Brooks said, “is not on Thursday and Friday, but Saturday.”
“That’s the first day after the 150th anniversary celebration of his birth in terms of Harvard reclaiming — or claiming — his legacy,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a sluggish start against out-of-conference opponents, Harvard softball (12-15, 6-3 Ivy) remains in the hunt for the 2022 Ivy League Championship this spring. The team is heating up, most recently with its three-game sweep over Columbia this past weekend, which moved it to second place in the conference standings.
Chasing a three-peat after raising the trophy in both the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the team has moved into the sprint of the season, facing tough competition within the Ivy League each week, where each game has a massive impact on the final rankings.
Recent games against the Princeton Tigers (13-12, 6-3 Ivy) and the Columbia Lions (7-18, 4-5 Ivy) gave the Crimson the chance to flex its prowess in a number of double headers. Harvard dropped a nail-biting series to  Princeton at home, and most recently handily swept Columbia on the road.
Last week, the Crimson faced off against Princeton in a three-game weekend series at home on March 26 and 27. Harvard pulled out a strong opener, with a 2-1 win, but fell later in the afternoon, 5-4, and lost again, 5-1, on Sunday. The Tigers remain first in the conference standings.
While the grueling start to the season was marked by constant travel to play against some of the strongest programs in the country, the team has continued to find its groove with each passing week. It has found its drive offensively, consistently scoring earlier in its games than it did in the first half of the season.
In a three-game road series against Columbia on April 2 and 3, Harvard showed up early to take charge. Opening Game 1 with three runs in the first inning, the Crimson set the pace for the weekend, where they deftly swept the Lions, handily winning all three games: 9-1 in five innings, 8-6 in six innings, and 4-1.
A double steal of second by sophomore infielder Molly Dickerson and home by junior centerfielder/utility Teagan Shaw in the series opener was among the many successes that the Crimson achieved over the weekend. Sophomore infielder Kendall Jean recorded four RBI in Game 2, which marked a career high, and sophomore outfielder Lauren Bobowski also set a personal best with three runs.
With 10 hits in the second game of the Columbia series, Harvard again drew from the depth of its lineup, with several players heating up. Junior catcher Allison Heffley maintained her hot streak, recording hits in all three games of the series.
The Crimson’s impressive recent play has been largely driven by senior captain Morgan Melito, who leads the team with 24 hits and 18 RBI. Heffley follows close behind with 18 hits, and Jean with 11 RBI.
Harvard’s pitching has also been strong as of late, with sophomore pitcher Anna Reed opening and closing the series with complete games against Columbia. Additionally, first-year pitcher Katie Arrambide completed her third full game in Game 2, earning a shutout in the process.
This week, Harvard returned to home competition for a local weekday showdown on Apr. 5.  A doubleheader against Boston University ended in a pair of tough losses for the Crimson at home, 5-0, and 8-1 in six innings.
Currently, the Ivy League  standings have Princeton narrowly ahead of  Harvard to the top of the leaderboard, but the close margins and ample games left in the season will make this a tight race for the Crimson. Big upcoming home tilts against Penn on April 9 and 10 and Cornell on April 16 and 17 on the road will further define how the end of the season rankings shake out.
The Penn matchups this weekend will be crucial for Harvard’s championship hopes, as the Quakers currently sit in third in the conference.

Alright folks. We are just days away from the first Yardfest since 2019… Phew. As someone who attended the Yardfests of yore (i.e. exactly one, featuring Kiiara & Bazzi), I am wildly excited for the chance to relive some freshman year nostalgia. Sure, maybe we didn’t get Olivia Rodrigo opening plus the ultimate One Direction reunion as Flyby once manifested, but Swae Lee isn’t a bad deal either! Read on for all you need to know about this Sunday’s festivities.
What Even Is a Yardfest??
For those who have not experienced Harvard’s annual spring darty concert – i.e., literally everyone younger than the Class of 2022 – here’s what you need to know. Sponsored by the College Events Board since 2006, Yardfest is billed as the ultimate chance for the student body to join together in a day of musical festivities – fun fact, it used to be called Springfest and was hosted by the Undergraduate Council (rip).
Expect a day of fun from start to finish, kicking off the post-Spring Break season (aka, the best part of the school year) with a bang. Before the official events begin, be on the lookout for any student groups throwing their own pre-Yardfest festivities.
Starting at 2 p.m., each neighborhood will be hosting their own block parties – we’ve got the Quad + Dudley on the Quad Lawn, River East in Leverett Courtyard, River West in Eliot Courtyard, and River Central in Lowell’s Large Courtyard. Each neighborhood will have their own ~vibes~, but expect games, food, swag, face paint, drinks, and more!
After the block parties, you’ll want to head on over to Tercentenary Theatre (the spelling is pretentious, we know) at 4 p.m. (especially if you want to secure even more Yardfest swag!). Student openers will start at 4:30 p.m., the “celebrity opener” (ooh mysterious) begins at 6 p.m., and Swae Lee gets going around 7 p.m. – and then time for a good night’s rest before that Monday morning Gen-Ed!
Your Yardfest Starter Pack
In my professional opinion, there are a couple of absolute must-haves you’ll need when the day is actually here. First up, break out those fanny packs, folks – you’ll want to bring the essentials, but large bags are not allowed. Make sure to bring your Harvard ID along too, as only Harvard students are allowed inside (and there’s no re-entry allowed either!).
Once the day is finally here, DOWN. THAT. WATER. It’s a Sunday after all – you don’t want those Monday morning classes hitting like a brick. A good brunch is an absolute must too. There will be a barbecue dinner from 5-7:30 p.m. in the Yard, but don’t skip lunch in anticipation — you don’t want to be enjoying the festivities that day on an empty stomach.
Who Is Performing?
When you arrive at the concert, you’ll first be greeted by two student group openers, chosen at last month’s Battle for Yardfest. The Yard Bops feature a “contemporary blend of pop and funk music” and also performed during CEB’s virtual Crimson Jam back in 2020. Along with them will be Charles Revival – a band composed entirely of freshmen, so all you class of 2025s better be excited. ;)
Now for the especially fun part: that ~Celebrity Opener~ I mentioned earlier. Your guess is as good as mine for who this will be, but my bets are currently on Maggie Rogers, Jay Sean (again), or Larry Bacow on a saxophone. Or who knows! Maybe B.o.B. will make his triumphant debut after last semester’s canceled Crimson Jam.
Who Is Swae Lee?
So by now you’ve been through the block parties, the student openers, AND the super special celebrity guest – it’s now FINALLY time for the star of the show himself, Swae Lee. First revealed after he leaked his calendar on Twitter last month, Harvard is just one of the many college concert appearances Swae Lee will be making this semester.
Especially well-known as one half of the duo Rae Sremmurd with his brother Slim Jxmmi, Swae Lee is a rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. You may know him from the 2016 hit “Black Beatles” (aka, the Mannequin Challenge trend that took over the Internet), or from any of his many, many features that have netted him a number of Grammy nominations. (Not to mention, he was also raised in Mississippi, which brings this fellow Mississippian a lot of joy <3).
And by the way, if you happen to be reading this @Swae Lee, we would certainly not be upset if you brought some of your many ~friends~ along – I’m sure Post Malone or Jhené Aiko or Nicki Minaj would love Harvard too 😌
So, break out those festival fits, pack your fanny pack, and start downing those water bottles. Most importantly, have fun, stay safe, and enjoy the hopefully nice Cambridge weather!
