After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The group rises in unison, and the rustling of their cloth graduation gowns is the only thing that can be heard across John F. Kennedy Memorial Park. Each graduate raises their right hand and speaks clearly, emotions rising with every phrase:
“We, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Class of 2022, stand together to take our oath as we commit to the noble profession of public service. In keeping with the great traditions of President John F. Kennedy and our predecessors, we make these pledges for times of peace and times of crisis, to our constituents and ourselves: I will do no harm. I will undertake public service with humility. I will always be truthful, recognize the limits of my knowledge, and seek guidance when uncertain. I will be a voice for justice and recognize where our institutions perpetuate injustice.”
This scenario should not seem far-fetched. As Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to ascend to the presidency after four turbulent years and my first semester at the Kennedy School draws to a close, I am reflecting upon the great responsibility that comes with the privilege of studying here.
Many Harvard alumni sowed discord as members of the Trump administration, and some have called on the school to publicly condemn their harmful actions. This is an important step, but Harvard is facing a deeper reckoning. To truly fulfill their missions, Harvard graduate schools must take stronger measures to equip every student with the knowledge, skills, mindsets, and relationships they need to be more ethical, just leaders.
Unfortunately, a sense of personal responsibility isn’t an innate mindset. It must be cultivated intentionally. Harvard Medical School doesn’t toss an anatomy book at aspiring doctors and then leave them to do with the information what they will. Why not administer an oath to every Harvard Law School and Kennedy School graduate, similar to the one recited during a medical school white coat ceremony? While not legally binding, an oath serves as a moral guide to ensure future policy leaders and elected officials make a public commitment to ethical leadership. The inspiration for the fictional oath above was the one taken by this year’s Yale Medical School graduates, who were asked to compose an oath that reflects their shared values as a class. We would be following in the footsteps of courageous young doctors who are reimagining what these oaths might represent.
Policy, like medicine, has a tremendous capacity to heal or to harm. As scholars, practitioners, and leaders, we have an ethical obligation to use the skills we gain at Harvard for good — and to do no harm along the way.
I am not advocating that schools begin administering litmus tests for admission or requiring universal agreement on the most important issues of our time. An oath simply binds a class together in a nonpartisan commitment to humble, truthful, and just leadership.
Of course, Harvard’s graduate schools can also take more concrete steps to foster personal and ethical responsibility while preserving the diversity of thought that characterizes our experience.
At the Kennedy School, there is undeniable evidence to support broader curricular changes. This academic year, after decades of lobbying, the administration approved the introduction of a new core requirement for all Master in Public Policy students, DPI-385: “Race and Racism in the Making of the United States as a Global Power.” As a member of the course’s inaugural teaching team, I witnessed firsthand how students, both eager and skeptical, domestic and international, digested this country’s disturbing and painful history of violence and oppression. They celebrated narratives of resistance, came to understand the global implications of American racism, and internalized it all as knowledge absolutely necessary to their leadership, regardless of sector. After this summer’s global uprising against racial injustice, there should be little doubt that this knowledge must be a basic requirement for any program with a goal of preparing tomorrow’s policy leaders.
Faculty and staff should also be trained to facilitate difficult conversations, which increase the likelihood that students graduate less polarized and more able to engage across lines of difference. Amid multiple global crises that impact every student — and as some students feel genuine fear for their safety because of their race, ethnicity, gender identity, or political affiliations — faculty must be able to create space to acknowledge these challenges and help each of us make sense of our differences.
Harvard says it wants to combat racism. The only way for the University to truly do so is to reimagine and redesign every aspect of the student experience through a justice lens. In the scenario envisioned above, when future Kennedy School students lower their hands upon the conclusion of the oath to do no harm as public servants, a just world is not a guaranteed outcome. But if Harvard does more to cultivate a sense of personal and ethical responsibility, students will be united in their commitment and equipped to forge that oath into reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I note the obvious differences / in the human family,” begins Maya Angelou in her poem, “Human Family.” “Some of us are serious, / some thrive on comedy.” She goes on: “I’ve sailed upon the seven seas / and stopped in every land, / I’ve seen the wonders of the world / not yet one common man.” Yet she finishes: “I note the obvious differences / between each sort and type, / but we are more alike, my friends / than we are unalike.”
“We are more alike, my friends, / than we are unalike.”
That’s not a message we hear a lot of these days. If I’ve learned anything from the recent election, it’s that we’ve come to a world where the sheer ubiquity of “demonization,” to quote President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Nov. 7 address, has prevented us from seeing those who disagree with us as human beings, let alone alike. They’re people, too, but we’ve seemed to forget that.
But what are we trying to get out of all of this moralizing, accusation, and condescension? The election has finished. Now that the match is over and the court lights are being switched off, how should we think about that “other side?” We can’t just denigrate and dehumanize those with whom we don’t agree and still expect them to listen to and understand the changes we want to see. We have to listen to them in turn. And to do that, we have to acknowledge that behind every red and blue are human beings, too. It’s what Biden said in his address: “We are not enemies. We are Americans.” It’s what Maya Angelou said in her poem, that we are “more alike […] than we are unalike.” And if we look inside ourselves, we’ll find this to be true.
Because we are indeed more alike than we are unalike, scientifically as well as philosophically. What makes us “us,” from a biological standpoint, are our genes: stretches of DNA, double helices usually coiled up tight in the nuclei of our cells. DNA is made up of nucleotide “base pairs,” adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, the building blocks of the genetic code that tells our cellular machinery what kind of proteins to produce. In the mid-nineteenth century, long before we knew what genes or DNA were, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel grew forests of purple and white pea plants to speculate that parents might pass down different flavors of a trait to their children. A hundred and fifty years later, we know that Mendel was onto something, and thus the complicated field of genetics was born.
If we consider a gene to be a potentially million base-pair long segment of DNA, then what makes each individual human unique is that across all the 25,000 or so genes that together comprise the human genome, the sequence for no two humans is exactly the same. A combination of inherited differences and random mutations, each human’s genome can be thought of as a DNA “fingerprint,” driving the wealth of diversity that creates human genetic variation.
Most genetic variation results from SNPs — pronounced “snips” — or “single nucleotide polymorphisms.” A SNP is basically a one-base-pair differential between two given variants of a gene, an A instead of a G, for example. That tiny alteration in the genetic code can change one particular Lego block in the massive protein structure that that gene encodes, which then in turn keeps our cells and bodies running. Most of the time, the SNP has no effect on protein function; sometimes, it can have deleterious consequences; and sometimes, it just changes the trait, like the SNP that encodes lactase persistence as opposed to our ancestral lactose intolerance. Often, countless SNPs occur for a given set of genes; that’s how we get the rainbow of traits we know as humanity.
Never have we known more about the millions of SNPs in the human genome than we do now. The first sequencing of the human genome in 2000, a beacon of scientific global collaboration, gave us our first base-pair reference for the genetic code. And in 2015, the 1000 Genomes Project found that across thousands of sequenced genomes of 3 billion base pairs each, from 26 different human populations, only 0.6 percent of base pairs differed by various SNPs.
In other words, we are greater than 99 percent genetically similar to our neighbor, no matter what ethnicity or gender or culture they may be. This fact runs so radically contrary to the divisiveness with which we’ve considered different cultures and populations throughout history — a satisfying scientific repudiation to twentieth-century “race science.” In our biology, we are far, far more alike than we are unalike.
There’s one more aspect of Maya Angelou’s poem that I didn’t appreciate until just now. The poem doesn’t say that we are more alike than we are different; it says that we are more alike than we are unalike. In fact, most of “Human Family” is an appreciation of the “obvious differences” between people, treating difference as specifically not the antonym of alikeness. It’s just like biology: We are all different, with our eye color and hair color and other SNPs that make up our DNA fingerprint, but we as humans are 99 percent alike.
We are all Americans, as Joe Biden said. We have our spectrum of differences, but we can’t let those spiral into demonization, dissociating us from each other. We as Americans and as humans are fundamentally more alike than we are unalike, and we need to establish that as a baseline in politics going forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and the seven other Ivy League institutions have canceled the winter sports season as the number of coronavirus cases climbs in Massachusetts and across the nation, according to Director of Harvard Athletics Erin McDermott.
McDermott informed Harvard student athletes in a webinar Thursday evening that the Ivy League presidents unanimously decided not to proceed with the season. She also relayed to athletes that the spring sports season will be delayed at least until the end of February and that the fall sports season — which the Ivy League canceled this summer due to COVID-19 — will not be rescheduled for the spring.
“The presidents know this decision is very disappointing and share that disappointment, but the health and safety of student athletes, coaches, and the greater community has to be the highest priority,” McDermott told athletes on the call. “Intercollegiate athletics is part of a wider campus community and must operate within the same campus policies and framework.”
The Ivy League’s decision confirms that varsity athletics will not continue at Harvard in 2020.
The Ivy League canceled the 2020 spring sports season in March, two days after Harvard announced that students would have to evacuate campus as a result of the growing COVID-19 crisis.
The League announced in July that it would discontinue athletics competitions and practices for the fall term in lockstep with safety measures enforced by member universities to curb the spread of the coronavirus on their campuses.
Harvard invited a select number of students to live in the dorms this semester and implemented stringent residential health guidelines, including mandatory social distancing. Athletes living on campus began limited, sport-specific training in October under a mask mandate and social distancing requirements.
McDermott said during the webinar that campus safety policies for the spring semester, including limits on group gatherings and social-distancing guidelines, will inform what types of athletics activities can take place on campus.
Though fall and winter sport athletes will not be able to compete during this academic year, McDermott assured those athletes that they can preserve a year of collegiate athletics eligibility. Harvard ruled in April that varsity athletes whose seasons were cut short due to COVID-19 could compete for another season, though they would have to transfer to another university to use their eligibility.
McDermott, who told athletes that she shared their disappointment, said their sacrifice was for “the greater good.”
“We need to find perspective and be mindful of the depths of loss many have suffered in this pandemic,” she said. “Know that we are here for you and we will do our best to support all of you as you make important decisions and get through this difficult time.”
The Ivy League university presidents wrote in a joint statement Thursday that protecting the health of their student athletes and campuses more broadly guided the decision to cancel the winter athletics season. They also cited nationwide upticks in the spread of COVID-19.
“While these decisions come with great disappointment and frustration, our commitment to the safety and lasting health of our student-athletes and wider communities must remain our highest priority,” they wrote. “We look forward to the day when intercollegiate athletics — which are such an important part of the fabric of our campus communities — will safely return in a manner and format we all know and appreciate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22 will serve as president and vice president of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council next year, the UC Election Commission announced Thursday evening.
Harris and Gan both currently serve as representatives on the Council. Harris serves as Treasurer, Black caucus co-chair, and Dunster House representative; Gan chairs the First-Year Class Committee and is a representative from Leverett House. They will take office in December, replacing outgoing UC President James A. Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21.
Harris and Gan defeated the other ticket on the ballot, presidential candidate Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 and vice presidential candidate Nicholas J. Brennan ’23. Under the Council’s Borda count voting system, Harris and Gan won 1,045 first-choice votes compared to Ganesh and Brennan’s 423 first-choice votes.
The UC Election Commission also announced that the lone referendum on the ballot this year passed by a wide margin. More than 84 percent of voters supported a proposal stating that “Harvard University should commit resources to encouraging course material sharing on an open-source platform.”
Harris and Gan ran on a platform highlighting diversity and inclusion, improvements to student life, and resources for health and wellness. In a previous interview with The Crimson, Harris and Gan pledged to help in “Building Tomorrow’s Harvard.” The campaign received endorsements from multiple organizations on campus, including several cultural affinity groups. One of their campaign promises was the creation of an “Advocacy Fund” to help finance student activist efforts. They also pledged to expand their Headspace program, which they piloted last semester, along with other initiatives aimed at improving students’ mental health.

Amanda Y. Su ’22 will lead The Harvard Crimson’s 148th Guard as the paper's next President, the organization announced Sunday.
Su, a History and Literature concentrator hailing from San Ramon, Calif., currently covers the College Administration and trains new staff photographers for the paper’s News and Multimedia boards. As a reporter, she wrote about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on Harvard’s undergraduates, including how the decision to vacate the dorms impacted the College’s most vulnerable students.
A resident of Pforzheimer House, Su previously covered race and diversity and coordinated multimedia for Fifteen Minutes, The Crimson’s magazine. She will begin her term on Jan. 1, 2021.
“I could not be more confident in the ability of the 148th Guard to take on the challenges The Crimson faces during this uncertain time,” Crimson President Aidan F. Ryan ’21 said of the new guard. “They have proven themselves to be a dedicated, accomplished, and thoughtful group of leaders, and I am excited to see where the President, Managing Editor, and Business Manager take the 148th Guard in 2021.”
Reporter and designer James S. Bikales ’22 will lead the paper’s coverage as its Managing Editor in 2021, directing The Crimson’s daily newspaper, magazine, arts and sports sections, and blog.
Bikales, a joint Government and East Asian Studies concentrator from Portland, Ore., currently covers Harvard’s faculty and trains incoming print designers. In May, he broke allegations of sexual misconduct against three senior Anthropology professors, a story which roiled both Harvard’s department and the field at large. The Associated College Press recognized Bikales’s reporting last month, awarding it first prize for in-depth coverage.
Bikales, a resident of Quincy House, currently co-chairs The Crimson’s Diversity and Inclusivity committee, leading steps the organization has taken to become more diverse, welcoming, and accountable.
Computer Science concentrator Melissa H. Du ’22, a native of Short Hills, N.J. and resident of Quincy House, will serve as The Crimson’s next Business Manager after completing a year leading its Strategy team. In that role, she led projects aimed at improving the sustainability and success of the paper’s business. She previously managed The Crimson’s contract printing, leading that business to its first year of growth in a decade.
Founded in 1873, The Crimson is the student newspaper of Harvard University. It is the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper in the United States and the only breakfast-table daily in Cambridge, Mass. The paper is proud to provide news and analysis to a wide range of Harvard affiliates, Cambridge residents, and readers across the nation.
The Crimson selects its leaders through an election called the Turkey Shoot, a process in which all outgoing members of the masthead may participate. A candidate for a senior leadership position must receive at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected.
Joining Su, Bikales, and Du on the masthead are:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
COVID-19 patients with milder symptoms and swifter recoveries have prolonged immunity from reinfection, Harvard Medical School researchers found in a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell Nov. 3.
Led by Medical School professor and Brigham and Women’s Hospital immunologist Duane R. Wesemann, the study examined blood samples and immune cells from patients recently recovered from mild to moderate COVID-19 cases.
The study found that while the majority of participants experienced a decrease in COVID-19 antibody production in the months following their recovery from the virus, about 20 percent of the 92 individuals examined sustained antibody production at a rate equal to or greater than the rate during infection.
These patients, designated as sustainers for their ability to maintain COVID-19 antibody production for longer periods of time, were found to have recovered from the disease, on average, far more quickly than decayers, those who did not sustain antibody production.
“We were able to kind of identify a phenotype, or a kind of person that has a certain immune response, that is able to clear the virus more quickly and invest in an immune response that, for whatever reason, produces these long-lived plasma cells,” Wesemann said.
In addition to quicker recovery due to robust antibody responses, sustainers tended to have a profile of memory T cells and B cells — which help generate an accelerated response in the case of repeated infection — that are optimized evolutionarily, leading to an increased effectiveness in immune memory and protection.
“With the antibodies an interesting process takes place where they undergo this Darwinian process of evolution at a hyperspeed timescale,” Wesemann said.
He added that the study is “good news for vaccines” because it gives insight into how the human body responds to the novel coronavirus.
Still, he said, more questions need to be answered in order to truly understand how the virus behaves, such as why some people have more antibodies than others, and whether yearly vaccines will be needed to combat the virus.
“Why is this happening to these people?” Wesemman said. “Is it related to something that happens in common with other cold viruses, which we know don’t produce lasting immunity?”
Wesemman said the study could have implications beyond COVID-19, particularly due to the discovery that the memory T cells and B cells were undergoing somatic mutations at rates he had never considered. He said the high somatic mutation levels may be an indicator of how memory B cells behave.
The results of the study showing that some patients are able to clear the virus more quickly than others and have evidence of a superior immune response — including the development of longer plasma cells — could have implications for broader research on disease control, Wesemann said.
“This is a question that touches on a fundamental piece of immunology that we don’t understand — why some processes lead to longer plasma cells, and others don’t,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
International students said they felt “immense” relief over President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s projected electoral victory on Saturday, marking the end of a five-day saga full of anticipation, chaos, and uncertainty.
“The tension the past week I had, like I was just filling up my emotion, I was like a bottle, bottling up all of my emotions,” Yousuf A.M. Bakshi ’23 said. “And then when Saturday hit, the relief was just insurmountable.”
Bakshi agonized over the prospects of President Donald J. Trump’s reelection. He said that under a second Trump administration, it would be even more difficult for him to find a job after graduation and renew his student visas.
“It's been very concerning and damning because it could affect, like, our job prospects after graduation and, like, how long we’re able to stay in the U.S., and if we have to reapply for a visa, reapply for work permits and stuff,” Bakshi said. “And it [was] going to be very stressful and was going to be a lot of work and I just wasn't ready for that.”
Ana Breznik ’24, a first-year student from Slovenia, also welcomed Biden’s victory as it would represent the “hope” that international first-year students would be able to come to campus.
“So in a way, the victory of Joe Biden definitely represents a hope that first-years might be able to come to campus,” Breznik said.
Breznik was not able to join other first-year students on campus because of a U.S. Department of Homeland Security order that prohibits international students from remaining in the country if their course load is only offered online this fall.
Though the Trump Administration has since withdrawn the order after Harvard and M.I.T. filed a joint lawsuit in early July, the reversal did not apply to newly admitted international students who had yet to obtain an F-1 visa.
Breznik also said that Biden’s win would also change the perception around international students in the United States.
“We wouldn't be viewed as potential threats to stability or whatnot, but rather as a valuable asset like someone who you can learn from, someone who can, like, contribute something,” Breznik said.
Over the past four years, Trump administration officials have increased the government’s scrutiny of international students who live, work, and study in the United States, citing concerns over national security. In a high-profile case last year, immigration officials deported a Harvard freshman after finding allegedly anti-American social media posts on the student’s feed; the student eventually made it to campus.
On Sept. 25, the Department of Homeland Security released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would reduce how much time international students would be able to spend inside the United States.
President Trump’s executive actions have prompted students like Francesca Bellei, a graduate student studying comparative literature, to believe that they no longer had a future in the United States after graduation.
“Personally I know that if Trump had won, I’d have no future in the US, now I might have a chance at one,” Bellei wrote to The Crimson. “Remains to be seen!”
CBS News reported on Nov. 11 that the incoming Biden administration plans to implement a sweeping reversal of Trump’s immigration policies. It is still not clear how the new administration would approach F1 visa restrictions for international students.
Biden’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health documented points at which federal officials failed to take action to slow the COVID-19 pandemic’s spread in a study published Nov. 2.
The study — conducted by three teams of researchers led by William P. Hanage, Nancy J. Krieger ’80, and Mauricio Santillana, respectively — pointed out failures by the United States government to curtail the virus’s entrance into the U.S. via travel, protect essential employees from infection, and prevent excess mortality compared to other nations.
Krieger, a professor of social epidemiology at the School of Public Health, said she first conceived of the study in March, alarmed by a lack of any coordinated federal response to the virus.
Santillana, one of the study’s co-authors and an assistant professor at the School of Public Health, said he was also uneasy at the time.
“We were really well aware of the gravity of the situation back in February,” Santillana said. “It was very clear that this disease could have really disastrous consequences if it made it into our country.”
The researchers first examined the administration’s attempts to prevent COVID-19 from entering the United States. The study noted that at the time of the ban on travel from China, major outbreaks had already erupted in Italy and Iran.
“The federal administration proposed only measures to prevent people coming from China to the U.S.,” Santillana said. “There was a mandate definitely to look at symptomatic people coming from China, whereas there was nothing done for people coming from Europe.”
Krieger said that now, the United States can no longer remedy this mistake.
“It's well past the point of doing things at the borders,” Krieger said. “It matters in the U.S. internally, in terms of people moving around, because the virus moves because people move.”
Insufficient protection for essential employees formed another key failure of federal policy, according to the study. The U.S. saw early shortages of personal protective equipment such as masks, the distribution of which was delegated to state and local authorities rather than federal ones.
Additionally, the researchers pointed out that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has to date issued no health standards specific to the coronavirus, and that high levels of OSHA complaints correlated with future outbreaks.
“What we found was a really strong trend between people complaining about occupational safety at their worksite, and then death following that, 15 days later, at least at the national level,” said Christian C. Testa, a statistical data analyst at HSPH who contributed to this portion of the study.
Santillana said Google searches like “What are the symptoms of COVID?” or “How long does it last?” are another possible marker his team is exploring to predict spikes in COVID-19 cases.
The study also examined excess mortality from COVID-19 in the United States. Though it comprises only four percent of the world population, the country makes up around 22 percent of global coronavirus deaths. Santillana referred to an October study by Columbia University researchers which estimated that up to 210,000 COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. were preventable.
But this excess mortality has not affected all Americans equally, according to the study.
“A persistent feature of the pandemic has been the existence of racial/ethnic inequities in cases, hospitalizations, and mortality,” the study states, “especially with regard to increased risk among U.S. Black, Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations compared to the U.S. white non-Hispanic population.”
Ultimately, while the study conceded that “all cases and deaths cannot be prevented,” the researchers concluded that “this country — and its political leaders, who bear responsibility — can and must do better.”
With a new administration entering the White House, federal accountability is paramount, according to Santillana.
“I think the biggest failure of the current administration is to treat this crisis, this pandemic, as a political thing, whereas it is a clear public health emergency, and needs to be addressed by experts who are public health officials,” Santillana said. “I would suggest that the new administration focuses on getting a uniform and coherent message.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students vs. Pandemics — which began as a Harvard-wide task force formed in response to COVID-19 — has grown into a national initiative with branches in 10 universities across North America.
Jacob J. Ingber, the national president of Students vs. Pandemics and a graduate student at the Harvard Medical School, said students formed the task force in March to foster a sense of mutual support during the pandemic.
“There is a widespread feeling of a loss of agency and a lot of disjointed response efforts across the different Harvard schools,” Ingber said. “And so we started because we want to give Harvard students — and now students across America — a community and a space where they could come together and identify the problems that they're going through, and then try to work towards finding a solution.”
While the organization initially focused on compiling resources related to COVID-19, SvP has expanded its efforts to include a public speaker series, policy research initiatives, a public health blog, and partnerships with other organizations, Harvard chapter president and Extension School graduate LisaMichelle Pecaro said.
Pecaro explained that through a partnership between SvP and nonprofit Get Us PPE, chapter members sent over 100 shipments of personal protective equipment to Boston area hospitals.
SvP national vice president Grant S. McComb said that chapter members worked with State Sen. Eric P. Lesser ’07 to improve the state’s response to the pandemic.
“He was actually able to use a lot of the research we conducted to inform his own policymaking on COVID-19 for his jurisdiction,” McComb added.
McComb emphasized that the function of the national branch is to provide the funds, information, resources, and connections necessary for chapters to spearhead their own projects.
“Because this organization is really volunteer-run and really volunteer-led, we — as a national organization — will have minimal initiatives ourselves, but will primarily be supporting our chapters in that way moving forward,” he said.
McComb also said SvP plans to broaden its scope to address systemic issues in the public health sector beyond the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
“We're putting a lot of work into developing this organization, to tackle other problems that will probably come as a result of COVID-19 in the future, but then also other social issues and other health issues that will spring up, but really have nothing to do with COVID,” McComb said. “We really want this to be an organization that is sustained past this current pandemic.”
The SvP team is currently preparing to apply for nonprofit status. Ingber said that the organization has been working with the Harvard Law School’s Transactional Law Clinics during the process.
Growing the initiative in a completely virtual setting has been both a significant challenge and a memorable experience, Ingber said.
“Most of us have never met in person and didn't know each other beforehand,” he said. “Now we find ourselves running a five-hundred person organization together from different states, different parts of the country. And it's been a lot of fun. It's been really cool, but it's definitely challenging.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council released the results of a questionnaire on student concerns about their college experience in the coronavirus era Wednesday.
A number of house and freshmen yard representatives collaborated to analyze the 669 student responses and compile them into a report, entitled “Harvard At Risk,” in anticipation of the coming spring semester.
“The goal of the survey was to capture how students feel about COVID, how they feel about online school, how they feel about reopening in spring,” co-author Jack M. Swanson ’22 said.
The report concluded that students faced “severe challenges” due to the College’s switch to online learning after the coronavirus crisis escalated last spring. The survey specifically found that over a quarter of undergraduates reported feeling symptoms of depression so severe that it was “difficult to function”.
“Many students were frustrated by a lack of mental health support, and students frequently reported that professors were not understanding with students’ mental health and COVID-19-related challenges,” its authors noted.
Students also reported being dissatisfied with their social life.
“I'm on campus, and the on campus atmosphere is a recipe for poor mental health and general unhappiness,” the report quoted one respondent as saying.
The authors made a wide variety of recommendations to improve the student experience as the spring semester approaches. To alleviate feelings of isolation on campus, they recommended the College permit students to socialize indoors and also allow students to form social pods of up to six people who can interact without social distancing restrictions or masks.
Other recommendations targeted academic concerns and sought to foster increased flexibility. One advocated for the College to extend the pass/fail deadline — a proposal favored by the majority of survey respondents.
Finally, the report urged the College to invite back as many students as possible to live on-campus next semester. This fall, only freshmen and select upperclassmen were invited to live in dorms.
Samyra C. Miller ’21, a Lowell House representative on the Council, was the only member to dissent from releasing the report to the student body.
“I think we can be a little more critical of things that students want, especially when other people are involved in certain decisions,” Miller said. “Our recommendation to open up common spaces — what I felt wasn’t considered was the custodial workers who would have to be more exposed to the virus and also have to work overtime, because those spaces would have to be cleaned more regularly.”
Other students not involved in the creation of the report also voiced opposition to some of its language.
Jara A. Wilensky ’24 said she disagreed with the case the report made for the College to bring more undergraduates to campus next spring. This case was premised on the fact that a number of peer institutions have successfully brought large cohorts back, but Wilensky pointed out that the other universities cited, such as Cornell, have much lower population densities than the greater Boston area.
“This is not a fair comparison. It just makes the whole report look less valid and less researched,” she said.
However, this dissent was certainly not universal: some students said the report captured the general public opinion and that they approved of its recommendations.
“It does a good job and it says what a lot of people are thinking,” Hayden Teeter ’24 said.

If you’re living on campus this semester and recently learned that good old Harvard wants to yeet you out of your room in two weeks, we feel your pain. We really do. But fear not, because Flyby’s got you covered with these elite tips to improve your packing game. So forget about your stress and consider your life: hacked.
Does it bring you joy?
We seem to be quoting Marie Kondo a lot recently, but only because she’s right — if it doesn’t bring you joy, forget about it. Don’t waste precious storage space on things you’ll barely use. It’s okay if you don’t need all the free swag you accumulated over the semester. Donate what you don’t need and give yourself less to think about!
Don’t double up!
There’s no shame in admitting you went on a massive Bed Bath and Beyond haul this summer. Your room looks that much better for it. But chances are, a lot of the stuff you bought for your dorm, you already have at home. And there’s really no good reason to end up with two shoe organizers (unless you’re into this type of thing). So TLDR: if you already have it, put it in storage.
Roll with it.
Even if you’re not a STEM concentrator, you know your closet is defying all the laws of science: you brought your stuff to campus in one box, but now it refuses to fit back in there. The solution? Roll your clothes. Truly the most underestimated packing tip, tightly rolling your clothes before packing is a magical way to make space inside your boxes. Before you say you don’t believe us, just try!
Other thoughts.
Some people may consider these ~common sense~, but it never hurts to hear a reminder. Avoid storing things that might leak (tide pods, shampoo, etc.) and if you must, don’t store these with pillows, sheets, or anything else you don’t want ruined (yes, we’re looking at you, Canada Goose). Also avoid storing perishables. If you put peanut butter in storage, we cannot guarantee it will be peanut butter when you get it back.
If you’re still reading at this point, we love you, but please get packing. Here’s a playlist to boost your productivity as you get started. Let’s empty out your drawers, pull out that suitcase from under your bed, and get to work. Good luck!
