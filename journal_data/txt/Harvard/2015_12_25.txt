After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After earning its two best victories of the year, the Harvard men’s basketball team (5-6) will take on the No. 3/2 Oklahoma Sooners (10-0) in the final of the Diamond Head Classic (8:30 EST, ESPN2). Men’s basketball beat writer David Freed previews the matchup with a quick primer on the Sooners and three things to watch.
Overview:
Record: 10-0
Best Wins: Villanova, Wisconsin, Hawaii
Worst Losses: N/A
RPI: 7
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 1
Tournament Results: Beat Washington State 88-60 in quarterfinals, defeated host Hawaii 84-81 in semifinals
Star Players: Senior guard Buddy Hield (24.0 ppg, 5.1 rpg), senior guard Isaiah Cousins (13.7 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 5.0 rpg)
A quick inspection of the Sooners’ resume reveals why Ken Pomeroy’s system considers them the best team in the country. Oklahoma has not only gone undefeated; it has barely come close to losing, with Thursday’s Hawaii scare the first single-digit margin of victory for the Sooners since their opener against Memphis.
Three Things to Watch
1. Playing Up a Level — One reassuring fact for Harvard fans is that the Crimson has already hung with KenPom’s second-ranked team, Kansas, for 40 minutes. The 75-69 loss, Harvard’s last, was a turnaround game for freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy, who had 11 points, five assists, and four rebounds in the losing effort. One crucial factor in keeping the game close was how McCarthy held his own against opposing point guard Frank Mason, Jr., preventing Kansas from getting out and running in the open floor. He will need to do the same against Cousins, the engine that gets the Oklahoma offense going. While Hield gets most of the headlines, Cousins’ ability to space the floor (51 percent three-point shooting on four attempts a game) gives the Sooner offense another dimension. Senior Agunwa Okolie, Harvard’s defensive ace, will likely get the call on Hield, and whether he and McCarthy can frustrate their matchups defensively will go a long way towards deciding the game.
2. Guarding The Line — Seemingly every game for the Crimson comes down to the three-point arc. After holding BYU to just three makes on 13 attempts, Harvard limited Auburn to just six makes in 25 tries. In both games, the Crimson outscored its opponent from behind the line, sinking a combined 19 threes in the two games. It could not be more crucial that Harvard complete the hat trick: Oklahoma launches 21 threes a game at a 47 percent clip. Four Sooner starters shoot better than 45 percent from behind the arc, three better than 51 percent. Against Kansas, a similarly strong jump-shooting team, the Crimson limited the Jayhawks to just 14 shots and six makes. If it can get similar results Friday, it will have a great shot at victory.
3. Making The Freebies — Amazingly, Harvard has been winning despite a lack of regression to the mean on its free throw shooting. The Crimson is the eighth worst free throw shooting squad in the country, converting just under 60 percent from the charity stripe. The statistic is deceptive, since only three Harvard players—forward Zena Edosomwan, Chris Egi, and Evan Cummins—shoot worse than 72 percent. Unfortunately, the three have taken half of the Crimson’s free throw attempts and both BYU coach Dave Rose and Auburn coach Bruce Pearl took to hacking Edosomwan at times in the last two games. The forward made just 10 of his 22 attempts, continuing a season-long regression that has him at 46 percent after shooting 60 percent or better in each of his first two years. The tactic, used in the NBA to help make up huge deficits, could be a crucial ploy down the stretch for Oklahoma against a Crimson team that hasn’t shown that it can overcome it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a dominant 69-51 victory over Auburn in the semifinals of the Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic, Harvard (5-6) will turn its attention to No. 3/2 Oklahoma (10-0) in the tournament championship game on Friday night (8:30 p.m., ESPN2). Men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason analyzes the individual matchups in what may be the Crimson’s toughest game of the season.
Point guard: Tommy McCarthy vs. Isaiah Cousins
It’s the freshman who has played in all of 11 collegiate contests going against the tested senior who has started 92 in his career and is the glue for a team with national title aspirations. While senior wing Buddy Hield will be the best player on the floor whenever he is on it, McCarthy will need to neutralize Cousins, who is second on the team in points and leads the Sooners in assists. As is always the case with McCarthy, the key on the offensive end will be limiting turnovers. The freshman has averaged 6.5 turnovers in Harvard’s two games in Hawaii. Oklahoma’s opponents average 11.2 turnovers per contest, which is one fewer turnover than the Sooners average. Harvard has turned the ball over less than 12 times in just three games this season. The Crimson is 5-0 this season when it wins or ties the turnover battle and ball control starts with this matchup.
Shooting guard: Corey Johnson vs. Jordan Woodard
Oklahoma is averaging over 87 points per game this season and has been in that neighborhood for both of its Diamond Head Classic contests. For Harvard to keep pace, it will need a strong offensive game from the freshman sharpshooter, who went four-for-nine from three-point range in both of the team’s tournament games. That task will be easier said than done as  the Sooners’ defense has limited its opponents to 27.2 percent shooting from beyond the arc this season. The Crimson is 4-2 this season when Johnson posts double-digit scoring outputs. After being the starting point guard for his first two seasons in Norman, Woodard began flanking Cousins in the starting lineup last month. The junior is the team’s third-leading scorer, is almost automatic from the free throw line, and is one of three Oklahoma starters who shoots over 50 percent from beyond the arc.
Small forward: Agunwa Okolie vs. Buddy Hield
This will be the matchup to watch on Friday night and will ultimately dictate whether Harvard can hang with the Sooners. The Crimson senior will be tasked with covering a Naismith Award finalist, but this is nothing new for Okolie. The Ajax, Ontario native has already squared off with the likes of Providence’s Kris Dunn, Kansas’ Wayne Selden, BYU’s Kyle Collinsworth, and Auburn’s Kareem Canty, holding all but the BYU co-captain below his average field goal percentage. During Wednesday’s broadcast, color commentator Cory Alexander noted that Okolie ought to be considered one of the best perimeter defenders in all of college basketball, and the former Virginia star has a point. Okolie utilizes his 6’8” frame to alter shots and the senior’s size is not an inhibition off the dribble. Hield is averaging 28.8 points per game in his last four contests, but the senior may have the best supporting backcourt of any of the four superstars Okolie has had to guard.
Power forward: Evan Cummins vs. Ryan Spangler
While junior Zena Edosomwan stole the show against BYU on Tuesday, Cummins capitalized on the double-teams Auburn threw at his front court partner to set a career-high with 13 points. If Oklahoma looks to double-team Edosomwan, as most teams have this season, Cummins will need to convert offensively and knock down his free throws (52.6 percent on the season). Spangler leads the Sooners in minutes and rebounds and has a jump shot that can be extended out past the three-point line. While the guards run the show for Oklahoma, Spangler has had six double-digit scoring games this season. Cummins will have to prevent offensive rebounds and stay out of foul trouble against the versatile Sooner big.
Center: Zena Edosomwan vs. Khadeem Lattin
In order for Harvard to stand a chance, the team’s best player must set the tone. Edosomwan posted the best offensive performance of his collegiate career on Tuesday against BYU and will need to put up similar numbers against Lattin, especially if Oklahoma decides not to double the 6’9” Los Angeles native. If Sooners coach Lon Kruger decides to call for defensive help, Edosomwan will have to find Cummins underneath or sharpshooters Johnson and Corbin Miller on the perimeter. Edosomwan oftentimes discusses setting the tone on the glass and letting his offense stem from there, and the junior will certainly need to attack the glass as Oklahoma is outrebounding its opponents by 8.5 boards per contest. While Lattin is the fifth option offensively for the Sooners, the sophomore leads the team in field goal percentage and as Hawaii will tell you, he can score if too much attention is put on Hield and the other Oklahoma guards.
Bench
In its two Diamond Head Classic games, the Crimson bench has averaged 21 points and avoided a dropoff in production when Edosomwan and McCarthy struggled with foul trouble. Miller has played more minutes in the two games in Hawaii than he has in any other games this season and has established himself as a viable backup for McCarthy. Like Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, Kruger typically utilizes a four-deep bench in close games. Freshman forward Dante Buford, freshman guard Christian James, junior center Akolda Manyang, and senior guard Dinjiyl Walker combine to average almost 16 points, nine rebounds, and three assists off the bench. Spangler, Hield, and Cousins each average around 30 minutes a game for the Sooners. The Crimson is still trying to discover who its third big man will be this season. Sophomore Chris Egi has seen action in both Diamond Head Classic games but has not scored and has made just 22.2 percent of his free throws this season. Freshman Weisner Perez, an undersized power forward, has seen limited action since his 15-point performance against Kansas. Senior small forward Patrick Steeves has been a bright spot for Harvard in Hawaii, finding open teammates and hitting free throws down the stretch against BYU and making two three-pointers and corralling seven rebounds against Auburn.
Overview
The first few minutes of Friday’s contest will most likely set the tone for the entire contest. Oklahoma is coming off its first single-digit victory since its season opener against Memphis. Hawaii provided the wake-up call that the Sooners had not had all season and Oklahoma figures to be hungry from the opening tip. The Crimson has gotten off to uncharacteristically hot starts at the Diamond Head Classic, holding double-digit first half leads in its two victories on the island, but Oklahoma has been excellent all season in the first half, never having trailing at the break thus far.
In slowing down two potent offenses, Harvard forced BYU and Auburn to play the half-court style Amaker and company favor. Oklahoma thrives in transition and shoots a blistering 47.2 percent from beyond the arc. Even if Okolie shuts down Hield, the supporting cast of Cousins, Woodard, and Spangler is talented enough to overcome the Crimson. While Harvard is the 11th-youngest team in the nation, The Sooners are led by upperclassmen, many of whom led the team to last March’s Sweet Sixteen. Size-wise, the Crimson and Oklahoma are very similar. Okolie has four inches on Hield, but the two starting front courts are identical in height. The Sooner defense is not particularly good at forcing turnovers, but McCarthy and company will have to take care of the ball to upset Oklahoma and bring home Harvard’s third straight regular season tournament championship.

For many people, the winter holidays are the most wonderful time of the year. Watching holiday specials of your favorite shows, spending time with family, opening presents, and eating too many holiday cookies to count all help to make the season so magical. However, the recent bouts of unnaturally warm weather have definitely taken away from the usual holiday feel. This year, all dreams of a White Christmas seem beyond reach, unless we expect to see the East Coast drop from a balmy 70° down to below freezing in time for Santa’s arrival. In case the Christmas Eve heat wave has got you down, flyby is here with the holiday guide to global warming.
DO: Improvise your snowman!
The tragedy of our world slowly warming up is no reason to forego some of the best holiday traditions. Even though it might not be snowing where you live, you can still find ways to improvise your Frosty. Dirt, mud, or large piles of grass all work just as well as snow to create a makeshift snowman.
DON’T: Use the oven for holiday cookies
The Earth is hot enough as it is. Raw cookie dough is not even that bad for you. Avoid using this extra energy and just make your holiday cookies raw. They decorate well either way, and few things bring a family closer together than a shared salmonella outbreak on Christmas Eve.
DO: Turn off your Christmas lights
With global warming upon us, energy conservation is key, and yes that applies to all of your Christmas lights. Nothing says the holiday season more than a row of dark houses throughout the neighborhood, right? Luckily, the dirt snowmen on the front lawn should add some holiday cheer. If not, hanging strings of popcorn along the length of your house is just tedious enough to fill the void normally occupied by putting up excessive amounts of lights.
DON’T: Forget sunscreen when you're tanning
Given the fact that it's the end of December and now officially winter, putting on sunscreen may not always be your top priority. However, this holiday season seems to be presenting a new opportunity to improve that pasty complexion. Why not capitalize on the extra sunlight by getting a little tanning in? But while basking in the warm winter sun, make sure you don't forget to apply that sunscreen.
Even though snow on Christmas would be ideal, with flyby’s help you can still have a very merry holiday season at these unusually hot temperatures. Plus for those who simply cannot get over the unnaturally warm weather, rest assured, we’ll likely make up for this lack of snow when the spring semester greets us with another snowpocalypse.
