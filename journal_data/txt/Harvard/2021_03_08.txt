After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College life can feel like a constant uphill battle. Every one of us feels it in our fight to stay ahead as midterm after midterm hits. Most days we’re just trying to stay afloat, cranking out problem sets ‘til the wee hours of the morning, fending off the never-ending stream of emails, and juggling multiple club commitments. However, in habitually pushing to go above and beyond, it’s all too easy to lose track of our mental and physical well-being until we crash. To avoid such a catastrophe, some people read, some watch Netflix, some nap. My strategy? I run.
I always hated running. Even as a kid, cross-country felt like torture — the monotony of running around and around a track, or worse, to nowhere on a treadmill was unbearable. Now? I run a 5k twice a week — both a feat and a sign of an identity crisis in the eyes of my younger self. She’d ask the same question you’re probably asking: Why would I ever run?
On especially early mornings I ask myself this too. But for me, running is more than just a self-care habit, and while baths, skincare, and seeing friends all renew my energy, none make me feel as incredibly alive and powerful as running does.
There’s truly nothing like the wave of a runner’s high that swells up mid-way through — akin to an adrenaline rush and stretching a sore muscle at once. This feeling drowns out the rest of the world, allowing me a brief respite in which the path to success is clear and immediately achievable.
Achievement runs our lives — no pun intended — no matter how hard we might try to escape or deny it. The pressures of being the best, the first, the straight-A student are, for me at least, subconscious demands that must be met at every moment. This unhealthy dependence on external achievements can be detrimental to our development as individuals, but in their unavoidability, our only option is to prioritize personal goals alongside them. Exercising our abilities beyond learning, finding and nurturing our inner passions without external motivations, is the only way to ensure we can become holistic and self-conscious individuals. Running is my chosen form of growth: a space where I can push myself to go a little further, a little harder than the day before, and when I succeed, feel proud.
Running not only drives me to work harder but also keeps any negativity at bay. Stress and worry slowly but surely creep up to the doors of our minds, knocking at them to enter and destroy the fragile balance of our lives. When I run, the knocking recedes, my thoughts reduced to the beat of the music, the wind on my face, and the pound of my feet against the cracked Cambridge pavement.
Using my brain for one thing and one thing only is an immeasurable relief that has kept me grounded through life’s busiest moments. More than this, blocking off personal time in my routine keeps the world varied and exciting, helping me find passion in the deluge of work to be done and reminding me to find joy in the challenge. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of responsibilities, but my jogs are a life preserver — keeping my head above the water so I never feel close to drowning.
Taking the time to do things that empower us, that remind us of how alive we are, is the single most important form of self-care. Though each impending midterm may seem to move the finish line further and further away, we owe it to ourselves to make our personal health a priority. Saving time for internal growth is the only way that we will ever make it through college in one piece, and while running may not be your favorite form, finding something that works for you will be an invaluable respite from the chaos of our achievement-fueled lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor J. Mark Ramseyer is in the process of publishing a deeply harmful, ahistorical lie. In a much-hyped, forthcoming paper, Ramseyer claims that “comfort women” — women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II — were in fact recruited sex workers. Business women, rather than victims of serial sexual abuse.
Let’s be perfectly clear: Ramseyer’s paper has no basis in reality. Up to 200,000 comfort women were sexually enslaved by the Japanese Army before and during World War II. Survivors of this violence have, for decades, paid powerful witness to the atrocities they were subjected to. Even the Japanese government has repeatedly apologized for its crimes. Any attempt to erase or rosily rewrite the story of Japan’s comfort women is both false, and part of a growing ultra-nationalist, history-denying strain in Japanese politics that is alarmingly gaining steam.
Ramseyer’s paper brings up questions of how academia should deal with human experiences, especially traumatic ones. If Ramseyer intended to rewrite history to purposefully deny and belittle the pain of comfort women, his motives are clearly evil. But what if the aim of Ramseyer’s paper was simply to develop an academic argument? What if he genuinely felt the intellectual need to inspect comfort women through the lens of contract law? Would that change our view of the author or his monstrous creation?
No. Irrespective of the paper’s intent, its impending publication has caused real harm by giving a megaphone to the denial of the real lives and trauma comfort women and those touched by their abuse have faced, all to engage in a wanton, poorly executed intellectual exercise. The lived experiences of comfort women, several of whom are still with us today, are not fodder for abstract arguments about contract labor.
As the Editorial Board, we value academic freedom: the freedom to pursue challenging or sensitive topics and argue potentially controversial opinions. However, Ramseyer’s paper does not fall under the protection of academic freedom. Ramseyer’s paper does not express a different opinion, but is disinformation plain and simple, as many of his fellow scholars have pointed out.
Academic theories are simply not worthy of publication if they run counter to basic facts. This is hardly a new concept or cancel culture run amok, but a common-sense standard of academic decency. None among us would defend a Holocaust negationist paper. We must recognize when ideas are dangerous and factually incorrect, then shut them down accordingly.
Similarly, there is no reason to publish (or, for that matter, pen) Ramseyer’s paper. The academic journal planning to publish his work has decided, amid outcry, to additionally publish work refuting Ramseyer’s claims. Still, the nature of confirmation bias — the tendency to assume what you read is true if it agrees with you — means Ramseyer’s dangerous ideas will stick to the forefront of some readers’ minds. Clearly, publishing Ramseyer’s lies will do more harm than good.
From Government preceptor David D. Kane’s alleged racist, neo-Nazi sympathizing blog posts, to bioengineering professor Kevin K. “Kit” Parker’s class wherein undergraduates directed police activity (and nearly did again) in the majority-minority city of Springfield, Mass., a disturbing pattern of Harvard academics flouting morality has emerged.
Professors at Harvard set the academic culture that undergraduates grow in and eventually export to the sectors they do work. Their status at the front of the classroom — and, by virtue of their Harvard affiliation, the forefront of scholarship — comes with a non-trivial obligation to yield this power responsibly. When a professor is cavalier about truth in their work, their students learn that this is sort of conduct, beyond being acceptable, can get you ahead.
This bankrupt leadership breeds classroom contrarians and devil’s advocates by signaling to students that it's alright to callously and dishonestly intellectualize human suffering as long as a “hot take” emerges. It’s on Harvard and professors themselves to stop this dynamic, but as students, we should be vigilant about not absorbing dangerous lessons about what is permissible in the name of personal gain.
The Harvard name lends validity to whatever claim it becomes attached to. This is the stunning, reality-shaping power Harvard academics yield. Using this credibility to dismiss the very real harm done to sexual assault survivors is a violent abdication of responsibility that implicates both Ramseyer and Harvard. Because Harvard’s professors rely on the prestige of the Harvard name, Harvard is complicit in the damage these professors do to our intellectual culture.
Despite international press and scrutiny, the University has yet to acknowledge or refute Ramseyer’s dangerous lies about comfort women. Harvard must do better. The administration must ensure that professors like Kane, Parker, and now Ramseyer face real repercussions for their wrongdoings. Considering how quickly various Harvard affiliates — from the Korean Association of Harvard Law School to Harvard Professor of Korean History Carter J. Eckert and fellow Harvard History professor Andrew Gordon — have mobilized to rebuke Ramseyer’s paper, the University’s lack of action is striking. Individuals and organizations have flocked together to gather more than 10,000 signatures criticizing Ramseyer while Harvard has stayed silent. Harvard must come out and condemn Ramseyer’s paper for its misinformation and harm. In the meantime, the paper’s falsehoods and the notion that immorality goes unchecked here grow stronger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race in any program receiving federal financial assistance. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that “no State shall […] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Taken together, these laws offer a forceful check against differential treatment based on race. Paradoxically, however, race-conscious affirmative action policies necessarily treat members of different races differently. How, then, is modern affirmative action constitutional?
Much like there are exceptions to free speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment, it turns out that not all racial classifications are banned under the Constitution. Racial classifications fall under the umbrella of what the Supreme Court calls “suspect classifications.” For any law or program involving a suspect classification to be constitutionally valid, it must survive “strict scrutiny,” the most stringent standard of judicial review. This involves passing three tests: The program must serve a “compelling governmental interest”; it must be “narrowly tailored” to achieve only that interest; and it must be the “least restrictive means” of realizing that interest.
Regents of the University of California v. Bakke was the first time that the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education. Of the several reasons given by the UC Davis Medical School to justify its affirmative action program, one was “countering the effects of societal discrimination,” that is, remediation. This argument is rooted in group rights: Members of a minority are preferenced even if the individual benefitting has not directly been harmed, or the individual being denied preference is innocent of discrimination. In rejecting the group-rights argument in Bakke — as discussed previously — Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. thus also dismisses remedial affirmative action, describing it as “an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past.”
If remediation does not survive strict scrutiny, then what does? Justice Powell agrees with a separate justification offered by UC Davis: affirmative action is necessary for reaping the educational benefits of diversity. In his view, however, “genuine diversity” encompasses more than just racial diversity, and thus affirmative action programs are permissible as long as race is one among several factors considered during admissions. Additionally, a fixed “quota” of seats for minorities, or a separate admissions track, are not the least restrictive ways of achieving this diversity, since they insulate minorities from competition with other applicants.
In sum, Bakke establishes the crux of modern affirmative action jurisprudence: diversity is a permissible basis for race-conscious affirmative action; consideration of race is permitted only as a “plus”; and quotas are disallowed. Later Supreme Court decisions permitting race-conscious affirmative action policies, notably Grutter v. Bollinger, and Fisher v. Texas have upheld these standards imposed by Bakke.
In my opinion, Bakke manages to narrow the grounds for affirmative action significantly, for it shifts the focus of affirmative action policies from enforcing remediation to upholding a vaguely defined notion of diversity. As it stands, Harvard cannot argue in court that its race-conscious admission program attempts to correct past wrongs; rather, it simply enables the assembly of a diverse student body from which the entire community benefits. I do not contest the significance of diversity; it has been a highlight of my Harvard experience to interact with and befriend peers embodying diversity of all shades: geographic, academic, ideological, socio-economic, and yes, racial.
And yet, for all of diversity’s extraordinary benefits, affirmative action should fundamentally be about remediation, and not diversity. One might argue that group-rights-based remedial affirmative action policies penalize an innocent white applicant for harms committed in the past, or even that such policies might benefit a Black applicant no longer facing grievous discrimination, and as such are inconsistent with individual-rights jurisprudence. It is clear, however, that group harms were committed solely on the basis of race, and a group rights approach to remedy those should not be inconceivable. Indeed, a cursory examination of the world around us reiterates that the color of one’s skin continues to play an outsized role in one’s experiences. The experiences of George Floyd, Treyvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, and countless others serve as a testament to the fact that law divorced from ground realities cannot achieve justice.
Lastly, the diversity argument neglects the legacy of slavery and oppression in the United States. As author Kimberly Reyes points out, making diversity the point of affirmative action “shifts the beneficiary of the program from the historically discriminated against to the nation that had discriminated against them.” For decades, the majority was not even willing to share classrooms or train coaches with Black citizens, and racist fears about interbreeding and intermarriage were prevalent. It seems unfair, then, to expect minority students to offer transformational perspective and insight for the benefit of their non-minority peers in the name of diversity.
Diversity can be construed in myriad ways, some completely unrelated to affirmative action. A university might consider diversity of political views an admirable educational objective, but that has nothing to do with the racial legacy of the United States. The conversation about affirmative action stands to be diluted if it is reduced to platitudes about diversity being good for diversity’s sake. A math genius and a musical prodigy both add undoubtedly diverse perspectives to Harvard’s student body. But mathematical or musical talent was not the basis for slavery, or segregation, or Jim Crow. Race was, and affirmative action must first correct for racial discrimination.
None of this is to say that there do not exist well-intentioned arguments against affirmative action from perspectives cognizant of the country’s legacy of racial inequality. Having advocated for race-conscious affirmative action, in the next piece I will discuss the opposition to such policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of demonstrators gathered outside Johnston Gate Saturday afternoon in a protest organized by the Korean American Society of Massachusetts against Harvard Law professor J. Mark Ramseyer, calling for him to apologize for his recent controversial paper on “comfort women” and for the publishing journal to retract the article.
Ramseyer’s paper “Contracting for sex in the Pacific War,” which will be published in the International Review of Law and Economics, stoked international controversy last month by claiming that sex slaves under the Imperial Japanese military, known as “comfort women,” were voluntarily employed. Many of the comfort women were from Korea, and Ramseyer has faced significant backlash in South Korea since the paper was widely publicized in late January.
In front of Johnston Gate, the main entrance to Harvard Yard, members of the organization handed out South Korean flags and posters, in addition to collecting signatures for a white paper condemning Ramseyer’s article. Protest organizer Do Kim said more than 100 protesters attended the event.
In the white paper, the demonstrators demanded an apology from Ramseyer “for distorting historical facts”; for Harvard to hold Ramseyer accountable for “failing to meet research integrity”; for the IRLE to retract the article in question; and for the Japanese government to acknowledge and apologize for its “past atrocity.”
The protesters also chanted for Ramseyer’s removal from the Law School, repeating “Dismiss Ramseyer!” and “Ramseyer out!” The group also repeatedly sang “Arirang,” a folk song considered to be the anthem of Korea.
Seo Yong Ae, president of the Korean American Society of Massachusetts, gave a brief, impassioned speech in Korean during the protest, proclaiming the comfort system “clearly and apparently a war crime, sex slavery, and child abuse.”
Former Suffolk County assistant district attorney Linda Champion, who attended the protest, said the Ramseyer’s paper struck a chord among Koreans.
“It just hit a nerve with so many people that it was important for them to come out to express to Harvard University it was not okay for someone to bear a name as prestigious as Harvard and to write propaganda,” Champion said.
Ohio State University student Madison Ryan said she flew out from Columbus, Ohio, to attend Saturday’s protest. Ryan said she is a member of OSU’s chapter of WeHope, a Boston-based student organization aimed at raising awareness about the comfort women issue.
“We’re fundraising to build a statue here in Boston,” Ryan said, referring to a proposed comfort women memorial. “In order to get that statue erected, we need to prove that this is something that people here do care about.”
June Kim, a sophomore at Boston University, said she attended the protest with her parents to show support for the rights and history of comfort women.
“They need to be heard. Their story needs to be recorded, and it can’t be changed,” Kim said.
After the protest concluded, organizer Gil Lee said he was disappointed that not many Harvard students attended, adding that many students at the University have been silent on this issue.
“If Harvard students [show up], a lot of others will take more interest,” Lee said. “Especially with the Ramseyer case, a lot of questions we get is, ‘What do Harvard students think?’”
Lee added that his organization hopes to work with WeHope to build a comfort women memorial “right in front of Harvard.”
“I don’t know whether that’s going to work,” he acknowledged.
The protest drew attendees from several states and Korean American groups. Several protests have sprung up across cities in South Korea, but the protest at Harvard is the largest demonstration on the controversy in the United States to date.
On Feb. 17, the Federation of Korean American Associations of the North East held the first major protest in the U.S. in New Jersey with representatives of six states’ Korean American associations, FKAANE president Judy Yoo said in an interview Thursday.
Scholars and activists worldwide have also put together virtual petitions in place of in-person protest, in light of the current pandemic.
A late February petition by “concerned economists” organized by University of California, Los Angeles political science professor Michael Chwe has garnered more than 3,200 signatures to date, including Nobel laureates, Harvard affiliates, economists, historians, and others.
The letter calls for the journal to retract Ramseyer’s article and “take all necessary corrective measures” to address any factual concerns that have been raised. Though defending academic freedom, the authors of the letter wrote that Ramseyer’s article — which draws on game theory — must acknowledge the “truth of the embedded historical claims that form its empirical basis.”
Yuji Hosaka, professor of political science at Sejong University in Seoul, also penned a letter March 1 pointing out Ramseyer’s “critically erroneous statement.” The letter was signed by 36 individuals, including comfort woman survivor Lee Ok-seon, two members of the National Assembly of Korea, and human rights lawyers.
Hosaka addressed his statement to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow, the IRLE editor Eric A. Helland, and the Speaker of the National Assembly of Korea Park Byeong-seug. He said in an interview with The Crimson conducted in Korean that only the IRLE and the National Assembly of Korea have confirmed their receipt of his letter.
Ramseyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the protest. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment Sunday.
Andrew Davis, spokesperson for the journal’s publisher Elsevier, wrote in an email Thursday he cannot comment on the journal’s ongoing investigation into the article. The journal delayed print production of the issue, but publication of Ramseyer’s article is still considered final.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate School of Education alumni and students discussed education’s intersection with racial inequality and socioeconomic disparities at a conference Saturday.
The Alumni of Color Conference, which has occurred annually since its first iteration in 2003, was themed “Immunity in Community: Resilience in the Face of a Double Pandemic” this year.
HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long, who gave the welcoming address, highlighted what she dubbed a crisis in educational access due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Long also warned that the consequences of inaction around education gaps are great.
“The widening educational opportunity gaps between children from different backgrounds is undoubtedly one of the greatest risks of the pandemic,” she said. “Predictions suggest that by the fall of 2021, students will have lost three months, up to a year of learning, depending on the quality of their remote instruction.”
Long added that this year’s conference served as an opportunity to reflect on the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
“As we near the one year mark, when so many of us jumped to remote learning, it is a good time to consider what we’ve learned and what we want to take forward with us,” she said.
HGSE alumnus Andrew F. Williams, the conference’s host, said in his remarks that the conference should facilitate solution development for current challenges in education.
“We’re coming together to share strategies and recipes for staying strong — for getting stronger,” he said. “We come together to name our pain, but also to find and manifest and share joy in our collective struggle.”
HGSE alum César A. Cruz, delivered a keynote address in which he touched on the importance of discerning the effects of colonialism on minorities.
Cruz argued educators need to fight the long-lasting mark that colonial regimes left on the education system.
“The true focus of revolutionary change is never merely the oppressive situations that we seek to escape, but that piece of the oppressor, which is planted deep within each and every one of us,” Cruz said. “It’s so easy to smash on the system outside, but so hard to face the system within.”
As he closed his speech, Cruz called on attendees to continue forming strong educational communities for generations of students and educators.
“May you continue to center yourself, and be part of a community of care, as we create that world that we wish to be a part of,” Cruz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday endorsing a petition calling on Harvard administrators and the University’s Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute to “denounce the detention and repression” of protesters in India under Prime Minister Narendra D. Modi’s administration.
The act, sponsored by Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, passed by a vote of 22-0-4.
Tens of thousands of Indian farmers have gathered for more than three months in New Delhi to protest new agriculture laws that they say undermine their livelihoods, according to NPR. The laws are currently on hold, but the government has cracked down on the protests with internet censorship and arrests.
The petition decries actions taken against protesters by the Indian government under Modi, alleging “grievous, unconscionable, and unconstitutional” human rights violations.
“Speaking out against the Modi government’s conduct would not be taking a side on a contentious political issue—it would be the bare minimum defense of human rights necessitated by Harvard’s promise of Veritas, involvement in Indian civil society, and collaboration with the Government of India,” the petition reads.
The legislation notes that the Council has an “obligation and duty” to magnify concerns voiced by students.
“The Council has an obligation and duty to amplify students in their pursuits for justice and movement building,” the legislation reads. “The largest protest in human history is happening in India with human rights abuses happening as a result of police brutality and government violence.”
During Sunday’s meeting, the UC also passed legislation to publicize a survey to gauge student opinions on the Sophomore Blocking System — a process that allows rising sophomores to choose whom to reside with in their upperclassmen houses.
“The blocking process has the possibility to be exclusionary, strain interpersonal relationships, and reinforce social divisions,” the legislation reads.
The UC said it will develop the survey results into “A Report on Student Opinion about the Sophomore Blocking System,” which will include solutions to reform the system to be more inclusive.
Sponsored by Crimson Yard Representative Lisa R. Mathew ’24 and Lowell House Representative David Y. Zhang ’23, the legislation passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in a Friday interview that Harvard is currently planning for fall 2021 with the “overriding goal” of “charting a path to a full return for our students, our faculty, and staff.”
Gay said she is eager for Harvard to regain its “campus-based identity,” and she hopes fall 2021 will include “as much in-person learning as possible” for undergraduates.
Gay acknowledged, however, that despite the “positive a set of trends” in regard to reduced Covid-19 spread on campus this spring, she foresees that “there might be some form of the pandemic still with us” in the fall.
“I’ve been really pleased by on-campus conditions this spring, and we have yet another day of no new infections,” Gay said. “But what I will say is that any planning that we pursue has to build in flexibility because, again, one of the challenges of the pandemic is its unpredictable course and our need to pivot more than once in order to continue to put health and safety first while also preserving and advancing our academic enterprise.”
Gay said the in-person teaching pilots this spring — led by Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanada J. Claybaugh — will help prepare the FAS for the possibility of hybrid learning in the fall, which would include in-person and online components for larger courses.
FAS will continue to seek advice from the Division of Continuing Education, whose Extension School has delivered courses via Zoom for the last five years, she added.
“It helped that the FAS is home to the Division of Continuing Education, and because of that, we had some already in-house expertise in learning effectively online and were able to draw on that to help with our pivot last March,” Gay said. “We’re again drawing on those in-house expertise and experience as we undertake the pilots this spring in hybrid learning.”
In spring 2021, undergraduate enrollment dipped nearly 20 percent from the previous year as some students chose to defer their studies. Their potential return — or delayed arrival, in the case of freshmen — in the fall leaves open the possibility that an usually high number of students will opt to live on campus, Gay acknowledged.
“Certainly, as we contemplate the fall, we are thinking hard about what enrollment might be like, and what it means to continue to pursue residential liberal arts education in a context where we may have a larger number of students enrolled,” Gay said.
Harvard previously stated that it cannot guarantee housing during the 2021-2022 academic year to students who took time off this past year.
As Harvard approaches the one-year anniversary of its shift to remote operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Gay said she was “enormously proud” of the “incredible resilience” of Harvard affiliates, citing staff, faculty, and students’ flexibility to adapt to remote learning and teaching.
“Even through [the pandemic], we’ve actually managed to also have some positive experiences,” Gay said. “Our faculty have brought creative and innovative approaches to remote teaching.”
“Our students have embraced the opportunities of remote learning and have worked incredibly hard to make the most of what has been a challenging, challenging year, and certainly not what they imagined college to be,” she added.
Gay said her “greatest disappointment” in planning for the current school year was not providing sophomores at the College the opportunity to return to Harvard’s campus.
“If there is a single great kind of regret, it would be that sophomores have had to stay off campus for this long,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor of Japanese Legal Studies J. Mark Ramseyer has faced an outpouring of public criticism from government officials worldwide against his upcoming paper, which claims that sex slaves, known as “comfort women,” under the Imperial Japanese military were voluntary employed.
Ramseyer’s paper stoked international controversy by disputing the historical consensus that “comfort women” — a euphemism commonly used to refer to women and girls used as sex slaves by the Imperial Japanese military before and during World War II — were compelled into sex work against their will.
Unlike many scholastic disputes, which do not stretch far outside academia, Ramseyer’s article has drawn strong responses from high-ranking government officials of several countries, including the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, and even North Korea.
While most officials in the U.S. and the East Asian countries besides Japan — all of which were at least partially occupied by the Japanese military in the 20th century — have criticized Ramseyer’s paper, some political figures in Japan have expressed their support.
Ramseyer pushed back against criticism of his paper in an early February interview with The Crimson and subsequent statements, though he more recently admitted in a Feb. 26 New Yorker article that he had made “a mistake” in the paper by referring to the employer of one comfort woman as her “owner.”
In an email to Law School colleagues Feb. 25, which he provided to The Crimson, Ramseyer wrote he is working on a “memo and set of materials” responding to criticisms regarding his paper in an effort to be “transparent about what did and didn’t go into the article and why.”
Still, he noted the issue has taken on “a life of its own,” and he is cautious not to instigate more controversy.
“This is an important and sensitive issue, I do not want to escalate the dispute further,” Ramseyer continued. “I want to be transparent about what did and didn’t go into the article and why. But this is not the main focus of my work, and I leave it to others to continue this debate.”
Over the last month, several U.S. representatives — all from California — have criticized Ramseyer’s research.
“I cannot stand by while he rewrites history and misleads future generations about the truth,” Rep. Michelle E. Steel (R-Calif.) wrote in a statement sent to The Crimson Sunday. “His article only contributes to the harmful denial of the very painful and true events these women endured.”
In a mid-February tweet, Rep. Young O. Kim (R-Calif.) urged Ramseyer to apologize for his article, writing that it was “offensive to victims.”
“We must support victims of human trafficking & slavery, not tear them down,” Kim wrote on Twitter. “I urge [Ramseyer] to apologize.”
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has previously spoken out about the comfort women issue. Asked about Ramseyer’s paper, an aide provided a 2014 statement in which Schiff referred to the issue as a “crime against humanity” and said he stands with surviving comfort women “in recognizing the horrors” they endured.
The controversy even made its way to the White House. In a Mar. 3 press briefing, a journalist asked White House Press Secretary Jennifer R. “Jen” Psaki about Ramseyer and the comfort women issue.
Psaki responded that she was “happy to take a closer look” at the issue, but had not seen the article or its condemnations. She added that she will talk to the “national security team” and follow up.
Beyond the federal level, the dispute over Ramseyer’s paper worked itself into the legal record.
Last Thursday, the Philadelphia City Council unanimously passed a non-binding resolution condemning Ramseyer’s article and validating the legitimacy of the historical coercion of comfort women.
Councilmember David H. Oh, who introduced the resolution, told The Crimson he felt taking action at the local government level was necessary, adding that the issue was “very painful” for many Philadelphians.
“I didn’t want to just write a letter and have my colleagues sign it — I wanted to take an official action,” Oh said. “It is important for us as governmental entities to respond to this type of thing.”
Across the Pacific, Ramseyer’s article drew strong rebukes from officials and representatives of several foreign governments.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying responded to a question regarding Ramseyer at a Feb. 19 press conference by saying the history of comfort women is a “fact with iron-clad evidence.”
“China opposes all erroneous acts that whitewash the war of aggression in an attempt to deny and distort history,” she said, according to a translation on the Foreign Ministry website.
South Korean Minister of Gender Equality and Family Chung Young-ai hosted an emergency conference with Korean professors, researchers, and lawyers Tuesday to discuss Ramseyer’s article as well as future plans for comfort women memorial projects.
According to a Feb. 16 press release, the agency finds Ramseyer’s article “truly lamentable” and hopes that “tarnishing the victims’ dignity and honor will no longer be repeated.”
Members of the Seoul Metropolitan Council came together to re-establish a special committee for investigating pro-Japanese and anti-nationalist actions — this committee was initially created by the Korean National Assembly in 1948, but was dissolved within a year of its establishment.
On Friday, the special committee of the Seoul Metropolitan Council that investigates pro-Japanese and anti-nationalist actions hosted an emergency conference and decided to initiate a boycott campaign against Mitsubishi, the major Japanese corporation that endowed Ramseyer’s professorship.
Ramseyer — whose title is Mitsubishi Professor of Japanese Legal Studies — told The Crimson in early February that the professorship was established decades ago and there are no “strings” or money from Mitsubishi attached to it today.
Mitsubishi Group is composed of roughly 40 separate, autonomous companies; it is unclear which branch was involved in the creation of Ramseyer’s professorship. Spokesperson Jeremy J. Barnes of Mitsubishi Motors North America wrote in an emailed statement Friday that “the program at Harvard Law School is not in any way related to our company (Mitsubishi Motors North America) or our parent company (Mitsubishi Motors Corporation).”
Even North Korean state-run media outlets joined South Korean officials in condemning Ramseyer.
DPRK Today, a China-based news site sponsored by the North Korean government, called Ramseyer a “pseudo-scholar” and a “dirty money grubber” in an article in Korean last Tuesday, according to VICE. DPRK Today did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite rarely reporting on events outside the Korean peninsula, North Korean state broadcaster Korean Central Television aired a comfort women documentary with similar denouncements on Mar. 1, according to United Press International.
Japanese officials have remained largely silent on the issue, though Hiroshi Yamada — former member of the National Diet who is a member of an organization aligned with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — supported Ramseyer publicly on Twitter in late February.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is well aware of the professor’s current situation,” Yamada wrote on Twitter in Japanese. “We discussed that we will do whatever we can.”
In a follow-up tweet, Yamada clarified that he does speak for the Ministry and will not exercise influence over its decision-making. Yamada’s office and the Japanese Embassy in the U.S. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Shigeharu Aoyama, member of the upper house of Japan’s National Diet who has previously denied the legitimacy of comfort women, wrote on his blog that he encourages sending positive messages to Ramseyer.
Tessa Morris-Suzuki — professor emerita of Japanese history at Australian National University — and David A. McNeill, professor at Sacred Heart University in Tokyo, published an article Thursday in Japan Forward, the English arm of nationalist Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun. In the article, Morris-Suzuki and McNeill wrote that Ramseyer’s article violates “basic academic standards,” and that calls for its retraction of Ramseyer’s article are “not suppression of free speech.”
Morris-Suzuki wrote in an emailed statement that she hopes the article will be read by “regular readers of Japan Forward,” for whom the article may contain information “of which many of them are probably unaware.” Sankei Shimbun’s publication of Ramseyer’s abstract in January originally sparked much of the media attention toward Ramseyer’s article.
She added that she and McNeill had reached out to a number of media outlets in Japan, including more mainstream Japanese newspapers, but that “rather disturbingly,” Japan Forward was the only outlet interested in publishing their article.

Home to the infamous Ten-Man suite and some wild stein nights, Currier has a little party for everyone. While most of us know this special member of the Quad has an amazing number of singles, what’s the real tea on being sorted into the friendliest House at Harvard, and what’s the deal with all those trees?
“Oh man, so where to begin??” HoCo co-chair Itay Dvir ’22 laughed when asked what he thinks is unique about Currier. Described as the “most inclusive House” by Dvir, Currier prides itself on its incredible support network through tutors and a strong LGBTQ+ community. HoCo co-chair Caroline M. Kubacki ’22 added that “we truly listen to our Currierites’ needs” and try to respond to them, as Currier culture is super focused on making sure all students feel supported and included in academic and social life.
Dvir and Kubacki made it clear that when it comes to intramurals, Currier’s (really) not messing around. Currier holds the current title in intramural volleyball, and also has a strong soccer team, with dozens of Currierites showing up to watch each game, according to Dvir. “We bust out people, we just bust out... It’s a really, really strong culture,” he said. Currier also proudly displays the “Green Cup” in its dining hall, a trophy Kubacki described as “like the Stanley Cup, but [for being] environmentally friendly.”
The co-chairs emphasized that Currier can really be curated to fit the needs of any Currierite, — whether you need to socialize and relax a little bit, get help with a pset, work out, grab food, or catch up on reading, there will always be a space and a group of people that are willing to do that with you. Kubacki said one of the best parts of Currier is that “it’s really hard to feel invisible,” and, as one of the most social and inclusive Houses, it’s “always a party.”
While it might sound surprising, when we sat down with the Currier HoCo co-chairs and asked for some favorite Currier memories, a few of their most memorable times in the House included this year’s virtual events. Currier House has been popping off with some exciting Zoom activities, such as a matcha making class that made it into Kubacki’s top mems. If matcha making isn’t your style, the past few weeks in Currier have also seen a chocolate tasting class and a tea meditation. And that’s just in the past few weeks! Kubacki also noted that “the fun and camaraderie of Currier” comes through in these events, even if the community can’t experience them together in person. Clearly, Currier seems to be killing it in this virtual world!
Both of the co-chairs said one of the best parts of Currier is the physical set-up of the building. The House boasts an absurd amount of kitchens, topping off with around 52 cooking spaces, and also offers some more unique spaces like massage rooms, music rooms, and most recently, a meditation room, which was added after a group of Currierites asked if an area could be designated for prayer.
With only one main door, there is no sneaking in or out of Currier. Kubacki and Dvir described it as a “sucker culture,” because by the time you’ve gotten to your room, you’ve already passed dozens of Currierites eating in the dhall, chatting in the Fishbowl, enjoying some of Currier’s various game tables, or maybe even singing some ~Currioke~. Truly no way to escape this House spirit!
If all this exciting info hasn’t satisfied your Currier curiosity, Kubacki and Dvir answered even more questions for us. 
If your House were a Harry Potter house, which one would it be?
CMK: I’m thinking Hufflepuff — and we have a huge Quidditch community!
ID: So both me and Caroline are both Hufflepuff, like probably hardcore Hufflepuffs, and a lot of HoCo is also Hufflepuff. Some of the most social people in Currier are Huff. I think that we are a social House — we’re caring, we have a lot of empathy. I’m thinking Cedric Diggory, I’m thinking honor. We have House pride, to the max… so I think we’d have to take Hufflepuff.
If you had to describe your House in three words, what would they be?
CMK: Inclusive is definitely one of them. I want to say creative. We have a huge dance studio, so I feel like there’s a lot of dance teams always coming through here, there’s a lot of artists...
ID: If I'm going to go in depth a little bit more — there’s a Hebrew word that doesn’t translate directly into English, but it’s called “firgun,” and it’s just this ability to be truly happy and supportive when other people in your community succeed… I think there’s constant support for you everywhere you look.
What is one thing you want incoming Currierites to know about their House?
CMK: You just won the jackpot! You might be a little far away, but honestly the distance is nothing. I actually think the entire Quad community as a whole is absolutely incredible on top of the Currier community. So, I think you’re going to be supported and it’s going to be a very social, fun, enthusiastic, energy-giving environment.
ID: I remember getting sorted into Currier… I came in with a very open mind, very excited, and I’ve gotten everything that I’ve wanted and more out of the House, and I think that’s a shared opinion from a lot of people. So, I just think everything that Caroline said. Have an open mind, be excited, and we’re super excited to welcome all of them in!

Some might refer to Pforzheimer House as the best House in the Quad, but its residents refer to it as the best House at Harvard! Filled with guinea pigs, a bee habitat, and the Igloo, being sorted into Pfoho is truly an unpforgettable experience.
Pfoho thrives off of its tight-knit and active community — most of its events are Pfoho-specific and catered to those living in the House. And trust us, this House knows how to throw an event! Some of their most iconic examples include the themed Open Houses with weeks of prior planning, tons of fun, and good food — one even had a huge chocolate fountain — and cool themes like Harry Potter! They also have smaller events like S’mores Night (being that they’re the only House in the Quad with a fireplace on their terrace) and fancy ones like the Pfoho High Tea, which the Resident Deans serve and cater.
House pride is very prevalent in Pfoho as well. While most Houses have one mascot costume, Pfoho has eight. HoCo co-chair Javin Pombra ’22 even claims that people fight over who gets to wear the costumes on Housing Day. He adds, “It’s not fun wearing a polar bear costume. You’re like sweaty, kinda gross; you can’t really breathe or see. But people still wanna do it because they just love Pfoho that much, which I think is a very symbolic expression of our spirit.” Moreover, steins are really well attended at the House, and Pombra notes that if you happened to come to Pfoho on a random Thursday night, there’d be a line out of the door for the event!
On a normal day, Pfoho’s Dhall is where a lot of the socializing magic happens. It’s common for people to go there not even to eat, but just to get work done and talk to other House members — what Pombra calls the “small moments of House spirit.” Basically, the House members love interacting with one another, and show up to anything the House has to offer!
While the lively House culture Pfoho had pre-Covid looks a bit different now, HoCo chairs and members have done their best to keep it alive — and from the looks of these events, they’re doing a great job at it, too! Pfoho HoCo has transitioned some of their favorite House events into the virtual world, and (despite Zoom fatigue) the Pfohomies have come through in full force. Recently, they hosted a Trivia Night, and over 40 people came ready to throw down some ~knowledge~! Also, to welcome this year’s sophomores, they’ve started new traditions like a House mentorship program and sent their newest residents care packages filled with Pfoho swag.
Pfoho is made up of five main buildings, including the Jordans, an apartment complex nearby. There are tons of singles, and it’s very common for sophomores to get one if they desire — the House 100 percent prioritizes student wants, according to Pombra. So whether you desire a big suite or a single, Pfoho has it all! Pombra said he believes Pfoho has “the best sophomore housing in all of Harvard.”
All classes are integrated together to further develop a House community. A room that sophomores can especially look forward to is the Duplex on the top floor of Pfoho — composed of two stories with a large common room, lots of singles, and two bathrooms (wow!). The Belltower is another place that upperclassmen usually reside in… but they typically throw tons of parties, so you might get to see it before it’s your time to live there too!
And Pfoho has more to offer than just its amazing living spaces — the House has tons of common spaces and amenities too! One is the Arcade room, with loads of games to choose from (like our personal favorite, air hockey); another is the Pfojo (the Pfoho twist of a dojo) that offers yoga, a gym, and martial arts! After your workout, you might want to hit the Spfa, filled with massage chairs. And, of course, they have music rooms and a library as well. The JCR holds the Dhall and the Quad Grille, where steins are usually held and are always filled with laughter and fun times.
If that wasn’t enough to sell you, Pombra answered some pfun questions so you could get a pfeel of the House.
What’s the biggest misconception about your House?
JP: That living in the Quad somehow makes you have FOMO or makes you far away from things… Like number one, you won’t have FOMO because there is literally so much happening in the Quad. Number two, even in the winter, even when it’s warm, the best way to clear your mind is a walk. There will be no FOMO, and you will enjoy the walk. The Quad is not that far, that’s the biggest misconception — and people will come visit you.
If you could describe your House in 3 words, what would it be?
JP: Pfabulous. Pfriendly. Pfestive.
What is something people in your House all have in common?
JP: Being genuine. When they say “let’s get a meal,” you’ll get a meal with someone in Pfoho. It won’t be just a passing comment. Everyone who is in Pfoho ends up wanting to talk to you and wanting to get to know you… I’ll just say authenticity and genuineness. Also a love for polar bears.
What’s the ~vibe~ of your House?
JP: It’s cozy — think of like, sitting next to a window with a couple of friends, seeing the snow outside and having a cup of hot chocolate, next to a fireplace. I think that’s the perfect vibe.

Cabot House does Quad life best: singles bigger than other Houses’ doubles, an underground tunnel system, and best of all, escape from the Harvard tourists. Cabot students truly live the best of both worlds.
“Our motto is Semper Cor, which is Latin for always heart,” House Committee Co-Chair Evans A. Berreondo Giron ’22 says, highlighting Cabot’s emphasis on cultural inclusivity and creating spaces for everyone. The Cabot community really does the most to make everyone feel at home, especially for freshmen who may not be the most enthusiastic about the Quad. “It’s far from the other River Houses… but the caveat to that is that the Quad community as a whole, among the three Houses, is so strong,” adds fellow Co-Chair Isabel Dierson ’22. With no tourists around and lots of puppies on the lawn, the Cabot community really has its own space to thrive.
Cabot is home to various fun events throughout the year which are meant to foster community. Festivus, the annual winter holiday party, is a chance for everyone to come together to show off their unique talents and burn their grievances away to start the new year fresh. Who doesn’t love a good fire to burn the negative energy away? Berreondo Giron highlighted two other major traditions: Cabot Culinaries, in which students come together monthly to cook and share meals in a family-style dinner, and Cabot Formal Hall, during which students dress up for fancy dinners according to a theme. In another Cabot tradition, Dutch Auction, Cabot residents can auction off objects or services, like doing someone’s laundry for a month.
If you somehow can’t find a Cabot event that you enjoy (though we doubt it), then you have the freedom to host your own! Even with set in place Cabot traditions, there’s always room to introduce new events. The Rakesh Grant (name possibly in flux after the Khuranas stepped down as faculty deans) allows any Cabot student to put in an application for their own event and receive funding for it, from chocolate tastings to a Bachelor viewing party. And recently, the Faculty Deans started a tradition of placing ice lanterns around the lawn, making trips to the Dhall even more magical. “[Student freedom] is the theme of Cabot,” Dierson explains. “It’s our House, it’s the Resident Deans’ Houses, it’s all of our Houses.”
Despite the current virtual barriers, Cabot has tried its best to maintain a close-knit community. This year, the House has thrown plenty of virtual steins, giving students $20 to buy the food and drinks of their choice. Cabot HoCo has also been actively sending merch and hosting virtual meetings to allow new and old members to meet. Wellness committees on HoCo lead meditation sessions, and a Cabot Strava account has been keeping the community connected through group exercise challenges. But Cabot is mainly focused on catering to the needs and interests of its students: whatever you want to do, Cabot wants to make it happen — especially in this virtual environment.
If your freshman dorm has left you feeling a little claustrophobic, Cabot House is here to save the day. Berreondo Giron and Dierson excitedly shared that space has never been their worry — Dierson said that she can even do a cartwheel in her room! Cabot housing can be summed up in five words: big singles, really nice suites. Yes, even as a sophomore, you too can get a single. With room for 380 students, the small size makes for a tight-knit community that knows how to live it up.
Cabot House is also home to a dance studio, a music room, and of course, the Aquarium, so all your (post-Covid) party needs will be fully satisfied. And when you need a late-night bite, Cabot Cafe is open until 1 a.m. on most nights, so you can enjoy all the coffee and pastries you need. And while Cabot surrounds the Quad Lawn on all sides, most of its buildings are connected by an underground tunnel system — even on the coldest winter days, you can walk to the Dhall and back in your pajamas without ever having to face the snow. What more do you need?
Still need more info on Cabot? We’ve got you covered. Berreondo Giron and Dierson were eager to share their love for their House:
What is the biggest misconception about Cabot House?
EBG: That it’s far from the Yard, it literally is not far. That’s the best part of my morning, just walking and listening to my music, that’s the only way I can actually wake up.
ID: It’s this like, perceived distance… I love taking the bus, and I truly believe that the shuttle is super accessible. It just drops you right off at Johnston Gate. If you’re not a walker like Evans, you just take the shuttle and it drops you off right there.
If you could describe your House as a HUDS dish, what would it be?
EBG: Red’s Best Catch, because we are the best.
ID: Oh, okay I like that. Yeah do that, Red’s Best Catch.
If you had to change one thing about your House, what would it be?
EBG: Nothing, Semper Cor, we’re perfect. That’s all we need.
ID: Honestly, nothing too… If I had to pick something more concrete, it’d be that initial feeling on Housing Day that a lot of freshmen sometimes have… I wish that just didn’t happen, because I think that if everyone just went into their Houses open-minded, you can discover if you do or do not actually like that community... But nothing about the House.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
ID: I don’t know how to pick… I feel like my gut instinct goes to, I want them to know that Cabot, in my experience, is one of the most friendly and most diverse and lovely communities on campus… You’d be hard pressed not to find your people/a home in the Cabot community.
EBG: I think I would want them to know that we really want Cabot to be like a second home to everyone, a home away from home. Whatever they want to do with the House, it’s their House... If they want to make new traditions, we’re totally down for that too… Every freshman who gets Cabot should deem themselves lucky.
