After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wondering what’s been under way on the grassy plot of land in front of Lowell House during the past couple of weeks? Last weekend we got our answer when the Harvard Community Garden was unveiled as part of the University’s Earth Day festivities. Meant as a hands-on classroom as well as a fully functioning garden, this project is yet another encouraging demonstration of our campus’ commitment to sustainability.
Arguably the most tangible of Harvard’s environmental initiatives, the garden’s mere presence will serve to raise awareness about how the food we eat relates to the planet we inhabit. But, more than that, the garden will also provide students with the opportunity to engage with sustainable farming and gardening firsthand. Two interns have already been selected to tend to and promote the garden this summer—an excellent learning experience that goes beyond Harvard’s previous offerings. We appreciate that the garden now provides Harvard with a resource for students interested in pursuing sustainable agriculture as a career—an unfortunately neglected field at one of the country’s most ambitious universities.
The collaborative nature of the Harvard Community Garden proves just as encouraging. A long-awaited initiative, the project finally became a reality this month thanks to the joint efforts of the Environmental Action Committee, the Office for Sustainability, the Food Literacy Project, and others. It is heartening to see both students and administrators working toward the same goal—and such a positive one at that. We hope that the Harvard Community Garden is only the first example of the fruit such partnerships can bear.
Indeed, there is reason to believe that the garden will be the start of better things to come. Although criticized by some Not In My Backyard naysayers, the garden’s central location is actually perfect for achieving its mission. Among other benefits, its visibility will lend legitimacy to the garden in the same way that other student groups’ social spaces do. The garden may seem out of place now, but in time—like the final clubs, Harvard Lampoon, and Harvard Hillel that surround the plot of land—it will help to establish environmental groups as fixtures of the Harvard landscape. This will sow the seeds for a future in which sustainability is front and center in students’ daily lives.
In the meantime, we encourage undergraduates who might be curious about the garden to participate. Living up to its name, the Harvard Community Garden will organize “community workdays” for anyone to come get his or her hands dirty. This opportunity for involvement is central to the garden’s success, since it can reach its laudable goal only if it succeeds in growing Harvard’s population of environmentally conscious individuals along with the arugula and chard.
The Harvard Community Garden offers much reason for optimism. The sustainability movement has already taken root at Harvard; with the garden—and further initiatives that the project will inspire—we hope it will continue to blossom.

If The Harvard Crimson’s FlyByBlog replicated its namesake, it would probably run the same posts for several days in a row. The articles wouldn’t be fresh or interesting, and you’d probably finish reading them completely unsatisfied. That’s bad in a blog, and it’s even worse in a lunch service.
I would give the Harvard University Dining Services’ Fly-By option an “F” for its food, for its freshness, and for the word I think of whenever I must once again bypass the congealed baked ziti offering. Indeed, HUDS’ self-proclaimed “basics-only bagged lunch grab-n-go” in the basement of Annenberg Hall is horrendous and should be reformed immediately.
The food is terrible. The sandwiches are cold and generally lack flavor, having been stored in a refrigerator for far too long. The side options, including mediocre yogurt and fruit far beyond ideal ripeness, are underwhelming at best. The hot option is usually an unappealing variation of sauce-covered pasta. Fly-By simply makes for an unpleasant dining experience.
Additionally, Fly-By lacks sufficient variety. Why, dare I ask, in the two times that I went there in one week, was one of the soup options peanut soup? HUDS’ peanut soup proved it didn’t deserve to exist on just one sampling, and although I didn’t try it again, I could probably guess that it wasn’t much better on the second go-around. Please don’t dump unwanted faux-curry sauce on us and expect us to eat it. Furthermore, there should be more than just one hot entrée option. Cheesy pasta with tomato sauce doesn’t cut it as the only main dish, especially when it’s served with Fly-By’s frequency.
Fly-By’s lack of variety compounds a larger issue; the food that is served is unhealthy. The idea of eating a meal you don’t like and that won’t benefit your body is doubly offensive. For those of us who use Fly-By, there should be a wider range of healthier options (sorry, bruised clementines and dry salad-in-a-cup don’t count).
Admittedly, adding more options to Fly-By’s roster as suggested might slow down the dining process. However, the assumption that all Fly-By patrons want a quick lunch is largely false anyway. Often, students go to Fly-By simply because the location or times are convenient. Fly-By is the only free lunch option available to upperclassmen near the Science Center. It is also the only viable option near the Yard for students who must eat before a 12 p.m. class. No River House dining halls are open at 11:30 a.m. Therefore, HUDS should certainly keep fast options available, but speed-eating requirements shouldn’t preclude better options for the rest of us.
Because many students are, in fact, able to have a leisurely lunch, Fly-By should be more environmentally friendly. Many students sit down to eat and do not, in fact, grab-n-go. In addition to the plastic bags, cups, and utensils Fly-By offers for portable lunches, HUDS should provide trays, glasses, and silverware for students who have more time to eat. If HUDS is truly committed to sustainability, then Fly-By should be greener.
Ultimately, students should come to Fly-By hungry and leave happy. Just a few changes could make that happen. Whenever it happens, we’ll be sure to let you know. Just be sure check out FlyByBlog.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his 1965 inaugural address, President Lyndon B. Johnson accentuated the idea of America as a spiritual quest for freedom from both tyranny and misery. In his clarion call for reform, LBJ argued that America’s soul is the promise that those who make the journey to our land can labor to share in its fruits and be liberated from poverty, discrimination, and ignorance. We are dignified by what we have accomplished and distraught by our sometimes terrible failures, but most importantly, we are proud of what we strive to achieve. Our faith in the future is the foundation of our strength.
Recently, the question of who is permitted to share in America’s journey and bounty was answered in an un-American fashion. This past Friday, the Arizona state legislature took immigration reform into its own crude hands by passing Senate Bill 1070, legislation intended to further criminalize undocumented workers in the state. Among other things, the bill requires that police officers determine the immigration status of anyone they apprehend and deem “reasonably suspicious.” It outlaws the employment of day laborers and prohibits anyone—citizen or otherwise—from wittingly transporting undocumented immigrants. Perhaps worst of all, the legislation permits Arizonans to sue police officers who they imagine to be insufficiently vigilant. SB1070 is not rooted in a desire for order so much as a sentiment of fear.  As acknowledged in a Crimson staff editorial on Monday, the bill does little to curb undocumented immigration, but almost certainly incites racial profiling, fosters the presumption that some folks are guilty until proven innocent, cripples law enforcement, and exposes government agencies to frivolous lawsuits.
The passage of SB1070 reveals an important but oft-ignored truth: If progressives don’t unite and push for comprehensive immigration reform at a national level, local reactionaries will enact policies that contradict the American Dream of a more classless and a casteless society. SB1070 is likely to be struck down by the courts, as was California’s Proposition 187 in 1998, but if progressives don’t craft new policy, there will be many more SB1070s to come.
In the last half century, immigration reform has caused schizophrenia among left-of-center Americans. One response to reform, which comes naturally to academics and wealthier liberals, tends to focus on cultural prejudice and international economic inequality. It imagines that the inequalities between nations can be mitigated through a lenient, cosmopolitan immigration policy. The second response, which comes more naturally to union members and the unsoundly employed, tends to focus on domestic economic security. It contends that the cosmopolitan approach runs counter to America’s responsibility to its own citizens suppressing wages, threatening social services, and exacerbating unemployment.
We saw evidence of the clash of these two philosophies during the debate over the 2006 reform bill, in which the Republican proposal for a guest worker program was particularly contentious. This need not be the case this time around; the two approaches can and must be reconciled. Americans deserve reform that strengthens national security, protects working families, promotes immigrant rights, and aids economic recovery.
Immigration reform, even during a recession, doesn’t have to put American’s citizen workforce and undocumented immigrants at odds. There’s more than enough room for common ground. Reform policies should be guided by the principle of offering safe employment to the undocumented  who already work here and unionizing those jobs to raise wages. When workers of any origin can’t live with their families, organize, and work for their children’s healthcare and education, everyone in this country suffers. A more controlled and humane immigration system can help undocumented immigrants integrate into the rest of the American workforce. As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argued earlier this month, a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants can help shore up our social safety net. It can also fill our coffers for further reform: the Congressional Budget Office estimates that had the Senate reform bill passed in 2006, it would have generated $66 billion in federal revenues from 2007-2016, and only cost $54 billion in direct spending over the same period.
For LBJ, the highest symbols of our faith were the obstacles that lie before us: “the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge” to be overcome by the strength of our spirit and the sweat of our hands. In the past, left-of-center Americans weren’t averse to compromising with each other in order to cross the political wastelands and meet towering challenges. Those who would merely criticize the status quo must realize that the moment demands agency. We have new badlands to traverse. America was begun by strangers who found common purpose in a voyage. Many folks have joined the journey, discovering a pride more powerful than chauvinism, a faith stronger than fear. For Americans, and especially for progressives, it is time to re-earn our heritage and renew this country’s promise. It’s time to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

To the editors:
I read William Bergstrom’s April 26th article, “Agency Under Fire,” in which he claims my amendment to the intelligence authorization bill would greatly restrict outside employment by employees of the Central Intelligence Agency. The author mischaracterizes the nature of my amendment.
First, far from banning large categories of outside employment, my amendment would establish a uniform approval process for such employment.
Second, my amendment does not mention the CIA.
There are 16 agencies in the intelligence community with each having different standards for outside employment.  All federal agencies are required to have conflict of interest guidelines that set limits on employees’ outside employment. These guidelines are developed jointly by the agency and the Office of Government Ethics. However, the Director of National Intelligence has not issued intelligence community-wide policy guidance on conflicts of interest for outside employment.  The lack of consistent guidelines leads to confusion among agency employees about what is permissible.
The amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Government Ethics to come up with uniform standards for outside employment that would provide a baseline for all intelligence community agencies.
No one is arguing that federal employees cannot hold second jobs. The guidelines are designed to ensure that those jobs do not pose a conflict of interest to their government work. Intelligence community employees have many valuable skills that can be used in outside employment. My amendment ensures that they do not do so at the expense of the taxpayer.

Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow denounced a law student’s e-mail circulated on school lists this week that suggested black people are genetically inferior to white people.
According to media reports, third-year law student Stephanie N. Grace’s private e-mail detailing her views on race was forwarded to the Black Law Students Association e-mail list earlier this week, and then circulated nationally soon after.
In her e-mail, Grace allegedly wrote that she “absolutely” does not “rule out the possibility that African Americans are, on average, genetically predisposed to be less intelligent.”
“Everyone wants someone to take 100 white infants and 100 African American ones and raise them in Disney utopia and prove once and for all that we are all equal on every dimension,” Grace allegedly wrote.
“I am merely not 100% convinced that this is the case,” the e-mail continued.
According to Professor Charles J. Ogletree, a BLSA adviser, the student—whom  he declined to name—approached Dean of Students Ellen Cosgrove Wednesday upon learning that the e-mail was forwarded.
The student sent the e-mail to several friends in November, Ogletree said. Ogletree added that he was unsure why the e-mail had not been circulated until now.
Olgetree said he asked the student to come to his office, where the two “had a heart to heart and she profusely apologized,” he added.
Minow met with BLSA leaders Wednesday when the e-mail first surfaced. In a message she sent to the Law School yesterday morning, Minow wrote that the “circulation of one student’s comment does not reflect the views of the school or the overwhelming majority of the members of this community.”
Professor Ronald S. Sullivan, who is also Winthrop House Master, said that the “unfortunate statement grew out of a very ugly part of our history where blackness itself was assigned physical meaning.”
Some students at the Law School mentioned that the media exposure and backlash has been unfair because Grace’s e-mail was intended to be private. But others said they felt the administration should not overlook the incident.
The student assumed the risk of her e-mail being widely circulated as soon as she sent it to multiple people, Sullivan said.
“The way this came out is unfortunate because it doesn’t facilitate open conversation,” said Jennifer Dein, president of the Law School’s student government.
According to legal blog Above the Law, Grace wrote an e-mail apology to BLSA that stated, “I am deeply sorry for the pain caused by my e-mail...I would give anything to take it back.”
Ogletree said that he “consider[s] the matter closed” following the student’s apology and Dean Minow’s response. “The Law School has done everything it could have done, and should have done,” he said.
Above the Law previously reported that BLSA is actively attempting to get Grace’s upcoming federal clerkship for conservative Judge Alex Kozinski rescinded. However, Minow and Sullivan said these reports were false.
“The Harvard community is strong. She is a part of it,” Sullivan said. “And I think our community will be even stronger after having worked through the pain that the e-mail has caused.”
Neither Grace nor BLSA officers returned repeated requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Federal inspectors are investigating whether the death of Professor Stephen W. Lagakos last October in a car crash was caused by sudden-acceleration problems attributed to defective Toyota cars.
Lagakos—an international leader in AIDS research and long-time biostatistics professor at the School of Public Health—was killed on impact while driving his 2002 Toyota Highlander sport utility vehicle in Peterborough, N.H., on Oct. 12, 2009.
Witnesses told USA Today that Lagakos had been “driving like a man on fire” shortly before the accident. According to observers, after speeding on Route 202 in order to pass a car, Lagakos’ car swerved into oncoming traffic, hitting a Chevy Malibu driven by Stephen Krause. The collision killed both drivers, as well as two family members traveling with Lagakos, according to a Boston Globe article published Tuesday.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Feb. 10 put out a consumer advisory to Toyota customers, which warns of recurring “safety defects” that involve several Toyota vehicle models that are being recalled. Though the 2008-2010 Highlander models are listed in the advisory, the 2002 Highlander that Lagakos was driving at the time of the accident is not on the advisory list and has yet to be recalled.
In a statement published on its website, Toyota Motor Corporation wrote that they sympathize with the “individuals and families involved in any accident involving our vehicles,” adding that the corporation is “making an all-out effort to ensure our vehicles are safe and are making substantial progress towards completing our recalls with effective and durable solutions.”
Investigators have been unable to rule out sudden acceleration as the cause of Lagakos’ crash, Peterborough police Sergeant Michael Chapdelaine told the Globe on Tuesday.
“That’s still looming in the back of my mind—that that could have been a possibility, especially at this stage of the game,” he added.
Victor De Gruttola, chair of the School of Public Health’s biostatistics department, noted that “Toyota has been restrictive” with revealing certain information about the Highlander.
De Gruttola also added that he hopes that Harvard becomes more involved as the investigation continues.
“I knew Steve for 30 years, and I know that he would want an investigation that would find out as much as possible about the causes of this tragedy in hopes of preventing a reoccurrence,” De Gruttola said.
“I would also hope that Harvard would take an active interest in this investigation and how it proceeds.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Strumming a banjo and guitar, two Harvard undergraduates led a band of 30 through Harvard Yard yesterday afternoon, stopping at various landmarks to air employee concerns and honor University staff.
The group—which included Harvard students, faculty, and staff—aimed to remind the Harvard community of the impact of last year’s layoffs on current employees, such as heavier work loads, said Neal J. Meyer ’11, a Crimson photographer and a member of the Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, which organized the event.
Starting at Mass. Hall, the demonstrators first delivered a letter to University President Drew G. Faust requesting a meeting with 10 Harvard employees before making their way to Annenberg Dining Hall, the Center for Government and International Studies, Widener Library, and University Hall.
At each stop, the group left thank-you posters and several red long stem roses—a nod to the 1912 Bread and Roses strike of immigrant textile workers in Lawrence, Mass.—to show their respect for University staff.
“Harvard needs to not only give world-class treatment to only its students, but also its workers,” SLAM member Jane W. Williams ’13 said.
Group members also voiced concerns specific to employees working at each location.
For example, subcontracted janitors working at CGIS are currently without health insurance. The subcontractor, Eurest Services, has not found a new provider since discontinuing its current services, according to Service Employees International Union Local 615 organizer Daniel Brasil Becker.
On the steps of Widener, Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers representative Geoffrey Carens spoke out against what he called “the abuse of temporary employees,” claiming that the University is relying too heavily on temporary workers who do not receive the benefits that union workers are guaranteed.
Several students who were not affiliated with SLAM also marched with the group to show their support and appreciation for University staff.
“I felt like I needed to be here because I don’t really do much in my daily life to honor the workers here, who are the ones that keep this institution running,” Jonathan M. L. Rosenthal ’13 said.
To conclude the event, Reverend Jonathan C. Page, an Epps Fellow in Memorial Church, led the group in breaking bread outside University Hall to symbolize the basic sustenance that everyone needs.
“I think it’s important to support and show solidarity with the workers of this University,” Page said. “We need to advocate for those who tend to get hit the hardest—those at the bottom of the pay scale.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II, Part III, and Part IV of this story appeared on May 3, May 5, and May 7, 2010.)
 
Last spring, Ryan found himself outside late at night, alone with his boyfriend, who had just consumed nine shots of tequila.
The boyfriend tried to pressure him into performing sex acts Ryan said he was uncomfortable with, verbally and physically threatening him before finally punching Ryan in the face.
Ryan, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy, ran back to his room, devastated. The two broke up a few days later and have never talked about the confrontation.
Over the next semester, Ryan took circuitous routes across campus, avoiding buildings and people that reminded him of the “emotionally terrorizing” incident. He experienced panic attacks and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
As the purple stickers on the stall doors of many public bathrooms on campus read, Ryan is not alone.
Untold numbers of sexual assault cases go unreported every year on college campuses across the nation, and Harvard is no exception. Students, administrators, and specialists cite an array of obstacles that prevent the majority of victims from taking any formal action against their assailants.
Some of these barriers, such as students’ negative perception of the Administrative Board, are relatively unique to Harvard College, but many more are seen as unfortunate features inherent to the nature of sexual assault and the social stigmas surrounding it.
Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Director Sarah A. Rankin says she suspects the actual incidence of sexual assaults at Harvard is likely similar to national rates. Between 20 and 25 percent of college women and 4 percent of college men report being sexually assaulted during their college years, according to national statistics collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Justice.
But not every student who experiences sexual assault reports it. According to statistics submitted in accordance with the Clery Act—a federal statute mandating that colleges disclose information about crime on their campuses—an average of 20 to 30 cases of sexual assault a year are reported to administrators, House officers, and specialists at OSAPR and University Health Services. This statistic does not include sexual assaults confided to friends, family, or anonymously to peer counselors.
Of the minority of students who decide to confide in University staff and administrators, even fewer choose to take their case to any disciplinary body—be it the Ad Board or the criminal justice system.
The Ad Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—has heard only seven cases of sexual assault over the last five years, according to statistics provided by the College.
“The vast majority of the students that I talk to do not [formally] go to anybody,” says Rankin, adding that 90 percent of sexual assault cases go unreported.
AN EMOTIONAL PROCESS
Students and administrators say that some of victims’ reluctance to formally report sexual assault cases stems from what they see as a lengthy and emotionally painful Ad Board process with an uncertain outcome.
Ryan, who took a leave of absence soon after the incident, says he felt uncomfortable with the prospect of being “cross-examined” by others about his ordeal.
“Do I want to relive this in front of strangers over and over again?” Ryan says he asked himself at the time.
While all victims of sexual assault are likely to suffer from crippling emotional aftershocks, Harvard students—with their countless academic and extracurricular activities—may face an added burden when deciding whether to bring a case to the Ad Board or law enforcement.
“I’ve had students tell me that they stop and ask themselves whether they have time to go through the process of reporting—with courses, activities, a job, and the rest of their lives,” says Susan B. Marine, director of the Harvard Women’s Center and former director of OSAPR.
And of those who do initially decide to go forward, many are dissuaded by other difficulties in the Ad Board process.
After speaking with his resident dean about his experience, Ryan met with Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison to discuss the process.
But Ryan says he did not feel comforted by Ellison and other officials’ continued emphasis on the uncertainty of the outcome of the Ad Board’s decision.
Ad Board rulings in sexual assault cases have long been hindered by inadequate evidence, according to Jennifer Leaning, a human rights professor and chair of the Leaning Committee, which led a 2003 review of how the Ad Board has handled sexual assault cases.
Cases in which the Ad Board is unable to hand down a conclusion due to insufficient evidence result in a “take no action” ruling.
The Leaning Committee recommended the use of an independent fact-finder to more comprehensively investigate cases.
The fact-finder was, in part, meant to help reduce the number of cases that ended with the inconclusive “take no action” ruling.
But even the expertise of the fact-finders cannot completely overcome the inherent difficulty of proving the occurrence of a sexual assault, which often has no outside witnesses.
“At the end of the day, there were two people in the room,” Rankin says. “If it’s just [their] word against the other person’s word...[for the student], it can feel like a roll of the dice.”
Ryan says the knowledge that his case would likely end in an inconclusive ruling was a deal breaker for him, so he did not bring his case to the Ad Board.
“It wasn’t something I could go through emotionally,” he says. “That kind of non-ruling might as well have been a victory for him.”
KEEPING IT SECRET
In addition to having apprehensions about the Ad Board process, many victims’ privacy concerns deter them from bringing cases forward, administrators and specialists say.
Many students worry about the number of people with whom they will have to share their painful and often traumatizing stories, Ellison says. Moreover, victims many not want Faculty members with whom they have an academic relationship to know the details of their highly personal ordeal.
In part because of the stigma surrounding sexual assault, victims often worry that the intimate details of their case may be revealed to their friends, classmates, or even worse—the entire campus.
“At Harvard, there’s constant pressure to be strong, independent, and autonomous, and to have that taken away from you and to have that stigma on you is why some don’t report [their cases],’ said OSAPR Student Alliance member T. Truc Doan ’10.
Rankin said that Harvard undergraduates in particular are very concerned about their private information becoming public.
“Harvard students are pretty protective of their information and confidentiality,” Rankin says. “Even if it’s a private hearing, people feel like all their peers will know through the rumor mill.”
While victims are concerned that information about their cases may spread by word of mouth, administrators and students say victims have also decided not to go forward with cases in the past because of worries that The Crimson will cover their stories.
In February 2009, The Crimson published a story on a sexual assault that took place in a River House, based partially on information published in the Harvard University Police Department police blotter.
According to Ellison, there was enough evidence concerning that particular incident that an Ad Board case would likely have resulted in a disciplinary sanction. But he says the student ultimately decided not to pursue a formal complaint for fear that the case would be covered by The Crimson.
Crimson President Peter F. Zhu ’11 says that it is not the newspaper’s general policy to print victims’ names or identifying information in cases of sexual assault.
Zhu said he could not address The Crimson’s coverage of the alleged incident in February 2009 because he was not the publication’s president at the time.
“If we have reported irresponsibly in the past, that’s regrettable,” says Zhu. “Any reporter should always be a human being first and foremost.”
A MISPLACED RESPONSIBILITY
Victims are often motivated to keep their stories private out of a sense of personal “responsibility” that can accompany a sexual assault, Rankin says.
For example, Doan says the victim may feel partially at fault for drinking too much, wearing provocative clothing, or going out alone at night.
“It can feel very hard to...do something that will jeopardize [the assailant’s] future and their career at Harvard for an event that [the victim] feels is partially their fault,” Rankin says.
She adds that one of OSAPR’s goals is to counteract this self-blame.
The reluctance to affect the assailant’s future is exacerbated by the fact that the offender is someone the victim knows in approximately 90 percent of college sexual assault cases, according to statistics provided by OSAPR.
Doan says the assailant is often a close friend or romantic interest of the victim, which further complicates the victim-assailant paradigm.
The hesitancy to permanently affect the assailant’s future is more “acute” at Harvard, Ellison says, because Harvard students “see the degree as such a significant thing.”
THE VICTIM’S CHOICE
As students cite many reasons for not sharing their stories, Rankin says that it is important not to push them to formally report their experiences if they are uncomfortable doing so, even if their cases would likely result in an Ad Board sanction of the offender.
“After something like this, the last thing you need is people kind of pushing you around and telling you how to handle it,” she says.
Though Ellison agrees that administrators and specialists should remain non-directive, he says it is “regrettable” that students miss the opportunity to obtain administrative support by not coming forward, noting that the dearth of reported cases relates to misconceptions about the Ad Board.
“The process will be difficult, but not as difficult and horrible as they expect it to be,” Ellison says, adding that Ad Board members do their best to make the process as painless as possible for the victim while still accomplishing their task.
“In my opinion, the process is as well-constructed, humane, and supportive as it can possibly be” given the circumstances, Marine says.
Despite the numerous obstacles victims face after being sexually assaulted, administrators say they strive to improve the process and to encourage more victims to come forward.
“I wish that every student that had an encounter that was non-consensual would at least come talk to me so they could make the decision informed [about the Ad Board],” Ellison says. “My hope would be the result of that would be we’d get more cases.”

Lisa Hogarty will join Harvard’s central administration in the newly refashioned position of Vice President for Campus Services, the University announced yesterday.
Hogarty will take over an office that has been in flux since former Vice President for Administration Sally H. Zeckhauser stepped down in July 2009.
This year, several functions of the office have been transferred to other areas of the central administration, and streamlining of operations will continue now that a leader has been chosen, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp said earlier this week.
“I think when the choice is made and the person is on board, we’re going to have a really great opportunity to create synergy across service units,” Lapp said prior to the announcement of Hogarty’s appointment.
The University conducted a nationwide search for the position, according to Lapp, who added that each of the final candidates brought insight into how to make the University’s behind-the-scenes operations run more efficiently.
After Hogarty assumes the position in late June, her first priority will be to listen to her new colleagues, she said in an interview with The Crimson.
“During the interview process, I was so impressed with the operational excellence and level of customer service,” Hogarty said. “It’s not so much about streamlining but about, ‘How do we take advantage of these operations to create increased collaboration and coordination among units?’”
Hogarty’s new office will have a broad range of duties across the University, from dining and real estate to transportation and emergency management. Oversight of the Arnold Arboretum and Harvard University Press, formerly in the VPA’s portfolio, were transferred to the Provost’s Office in 2009.Hogarty said that her experience at Columbia University, where she was most recently chief operating officer of the university’s Medical Center, will help her manage these many functions. In her past role as executive vice president for student and administrative services at Columbia, Hogarty oversaw procurement and construction of a new teaching center and undergraduate housing.
Regarding the broad role she will assume at Harvard, Hogarty said teamwork is crucial.
“It’s all about the team that you assemble. My job to coordinate and make sure that people have the resources that they need,” she said.

The Harvard Black Men’s Forum honored former Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons yesterday during the group’s 16th annual Celebration of Black Women Banquet, which recognizes black women from both Harvard and the Cambridge community.
Celebration of Black Women Chair Jonathan Figueroa ’10 said that the event seeks to honor “extraordinary, strong, intelligent black women,” such as Simmons, “who’ve done significant work in the community.”
The Black Men’s Forum highlighted Simmons’s involvement with urban youth, African American organizations, small business owners, and civil and equal rights throughout her public service career.
As the first openly lesbian African American mayor in the country, Simmons described herself as representing three minorities.
“I have triple problems to pass,” she said.
Simmons said that it was “unthinkable” during her childhood for a black woman to aspire to be mayor of her city, and encouraged her young audience to focus on achieving their goals and recognizing the impact they can have on others.
“Don’t let people talk you out of doing what you want to do,” she said. “What young people are looking for is not role models but real models.”
While she said she was honored to serve as Cambridge’s mayor, she questioned why it took until 2008 for a “progressive city” like Cambridge to elect its first African American mayor.
“How long will it take for a female black president?” she added.
Brandon M. Terry ’05, former president of Black Men’s Forum, said he agreed with Simmons’s comments about the need for members of the Harvard black community to serve as role models for the larger black community.
“A lot of times we get wrapped in the [Harvard] bubble,” he said, emphasizing the need for the student body to be more engaged in their neighborhood.
In addition to Simmons, four graduating Harvard seniors—Omobolaji O. Ogunsola ’10, Chioma M. Achebe ’10, Saron A. Tesfalul ’10, and Jacqueline C. Hairston ’10—were also awarded a Senior Leadership Award at this event.

CORRECTION: April 30, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 30 news article "BMF Honors Former Cambridge City Mayor E. Denise Simmons" incorrectly stated that Mayor E. Denise Simmons is the first African American mayor of Cambridge. In fact, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, was the first African American mayor of the city. He served as mayor from 1992-1995 and from 2006-2007.

After successfully supporting two pilot parties this past month, the Undergraduate Council’s Student Initiated Programs Fund is under review before submission for final approval this summer.
The program, which funds medium-sized parties in the College’s undergraduate Houses and allots some funding for alcohol service, piloted two parties hosted in Quincy and Pforzheimer Houses. The events cost the UC about $400 apiece, though reimbursements have yet to be made, according to Mallika Khandelwal ’11, chair of the UC Student Initiatives Committee.
Ling Lin ’12 and Ryan K. Schell ’11, who both helped host the parties, said the events drew around 100 and 30 attendees, respectively. Khandelwal added that she was pleased with the turnout, but noted that changes will be made before the final proposal arrives on Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’ desk this summer.
Among the tweaks considered for the proposal’s review is a reduction in the amount of supervision at SIP-sponsored parties, Khandelwal said. The two pilot parties each had around five Senior Common Room members present, in addition to a Beverage Authorization Team and a Harvard University Police Department officer, according to Khandelwal and Schell.
“It was really excessive to have that many adults standing at the door,” Khandelwal said.
She added that the SIC is considering allowing some e-mail promotion over House lists as opposed to the current prohibition on advertising parties over public channels of communication.
Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke said that the grant approval process ought to be streamlined. Based on his experiences, Schell echoed that sentiment, emphasizing that fewer people should be involved in the process.
According to Schell, while trying to secure a SIP grant, he faced a panel of more than 10 UC representatives in the Quincy Dining Hall, who asked him questions about the implementation of his proposal.
But Schell, a co-chair of the Pforzheimer House Committee, said he did not mind the initial kinks if it means he has helped the program get off the ground.
“I really like the idea of UC-funded parties,” Schell said. “It helps us have a little more flexibility in the parties we can throw, and it empowers students who aren’t a part of HoCo to throw House-wide events.”
Lin, a Crimson business editor who co-hosted the “healthy eating and healthy drinking”-themed event in the Quincy JCR, called the application process “fast and painless.” When speaking with the Quincy House Masters, Lin said she hoped the program would continue.
“I told them that I really enjoyed that they supported student-initiated programming and throwing events in the House and in public spaces,” she said. “I hope they do it more in the future—but with less supervision so it can be more relaxed.”

Greece will likely recover from its financial meltdown—though the process may take decades, Harvard professors predict.
Though Greece has historically had high levels of debt compared to its general economic productivity—a situation only exacerbated by the ongoing financial recession—Harvard professors suggest that its economy is likely to stabilize to pre-recession levels over the coming years.
In 2000, in order to be accepted into the European Union, the country reported deficits below the EU cap of 3 percent of GDP by allegedly falsifying data, according to Luca Einaudi, a visiting scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
When opposition leader Geórgios Papandréou assumed the office of Prime Minister in October 2009, he revealed that the deficit was much greater than expected—four times greater than the EU cap, Einaudi said. Soon after this announcement, rating agencies—on edge as a result of the recession—began downgrading Greek’s credit rating. Currently, Greek credit is trading at junk level: the lowest credit rating possible.
The primary problem for Greece now is whether or not the country will be able to generate enough capital to pay back their short-term debt, said Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer in economics.
While Miron said he believes that it would be best to simply allow Greece to default on its debt and begin rebuilding its economy from scratch, other professors disagreed.
History Professor Charles S. Maier said a bailout—the likely course of action—would be ideal, as allowing Greece to default would likely result in massive inflation and skyrocketing unemployment rates, causing much turmoil.
According to Maier, even a little bit of help would go a long way in maintaining stability. He added that a failure to intervene in Greece’s lagging economy would be contrary to the EU’s commitment to aiding its less prosperous member states.
Einaudi echoed Maier’s recommendation, noting that “there is no other way than to lend money to Greece.”
“You have to do it because otherwise the situation really blows up, and once you have panic it become more expensive to salvage the situation,” Einaudi added. “It is always better to do it fast.”
Even if Greece is bailed out, Einaudi said that economic recovery will not be a speedy process, adding that it will take decades for Greece to fully recover.

Daniel Choi, a gay rights activist challenging the U.S. Army’s policy of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” spoke at the  Institute of Politics last night about the “furor” surrounding his arrest two weeks ago for chaining himself to the gates of the White House.
Choi, a former first lieutenant who served in Iraq from 2006 to 2007, said he was dismissed from the army after revealing his sexual orientation on “The Rachel Maddow Show” in March 2009.
In his talk entitled “Truth and Consequences: One Man’s Quest To Openly Serve His Country,” Choi discussed his struggle to both appeal his dismissal from the army and to protest its gay policy.
Introduced in 1993 as a compromise measure by then-President Bill Clinton, DADT prohibits officials from directly probing a service member’s sexual orientation, but allows action to be taken against service members who openly declare their sexuality, according to the Department of Defense website.
“The disaster of the ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy is what it does every single day in the heart of a soldier—it tells them that they should be ashamed,” Choi said. “One is forced not only into secrecy, but into shame. Deception is enforced; shame is enforced.”
Choi added that the policy not only affects individuals on a personal level, but also has implications for the army as a whole.
Nearly “13,500 soldiers have been dismissed as a result of the policy. But if you think about it, that is 13,500 units who have lost surgeons, translators, officers,” Choi said. “We are sending units overseas without the full armor and support owed to them.”
By not allowing citizens the right to serve openly in the U.S. military, Choi said that the government sends a message to the gay community that they should be ashamed and must hide their sexual orientation.
To address this problem, Choi added that he intends to work with members of the LGBT coalition to petition President Obama to repeal the policy.
“We are specifically pressuring the president to do everything he can to bring about change,” Choi said.
“We want him to make good on his promise—to finish what he so boldly and publicly started,” he added, referencing then-presidential candidate Obama’s campaign promise to repeal DADT.

More than 50 women and men formed a circle on the steps of Memorial Church last night, each clutching a tall white candle to represent their joint efforts to empower survivors of sexual violence and recognize the end of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
Participants in 10 “points of light” vigils at universities across the country—including Brown University, the University of Kansas, and Rutgers University—simultaneously lit candles that signified the process of building a community of support for survivors of sexual violence.
According to Sarah A. Rankin, director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, this is the first year that universities have planned to hold their vigils at the same time, adding that this move emphasizes the national importance of sexual assault awareness.
“A survivor of date rape created a foundation to bring unity to the different Take Back the Night efforts across the U.S.,” Rankin said, noting that Take Back the Night began as a march in which participants protested the fact that women are often not able to walk alone safely at night.
As the participants stood in silence clutching their candles, several stepped into the middle of the circle, where they shared personal stories of how their lives have been affected by sexual assault.
“It can be cathartic to talk openly about sexual assault in a calm, supportive environment,” OSAPR volunteer Ashlyn B. Garry ’10 said, adding that, “We don’t talk about sexual assault at Harvard, and sharing like this is a way to take the stigma away and make a more inclusive community of people who care.”
After sharing their stories, some members of the circle held hands, while other participants shed tears or smiled with relief.
Shannon E. Cleary ’12, a volunteer at OSAPR and chair of this year’s Take Back the Night activities, said that, in addition to addressing painful memories of sexual assault, creating a space for dialogue about these difficult issues can serve to help people understand the seriousness of sexual violence and ultimately inspire them to prevent it in the future.
“We are all affected by sexual violence, but all of us can be part of the solution,” she said, adding that talking about the problem and getting other community members involved is a step in the right direction.
Despite the somber tone of the evening, Cleary said that the vigil aimed to conclude Sexual Assault Awareness Month on a positive note.
“Tonight is about acknowledging pain and hurt and violation, but it’s also a celebration,” she said. “We are celebrating recovery, and we are celebrating hope.”
As the sun set and the wind picked up, many attendees clasped their coats around them and huddled close with their friends, leaning their faces toward the warmth of their candles.
“The light shows that we’re all standing here together,” Garry said, adding that, “It sends a powerful message that we care.”

Lechmere Square may undergo a makeover in the near future.
The East Cambridge Planning Team Lechmere Square working group is calling for the renovation of the space the Lechmere Station currently occupies.
Last fall, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority proposed the extension of the Green Line beyond Lechmere Station into Somerville and Medford, Mass. As a result, Lechmere Station will relocate to the east side of the Monsignor O’Brien Highway.
The new station is projected to open at the end of 2014.
The ECPT working group said it hopes the area currently occupied by the station will be transformed into an open plaza surrounded by retail spaces.
According to the working group’s proposal, the train shelter would be converted into a canopy for an outdoor seasonal market. On the other side, the bus depot would be renovated into an enclosed, year-round farmer’s market.
In addition, the group critiqued the openness of the entrance area of the new Lechmere station, which could potentially expose waiting passengers to adverse weather and bus traffic. The group suggested erecting a building to house the Charlie Card machines and entrance turnstiles.
The group also recommended the construction of a 12- to 14-story building in the triangular parcel of land adjacent to the proposed plaza. The building—likely to be a hotel—will serve as a “cash cow” for the Square and promote pedestrian traffic in the area, according to Barbara Broussard, president of the ECPT.
At a city council meeting earlier this year, residents of East Cambridge expressed their approval for the proposal, which they said would encourage greater foot traffic and serve to augment retail spaces.
“When has a community come to you and said, ‘Build me a 12-story hotel?’ Never.” Broussard said about the unprecedented support in the community for such significant urban planning measures.
“There has been no one that said the idea was a pie in the sky.”
The ECPT working group—which is currently looking to garner sponsorship for its proposal—has met with the Secretary of Transportation, the Cambridge City Manager, and representatives from the MBTA and MassDOT to discuss its plans, according to Broussard.
A feasibility study regarding the ECPT proposal will be conducted this summer, as commissioned by the Cambridge City Council in March. Subsequently, a preliminary report will be drafted by September, according to Susan Glazer, deputy director of the Cambridge Community Development Department.

The Afghan filmmaker and novelist Atiq Rahimi spoke about transnational identity and cultural revolution yesterday in a Humanities Center presentation called “From Political Exile to Poetic Wandering.”
Rahimi, who now divides his time between Paris and Kabul, encountered complex issues of language and expression after fleeing Afghanistan for France in 1984. Such an experience of geographical displacement can intensify artistic drive, Rahimi said.
Yesterday’s discussion was part of the France in the World seminar, which this year focuses on foreign-born Francophone authors living in France.
“We are interested in how he has turned his political exile into what he calls poetic nomadism, how he moves between countries, languages, culture and media,” said Kirkland House Master Verena Conley, one of the seminar leaders and a long-term visiting professor of romance languages and literatures.
Rahimi recounted his arrival in Paris, when he spoke no French and found no use for his native Persian. He said he turned to the world of film.
“I was looking for another language, a language that was accessible to me, and that was images,” he said through a translator, his publisher Judith Gurewich.
Rahimi suggested that his wandering was at once physical and artistic. After studying film at the Sorbonne, and releasing more than 20 documentaries, he began to write novels in Persian. His first novel in French, “Singue Sabour” (“Stone of Patience”), earned him the Goncourt Prize in 2008.
The visiting polymath—Rahimi also speaks Urdu and some English—spoke of his most recent project in his homeland. As creative advisor to Afghanistan’s largest media group, Rahimi trains young filmmakers and has led the development of the country’s first soap opera.
To bring about political change in his country, Rahimi insisted that Afghanistan needs a cultural revolution led by youth and artists. His real goal was “to use television as a tool for education, because this was a way to reach people who don’t know how to read and write,” Rahimi said through a translator.
Javed Rezayee, an Afghan student in his senior year at Tufts, said he was highly impressed.
“It’s great to see Afghans and diaspora doing something good for the country, so I’m proud,” he said.

In a blustery battle of cross-town rivals, the Harvard softball team (22-21, 13-3 Ivy) fell to Boston University (27-18, 10-2 America East) yesterday, 4-1, at Soldiers Field in the Crimson’s final non-conference matchup of the regular season.
The Terriers came out strong against Harvard, scoring all four of their runs in first three innings.
The Crimson experienced a game-long scoring drought, which, though interrupted briefly by a homer from sophomore first baseman Whitney Shaw in the fourth inning, made it impossible for Harvard to recover from the early deficit.
“Their pitchers really silenced our bats,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “We didn’t start battling at the plate until the fourth inning, and we gave some at-bats away.”
In the fourth inning, an impressive at-bat by co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson editor, helped the team gain momentum.
After Schellberg was tagged out at first on a nice play by the Terriers’ shortstop, Shaw slammed one over the fence for the only score on the day.
Freshman Jess Ferri singled to get on base immediately following Shaw’s home run. Senior outfielder Jen Francis hit a double, putting runners on second and third for the Crimson, but Harvard was unable to capitalize further.
“We really started to come together and battle harder [in the fourth],” Allard said. “We need to do that from the first inning.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the scoring did not continue, as Shaw’s home run was the last run scored by either team in the seven-inning matchup.
Harvard had few scoring chances in the last portion of the game, as BU’s pitching staff held the Crimson to no hits and only 10 batters in the last three innings.
Despite the loss, pitching was a strong point for Harvard.
Sophomore pitcher Julia Moore got the Crimson off to a good start, allowing no hits in the first inning.
Co-captain Margaux Black entered the game for Harvard in the fourth inning and shut down the Terrier offense, allowing just two hits and no runs in the remainder of the game.
“I’m a ground-ball pitcher, and they hit a lot of ground balls today,” Black said. “I had our defense backing me up…[It would be nice] to see a little more offense, but I think our defense played great.”
The Terriers scored their first run in the second inning, as sophomore shortstop Emily Roesch crossed home plate on a single from freshman pitcher Whitney Tuthill.
Trouble for the Crimson came in the third inning, as a big hit by Roesch sent home BU sophomore second baseman Erica Casacci and senior first baseman Rachel Hebert.
The Terriers stretched their lead to 4-0 due to a fielding error on a Tuthill pop-up that sent senior third baseman Rachel Moeller home.
“BU’s a good hitting team,” Allard said. “They scored a couple of runs, and we had some missed plays in the third inning that gave them a couple of runs too.”
The rivalry between BU and Harvard is a longstanding tradition, with the squads meeting twice a season each year.
“We have a great rapport with [BU],” Allard said. “They’re a good hitting ballclub; they’ve always had great pitching and good defense.”
Both the Terriers and the Crimson sit atop the standings in their respective conferences.
Harvard will take on Dartmouth this weekend in a doubleheader to decide the winner of the Ivy League North Division, and the team that will advance to the Ivy League Championship Series.
The Terriers lead the America East Conference, one game ahead of their next opponent, Maine.
“I think they’re a really solid club,” Allard said. “I’m glad that they’re our neighbors and we get to play them a lot, because they make us better.”

The Ivy League championship hangs in the balance for the Harvard softball team (22-20, 13-3 Ivy), as it prepares to take on Dartmouth this weekend in a pair of doubleheaders.
The Big Green (13-22, 10-4) and the Crimson will play for control of the Ivy League North Division, the winner of which will go on to face the leader of the South Division for the Ancient Eight title.
For Dartmouth, which was defeated by Cornell in last year’s best-of-three Championship Series, beating Harvard this weekend is a crucial step towards gaining redemption.
But for the Crimson, which holds a two-game lead over its league rival, the doubleheaders provide an opportunity to clinch the division and set up a title bout.
“It’s a huge weekend for us,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “This is what we’ve been playing for, what our season is all about.”
“Our goal has been to be in the conference race in the last weekend,” coach Jenny Allard added. “We’re in a great position now, but the games will be a battle.”
Both teams are coming off of recent losses—the Big Green having split a makeup doubleheader with Brown, and Harvard having lost, 4-1, in a non-conference game against Boston University yesterday afternoon.
The Crimson, led by standout sophomore hurler Rachel Brown, acknowledges both the importance of the final series of the regular season and the strength of its adversary.
“We’re going to have to come out with a lot of energy,” the sophomore said. “Dartmouth is always a great series because they’re great opponents.”
The reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year, Brown has played a big role in Harvard’s domination of its division.
Currently holding a 14-5 record on the year with 206 strikeouts, she has been named the league’s Pitcher of the Week three times already this season and shows no sign of slowing down.
Besides relying on Brown’s stellar arm, the Crimson has also recently found success at the plate, generating offense up and down the lineup.
“We’re really peaking now, and this is the right time in the season to do that,” Brown said. “We’ve had some really strong showings, and everyone’s excited to continue this weekend.”
Though Harvard has received much of its batting power from sophomore slugger Whitney Shaw—who has a team-high 10 home runs—it has used a team-wide offensive effort to score at least one run in the squad’s last nine games.
“The offense has been coming on very strong in the last few weeks, and we have to keep that help,” Black said.
But to win against Dartmouth and take the division, the Crimson will have to combine all aspects of the sport along with the raw desire to reach the Championship Series.
“We’re going to have to have some dominant pitching, great defense, and timely hitting to win,” said Brown. “We have to play Harvard softball; we have to play our game.”
One thing going for Harvard in the first doubleheader is home-field advantage.
Because the Crimson needs only two wins to take the division, it could potentially lock up the needed victories before leaving Cambridge.
“It’s exciting that we have a chance to win it at home on Saturday,” Brown said. “The weather and the crowd would make for perfect softball.”
The wins and the trip to the Championship Series would be especially meaningful to the six seniors on the squad, who began their careers with an Ivy title.
“It would be a dream come true as a senior to go to the Championship again,” Black said. “We’ve been hungry for another opportunity since my freshman year.”
Even with the title in sight, the Harvard squad remains focused on the task at hand.
“Winning the North Division is what we’re concerned with right now,” Black said, “but after we do that, we’re going to look to the next step.”
“[The girls] just needs to continue to do what they has done all year,” Allard added. “They have to take one pitch at a time…and stay fired up.”

Win and they’re in.
It’s as simple as that for the members of the No. 19 Harvard men’s lacrosse team, which closes out its regular season tomorrow afternoon with a must-win game at archrival No. 17 Yale, where a spot in the first-ever Ivy League tournament will be on the line.
Only four conference teams will qualify for the Ivy tournament, the winner of which will gain an automatic spot in the 16-team NCAA tournament.
For the Crimson (6-5, 2-3 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (9-2, 3-2), a defeat tomorrow—barring an at-large bid for either team—would dash all hopes of playing in the postseason.
“It’s the most important game we’ll play all year,” co-captain Jason Duboe said. “A lot of emotion will definitely come out on both sides.”
The Bulldogs are coming off a home loss to Bryant but can still clinch a share of the Ivy title with a win combined with a Princeton loss.
After keeping their tournament hopes alive by upsetting the No. 6 Tigers last weekend, Harvard will need an equally strong performance if it is to put together its first winning streak since mid-March and earn a spot in the Ancient Eight tournament.
Much of that burden will fall on Harry Krieger, the Crimson’s inconsistent freshman goaltender, who will need to repeat a strong performance against the Tigers in which he only gave up seven goals.
Krieger will be going up against a Bulldog offense that is fifth in the Ivy with 10.50 goals per game and fifth in shot percentage at .292.
The Yale attack is led by junior Brian Douglass and sophomore Matt Gibson. Douglass ranks third in the conference with 29 goals, while Gibson is third in points per game.
Senior Brendan Gibson has contributed 31 points as well.
For both teams, offensive production this season has been a study in contrasts.
The Bulldogs have outscored their opponents in the first quarter 36-22, but they have been outscored 38-28 in the fourth.
Harvard has been outscored 38-28 in the first period, but it has outscored its opponents in the fourth 33-29.
In the event that the Crimson fall behind early—a tendency of the team this season—it should have ample opportunity to make a late run.
Harvard will look for continued offense from sources other than sophomore Jeff Cohen and junior Dean Gibbons, who have each scored 25 goals on the year, accounting for 41% of the team’s scores this season.
Sophomore Kevin Vaughan has increased his production of late and had three goals against Princeton.
“I think our game against Princeton was evidence that when we work together as a unit great things happen,” Duboe said. “Our production will be a result of how well we play as a unit, not necessarily any individual performances. If we stick to the fundamentals and execute, things should take care of themselves.”
The Crimson will face a difficult task in trying to score against Bulldog junior goalie Johnathan Falcone, who leads the Ivy in goals against average with 8.71 allowed per game.
But a large part of that statistic has to do with the fact that the Yale defense allows the fewest number of shots of any team in the conference.
“Yale has a young but solid defense,” junior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “We’ve just got to execute; it’s always a question of whether we can fulfill our gameplan.”
The Bulldogs excel when the ball is on the ground.
They lead the Ancient Eight in ground balls per game with 32.6 and have the best faceoff percentage in the conference at 55.5%.
Harvard hopes to counter with another strong performance from freshman midfielder Alex White, who won 12 faceoffs and grabbed eight ground balls against the Tigers.
The Crimson is 5-1 on the year when it snags more ground balls than its opponents.
“It’s really just a mentality when you go into games,” said Parchman, who is first on the team in faceoffs won. “It’s not the person who has the better stick skills or has better position, it’s the person who wants the ground ball or the faceoff more who gets it.”
Last season, Harvard beat Yale, 13-8, in a game in which Cohen had five goals.
The Bulldogs lead the historic rivalry, which began in 1882, 57-32. But few—if any—of those match-ups have ever been as important as tomorrow’s.
If Yale wins, the contest will mark the end of solid Harvard careers for midfielders Travis Burr and Duboe—a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award—and defensemen Billy Geist and Ben Smith, among other seniors.
But the team doesn’t plan to have their seasons end on a sour note.
“Lacrosse means the world to this senior class and every guy on the team, so we don’t want it to end,” Duboe said. “The games that we’ll play in the future don’t really matter, the games that we won in the past don’t matter. It all comes down to this game.”

Have an epic Assassin’s kill to share? You can still submit your story for the chance to be Harvard’s Top Assassin! This week, we share with you a submission from Luke A. Salisbury '12 that shows that a true assassin will use everything from nunchucks to nudity—whatever it takes to get the job done.
If you had looked carefully toward Old Quincy, entryway D at around 9:45 p.m. on April 15, you could have caught a glimpse of the greatest naked assassination of 2010. This battle took place between two agents who were close friends, 00 agents, and roommates. The victim was Jacob M. Viramontes '12, the 00 agent for team Quantom of Panic. The assailants consisted of the the team Bloodbath and Beyond (BBB), which included Agent Neil T. "Classy" Curran '12, Agent Collin A. "Kooky" Jones '12 , and Agent Luke A. "Mountain Main" Salisbury '12.
At 9:49 p.m., Agent Salisbury stripped off every article of clothing (Quincy Assassins rule #11, "The Naked Rule," states that a player who is entirely naked may not be shot) and boldly walked into entryway D. Private intelligence provided by a non-player informed BBB that Agent Viramontes was in room D-14 (an unsafe territory for all players involved), waiting for Salisbury to try entering D-13, the room he shares with Viramontes. Salisbury walked to his room and pretended to try the door, luring Viramontes out of D-14. Agents Curran and Jones were close behind, up against the wall of the hallway and out of range of any potential shots from Viramontes.
After several failed (and illegal) attempts to kill the safe and naked Salisbury, Viramontes leaned too far out of D-14 and was promptly attacked and killed by Jones' melee weapon. At this point, Viramontes sheepishly walked out of D-14, acknowledging his death and congratulating BBB.
Salisbury, willing to expose himself for the sake of the team—choosing to go balls to the wall for Quincy Assassins—had made this fantastic attack possible.
Team Bloodbath and Beyond, congratulations on the ingenious kill. This and other entries are in the running for Harvard’s Top Assassin. Submit your story now!
