After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes” – Benjamin Franklin
In Cambridge, it’s come to feel like we can add one more certainty to the list: Harvard’s tuition going up year after year.
Last April, Harvard announced that it would raise the yearly cost of attending the College to $60,659—a 3.5 percent jump from the year before. 2014 saw similar tuition growth (3.9 percent), as did 2013 (3.5 percent), 2012 (3.5 percent), and 2011 (3.8 percent). This trend more or less holds true all the way back to when tuition was just $150 in 1870, with each recent increase well outpacing inflation.
Though never specifying their reasons, the University has sought to justify each tuition increase by a doubling down on financial aid and a guarantee that no student will be unable to attend Harvard for financial reasons. The headline every year in the University-published Harvard Gazette reads something like: “Harvard announces tuition increase, rise in aid.”
And the University presents statistics to boot: Over 70 percent of families receive some amount of aid; the average family on aid pays $12,000 annually; a family making less than $65,000 doesn’t pay a dime. By coupling tuition and financial aid growth, the University has avoided any backlash to rising costs.
However, there are underlying problems with raising tuition for which financial aid cannot compensate.
Each year, Harvard Admissions sends officers across the country, hires student ambassadors, and floods high school students’ emails and mailboxes to get the word out about Harvard’s generous financial aid. The goal: to attract the most socioeconomically diverse class possible—something that Harvard deems central to its mission.
But at the same time, significant confusion hangs over the college admissions and financial aid processes.
When it comes to financial aid, each university has its own net price calculator, its own forms, and its own vague literature. On top, high school students and their families juggle essays, standardized tests, interviews, and visits—not to mention their regular coursework and extracurriculars.
Study after study has thus evidenced the amount of misinformation surrounding the process, which leads families to overestimate the cost of attending college. One University of Southern California and Sallie Mae Fund survey found that less than 20 percent of Hispanic young adults in California have an accurate perception of college’s costs.
Therefore, a higher sticker price for Harvard’s tuition only cements the image of Harvard as a place for the few and far between—for the students and families that can “afford” a top-tier education.
This is the basic assumption of the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket for the Board of Overseers, which has recently gained attention for its platform to eliminate undergraduate tuition altogether.
“If Harvard eliminated tuition, very quickly almost everyone in America would know about it, and a lot less affluent families… would suddenly consider Harvard for the first time,” said Ron Unz, one of the campaign’s candidates.
In addition, “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” recognizes the interests of the 30 percent of students whose families aren’t on financial aid.
These aren’t just multi-millionaires; the cutoff for financial aid hovers around an annual income of $250,000. After taxes, Harvard’s $60,000-plus tuition could mean over a third of a family’s income.
In this case, over 3 percent in tuition growth is no easy adjustment. These are people already making significant financial sacrifices to send their children to college, and Harvard continues to squeeze these individuals for more money, leaving them waiting to qualify for aid themselves.
Granted, tuition growth is not easy to solve, and it’s not just Harvard’s problem. It’s a national epidemic, with tuition rising at six times the rate of inflation per one estimate.
But Harvard is in a unique position to change its own course. Harvard has a $37.6 billion endowment, the interest of which alone could fund every undergraduate’s education in full.
With regards to the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign, the University quickly reminded everyone that the endowment is not the free-for-all bank account that we like to imagine. Said University spokesperson Jeff Neal: “In reality, Harvard’s flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it must be maintained in perpetuity and that it is largely restricted by the explicit wishes of those who contributed the endowed funds.”
Yet there is a large difference between seeking free tuition and an end, or at least a slowdown, to tuition’s growth. If Harvard has good faith and rightly perceives its long-term interests, it should look to rein in tuition.
Until then, we students can expect an announcement soon about tuition hikes for next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of Harvard’s Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, community, we have become painfully aware of the toll that stress and mental illness have taken on our peers and ourselves. We have noticed a worrying trend in recent years of Asian and Asian American suicides and an increasing number of our friends taking time off. We have noticed, too, the struggles of a healthcare and administrative system where our cultural perspective is often misunderstood. In sharing our experiences, we hope to bring these perspectives to light and to advocate for a more culturally sensitive approach to mental health services.
For many of us from East Asian immigrant households, holiday potlucks are not only a time of celebration, but also an occasion for parents to gossip about the younger generation and to engage in competitions to see whose child is better—an environment that leaves little room for weakness. This pride dictates the topics of conversation during both social gatherings and family discussions at home: College acceptances? Yes. Grades? Only if they're good. Doubts and emotional vulnerability? Not always. This preoccupation with perfection made it difficult to show signs of insecurity or fault, including internal struggles with mental illness.
A similar lack of attention towards mental health is also apparent in many South Asian families. Sara Surani ‘18 remembers conversations at home about mental illness being met with glib responses: "Oh, you think you're depressed. No, no, you just haven't been sleeping enough. You're not depressed; you are tired."
"Anxiety? Oh, no, that just means that you are not working hard enough so you are worried. Work harder, it will get better."
She recalls hearing stories of suicide—friends and family ending their lives for various reasons. However, just as shocking as the suicide itself was the community’s response: the conversation immediately shifted to the shame and disgrace brought upon the individual’s family and community.
This stigma around mental illness is ingrained into the very languages spoken in immigrant households. The Chinese phrase for mental illness (shénjīngbìng) is synonymous in many minds with violent psychosis; for Korean families, preserving family honor sometimes meant sequestering mentally ill members from society—one in which the term for a mentally ill patient (jungshinbyungja) can be used insultingly. The word for suicide in Urdu/Hindi, "khud kushi," is often mistakenly understood and pronounced as "khud khushi" or "self-happiness," perhaps because suicide is viewed as a selfish act.
These cultural contexts, which often make it difficult for students to find support among family, may explain the broader status of AAPI mental health. Studies show that Asian American students have a higher rate of depression than white students, yet are also one of the ethnicities least likely to seek mental health care. (These aggregate statistics may mask disparities in subpopulations such as Southeast Asians, who experience high levels of poverty and high-school dropout rates, as well as Pacific Islanders, who often have nuanced cultural backgrounds closer to that of indigenous peoples.)
The unique circumstances faced by members of the AAPI community necessitate a tailored response. There are evidence-based benefits in hiring psychologists and clinicians with diverse backgrounds to match Harvard’s diverse student population, and such diversification efforts need to be coupled with greater outreach and training for cultural and religious groups to create a stronger support system for underserved populations. This might entail clinician and cultural group meetings each semester to share resources and establish relationships. Longer-term initiatives, such as the creation of a multicultural center (similar to Yale's), will be vital for creating permanent support for minority communities.
The burden does not fall entirely on the administration. We as students need to continue striving for a more open and inclusive environment for discussion of mental health concerns; AAPI alumni can help advocate for improved methods and push for more AAPI counselors and psychotherapists at UHS; counselors and professionals with an understanding of the AAPI context can continue to lend their guidance to students.
We’ve worked with a number of Harvard-affiliated professionals who have provided such guidance, including Francis Chen of HUHS, Dr. Cindy Liu, the Director of Multicultural Research at the Commonwealth Research Center, Dr. Rohit Chandra of MGH and the Indo-American Psychiatric Association, and Meagan Moana Palelei HoChing, an E3! Ambassador working with the White House Initiative on AAPIs. Our four contacts are happy to meet with students and to connect them with additional local AAPI mental health care contacts and resources. And as always, resources are available through the house and student communities and for urgent care.
The diversity of viewpoints represented among students of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage is incredible. We recognize that we have not captured the full nuance of mental health within this community; nonetheless, our hope in sharing our perspectives is to continue the ongoing dialogue and to fight for a community of students, alumni, and staff that will address these challenges unwaveringly. We welcome readers to reach out with their own stories and ideas on how we can all continue to work to recognize the role of identity and ethnicity in mental health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the 2016 election season ramps up, Harvard Law professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 finds himself at the center of a political firestorm.
Over the past month, Republican presidential hopeful and Law School graduate Ted Cruz denounced his former constitutional law professor Tribe as “a left-wing judicial activist” while speaking in a mid-January Republican debate, while rival candidate Donald J. Trump has tweeted and debated in support of Tribe.
The focus on Tribe stemmed from a widely-cited op-ed he penned in The Boston Globe earlier this month titled “Under Ted Cruz’s own logic, he’s ineligible for the White House.” In the article, Tribe calls into question Cruz’s consistency in interpreting the Constitution. 
Cruz—a known “originalist” who interprets the Constitution based on the intent of its framers—was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father. Tribe wrote that originalists would argue the Constitution’s framers likely intended  “natural born”—a constitutional prerequisite for becoming U.S. president—to mean physically born in the United States. By these standards, he continued, Cruz should be ineligible to hold the nation’s highest office.
The op-ed brought Tribe national attention as Cruz and Trump briefly sparred during a televised Republican debate, arguing about Tribe’s position and motivations for writing the op-ed. Before the debate, Cruz’s campaign published a memo attacking Tribe, Cruz’s former professor.
Tribe insists that his motivations were not political; despite airing his liberal views openly, Tribe has not endorsed a candidate. Furthermore, he maintains that according to his own “living constitutionalist” method of interpretation—a more flexible reading of the Constitution—Cruz should be able to run for the presidency.
“Larry Tribe is presumably on the whole a liberal, but he’s just sort of throwing a little gasoline on a fire that’s basically going on among Republicans,” said Government professor Theda R. Skocpol, who studies American politics.
Tribe is accustomed to fielding calls from politicians, lawyers, and journalists seeking his take on national controversies involving constitutional interpretation. In 2008, Tribe defended the eligibility of then-presidential candidate John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone to two American parents. This election season, Tribe said he had begun receiving calls about Cruz’s eligibility to run, but he was initially reluctant to interfere with the aspirations of a former student.
Still, Tribe said he decided to comment after he felt that Cruz’s defense of his presidential right was hypocritical.
Tribe said he is not particularly invested in the question of natural born citizenship. Rather, Tribe said, his main interest is in “the Constitution and my sense of how dangerous it is when people play fast and loose with it in order to further their political positions.”
Cruz, who has consistently touted originalist positions throughout his career in law and politics, continues to maintain that he is eligible to be president.
In a prepared statement, the Cruz campaign also maintained that Cruz is eligible to be president, regardless of his birthplace, because his mother was a citizen at the time of his birth.
Trump seized on Tribe’s arguments during the Republican debate to denounce his closest competitor.
“Stranger things have happened,” Tribe said on becoming part of Trump’s political artillery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six new resident fellows, including Christopher W. Smart, former special assistant to the President for international economics, and Annise D. Parker, former mayor of Houston, Tex., will join the Institute of Politics and host weekly study groups this spring.
The fellows—Karin L. Agness, president of Network of enlightened Women; Anurima Bhargava ’96, chief of the Educational Opportunities Section of the Department of Justice; Anne A. Hawley, former director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; Parker; Smart; and Peter J. Westmacott, a British ambassador to the United States—will stay at Harvard, where they will run study groups for undergraduates, through the semester.
Two visiting fellows—former U.S. ambassador to China and secretary of Commerce Gary F. Locke and U.S. ambassador to Portugal Gerald S. McGowan—will also be at the IOP during the semester. Although they will not run study groups, Locke and McGowan will host periodic discussions when they are on campus.
“The fellowship program is the cornerstone program of the IOP,” Eric R. Andersen, director of the IOP’s fellows and study groups, said. “The idea behind the fellowship is to bring in political practitioners who are at the top of their game and have been highly successful, who can explain, teach, and coach students to follow a path similar to their own.”
The IOP staff and the undergraduate student advisory committee choose the fellows each year. The group received more than 30 fellow applicants, Andersen said.
IOP Director Margaret A. “Maggie”  Williams said in a statement that the new fellows are  “a dynamic group of leaders reflecting the powerful impact political engagement can have both inside and outside government.”
Agness started the Network of enlightened Women, an organization geared towards young conservative women, while an student at the University of Virginia. Agness said she hopes to work with students who want to start their own organizations.
“My study group is going to focus on political entrepreneurship,” she said. “I want to share with students what I’ve learned starting an organization in college that I’ve turned into a national organization.”
Bhargava said her experiences on the IOP’s student advisory committee as an undergraduate helped inspire her career in public service. Her study group will focus on issues of gender and race in higher education.
Hawley, who was director of  the Gardner museum for more than two decades, wants to look at the intersection of art and public policy. Her study groups will range from looking at “how architecture and public spaces create identity for cities” to “how artists produce social change.”
Smart plans to center his study group around the same issues he focused on in government: international economic and finance problems.
“It’s really meant to examine how political leaders work together, try to work together, to support economic growth around the world, even as they have to answer for the concerns of their own voters,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Asbestos found in Harvard building materials recently forced at least one undergraduate to temporarily relocate out of his room in Winthrop House, although administrators say current levels of the fibrous material pose no health problems to students.
Last semester, after arriving back to his dorm, Winthrop resident Matthew W.G. Walker ’16 said he noticed a chunk of plaster had fallen from the ceiling into his closet, scattering dust over his clothes. The next day, Winthrop House staff and facility workers tested the plaster and found levels of asbestos in the material, according to Walker.
Winthrop House Masters Stephanie Robinson and Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. wrote in a statement that standards of construction for older buildings are to blame for the presence of asbestos, which was frequently used for fireproofing and insulation throughout the twentieth century.
“Asbestos has been found in rooms at Winthrop House, either during repair work or during episodes where something breaks and materials behind the wall are exposed,” they wrote, adding that no students or staff members in the House are exposed to asbestos in ways that would break building codes.
Zachary M. Gingo, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Senior Director of Facilities Operations, said unless asbestos is made “friable," or into a powder, the substance is not dangerous.
“In order to make sure that that does not happen on campus, we have specific maintenance protocols for avoiding the damage or disturbance of potentially asbestos-containing materials,” Gingo wrote in an email.
He added that Harvard hires “third-party experts” to remove asbestos—a known carcinogen—and follows strict safety standards to ensure that no contaminants remain exposed.
For Walker, the asbestos posed more of an annoyance than a health threat: he threw away all of his belongings and clothing in the closet—some of which Walker said had sentimental value—and moved to another location for a brief time.
“At first I was really disappointed that Winthrop wouldn’t have notified us [of the asbestos],” he said.
Although Walker said Winthrop staff repaired the closet and ensured other rooms in his suite were asbestos-free, he said disposing of his belongings was “a big mess.”
Walker said the incident demonstrated that the more than century year-old house is in need of renovations. Winthrop is set to be renewed during the 2016-2017 academic year; Gingo wrote that workers remove all asbestos “that could be disturbed” during renovations.

Local residents expressed anger and frustration at a public forum where the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority introduced proposals that would significantly alter, or potentially eliminate, MBTA’s late night weekend service.
According to the MBTA, the net cost per-passenger is $1.43 during regular service hours compared to $13 per-passenger during late night hours due to the lower number of riders. The overall cost for the late-night service is $14 million, according to an MBTA presentation. 
The entire system is struggling with soaring debt and public critique, public records have shown. At the meeting, held Wednesday night in Cambridge’s City Hall, MBTA Assistant General Manager Charles Planck offered two proposals to cut costs: provide service through a third-party contractor at a reduced rate, or eliminate the service entirely.
The removal of the late night program, known for its popularity among college-age residents, would lead to T service ending at 12:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. The T currently ends service around 2:00 a.m. on weekends.
“There is consistent use of the service, but it is not growing,” said Planck, who facilitated previous meetings in the Greater Boston Area.
But many of the young adult attendees voiced concerns about cutting late-night transportation. Some worried for workers in service industries that rely on late-night transportation, the environmental impact of cutting public transit, and the potential threat to Boston’s perception as a bustling city.
“I think sometimes the city, when we make a step forward to becoming a major market city, we take two steps back,” local resident Jonathan Alves said “This excuse and this idea that we can’t come up with 14 million dollars to subsidize a service is ridiculous.”
Cambridge City Councillor Jan Devereux, who also attended the meeting, said she was unsure if the service should be cut despite the financial cost.
“I realize that from an economic standpoint, late night service isn’t paying its own way,” she said. “But I do question whether that’s the appropriate way to look at a public good, which is public transit.”
Others questioned the data Planck presented, fearing that the numbers were misrepresented.
“I think that you’ve cherry-picked information on the slides,” Susan J. Ringler ’74 said. She and other attendees argued that the city was not considering other low-traffic times.
Attendees also proposed several ways the MBTA could reduce its deficit, such as increasing the cost of monthly passes or more vigorously advertising the late-night service.
Late night service has a tumultuous history in Massachusetts. Under former Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, late night weekend T service was extended in 2014 to 3:00 a.m. in a pilot program designed to improve service for college students in the Greater Boston area. Just one year later, the program faced an uncertain future after city officials introduced similar proposals to shut down the program. Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 began the process of reforming the MBTA in May when he outlined options in a letter to the Massachusetts State Legislature.
Last month, a Harvard Kennedy School fellow offered his own plan to help the MBTA remain solvent, which included recommendations to cut late night T service.
The MBTA’s Fiscal Management and Control Board will vote on the proposals in the spring. Officials will host future public meetings and online forums, where residents can comment on the proposals.

Colleges should dramatically alter their admissions practices with a new focus on promoting service, reducing academic and extracurricular stresses, and increasing student diversity, argued writers of a report released Wednesday by Graduate School of Education researchers.
Richard Weissbourd, a long-time GSE lecturer within the school’s “Making Caring Common” project, a research group focused on child development, was the primary author of the report, titled “Turning the Tide.” The report received endorsements from more than 80 administrators across dozens of universities, including professors and administrators at Harvard.
“Turning the Tide’s emphasis on the common good resonates strongly with the mission of Harvard College,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, who endorsed the report,  wrote in a statement.
The 32-page finalized report, planning for which began in 2014, makes a number of recommendations that, if adopted by individual colleges and universities, could have resounding effects on higher education admissions practices. The report’s authors call on admissions officers to emphasize that they expect successful students to perform community service in high school and focus on the quality, rather than number, of extracurricular activities. 
“Turning the Tide is the first step in a two-year campaign that seeks to substantially reshape the existing college admissions process,” the report’s authors wrote in a press release.
The report recommends that universities take concrete steps to reduce the pressure placed on high school applicants. It specifically suggests admissions offices discourage students from overloading with too many extracurricular activities and Advanced Placement classes. The report also recommends that colleges work to relieve the pressure associated with standardized testing, such as by “discouraging students from taking an admissions test more than twice.”
Since its conception, the report drew on the endorsements and research of dozens of administrators and admissions officers. At an initial meeting in 2014, “administrators and scholars from all over the country met to discuss the possibility of creating such a report and securing support for it,” Howard E. Gardner ’65, a professor of education at the Ed School, wrote in an email.
“The birthing process was lengthy,” Gardner added, writing that it “involved multiple iterations, feedback, and suggested changes, on the part of a score of persons.”
Gardner also said the efforts to publicize the report differed from what he called “the normal Harvard roll-out of research or policy.” Researchers publicly released the report at a press conference in New York, and in an opinion editorial by New York Times columnist Frank Bruni.
The report “sagely reflects on what’s wrong with admissions and rightly calls for a revolution,” Bruni wrote. “It could make a real difference not just because it has widespread backing but also because it nails the way in which society in general—and children in particular—are badly served by the status quo.”
Gardner said there is some evidence to justify that kind of optimistic outlook.
“Several campuses have already indicated that they are re-examining some of their practices and hoping that their applicants will focus more on quality of participation than on quantity, and on issues of caring and service, as well as grades and trophies,” he wrote. Still, he added that reforming admissions processes may require a prolonged time frame.
“It will take long, consistent efforts on the part of many players to achieve a different outcome—one which, I hope, will be a better and saner one.”
The report comes as Harvard’s own use of race in admissions practices has come under attack by a pending lawsuit that alleges the College discriminates against Asian American applicants.

Former University President Lawrence H. Summers decried a “creeping totalitarianism” on college campuses, calling out what he said is the growing preference for emotional comfort over academic inquiry in an interview with conservative political pundit William Kristol ’73.
Summers, who is a University Professor, discussed recent campus discourse and protests about race at colleges across the country during the 75-minute interview, criticizing “excesses” of political correctness on the part of students and administrators. In particular, he condemned controversial placemats that the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion introduced in Harvard dining halls last semester. Quickly denounced by a host of students and administrators as a breach from principles of academic freedom, the placemats purported to offer advice on holiday conversation with family members about race and inclusion.
“There is a great deal of absurd political correctness. Now, I’m somebody who believes very strongly in diversity, who resists racism in all of its many incarnations, who thinks that there is a great deal that’s unjust in American society that needs to be combated,” Summers said. “But it seems to be that there is a kind of creeping totalitarianism in terms of what kind of ideas are acceptable and are debatable on college campuses.”
Students at colleges across the country have in recent months protested for better treatment of minorities on their campuses. Last semester, Harvard saw a flurry of activism and protest from students across its schools. House masters at the College unanimously agreed in December to change their title, citing concerns about the racial implications of the term “Master.” And at the Law School, students have called for a series of changes, including removing the school’s seal, which they criticize for its ties to a slaveholding family.
At both Yale and Princeton, students have demanded  to change the name of some buildings and schools because of namesakes' historical origins and associations with slavery and alleged racism.
“I admire much more student protests about major moral issues like the Vietnam War, South African apartheid or global climate change, than protests coming from discomfort about the use of historical names,” Summers said in an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday.
With this campus backdrop, Summers said he was worried the primary mission of the university—to seek truth and foster debate—may be imperiled by a preference for comfort and harmony on college campuses.
“You have to recognize that social norms are, can be a good thing. And at the same time, shutting down debate can be a bad thing,” Summers told Kristol. For Summers, opposition to teaching rape law at Harvard Law School because of its sensitive nature is not consistent with free academic inquiry.
He chastised college administrators for not more boldly defending academic values.
“I think the weakness of — the weakness of administrators who have often had as their dominant instinct to placate rather than to educate has emboldened those who see their moment to establish a kind of orthodoxy,” Summers said. “I think it is the responsibility, and a responsibility that’s not being fully met, of academic leaders to address these issues,” he later added.
Kristol and Summers also discussed Summers’s tenure as the President of Harvard, including Summers’ efforts to reestablish a relationship between the University and the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adjunct faculty at Northeastern University reached a tentative settlement in their contract negotiations last Thursday, their first since deciding to unionize in April 2014.
While Peter R. Fraunholtz, an adjunct faculty member on the bargaining committee at Northeastern, said he believes the agreement will have an impact on other Boston-area universities—describing the agreement as a “pebble in the pond”—it is not clear what effect it will have on Harvard’s non-ladder faculty members. At Harvard, non-ladder faculty members are a diverse group of teachers and researchers, with different titles and roles across the University’s schools.
Alison D. Jones, a lecturer in Harvard’s Sociology department, said she is skeptical these recent developments will have any bearing on the status of Harvard’s non-ladder faculty—which currently is not represented by a union—even as the issue has gained increased attention. A group of graduate students began an effort to unionize last April. 
“I’m not too optimistic about things happening here, but there's more momentum than there has been in the past,” Jones said. “Part of the reason for that, as I understand, is that the graduate students have been making some strides and there is sort of a sense that there is kind of a momentum there that maybe adjuncts can take advantage of.”
Contract negotiations had been underway at Northeastern since September 2014. Reached just days before the adjunct faculty union threatened a walkout, the three-year contract includes increased pay, improved course stability, and greater involvement for adjunct faculty in campus decision-making.
“Our goal was to improve the pay for the adjunct professors that were getting paid the least, and we accomplished that,” Fraunholtz said. “They are going to get almost double over the next three years, and so we are very pleased with that outcome.”
Northeastern is among the first universities in Greater Boston—along with Tufts and Lesley—where adjunct faculty have collectively bargained with administrators.
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Director Bill Jaeger said that he “has not heard” of any unionization efforts by non-ladder faculty members at Harvard, who are not represented by HUCTW.
Jones said the lack of a concerted unionization effort could partly be due to generous compensation packages Harvard offers non-ladder faculty.
The majority of non-ladder faculty at Harvard, unlike at some peer institutions, receive benefits, even for teaching a single course on campus for a year, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith.
Harvard is also unique for the time limit it imposes on some non-ladder faculty members. Some non-ladder faculty cannot remain in the same position for more than three years, according to Jones. She said this time limit prevents a growing interest in unionization among faculty members.
“At Harvard, because of this limit, you aren’t around long enough in some of these cases to care enough,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opening whistle of the 2016 college football season may be nearly eight months away, but as of last week, the Harvard program has confirmed its schedule.
For the first time since the Ivy League was founded in 1956, the Crimson will play three consecutive road games, at Holy Cross, Princeton, and Dartmouth respectively. This mid-year gauntlet looms as a serious test for Harvard as it pushes for a fourth consecutive league title.
Other challenges menace in more typical places. As per usual, the Crimson will face off against Penn--the lone team to beat Harvard in 2015--and end the season against Yale.
The quest for a historic fourth championship will begin on September 16, when Harvard kicks off against Rhode Island at home. Last year, the Crimson beat the Rams 41-10 in the season opener.
This home game will be the first of three non-conference matchups, as Harvard will host Georgetown in week three and visit Holy Cross two weeks later.
Traditionally the Crimson has faced the Crusaders early in the season, but last year, for the first time since 1976, the two teams did not play. They will renew their non-conference rivalry in 2016.
Throughout the season, Harvard will match up against all seven Ivy League teams, starting in Providence against Brown in the second week of the season. The team will then play Cornell at home in week four.
In 2015, the Crimson handled both these opponents with ease, but the 2016 conference schedule toughens up as the year progresses. Harvard will close out the season with five straight Ancient Eight matchups, consecutively playing Princeton away, Dartmouth at home, Columbia at home, Penn away, and Yale at home.
Based on last season’s results, the Big Green and the Quakers stand out as the toughest tilts. Three months ago, the Crimson bested Dartmouth, 14-13, by scoring all 14 points in the fourth quarter. Then, against Penn, Harvard gave up an early lead en route to its only loss of the year.
The 2016 schedule culminates with the 133rd playing of The Game. Harvard has won nine in a row against the Bulldogs, including last season’s 38-19 thumping in New Haven. This year’s contest will take place in Cambridge, and the Crimson will look to extend the longest winning streak in the history of the Game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Hosting the top-ranked team in the country, the Harvard women’s hockey team could not pull off the upset Tuesday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
No. 1/1 Boston College (24-0, 16-0 ECAC) held off the Crimson, 2-0, (10-7-1, 5-7-1) and maintained its undefeated record.
The two teams had not faced off since the 2014-2015 postseason, during which Harvard edged out BC 2-1.
This time out on the ice, the Crimson offense could not muster up enough power for the victory. In a physical game in which each team had four penalties, tensions ran high between the benches. Senior forward Miye D’Oench had two whistles called on her, both for checking in the third period. Freshman defenseman Kaitlin Tse and junior defenseman Briana Mastel were both charged with checking as well.
Despite having four penalties called against the team and having to deal with a five-on-three situation in the second period, the home team was able to kill all four power plays.
“Our team came out really hard,” freshman defenseman Kate Hallett said. “When you play a team like BC it’s easy to have a lot of energy. Even though it was a loss overall it proved that we can play with them and can play with anyone on any given day.”
The Eagles’ first goal came late in the first period when senior forward Meghan Grieves snuck the puck past Harvard’s senior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer with the help of sophomores Tori Sullivan and Toni Ann Miano.
The Crimson’s offense could not find a response to BC’s tally on the scoreboard. The Eagles defense was also relentless, as BC picked up three of the next four penalties of the contest. Despite the time spent on the ice with a one-man advantage, Harvard could not push a puck to the back of BC’s net. The Crimson was able to muscle 29 shots on goal throughout the contest, though Eagle goalie Katie Burt maintained a perfect save record.
“I think for the most part in this game we just tried to get everything to the net,” junior forward Karly Heffernan said. “Maybe we could have held onto the puck a second longer and gotten a better shot off but for the most part we are just trying to get shots to the net and for some reason we’re not getting the proper plays.”
D’Oench, senior forward Michelle Picard, and sophomore forward Dani Kryszczyk each had four shots on goal, leading the Harvard offense for the night. Junior defenseman Abby Frazer and senior forward Sydney Daniels each had two. But it was BC senior forward Alex Carpenter that took home the title for most shots on goal for the night, tallying 10 of the Eagles’ 38 shots.
Injuries have forced the Crimson to restructure some of its’ lines, with Heffernan and Kryszczyk skating together on the same line for one of the first times this season. Despite the changes to the available skaters, Harvard has tried to make the best of the situation.
“We’re trying to get whole again,” head coach Katey Stone said. “It’s that next person up mentality. We’ve got kids in many different positions and we have had a lot of flux in our line positions but the kids are handling it as best they can but we haven’t yet been healthy since the beginning of the year.”
Grieves struck again in the second period for BC at the 18:26 mark. She again had help from Sullivan off the left wing of the ice. After that goal hit the back of the net, scoring for both teams went silent for the rest of the night.
This was Harvard’s third straight loss, having dropped its weekend series. The team has now gone five periods without a drive that resulted in a goal.
“In my opinion I think our compete level has been there these past three games,” Heffernan said. “[They had] a couple lucky bounces on their part and executed in their zone, but I think once we get that next goal things will start rolling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

When, on November 14, 2015, Harvard freshman middle blocker Jocelyn Meyer delivered the final kill to beat Brown in Providence, R.I., the crowd of 276 erupted in noise. For the second straight season, players and fans could celebrate something rare: a share of an Ivy League title.
Fifty-four miles away, in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard men’s volleyball team was staging a celebration of its own after following the game on the Ivy League Digital Network.
“As soon as they won, we made sure to text them and congratulate them,” said senior outside hitter Branden Clemens. “They actually came straight back from Brown, and then we hung out as one big program and celebrated their success.”
While the two teams have different seasons--the women play in the fall and the men in the spring–they also have a lot in common.
They share a gym, a lot of physical height, and an assistant coach in Jeff Aucoin, but they also share  a mutual love for each other that bonds the two programs even beyond their shared sport. This unique connection permeates classes and continues to grow as new athletes join the teams.
“We have a mutual respect that is initially started when we come in as freshmen because we see our upperclassmen bond with each other,” said Corie Bain, a junior setter for the women’s team. “It has just been a very easy way to have a group of guys that really [looks] out for you.”
Connections run deep between these two teams, with multiple relationships starting before players even don crimson. Bain and men’s junior outside hitter Casey White went to the same high school; women’s sophomore outside hitter Michaela Dews and men’s sophomore middle blocker/outside hitter Brad Gretsch played for the same Coast Volleyball Club in California.
But similar backgrounds aren’t the only reason for the close alliance. The teams have a strong tradition of shared experiences outside the court. The first social of the fall semester and the last social of the spring semester are always together.
“As we get new players each year, and [the women’s team] gets new players each year, we definitely try to make an effort to get to know them and be as friendly and welcoming as we can be,” Clemens said. “I think that it betters the student-athlete experience to have that support.”
This year, on the women’s senior night, an unprompted gentlemanly gesture revealed the depth of the two teams’ relationship.
The men’s team couldn’t make it to the women’s match, so to show their support they left roses and notes in front of the four seniors’ lockers expressing how proud they were and how much they valued their four years together as members of the Harvard volleyball program.
“[That] was kind of the epitome of our relationship to me,” women’s co-captain Caroline Holte said. “Just constant support for each other.”
The support truly is constant, as the teams have locker rooms in the Malkin Athletic Center that are right next to each other. Sometimes the two squads blast music through the shared walls, engaging in a friendly competition to drown out the other’s beats.
In addition, the separate seasons mean that the men are able to work the women’s home games and vice versa. Players will scoop up balls and manage the scorebook and the scoreboard.
The support both in the stands and around Harvard has melded these two teams into one cohesive, if still separate, family. As each team improves, so does the connection that brings the two athletic programs together off the court.
“I would definitely say that the [men’s volleyball team is] our brother team,” Holte said. “The constant interaction and constant support is something that I will genuinely cherish about the volleyball program as a whole. It doesn’t feel like two separate teams at all; it feels like one team.”
In the 2015 season, the women’s team achieved several program firsts, including a bid to the NCAA tournament and an unprecedented repeat Ivy title.
Beginning this January, the men will begin their quest to follow in the women’s footsteps  as they begin their play–with the reciprocal support of the women’s team behind them throughout the year.
“I still think back to the first time that we met them,” Clemens said. “It’s amazing to see how much we changed and also stayed true to ourselves during our college careers…. Hopefully some of their good luck and hard work can rub off on us, and we can have as successful a season as they did.”
