After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in his annual report that our vaunted library system will need to be reshaped with “a dramatically smaller base of resources.” While times are tough, the administration should be extremely reluctant to slash funds for this cornerstone of the university. During this period of budget contraction, cuts have necessarily been extended to many parts of the school, yet libraries are one of the sacrosanct areas of this institution that deserve preservation in particular.
Harvard’s library system is one of its greatest treasures, constituting the largest academic library in the word, with over 16.8 million holdings. This enormous system has been maintained on the cheap for the past decade with a budget that has stayed generally stagnant while the rest of the university’s expenditures have ballooned. According to English Department chair James T. Engell ’73, the staff increases in FAS over the last six years have been roughly equivalent to the size of the entire Harvard College Library staff. The director of the Harvard University Library system, Robert C. Darnton ’60, even said that the libraries are “being bled to death.” Acquisition rates have fallen precipitously as the prices of published material and periodicals have rapidly increased, and the Harvard College Library lost 100 staff positions this past summer.
A library system of this magnitude contains texts that might not exist elsewhere, preserving a unique part of the world’s accumulated knowledge. A system of such importance should be one of the last to face drastic budget cuts, especially considering its already dire financial condition.
While library funding should be preserved, the library system should look for efficiencies that can improve quality and save money wherever possible. As the task force led by University Provost Steven E. Hyman has noted, the current decentralized system forces Harvard libraries to bid against each other to acquire the same books. An effort to better coordinate services would hopefully result in savings without the loss of one of Harvard’s most important resources.
This university acquired its name in 1638 as a result of a bequest of 400 books from John Harvard. The spread and preservation of the written word has been essential to its mission ever since, and we must not allow tough economic times to damage this legacy.

The Ukrainian government’s policies on swine flu make quarantines and Purell dispensers look like amateur efforts. Due to rising fears about a possible swine flu epidemic, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliya V. Tymoshenko announced a nationwide ban on public gatherings, the closing of all schools for three weeks, and various travel restrictions. The strict measures come at a critical time in the Ukrainian presidential campaign, with Tymoshenko closely trailed by opposition leader Victor Yanukovich in the polls. Although we realize that the spread of H1N1 is a serious health issue, these measures seem extreme and dubious given the election climate. Ukraine’s swine flu policy needs to be better justified or called off.
We realize that H1N1 is a serious health problem for many countries. H1N1 is a new virus whose timing, duration, and severity are still uncertain. Moreover, the treatment of this disease is difficult, especially in countries like Ukraine whose medical infrastructure does not equal that of other Western countries. The severity of the disease in Ukraine, however, does not seem to merit the drastic steps the government has taken. Although national health officials have cited 33 flu deaths in support of the measure, they have not definitively specified how many of these deaths were a result of swine flu and how many were a result of other viruses. Additionally, to put this count in perspective, the Centers for Disease Control reported 292 swine flu deaths in the U.S. from just August 30 to October 10, 2009. Ukraine’s anti-swine flu measures are also markedly more extreme than those of neighboring Russia and Poland.
Furthermore, the H1N1 virus should not become politicized. The government should prioritize health in its response, not politics. In Ukraine, combating swine flu seems to have turned into a contest among politicians to see who can be most aggressive when addressing public-health issues. However, the most extreme political response is not always the best one, and the ability to calibrate a measured response is as valuable as the ability to execute a far-reaching one. Public health is not a political game, and Ukraine’s leaders must realize that the cost of an overblown response is more material than a few points at the polls.
Regardless of the intentions behind these measures, though, we have further concerns that these steps may become undemocratic, especially given the ban on public gatherings during an election season. In losing the ability to gather in large groups, supporters of Yanukovich have lost their best avenue to advocate for their candidate. The free and easy public discourse that is vital to a democratic election in this instance seems clearly impaired. Ukraine’s troubling recent history with elections makes it especially vital that this campaign proceed as fairly and smoothly as possible. Otherwise, the same election uncertainties that engendered the “Orange Revolution” four years ago may this time around cause a “Swine Flu Revolution.”

On Wednesday, October 28, America once again showcased its dominance in space technology to the world, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration successfully launched its Ares 1-X Rocket from the Kennedy Space Center. Such an achievement augurs well: The new moon program is a shining rebuttal to detractors of America’s math and science programs as well as a promise for progress in American space exploration in the future.
To begin with, the rocket’s technical specifications are astounding. Thirty-two stories high, the Ares 1-X towers as the tallest rocket in the world. And the sight of the launch was no less spectacular than the rocket itself. The first stage of the engine brought the rocket 25 miles into the air until its fuel ran out and parachuted it into the ocean.
But the true triumph of the Ares rocket doesn’t lie in its physical properties alone. It’s the less tangible inspiration the rocket will provide to future generations of American mathematicians, scientists, and engineers that makes it so important. Education reformers working with students from kindergarten through 12th grade will now be able to look to the rocket as a symbol of hope and inspiration. The Ares will encourage them to imagine even more fantastic goals and products that will be achieved after America repairs its education problem.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann ’71 explained that “the Sputnik era didn’t come because a lot of idealists said we had to be better. It came because there were idealists as there are today who said we’re in trouble as a country, we have to compete against the Russians. We have to compete today against the Chinese and Indians who are graduating tens of thousands more very talented science, math, and engineering graduates from their colleges.” The success of the new moon program can now be used by policymakers in arguing for both increasing the number of graduates in the math and sciences as well as improving the quality of those programs.
Gutmann’s words recall the more famous speech by President John F. Kennedy ’40, who argued before Congress at the start of his own moon program that “This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself.” As we are currently slated to begin a moon colony in 2020, NASA is making laudable progress in creating the infrastructure needed for it. After the moon colony is established, it will only be a matter of time until a Mars colony becomes feasible.
And our nation’s engineers will get us there. The time, energy, resources, and knowledge expended on the moon program will inevitably have significant payoffs in the math and science sectors of America. The Ares rocket represents a remarkable American engineering marvel, the first of what look like many to come in the 21st century.

Our school plays porn to students. To my knowledge, it’s pseudo-porn and only in “English 154: Literature and Sexuality” during shopping period, but it’s alluring enough to induce 481 Harvard undergraduates into enrolling in the class, despite liberals, conservatives, and faculty alike decrying sexual objectification. Our school delights in humanism—reason! Intellect! Achievement! But when it comes to sex, the pursuit of physical pleasure—as long as you’ve got a condom—transcends reason. Self-control is prudish, unenlightened restraint—down with the patriarchy! Away with gender roles! My body is my play toy.
We have descended into a paradox. Sex gives us meaning—but is a meaningless end in itself. Our very identities are sexualized. As illustrated by “Harvard FML,” our newest and most embarrassing confessional outlet, hookups are messy, and college romance is messier. One cyber-girl moans, “All the guys I like always stop talking to me after we hook up. I feel like a classic ‘wham bam, thank you ma’am.’” If we are perplexed with organic chemistry and philosophy, then we are bewildered by sex, lust, love, and the specter of marriage.
We wildly seek answers. By trial, by error, by reading, by debating, by daydreaming, by flirting, by midnight talks lounging on roommate’s beds, by dining -hall conversations leaving us wondering where all the good men or women have gone: Is there truth? Will it set us free?
It is in this whirlwind that True Love Revolution connects the fragments of our culture. The nature of the 21st-century academic relegates us to later marriages. We are destined to fall in and out of love—or something—again and again before we seal the deal. This open time window encourages sexual activity—with or without commitment. “Gossip Girl” features high-school students losing both their virginity and dignity, Cosmopolitan flouts sex tips, movies mock men who wait for marriage, and intellectuals call casual sex empowering. It’s difficult to describe the plot of a contemporary TV show without relating who slept with whom. If cultures speak, then our culture screams: “It’s normal, OK?”
But if casual sex is normal, why do culture and academia need to remind us? Better yet, why do some radical feminists save their virginity? Why do at least 42 percent of Harvard students not have sex? Some declare that we just can’t get any sex, but if a larger percentage of the student body wanted the hookup culture, odds would be pretty good that more students could find it.
Without declaring war, True Love Revolution draws a conclusion. Culture reduces us to the sexual, but being human promises so much more. The sexualization of people and relationships hinders our development as human beings. When we embrace the sexual culture that stretches its logic to render us servile, we find ourselves unfulfilled. Abstinence resists cultural messages about human worth. Unlike casual sex, abstinence is empowering because, instead of making sex and uncontrolled lust an end, it makes people the end.
English 154 grapples with this same idea. “Sexuality” has gradually displaced “soul,” “mind,” and “character” as the most essential and salient ingredient in modern subjectivity, as the “truth of the self,” reads the course description. Temporary physical pleasure now outwits the soul, reason, and virtue. Gone are the days when we place value on condemning its consequences, though many conspicuously refuse to participate.
The vast majority of college students seek marriage one day, but our perspectives on relationships do not always reflect this. It is as if commitment is a character trait developed instantly at the altar—once the ring is on the finger. But those of us addicted to endorphins, prone to procrastination, or disposed to overspending recognize that traits cannot apparate; they must be habituated. By trial and error, society found that cohabitation and increased number of sexual partners lead to higher divorce rates.
In this commitment-less environment, social connections wither away, as evidenced in Professor Robert Putnam’s sobering book, “Bowling Alone.” On our fast-paced campus, a dating-culture return may be distant, but a return to commitment habituated through abstinence to a future partner will both galvanize the dating scene and make people more deeply known—a longing so prevalent it is heartbreaking.
We are lackluster students—we believe what we learn. We willingly objectify ourselves, and our best foot forward is our sexuality, not our soul. When we embrace the sexualized college student role, we surrender our identities: The vibrant, beautiful, curious, winsome, self-controlled men and women that we are. Will we be slaves to sexuality, or seek out something more?

On Halloween, if you donned a headdress and dubbed yourself Squanto, you may have committed racism.
I would give you the benefit of the doubt, but Native Americans at Harvard College might be less indulgent. Last Friday, the club sent students an e-mail entitled, “We Are Not a Costume.” The message urged readers to avoid “culturally insensitive costumes” like “the quintessential Pocahontas or Indian Squaw or the hypersexualized Geisha.” Such outfits, the group warned, “reinforce centuries of cultural stereotypes and racism.”
But costumes by definition are exaggerations, and this accusation of racism is overblown.
Not everything in the e-mail was objectionable. November is Native American Heritage Month, and the group wanted to spread awareness of this fact. The message highlighted Native Americans’ contributions to our culture, of which some people may be unaware. For instance, a Nipmuc printed the first Bible in North America. And the Founders studied the Iroquois Confederacy when designing our government. Part of the club’s mission is to “to educate the Harvard campus about Native issues and address popular misconceptions of Natives.” In this pursuit, the group has a worthy goal.
Unfortunately, the charges of racism overshadowed this effort. Even worse, the blunt e-mail wrote its own parody. When reacting to the message, some students mimicked its harsh tone. On the Voice’s blog, Noice, a writer satirized the e-mail in a post, “Hey You! Yeah, You. Your Costume is Straight Up Racist.” She summarized the group’s comparison of these costumes to African American stereotypes: “It’s like wearing black face, you ass.” Meanwhile, a student on Pfopen, Pforzheimer House’s e-mail list, sarcastically responded: “…all costumes are not stereotypes. All nurses are slutty looking and all teachers wear short skirts.”
On the other hand, Thomas S. Miller ’11, the club’s president, told me that the feedback he received was “almost entirely positive.” “I’ve gotten a ton of e-mails from students who want to learn more about Native culture,” he said. In this sense, the message was successful. “If it had not been controversial, it wouldn’t have gotten all this attention,” Miller observed. But this e-mail is only the group’s second so far this year. Maybe those students just didn’t know the club existed.
Still, the group finds these costumes disrespectful. They are, after all, exaggerations of Native Americans’ attire. “It’s kind of a stepping stone,” Miller argued. “It leads to thinking about people in a certain way.” This argument is plausible but not airtight. Puritan costumes are exaggerations—few Pilgrims wore belt buckles on their hats—yet we don’t consider them invidious. Besides, Halloween is frivolous, and most people understand it that way. They may dress like gangsters, but they know that most Italians are law-abiding. They may wield sewer caps, but they know that most Ninja Turtles are well groomed.
Then again, these costumes mock Native Americans’ traditional garb. “People don’t recognize what they’re wearing is sacred; we’re trying to raise awareness,” Miller said. But even if people recognize what they are wearing, does their awareness make a difference? Catholic priests and nuns are popular costumes, yet the beadles at St.   Paul’s Church do not demand apologies. These costumes are poking fun at religious vestments, but in a good-humored way. To live in a diverse society, groups have to take harmless spoofs of their culture in stride.
More importantly, if people too often accuse others of racism, the charge will lose its currency. NAHC is right to oppose stereotypes of Native Americans, but these costumes are not the best targets. If students remember them as the club that cried “racist” over costumes, they may be less inclined to listen when the group identifies truly virulent racism in our midst.
Outrage over stereotypes needs the proper outlet. Racism is a damaging force, both blatantly and subtly, but sometimes it isn’t subtle—it’s non-existent. The NAHC should continue to spotlight misconceptions about its culture and educate people about its heritage. But it should leave the would-be Pocahontas alone. She’s not racist; she’s just unoriginal.
That said, Native Americans will not have to worry about me for future Halloweens. I won’t be sporting moccasins or carrying tomahawks. They’re not my style. For me, the “tortured writer” look comes much more easily.

Harvard inked a deal yesterday to purchase 10 percent of annual electricity consumed on its Cambridge and Allston campuses from a leading wind provider in New England.
This agreement, in which Harvard will acquire over 30 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, slates the University to become the largest institutional buyer of wind power in the region, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I applaud the energy team for funding a verifiable renewable energy project,” said Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the Harvard Office of Sustainability. “The scale [of the purchase] can teach us about wind technology, because we’re also about being a living laboratory, learning so we can encourage others.”
The renewable energy purchase, orchestrated by the University Operations Services (UOS), makes Harvard a leader in green power consumption, catapulting it from the twelfth to the fourth largest green power consumer of US Colleges and Universities, according to an October 2009 EPA report.
“[This deal] is part of our broader efforts to be sustainable where we can and wherever possible to use renewable products to reduce our environmental impact,” said Mary H. Smith, an energy strategist at UOS. “We look at this as a long-term pricing strategy that is very competitive with other prices.”
Under the long-term contract with First Wind, a Massachusetts-based developer of wind power headquartered in Boston, Harvard will purchase 50 percent of the energy produced from First Wind’s soon-to-be constructed wind farm in northern Maine for the next 15 years.
“Harvard is a New England leader when it comes to many things, and they’re taking a good step forward in terms of backing renewable powers, and putting their money where their mouth is,” said John R. Lamontagne, a spokesman for First Wind. “It’s good deal for them, [a] good deal for us, and we’re very excited to be working with them.”
The Stetson II wind plant currently under development will produce enough wind energy annually to power 10,000 homes by as early as July 4, 2010, said Lamontagne.
The deal is part of Harvard’s larger efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 percent below 2006 levels by 2016. Harvard has scaled up its waste reduction, recycling efforts, and on-site clean energy projects in order to keep to this commitment.
This September, Harvard Real Estate Services installed a pair of 40-foot wind turbines on the Soldier’s Field Parking Garage that will provide 10 percent of the garage’s annual energy needs.
The University has also undertaken the installation of the largest institutional solar array, a 500 kWh panel atop a University-owned building in Watertown that will generate over 7 percent of the complex’s annual energy.

From mofongo con camarones (mashed plantains with shrimp) to asado argentino (Argentinian steak), Harvard Square diners will have their choice of eclectic Latin American cuisine tomorrow night with the opening of Congas Bar and Restaurant.
Located on the corner of Eliot and Winthrop Streets, this latest addition to the Square’s lineup of dining-out options will occupy the space that was previously home to Shabu Square, a hotpot restaurant that closed its doors this past June.
Infusing a culinary foundation of Spanish tapas with South American and Caribbean flavors, Congas will feature not only a novel menu but also a unique atmosphere and mood for the Square, said restaurant partner Mauricio Rocha.
“We want to create a world where you can just relax and listen to music by Celia Cruz, the queen of salsa, and hear songs like ‘Gypsy Queen’ [of Gábor Szabó],” Rocha said.
Panja S. Lymswam, Congas’ owner, reiterated their intended emphasis on good music and creating a “night-club like” ambiance at Congas.
Lymswam, who also owned Congas’ predecessor, Shabu Square, said that he decided to make the switch from hotpots to tapas after recognizing a relative lack of Spanish and Latin American food options among Harvard Square eateries. He formally requested to make the change to the License Commission in August.
Lymswam also owns Spice Thai on Holyoke Street and 9 Tastes Fine Thai on JFK Street.
“I think the opening of Congas and having another choice is really wonderful for the consumer,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “It makes Harvard Square that much more appealing.”
According to Jillson, the idea behind Shabu Square, where food is cooked at customers’ tables in hotpots, “was new and interesting.” But the restaurant may have ultimately failed because of the competition it faced from another Shabu eatery in Cambridge—Shabu-Ya, which is located on JFK Street.
Congas itself might not be immune from culinary competition, Jillson added.
Though she said she did not believe a direct rival to Congas would open anytime soon, she noted the possibility of competition from the only currently existing tapas bar in the Square—Small Plates, which is also located on JFK Street.

For 27 years, the Honduran national soccer team played under the shadows of past glory, suffering heartbreaking defeats that have weighed on the nation’s psyche.
But on Oct. 14, a last minute flick of a head on the final day of World Cup qualifiers erased those nearly three decades of anguish—and triggered euphoria across a nation embroiled in political and economic distress.
Rodolfo F. Pastor, a visiting professor of history at Harvard, understands how the identity and culture of Honduras—a nation obsessed with soccer—has evolved alongside the country’s political and economic misfortunes. Until recently, Pastor served as the Honduran Minister of Culture under President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Pastor was forced to flee the country this past summer when a military coup ousted Zelaya’s administration.
“Sports have been always been a gateway of building identity, a collective identity,” Pastor says. “Hondurans have a very grievous problem derived from socioeconomic and political circumstances. It is a problem with their self-esteem; with the idea of who they are and what it means to be Honduran.”
Pastor says he believes that the recent success of the Honduran soccer team has helped to unify the nation and temporarily mitigate underlying social tensions. But he also worries that politicians may exploit and manipulate the team for their own ends.
“In all different and important positions, left and right, people will try to manipulate the image of this triumph and use it for their own very perverse purposes,” Pastor says. “You can see it in the way people project to take the ‘selecionados,’ the heroes of the story, into their photo op[s].”
He also expressed fears that the soccer team’s success will be used to obscure more pressing concerns in Honduras, such as the widespread poverty that persists in much of the nation.
“A country should not be built on the idea that we can produce athletes,” Pastor says. “We have to build a country where we have opportunities for people to stay [in the country], be productive, and lead happy lives.”
‘INFERIORITY COMPLEX’
For decades, Honduras has been marred by systemic economic underachievement and unexpected natural calamities. These issues have contributed to the development of what Pastor calls a national “inferiority complex”—a problem that he says has been reflected in the national team’s struggle to qualify for the World Cup.
In 2005, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) estimated that 22 percent of the Honduran population lived in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.25 a day. The World Bank, which ranked Honduras as the third poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, estimated in 2007 that over 59 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
These economic concerns have been exacerbated by natural disasters, including the category five Hurricane Mitch that devastated the Caribbean Sea in 1998. The United States Geological Survey said the hurricane caused upwards of $3 billion in damages and over 7,000 casualties, destroyed large portions of the nation’s transportation infrastructure, and wiped out 70 percent of the nation’s crops.
“The basic problem [of Honduras’ national inferiority complex] is rooted in the fact that so many people do not have opportunities to develop themselves or their skills and virtues for a particular vocation,” Pastor says. “They do not receive the education, the nutrition, the basic health care that one needs to develop as a person.”
‘FÚTBOL NATION’
For a nation of seven million conditioned to distress, soccer has often served as the only means to escape the severities of reality.
Jaime Villegas, captain of the 1982 Honduran soccer team that qualified for the World Cup, says he saw firsthand how his exploits on the field became a panacea for the country.
“Many kids at that time, especially those who liked football, looked on us as role models and continued their passion [in the sport],” said Villegas in a telephone interview conducted in Spanish with The Crimson. Villegas currently serves as the sporting director of a first division Honduran soccer club.
“[Honduras] is a ‘fútbol nation’...Political rivalries are forgotten, if only temporarily, and rivals will embrace when the national team does well,” he adds.
In 1981, Honduras, a minnow in international soccer, went undefeated in its home qualifying matches and eliminated Mexico—one of the dominant forces in the region—en route to securing its first-ever entry into the FIFA World Cup. On the sport’s grandest stage, Honduras tied Spain, the host of the tournament, helping to establish Honduras’ soccer credentials on an international level and sparking speculation that a new era of athletic success was in the offing.
But in the nearly three decades since, those expectations have been unfulfilled. In the summer of 2001, Honduras was invited at the last minute to participate in the Copa America, South America’s premier tournament. Arriving just a few hours before their first game, the team went on to upset defending champion Brazil.
Yet despite the hopes garnered from that tournament, Honduras went on to suffer a heartbreaking defeat later that winter, capitulating in its last World Cup qualifying game to last-placed Trinidad and Tobago.
Now, eight years later, Honduras has overcome that spectre of defeat.
TRIUMPH AT LAST
This past June, Honduran President Zelaya was arrested at his home by military officials and exiled from the country, sparking months of civil unrest.
Two weeks after Zelaya’s arrest, the Honduran national team defeated Costa Rica 4-0 in a qualifying match for the World Cup, seemingly positioning the nation for its second-ever appearance in the World Cup finals.
But by September, Honduras’ World Cup campaign had taken a turn for the worse. In the penultimate qualifying match, Honduras lost to the United States 3-2.
With political chaos at home serving as a backdrop for Honduras’ final qualifying match, it seemed that the nation’s history of soccer misfortune would repeat itself yet again.
In the final day of qualifiers, Honduras played against El Salvador and needed the United States to tie or defeat Costa Rica in order to advance to the World Cup. Honduras won its match 1-0, with 36-year-old Carlos Pavón providing the lone goal, but the United States quickly fell behind in its game.
Yet down one goal in stoppage time, the United States struck a last second header into the back of the net to tie Costa Rica, sending Honduras to its second World Cup finals appearance—and relieving the team of 27 years of burdensome expectations.
‘NEW HEROES’
Pavón, the qualifying region’s top scorer, served as a fulcrum for the nation’s renewed sense of unity. Pavón is of Garifuna descent, an ethnic mix of Carib, Arawak, and West African peoples that has been marginalized and discriminated against in Honduran society.
Pastor says Pavón’s ascension as a nationally iconic figure has highlighted soccer’s unique ability to transcend societal barriers in Honduras. He says he believes Pavón’s achievements show that “anyone from any social class, with minimal conditions and the right kind of effort, can achieve excellence in any field.”
“To see [Pavón] lead the team to victory and [for the country] to identify him as Honduran has served the positive function of getting the rest of Honduras to recognize the valuable aspect that is our Garifuna community,” Pastor says.
The national team itself also represents a diverse mix of players from cities around Honduras. The current pool of talent, Pastor says, is “a symbol of how the country has come together.”
Villegas, the 1982 team captain, said he believes this current generation of players rivals his own era in terms of talent.
“There are now new heroes in Honduras,” Villegas says. “In ’82 it was us, and now kids are looking to players like Pavón, [Wilson] Palacios, and [Amado] Guevara as role models.”
Guevara, captain of the current Honduran team, is one of the highest-paid players in United States Major League Soccer. Villegas said that he believes the Honduran team will continue to perform well internationally and that many players from the team will be selected to play in European soccer clubs after the World Cup.
Yet Pastor also warns that sporting success should not be the only measure of Honduran progress, and he notes that the international community will only respect the nation when it is able to surmount its broader difficulties.

Though five students have been nominated to run for Phillips Brooks House Association President in tomorrow night’s elections, it appears probable that current PBHA programming co-chair Katilin S. L. Koga ’11 will run unopposed for the position.
Of the current nominees, only Koga has confirmed her intentions to seek the presidency to The Crimson and has submitted a “position paper,” a document in which a candidate outlines his or her vision for PBHA.
If elected, Koga said she hopes to focus on improving the sense of unity across PBHA’s 85 programs.
“PBHA is a really divided organization in a lot of ways, just because people serve so many different communities and provide so many different services,” Koga said. “Having more people in dialogue with one another is a big vision of mine.”
The other four nominees—Karla A. Reyes ’11, Christopher J. Loney ’11, Abigail S. Brown ’11, and Terry T. Ding ’11—all confirmed to The Crimson early this week that they would not be seeking the presidency.
PBHA elections are difficult to predict with certainty, however, because further nominations can be accepted from the floor on the night of the elections.
Current PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10 said it is “relatively uncommon” to see students interested in high-level executive positions fail to announce their intentions and submit a position paper ahead of the election.
“At least in my three years, I haven’t seen anyone run for President who hasn’t put a position paper up earlier,” Kelley said.
This year’s elections will include a number of significant changes in voting procedure, following last year’s heavily contested vote, in which Kelley was named President only after a recount of the ballots.
Current PBHA Summer Program Group Officer Jessica G. Ranucci ’10, who was involved in the reform process, said the changes would both update election procedures and make them more resistant to bias by including stricter conflict-of-interest laws.
One of the major reforms will be a switch to instant-runoff voting, the method currently utilized by the Undergraduate Council, which involves ranking candidates in order of preference.
This will replace the old system that held runoff elections until one candidate captured a majority of the votes.
“We did everything we could to try to make it fair and impartial,” Ranucci said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students may be surprised to hear that their school, one of the best universities in the world, is averaging a cumulative GPA of 2.68.
The University was given the poor mark for its overall “sexual health” last week in the fourth-annual Trojan Sexual Health Report Card, which ranked Harvard number 62 out of 141 American colleges and universities—a drastic decline from the University’s 25th-place ranking last year or its top 10 showing the year before.
The report—based on the premise that more information about sexual health will allow students to make better informed decisions about sex—does not reflect sexual activity or STD prevalence, but rather focuses on the resources available to students about sexual health.
But exactly what caused the precipitous drop remains unclear, and Sarah Rankin, director of the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR), said she was at a loss to explain Harvard’s slide in the ranking.
“Nothing has changed over my four years here that I am aware of on campus, but our grades have been all over the place. I don’t know what information they base it on because no one has been contacted from my office,” Rankin said.
“If anything, we are more visible, which does not compute with the fact our score has gone down,” she added, noting that personnel are on call 24 hours a day for sexual assault during the academic year and that peer education programming is available.
Madeleine E. Ballard ’11, who is involved in student health issues on campus, said she couldn’t explain Harvard’s slip in the report, either.
“I think Harvard does a pretty good job at informing students about sexual health,” Ballard said. “A number of good resources are available like peer health counselors [and] obviously [University Health Services].”
Bert T. Sperling, the president of Sperling’s BestPlaces—the research firm Trojan contracted to conduct the survey—said the survey’s results were not “earth-shattering.”
“After doing this for four years, I am not surprised with the findings,” he added.
Trojan commissioned the survey—which collected data in 13 categories, ranging from student opinion about the campus health center to condom and contraceptive cost—“to initiate dialogue and provide a benchmark for student health center across the country,” according to Sperling.
Since the first Trojan Sexual Health Report Card was issued in 2006, Harvard’s performance has been wildly inconsistent. In 2007 it ranked as the 10th most sexually healthy school, while in 2006 it earned the 43rd spot.
Excluding Harvard, other Ivy League schools ranked as some of the most sexually healthy colleges and universities in this year’s report card. Brown, Cornell, and Columbia Universities placed in the top 10, and Yale ranked 15th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
With Forbes Magazine cutting a fourth of its staff, the New York Times laying off 100 workers, and Time Magazine letting go of 500, the future of news seems anything but certain—an assessment not entirely dispelled by a panel on journalism held last night at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The speakers at the forum, titled The Future of News, agreed that in order for newspapers to survive the economic downturn, there will be an inevitable shift from printed news to more online mediums.
Alex S. Jones, a Pulitzer Prize winner and director of the Shorenstein Center, said it was important to maintain an “institution”—whether printed or online—as a credible source for up-to-date information on local and world happenings.
“These institutions are important, and if they disappear, are going to create a terrible vacuum in communities,” Jones said.
Due to the economic crisis, online news sites have become a cheaper alternative to printed papers for many newspapers who wish to continue operating.
While the panelists agreed that the focus on online news is not a negative shift, they stressed that the quality of journalism needs to stay the same.
According to Jeff Howe, a current Nieman fellow and contributing editor of Wired magazine, the increase in online news has also led to an increase in amateur journalism or “crowdsourcing” through mediums such as online blogs and Twitters. Howe said that these forms of news should not replace professional journalism.
Martin Baron, the editor of The Boston Globe, echoed Howe’s point.
“Journalism is sending professionals out to find out what is going on, [who] verifies documents, is fair and honest, and broadcasts it in a forum that is accessible. This does not happen with user generated news,” Baron said.
Despite the loss of jobs in the media industry, Jones said he believes the down turn is a good thing.
“Newspapers have become more efficient,” Jones said. “There are opportunities to keep these institutions alive, and hopefully it happens.”
Christopher J. Hollyday ’11, the organizer of the forum and chairman of the forum committee on the Student Advisory Committee of the Institute of Politics, said the event was a valuable jumping-off point for future discussion.
“The news needs to come from important news sources, and recently we are seeing a shift to online, from sources that may not be credible,” said Hollyday, who is also a Crimson editorial editor.
Student attendees said that the forum provided a fresh perspective on the future of news.
“It was very interesting to hear the opinions of the important people in the field, and their optimism for the printed news in this tough economic time,” said David M. Hafferty ’13.
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 3 news article "Journalists Discuss Future of Media" ran an incorrect quote from Boston Globe Editor Marty Baron, which referred to journalists as 'semi-professionals.' In fact, Baron said that "Journalism is sending professionals out to find out what is going on, [who] verifies documents, is fair and honest, and broadcasts it in a forum that is accessible."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The executive director of a prominent environmental action group and two Harvard professors debated the best path to passage for pending environmental legislation at a panel discussion in the Science Center yesterday.
“We need a lot of solutions, we need them at scale, and we need them fast,” said National Resources Defense Council Executive Director Peter H. Lehner ’80 at the outset of his lecture, which was hosted in the Science Center by the Harvard University Center for the Environment. “We are literally off the charts, in unknown territory.”
Citing data on the acidification of oceans, migrating climates in the United States, and skyrocketing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Lehner said environmental lobbying groups, as well as universities such as Harvard, must use their institutional clout to get the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES) passed by the U.S. Senate.
The legislation, which would use a cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse emissions by 17 percent by 2020, was approved by the House of Representatives in June.
Lehner said lobbying efforts could be successful by focusing on consumers, competitiveness, corn, coal, and nuclear power—as well as prioritizing bipartisanship.
But Harvard Center for the Environment Director Daniel P. Schrag and Environmental Epidemiology Professor Joel Schwartz challenged Lehner to explain the repercussions of these strategies.
Schwartz asked what would happen when the five areas of focus Lehner mentioned began to compete, while Schrag questioned whether the alternative fuel strategies Lehner proposed would be as cost efficient as he suggested.
Though the panelists never resolved these discrepancies, Environmental Action Committee Events Chair Tim L.C. Treuer ’10 said he found the discussion valuable.
“Hearing the panelists push Lehner’s optimistic analysis was interesting because they all have different perspectives, even though they want the same things to be done,” he said.
Lehner also warned attendees against believing there is such a thing as a “safe” level of carbon dioxide, even though the United Nations talks in Copenhagen this fall emphasized the limiting level of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide.
He offered three approaches to countering the climate problem: capping and putting a price on carbon, boosting clear energy, and encouraging efficiency. He said that last year, the average Californian used 40 percent less energy than the average American.
“And they’re still living comfortable lives over there,” he told the packed Science Center Hall.

A lecture by a corporate structure specialist at Harvard Law School yesterday featured free burritos and some unconventional thought on the civic responsibilities of corporations.
“My purpose is to bring a fresh perspective to law students, to put in front of them a vision of corporations and corporate law that perhaps they hadn’t had before,” said Allen White, who serves as vice president of the Tellus Institute, a research and policy organization focusing on sustainable development.
During the lecture, White said that corporate boards are often not held accountable for the consequences of their work, specifically in regards to sustainability. He linked the way corporations are run, which directly affects their carbon footprints, with the issue.
“Every company should publish an annual sustainability report according to an accepted framework,” he said. “We need to hold boards responsible [for] sustainability. This is given lip service a lot.”
White’s speech was part of a series of lectures organized by the Harvard Association of Law and Business. According to Michael R. Rozensher, a second-year student at HLS who organized the event, the goal of the series is to spread awareness of corporate responsibility.
White was selected to speak because of his three decade-long background advising both non-governmental organizations and corporations, Rozensher added.
“A lot of what I’m saying is out of the mainstream which I recognize,” White said. “That’s one of my goals—to be a little bit out of the mainstream and to challenge assumptions and conventional wisdom underlying the purpose of corporations and the legal standing of corporations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As November brings low temperature and swirling winds to the Charles River, the average person might be hesitant to get on the water. But the Harvard sailing team is more than happy to stay on the river for another two weeks.
Forced to overcome biting, difficult conditions this past weekend at three regattas, the Crimson stepped up in its biggest races, notching a fourth-place team finish at the Erwin Schell Trophy to qualify the co-ed squad for the Atlantic Coast Championships at home on Nov. 14.
“We were very pleased,” junior skipper Teddy Himler said. “The top seven teams qualify [for ACC’s]. Just to qualify is quite an accomplishment, but to get above that was even more satisfying.”
The women’s and rookie boats also posted strong showings for Harvard in less-than-ideal conditions, taking fourth place at the Victorian Coffee Urn and ninth in the Nickerson Trophy freshman regatta, respectively. With the fourth-place finish, the women also qualified for the Women’s Atlantic Coast Championship at Brown in two weeks.
Rather than complain about the driving wind that hampered all squads, Himler saw the weekend as preparation for the challenges ahead.
“Throughout the weekend we really progressed as a team, and individual sailors also honed their skills,” the skipper said. “We expect to do well at ACCs, especially because the conditions will be similar to what they were this weekend.”
ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
The Crimson struggled early at the 68th Erwin Schell Trophy, but Himler and fellow junior skipper Alan Palmer righted the ship, helping the squad to solid performances across the board. In the A division, Palmer led his boat to a fifth-place showing, pairing primarily with senior Winston Yan on Saturday before junior Grace Charles took over as crew on Sunday. The second duo notched four top-five finishes to lower the boat score to 148 points.
Himler shouldered the bulk of the skipper duties in the B division, pairing with crews senior Michelle Konstadt and sophomore Annie DeAngelo en route to a fourth-place finish. After finishing last in the second race of the competition, Himler and Konstadt adjusted to the conditions, rattling off three straight victories in the fourth through sixth races.
“The first day was wild,” Himler said. “It was 20 knots (25 mph winds), and it was a bit cold and wet. People weren’t used to those conditions, but we handled them extremely well.”
Indeed, the B boat finished no worse than ninth in the 20-team field for the rest of the day. Although DeAngelo and Himler did not fare as well on Sunday, the team’s solid effort kept the score at 144 and propelled Harvard to a crucial top-seven finish.
Yale had perhaps the most impressive showing at the regatta, edging Roger Williams for the team’s first Erwin Schell trophy since 1976.
VICTORIAN COFFEE URN
The Crimson women also braved difficulties to earn fourth over the weekend. The B boat—skippered by sophomore Emily Lambert and crewed by classmate Alexandra Jumper—shined for Harvard, suffering only one poor race over eight attempts. The boat failed to finish in its second contest, but went on to post sixth or better among the 16-team field in all other races—good enough for 40 points and third overall.
“We got a pretty extreme range of conditions this weekend on the river,” Jumper said. “Our first race was a first-place finish, and then our second race  we capsized and couldn’t finish...If we finished the race, we did pretty [well]. We were able to hold our own, and it was good practice in that breeze.”
The A-division pair of captain Liz Powers and sophomore Marie Appel, moving up to the top bracket for the first time this fall, struggled a bit more, but found a rhythm to close out the regatta. The boat finished seventh overall with 59 points, but earned a spot in the top six through its last four races.
“Marie and Liz have been doing really well, so we wanted to give them a shot at A division,” Jumper said. “They held their own and performed well, especially with the crazy range of conditions we had.”
The pair’s marked improvement throughout the weekend complemented Harvard’s strong effort in the B division and pushed the Crimson ahead of fifth-place finisher Brown by 10 points.
NEW ENGLAND FRESHMAN CHAMPIONSHIP/NICKERSON TROPHY
Five freshmen competed for the Nickerson Trophy over the weekend, earning ninth with consistent showings in the A and B divisions. Ryan Byrne and Alma Lafler manned the A boat throughout the 14-race competition, while skipper Sam Millham paired with crews Sarah McCuskee and Jinyan Zang.
Although the freshmen did not post as strong results as their upperclassman counterparts—earning ninth and eighth, respectively, in the two divisions—Himler emphasized the importance of building on such competitions.
“I think [the freshmen] will be competing at a high level very soon,” he said. “We’ll need them to step up, whether in this year or in coming years, and they got some good experience this weekend to see how they stack up, what to work on, and how to improve. It was a very good experience for them.”

In what could almost be contrived as a follow-up to this summer's run-in with the Cambridge police, Harvard has now taken to developing its own meter to determine if in fact people are implicitly racist or sexist. Enter "Project Implicit."
The system uses Pavlovian conditioning to have the user sort cropped faces into left and right categories, originally denoted as "European American" or "African American," a red 'X' signaled when the user makes a selection of which the program does not approve. The second round then replaces these titles with "Bad" and "Good," now flashing words intended to be sorted based on connotations. Later rounds permutate "Good" and "Bad" with "European American" and "African American," in the race test, to measure changes in reaction times when, for example, "Good" is paired with "European American" or "Bad" with "African American". The results of this say how racist the user is.
But the Implicit Association Test seems to be flawed from the start, presumably yielding only the results it is intended to: that, in fact, you are a racist. Or a sexist. Or that based on the given test, results were inconclusive to conclusively say that you are a racist, but you probably are.
More info on the project after the jump.
Project Implicit offers a whole range of implicit association tests, from other races and various skin tones to a sexuality IAT. Again, FlyBy wonders what these tests seek to achieve. Such a program builds itself only on the ability to highlight racism where none may actually exist. This likely exacerbates the issue of racism, doing nothing to combat it, but trivializes it to the scale of what could be a Facebook app. Tired of the same old liberal versus conservative grids? Instead, check out my bigot meter... telling you that when I see faces of black people, I think to press "Bad" instead of "Good." FlyBy actually wonders how much the design of this program forces these unexpected results. Though, consequently, you should probably expect to learn you are a racist.
FlyBy does remember this email forward from couple years back, but only recently has it won the appendage of being a "Harvard"-branded product, the most startling part of this whole affair. Glad to know that Harvard is now on top of things when it comes to combatting racism on campus... by reminding people that they are, in fact, racists.

The monotony of dining hall dinners got you down? Looking for a little something to awaken your taste buds? Those seeking to venture outside the predictable offerings of the HUDS meal plan should check out newly-opening Congas Bar and Restaurant. Located on the corner of Eliot and Winthrop Streets (a little ways back behind Grendel’s Den), Congas will be hosting its grand opening tomorrow night.
Complimentary appetizers will be served starting at 7:30 p.m.—and who doesn’t love free stuff!? More after the jump.
Restaurant partner Mauricio Rocha described Congas as a fusion of Spanish tapas and Latin American and Caribbean flavors, offering a variety of ranging from mofongo con camarones (mashed plantains with shrimp) to asado argentino (Argentinian steak).
“We want to create a world where you can just relax and listen to music by Celia Cruz, the queen of salsa,” Rocha said.
Panja S. Lymswam, Congas’ owner, reiterated the emphasis on creating a lively atmosphere with good, fun music, saying he hoped to create a “night-club like” ambiance at Congas.

Most of us eat chocolate. Now--at least according to School for Engineering and Applied Sciences Professor David Edwards--we should inhale it.
Le Whif, an inhalable chocolate in three flavors (mint, raspberry, and dark chocolate!) is touring the House dining halls this week as a preview to the opening of The Laboratory at Harvard. Find out more (and see a video of Le Whif) after the jump.
That big open space at the bottom of NW labs (currently filled with red couches, ideal for a quick nap) will be transformed into an exhibition space--the opening celebration will take place Sun., Nov. 8 at 6:30 in NW labs--for inventions that bridge art and science, according to Laboratory employees.
For example: do you ever listen to your heart beating? It turns out healthier hearts sound more musical than unhealthy hearts, and Yi Wei '10 has used this idea to create Gigue, an interactive musical experience that will be featured at the opening celebration. Audience members can step up and have data collected on their heart beats turned into a song. Pretty cool.
The opening celebration will be followed by a datamatics performance in Sanders by digital artist Ryoji Ikeda.

Harvard Alumni Association Senior Class Coordinator Alexandra Monti just announced in an e-mail to the senior class that Leverett House residents Michelle M. Parilo '10 and Nimi P. Katragadda '10 will serve as class secretary and treasurer, respectively (forever), having been selected by application process. Description of the two positions after the jump.
According to HAA:
Historically, after graduation, the Class Secretary becomes the key-operating officer of the class.  It is important for the Secretary to take an interest in keeping the class together and to be familiar with all that is going on at the University as well as keep the class involved in between reunion activities.
Every class needs to have secretarial functions performed.  These duties are not arduous and can be a lot of fun for the right individual.  During the senior year and after graduation, the Secretary should attend all Class Committee meetings and take the minutes for the permanent Class record.  These minutes, if turned in to the Harvard Alumni Office, will be distributed by the HAA to the entire Class Committee prior to the next meeting.
After graduation, there must be someone who will prepare newsletters at regular intervals, keep track of classmates, record the class' necrology, and be in charge of communications.  While we have no hard and fast recommendations to make on mechanisms, it should be obvious that this is a most important role and the person in charge should be diligent and attentive to detail.  Newsletters also gain in importance if their editors have sufficient literary ability and creativity to make the product interesting rather than just a collection of official notices and personal items.  The Class Secretary is also responsible for sending class notes to the Harvard Magazine and should keep track of those that have been published and those that have not. The Harvard Magazine is mailed to all domestic graduates six times a year.  The Class Secretary also works with the Class Report Office on the production of the Class Report that is published quinquennially at the time of the reunion.
The Class Secretary will become a member of the Association of Harvard College Class Secretaries and Treasurers which is a dues paying organization.  The Association meets every spring in Cambridge to keep itself up to date on the College's activities and is an excellent vehicle for exchanging ideas.
The Harvard Alumni Association stands ready to assist in any way they can.  Samples of class mailings and records can be found in the HAA office.  For more information see Class Secretary Suggested Minimum Standards.
Suggested Minimum Standards for Class Secretaries
1. Keeps the Class together and keeps track of classmates, including the class necrology.
2. Attends all Class Committee meetings and generally promotes and participates in class activities.
3. Serves as principal class communicator, which includes contacting the class at least once a year in writing via letter or newsletter.
4. Arranges class events—at least one a year—in non-reunion years, or ensures that someone does so.
5. Works with the Class Report Office on each quinquennial Class Report or appoints another classmate to do so eighteen months prior to projected publication date.
6. With appropriate Class Committee assistance, makes sure that Reunion Chair or Co-Chairs are appointed every five years and that it is done at least eighteen months prior to the projected reunion dates.
7. Announces the names of the Class Report Chair and Reunion Chair(s) at the annual spring meeting of the AHCCS&T the year before the Reunion.
8. Attends the Annual Meeting of the AHCCS&T every year.  If unable to attend, selects a substitute representative—the Class Treasurer, if available, or if not, another class officer or active classmate.
9. Submits information for class notes to Harvard Magazine (and, for some classes, to the Radcliffe Quarterly), and encourages classmates to do so directly.
10. Joins the Class Treasurer and the Class Committee in ensuring that the Class remains solvent through the collection of dues, when needed, and other means.  This includes raising sufficient funds during reunion years to pay for the Reunion and the Class Report.
11. Submits an Activity Report annually to the Class Committee with a copy to the HAA.
12. Encourages the Class Treasurer to submit a summary financial report annually.
13. With appropriate Class Committee assistance, promotes the Class by recommending classmate candidates for Overseer, HAA Elected Director, Harvard Medals, and HAA awards.
Description of the position of Harvard Class Treasurer
The financial management of the Class is another vitally important function of continuing class activities.  Since the College provides no financial support for social activities (except in certain of the reunion years), the Class must raise and maintain a treasury, ordinarily through class dues, events, or the sale of Class memorabilia.  A solid class treasury can help to subsidize a portion of many class activities or even provide a free class party at regular intervals.  Additionally, the treasury must be able to absorb the cost of regular newsletters and notices, a particular challenge as the costs of both printing and postage continue to skyrocket.  Some classes start by asking for Class dues of $15.00 per year and increase them later as the ability to pay increases.
In the past, Classes left the University with little or no money in their treasury.  This has taken a turn.  Now the graduating classes have run moneymaking events during their senior year with the assistance of the Harvard Alumni Association. Consequently, the classes are now leaving the University with an amount that enables them to do many things, including mailings prior to the Fifth Reunion informing class members of future events.  The Class Treasurer works closely with the Class Secretary deciding on the budget and logistics of Class events.  For more information see Class Treasurer Suggested Minimum Standards.
Suggested Minimum Standards for Class Treasurers
1. Sees that all Class bills are paid on a timely basis including those handled by a Reunion Treasurer or Special Event Treasurer.
2. Ensures that all Class bank accounts are signed by at least one other Class Officer and/or one of the Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association staff at 124 Mount Auburn.
3. Completes a Summary Financial Report for each calendar year and submits it to the Class Committee, the Class Secretary, and the HAA office by March 1st of the following year.
4. Monitors all Class accounts, communicates with the Class Secretary and other Class Officers if funds are low, and works with the HAA and appropriate Class Officers to replenish the treasury when necessary.
5. Keeps the Class Committee, the Class Secretary, and the HAA office aware of Treasurer's current address and telephone number, and of the location of all Class accounts.
6. Works with the HAA office, the Class Secretary, and other Class officers to find a successor if necessary.
7. Attends the annual meeting of the Association of Harvard College Class Secretaries and Treasurers and all Class Committee and reunion meetings whenever possible.
8. Sends information received regarding classmates to the Class Secretary.
9. Works with the Reunion Treasurer and the HAA office to be sure that the Reunion and the Class Report are completely self-supporting financially, except when the Class leadership determines that the Class Treasury will help provide support.  This includes:
•   providing a Class financial status report and "seed" money to the Reunion Treasurer upon request, and
•   requiring a complete financial report from the Reunion Treasurer that details the disbursements and receipts associated with the Reunion immediately following the reunion if possible.
10. Has the latitude to appoint an Assistant Treasurer.
11. Plays an active role in Class Committee meetings and Class activities.
