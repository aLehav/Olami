After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admissions rates have long been low at Harvard, and as they get lower and lower each year, the bar set for high school hopefuls gets higher and higher. Every year, it seems, we report a lower threshold than before—we dipped below six percent for the first time in 2012.
As admissions get more selective, the market for those looking to increase their chance of admission gets more and more pricey. There are countless services that offer the chance to raise SAT and ACT scores, websites that purport to tell you your chances of being admitted to various institutions, and even admissions consultants, who can begin crafting applications and resumes for future college students as early as their freshman year of high school.
The lengths some will go to in order to gain admission got more publicity in recent days after a lawsuit was filed against a former Harvard lecturer and assistant professor Mark J. Zimny. Zinny reportedly took over $2 million from Gerald and Lily Chow of Hong Kong under the guise that he was making donations for them to top universities to help their sons’ admissions chances.
Zimny was not accredited by the Independent Educational Consultants Association, and the Chows allege that he did not make the donations the way he promised he would. Even if he had, however, it seems obvious that such actions are lamentable, not to mention of questionable efficacy.
Accredited consultants were quick to disavow Zimny following the lawsuit, calling his alleged practices “exploitation.” However, it bears mentioning that, speaking generally, college consultants can hardly guarantee to be effective in helping students to admission to top-tier schools.
Too often, the myth circulates that there is some sort of ideal Harvard student, and that everyone here or at other good schools is some variation of that archetype. As a result, industries survive on the attempt to help students fit this mythical mold, or rather, appear to fit it on their application.
Students and parents hoping to force themselves into this sort of perfectly packaged gift to an admissions officer should know that such tactics, and checking what they assume are all the right boxes, do not alone lead to success. It seems more reasonable to presume that you are better off selling your real personality and interests, and to be passionate in doing so. Students at Harvard are many things, but they could hardly be called cookie cutter, and those seeking admission would be well advised to ditch the mold in favor of some flavor.

Recently, a few friends asked me about my next op-ed’s topic, and my accurate reply—“the U.S.-Chinese exchange rate”—struck with a deafening blandness. I tacked on with a mumble, “Maybe I’ll come up with something more interesting.” Unfortunately, I haven’t.
I stuck with it in part because I had this reassuring (and at least somewhat true) statistic to bolster me: 86 percent of Americans are concerned about the yuan-dollar exchange rate. They are worried about China. Per a recent Gallup poll, a majority of respondents, 51 percent, called themselves “very concerned… about trade relations with China.” Another 35 percent expressed some concern. (Notably, only one percent professed absolutely “no opinion”—among them, apparently, the people I call friends.) Ultimately, to be concerned about “trade relations with China” almost necessarily entails concern about the yuan-dollar exchange rate. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has vowed to brand China as a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency; meanwhile, Barack Obama has verbally (sans the legal ramifications Mr. Romney supports) labeled China as a manipulator and, although not tied to currency manipulation, also levied tariffs on Chinese tire imports.
Here is the manipulation tale, in short. The Chinese government accumulates large quantities of foreign, especially U.S., assets. The outflow of Chinese capital to achieve this tends to depress the world price of the renminbi, or “people’s currency,” better known as the yuan. In the face of cheaper Chinese imports, U.S. competitors suffer and employ fewer Americans. Studies have placed job losses anywhere from 200,000 to 3 million. A giant, veritable “sucking sound,” as Ross Perot put it.
There are, however, a few less visible (or, in the case of Perot’s sucking sound, less audible) mitigating factors. For one, goods made in China aren’t exactly Chinese goods. A study by the San Francisco Fed determined that, “on average, of every dollar spent on an item labeled “Made in China,” 55 cents go for services produced in the United States.” That’s in contrast to 36 cents repatriated on imports from countries other than China. That 19-point spread matters—especially because a higher exchange rate will likely shift, not eliminate, imports. Moreover, Baizhu Chen, professor at USC’s Marshall School of Business, points out that the San Francisco Fed’s value-added numbers reveal a $70 billion surplus for the U.S. in its trade with China, not the official, towering deficit.
For mitigating factor number two: Whatever the trade imbalance, currency manipulation doesn’t drive it. Research by Peter Navarro of UC Irvine attributes a mere 11-12 percent of the “China price” (the price advantage of Chinese goods in the U.S. market) to currency manipulation. Among other factors, government subsidies and low domestic wages hold more weight, especially the latter.
Finally, another mitigating factor is important to consider. The yuan is rising. Since a strict dollar peg was removed seven years ago, the yuan has risen 40 percent against the dollar, adjusting for inflation. And The Economist’s appealingly named Big Mac Index, which measures purchasing-power parity through McDonalds’ iconic sandwich, tells more. The raw index shows the yuan as undervalued. But that doesn’t account for an additional variable, unrelated to currency manipulation: lower GDP-per-capita countries like China tend to have cheaper currencies (through lower productivity and lower wages). Factoring in this exogenous trait, The Economist finds near-parity between the yuan and the dollar.
Probably less trustworthy, the Chinese government has echoed this claim. But perhaps it’s begun to realize its nation doesn’t even benefit from its own manipulation. China buys U.S. assets, and then sends the U.S. more and more manufactured products—all in exchange for the precious opportunity to spend long hours making those products, dump the revenue back into U.S. assets to depress the exchange rate, rinse, and repeat.
All of these words above, of course, merely amount to mitigating circumstances. But they are appended to the fact that cheap Chinese goods have greatly benefited U.S. consumers, especially the poor, who dedicate a disproportionate amount of their income to consumer goods. That’s worth preserving, and there’s a dangerous alternative scenario that threatens: a war of trade sanctions. To those relying on mutually assured destruction as a deterrent, imports aren’t warheads. Even two longtime partners, the U.S. and E.U., waged the long and bizarre “banana wars” trade battle, which germinated with E.U. banana sanctions and spilled over into luxury goods. If oblong, yellow fruit can ignite a trade war, anything can.
In the end, the core issue isn’t currency manipulation, especially as steeply rising Chinese wages obsolete any true ill effects (China has already risen above India and Mexico in manufacturing outsource costs). Intellectual property violations remain endemic, dampening innovation in both America and China. And that accompanies a broader Chinese atmosphere arrayed against foreign business, including domestic favoritism through subsidies, certification rules to block foreign products, and other regulations. In that light, we should be “concerned about trade relations with China.” But the ballyhooed exchange rate is merely a distraction. Abroad and at home, the United States finds itself confronted with real, critical problems. Both candidates realize that. But they refuse to realize: Chinese currency manipulation isn’t one of them.

Drones have had a bad month. Just last week, the Israeli Defense Forces intercepted a drone (an unmanned aerial vehicle) flying toward Israel’s Negev Desert. Likely launched from Hezbollah-controlled south Lebanon and perhaps headed towards Israel’s Dimona nuclear reactor, the mission, despite its failure, led to a measure of handwringing in Israel and gloating in Iran. Meanwhile, dozens of Western peace activists traveled to Islamabad to protest Pakistan’s atrocious human rights record. Just kidding. They were there to participate in a convoy bound for South Waziristan to protest American drone strikes, a lynchpin of American strategy for securing Afghanistan’s borders with Pakistan. Because of these recent developments, now seems like an appropriate time for a reminder of why drones are a boon for both the United States and human rights.
The statistics, from both governmental and independent sources, are quite conclusive on the effectiveness of drone strikes both as a military tactic and as a tactic for avoiding damage to civilians. According to the Long War Journal, between 2006 and October 1, 2012, drone strikes in northwestern Pakistan killed approximately 2,400 Taliban, al Qaeda, and other insurgent operatives versus only about 140 civilians.
Some institutes point out the unavoidable challenges in confirming deaths and therefore estimate the number of killed civilians to be slightly higher and the number of killed insurgents to be slightly lower. What no one can dispute, however, is the remarkable strike rate, particularly when compared to the casualty rates of conventional war.
These strikes are not only wiping out threats, but they are also preventing present insurgent forces from organizing themselves effectively. Pir Zubair Shah’s excellent article in Foreign Policy exposed the blistering effect of American drone strikes on the Taliban and insurgent groups. He writes, “The Taliban and al Qaeda had stopped using electronic devices…They would no longer gather in huge numbers, even in mosques to pray, and spent their nights outside for safety, a life that was wearing thin.”
Of course, numbers and anecdotes cannot tell the whole story. A more challenging issue to resolve is whether this strategy trades short-term benefits for long-term regional instability, not to mention long-term distrust of American foreign policy. Although such analyses, like that offered in last month’s report from Stanford Law School, offer accurate critiques of America’s reliance on drone strikes, they cannot really offer any strategic alternatives besides either ignoring North Waziristan with crossed fingers or invading the region. Neither of those options is consistent with our goal of securing Afghanistan.
Critics, besides those who instinctively lambast any display of American power, tend to focus on two problems of moral hazard.
The first moral hazard relates to the creation of a “videogame effect.” The theory is that as the military’s reliance on drones rises, so too does the risk that drone operators will forget that those shapes on a screen are actually human beings. The problem with this theory is that it is, as our vice president might say, malarkey. Although the number of militants killed per strike stayed at approximately six from 2004 to 2012, the number of civilians or unknowns killed per strike has actually declined from a 10.7 in the period from 2004 to 2007 to 0.7 in 2011 and a stunning 0.1 thus far in 2012.
The other moral hazard point, raised by the New York Times, is the precedent set by being the first country to use unmanned drones to kill enemies across borders. As American Civil Liberties Union National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi eloquently stated, drone strikes set a precedent that “could be used tomorrow by nations with less respect for the right to life in particular, and human rights in general.” This hazard is real, but it is not actually a convincing argument against developing drones. Nations with less respect for human rights will not care whether a precedent has been set by the United States before developing unmanned aerial vehicles.
Which brings us back to Hezbollah’s drone. Michael B. Oren, besides being Israel’s Ambassador to America, is also an accomplished historian. In his book Six Days of War on Israel’s overwhelming victory in 1967, he points out that fear of an attack on Israel’s Dimona nuclear reactor in the Negev Desert was a decisive factor in Israel’s decision to preemptively strike Egypt’s military during the Six-Day War. Last week’s drone, flying over Gaza and bound for the Negev, may appear to Israel’s military as a case of déjà vu. Regardless of whether or not Hezbollah’s drones could truly provide any tactical advantage, they heighten Israel’s sense of insecurity at a particularly fragile time.
I would be remiss not to incorporate the impending election into this column somehow. As Obama and Romney likely will discuss in their upcoming debates, they both intend to extend the use of drone strikes into the near future. Unless Gary Johnson or Jill Stein pulls off a miracle, they will remain an important component of American military strategy. And that’s a good thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the oral arguments may be over for the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the conversation has certainly not ended for Harvard undergraduates.
About 40 students gathered at the Institute of Politics on Friday night to consider the high profile legal case that has called into question race-based affirmative action policies in undergraduate admissions processes.
The Court’s ruling on the suit, filed by Abigail Fisher, a white woman denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin, could affect Harvard’s own admission policy, said Law School professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who led the discussion. Earlier this year, Harvard filed an amicus brief in support of the University of Texas.
“If the Court decides to overturn Grutter, the decision would have an impact on Harvard because it would presumptively prohibit the use of race in private universities covered by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,” she said after the discussion, referring to the Court’s decision to uphold the University of Michigan’s affirmative action policy in the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case.
Brown-Nagin, who specializes in constitutional law, kicked off the conversation with an overview of how the Court’s changing ideology has affected this case, saying that the increased number of conservative justices played a role in the reconsideration of affirmative action less than a decade after Grutter v. Bollinger.
From there, Brown-Nagin addressed the various arguments both for and against affirmative action policies. In particular, Brown-Nagin rebutted the suggestion that race-based affirmative action places a negative “stigma” on minority students.
Brown-Nagin also discussed a number of ways the Supreme Court could rule, ranging from a four-to-four tie—which would effectively rule in favor of the University of Texas admissions policy—to ruling in favor of Fisher.
Regardless of whether or not the ruling may affect the Harvard admissions process, Brown-Nagin said that students should follow this case since it “relates to so many social, political, and cultural currents of today.”
Madeline C. Connors ’15 said she attended the event because she has had a number of discussions about the Fisher case and wanted to further her understanding of the implications it may have on admissions. “This was a topic that came up in my classes, with my friends,” Connors said, “so I came to talk to people and see what they have to say about it.”
Angela S. Berkowitz ’15, who coordinated the event, has followed the case closely and hopes other students will too. “I think this is a really interesting case of how history can be made, so it’s important to know what’s going on,” she said.
Henry H. Wang ’15, described the discussion as “enlightening” and said he now has a more “inside view on what the Supreme Court feels”.
As to how they thought the Supreme Court was going to rule, responses varied with many saying they are unsure.
Jacob T. Morello ’15 believes the Supreme Court should rule in favor of race-based affirmative action.  “We haven’t quite reached the place where college admissions are completely unbiased, but I think we’re well on our way,” he said.
The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in late spring of next year.

Normally, brunches aren’t sing-a-longs. But it wasn’t a typical brunch.
Audience members sang to Rabbi Ben-Zion Gold’s new CD “Touching the Memory,” a compilation of Polish-Jewish melodies, at a special Sunday brunch held at Hillel in the former director’s honor.
The songs, a mixture of religious and folk tunes, were recorded, for the most part, one night nearly 40 years ago by Jane Myers ’70, who met Gold as an undergraduate and produced his new CD. The melodies are from Gold’s childhood in Poland before the Holocaust. Born in 1923, Gold left Poland to become director of Harvard Hillel in 1958 where he served as director until 1993.
“How did you remember those songs?” Myers asked Gold during the discussion.
“I think the correct question is, ‘How could you forget?’” he answered. “It became part of me.” Gold is nearly a nonagenarian, but his good humor remains, along with his memory for melodies and lyrics.
The album’s production has been a long time coming, Myers said. “I feel like I had this treasure, and it was just schlepping along,” said Myers. She had kept an audio-cassette of Gold’s music in her basement for years after the original recording in 1976, and remembers the night that most of the recordings were done.
“Ben just sat there, with his back to the window and he sang through 11 songs, one after another. He said that night, ‘I think I was possessed’—is that right?”
“If you say so,” quipped Gold.
Myers recorded an additional 17 tracks in 2003; including the 11 earlier tracks, the CD has a total 28 songs.
This recording is important because this is the first time many of these songs have been officially documented, according to Myers, who has checked with Jewish libraries and museums across the world.
“There are not many people left alive,” said Marc A. Cohen ’85, a member of Harvard Hillel’s Board of Directors. “Those that survived are few and far between, so this sort of thing would have been just lost.”
When tracks from the new CD were played during the brunch, Gold mouthed along with his own, younger voice. When Myers played the song Gold’s father used to sing during passover, Gold continued to sing even after the track had finished. He couldn’t remember whether his father had composed the song, and if he hadn’t, Rabbi Gold said, “he may as well have.”
“You can’t tell now because his voice...well—he’s close to 90 years old,” Cohen said. “But you got a taste of it from the recording.”
Myers hopes to take this CD to talks and presentations in order to share and archive the songs in libraries in the United States, Israel and other Jewish History museums around the world.

On Saturday evening, Jasmine Y. Miller ’13 and her roommate Georgia V. Stasinopoulos ’13 were sitting in their dorm room when Miller showed Stasinopoulos a new post on The Harvard Voice’s blog that she found alarming.
Attributed to “The Voice Staff,” the post on the blog of the student life magazine poked fun at the on-campus recruiting process for consulting and finance jobs by identifying five types of people someone might encounter at a pre-interview reception. Second on the list was “The Asian.”
The post said about Asian interviewees, “They dress in the same way (satin blouse with high waisted pencil skirt for girls, suits with skinny ties for boys), talk in the same sort-of gushy, sort-of whiny manner, and have the same concentrations and sky-high GPAs. They’re practically indistinguishable from one another, but it’s okay. Soon, they will be looking at the same Excel spreadsheets and spend their lunch talking about their meaningful morning conversations with the help desk of Bloomberg. Uniqueness is overrated when you make six-figure salaries.”
Miller, who is half Asian, immediately commented on the piece and emailed The Voice’s editors, April A. Sperry ’13 and Michelle B. Nguyen ’13. She received an apologetic email from Sperry.
The editors of The Voice then modified the article, changing “The Asian” to “The Overachieving Asian,” and then again to “The Super-Interviewee.” Further, the editors changed the byline from “The Voice Staff” to “Anonymous,” removed all comments, and disabled the comments feature for that post.
In an editors’ note, they apologized for the potentially offensive content. “Though the article was written by an anonymous contributor, we have removed the inappropriate content because it is not in line with The Voice’s mission of promoting satirical, yet inclusive, content,” the note said.
At first, that text below the post was followed by a note from the writer, which said, “Clearly, I’ve been censored, which in itself is an interesting reflection on free speech in America. If you couldn’t tell that this article was satire, then we have bigger problems than me being ‘offensive.’ (If you are curious to know what the censored stereotype is, just take a quick look around the room. JK!)”
By Sunday afternoon, the writer’s note had been removed.
Stasinopoulos—who along with Miller once tried to found a student life blog to compete with Very Noice, The Voice’s blog where the problematic post appeared—said she thought that The Voice did not go far enough in retracting the post. “I don’t understand why the post is still up,” she said.
Miller listed negative stereotypes that the post touched on. “The perpetual foreigner—this weird other that doesn’t interact with the rest of the student population or America—that’s an often-invoked stereotype,” she said. “And then the idea of Asians as an un-individuated mass. You can’t distinguish them from each other; they’re not original; they don’t have their own voice.”
Miller also pointed to the racially charged language of other items on the list. One of the other four types, “The Final Club Bro,” she noted, was described as blue-eyed, which Miller interpreted as white. “You just said Asian people can’t be final club bros,” she said.
Pamela Yau ’14, co-president of the Harvard Radcliffe Asian American Association, said that the blog post spurred a discussion on her organization’s email list of racism toward Asians. The Chinese Student Association passed the offensive paragraph over its email list as well.
“It’s sad that there are still these stereotypes that exist about Asian people,” Yau said. “Even if the post was written in a joking way, trying to be humorous, I think that to group all the Asians together still plays to that stereotype that Asians are always trying to fight against and speak up about. We do appreciate the fact that there was a backlash.”
The backlash at this point has been much less dramatic than the reaction to a column published by an Asian writer in The Crimson in 2001, which opened a discussion of Asian behavior and self-segregation at Harvard by stating, “Most Harvard Asians can be pretty frickin’ lame. Yes, the Asian people at this college make me sick.” After outraged letters to the editor and a march on The Crimson by about 50 students, the newspaper published an apology and retracted the article.
All five posts on Very Noice since May have been written under the bylines “The Voice Staff” or “Some Dude.” Sperry, who is listed on The Voice’s website as one of two presidents and editors-in-chief of the publication last school year, declined to comment. Nguyen could not be reached for comment on Sunday afternoon.

Panelists at the Institute of Politics said that debates are playing a stronger role in the presidential elections, because of an increase in political advertising.
Moderated by Institute of Politics Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, the event attracted many freshman and their parents, many of whom were visiting during Freshman Parents Weekend. During the discussion, Grayson noted the increased importance of the presidential debates due to the oversaturation of ads on television.
“Ironically, the debates are what have come to shape the race,” said panelist Nina J. Easton, an IOP Fellow and columnist for Fortune Magazine.
Panelist Mark D. McKinnon, an IOP fellow and served as President George W. Bush’s communications strategist, expanded, saying that the voters have become “incredibly cynical and skeptical.” “There is a huge emphasis on authenticity—a debate is not packaged and is not controlled.”
When prompted by an audience member about Vice President Joseph Biden’s frequent smiling and laughing during the vice presidential debate, Easton said she was “surprised that it wasn’t more of a deal-breaker than it was.”
Panelists also weighted the effects of advertising and whether large fundraising efforts on both sides were significantly changing the race.
“There is a heavy air war going on right now primarily by Romney and the super PACs,” McKinnon said.
But Jonathan H. Alter ’79, a columnist for Bloomberg View, argued that “the super PAC money is no good on the ground,” where Obama has developed a strong base of supporters willing to take to the phones and persuade others to support their cause.
Looking more broadly at the election, Alter also likened the current race to that of Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. Although the president was unable to defeat Carter in the general election, “Ford began to close the gap” in September, he said. “Romney has some momentum now and it is a question of whether president Obama can break that momentum,” Alter said.
The members of the panel were also asked for their predictions on who would be the victor in November.
“I think both candidates will be in the 200 plus electoral votes,” sad Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo, a Lecturer on Government and Allston Burr Resident Dean of Dunster House. “But I’ll give [the edge] to Romney.”
The talk was “very informative and stimulating,” said Alan Dean, a parent of a Harvard College student.
“There’s a fairly high level of interest,” Grayson said in an interview with the Crimson. “One of the things that struck me is that there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm for [Democratic Mass. Senate Candidate and Harvard Law School professor] Elizabeth Warren, maybe more so than even Obama.”

Harvard Business School’s Kresge Hall will be torn down to make space for the new Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, following a $40 million donation by the Chao family, Harvard administrators announced Friday.
The Chao Center, which is expected to break ground in 2014, will serve as a central space for students from the Executive Education Program by providing classrooms, dining services, and offices.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria thanked the family members for their donations at the announcement of the new construction project, which is named after Ruth Mulan Chu Chao, wife of James Si-Cheng Chao and the mother of six daughters, four of whom graduated from the Business School.
“What a wonderful thing to have a building on this campus that is both named for a woman and comes from the gift of four daughters,” Nohria said. “It is so symbolic, so wonderful for us, to be able to announce this gift in a year in which we are celebrating 50 years of women graduating from Harvard Business School.”
The Chao family’s donation is the first gift the Business School has received from a family of Chinese descent. The Chaos are also the only family in history to have four daughters graduate from HBS.
“It’s just so great to see this family in its extended form,” Harvard President Drew G. Faust said. “We have these generations of dedication to what matters most here at Harvard to all of us, and that is the power of education to generate opportunity, to create possibility for everyone in our society, for women as well as men.”
Among the Chao family’s daughters is former Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, who served under George W. Bush and was the first Asian Pacific American to be appointed to a U.S. Cabinet. Chao, who received her M.B.A. from Harvard in 1979 and is married to Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, reflected on her mother’s legacy during their family’s immigration to the United States.
“The initial years in America were very difficult. Adjusting to a new life in a new country with a different language and culture was not easy, but, through it all, my mother’s quiet determination, her resilience, hope, and optimism supported our family,” Chao said.
From the Chao family’s gift, $35 million will go to the construction of the Chao Center and $5 million will be set aside for a fund to provide fellowships for Chinese heritage students at HBS.
“Our aspiration for the Chao fellowships is to enable the broadest range of outstanding promising students to access the financial means to be able to attend Harvard Business School,” Chao said.
The plans for the new Chao Center were announced as construction continues on Tata Hall, another building dedicated to the Executive Education Program at Harvard Business School. Tata Hall, a $100 million project made possible by a $50 million donation from India’s Tata Group, is expected to be completed in December 2013, months before construction on the Chao Center begins.
Also present at the announcement was Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who spoke about the significance of the Chao Center in light of Harvard’s continued construction on its Allston campus.
“This will be a world class building that will attract world class executives who will go back and do great things—start and grow companies, create jobs, and develop new products,” Menino said. “It demonstrates the direction that Boston’s moving as we build on our status as a leader in the global economy.”
The Chao Center will replace Kresge Hall, which was built in 1952 and currently serves primarily as an Executive Education dining facility. After Kresge Hall is torn down, the Business School will rename a street that runs through the area as Kresge Way.

The Philip Brooks House Association honored Co-Director of Industrial Areas Foundation Ernesto Cortes, Jr., on Friday for his work as a community organizer through IAF, which provides leadership development for the politically disenfranchised.
“It’s an honor for me to win this award, but most importantly it’s an honor for who I work with,” Cortes said, after receiving PBHA’s Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who spoke at the event, said that the award is an annual “reminder of the core values of the college,” adding that a college education should teach not only individual skills but also the value of public service.
“He shares the values of the organization and has inspired so many students,” said Misa M. Yasuda ’13, who is the PBHA alumni and history coordinator. “This event is an occasion to think about our role as agents of change.”
The award was established six years ago to honor former PBHA volunteer and Harvard Medical School professor Robert Coles ’50, who was present at the event.
During the lecture that followed the award, Cortes said that his aim is to create “a space for people to learn to negotiate, to argue, to compromise.”
“Expanding the base for organization to get new perspectives and new ideas is the only way to stop oligarchy,” he said, adding that “new people coming in” is what makes community organization successful.
Speaking about politics and the upcoming elections, Cortes critiqued the status quo, saying that the state has transformed people “from citizens to a managed electorate,” provoking a round of applause. “Politics is about a different kind of local engagement,” he said.
“Cortes is restoring American Democracy,” said Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service and a former community organizer for IAF in Texas.
During the Q&A session following the lecture, one audience member asked Cortes how he gets to young people before they become disenfranchised and disengaged. “The public education system has the responsibility to teach not just skills but also how to be citizens,” Cortes said. “We bring parents and school people together to teach the responsibilities of living in a democratic culture.”
When another audience member asked whether there have been situations in which compromise was not possible, Cortes’ answer was curt. “No,” he said.
Members of the crowd in Memorial Church said they were dazzled. “Get over yourself, Harvard: This man is better than us,” said Corbin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An art show featuring pieces from around the world on faith and compassion attracted a diverse group of students, community members, and artists alike for a preview this Friday.
The popularity of the opening of the show, “Compassion: The Good Samaritan,” was due in part to how relevant the artwork is to a general audience, said Olivia J. Krusel ’15, a member of Harvard College Faith and Action, the organization responsible for organizing the exhibition.
“The fact that it’s at Harvard is a draw, but it’s something that everyone can relate to,” Krusel said.
Jade R. Luo ’14, another HCFA organizer, agreed that the show is relevant to all faiths. “It’s really cool, I think, to see and compare, whether Christian or non-Christian, this idea of what compassion is,” she said.
Rosemary Irvine, who came to Harvard from Oradell, N. J., to visit her daughter for Freshman Parents Weekend, said that she was drawn to the exhibition by its reference to the story of the Good Samaritan, her favorite Biblical parable. To her, the story lets you “see [people’s] good, see them the right way, not judging a book by its cover.”
Artist Michelle A. Paine stated that this show’s patrons said they were drawn by how the exhibition aims to make a real impact on its visitors. “I hope that there would be some sense that art is not just some ethereal, intellectual thing but something that could actually make a difference, either through a spiritual insight or through action,” she said.
In line with the theme of the exhibition, most of the proceeds from the art sales go to a charity called Compassion International, according to curator Roni Pavick.
Pavick hoped that the show would create a “visual voice” and spark dialogs about the meaning of compassion and how to act upon it.
“Every day we pass by people who need our compassion but we don’t see it,” Slovenian artist David Fartek said, in reference to the parable. “You need love to see. Maybe [the visitors] also see there is not enough compassion and they want to share."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 16, 2012, at 11:42 p.m.
Walking through the rows of booths selling everything from organic eggplants to locally-made chocolate, Stefanie Chorianopoulos ’15 munches on an apple from Ward’s Berry Farm on her way to lecture in Northwest Labs. Chorianopoulos, who grew up near the farm’s Sharon, Mass., location and remembers going apple picking there as a child, buys a small bag of apples from its stand at the Farmers’ Market at Harvard each week.
With vendors offering products including produce, maple syrup, and local seafood, the Farmers’ Market held each fall has become an opportunity for Harvard University Dining Services to reach out to smaller farms.
Begun as a project of HUDS and the HUDS Food Literacy Project, the Farmers’ Market at Harvard opened in 2005, with its sister market held in Allston on Fridays beginning three years later.
The construction on the Science Center Plaza this fall has temporarily moved the Cambridge-location to a spot in front of the Harvard Museum of Natural History on Oxford St. Despite a drop in foot traffic each Tuesday, vendors, students, and market organizers say that the event provides an opportunity to make connections between students and local farmers too small to be vendors for Harvard’s dining halls.
“We try to have a good mix of vendors, creating a good environment for the consumer,” says Louisa C. Denison ’11, the Food Literacy Project coordinator.
“FACE TO FACE WITH A FARMER”
Over the past decade, HUDS has increasingly focused on offering local foods—which it defines as from within a 250-mile radius of Cambridge—in its dining halls and on-campus restaurants. But with 13 undergraduate dining halls, 14 retail dining locations, and its own catering operation, HUDS must rely more on suppliers able to provide for such a large-scale operation.
These two competing priorities have often made it difficult for smaller local farms to have a presence in Harvard’s ecosystem. The two farmers markets provide this opportunity for vendors to sell products that they could not provide on such a large scale to Harvard’s more institutional dining services.
For example, Ward’s Berry Farm has provided squash to Harvard’s dining halls, but sells a wider range of produce at the weekly farmers’ market.
Other regular vendors at the market include Lanni Orchards, a farm in Lunenburg, Mass.; When Pigs Fly, a bakery in Somerville, Mass.; and Cape Ann Fresh Catch, a fishery based in Gloucester, Mass.
Dave J. Purpura, the owner Plato’s Harvest Organic Farm in Middleboro, Mass., is the only organic produce vendor at Harvard’s Farmer’s Market. He owns a farm that is not at the size or scale where he can wholesale food. Harvard’s market is one of only two that Purpura attends each week.
“I like to tell people how to do things,” Purpura says as he explains the best way to eat some of his produce to another customer. “It’s all about being able to talk to the person. They’re paying the person that made their food. It’s not going into some corporate hole.”
Vendors pay a nominal fee to participate in the market for costs like landscaping, city permits, and advertising, but apart from that, anything else the vendor makes is his own.
“There is no middle man,” Denison said.
This direct connection between seller and customer has made the Farmers’ Market appealing to both sides.
“I think it’s pretty cool because that makes it accessible to students and postdocs like me who are too busy to go shopping,” Kathryn E Goldfarb, a postdoctoral fellow, based in nearby CGIS, says.
The farm-to-table aspects of the farmers’ market system is similarly important for Dale Wentworth, who worked in the business sector before starting The Warren Farm & Sugarhouse in North Brookfield, Mass., nearly two decades ago. At the Harvard market, Wentworth sells the farm’s maple syrup, which he has learned to preserve and make a year-round crop.
“The Farmer’s Market concept works so well because you get to be face to face with a farmer,” Wentworth says.
TASTES OF NEW ENGLAND
The small farms that participate in Harvard’s weekly markets introduce students and staff in Cambridge to the wider offerings available locally. The Farmers’ Market tries to showcase, through its products and vendors, Harvard’s distinct New England location.
“[We try to show] what diverse products Massachusetts has,” Denison says.
Denison describes it as a “nice reminder” that we live “in the midst of a fairly agricultural region,” she says. “It’s a very physical, tangible reminder.”
“It feels like some of the local culture is brought to me,” Nicole C. Hirschhorn ’16 says as she eyed the Sicilian Green Olive & Hot Cherry Peppers bread at the When Pigs Fly tent.
The local food offered at Harvard’s markets is a chance for Harvard affiliates to connect more closely with their food than they could in a dining hall or grocery store, vendors say.
“It gives people a greater understanding of where their food comes from, in a completely basic sense,” Wentworth says.
From June to October, the Farmers’ Market has become a staple for many at Harvard.
“I wish it was every month,” Christine S. Benoit, a procurement manager at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Finance Office said. “I have it on the calendar. My coworkers definitely come down here all the time. The fridge is always full on Tuesday.”

Addressing issues ranging from the reported crackdown on underage drinking at final clubs to the recent stranger rapes, Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano presented crime statistics and took questions at Sunday night’s Undergraduate Council General Meeting.
The UC invited Catalano in response to student concerns about campus safety, especially in light of the two reported stranger rapes that occurred earlier this year.
“I received a lot of feedback, especially from freshmen, who were concerned about the rapes,” said Student Life Committee Chair Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news editor. “A lot of people do not feel safe at night.”
Catalano assured student representatives that HUPD had added uniformed and plain-clothes officer patrols in and around Harvard Yard. He said that increased police presence on the Yard has not taken away officers from other Harvard campuses.
George, who has said that campus safety is a priority for his committee, emphasized at Sunday’s meeting that he hopes to increase lighting along the walking route to the Quad.
Catalano offered advice for students to stay safe, encouraging them to store HUPD’s number in their phone, walk in groups at night, and use the University’s shuttle and evening van services. For students walking between the Yard and the Quad, he offered one additional suggestion: “I would avoid walking through the Cambridge Common and instead walk on the outside—on either side,” he said.
Catalano spent much of the night addressing other issues that affect students. He refuted the notion that HUPD and Cambridge Police initiated a crackdown targeting underage drinking earlier this semester. Instead, he said that violent incidents near final clubs last spring led to the increased police presence.
“There was no crackdown,” he said. “What actually happened is that Cambridge Police and HUPD jointly patrolled on Friday and Saturday nights.”
Though HUPD is not targeting underage drinkers, Catalano warned that students should always exercise good judgment.
“Mostly underage people felt that they could walk around with open containers. To quote the chief: ‘Mt. Auburn St. is not Bourbon St. North.’ If you walk around with open containers of alcohol, you are subject to arrest,” he said.
Throughout the meeting, Catalano emphasized HUPD’s goal of policing in partnership with the community. The department focuses on protecting students, Catalano said, and not necessarily making arrests. He pointed out that the University, and not HUPD, handles most disciplinary action.
“Our job is not to decide how you will be held accountable for your behavior,” he said. “However, if there is violence or destruction of property, that is another story.”
In addition to violent crime and vandalism, HUPD treats drug distribution very seriously, according to Catalano.
“There is a difference between possession of drugs and distribution of drugs,” he said. “When you distribute drugs, what is involved? Drugs and money. And when there is money and drugs, what will inevitably follow? Violence.”
Statistics provided by Catalano gave representatives a clearer idea of the types of crime most prevalent on campus. Between 2000 and 2011, there were an average of 46 violent crimes, some occurring in areas near campus, such as outside Au Bon Pain. During that same period, an average of 121 bikes were stolen each year.
While the overall crime rate has been reduced 25 percent over the last 10 years, almost all of the reduction can be attributed to declining property crime, which accounted for 93 percent of all crimes. In 2000, there were 814 reported property crimes; in 2011, that number had fallen to 508. HUPD statistics reveal an average of nine robberies per year during that same period.
Catalano reminded representatives that Harvard is located in an urban environment, and he said he advises students stay alert, secure their property, and report anything suspicious immediately to the HUPD.

UPDATED: Oct. 16, 2012, at 4:48 a.m.
Harvard Business School professor Alvin E. Roth was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday morning for his research on market design. He shares the prize, which is given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, with University of California, Los Angeles professor Lloyd S. Shapley ’44.
Roth, who has taught at Harvard since 1998, is currently a visiting professor at Stanford University and will leave for a full-time role there in January.
At a press conference in Palo Alto, Roth said the call he received in the wee hours of Monday morning was unexpected.“The people who call you up spend a good deal of their effort convincing you it’s not a prank call,” Roth said.
Roth said that he believes that many other economists deserve recogition as well and that his award represents a body of work much larger than his own.
“It’s nice to be the object of attention, but I would also like to deflect that attention to a lot of my colleagues,” he said.
Roth’s work has largely focused on how individuals, companies, and other institutions select one another in a variety of contexts, particularly in markets that do not have prices. He explained that many of life’s most significant events can be explained by “matching markets”—from choosing a school, to finding a partner, to starting a career.
His research has examined organ exchange and the process of assigning students to schools, including Boston public schools.
“The question is how to organize exchange,” Roth said. “We can help our surgical colleagues organize what you could call barter on a large scale [for organ transplants]. Market design is a sort of helping profession.”
Roth’s colleagues at Harvard said that they were happy, but unsurprised, by the award.
“This morning when I read the news I just put up a big smile on my face,” economics professor Gregory Lewis said. “I expected him to win the Nobel Prize at some point; it was just hard to predict the year when it would have happened.”
Lewis praised Roth’s ability to translate mathematical formulas into practice, noting that Roth has made a meaningful difference “in the kidney transplant sector, where market design matters in terms of saving lives.”
“I believe his work is very fruitful and inspiring for the whole field of market design,” he said.
Economics professor Ariel Pakes said that he was excited about Roth’s recognition.
“It’s a wonderful and well-deserved prize,” he said. “It’s great not just for him but for the entire field.”
Roth and Shapley will split approximately $1.2 million as a reward. Roth said he does not currently have plans for his use of the prize money.
Including Roth, 45 former or current Harvard faculty members have won the Nobel Prize in a wide range of disciplines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With back-to-back wins this weekend at Cornell (6-12, 2-5 Ivy) and Columbia (8-8, 3-4 Ivy), the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-11, 4-3 Ivy) jumped into a tie for third in the Ivy League.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
Each set against the Lions was close, but the Crimson found a way to close out each frame and win in straight sets, 25-23, 25-22, 25-20, in New York on Saturday.
Trailing 9-14 in the first set, it was not initially obvious that the Crimson would pull out a straight-set victory. But Harvard fought back to win the first set and rarely trailed for the rest of the match.
The second set was tight all the way, but after edging out Columbia to take a 2-0 lead, nine kills by captain outside hitter Docter in the third helped Harvard close out the match.
Docter had a double-double with 12 digs and a game-high 21 kills, and sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey led the game with 23 digs.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
After getting out to an early two-set lead, Harvard was able to hold on and defeat the Big Red in four sets, 25-19, 25-23, 25-27, 25-20, on Friday night in Ithaca.
Late in the second set, with the score tied, 22-22, junior right side Erin Cooney stepped up and scored three kills in the last four points to give the Crimson a commanding 2-0 lead that it would never relinquish.
The Crimson began to take control late in the first set, when it closed out the frame by winning 12 of the last 14 points after trailing, 13-17.
With Harvard seemingly poised to win the match in straight sets after winning the first two and holding a 21-16 lead in the third, Cornell closed on an 11-4 run to stay in the match.
Neither team could build up a large lead in the fourth, until a 4-0 run closed out the match for the Crimson.
Docter led Harvard with 14 kills, and Casey had a game-high 14 digs. Freshman setter Hannah Schmidt and senior setter Beth Kinsella led the team with 19 assists each.

The Harvard women’s soccer team put on an offensive clinic in the second half against Brown, scoring four goals en route to a convincing 4-1 victory on Saturday afternoon.
After a relatively quiet first half in Providence, R.I., every one of the game’s five goals came in a 17-minute span.
“Once one goal goes in, the next goals come really quickly,” junior forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “I think that after that second goal, we had a lot of fire and a lot of spirit, and we came through and scored more.”
Sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby led Harvard (6-3-3, 2-1-1 Ivy) with two goals, her fourth and fifth of the season. Junior forward Elizabeth Weisman and senior defender Taryn Kurcz netted the second and fourth Crimson scores, respectively.  After Saturday’s contest, Casscells-Hamby, Kurcz, and Weisman are the Crimson’s top three scorers.
Casscells-Hamby’s first goal of the match came at the 50-minute mark. Only eight minutes later, freshman midfielder Haley Washburn headed the ball off the crossbar, a shot that ultimately rebounded to Weisman, who sent the ball flying past the keeper and into the net.
Four minutes after Weisman connected, Casscells-Hamby knocked in her second goal of the game off a cross from freshman forward Lauren Varela. And with 23 minutes left in the contest, Kurcz initiated a give-and-go with Casscells-Hamby, resulting in strike from Kurcz that bounced off the left post and into the goal.
Before Saturday, Harvard had struggled to ignite its offense. In its last six contests, the team had just one multi-goal game.
But that trend ended against Brown (6-6-0, 0-4-0), as the Crimson’s four scores marked a new season high and matched the team’s output in its past three games combined.
“We just really finished our opportunities,” Casscells-Hamby said. “Whenever we got in front of the net we were really hungry for a goal, and once we got one in they all just started coming. So it was just really exciting to finally get the offensive part of our team going.”
On the night, Harvard tallied 17 shots while only allowing five, the third fewest shots from an opponent all season.
With the loss, Brown extended its losing streak to six games.
Only once this season have the Bears scored more than one goal, a non-conference matchup with Providence over a month ago.
For the Crimson, the victory was critical for the team’s Ivy title chances and kept Harvard within striking distance as the conference season reached its midway point.
With the win, Harvard moved into sole possession of fourth place in the Ivy League, five points behind first-place Princeton.
Although the Crimson will likely need to defeat each of its remaining conference opponents in order to win a second straight league crown, the team plans to stick with its season-long strategy of taking it one game at a time.
“We don’t really look toward the end,” Casscells-Hamby said. “We’re just really excited for our next game and we hope it turns out like this one. We definitely feel momentum coming, and it’s been really fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2011, Colton Chapple and the Harvard football team cruised to an easy 42-3 victory over Bucknell. Before the teams’ rematch on Saturday, I was expecting a fairly similar story.
Yes, Bucknell had the third-best rush defense in the FCS. And sure, Harvard coach Tim Murphy had said earlier in the week that the Bison defense would be one of the best the Crimson faced all season.
But through four games, the only thing that had any success in slowing down the Crimson attack was some early-season rust in Week One.
And since that 28-13 victory over San Diego, the Harvard offense had mowed down everything in its path. In Weeks Two through Four, Harvard averaged an ungodly 47.3 points per game—and even that understated the Crimson’s historic dominance. In two of those three games, Murphy pulled a number of starters long before the final whistle.
It’s not just the offense that made opposing Division I squads look like Pee Wee challengers.
The Harvard defense had done its fair share as well—against Cornell, especially. Facing one of the most potent offenses in the league and a quarterback with legitimate NFL potential, the defense played the iceberg to Cornell’s Titanic, allowing just 13 points in an easy 32-point win.
On Saturday, as expected, the Crimson won the battle against the Bucknell handily. By the end, that familiar plot line had emerged: Harvard had amassed an insurmountable lead by the half, the starters were pulled, and then the backups tried to put something together while the clock ticked toward zero.
And as expected, the Harvard defense had no problem against a Bison offense that, for most of the game, looked hopeless in trying to string together a drive. Only in the game’s waning moments did Bucknell get on the board.
But what didn’t I expect? In the first quarter, a seemingly different Crimson offense took the field. The attack that had ruthlessly bulldozed opposing defenses was asleep at the wheel.
For the first time all year, the Crimson failed to score on its opening drive. In that first quarter, senior quarterback Colton Chapple, who had completed 71.3 percent of his passes in the previous three games, went one for six with a couple bad overthrows and a pick.
Senior running back Treavor Scales, boasting 6.8 yards per rush entering Saturday, only averaged 3.8 on five carries in the first 15 minutes of Saturday’s game.
The Crimson only managed to score in that opening quarter thanks to a fortuitous fumble recovery deep in Bison territory. Even with that, Harvard held a tenuous 7-0 lead after one.
And you had to ask yourself: Was this going to be a game? Would Bucknell be the team—finally—to snap the Crimson’s nation-best winning streak?
The second quarter very starkly provided that answer: no.
As rough as Chapple was in the first quarter, he was that good in the second, completing nine of 11 passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns. Add in a 58-yard touchdown run from freshman Andrew Fischer, and the Crimson had opened up a commanding 28-0 lead by the half. That was that.
And with that, the first half of the season is in the books. Harvard is still perfect, 5-0, still unchallenged as the top team in Ivy League football.
If the first five games are any indication, that likely won’t change in the second five. Within the Ancient Eight, it looks like the Crimson is in a league of its own for the second straight season.
But a rather large question still looms: Just how good is this team? Put another way, could this go down as the most dominant Harvard team of the modern era?
205 points in five games—the most since the Harrison administration, when Harvard was playing teams like Phillips Exeter. That’s more than the 9-1 team from a year ago that broke the modern-era points record, more than Ryan Fitzpatrick’s 10-0 2004 team.
Meanwhile, the Crimson is allowing just 13.4 points a game and outscoring opponents by a laughable 27.6 margin. Only one other Ivy team has averaged more than 27.6 points, period, forget margin of victory.
Of course, five games does not a season make. But facing a quintet of league foes who look increasingly vulnerable to end the season (save Princeton, the surprise of the league), Harvard has the opportunity to make the answer to that question: yes.

Before he was the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney ran a race for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts and lost. That campaign against Edward M. Kennedy '56-'58 in 1994 was his first foray into politics, but it was not the business mogul's first race.
That distinction belongs to a very different type of race: a prep school cross country race during Romney's senior year at Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., a 1994 Crimson profile of Romney shows.
"Over the hill comes the first person, and it's not Mitt. Then, still no Mitt," Romney's former Cranbrook classmate Colin H. John, Jr. told The Crimson in 1994. "Finally, just as they're getting ready to start the third quarter of the game, the only person who hasn't finished is Mitt. He has just given everything he can give, but there ain't no more, and so he finally staggers into the Cranbrook oval."
Romney had run out of gas. He had not trained properly. He had no experience, and when put to the test his talent ran out, John said.
The profile, which quotes everyone from Romney's older brother to his Harvard Law School classmates, reveals a candidate not unlike the one currently trying to unseat fellow Harvard Law School alumnus President Barack Obama. In the race for U.S. Senate, like this time around, Romney ran on a platform of financial responsibility and reform—and it seems he had the same trouble convincing voters just what he believed.
"I'm not as well defined in people's minds," Romney said at the time. "It's harder for people to know my views."
Six years since first declaring his intentions to run for president and after a long and successful business career, no one can accuse Romney of being poorly trained this time around. The question is, can he outlast Obama up the final hill to election day?

With the presidential candidates all over our TV screens and newspapers in the final weeks before the election, it's easy to forget that they once got their humble beginnings here at Harvard.
Before the big fame hit, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama were already no strangers to The Crimson. As early as 1994, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School alum Romney was featured in a Crimson profile that shines some light on his current race. But even before then, Obama, another Law School alum, was already gracing the pages of The Crimson.
Beginning from his time as a student, all the way until he became President of the United States, let's take a trip through The Crimson's early coverage of Obama!
In Feb. 1990, Obama, then a Law School student, was elected the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. Following his (first) historic win, Obama called the victory "a significant change from the Harvard Law School of the past," adding that "for every one of me, there are a whole bunch of young Black people who, because of drugs, poverty, or whatever, aren't getting the opportunities I have." Even then, Obama hinted at his later ambitions, saying his future plans could range from running for political office to running public service programs. So modest.
As he prepared for post-graduate life in 1991, Obama tried his hand in another election—this time for a seat on Harvard's Board of Overseers, the University's second-highest governing body. Running as one of the three candidates for the Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid organization—an outsider group dedicated to divestment in South Africa—Obama and his fellow HRAAA candidates ultimately lost.
But Obama couldn't stay away for long! In 2006, Obama—now a Democratic senator from Ill.—was back in Boston to introduce Deval L. Patrick '78, then an outsider candidate for governor of Mass. In his speech, Obama avoided the H-bomb like a true Harvard alum. He said he "spent three years in a library in Boston, making sure I actually graduated from law school," and only later admitted that "library" was actually in Cambridge.
Ironically, Obama was there to endorse a candidate who would soon succeed the sitting governor, Romney. Though he finished his first term as governor of Mass., Romney did not seek reelection in the state in 2006 to instead focus on running for president in 2008—an election that Obama would ultimately win.

As midterm season began to heat up last week, a few Harvard students received a welcome dose of sympathy.
Writing to his Ethical Reasoning 18: "Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory" class last Thursday morning, Chinese history Professor Michael Puett apologized for the stressful, frenetic nature of midterms at the College and gave his students reason to cheer. "As a small gesture to help," he wrote, "…you will have no lectures, new reading assignments, or discussion sections next week" (i.e. this week).
That's right: although ER18 students do have a paper due this upcoming Friday, they'll have no other responsibilities in the course to distract them from reflecting on the teachings of China's greatest philosophers for their first major assignment of the term. Moreover, they'll have some more time to prepare for their other midterms.
Puett has consistently come in above the 4.0 mark on the Q-scale instructing ER18, with reviews such as 'Take this course!' and 'Professor Puett is the man!' After a move like this, he is sure to see his popularity rise.
If only all in the FAS were so kind…

If you haven't registered to vote in next month's general election, you have just two days to make sure you'll be able to head to the polls in Massachusetts.
The deadline to register to vote in Mass. is this Wednesday, Oct. 17, 20 days before Election Day. Students who are United States citizens living in Massachusetts while they attend college and have not already registered in another state may use their college addresses to register in Massachusetts.
Turbovote is a convenient option that allows you to register to vote online and will remind you of upcoming elections via text and email.
So register while there is still time. Make your voice heard!
