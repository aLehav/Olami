After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paranoid  and anxiety-prone individuals should not be permitted to live in  nuclear-obsessed, Cold War-era London with parents still smarting from  World War II bombing attacks. Such people should not be allowed to spend  copious amounts of time listening to radio reports on the inevitable  end of humanity, or have pacifist fathers and chronically depressed  mothers. That is simply a recipe for disaster. However, in the event  that a movie such as “Ginger & Rosa” prevails upon itself to depict  the previous catastrophic situation, Elle Fanning is, beyond a doubt,  the right actress to play the part. Fanning’s incredible acting saves  what is otherwise a heavy-handed and overly dramatic film.
Only  14 years old, Fanning plays a 17-year-old Ginger whose one mantra  throughout the film is, “The whole world could be blown to pieces any  minute.” In a kind of 1960s nihilism, Ginger goes about her life always  with the notion that everyone she knows could be dead tomorrow because  of the nuclear arms race between Europe, America, and the Soviet Union.  She frantically joins protest groups like “Campaign for Nuclear  Disarmament” and writes overly dramatic sonnets about the destruction of  the human race as her family life explodes into ruin. The camera spends  far too much time focused on Ginger’s face, but Fanning manages to make  the most out of the long close-ups; she bites her lip shyly or allows a  smile to burst across her face during her most serious moments, a  disarming break in emotion that draws attention to Ginger’s very young  age.
 
The  bare and incredibly confined plot does little for the momentum of the  story, but nevertheless the emotional climax of the movie succeeds  because of Fanning’s raw and childlike frustration. Choking through  tears but struggling to hold her own as an adult, Ginger confronts her  father and her best friend at the same time. Because of Fanning’s  understated yet ambitious portrayal of her character in the scenes  leading up to the climax—moments where Fanning breaks her character’s  attempt at maturity, or the tortured, uncertain nights Ginger spends  twisting her pillow in anguish—her collapse at the end of the movie is  deserved, and even superb.
 
But  director and writer Sally Potter’s script leaves much to be desired.  The fear Ginger projects about the possibility of nuclear war—can be  captured nicely in just the trailer. Aside from a rather nauseating  relationship between Ginger’s father Roland (Alessandro Nivola) and her  best friend Rosa (Alice Englert), the plot does not stray from the same  conflict and same cast of characters. The isolated storyline is  exhausting, and the experience is a bit like continuously pulling one  strand of hair after another from your scalp; it doesn’t feel like such a  serious action, but by the end you realize an entire patch of hair is  missing.
Provided,  Potter does make up for a lacking plot by nicely exploring themes of  confinement and pacifism. We are to assume that the reason Ginger and  her downtrodden mother (Christina Hendricks) do not stand up for  themselves and their emotional well-being is because Roland has trained  them both to be pacifists. And we are also supposed to assume that the  claustrophobic, confined feeling created by the limited scope and tiny  number of characters in the film stems from another of Roland’s sayings:  “There’s a sort of poetry in small spaces. Confinement can be  beautiful, but only if it’s by choice.” Imprisoned in his youth for  refusing to fight for his country in World War II, Roland is pitiable  and easily vilified for his treatment of his daughter and wife. Nivola  plays his Roland as both cold and charismatic; it was the script that  did not allow for much more depth that Nivola could have accessed. From  the beginning, Potter drops blatant hints that Roland was after Rosa,  and because of the lackluster script, Roland’s final monologue about  pacifism comes off forced and fake.
 
Ginger’s  mother Natalie is also woefully underdeveloped. In background, Natalie  has all the workings for a full, interesting character; she is a former  painter who had a child with a conscientious objector at the height of  the war. Instead of exploring the mother’s character, though, Potter  only catches the moments when Natalie whines for Roland to come home,  bitterly yells at Ginger to grow up, or commits a final act of  desperation at the end of the film. Hendricks had little opportunity to  share the gentler, saner parts of her character, just as Nivola was only  allowed to be ungenerous and self-centered on film.
 
In  such a stressed, confined environment, though, one aspect of the film  remains real and true: Ginger’s touching and complicated relationship  with Rosa, and their self-conscious, painful transformation into adults  leaves the movie with a not altogether unsavory taste. If nothing else,  Fanning and Englert have created a memorable representation of the  uncertainty and paranoia ubiquitous in the ‘60s, creating another  significant interpretation of a decade so oft-portrayed in film and  music.

I would bet that this academic year has been the Faust administration’s hardest to date.
Every university faces its share of critics. Harvard has had many in the past year, ranging from the nearly 200 faculty members who signed a petition decrying the University’s response to Occupy Harvard last year to the tens of thousands who called on Harvard not to appoint former Mexican President Felipe Calderon to a fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government earlier this semester. But although responses like these may put uncomfortable pressure on a university, none have rocked national news headlines and put quite so much public heat on the Faust administration as this year’s cheating scandal.
What made the cheating scandal a “scandal” instead of simply a routine university response to academic dishonesty? In part, the national media loves a story about Harvard, especially one that makes our famed university look bad. But I believe Harvard’s current administration may have fallen harder than it had to: The cheating scandal and the story of Harvard’s poor follow-up sharply cracked the façade of perfection that the Faust administration has been working hard to maintain. When all Harvard administrators speak with one voice, our university loses both the value of open discussion and the resilience of a community that welcomes internal dissent.
The 2012 Harvard cheating scandal began last spring when the instructor for Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” reported potential plagiarism to the Administrative Board, launching an investigation into potential collaboration between 125 students. The news that nearly two percent of Harvard’s undergraduate student body may have cheated on an exam quickly made its way into the national news, fed by a sports news audience interested to see how Harvard’s basketball team would fare once its two captains withdrew for the season.
More recently, Boston Globe correspondent Mary Carmichael broke the story that Harvard had secretly snooped through the emails of 16 resident deans to determine who had leaked a supposedly confidential email about the cheating investigation, sparking discussion within the Harvard community about privacy and trust as well as stories across the national press about administrative blundering.
Former Dean of Harvard College and current Director of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science Harry R. Lewis has been outspoken in his written and verbal critique of the administration’s handling of the cheating scandal. In his blog, Lewis has written extensively on the scandal in the past two semesters. He wrote in February, “What troubles me [is] why harsh penalties were meted out to more than a hundred students… when there were so many shades of gray in what students did and so much room for misinterpreting the course’s rules and policies.” More recently, Lewis argued that forwarding an email to students to clarify his or her academic status was “not an offense worth combing through email boxes.” However, his blog posts fall within a field of relative radio silence from Faust and other administrators.
Harvard’s last president, Larry H. Summers, was notoriously outspoken about his personal beliefs, decrying calls to divest from Israel as anti-semitic and vocalizing support for a theory of innate difference in aptitude across genders that eventually cost him his position as president. Faust’s administration seems to have learned from Summers’ blunders.
Indeed, Faust and every other dean or top administrator appear to speak with “one voice”—the official voice of Harvard. Student activists and Undergraduate Council members are frustrated by meetings with President Faust in which she fails to vocalize any opinions other than repeating already-published University position or policy. Faust’s administration relies on spokespeople to speak to the press and repeat to students and faculty only the official Harvard party line on controversial issues ranging from endowment investments to union contract negotiations to the cheating scandal to last year’s Yard lockdown. If any administrator supported the aims of the student protestors who occupied Harvard Yard last year (for example, I might have expected that Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, whose academic work on queer theory and black feminism informed the politics of many of us involved in Occupy, might have had a few sympathetic words for free speech and economic justice), neither students nor reporters heard a single peep. Hammonds, like all other administrators involved in addressing student protestors, simply repeated the University’s published statements on Yard access and safety.
It is because of this silence that Lewis’ dissent is so surprising.  Lewis, along with one or two important alumni, is nearly alone in vocally critiquing the administration’s handling of the cheating scandal. The University cannot forbid a current faculty member from expressive his critiques of Harvard’s performance, as it apparently has done with its current deans and administrators. Yet isn’t vigorous debate, respect for divergent viewpoints, and political controversy an integral part of a University community?
Certainly, some of former President Summers’s tactless statements were heartily embarrassing to Harvard and its other administrators. But Faust has gone too far the other direction. By presenting a uniform and unanimous face to the media and the University community, the Faust administration has harmed itself by constructing an image of infallible perfection, a carefully polished porcelain vase that is just too easy to knock to the ground and shatter. Our administration should learn from this year’s scandals that honesty and internal critique—like that of Harry R. Lewis—is valuable and indeed essential to a healthy university community.

Marriage may be joining the list of criminal offences, a list that includes acts such as rape, manslaughter and infanticide. But what kind of marriage classifies as a criminal offense? One in which a person is persuaded or threatened, against his or her will, to lock lives with a stranger. For many, the ring is a coveted symbol of love, but for some, it becomes a symbol of entrapment; an incessant reminder of events that elicited the forced “I do”.
Worldwide, an estimated 10 million girls under the age of 18 are pressured into early or forced marriages every year. While many associate the majority of these cases with poorer, developing countries, even in an ostensibly developed country such as the U.K., this number stands at around 8,000. Similarly, in the United States, forced marriage is a pressing problem, with as many as 3,000 cases, but unlike in the U.K., it is veiled from the eyes of the public. The United Kingdom’s approach may be worth adopting—the British have been taking action on what they believe should be viewed as an explicit criminal offense. Last year, however, England took a firm stance on forced marriages. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May began taking steps towards making forced marriage a criminal offence, with the new law expected to be introduced some time this year, during the 2013-14 parliamentary session. “I want to send a clear and strong message” Cameron stated. “Forced marriage is wrong, is illegal, and will not be tolerated.”
Before examining the necessary punitive action to bring forced marriage to end, it is important to make the distinction between arranged marriages and forced marriages. An arranged marriage does not violate any rights; it takes place with the consent of the individuals involved, and those who enter it have the option of withdrawing from the match at any time. A forced marriage, on the other hand, is one in which two people wed under psychological and/or physical pressure. It is this kind of marriage, in which the individual is under extreme duress, that Britain is rightfully attempting to prohibit.
Yet there are numerous concerns that surround criminalization of forced marriages. For instance, since forced marriages primarily occur within minority groups, a ban may be viewed as a cultural attack, not dissimilar to France’s ban on burqas. Yet the British, unlike the French, are placing a ban on a matter that inherently violates the right to free will. Forced marriage violates a universal right; Article 16 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights explains that “marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses."
Statistically, many forced marriages occur in the Muslim community. Yet the argument regarding the obstruction of religious practice also falls short, as no religion, and especially not Islam, advocates the union of two people against their will. In fact, the Qu’ran states, “O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion.”
However, apart from religious and cultural concerns, there exists an even more worrying issue: Opponents claim that criminalizing forced marriages would drive the issue further underground, as victims would be deterred from prosecuting their own parents. In order to avoid this consequence, Cameron has considered whether the ban would be more detrimental than effective. In order to prevent the silencing of victims, the existing civil solution is also expected to remain in place together with the new ban. Thus, victims who are unwilling to prosecute their parents may choose a civil protection route. Even if they choose to go the other way, victims will not be asked to support a prosecution against their will.
Apart from violating a right to liberty, a forced marriage almost always leads to another issue: non-consensual sexual activity. Some consider this another reason to not make forced marriage a criminal offense; the existing laws, which incriminate rape, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and harassment already cover the criminal acts that a forced marriage creates. However the legislature, concretely identifying the action as a criminal offense, could force parents to think twice before pressuring their sons and daughters into marrying against their will. It would certainly crystalize the issue as something that is not to be tolerated; it treats it as an unpardonable act in and of itself, separate from the issues it could generate.
Therefore, Cameron’s decision to illegalize forced marriages is a step other countries should consider following. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the northwest of the United Kingdom, believes the UK is around 10 years ahead of America (which not only has no Forced Marriage Units or hotlines, but also no federal law against the act) on the issue of forced marriage. While nine U.S. states and territories have legislature against forced marriage, there have been no prosecutions under it. Therefore, the outcome of the UK’s new legislation may prove useful in considering the management of the issue on American soil. If the United Kingdom’s legislation is successful, it could help transform the handcuff back into a ring. It could help minimize rape in favor of consensual sex. It could convert empty vows into sincere declarations. Ultimately, it is a step that could give back a voice to the young who utter the forced “I do.”

To the Editor:
The Catholic Church operates 1,137 hospitals, 5,375 dispensaries, and 1,285 orphanages on the continent of Africa. Catholic Relief Services, the Church’s international humanitarian agency, runs HIV and AIDS projects that serve eight million people in 62 countries around the world.  None of this is enough, however, for the liking of J. Gram Slattery ’15, the author of Wednesday’s opinion piece “The Illusion of Progress,” who writes, “No matter where the next pope comes from, the Church will still be complicit in the death and mistreatment of hundreds of thousands of AIDS victims and homosexuals throughout Africa.” The reason for this alleged complicity is that the Church, for all her ministry to the poor of Africa, does not permit the use of condoms.
The idea that the Church does not do enough for the poor in Africa is dubious at best. The idea that she is complicit in the deaths of hundreds of thousands is absolutely outrageous. Furthermore, the Church does not oppose the use of contraception out of some sort of doctrinaire rigidity that places loyalty to ancient teachings above real human needs. Rather, it is precisely this concern for the needs of real people that motivates the teaching. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI explained during his papacy that the Church does not distribute condoms in Africa because it does not believe that doing so will help solve the problem of HIV and AIDS.  Slattery ridicules this position as held only by the “irrational few,” but there is good reason to believe the pope was right. Edward C. Green, a senior researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health who believes philosophically that condoms should be available to all, once said, “The Pope may be right.  The marketing and distribution of condoms won’t solve the problem.”  When he said this a few years ago, Green wasn’t being irrational, ideological, or doctrinaire.  He simply looked at the data and found that the pope had a point.
Pope Francis begins his pontificate already widely recognized for his deep concern for the poorest of the poor; we can be certain that in the coming years the Church will continue serving those who are afflicted with HIV and AIDS. This aid will not include contraception, for out of its concern for the people it serves, the Church is not going to change her teaching on this matter. Some may disagree with her teaching on this matter, but regardless, the charge that she has blood on her hands is flagrantly unfair and unjust. The Church, as the largest private provider of care to HIV and AIDS patients in the world, deserves praise, not condemnation.

We write to congratulate the Harvard men’s basketball team for its first-ever NCAA conference win. Harvard rarely gets the chance to be the plucky underdog, but we certainly found ourselves in that role with our 14-seed team facing off against three-seed New Mexico. Furthermore, our team had come back from the graduation of two key players, the withdrawal of two more in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, and the mission trip departure of a fifth. But the team overcame these challenges and blew past expectations. We applaud their effort and cheer their victory.
We write not only to congratulate the team, but also to thank them. The team’s victory over New Mexico incited a great outpour of support and enthusiasm, even from a campus whose residents had departed on spring break adventures. Facebook and Twitter filled up with enthusiasm, uniting a far-flung student body around a single, distant game. Nor was the response limited to the virtual. Bars in New York City were filled with Harvard students who took to the streets when we won. Establishments in Harvard Square were utterly packed. Houses such as Currier held big-screen viewings of the games; these, too, were filled to capacity. It was a sight to see.
Harvard has many strengths, undergraduate spirit and cohesion is not among them. Sometimes, we are skeptical that a strong Harvard student community exists. This page has done its part to express that skepticism, from repeated exhortations for students to reach out to their peers, to the oft-heard criticism that the campus lacks social space. The basketball team’s victory was a welcome opportunity to see just how strong our community is. Even for an away game over spring break, Harvard students were drawn together, wherever they were. Athletics has a particular ability to transcend so many of the little boundaries that balkanize our campus culture. Regardless of whether we ourselves are athletes or academics, musicians or artists, activists or public servants, or all of these and more (for Harvard is a very busy place, sometimes), we were, for that game, united.
Like all such moments, of course, our NCAA run had to end. But despite Harvard’s defeat by Arizona, the school spirit our basketball team showed us lives on. We thank them for that, and look forward to next year, when we’re expecting even more amazing things from the team. We’re very fortunate to be on campus for Harvard’s first NCAA Tournament win, and we hope that basketball’s continued excellence will give us many more opportunities to celebrate their victories as a unified community in the years to come.

Dozens of students gathered in Sever Hall Monday night to hear education reformer Mike Feinberg tell the story of how he came to start the nation-wide network of charter schools known as the Knowledge is Power Program.
Starting the event with a thought experiment, Feinberg asked audience members to imagine a well-endowed private school and a large, under-resourced public school and to then consider what expectations society might have for the students attending each institution.
The charter school, Feinberg said, acts as a middle ground between these two, providing a high-quality education to children who may not have access to more elite private and public high schools.
“We have to separate two concepts: the concept of public education and the concept of how we deliver education to a community,” said Feinberg, who emphasized that providing a universally available education should not detract from providing an effective education.
“Charter schools are one more way to deliver education,” he said.
After spending three years teaching fifth-grade students in Houston through Teach for America, Feinberg founded his first KIPP school in that city. Feinberg said that during  his experience with TFA, he felt that his students lacked the adequate academic setting to grow intellectually—something he hoped to provide with his new charter school.
Monday’s lecture, which was presented by the Harvard College Education Society, was attended by Harvard students who said they came to learn more about the type of education reform championed by KIPP.
“I’ve heard a lot about the benefits and drawbacks of KIPP,” said attendee Bernadette N. Lim ’16. “This event demystified a lot of that for me.”
Others who attended the event said it was an opportunity for them to further their interests in urban education reform.
“I came to this talk to because I thought it would complement my spring break service trip, where we looked at urban education and policy reform in Washington, D.C.” said attendee Tianhao He ’15, who participated in PBHA’s alternative spring break program.
Feinberg, who has received various honors for his work, including an honorary degree from Yale University and the Presidential Citizen’s Medal, believes the premise of KIPP is simple.
“There are no shortcuts,” he said.
Feinberg concluded his talk with another thought experiment, asking the audience to decide which of two classrooms they would send their children to: one with cutting-edge technology and equipment or a classroom without the glitzy gadgets but with a phenomenal teacher.
“We often forget as a group the most important resource of all—the human resource,” said Feinberg.

A Congressional budgetary amendment severely limiting National Science Foundation funding for political science research poses a significant threat to that field’s most promising academic work, Harvard government professors warned Monday.
Just as important, professors argued, these cuts set a dangerous precedent for direct legislative intervention in the administration of federal research dollars.
“For basic, high-quality, foundation political science research—the NSF is by far the most important funder,” said government professor Robert D. Putnam, a former NSF grant recipient. “I think most people understand that this is really dumb.”
The amendment prohibits all NSF funding of political science research “except for projects that the Director of the National Science Foundation certifies as promoting national security or the economic interests of the United States.” The amendment was added to a long-sought budget deal designed to fund the government through the end of the 2013 fiscal year.
The $984 billion deal passed in the Senate by a vote of 73 to 26 last Wednesday and passed in the House of Representatives by a 318-109 vote on Thursday.
Senator Tom Coburn, who sponsored the amendment, wrote in a letter to outgoing NSF Director Subra Suresh that the Foundation needed to “do more with less” and reconsider projects that are not likely to lead to “truly meaningful discoveries or knowledge,” as it faces a five percent sequester to its budget for the current fiscal year.
“Studies of presidential executive power and Americans' attitudes toward the Senate filibuster hold little promise to save an American's life from a threatening condition or to advance America's competitiveness in the world," Coburn wrote.
It is unclear how exactly the amendment will affect Harvard and its researchers, who are already facing the implications of across-the-board funding cuts enacted earlier this month. The Office for Sponsored Programs reported that the Kennedy School received nearly $1 million from the NSF in the 2012 fiscal year—a figure that represents 18.3 percent of the Kennedy School’s federally sponsored funding. Government Department figures were not immediately available.
Regardless of the exact financial impact, professors said that the targeted cuts to political science are troubling in principle.
“Given the current dysfunctions of US government, surely we need more knowledge about politics, government, and governance now not less. In contrast, this amendment—not yet law—represents a vote for darkness over light, a triumph of ideological certainty uninformed by evidence,” David M. J. Lazer, director of the NSF-sponsored Program on Networked Governance at the Kennedy School, wrote on his blog last week.
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol said the cuts will likely affect certain programs more than others, particularly large ongoing data collection projects. Though the figures are not huge, she added, they are big enough to have an impact on important work.
“I think the real issue here is not this particular voice vote, which may be reversed, but the principal of Congress delving into the NSF budget to prohibit subcategories of research—that's terrible,” Skocpol said.
The amendment has caught the attention of the Association of American Universities, a consortium of 62 universities, including Harvard, that works to reinforce the relationship between educational institutions and government.
Barry Toiv, the vice president for public affairs of the AAU, said that the targeting of a specific field of research for cuts sets a dangerous precedent for the government’s involvement in science and creates a “slippery slope” for further research cuts. 
“It’s a way of cutting research, and at the same time being able to say, ‘I don’t really want to cut ‘serious’ research,’” he said. “It means that Congress is arbitrarily picking winners and losers, and that’s the last thing we need.”
Congress still needs to come to terms on a budget for the 2014 fiscal year. That debate will likely continue into April.

Astronaut Stephanie D. Wilson ’88 will serve as Harvard’s chief marshal and lead her fellow alumni into Harvard Yard for Commencement 2013, the Harvard Alumni Association announced in a press release Tuesday.
Wilson, who flew three missions on the space shuttle Discovery and is the second African American woman to travel into space, was elected by her classmates—this year’s 25th reunion class—to perform various Commencement duties as a member of the HAA’s Happy Observance of Commencement Committee, also known as The Happy Committee.
“I am very humbled to have been selected among such accomplished and talented candidates,” Wilson said in the press release. “In an era where inspiring and educating the next generation is crucial, Harvard provides unique opportunities to excel in any chosen field. I look forward to serving as chief marshal for the 2013 Harvard Commencement and to ushering the next generation of leaders into the world.”
Wilson’s election as chief marshal is not the first recognition she has received for her engineering career or for her involvement with Harvard. A member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers—the University’s second highest governing body—since 2007, Wilson received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal twice and the Space Flight Medal three times, as well as the Harvard Foundation Scientist of the Year Award in 2008.
HAA President Carl F. Muller ’73 said in the press release that Wilson’s career is demonstrative of the potential of a Harvard College education.
“This answers the question, ‘What does one do with a liberal arts education?’ Literally and figuratively, fly to the moon,” Muller said. “Perhaps astronaut Wilson will start a Harvard Club in outer space.”
The University’s 2013 Commencement activities—Harvard’s 362nd—will take place on May 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department announced this week it would modify its month-old Twitter strategy to share specific locations of reported crimes in progress, adjusting the program to avoid tweets unclear about where crimes are taking place. The department’s emphasis on Twitter, which aims to provide real-time information to the public, drew criticism for providing vague information to the public, causing unnecessary fear.
CPD began releasing automated Tweets containing dispatcher reports of potential crimes in progress at the end of February. CPD’s Tweets, which can be found on the Twitter profile @CambridgePolice, will now provide specific address information down to the 100 block of the location involved.
“When we launched the program, we were only giving street names for the location,” CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello said. “We got a lot of feedback, and some people said that the information would be more useful if there was more specific information so they would no where to avoid.”
“This is very similar to what the Seattle Police do,” Riviello added, referring to the department that launched one of law enforcement’s first major entries into the Twitterverse last summer. Since CPD launched the program, their presence on Twitter has increased around 30 percent.
Now a typical tweet will share a brief description of the potential crime and include a general location, such as 2XX Massachusetts Avenue, according to a CPD press release. Tweets will continue to carry the hashtag #CambMa.
Some Cantabrigians say there are still problems with the CPD’s new strategy. Jeremy Rothman-Shore, a Cambridge resident who criticized CPD’s crime-reporting tweets shortly after the new program launched, told The Crimson last month that the initiative may do more harm than good.
“They say that if they make one person safer with this program, they’ve done a good job. But if they make 100 people scared to go outside with this program, then I’d say its not really helpful,” Rothman-Shore said of the original program.
Riviello said the initiative's increased communication with the public is a good thing.
“Whether or not we’re tweeting these incidents, they’re still occurring,” he told The Crimson on Monday. “It’s just like a police scanner that people have had for years, and that you can now monitor on the internet. We’re just trying to communicate more information.”
Despite criticism, CPD’s new tweets have gained the department not only some national recognition, but also more than 1,500 new Twitter followers.
Additionally, other police departments have expressed their interest in adopting the system. Riviello said that the Cambridge authorities have even shared some of the code that generates the automated tweets with other departments.
“We were happy to see that we’ve gained a very large number of followers since we launched this, which proves to us that people are interested in this and that there is value to it,” Riviello said.
“It’s great, because it means we’re reaching more people,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Over 75 students stuffed, sewed, and decorated miniature Hepatitis B viral plushies during a study break Monday evening to kick off Hepatitis B Awareness Week.
During the study break, which was sponsored by the student organization Team HBV Harvard, students snacked on Insomnia cookies and J.P. Licks ice cream while perusing educational material aimed at raising awareness about the liver disease.
“Six-hundred thousand people die every year as a result of Hepatitis B's consequences,” said Shirley Mo ’16, Team HBV Harvard’s outreach coordinator. “Despite its huge global prevalence, Hepatitis B is, tragically, a hugely misunderstood and underrepresented disease.”
Hepatitis B Awareness Week features daily events through Friday, including a daily HBV prize wheel outside the Science Center, a Friday night soiree, and a discussion with public health professor and Adams House master John G. “Sean” Palfrey '67 on HBV vaccination efforts in the United States.
Chloe S. Kurzon '15, who heard about Monday’s study break over a House email list, said that before the event she had had no idea how prevalent the virus was in the United States.
“They did a great job of making learning about HBV fun,” said Kurzon, who added that she enjoyed discovering new facts during each stage in the plushie-making process. “I learned something new at each station.”
The Hepatitis B virus causes inflammation of the liver and, according to Mo, disproportionately affects Asians. Over 240 million people worldwide are infected with chronic Hepatitis B, which can be fatal.
Monday’s study break drew support from several Asian student groups, including the Harvard Taiwanese Cultural Society, the Harvard Korean Association, the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Student Association, and the Harvard Hong Kong Society.
Jennifer S. Chen '15, one of the event ‘s organizers, said that as part of its outreach efforts, Team HBV is in talks with Harvard University Health Services to create a streamlined screening service for at-risk students.
“One in ten Asians are affected, whereas only one in 1,000 Caucasians suffer from HBV,” said Chen. “We want to make sure HUHS is effectively screening students.”
Ingrid A. Hartman '13 said she came  to the study break with limited knowledge of the virus but left with both newfound information and practical skills.
“I had no idea it affected more Asian people than in the general population,” she said. “Plus, I learned how to sew a button!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Quincy students living in Hampden Hall swing space were forced out of their rooms and into the suites of friends and House mates Monday night, as a power outage that began early in the evening kept a cluster of buildings along Plympton Street and Massachusetts Avenue in the dark.
The outage occurred when a power circuit faulted under Harvard Square just after 5 p.m., according to employees of NSTAR, the power company that services the city of Cambridge.
When it became clear that power would not be restored in time for residents to return to the building Monday night, College officials, including Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison and Associate Dean of Student Life Kimberly A. Pacelli, gathered in the Quincy Senior Common Room around 11:30 p.m. to organize temporary housing for residents of Hampden Hall. The dorm, one of three buildings designated as swing space during Harvard’s ongoing House renewal project, is located at 8 Plympton St.
“We’ve heard all night that it’s going to be one hour, one hour, one hour,” Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke said.
As administrators sought outside shelter for affected students, blockmates and friends scrambled to arrange less formal accommodations, offering couches and spare beds to the roomless Quincy residents.
“We’ve got lots of people just saying we’ve got room,” Gehrke said of the residents of New Quincy. “Most people have actually found places to stay. We’re looking now at where there are empty beds that are residential beds like in Lowell or Quincy and DeWolfe.”
By 1 a.m., administrators said they had found space for all Hampden residents in the Houses.
Late Monday night, Harvard security had begun to guard entrances to Hampden, allowing access to residents who needed to retrieve medical necessities, only when accompanied by College officials.
Hampden was not the only building affected, as adjacent buildings, including a handful of Harvard Square businesses and the offices of The Crimson at 14 Plympton Street, plunged into darkness. With the newsroom darkened and the presses at a standstill, production of Tuesday's Crimson shifted next door to the Adams House dining hall, where a skeleton staff worked past 2 a.m. to edit and design the paper. Turley Publications, Inc. of Palmer, Mass., printed Tuesday’s paper.
Lindsey V. Aakre, a tutor in Hampden, was in the building when the power first went out and said that she was initially told power would be restored by 8 p.m.
“Eventually, they stopped predicting,” she said. “I took some stuff with me, but clearly not enough now.”
Hampden resident Ji Su Yoo ’15 said she is staying the night with a friend in Quincy, and is not sure when she will get back into her room.
“They weren’t very specific at all about when tomorrow,” she said.
Once the power is restored to the building, students will still have to wait for the fire department to verify that the alarms are operational before residents are able to return unescorted.
The highly localized outage is not the first to affect the area this school year. In November, a tripped NSTAR transformer plunged much of the Square and River Houses into darkness for two hours.

Harvard College will raise its financial aid budget by nearly 6 percent for the 2013-2014 school year, the University announced in a press release Tuesday. At the same time, the total cost of attendance for undergraduates will increase by 3.5 percent to $56,407 for the coming academic year.
The $10 million increase in the financial aid budget will push the total aid provided by the College to a record sum of $182 million.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in the press release that the administration remains committed to making the College accessible to students of all socioeconomic backgrounds, despite stagnant endowment returns and the threat of research funding cuts in recent years.
“Our message is simple,” Smith said. “Getting admitted to Harvard College is difficult. Affording Harvard College shouldn’t be. By enabling us to attract the best and the brightest to Harvard from all backgrounds, our financial aid program strengthens the experiences of all our students, including those not receiving support.”
Smith said that the bump in financial aid can be attributed to the “enormous generosity of our committed alumni” and the intergenerational relationship between alumni and students.
In 2004, the University launched the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative to increase aid for students from lower and middle-class families. Starting in 2006, parents of students from families with incomes below $60,000 were no longer expected to contribute to the student’s cost of attendance, and beginning with the 2012-2013 academic year, the threshold that was increased to $65,000.
Under current policies effective beginning for students in the Class of 2016, families with incomes that amount to $150,000 or less pay roughly zero to 10 percent of their incomes.
More than 60 percent of undergraduates receive need-based aid, and approximately 20 percent of families do not need to contribute to their child’s cost of attendance at all.

CORRECTION: March 28, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard's financial aid policy allowing families to pay roughly zero to 10 percent of their incomes applies to families with assets and incomes of $150,000 or less. In fact, the policy applies to families whose incomes are below that threshold.
CLARIFICATION: March 28, 2013
 An earlier version of this article stated that Harvard currently has a financial aid policy permitting families making $150,000 or less to pay roughly zero to 10 percent of their incomes. To clarify, that policy applies beginning for students in the Class of 2016.

Harvard has decided to extend the Harvard Allston Parternship Fund, an organization that gives grants to non-profits in the Brighton-Allston community, by allocating $500,000 in new funds and granting its support for another five years to supplement the existing program.
The fund was founded five years ago as a partnership with the Boston Redevelopment Authority. Since then, HAPF has infused approximately $100,000 per year into about 20 local nonprofits chosen by a panel of representatives from Allston, the Boston Mayoral office, and the BRA.
“Over the past five years, the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund program has worked to improve quality of life for thousands of Allston-Brighton residents,” Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino told the Harvard Gazette. “I’m pleased that Harvard has recommitted to the partnership for another five years, and will continue to serve our residents through this important work.”
By 2018, Harvard will have invested about a million dollars into the Allston community through HAPF.
Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Christine Heenan called the Fund “a unique partnership between Harvard, the city of Boston, and our Allston neighbors, and an example of how we can work together to achieve our shared goal for a thriving Allston community.”
“We are pleased to support the excellent work of many Allston-Brighton nonprofits that work tirelessly to better the lives of our Allston neighbors and enrich our community,” Heenan told the Gazette.
HAPF funds nonprofits such as the Gardner Pilot Academy, the Honan Allston Library, and the Vocational Advancement Center, that strive for cultural and educational enrichment and neighborhood improvement. In the past, grants have ranged in size between $4,500 and $25,000.
According to a University press release, the funds allocated by HAPF have allowed these organizations to widen their breath to reach about 3,500 more members of the Allston-Brighton community.
“With Harvard's support and under diligence and guidance of Inez Foster, the program’s administrator, we’ve enabled hundreds, if not thousands, of dreams to come true," John Bruno, a member of the HAPF advisory board and the Harvard Allston Task Force, told the Gazette.
“I’m proud to be part of an effort that has had such a widespread impact on people in our community who needed it most,” he added.

Students no longer need to venture off campus to satisfy cravings for some of their favorite baked goods.
Harvard University Dining Services has partnered with Cambridge staple Petsi Pies and recent Allston arrival Swiss Bakers to offer products from these local bakeries in all their retail locations, including the Greenhouse Café.
“Petsi and Swissbakers are independent businesses and they sell to us—as they do to other retailers –at a set wholesale price,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
HUDS submits orders to the bakeries in advance, and the items are delivered fresh each morning.
According to Martin, the response to the initiative has been overwhelmingly positive, as customers continue to enjoy the new options and recognize the high quality of the bakeries.
These partnerships are part of the larger HUDS green initiative.
“As part of our overall sustainability program, we routinely partner with local companies such as these to share their popular products with our customers,” she wrote.
Martin added that an integral facet of the HUDS mission involves featuring local products.
“Whenever possible, we buy locally, which is both an investment in the New England economy and an effort to reduce the environmental impact of transportation of goods,” she wrote.
Thomas Stohr, co-owner of Swiss Bakers, said he was excited at the opportunity to partner with HUDS, which was extended through a request from John M. Aiken, Procurement Manager for HUDS and an active proponent of the sustainability program and of local farmers and businesses.
“We have great supporters in the Harvard community,” Stohr said.  “We share the same values of healthy, fresh food.”
Harvard similarly approached Petsi Pies with an interest in selling their products, according to Petsi Pies business administrator Talbot Penniman, who credited Petsi’s local reputation with attracting the attention of HUDS.
The University began selling Petsi Pies products this past fall and added Swiss Baker items this month.
“Petsi and Swissbakers are local and well respected bakers who also do this kind of wholesale business to expand their market,” wrote Martin. “We're lucky to feature their great - and yummy - work!”

If there ever was a model Harvard journalist, his name was J. Anthony Lewis ’48. Starting in 1946—when he helped relaunch The Crimson as a daily after World War II—through  a long career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning legal correspondent and columnist for the New York Times, until his death Monday at the age of 85, Lewis helped steer modern liberal journalism through his pioneering coverage of the Supreme Court and coached some of The Crimson’s brightest stars.
“You’re certainly the product of your experiences [and] it was The Crimson that shaped me,” Lewis told The Crimson in 1997, when he was chosen as Class Day speaker at Harvard Law School.
But even as The Crimson shaped Lewis, he, in turn, shaped the organization. Over decades as an active member of the paper’s graduate board and one of its three trustees, he was the champion of quality journalism and the model for every young Crimson editor that hoped one day to make it in the world of print.
“You were in a situation where everyone’s parents were begging them not to go into journalism, and you wanted to have some visible role model,” said Nicholas B. Lemann ’76, the dean of Columbia University School of Journalism. “A lot of his influence was just modeling for us what a happy and an honored career in journalism could look like, and it looked pretty good.”
After graduation, Lewis remained a close advisor to Crimson managing editors, making a point to get to know each one and offering advice about the position and their own future—even while he was working at the Washington Daily News and, later, the Times.
George Abrams ’54 first met Lewis while serving as editor of the paper in 1953. The two would serve together as Crimson trustees decades later, playing a part in fundraising and reconstruction of the paper’s Plympton Street building.
According to Abrams, Lewis loved keeping track of how many Crimson editors ended up in staff at the Times, even though he recognized that not everyone would land there.
“If you’re looking for some life pattern that will lead every Crimson editor to become a columnist for The New York Times, you will fail; you will strike out,” Lewis said in a 1981 Crimson interview.
Still, Lewis influenced a generation of Crimson journalists, who went on to award-winning careers, including the likes of Lemann, David L. Halberstam ’55, J. Anthony Lukas ’55, Hendrik Hetzberg ’65, and James Fallows ’70, among others.
One of these journalists, Linda Greenhouse ’68, followed Lewis’s footsteps directly to the foot of the Supreme Court, where she would serve as the Times chief correspondent for 30 years.
A Pulitzer-winner herself, Greenhouse said she is still trying to live up to the standard for legal reporting set by Lewis.
“Journalistically, before he came along, the Supreme Court was an oracle that occasionally and rather randomly issued important decisions,” Greenhouse wrote in an email. “He saw the Court as a full participant in the political life of the country, and approached it as such, in full context and with great nuance.”
Lewis’s reporting on the Court earned him his second of two Pulitzers by the time he was in his mid-30s. He had won his first at the Washington Daily News for coverage of the Navy’s firing of a civilian employee deemed a security risk.
Though Lewis only reported on the Court for a little under a decade and never earned a law degree, many considered him to be one of the nation’s foremost legal experts.
Lewis’s non-newspaper writing was widely influential as well. His most famous book, Gideon’s Trumpet, won broad acclaim from justices and court observers.
After his stint in Washington, Lewis served as London Bureau Chief for the Times from 1964-1969, and then as an op-ed columnist until his retirement in 2001. His twice-weekly column, titled “Abroad at Home/At Home Abroad,” was a staple among Democratic readers.
“At a liberal moment in American history, he was one of the defining liberal voices,” Lemann said.
Lewis married Massachusetts lawyer Margaret Marshall in 1984. Marshall, who was his second wife, went on to become the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
Though he moved back to Boston while he was a columnist, Lewis co-taught a graduate course on the First Amendment and the Supreme Court at Columbia for 23 years.
Vincent Blasi, a Columbia Law Professor who co-taught the First Amendment Course, called Lewis an “original thinker” in the field, with an unusual teaching ability.
“He was striking in how much respect he had for the thought processes of other people. He never, with students or with me, played the role of the famous person or the original thinker,” Blasi said.
Paul Sack ’48, a former Crimson business editor who was friends with Lewis for more than 70 years, said he was a natural journalist and a charismatic presence throughout his life.
“Tony was a wonderful person and people were willing to work very hard to do things for him, just because of some sheer magnetism of his personality,” Sack said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy weekend for Harvard’s co-ed sailing team this weekend, as the squad was split for two different regattas on the East Coast.
The Crimson paired with MIT to host the 84th Boston Dinghy Club Challenge Cup on the Charles on Saturday and Sunday, while some members of the Harvard team traveled further south to compete in the 73rd Owen, Mosbacher & Knapp Trophy, which was hosted by Navy. The Crimson came in seventh place in both regattas.
“We entered the weekend with some trepidation because we hadn't done well the weekend before,” Harvard coach Michael O’Connor said.
After the weekend, the Crimson sits ranked as No. 15 for co-ed collegiate sailing and remains unranked in the women’s division.
84th BOSTON DINGHY CLUB CHALLENGE CUP
Harvard claimed seventh place out of the 17 teams racing at the 84th Boston Dinghy Club Challenge Cup, while Boston College, MIT and Brown took the top three spots, respectively.
The first day of competition opened Saturday with gusts of wind coming in as high as 30 knots. Several capsizes occurred in the 12 races, as the sailors tried maneuvering the course as best as they could in fireflies, the type of boat sailing in the majority of the races.
O’Connor selected sophomore Brian Drumm and freshman Jacob Bradt to compete in what he classified as a very competitive A-division. The duo took 8th place with 149 points.
“We struggled a little bit early on with the firefly, which, at least in my boat, we weren’t too familiar with,” Bradt said. “We struggled with that, especially with the windy conditions.”
The Crimson took fifth place in the next two divisions with 115 points from sophomore Michael Drumm and junior Luke O'Connor in B division on Saturday and 108 points from freshman Marek Zaleski and junior Isabel Ruane on Sunday.
“[Drumm] teamed up with heavy air specialist, Luke O'Connor, for some great results in the big breeze on Saturday,” O’Connor said.
The squad also participated in races with FJs at the regatta.
“Once we rotated [to] boats we were more comfortable with, even with the more heavy wind conditions, we felt like we were hanging with a lot of competitive boats and some really good teams,” Bradt said.
Sunshine came through on Sunday for the last five races and winds were kept under 10 knots. Harvard finished off with 372 points, 64 points less than Ivy rival Yale.
73rd OWEN, MOSBACHER & KNAPP TROPHY
Competing in one less division than the regatta up north, the Crimson finished in seventh place out of 19 teams that raced on Maryland’s Severn River.
The first day of competition featured favorable sailing conditions, as 12 races were conducted in almost a full day of sunshine and the winds around 12 knots. Luck ran out by Sunday for the sailors, however, as grey skies and unpleasant conditions required the racers to be relocated to the Annapolis Harbor, where five more races got in before the day was called for sailing.
With a total of 165 points, Yale took first place. Connecticut College and St. Mary’s of Maryland followed right behind with 210 and 233, respectively.
Harvard finished out the weekend with 275 points. In Division A, sophomore Gram Slattery and senior Jinyan Zang took 10th place with 165 points. In Division B, the freshmen duo of Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky ranked third with 110 points, behind the Bulldogs and Camels.
“This weekend, we showed a lot of improvement from where we were earlier this spring season, [and] definitely from where we were at the beginning and even the end of last fall,” Bradt said.
The Crimson spent the beginning of spring break in mid-Atlantic waters training for the rest of the season in warmer conditions.
“We were really just working on fundamentals,” Bradt said. “[The training] gave us the opportunity to isolate things that each particular boat had to work on and it gave us a lot more time to focus on individual things which we can improve on.”
Despite expressing his happiness with how the team performed over the weekend, Bradt believes there is still more that can be worked on in regard to the squad’s mental preparation and outlook.
“One of the big things about college sailing, especially at the higher level, is having the correct mindset and intensity,” he said. “I think we need to show a little bit more maturity in that regard, but that’s something that we showed some improvement on this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were moments during the Harvard men’s basketball team’s tilt against third-seeded New Mexico in which the Lobos appeared poised to do what 94.4 percent of ESPN Tournament Challenge brackets predicted—take over its second-round contest and defeat the Crimson. But each time, Harvard, and in particular co-captain Laurent Rivard, had an answer.
The junior sharpshooter connected on five-of-nine shots from long range Thursday evening, contributing 17 points as the Crimson earned its first NCAA Tournament victory in program history, 68-62, at EnergySolutions Arena.
Rivard’s five timely three-pointers bolstered his season total to 79—a new program record—and helped the 14-seed Crimson to its first-ever victory over a top-10 team.
“Sure, it's a cool thing,” said Rivard after the game when asked about his record. “But, you know, what's sweeter is winning as a team and advancing in the NCAA Tournament.”
According to his teammates, Rivard’s impressive performance on college basketball’s biggest stage was far from surprising.
“Honestly, whenever I go to the gym, I always see Laurent in there,” said sophomore Wesley Saunders, who led the Crimson with 18 points against the Lobos, one day after the win. “He's the first one in there, the last one to leave, always getting shots up. It's not really a mystery why he's such a great shooter.”
“[Rivard’s] work ethic is tremendous,” co-captain Christian Webster added. “He puts a lot into it, that's why he gets so much out of it."
After hitting three long-range shots in the first half of his team’s game against New Mexico, Rivard made what may have been his biggest shot of the day with 6:16 to play. Down by one point less than a minute after two Rivard free throws regained the lead for Harvard, the junior’s ensuing triple ushered in a 7-0 run that gave the Crimson an advantage, 59-53, it would hold for the remainder of the contest.
Back-to-back threes from Webster and Rivard had also captured the lead for the Crimson and secured a four-point advantage, 37-33, earlier on in the half.
“It was huge,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker after the game, describing his two co-captains’ shooting prowess against the Lobos. “That's a big weapon for us to be able to hit a few shots and gain some confidence.  Not only for our team but for those kids individually, as well.  We need to have balance, we need a way of going inside and out, not just in the post but driving it in there.”
Rivard knocked down his first trey of the game with 13:56 to play in the opening frame, pushing Harvard to a 7-2 advantage after a jumper from the Lobos’ Alex Kirk cut the Crimson’s initial lead to two. Before the first 10 minutes of the game had elapsed, Rivard added a steal and two defensive rebounds to his three early points.
And after a free throw from Cameron Bairstow once again made it a one-possession game, 13-10, Rivard found the bottom of the net for the second time at 8:08.
Kirk tied up the game at 18 with a little more than five to go in the half. But freshman point guard Siyani Chambers found Rivard behind the arc, and the junior nailed his third look from long range, giving Harvard an advantage it would keep going into the break.
Rivard finished the contest against New Mexico with a pair of steals and five defensive boards, as the Crimson became the then-lowest seed and second-lowest overall to advance to the Round of 32.
“[Rivard] is guarding players that are bigger than us,” Amaker said after the second-round game. “For him to stick his nose in there and to be tough around the basket, it says something about how scrappy and how tough he can become when we need that against bigger players inside.”
 
It wasn’t the first time that Rivard had come up big for the Crimson when it mattered most.
 
In Harvard’s NCAA Tournament game last year, the junior tallied 20 points on six-of-seven shooting against No. 5-seeded Vanderbilt, though the Crimson eventually suffered a 79-70 loss.
More recently, Rivard led the Crimson with 17 in a victory over Cornell, 65-56, to seal at least a share of the Ivy League title on Mar. 9—Harvard would claim the outright crown less than an hour later thanks to a Princeton loss to Brown.
After a stellar game on Thursday, Rivard added just one more three before the clock struck midnight on Harvard’s Cinderella story, scoring three points on one-of-six shooting in the 74-51 loss to Arizona Saturday night. The effort pushed his season total to 80 made treys. Harvard—which shot 52.4 percent against the Lobos—came out ice cold against the Wildcats, missing its first 13 shots from the field.
Rivard’s triple narrowed the Arizona lead to 56-39 with just over 10 minutes to go in Harvard’s season. But the Crimson would not pull closer than a 14-point deficit less than three minutes into the final frame.
Still, the weekend marks Harvard’s most successful all-time in NCAA Tournament play.
“It's a dream we have had since we were little kids,” Rivard said after the win on Thursday. “To do it with Harvard on our chest, can't get better than that.”
