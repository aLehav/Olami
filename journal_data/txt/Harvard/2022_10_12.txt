After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout Iran, calls of “Jin, Jiyan, Azadi” or “Zan, Zendegi, Azadi” ring not only in the streets but in the halls of schools and universities. Instead of echoing these calls for “Woman, Life, Freedom,” Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow has remained silent in the face of student demands for an expression of solidarity. This is a serious dereliction of his duty and the duty of the Harvard community more broadly to shed light on the atrocities at Sharif University of Technology and express support for the past few weeks of civil resistance in Iran — in other words, to pursue justice and Veritas.
Iranian women are leading an intersectional movement for change that has been met with brutality and further oppression by the regime. Recently, Iranian armed forces raided Sharif University in Tehran, assaulting and arresting dozens of students and faculty members whose conditions and whereabouts remain unknown. Sharif University has captured greater media attention due to its distinguished status, but similar modes of repression are enacted across many schools in the country of over 80 million people.
These protests began following the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Jina (Mahsa) Amini while in the custody of the “morality police'' for what they deemed improper head-covering. Jina’s death served as the catalyst for the largest mobilization against the regime since 2009, when millions took to the streets to protest alleged election rigging. The civil demonstrations have been met with brutality and repression by the regime, including internet blackouts, mass arrests, and the killing of hundreds of people. As protestors continue to be silenced, the need for prominent members of the international community to amplify Iranian voices grows even more dire.
As members of the Harvard community from Iran or the Iranian diaspora, we write to mark the deafening silence on our campus. Students, the very souls of higher education institutions, are being targeted. These violations are closer to Harvard than many realize. There are numerous members of the Iranian community at Harvard — your neighbors, classmates, friends, and teachers. The University numbers former students of Sharif and other Iranian universities among its affiliates. Multiple Iranian Harvard affiliates wanted to join us in authoring this op-ed but could not put it to their name for fear of retribution by the regime, including losing their ability to travel to Iran.
As hurting but hopeful Iranians at Harvard, we need your voice to join in support of this fight for freedom. We in the Harvard community have an obligation to use our privilege and capacity to advocate for our fellow students and all Iranians struggling for justice.
One need not look further than Harvard’s motto, “Veritas,” to understand that this institution is premised on a commitment to the truth. We ask for your solidarity not simply because the victims are Iranian or affiliated with prestigious institutions of higher education but because they are students, just like us, seeking knowledge and truth. Academic institutions like ours must stand together at the forefront of the struggle for truth and intellectual integrity, and that cannot be interrupted by borders or nationalities. Several universities have already released statements in solidarity with Iranians. Harvard’s comparative silence is stark.
A statement from President Bacow would go a long way. This is exemplified by the case of Shervin Hajipour — an Iranian singer arrested for his song, “Baraye” (For), which has reached millions of views and is regarded by many as the anthem of this movement. After international outcry Hajipour was released on bail. Hajipour’s case remains the exception rather than the rule, however, as the Iranian regime continues to crack down on activists, many of whom we cannot honor with our attention because their names are unknown.
As we strive to speak out in support of students standing against injustice, intolerance, and brutality in Iran, we emphasize the need to aspire in the same measure to the liberation of populations suffering from oppression elsewhere. What is happening in Iran is an intersectional movement that concerns all of us — one part of a larger struggle against institutionalized oppression. We condemn the human rights atrocities of every state that perpetuates cycles of injustice towards communities of all kinds, including students and activists.
Recognizing state oppression globally, we also stand firm against reckless interventionist policies, like that of the 1953 U.S. coup of Iran’s democratically-elected leader, Mohammad Mossadegh. It is of utmost importance that we carefully listen to the needs of Iranians, avoiding further harm to those whom we need to empower through supportive action.
President Bacow, you have the opportunity to empower, but your silence as the leader of a world-renowned institution is complicity. This can still change. An official statement of support would go a long way as a meaningful expression of solidarity with your students and the people of Iran risking their lives for freedom.
It is not too late to say “Woman, Life, Freedom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You start by giving children a choice: “What do you want now, pretzels or water?” Most choose pretzels, so you give them pretzels to eat. Then, ask again: pretzels or water? Unsurprisingly, many choose water. At this point, you ask them what they’ll want tomorrow.
“Presumably they're not going to be thirsty anymore, and so they should revert to their preferred option, which is the pretzels,” said Cristina Atance, a professor of psychology and Director of the Childhood Cognition and Learning Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. (She conducted the study and was kind enough to tell me about it over Zoom.)
But overwhelmingly, the kids in Atance’s study said they would want water. It was difficult for them to separate their future selves from feeling thirsty in the moment.
Fascinating. But that’s just children, and children lack patience, right?
Well, yes and no — while adults have more knowledge and experience and better behavioral control than children, all humans are notoriously lousy at setting aside current mental states and biases when thinking about the future. We are terrible at predicting our future emotions, no good at imagining our future preferences, and very bad at forecasting our future values, personalities, and trajectories.
One study by Harvard Professor of Psychology Dan Gilbert asked nearly 20,000 young, middle-aged, and older people how much they changed in the past 10 years and how much they expected to change in the following 10. The results showed that at every age, people believed that they had changed significantly in the past but would change fairly little in the future. Twenty-year-olds, for example, predicted that they would change less than 30-year-olds reported actually having changed in the same period.
In other words, we suffer from what the researchers call the “end-of-history illusion,” where at every age, people underestimate how much they will change in the future and imagine that their current selves will remain constant until the end of history. Essentially, like the children in the pretzel test, we end up mispredicting future decisions by skewing towards current states.
Surprisingly, though, research also shows that we don’t have the same biases if we think about others’ future needs and wants. That is, even if a child overwhelmingly imagines wanting water tomorrow, they often imagine that a fellow pretzel-lover will revert to baseline and prefer pretzels.
“The term we've used with children and adults is ‘other-over-self advantage,’” Atance said. “What we mean by that is that when you're reasoning about another person versus yourself, you seem to kind of show an advantage in your reasoning, or you tend to predict more accurately.”
We may not know the cause of this “other-over-self advantage” phenomenon, but it is still exciting to know that imagining the futures of others can help us better predict our own. This gives us a superpower of sorts, one that points us to a simple yet radical proposal — to think of others. Specifically, let’s think of the children: after all, we think more like they do than we might like to admit.
In July, I visited FUTURES, an eclectic-electric museum-festival in the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C. There, I marveled at exhibits that juxtaposed historical artifacts, like science fiction author Octavia Butler’s typewriter, with retro visions, like Robert McCall’s 1960 Space Sail of the Future. The Bakelizer, the first machine to create completely synthetic plastic material, was featured alongside afrofuturist art, biodegradable burial pods, and a live AI light show.
Amid the inventions and reinventions, the Museum invited visitors to reflect on what they expect or hope for in the future. Last month, the FUTURES team summarized the data from their 650,000 visitors. One major conclusion was sad if unsurprising: People are much more optimistic that large-scale crises will be solved by innovation and technology — not peaceful, cooperative, human-centered solutions.
I wonder if this lack of optimism comes from a similar “end-of-history illusion,” where we can imagine the things and technologies around us changing more than we see ourselves changing. But this reasoning may be short-sighted, since technology is a product of society, and our institutions and customs are ultimately mutable. If technologies are mutable, does that not mean our ideas – which both help create and are shaped by that technology — change as well? How much would our predictions change if, instead of thinking about how we see the future, we think collectively about how our peers will? What if we think of the children?
When we think of the children, we can think for them (how we owe them a good world to grow into) and think about them (how they reveal our own failings), and we can think like them, too. According to the FUTURES data, the youngest visitors were “more likely to talk to friends and family about the future after seeing the exhibition, to see solutions for the future that were exciting to them, and to recognize similarities between themselves and the people shaping the future.”
At the FUTURES exhibit, I found myself reading through the handwritten reflections — predictions spanning generations pinned across the walls. I noticed common threads and personal goals: exploration and education, new jobs and opportunities, health, and relationships. Of all the visitor-submitted notecards that I read, I was most struck by those written by children under 10 — rumpled and compassionate hopes to work hard and “save enyrgy."
One note in particular stood out: “I will write my letters to make a future that is bright.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Harvard tour mentions the many hours of deep discussion a first-year has in Annenberg, or the close-knit community formed in the Houses — as if each dining hall is like a family table. As I became an Orthodox Jew, I left behind the endless rows of the Berg and the ornate ceilings of Leverett to eat in a building some students don’t even know serves food: Harvard Hillel.
Like many other first-years, I loved Annenberg. Entering with my card out, I would hand it over to John so that he could shout “The Glassman!” back to me. The room looked like the way Harvard is supposed to feel, with statues in the back and entrancing stained-glass windows throughout. More so than the appearance, or what now seems like plentiful options of food, the people roaming around made Annenberg lively. Most of the faces that I recognize when I walk around campus were imprinted in my memory next to the Veritaffle press or at a table of twelve people whom I’d never met. This exposure to so many different people is exactly what Harvard intends for first-years and tries to mimic for upperclassmen.
The House dining halls are seemingly supposed to be miniature versions of Annenberg. Whether you are in Leverett or Pforzheimer, you will meet a representative sampling of the Harvard student body. A student who properly takes advantage of the House dining hall has many people to wave to in the SEC even if they are a Comp Lit concentrator.
I began sophomore year by sitting with my roommates in Leverett House, slowly acclimating to the environment and meeting the tutors, other students, and staff. Only a few months later, when I began to follow the rules of Kashrus (keeping kosher) more seriously, my roommates would joke about whether I was really a Leverett House student. I had no hard feelings toward them. After all, I almost never ate in the dining hall. When I’d get back to our suite, they would ask, “Where did you go? Hillel to Chabad then back to Hillel and then Chabad?”
I’d answer, “Basically, yeah.”
But as my world has grown smaller, it has also grown deeper. In Annenberg, I had to reintroduce myself during every meal. It was a struggle to keep track of everyone’s names. If I met someone who lived in Hollis one day, I had to store that fact in the back of my mind so that I could ask the next Hollis resident if they knew each other. Despite my Rolodex of names, intended concentrations, hometowns, and dorms, I didn’t really get to know that many people. While most of the people I wave to in the streets are from Annenberg, very few of those who would stop me to have a conversation are.
With so few people eating at Hillel, I had to get past introductions quickly. I didn’t start keeping kosher because I only wanted to eat with the people at Hillel. Most of the regulars at Hillel, I met because I started keeping kosher. I no longer had the opportunity to get the most out of Harvard by meeting everyone; instead, I had to get to know these few people very well.
We can learn about the world in two ways. We can go everywhere, meet everyone, and read every book. This exploration will make us understand ourselves far better. It will grow us through new reference points and memories. It is part of the reason why studying history or reading older books are such valuable endeavors: They are foreign to us. They speak about human experience, but are distanced from our circumstances. This is essentially Annenberg.
Yet, in “Siddhartha,” Herman Hesse articulates an alternative — one that involves appreciating the miraculous depth of the world by exploring one place. In this book, the eponymous character finds themself being taken across a river by a ferryman named Vasudeva. Siddhartha is confused as to how Vasudeva retains such a refined soul and sagacious disposition after spending his whole life crossing the same river back and forth. Vasudeva responds, “The river has taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well. It knows everything, the river, everything can be learned from it. See, you’ve already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek depth.”
So how are we to take advantage of our time at Harvard in the wake of these seemingly opposite approaches to acquiring wisdom? Should we take classes in every subject at the broadest level to gain an appreciation of every aspect of human knowledge? Or should we make one thing our own, no matter how particular it is, and understand that thing with incredible profundity?
Judaism has a strong imperative of Torah study. But deciding how to tackle such study can be overwhelming. There is an essentially infinite amount of material that one can learn about the Torah, from the narratives in Kings to the intricate laws of how to build a Sukkah. One could spend one’s entire life looking at any verse in the Torah, studying every commentary on the verse; or one could get a taste of all the different niches within the world of Torah, without developing expertise in any topic.
When the great Rabbi Hillel the Elder was asked to summarize the entire Torah while standing on one foot, he said “What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation of this — go and study it!” Hillel teaches us that we can both seek to understand this maxim as wholly as possible, and through that realize the meaning of the rest of the Torah, or we can learn the whole Torah and from that be able to appreciate this maxim.
Such is the case at Harvard. We can try and meet everyone on campus, or we can really get to know a few people. We can join every club, study abroad, and travel the world, but all the while not really know anything about Cambridge beyond the gates of Harvard. At the same time, if we spend all our time exploring every nook and cranny of Harvard Square, we’ll miss the whole world. We can also take classes in every discipline, to familiarize ourselves with ecology, English, and Economics. Or we can gain a Ph.D. level of knowledge in just one of them. The instantiations of this dichotomy are endless, and there is no heuristic to tell us which one is better than the other. But we shouldn’t fear, because both will grow our wisdom if we show proper concern.

More than 100 Harvard affiliates attended an Indigenous People’s Day celebration organized by Natives at Harvard College on Monday.
The event, held in front of Matthews Hall, featured speeches, a dance performance and snacktime to encourage community building.
In a statement, the NaHC wrote it was “so excited” about the turnout.
“IPD is NaHC’s largest event of the year, and we work for months in advance to organize for the day,” the organization’s board wrote in a statement sent via text. “Our goal is to elevate the voices of the Indigenous community on campus and emphasize the importance of recognizing, celebrating, and listening to Indigenous people.”
Jovan Lim ’25, an international student from Singapore, said the event was important to showcase Indigenous history.
“There are not many platforms in Harvard through which we can know more about the indigenous peoples community, and I’m not from the community,” he said. “Harvard has had a very tumultuous history with Indigenous peoples, and it’s important to recognize that.”
Anthony M. Trujillo, a Ph.D. candidate and History Department teaching fellow from the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, said Indigenous People’s Day is a “celebration of Indigenous life and presence” and a show of solidarity towards Native students.
“This university just can’t ignore Indigenous life, thought, creativity, if it wants to be a leading institution in the next years and decades, centuries to come,” he said.
The NaHC organizers criticized Harvard, saying the University “harms Indigenous people on campus and around the globe in many” ways.
“Harvard still recognizes Columbus Day, still benefits from land dispossession from Massachusetts to Brazil, still doesn’t offer Indigenous Studies/Ethnic Studies, still doesn’t teach many Indigenous languages nor allow Indigenous studies to use their languages for their language requirement,” the group’s statement read.
Harvard spokespeople declined to comment.
NaHC board members added that they are “very grateful for the amazing work that the Harvard University Native American Program does to support Native students.”
“The funding, programming, and community they provide really supports our community,” they wrote.
Sami E. Turner ’25, a resident of Lawrence, Kansas, said her proximity to Indigenous people in her hometown gave her more opportunities to learn about Native history and culture.
“There’s a pretty substantial indigenous population in my hometown, because of the [Haskell’s Indian Nations] University, and so I felt like there were much more opportunities to learn about the community,” she said. “But I don’t feel like, on Harvard’s campus, I’ve seen as much.”
“I don’t think Harvard has offered a lot of resources or events to talk about Indigenous history and culture, as it pertains specifically to Harvard's history,” Turner added.
The NaHC hosts other events throughout the year such as open mics, fundraisers and community meals.
Olyvia L. Snyder ’26, a freshman on the Women’s Rugby team, said she and others attended the event to support a Native Hawaiian teammate who helped organize the event.
“She has done a great job of bringing awareness to this event as a whole and to Indigenous people,” she said.

Consumer protection expert Eugene I. “Gene” Kimmelman discussed the global impact of the European Union’s digital market regulations at a Harvard Kennedy School event on Tuesday.
The event, hosted by the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, focused on the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which aims to restrict anticompetitive behavior by powerful technology companies. Negotiated by the European Council and the European Parliament in March, the DMA will impose restraints on large technology companies, such as browsers and social networks.
Kimmelman, who previously served as chief counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, discussed the control that large technology companies — including Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta — hold over smaller businesses that use their online platforms.
After providing an overview of the DMA’s design and implementation, Kimmelman discussed the legislation’s impact on the American market. He said technology giants will likely be forced to comply with the DMA even outside of the EU.
“They can’t run two fundamentally different businesses,” he said in an interview after the event. “The U.S. policy process will be influenced by the actual implementation of the DMA.”
Kimmelman added that maintaining a competitive digital market will bolster American democracy.
“You can’t have open ideas without having possibilities of competition in businesses,” he said.
He said the DMA will work in tandem with similar, pre-existing antitrust laws and competition policies.
“Interventions like the DMA are, to me, a welcome pushback against the tendency to monopolize these key markets,” Kimmelman said.
John A. Haigh, co-director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center, said in an interview that the DMA’s approach to digital market regulation is unprecedented.
“I think that the DMA is setting up a kind of ex ante approach of regulating platforms that doesn't exist in the United States,” he said. “And that is really going to shape significantly global regulation.”
The American public is typically less receptive to regulatory policy than Europeans, Kimmelman said. But he said he expects that in time, Americans will come to favor the preservation of competition in digital markets.
“I think there’ll be an understanding on a basic level that having more choices of what to do when you’re in the Google ecosystem, or you’re in the Amazon ecosystem, or the metaverse, is a good thing,” Kimmelman said.
“It plays to the natural instincts of Americans to have choice and to have more freedom to pick and choose the products and services they want,” he added.

Members of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences gathered in the Science Center Tuesday for their first in-person meeting since February 2020.
The FAS discussed a range of issues including a cluster hire for climate scholars, a report on faculty workload, Harvard’s new mental health campaign, and an upcoming change in their dental insurance plan.
Though University President Lawrence S. Bacow typically leads faculty meetings, FAS Dean Claudine Gay took charge on Tuesday, saying Bacow was “under the weather.”
On the docket for Tuesday’s meeting was a presentation from Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability James H. Stock on the vision and priorities for the newly established Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.
In June, the University announced the establishment of the Salata Institute, funded by a $200 million donation from Melanie Salata and Jean E. Salata. Stock has been charged with directing the institute.
Gay said during Tuesday’s meeting that the launch of the institute “signals Harvard’s commitment to bringing its academic resources to bear on the existential challenge of climate change.”
“We have an opportunity both to partner with other Schools and the Institute and to capitalize on our unique strengths and identities — chief among them, our academic breadth,” she said Tuesday.
In a June email to all FAS department chairs, Gay announced the launch of a cluster hire for up to three senior appointments for scholars in environment, climate, and sustainability. She called on all departments to identify and nominate individuals for consideration in the hire.
Stock emphasized the importance of working across academic disciplines to address climate issues, referring to a University report issued last month on the future of Harvard’s climate education.
Gay also discussed the FAS Faculty Workload Committee’s report, which she shared with the faculty at the end of last month. The Faculty Workload Committee was convened in fall 2021 as part of the FAS Strategic Planning process to assess faculty workload expectations and the distribution of responsibilities within and across departments.
According to the report, the Committee found that there is an “increasing and unsustainable” amount of non-research work expected of faculty and that non-research work is distributed inequitably across faculty. To address the concerns, it recommended that the FAS look into where work can be eliminated, streamlined, or delegated to administrative staff. The report also suggested the FAS establish clear expectations about the amount of non-research work that faculty should take on.
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen also provided faculty members with a public health update.
He began by describing Harvard’s new telehealth services and mental health awareness campaign. Encouraging faculty to stay informed on Harvard’s mental health resources, Nguyen pointed to the Crimson Folder, a school-specific document outlining how to recognize and assist a student in distress. He added that faculty will receive training on how to support students in need.
Professor of the Arts Vijay Iyer raised concerns about the privacy of students who utilize campus mental health resources. He said he would like to refer his students to resources, but he finds it difficult to reassure them that their records will be kept in confidence.
In response, Nguyen talked about University, state, and federal regulations protecting the privacy and security of health records.
The first faculty meeting of the academic year was marked by a change in venue: faculty meetings before the pandemic were typically hosted in University Hall. The shift in location, according to Gay, was “carefully considered.”
Subsequent meetings will be held on Zoom, except for the final meeting of the year, which will take place in Sanders Theater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LGBTQ+ advocates discussed their coming out experiences and activist work in honor of National Coming Out Day at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Tuesday evening.
The panel, co-hosted by the IOP and the Shorenstein Center, aimed to increase LGBTQ+ visibility on Harvard’s campus. David Grasso, CEO of Bold TV, moderated the discussion, which featured author Keith O. Boykin, Harvard Kennedy School Fellow Ian Daniel, political commentator Sally R. Kohn, Newton city councilor Holly Ryan, and Zander S. Moricz ’26, a litigant in Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” lawsuit.
The conversation kicked off with a discussion of individual coming out experiences and the support networks needed to facilitate inclusivity.
“The first person I ever came out to was actually a teacher,” Moricz said. “I think that's why when we see this sacred, safe, guaranteed space being polluted for so many children, what you're seeing is that loss of an opportunity to have a community that is accepting and that will allow you to nurture and identify your identity.”
Moricz’s district in Sarasota, Fla. became one of the first counties to adopt Governor Ron DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” policies, which require district faculty and administrators to report if a student comes out or changes their pronouns to the student’s family.
Moricz led his organization — the Social, Equity, and Education Initiative — in protest against the “Don’t Say Gay” policies.
“We immediately exploded with hundreds of rallies and protests and walk-outs, and we did so much immediate organizing to try to put this in the public sphere,” Moricz said in an interview following the forum.
In the interview, Moricz said his activism comes from a sense of fear and urgency.
“It is not motivation. It’s not inspiration. It’s fear,” Moricz said. “I am directing the efforts in Florida while attending school at Harvard because I’m horrified about what will happen if I let go of all of this work.”
During the panel, Boykin discussed the impact of discriminatory policies on intersectional identities, particularly LGBTQ+ people of color. He said as a student at Harvard Law School decades ago, he recognized the need for progress.
“But as a Black man and a Black gay man — I think a lot of people in the Black community — we’ve been feeling this for hundreds of years. There was never a time we felt, for most of us, when we felt safe in this country,” Boykin said.
While at law school, Boykin co-created the Coalition for Civil Rights, an organization of multiple affinity groups aimed at creating a unified campus activist movement.
In an interview after the event, Daniel said Harvard students are urging administrators to establish LGBTQ+ and anti-racism education practices. He currently works alongside students at the Kennedy School to advocate for systemic change at the University.
“What I was seeing around LGBT issues was disturbing. There was no education around it. There were death threats happening on campus. There was bigoted language in my own cohort,” Daniel said. “I just saw a systemic problem.”
In his interview after the panel, Moricz highlighted the need for widespread LGBTQ+ advocacy.
“This is an emergency, and the reaction needs to be from everyone that this is an emergency,” he said. “Our reactions, our organizing, our movements need to be urgent and aggressive because this is an urgent, aggressive problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana and Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget T. Long discussed pathways to education careers at an event hosted by the College on Tuesday.
The administrators highlighted partnerships between the College and the Graduate School of Education before a small crowd of students in Harvard’s Smith Campus Center.
“If you’re looking to maximize impact, there is no job that will give you greater satisfaction than being a teacher,” Long said at the event.
The event comes as HGSE is promoting a new master’s program in Teaching and Teacher Leadership, which began this fall.
Long talked about several pathways to education for undergraduates, such as the education secondary offered at the College. Harvard recently shut down two programs that offered a pathway to teaching for College students. The Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, which allowed students to earn their teaching certification while in College, was shuttered last year. The Harvard Teacher Fellows program, an initiative that trained undergraduates to become teachers during and immediately after their time at the College, was folded into HGSE’s new master’s program.
“We want to build on what the college has already been able to do, especially for our teacher education candidates,” Long said. “Part of what tonight is about is just to make sure that you understand that with all of the changes, there are so many opportunities there for you, and it's really about growing those opportunities now.”
At the event, Long lauded connections between HGSE and the College and said she hopes to expand education offerings at Harvard.
“I think that the sky’s the limit because, in many respects, we want to be as inclusive as possible for anyone who believes in the importance of education and wants to work with us,” she said.
Long, who was appointed as chair of the National Board for Education Sciences by President Barack Obama, discussed the impact of Covid-19 on education, saying the education system reflects broader societal inequities.
“The inequities I’m talking about have been around for decades, but then, when the pandemic happened, it just shows how stark the differences are,” she said.
Khurana asked audience members whether a student organization — similar to the Harvard Institute of Politics, housed at the Harvard Kennedy School — would help interest undergraduates in education.
“I think part of the promise of college is that you find your sub-communities — you find your people — in certain interests,” he said.
Midway through the event, Khurana, who moderated, asked audience members to weigh in on student interest in pursuing a career in education. Hannah B. Thurlby ’23 said many students feel pressure to take higher-paying jobs after graduation.
“There is that pressure, I think, from a lot of students at the College: ‘Oh, you’re not going to make X amount of money immediately after graduation,’” she said.
Thurlby suggested for other students in the room to seek out current teachers and peers interested in the education sector for encouragement and advice.
Long encouraged attendees to be open to stints in other fields, recalling her own experience as a Goldman Sachs intern.
“I was bored out of my mind,” she said. “Like, really? I’m supposed to stay up all night for what? Doing a spreadsheet? I’ll stay up all night when we’re talking about real things and having impact and helping and prompting people. That’s worth it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Luanne Lee returned to work on a rainy day earlier this spring, her feet were soaking wet.
She had just trekked through an ankle-high pool of water to move her car from a flooding parking lot at the Riverwind Casino in Norman, Oklahoma, where she worked.
Soon after making it inside, she realized her co-worker who was walking alongside her, Jeremy C. Hendley, had disappeared into the downpour.
More than 30 minutes later, he returned — bearing a dry pair of shoes and socks to help her get through the shift.
“I’ll never forget that,” she said. “That was just how kind-hearted he was — always thinking of others.”
Whether it was as a husband, friend, co-worker, student, or dog dad, Hendley always found selfless ways to solve others’ problems, according to friends and family.
Hendley, a first-year student at Harvard Law School, died by suicide on Sept. 2. He was 35.
Born June 27, 1987, in Ada, Oklahoma, Hendley developed a passion for legal studies as an undergraduate at East Central University, where he graduated in 2015. According to Christine Pappas, one of Hendley’s professors and mentors at ECU, he was a perfectionist and a straight-A student, motivated by a desire to help his wife gain American citizenship.
“It was a joy to me to hear him talk so passionately about wanting to serve,” Pappas said. “Becoming an attorney was his highest goal.”
Hendley’s wife, Alma A. Hendley, was unaware for years that she might be eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country at a young age.
Jeremy Hendley supported her through a decade-long legal process that eventually allowed her to become a U.S. citizen.
“Together we researched opportunities available to me and he eventually learned about the DACA program,” Alma Hendley wrote in a statement to The Crimson.
Even after enrolling in DACA, Alma Hendley said her path to citizenship left her in a constant “legal limbo” because of the “excruciating” expectations for applicants.
“I had to do a lot of the legal hurdles that many Dreamers have to go through,” she said in an interview. “Jeremy was there for all of that.”
After many setbacks and delays — including record wait times caused by the Covid-19 pandemic — Alma Hendley was granted U.S. citizenship on December 13, 2021.
“Without Jeremy as advocate and as a sponsor for me I would not have my U.S. Citizenship,” Alma Hendley wrote.
The two were married for 12 years.
“A lot of our friends sometimes would say, ‘Gosh, you guys have been together for a long time. How do you make it work?’” she said. “I think part of it was just learning to grow together and change together.”
Alma Hendley added that her husband’s love extended to Louis, an 11-year-old white standard poodle they adopted as a rescue.
“That was his baby, and he would do anything for him,” Alma Hendley said. “What he loved was spending time with Louis, talking about Louis, showing pictures to his employees about him.”
Growing up, Hendley developed a passion for card games and the intellectual challenge they presented. After college, he worked as a dealer for the Chickasaw Nation’s Riverwind Casino, where he was soon promoted to train new employees.
Over 16 years working for the Chickasaw Nation Division of Commerce, Hendley mentored many who went through the casino’s training program.
“If you go through training, you’re going to meet Jeremy,” recalled Tia Q. Le, a co-worker Hendley trained when she first began working at the casino three years ago.
Le said she remembers Jeremy as “a very good dresser,” a “kind soul” who “never got frustrated at any of the students,” and as “hands down, the best dealer I’ve ever seen.”
“He was brilliant — you know the minute you see him,” Le said. “You have to know, mentally, a lot of math. You have to do it really quickly. And he was so fast.”
“I was so lucky to have him as a teacher. I don’t think I would have been as successful as I was without him,” she added.
Luanne Lee, who worked alongside Hendley in the Chickasaw Nation’s training department for five years, said he was known at work as “a good person, but also the trainer — the person to go to, the person that knew it all.”
Hendley was put in charge of managing Blackjack, Ultimate Texas Hold ’Em, Jackpot Hold ’Em, Craps, and Roulette, among other table games at the casino, according to Lee.
“Every game that the Chickasaw Nation trains, he knew it — even poker,” Lee said.
Hendley was “like one of my own kids,” she added.
Co-workers also remember Jeremy Hendley’s sense of humor and knowledgeability.
“The Riverwind Casino community loved him,” Lee said. “He was the backup for everything: ‘Go to Jeremy. Let’s ask Jeremy. He’ll know.’ Everyone just loved him.”
Attending Harvard Law School was Jeremy Hendley’s ultimate dream, according to his friends and family. When he learned he was accepted, Hendley was “the happiest person in the world,” Lee said.
“I got to see him every day with a smile from ear to ear on his face, walking five feet off the ground,” Lee said. “He was the proudest and the happiest person that I’ve ever seen.”
Brian T. Broderick, a first-year Law School student who was in Jeremy Hendley’s section, said he first met Hendley online over the summer via LinkedIn and Slack.
“I got the sense that he was friendly,” Broderick said. “I got the sense that he was really looking forward to coming to Harvard and being part of the HLS community. Nothing but positive.”
When the two finally met on campus during the Law School’s first-year orientation, they instantly bonded.
“I really got the impression that he was someone who was very giving and very selfless — that he was at HLS to do things that were bigger than himself,” Broderick said.
“He didn’t seem like someone who was into this for his own goals or someone who just wants to line his own pockets,” he added. “He really wanted to make a difference.”
After he was accepted to Harvard Law School last spring, Hendley set his eyes on a career as an immigration attorney.
“He really admired that Harvard had a DACA clinic, and that was something that he was looking forward to doing,” Alma Hendley said. “He went out of his way to help people, and I know people say that a lot about their loved ones, but Jeremy was an on-call guy all the time.”
Pappas said she remembered Hendley’s eagerness to mentor her students at East Central University after he was accepted to HLS, offering to help them on the LSAT and seek out letters of recommendation.
“He was 100 percent helpful and positive all the time,” she said. “Couldn’t wait to help other people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a disappointing loss to division rival Princeton the previous week, the Harvard men’s water polo team entered last weekend with a grim determination and something to prove.
And prove it did. The Crimson (10-4, 4-1 Ivy League) emerged from the long weekend with a three game winning streak. Harvard swept all three opponents, besting Brown (9-7, 2-3) and Connecticut (1-6) on Saturday on a back-to-back road trip, before returning to Cambridge on Sunday to dismantle MIT (3-10, 1-5 NEWMAC).
“As far as a wake-up call goes, that was really how we took that loss as a team,” said junior center Kaleb Archer on the game against Princeton.
Archer felt the loss was good motivation for the team to focus on improving its game-plan, aiming to avoid repeats of any mistakes the team had made at Princeton –– including losses.
Head coach Ted Minnis attributed Harvard’s ability to bounce back so successfully from its previous loss to the level of seniority and experience present in the current team; many players have won before with the Crimson during its undefeated run in 2019 for the NWPC Championship.
“They understand that each game is a new opportunity to improve,” Minnis said. “I think we came back and had a good week of practice, and worked on correcting things that hindered us in the game. We’re doing a better job of executing.”
Although Harvard’s hard work this week paid dividends, the games were not without their own separate challenges. Last Saturday saw a doubleheader for the Crimson, starting early in the morning in Providence, RI where Harvard battled Brown. This game would be the first time the Crimson has faced Brown this season, but the matchup also carried weight beyond the typical Ivy-versus-Ivy rivalry; last season, Harvard had lost to the Bears 13-15 for third-place in the 2021 NWPC Championships despite posting a perfect record against Brown all season.
The Crimson was able to dominate play, scoring early in the game. The goal from senior center defender Gabe Putnam opened the floodgates for six consecutive goals scored by Harvard in the first quarter. Yet, with three seconds left in the first quarter, Brown’s Matt Simko was able to sneak one into the net to set the score at 9-4 in favor of the Crimson. The Bears’ scoring would catch Harvard by surprise, with Brown managing to out-score a quenched Crimson team in the fourth quarter 4-2.
“I think sometimes the games where you come out with a big lead are the ones that are a little bit mentally more difficult,” Archer explained. “With the closer games, you’re locked in because that’s the competitive nature, and the game’s tight, so obviously you can feel how much every possession matters, and you’re just grinding that out. I think that’s one of the things that really surprised me, is sometimes those games where you’re four or five up, you really need to fight that mental battle to stay locked in.”
Though Harvard’s strong play ensured a secure lead, these lapses in game-time dominance from the team cost it valuable goals, and this concentration is an element that the team is working to improve on.
“That was an example of us waxing and waning, in a sense,” Archer admitted. “I think there were flashes when we were doing the right things, but there were also some times where we’re making some mental lapses that let them back into it. But I think all-in-all, it was a great learning game and a big step for us.”
Despite these few slip-ups, Harvard had a strong showing against its rivals in Providence, ultimately defeating Brown 15 to 10. Junior attacker Owen Hale scored four goals, and senior goalie Noah Hodge put on a solid 12 save performance. The game was an especially big milestone for junior defender Cam Dougherty, who recorded his first ever career hat-trick.
“I’m proud of Cam: his first career hat-trick, and to do it in a rivalry game is a testament to his hard work,” Minnis said.
Dougherty had been a center for the past two years and had come into the season’s training camp as such. Yet, with the addition of many new faces, including first-year utility James Rozolis-Hill (who posted two goals against Brown), the team’s depth chart was starting to crowd. Dougherty then shifted to defender, stepping up to excel in his new position. The hat-trick, among other things, looks to be a promising sign of what Dougherty has to offer in the reconfigured roster.
Following its victory at Brown, a tired Crimson team continued its Saturday trip with a stop at Connecticut College. Evidently, commuting from a major rivalry game, with all of its emotions and exhaustion, to a game against another conference team is not without its drawbacks.
“Rolling that right in the Conn. College game was very mentally and physically draining,” Archer remarked. “Playing two games, three hours apart, while traveling to-and-from them was a quick, quick turnaround. I think it sort of was an exercise in our mental fortitude, and I think the guys executed super well.”
Fortitude was something Connecticut also struggled with: it was also playing a doubleheader and had lost to MIT on its senior day earlier that morning. Harvard would add to Connecticut’s loss column, seizing a decisive 20-6 victory over the Camels. Both Rozolis-Hill and sophomore attacker Alex James were able to net four goals each, with this marking James’ first four-goal performance of the season.
It was the second time this season that Harvard has been able to score 20 or more goals in a single game. This performance put the team in a strong position as it returned to Cambridge to face off against its final opponents for the weekend.
If the game against Brown had been defined by Harvard’s initial dominance, the game against MIT was less so. Last October, the Crimson had splashed to a slightly chippy 16-10 victory against the Engineers. Though the score had compounded to a heftier 21-11 victory this time around, the flaws from last season’s match-up had not necessarily been erased. Once again, Harvard struggled in the first half, giving up the lead early to MIT and having to fight to turn the tide.
“I still think we gave up too many goals in the MIT game,” said Minnis, while noting MIT’s strong ability to capitalize on the Crimson’s mistakes and score on their powerplay as key factors in what made this game challenging.
Archer also commented on the slower start from Harvard, attributing it to a “feeling-out process” for getting a good grasp of MIT’s current roster and play style.
Harvard would luckily go on to find its offensive footing, netting seven consecutive goals to establish a 9-3 lead. By the fourth quarter, the Crimson would only allow one goal while roping together seven for itself.
“I think our in-practice preparation this week really had us ready for it,” explained Archer, referring to the team’s ability to turn the game around. “We knew exactly what they were gonna go out and do, and they sort of played exactly into it, and we were able to handle it well.”
He also attributed Harvard’s success to the team’s fitness, noting it as a means of outlasting opponents while playing at a high-level.
Another decisive factor for the win, decided Minnis, was the presence of first-year goalie Tanner Furtak in net. Despite this being his first match against MIT, Furtak was able to settle in during the second half to make a total of six saves.
Though only a first-year, Furtak has been able to step in and step up where he is needed most––not only as another goalie between the pipes to share the season workload with starter goalie Noah Hodge, but also as the future of the program. With senior Hodge leaving next year, Furtak will be expected to take over the net.
Luckily, he’s been getting plenty of experience and help.
“[Hodge], our captain, has been like a great mentor for him,” Archer mentioned. “In practice, we’re scrimmaging, and they’re on opposite sides of the pool––it doesn’t feel like there’s a drop off. They’re both working very hard, doing great things.”
Given the opportunity to learn from the one Minnis called “one of the best goalies in the world, and one of the top goalies on the east coast”, will be undoubtedly valuable for Furtak’s development.
In the meantime, the Crimson looks ahead to its next few games this weekend. The tough lineup features Long Beach State (12-6, 1-1 Big West) and Pomona (9-11, 4-1 SCIAC). All four upcoming games will take place at home in Blodgett Pool, with three happening as part of the Harvard Invitational. As part of the series, the Crimson will take on the No. 6 ranked team in the nation (Harvard currently sits at number 13), but the team doesn’t seem to mind.
“We’re really excited about that, and the opportunity to show how externally competitive our conference, the east coast water polo, and our team specifically can be,” Archer said.
With regards to any takeaways or lessons from this weekend, Minnis reiterated the importance of striving for continuous improvement.
“[We] still have a lot of work to do,” Minnis remarked. “I think for us, just keep getting better at every phase of the game. This is a staircase that we’re climbing, and we gotta be at the top every November.”
Also to look forward to this weekend is the Long Beach State game on October 15th which will be the team’s featured Breast Cancer Awareness game.
“Raising awareness in any sense for breast cancer is something that is very near and dear to our team and personally,” Archer said. “I’m excited that that’s the cause that we can champion and raise awareness for while playing our sport.”
