After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the Saturday night of April 26, 1959, a teeming crowd of more than 10,000 gathered at the Dillon Field House to welcome an intriguing visitor. Long before he was scheduled to speak, concerns were already brewing over audience size, security, and even a failed bomb threat. Even more worrisome than the logistics of the visit was what it represented. Democracy, U.S. foreign policy, and the future of a nation were brought into question. Taking these manifold concerns and questions in stride, Harvard welcomed with open arms the arrival of Fidel Castro: revolutionary, liberator, and, for one night, the center of campus life.After a guerrilla campaign, the young Cuban leader had defeated then-President Fulgencio Batista’s forces and ousted the dictatorial government in January of that year. By March of 1959, Castro had accepted an invitation to speak at the American Society of Newspaper Editors’ annual convention in Washington D.C. He then planned an 11-day tour of North America, speaking in New York, Montreal, and at Harvard.Although Castro may have initially been invited to the United States by a private organization, he chose to speak at universities because he said, “that is where you find the real ‘military spirit,’ in students, not in the barracks.” Castro was on a tour, but the fact that he was coming to Harvard was still monumental for many. “It was huge, from Harvard’s point of view, it was huge,” said Michael D. Lockshin ’59.CASTRO THE LIBERATOR Many students were excited and curious to see the face of the future of Cuba. According to Michael D. Lockshin ’59, “He had been on a triumphant tour and students were in favor of him… he was a romantic hero to the students I knew.” Willard Emery, Jr. ’59 agreed, saying that “Batista was seen as a corrupt oppressor of the Cuban people and Fidel Castro was seen as coming from the mountains as a liberator.” Studying government at the time, Jonathan S. Barker ’59 said he left the speech with positive reactions. “He stood out as revolutionary in the context of Harvard… he was part of some change that I thought was positive on the whole and was an example of a kind of activism that was pretty new for me. He didn’t strike me as someone who was anti-democratic, so I was quite hopeful,” said Barker. Barker recounted how Castro’s visit was the crest of a wave of visits from leaders and nationalists from African nations and Cyprus and that it was part of a trend of “big changes.” But not all in the audience shared Barker’s positive impressions. Although he said he entered with high expectations, Lockshin said that “the speech… was very, very long, challenging the most mind-numbing of professors for inducing restlessness in the crowd.” The biggest “turn-off” for Lockshin was Castro’s comment regarding the rights of a government to appeal trials just as if it were a private party. This incident was also noted in the New York Times for inducing hissing at Harvard. “We had gone expecting all positive things and we were quite disturbed,” Lockshin said. His brother, Richard A. Lockshin ’59 had similar recollections. “I remember it—and mention it today—as a turning point in attitudes of many U.S. citizens toward Cuba,” Richard A. Lockshin said. He even quit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he had been a member of, after Castro’s visit.A HAVANA HARBINGERCastro’s visit to Harvard and to the United States in general marked a decisive time for Cuban-American relations. Prior to his visit, a New York Times article even said that the visit was, in some ways, the most important test that Castro had faced thus far. Seen as a liberator of Cuba and a harbinger of democracy, Castro was welcomed warmly by many, especially at Harvard. However, others still harbored animosity toward him. Issues of security were problematic at all the venues that hosted Castro. The situation was especially chaotic in Boston, where, prior to Castro’s arrival, a man from Massachusetts was found in New York’s Central Park with a homemade, and most likely unusable, bomb. But the visit was viewed largely as a success, and, according to the New York Times, made Americans and Castro feel better about each other. These hopeful feelings and possibilities of friendly relations between the two countries were nevertheless quickly dispelled. In 1960, ties severely worsened as Cuba increasingly supported the Soviet economy. By 1961, Castro had declared Cuba a socialist state and abolished free elections. Confrontations such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis revealed the deep tensions that had quickly developed since Castro departed Harvard a few years prior. Today, the United States still holds a trade embargo against Cuba. Travel restrictions also hinder the exchange of ideas and cultures between citizens of the two nations. AN ACADEMIC EXCEPTIONAlthough Americans are not permitted to freely enter Cuba, Harvard students are. Despite hostile foreign policies that the United States still holds towards Cuba, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS) is nevertheless committed to fostering academic exchange with Cuban institutions. The Cuban Studies Program, established in 1999, strives to bring together faculty and students who study Cuba, to assist Cuban scholars and scientists, and to strengthen institutional bonds of study. According to Lybia M. Rivera, Cuba Program Coordinator, the program has been vastly successful thus far, bringing Cuban scholars to the United States, organizing academic conferences, and making strides in a variety of studies, from tropic medicine to social policy. It functions with the belief that “restoring and enhancing cooperation between the U.S. and Cuban academic communities can play a significant role in promoting peaceful changes within and between our two countries,” according to the DRCLAS website. The obstacles that the Cuban Studies Program faces are great, but they are far from being deterrents for academic exchange. “Harvard never ‘embargoed’ Cuban scholars nor did Harvard seek to stand in the way of any member of our community studying or engaging in research in Cuba. The U.S. government, especially over the past five years, did both,” Jorge I. Dominguez, Vice Provost for International Affairs, wrote in an email. “Visas for Cuban scholars to visit the U.S. for short periods were characteristically denied; U.S. barriers to student research or study in Cuba became very high,” added Dominguez, who is also co-chair of the Cuban Studies Program. The other co-chair and Assistant Professor of Social Medicine Arachu Castro-San Juan said that because the relationship between Cuba and Harvard is academic and not political, the relationship is “excellent.” The Harvard College Program in Cuba is a key component of the initiative to strengthen ties between Harvard and Cuba. Since 2006, Harvard has been able to send a select group of students to study abroad for one semester at the University of Havana, Castro’s alma mater. Harvard students who go to Cuba must be juniors at the time and must have had at least six semesters of Spanish language training. These students are able to travel where few Americans have gone because of an institutionalized license granted by the U.S. Treasury Department. It took 18 months for Harvard to initially obtain the license, which must be renewed every year. In the fall semester of 2008, four Harvard students participated in this program. Christina M. Giordano ’10 was one of them. She said that although there were anti-American and anti-Bush sentiments in the media, the Cubans were very welcoming. “People were excited to find out there were Americans down there. It became more appealing to be a friend or significant other of an American,” she said. Giordano noted that many Cubans, who were socialist and thus, ideologically opposed to the United States, still admired the American economy and wanted to work here. She said that although being from Harvard often grabbed attention, it was the American connection that appealed to many Cubans. “Being American was the big tip off… being from Harvard was just icing to the cake,” she said. A LASTING IMPACTWillard Emery, Jr. ’59 recalled similar stories of Cuban excitement over American presence. “They loved Americans, they really did… they still consider us friends,” he said. Emery visited Cuba in 1995 but did not attend Castro’s speech in 1959. When Castro stepped foot on American soil in 1959, he embarked on an important journey, one that has been called a “turning point” and a “test.” During his 11 days, Castro answered many questions but many issues were still left gapingly ambiguous. The whirlwind tour had a lasting impact on Cuban-American relations, which quickly turned sour as the Cold War unfurled. Although Castro may not have directly addressed Cuban-Harvard relations, today, it is this partnership that has become the more cooperative and fruitful one. With the recent change in the heads of state in both nations, the issues surrounding Cuba are once again being questioned. While the United States government may still be ambivalent about the future of the Cuban-American relations, Harvard, represented by DRCLAS and the Cuban Studies Program, remains optimistic. “This is just the beginning and I am hopeful for more changes and that relations will improve and that the program will grow more,” Rivera said. “We’ve been able to do this even in times when relations between the countries have been in strain. I can only hope that it will get better,” Castro-San Juan said.It is perhaps fitting that now one of the places with the most unique, persistent, and progressive stance towards Cuba is the place where 50 years ago, a crowd of more than 10,000 lauded Castro with a standing ovation. —Staff writer Julia S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Miracles happen to those who believe in them,” Bernard Berenson, class of 1887, once said. And surely he must have believed in them. Though he began his life as a displaced Lithuanian immigrant, Berenson wound up a regent in the court of his own choosing. While he lived, Berenson was the chief diplomat of Italian Renaissance Art throughout the world. Considered a scholar of the highest order—though the insights of history have raised questions about his dealings in the art world—Berenson was friendly with and respected by the foremost literati of his day such as Oscar Wilde and Henry James. His word was often the only authority needed to verify the authenticity of a Da Vinci or Titian, and consequently, Berenson was an indispensable friend to collectors and dealers across the world.But perhaps Bernard Berenson’s greatest legacy was the villa which he called his own, and which became very much a part of who Berenson was—Villa I Tatti. “It is a machine à vivre, if you like, as there is a similar machine our bodies, but like my body my house has a soul—I hope,” Berenson once wrote.When Berenson died in October of 1959, at the age of 94, he bequeathed his estate, along with his library and art collection, to Harvard in the hopes that I Tatti would become a center of humanistic learning where younger scholars could come conduct research and encounter new ideas. And since it was first given to Harvard in 1959, Berenson’s Villa has become just that—an institutionalized arcadia that offers a small community of scholars the opportunity to nourish themselves with all the fruits of Berenson’s bouquet.A PRECOCIOUS CHILDBorn to a Jewish family in Lithuania, Berenson, along with his mother and two younger siblings, followed his father to Boston in 1875, when Berenson was 10 years old. He was a precocious child who could read German by the age of three and was already well-versed in authors of the Romantic period by the time he was 12. After graduating from Boston Latin School, Berenson attended Boston University for one year before transferring to Harvard in order to study Sanskrit, which Boston University did not offer. At Harvard, Berenson studied art history under Charles Eliot Norton and wrote literary essays for the Harvard Monthly, of which he was elected editor-in-chief in his senior year.After his graduation in 1887, Berenson had intended to be a critic and novelist, but a trip to Europe funded by Isabella Stewart Gardner and others convinced him to devote his life to studying Italian art.Berenson lingered in Europe well past his sponsored year, and when his pursuit of Italian painting led him to England in 1890, Berenson met Mary Smith Costelloe, who was married at the time with two young children. Costelloe followed Berenson to Florence as his pupil and lover. In 1900, a year after the death of her first husband, Costelloe married Berenson and the couple moved into I Tatti.APOGEE AND DEATHWidely regarded as the preeminent authority on Renaissance art, Berenson published several books on the Italian Renaissance and advised a number of museums and collectors in the United States, including most notably Isabella Stewart Gardner. Berenson once said famously that most of the major Italian pictures in America entered with his stamp on their passports.In the 1930s, despite having converted to Roman Catholicism, Berenson faced insecurity, first under Fascist authorities and later under the Nazis. “We are at the heart of the German rearguard action, and seriously exposed,” Berenson wrote in his diary in the summer of 1944. Berenson remained at I Tatti, though, and miraculously, the villa went untouched, as did most of his collections which had been relocated to a villa at Careggi. When Berenson died in 1959, he was buried in a small 18th century chapel on the property, beside his wife, who had died in 1945.BERENSON’S BEQUESTEven as the man shaped the villa, though, the villa shaped the man. “It made Berenson into the lord of that manor, the sage of that hermitage, the bait of that gilded trap,” wrote William F. Weaver, author of  “A Legacy of Excellence: The Story of Villa I Tatti.”Located in Fiesole at the western edge of Florence, the I Tatti estate covers 75 acres and contains about a dozen major buildings as well as an immaculately tended historic garden, which combines English and Italian landscape designs, and a working farm, which continues to produce wine and olive oil. The entrance is preceded by a long cypress avenue which ends in a small garden leading up to the magnificent Tuscan villa. As early as the 1910s, Berenson had made clear his desire to leave his house, library, and collection to Harvard, which he credited with opening intellectual doors to him as a penniless immigrant. Berenson reaffirmed this wish in the printed report of the 50th anniversary of the Class of 1887. The Center for Italian Renaissance Studies opened at I Tatti in 1961 and, from its inception, was devoted to scholarship on all aspects of the Italian Renaissance including art history, literary history, musical history, scientific history, and political, economic, and social history. Berenson would have preferred that the entire community be made up of critics and connoisseurs of art, but Harvard decided to make the center an interdisciplinary institute.“Research for the lust of research,” Berenson said a year before he died, “is not to be encouraged.” Berenson envisioned a humanistic institute that provided scholars with the opportunity to pursue long-term projects and intellectual interests and freed them from the urgent pressure to publish.“What counted,” according to I Tatti director Joseph Connors, “was to achieve the highest standards in these fields and to make an impact on international scholarship, as well as on the Florentine scholarly world.” The resources at I Tatti continue to attract broad scholarly interest. In accordance with Berenson’s wishes, his collection of about 120 priceless works of Renaissance art, as well as a few Asian and Islamic masterpieces, remains at the villa. The villa also houses the Berenson archive, with letters to and from the Berensons’ 1,400 correspondents, 6,000 letters between Bernard and Mary, their diaries, manuscripts, and other personal records.It is the library, though, which was most beloved by Berenson, who reportedly said that in an afterlife, he would have liked to haunt his library. Today, the Biblioteca Berenson has grown from the original 50,000 volumes to about 150,000 volumes, and over 300,000 photographs and other visual materials are housed in the Fototeca Berenson, which will soon be made digitally accessible.‘AN ARCADIA’Since the original class of six post-doctoral fellows first convened in 1961, the number of scholars I Tatti welcomes has grown to 15 full-year fellows and approximately 20 other fellows and visiting professors who stay for shorter terms. While the fellows were once all American, recent fellows have hailed from as far away as Australia, Ireland, and the Czech Republic. The fellows, whose fields range from art history and music history to English literature, are selected by a committee of scholars from around the world that meets annually at Harvard. According to Marica S. Tacconi, a professor of musicology at Pennsylvania State University who was a fellow at I Tatti for the 2002-2003 academic year, I Tatti provides a wonderful opportunity not only for scholars to have time away from their regular teaching responsibilities and to write, but also to interact with others who share an interest in Renaissance Italy. “The intellectual environment is so vibrant,” Tacconi said. “I really don’t think I could have written my book without it.”Machtelt Israels, a fellow in 2004-2005 from the University of Amsterdam, echoed Tacconi’s sentiment about the value of bringing scholars from across disciplines and countries together.“I think the place is a kind of arcadia,” Israels said. “Once you’ve got in there, you’re part of a wonderful humanist Renaissance-studying community.”Since taking over as head of I Tatti in 2002, Connors, previously a professor of art history at Columbia and the Director of the American Academy in Rome, has introduced several new one-semester fellowships including one for museum curators or others already working professionally and one for graduate students to pursue scholarship outside of their dissertation. Two graduate students per semester, usually from Harvard, but occasionally from other institutions, are selected as Readers at I Tatti on the basis of an application, interview, and recommendation.Yulia Ryzhik, a graduate student in English literature at Harvard, spent the fall semester at I Tatti this year.“I think it’s a really wonderful idea to have graduate students… come and take time off, not to work on their Ph.D.s, but just to read and broaden their horizons,” Ryzhik said.Ryzhik was joined this fall by Max M. Freeman, another graduate student at Harvard who reiterated the value of non project-based work. “The whole point is to ramble about on a sort of intellectual adventure,” said Freeman, who spent his time visiting churches and reading a lot of Boccaccio. Freeman said that the fellowship for graduate students is aimed at people who are not primarily Italian specialists. “I think the point is to sort of tempt people over to the Italian side of things,” he said. “And it works.”The whole I Tatti community gathers around an antique table for lunch, served at the estate every weekday. The lunches, while informal, provide an opportunity for scholars to exchange ideas and cement long-term friendships. “At lunch, you mingle, you socialize, you talk about your work, you commiserate about your progress or lack thereof,” Tacconi said. “When you live so closely together and you share so much of your work, you really become close, not only as colleagues but as friends as well.” I Tatti also sponsors a regular lecture series and organizes field trips for the fellows to Florence and other Italian cities. An annual conference in the spring draws prominent Renaissance scholars from around the world. This October, in honor of the 50th anniversary of Berenson’s death, the villa will host a three-day symposium on the Berensons’ intellectual world with over a dozen different scholars delivering papers on Berenson’s life and legacy. Also in October, I Tatti will complete a major renovation of one wing of the library, and next spring, a new building will open with studies for fellows as well as a small lecture room. While I Tatti is closed to the general public, Harvard affiliates can write in advance and make special arrangements to visit the villa and gardens.  —Staff writer Alexandra Perloff-Giles can be reached at aperloff@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When David L. Szanton ’60 arrived on the Harvard campus as a freshman in the fall of 1956, he found the school inhospitable to his passion for sculpture, literally. “There wasn’t any space at all for people interested in art,” he said. “There was nowhere we could work.” Studios were reserved for students studying architectural science; students who wanted to create were often forced to use their dorm rooms as ateliers. Frustrated with the lack of space, Szanton approached a dean who conceded a two-room apartment in Dudley House. There, Szanton and a dozen other students could paint and sculpt. The apartment was hardly set up as a studio, but, Szanton said, “there was nothing else on campus.”  
By the time Szanton graduated, the University had embarked upon two large-scale constructions to make room for the arts at Harvard—the Loeb Drama Center, begun in 1959 and completed in 1960 and the Carpenter Center, planned in 1959 and completed in 1963. These two projects, part of an overall plan to increase the presence of art on campus, gave student artists the space to thrive. But as the school built homes for the arts in brick and concrete, some students feared that creativity itself, under the University’s watch, would be rigidified. 
BUILDING CREATIVE SPACE
Both the Loeb Drama Center and the Carpenter Center stemmed from an administrative push to increase the presence of the arts on the Harvard Campus. “At the time, Harvard did not have much for actual, working, creative activity,” said Eduard F. Sekler, Osgood Hooker Professor of Visual Art, Emeritus and former co-director of the Carpenter Center.
Upon his arrival at Harvard, President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 took up an existing initiative to review the role of the arts within the University. He created a five-person visiting committee, chaired by John Nicholas Brown ’22, in order to investigate how the arts might become more integrated into Harvard’s education. 
The committee’s recommendations for Harvard, which came to be known as the Brown Report, were released in 1955 and stipulated a wide-ranging series of reforms. Comparing Harvard to a number of peer institutions, the committee developed specific plans for the school, from the small-scale name change of the Department of Art History to the ground-breaking call for an increased number of theater courses and a design department. These changes would “give the experience of art its rightful place in liberal education,” wrote Pusey in the report. To accompany the new curriculum, the committee proposed new classrooms—a “Design Center” and a “Theater.”
Within two years, the school had obtained funds for both projects. In June of 1957, New York investment broker James L. Loeb gave $1,000,000 for the future drama center; four months later Mr. and Mrs. Alfred St. Vrain Carpenter, owners of pear orchards in Oregon, gave $1,500,000 to “completely underwrite a Harvard Visual Arts Center,” according to the Crimson. Close in date, the two gifts were also close in their intent—the Carpenters had originally wanted to donate to the theater until their son, Harlow Carpenter ’50, a graduate of the Graduate School of Design, convinced them to direct the money toward the visual arts.
The report made clear that these changes were intended to increase the role of visual learning within the liberal arts curriculum, not turn Harvard into a trade school for future artists or actors. It also stressed visual literacy over practical skill, claiming that without “the twin arts of perception and discrimination” the educated man might be overly swayed by “photograph, the billboard, the cinema, the picture magazine, and now television.” 
“The idea,” Sekler said, “was that for Harvard undergraduates, it was as important to be visually literate as to be literate in language. We did not pretend that we were educating future artists. It is ridiculous to think that every undergraduate could become a professional.” 
This emphasis quelled the fears of those faculty members who were concerned that the school would become too pre-professional. “There was a lingering suspicion about teaching people the importance of practicing these arts as ways to gain knowledge of the world,” said Robert G. Gardner ’48, former Coordinator of Light and Communication and co-director of the Carpenter Center. Drama was subject to the same scrutiny. “Traditional faculty feared that this was the first step on the road to perdition,” said Joel F. Henning ’61, former President of the Harvard Dramatic Club.  
CURTAINS UP ON THE LOEB
Harvard theater was thriving when the Loeb took the stage. “There was theater all over the place and it was pretty damn good,” said Arthur L. Kopit ’59, a playwright and Tony Award winner.  Fourty-five plays had been performed in 1957 alone, productions ranging from student-written work to Shakespeare. Professional critics frequently visited from Boston to comment on current productions.
This theatrical work was entirely student driven. Students directed, acted and produced—with no supervision and little funding form the University. “Until the Loeb came into existence, we had to raise the money and rent the props. We had to pay to rent lighting and costumes. We had no support from the university, other than being allowed to use various physical facilities,” Henning said. 
The facilities, too, offered little more than room to act. The two existing performing spaces—the Agassiz Theater and Sanders Theater—were auditoriums rather than theaters. They lacked any mechanical support, such as lighting, for theatrical productions. Most plays happened in dining halls. “There was no technology,” Kopit said. “It was very primitive.”  
So when plans to build the Loeb got underway, it seemed that the Harvard theater scene would finally get exactly what it had been missing: a theater. The Loeb, designed by Hugh Stubbins, was to be a state of the art facility, technologically advanced and innovatively designed. The flexible main stage allowed for three different set-ups, an Elizabethan theater, a proscenium and a theater in the round. The experimental theater next door was exciting in its originality. 
The Drama Center was novel down to the details. “The Loeb was one of the first theaters in the country designed to have a black box theater,” said Henning. The lighting board would be computerized—something students had never seen before, said John D. Hancock ’61. “It was a very fine theater for its time,” Kopit said. 
CORBUSIER’S CONCRETE VISION
At the same time, the school was on the lookout for an architect to build the Design Center. Jose Luis Sert, Dean of the Graduate School of Design, suggested Le Corbusier, a Swiss-French architect. 
The choice was a bold one. By 1958, Le Corbusier had already established himself as one of the foremost architects of the 20th century. “There is no Corbusier building in this country, which is as strange as if there were no Picasso paintings in our museums,” Sert wrote in a letter. But the architect was not unequivocally loved. The Crimson called Le Corbusier “controversial” and wrote that the choice “dramatized the importance it attaches to the new Visual Arts Center in the most effective way possible.” “It was very admirable that Harvard picked him,” said Nicholas Fox Weber, author of “Le Corbusier: A Life.”
As it made a statement with its forward design, the Carpenter Center was also to provide the necessary space for students in the upcoming Visual Studies program. The building was filled with studios specifically designed for the working artist. The wide windows would provide a soft light for painting, shielded from direct sunlight by concrete breakers. In the exhibition space on the first floor, students could present their work and academics could teach by showing, Sekler described. “It’s the kind of studio space that any creative person can walk into and mess up the canvas and try things,” said Yoshiaki Shimizu ’63, now an art history professor at Princeton University. There was room to fool around. “The Carpenter Center,” said Szanton, “is 40 times the size of our two little rooms in Dudley House.”
With its distinctive design and bold concrete, the architecture was intended to tie the arts into the rest of the campus, according to Sekler. The long ramp passing through the building, a signature trait of Le Corbusier’s architecture, would allow the students to experience the building even as they walked to class, Sekler said. “‘Ramps connect, stairs divide’—it was one of his sayings,” Sekler said. 
THEN AND NOW
While these changes provided the long-needed room for artistic development at Harvard, undergraduates were wary that the school’s interest in student creativity would actually hamper it. “We were somewhat afraid that the interest in theater on the part of the university would lead to control and the marginalization of student directed shows. On the other hand, after working in Agassiz, who would not want a chance at those facilities that the Loeb offered?” said Julius L. Novick ’60, a long-time theater critic and Professor of Dramatic Studies.
Plays for the Loeb would have to be faculty approved, a bureaucratic barrier that students had not encountered before. “Once you had a major space that cost a lot of money, you had to have decision making on a faculty level,” Kopit said. Obtaining space in the Loeb depended on one’s relationship with faculty members, notably Robert Chapman, the director. 
“It was his facility,” explained Hancock. The Crimson complained that productions often arose from, “closed-session bargaining between the Faculty committee and certain favored undergraduates.”
As curricular changes tested educational approaches to artistic creativity, some students feared that the school’s commitment to a well-rounded education would compromise their ability to make art. “When an institution begins to encourage artistic activity, it encourages amateurs. If you really want to create, you do it on your own,” said Shimizu. 
Now, 50 years later, Harvard continues to wrestle with its uneasy relationship with the arts. The Task Force on the Arts, appointed in 2007, is a latterday incarnation of the Brown Report. Its task: to discover how Harvard may better nourish creative activity. As students and faculty discuss how the school might foster the arts, they revive a conversation decades old. “The fundamental issue then is what should the role of the arts be within the academy,” Hancock said. “It is still an issue today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Russian pianist Lev Vlasenko dazzled Harvard students with his smooth piano playing in a dimly lit Adams House Common room, the political tension between the virtuoso’s native USSR and the United States was hardly visible. At the informal concert, the students seemed to forget that their respective countries were at war and simply delighted in each other’s company. In 1959, when the Cold War was at its pinnacle, and the relationship between the U.S. and the USSR was frigid at best, a team of 12 Soviet delegates came to Harvard as part of a month long tour of American northeastern colleges in an effort to foster greater cultural understanding.The group constituted one of two assembled on the basis of geographical area and professional interest. While one group toured universities in the Northeast, the other toured those in the Midwest.The 12 visitors—eight men and four women—arrived in Cambridge, where they surveyed the Harvard campus, met with University administrators and students, and attended lectures and conferences. The delegates were selected in such a way as to guarantee representation of various facets of Soviet life. Among the members were Vlasenko, movie and stage actress Zinaida Kirienko, engineer Igor Markov, accordion player Vladimir Fedoseyev, and Elvira Astafyeva.While visiting the Harvard campus, the delegates lived in pairs at the Business School, Divinity School, Adams House, Kirkland House, Bertram Hall, and Comstock Hall.The group lost little time in visiting notable Cambridge and Boston locales.During their six and a half day stay, the delegates saw as much of Cambridge and Boston as possible—they visited John Hancock Building, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Commons, Widener Library and the Yard. In addition, smaller groups paid visits to hospitals, a reform school, Newton High School, and a Polaroid-Land factory. In addition, they met with Dean McGeorge Bundy to discuss American-Soviet student exchange programs, attended a closed luncheon in Quincy House, and strolled through Widener Library; the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Peabody Museums; and the Russian Research Center.The delegates noticed large differences between life in the U.S. and the USSR.“The tempo in the United States is very fast,” delegation leader Nikolai Voshchinin said at a news conference.Although U.S.-Soviet relations were the talk of the town, the delegates, who arrived in the wake of Premier Nikita Khrushchev’s U.S. visit, strayed from political discussion, focusing instead on cultural exchange, in what appeared to be an attempt to facilitate amicable and peaceful coexistence.Prior to Khrushchev’s first visit to the U.S. during the previous month, Soviets had been prohibited from leaving the USSR. The student exchange programs—such as those in which the student delegates participated—demonstrated that the iron curtain had, indeed, begun to fall.In fact, 1959 was also the first year that the U.S. was allowed to host a trade and cultural fair in the Russian capital. However, the fact that the way in which the countries chose their delegation participants differed suggested that political tension and strong feelings of ideological superiority hadn’t ceased to exist. While American delegates were chosen on the basis of academic merit, the Soviet delegates were chosen largely on the basis of their allegiance to the USSR and ability to champion Soviet political ideals, according to former Davis Center for Eurasian Studies Associate Director Professor Marshall I. Goldman. “The University went out of its way to insist that participants in the exchange did not have anything to do with the CIA or the State Department,” Marshall said, adding that the Russian government used U.S.-USSR exchange programs as opportunities to spread propaganda.Notwithstanding, the Russian delegates received a hearty welcome in Cambridge—their first stop in their month-long voyage along the northeastern U.S., with stops including Penn Yan, N.Y., Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City.Partly due to the success of the delegation’s visit, such exchanges became more frequent, allowing for greater understanding between the two countries, according to the delegation’s interpreter, Edward W. Keane ’57.Fifty years later, tension between the former USSR and the U.S. has largely subsided, and Harvard’s Davis Center for Eurasian Studies and the College’s Born in the USSR club actively encourage students to pursue Russian studies or seek out exposure to Russian culture. The Davis Center not only provides financial support to student internships and research in Russia and the CIS countries, but also hosts a variety of conferences and seminars.In addition, Harvard’s Born in the USSR club organizes events, such as Russian poetry readings, movie and game nights, and Russian tables. The purpose of all these activities is to increase Russian cultural awareness among both Russians and Americans, according to active BUSSR participant and honorary board member Alla Azrilyan.—Staff writer Marianna N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard was gearing up for another battle with the City of Cambridge. On one side, President Nathan M. Pusey ’28, pushing his Program for Harvard College—an $85 million campaign to up the number of undergraduate Houses from seven to 10—sought to acquire a stretch of prime river-front property owned by the Massachusetts Transit Authority. But from his corner of City Hall, Councillor Alfred “Big Al” E. Vellucci moved to block tax-exempt Harvard’s expansion, hoping instead that private investors would develop the land and augment the city’s coffers.But before either party could have its way, the MTA (now called the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) would have to agree to sell its 12 acres west of Kirkland and Eliot Houses near the Charles River. Called the Bennett Street Yards, the lot was the only facility for maintenance and repairs on the entire subway system. But it occupied some of the most valuable land in Massachussets.Beginning in 1955, the University entered negotiations to buy the yards. In 1959, after four years of inconclusive talks, the University escalated its bid to acquire the Bennett Street Yards. But few then could have imagined what the yards would ultimately become.GRABBING FOR LANDFor decades, land in Cambridge had been in high demand, so much so that even as Harvard and the MTA negotiated, a bill came before the Massachussetts state legislature proposing the construction of a 40-acre platform over the Charles River Basin near MIT, which would provide space for “apartments, research firms, or other industrial buildings”—and  would expand the tax base for the City.The land’s desirability meant that Cambridge real estate tended to carry a hefty price tag. In 1959, Harvard offered to pay around $4 million, or the equivalent of $5 per square foot, plus an additional $1 million for the property. University officials said at the time that the extra million dollars—the equivalent of $7 million today—was intended to help the MTA relocate its switching yards, which was required in order for the transportation authority to sell its land.There was some concern that the University would not actually be able to pay the amount it had promsed, according to Bruce L. Paisner ’64, who covered the ongoing negotiation over the Bennet Street Yards for The Crimson.Taxed land in Cambridge also brings along a lot of revenue for the city. The possibility of losing even more land to the tax-exempt University didn’t sit well with some Cambridge and Massachussetts government officials. The MTA did not pay taxes on the land, but there were some bidders who would.In 1959, in addition to Harvard’s offer, a group of Philadelphia insurance companies told the Cambridge City Council that they, in conjunction with Cambridge realtor Rodney W. Long ’22, wanted to acquire the MTA land in order to construct a $50 million apartment complex on the yards.BATTLING ‘BIG AL’Vellucci was a major opponent of the University’s land buying plans and supported Long’s effort to acquire the MTA land.“Big Al Velluci: he enjoyed pulling Harvard’s nose, and he was great at it,” said Frederick W. Byron ’59, who also reported on the Bennett Street Yard acquisition controversy for The Crimson.Vellucci went on to serve three terms as mayor of Cambridge in the 1970s and 1980s. He made a name for himself by demanding that Harvard make a “payment in lieu of taxes.” In February of 1959, the Cambridge City Council had considered, but ultimately voted down, an order proposed by Vellucci that would require the MTA to notify the body of any plans to sell land in Cambridge.Commenting on the order in 1959, Councillor Pearl K. Wise said, “It seems to me that Harvard is not entitled to two more Houses facing the river.”But other councillors, including Harvard graduates Edward A. Crane ’35 and Joseph A. DeGuglielmo ’29, defended the university’s efforts to acquire more land, citing the university’s “stabilizing effect” on the city’s economy due to its role as a major employer.PROFILES IN CAMBRIDGEThe class of 1959 graduated without seeing a decision on the MTA yards. In 1959 the first of the Program for Harvard College Houses, Quincy, opened. Although the University continued its efforts to acquire the MTA land fo the next seven years, the reasons for buying the land changed dramatically.“The turning point came in 1962,” Paisner, the reporter, said, “John F. Kennedy was the president. He came up to a football game [in Cambridge]...He saw the MTA yards and said ‘Aha! That would be nice spot for a library.’”From that point on, according to Paisner, the University abandoned any lingering plans to build Houses on the Bennett Street Yards and redirected its efforts to helping bring Kennedy’s presidential library to the site. But they were ultimately unsuccessful; Kennedy’s library was built instead at Columbia Point in Boston.In the fall of 1963, when the MTA finally found a new location for its carbarns in Dorchester’s Codman Square, Pusey announced that the University was no longer interested in building a House on the Bennett Street site.And by 1964, the MTA announced that it was  willing to sell the yards. In 1966 Harvard finally bought the land and made plans to relocate its Graduate School of Public Administration—renamed for President Kennedy—on the site.—Staff writer Sarah J.

On October 4, 1957, a lonely rocket climbed skyward, slipped those so-called “surly bonds of earth,” and left the desolate Kazakh plain behind. That rocket carried Sputnik, the first satellite launched into space, and the simple beeping signal it beamed back to Earth reverberated through radio receivers into the most distant halls of power, marking the beginning of the space race and sending U.S. policy makers scrambling to close the gap between the United States and Soviet Russia.Consequences of the Soviet launch would not, however, stay within Washington—the resulting effort to catch up to the Soviets would engage the nation and drag Harvard into an odd marriage of progressive initiatives and Cold War politics.The U.S. public and government perceived the Soviet victory in sending the first satellite into space as more than just a failure of its space agency and, instead, a failure of U.S. educational institutions to produce adequate numbers of scientists and engineers to contend with the Soviet engineering corps. Passed in 1958, the National Defense and Education Act aimed to mitigate that gap by providing funding to universities, including cash for student financial aid, but in a hold-over of McCarthy era fears, the act required student recipients to swear a loyalty oath and sign a loyalty affidavit to the United States and its Constitution.‘A VERY UNCONSCIOUS TIME’The radicalism of the 1960s was not brewing at Harvard in 1959. Throughout 1959 headlines announcing steps to pressure Congress to remove the loyalty oath from the NDEA dominated The Crimson, yet College students present at the time consistently say that the loyalty oaths were not considered a pressing issue and concerned few.Most students, in fact, considered themselves apolitical at the time and were more concerned about gaining financially rewarding and prestigious jobs associated with a Harvard education.“I think it was a very unconscious time—the country was unconscious—just imagine Joe McCarthy!” said William H.C. Basetti ’59. “But at Harvard at least everybody who had the least speck of brains realized how stupid it was.”Harvard’s involvement with the Roosevelt administration’s war effort had created a precedent for government involvement on campus, and given that the country had not yet experienced the disillusionment induced by the Vietnam War, most students were willing to trust the government to an extent not seen today and less willing to speak out, said Charles C. Ashley ’59.When a student council committee issued a scathing report criticizing the loyalty oaths, the council disbanded the committee and formed a new committee to rewrite the report in a gentler tone.“It was some kind of outraged response that seemed a bit over the top to most of us on the student council at the time—like hitting a small question with a big hammer,” said council-member Abe F. Lowenthal ’61, now a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.Whether students were outraged at the idea of loyalty oaths or not, the political and social climate at the time seems to have stifled any potential engagement—students simply had other priorities.“There was not a great deal of [political] activity at the time of my graduation,” said John F. Dobbyn ’59, a law professor at Vanderbilt.OUTRAGE AT THE TOPOpposition to administering loyalty oaths to students centered at the highest levels of the University and focused on eliminating the loyalty affidavit—the most legally binding part of the oaths—but rarely trickled down to the student level.Dean of the College John U. Monro ’34 called the loyalty oaths “180 degrees out of phase with what we are trying to do here.”“Our method of education is not the method of oaths or the method of restriction of belief,” he said. “We depend on free—not inhibited—inquiry.”Students at the college during the height of the controversy said that most students were unaware or unconcerned with the NDEA and declined to participate in the kind of activism one associates with college politics today and in the decade after the passage of the NDEA.“If there were 50 people who were taking strong positions that would have been a lot,” Ashley said. “The students were apolitical.”As the debate over loyalty oaths reached a fever pitch during the early fall of ’59, administrators reluctantly participated in the program with the hope that a bill championed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy ’40 would remove the loyalty affidavit from the act, making acceptance of federal funds more palatable to the University.But when that bill stalled on the Senate floor and was sent back to committee, University officials and faculty hardened in their opposition to the bill.After months of discussion over the NDEA culminated in a flurry of reports by faculty bodies urging the University  not to participate in the financial aid program, the Harvard Corporation voted to reject about 350,000 in federal funding—2.6 million in today’s dollars.Among the faculty, Law School Professor Mark DeWolfe Howe ’28 emerged as a vociferous critic of the act, asking during a debate with a supporter of the NDEA, “Can the federal government dictate the terms of education as the result of an infernal inheritance from Senator Joe McCarthy?”Yet to a certain extent that conservatism remained an indelible aspect of American culture at the time.—Staff writer Elias J.

In 1959, Elizabeth H. Carleton ’59 would become the last woman ever to be crowned “Miss Radcliffe.” That year, the annual beauty contest—judged by Harvard professors who would watch the girls read aloud a provided passage—came under scrutiny as two of the nine Radcliffe dorms refused to enter candidates in the contest in protest, claiming it was “against Radcliffe principles.”The winner was to be featured in a Glamour magazine spread featuring 10 of the best-dressed college women in the United States. In addition to the spread, the winner would receive a lifetime pass to the Brattle Street Theatre and a stuffed bunny rabbit.Though Moors and Barnard dormitories unanimously voted to boycott the contest—whose competition standards included “good grooming—not just neat, but impeccable”—the competition went on. Cabot and Holmes were the only dormitories that did not express any qualms about the competition, according to a Feb. 14, 1959 Crimson article.Carleton said that she had no idea that some dormitories had refused to participate in the pageant, but she did remember a “cute” girl in the dorm who did not want to get involved. She was aware that there was some controversy involved—she used to joke that the competition was canceled because she was so ugly that she had scared everyone out of ever wanting to have another one again.Carleton said that, although this was a beauty contest, it had nothing to do with bathing suits.“It was very civilized,” she said. “I think they were looking for sophistication—whether you were able to meet a professor and treat him well.”Although some students’ reactions to the beauty pageant seem to indicate a challenge to traditional gender conventions, the protest was far from radical. But such action was not limited to the pageant. In 1959, Radcliffe women would start to quietly question norms of domesticity through similarly muted means—and the Radcliffe they knew, and the world they lived in during their undergraduate years—would soon become a vestige of a bygone era.BEGINNING TO BEND THE RULESOver a dozen members of the Radcliffe class of 1959 said that though they realized there were gender disparities, none said they felt seriously disenfranchised at the time. Many pointed out that the women’s movement was far removed from their college experience.Still, some women imbued nontraditional motives into traditional practices in order to gain independence from Radcliffe’s restrictive rules and mores.In addition to the beauty pageant, in 1959, only Radcliffe women had curfews and dining hall chores. Women were not allowed to wear pants in the evenings below the second floor of their dormitories. They were also supervised by a number of “house mothers.”Few of these house mothers had advanced degrees, as opposed to Harvard’s academically focused tutors.“Our house mother was wonderful and sweet,” Mary C. Swope ’59 (originally Mary G. Carlton) said. “We got milk and cookies if we weren’t going out on the weekends.”Though the school’s parietal rules could limit participation in late night extracurricular activities, some women were able to use the curfew to their advantage.“As freshmen, we were allowed to go out something like 21 times until 1:00 a.m. for the first semester,” Jean P. McNeal ’59 (originally Jean F. Pulis) said. “You may think that is terrible but you could turn it into a game. If you really didn’t like the guy, you could say you had to be home by 10 p.m.”Swope, who was an editor on the Advocate, remembers that the women on the publication were often prevented from voting on submissions because of Radcliffe’s curfew.“There was discrimination imposed by the [University] administration because we had to be out of the Advocate office by 10 o’clock,” she said “it was just another indication that women weren’t taken as seriously.”In order to mitigate strict institutional constraints from the University and their parents, several Radcliffe students used one of the only outs from traditional campus life available at the time: marriage.Roberta S. Karmel ’59 married at the end of her sophomore year and moved off campus to Back Bay, describing the process as “quite liberating.”“Getting married was a way to get more independence in your personal life,” she says.Moving off campus with her husband freed Karmel from many of the social restraints imposed by the house mothers and her parents.“Whatever my husband and I decided, that’s what we did—I didn’t have to ask my parents,” she said.However, Karmel’s move was within the confines of her generation. “You were passed from your father’s care to your husband’s care,” she said. DEFYING CONVENTIONSAlthough only a handful of women entered male-dominated professions directly after Radcliffe, those who did quietly defied conventional attitudes and dealt with a lack of female role models which they say initially limited their professional aspirations.Suzanne W. Sabath ’59 (originally Suzanne R. Wells), who initially concentrated in music, says that most of her classes were with men. Though she says the courses were coeducational, there were subtle gender barriers that ultimately convinced her to leave the concentration for the English department.Sabath says her music teachers periodically discouraged her from pursuing a career in music, claiming that the field was not appropriate for women.Yet she claims that even faced with such treatment, women’s issues were not on her mind when she was at Radcliffe.“At Radcliffe, I didn’t have these feelings, and I’m not sure anyone else did because we didn’t discuss it,” she said. “Women were not allowed in Lamont Library, and we just never even thought about how ridiculous that was.”Long after Radcliffe, Sabath became heavily involved in the abortion rights activism, presiding over a Massachusetts organization which frequently organized demonstrations on the Boston Common. Karmel, who said she does not remember a blatant de jure gender divide, says the dearth of females among the Harvard faculty discouraged her from pursuing a Ph.D. She says she thought it would be “practically impossible for a woman to be hired as an academic at an ivy league institution.”“It was a sign of the times. Most of us generally accepted the discrimination that existed,” she said.McNeal, who studied biochemical sciences as an undergraduate, said that in the male dominated department, the concentration’s women missed out on a camaraderie shared by the men. In some classes, there were three or four girls in a class of over 200. McNeal’s thesis adviser, Carroll Williams, regularly held afternoon teas often frequented by noted scientists such as James Watson. However McNeal, as the resident female, was always in charge of making the tea for the others. Though McNeal thought she could find employment in the sciences, almost no recruiters visited Radcliffe’s campus. “They would come to Harvard, but we didn’t have access to it,” she said.She said that especially in the sciences—where the proportions of females were so small—it wasn’t worth the recruiters’ time to draft from a pool of only a handful of females. According to Sabath, there was “zero recruiting of any sort” and there were only a handful of women who went directly to professional school.“Most of the women were interested in getting married or teaching,” she said. “That was about it.”THE DAWNING OF A NEW ERAIn 1959, Radcliffe announced the selection of its fifth president, Mary I. Bunting, a microbiologist and a widow with four children.Though Bunting’s power was far eclipsed by then-University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28, Bunting oversaw the final integration of Radcliffe and Harvard and subtly changed Radcliffe’s culture of domesticity. She actively encouraged women to enter the professional world and established the Bunting Institute, designed to encourage the higher education of women.And though members of the class of 1959 did not directly interact with Bunting during her presidency, many said that her installation was a sign that the age of provincialism was slowly drawing to a close.McNeal said that Bunting—who was a mother and a professional—spurred the change that would eventually come to Radcliffe.McNeal said that Bunting seemed committed to the women students and making their professional lives meaningful. “I think she gave credibility to us,” McNeal said. “She brought us a seat at the table with Harvard.”—Crimson staff writer Brittany M.

As Jeremiah P. Ostriker ’59 walked from Matthews Hall to the Freshman Union for breakfast, he would sprinkle radish seeds alongside the pathways of Harvard Yard. His freshman year roommate Ethan D. Bolker ’59 said that Ostriker—now a Princeton professor and noted astrophysicist—was curious to see if the plants would grow. Sure enough, when the grass began to blossom in the spring of 1956, it was dotted with radishes. “He’s always had a sense of humor about him,” said his daughter Eve C. Ostriker ’87.Ostriker—who worked as Princeton’s provost from 1995 to 2001—has since shown that he is a self-teacher who friends say is both curious and adventurous in his academic and personal lives. The son of a teacher and a businessman, Ostriker was born and raised in Manhattan. He attended the Fieldston School, but said that in both high school and college he learned more from reading on his own than he did from most of his courses.“I probably got more out of sports in high school than I did out of classes,” Ostriker said. At Harvard, Ostriker studied physics and chemistry, and his high school classmate and Kirkland House roommate Robert H. Socolow ’59 said Ostriker “wasn’t a guy who had a telescope and spent hours looking at the stars.”Ostriker said that his most memorable class was not a science course, but a class on poetry with modernist poet Archibald MacLeish. He said he enjoyed the chance to figure out what questions to ask about the poems, a challenge he didn’t find in his science classes.In addition to his studies, Ostriker said he had “quite a bit of fun” in college, and Socolow remembered that empty vodka bottles lined the mantle in the room he shared with Ostriker and Robert B. Strassler ’59. Socolow, who is also currently a professor at Princeton, called his long-time friend “adventurous and intense.”He recalled one instance in which Ostriker tried to walk across the barely-frozen Charles River.“He made it,” Socolow said. “He didn’t come in wet.”Bolker remembered that Ostriker rode a Vespa back to school from New York City after their freshman summer. Ostriker also used his Vespa to travel to Brandeis to visit his future wife, Alicia Suskin Ostriker. Ostriker was still an undergraduate when the couple was married by a Justice of the Peace in Somerville, Mass. in November 1959.After leaving Harvard, Ostriker earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago then spent a year as a post-doc at Cambridge University. While at Cambridge, Ostriker worked with the likes of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and current president of the Royal Society Martin Rees.“I said to my wife, ‘Gee they all seem very clever over here, but I subsequently realized that it was a very special time,” Ostriker said.From Cambridge he moved to Princeton University, where he spent 16 years as the chairman of the Department of Astrophysical Sciences. Ostriker is particularly noted for his research on dark matter, the hypothetical matter whose presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter.Ostriker’s daughter remembered that her father was always very excited about his work and said that he loved working with students.During the years Ostriker served as Princeton’s provost, he oversaw the University’s push to reduce student loans, an achievement he took pride in, according to both Socolow and Ostriker’s daughter.After stepping down from his post in 2001 upon Shirley M. Tilghman’s selection as Princeton’s president, Ostriker returned to Cambridge University to assume the prestigious position of the Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy.He returned to Princeton in 2005, and last year was elected the treasurer of the National Academy of Sciences.“That he was going to be a good scientist was evident in college,” Socolow said, “but that he was going to be a talented administrator was not.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

In 1972 he was arrested at an anti-war protest. He has been called a Marxist and a radical.  But in 1968 Stephen A. Marglin ’59 was one of the youngest professors to ever be granted tenure. Today, he is the last of a dying breed—the radical Harvard economics professor.On the Harvard campus and within the economics faculty, Marglin emerged as a prominent leftist economist with the publishing of his seminal critique of neoclassical economics, “What Do Bosses Do?”, and by pushing for an alternative to Social Analysis 10, or Ec 10, that would present competing views to orthodox economics.But Marglin, who has even challenged the assumptions of capitalism as too Western-centric and critiqued its hierarchical nature, emerged from anything but a radical time and place—late 1950s Harvard.Marglin describes the Harvard of his undergraduate years as a place that accepted the “established order” and was unwilling to contemplate its de facto all-white, gender segregated character—a place dominated by the children of elite prep schools and suffused with Cold War politics.At a dinner for national honors society Phi Beta Kappa graduates at the Signet Society, an official from the Eisenhower administration had been recruited to give the after-dinner speech. He addressed the importance of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways as a crucial component of national defense.Marglin said he stood up to ask a question.“Why does everything we do for a good reason have to be in the name of defense?”According to Marglin, the official was taken aback.Though the remarks may have presaged his later stances, Marglin hardly emerged from Harvard a radical—at graduation he was a neoclassical economist, concerned with the optimization of limited resources and, as such, apolitical.As an undergraduate, Marglin was not a cafe-dwelling, revolutionary intellectual; rather, he was a Jewish public school kid from California who worried about looking like and fitting in with East Coast private school kids.In those days, the schools of thought that ushered in 60s radicalism and Marglin’s own left-ward turn—feminism, the anti-nuclear and anti-war movements, and the sexual revolution—were nascent as ideologies.Students at Harvard during the late 50s consistently said that political engagement on campus was virtually nonexistent, with students expressing more concern over the closing of the popular bar Cronin’s to make room for the Holyoke Center than the  absence of black students on campus, male-female segregation, or lingering anti-Semitism.But Marglin would make a drastic departure from the depoliticized environment of the late 50s to marry his economics with a radical brand of politics.A self-avowed “pink-diaper,” Marglin said his left-wing politics stemmed from his parents—moderate leftists in their own right.But not until a research trip to India in the mid 60s, did Marglin politicize his economics. Marglin said that his so-called radicalization was a gradual progression that lacked definite turning points.But in India, Marglin came as close as he ever would to such a moment.Teaching math-savvy Indian grad students basic macroeconomics, Marglin found his students nonplussed by the economic theory despite their deep understanding of the mathematics. That realization in India propelled Marglin towards a leftist economic career that would challenge the Western-centric assumptions behind orthodox economic theory.Not until Marglin left Harvard did he accomplish this leftward turn. The Harvard of his undergraduate years, he said, would never have allowed it.“There was a powerlessness in the exact sense that there was an established order and one had to live with it,” Marglin said. “It was a powerlessness that we could live with because we were all privileged.”—Staff writer Elias J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bryce E. Nelson ’59 took a year to muster the courage to go out for the editorial board of The Crimson.  
“I left Harvard on the day of the Harvard-Yale game and I could hear the cheers in the crowd—I felt like Charlie Chaplin with my knapsack on my back,” he said of the day he left to study for a year at the University of Utah. After writing for the daily newspaper at Utah, Nelson returned to triumphantly attain a spot on the Editorial Board. Two years later, he was elected president.
As President, Nelson drew the attention of the campus to important events as he saw them from what his Adams housemate and Oxford classmate Robert C. Darnton ’60 called his “observation post” as President of The Crimson.
For Nelson, The Crimson proved a launching pad for his future career. Though he entered the College with hardly an inclination toward journalism, Nelson wound up devoting most of his life to just that, becoming an award-winning journalist and, eventually, teaching his craft as the head of USC’s Annenberg School of Communication.    
Nelson strove to keep students informed and involved in campus events, using the newspaper to create what he calls “a center of discussion in that pre-internet age.” The crest of controversy during his tenure came with The Crimson’s coverage of Reverend George A. Buttrick’s refusal to allow Jewish services in Memorial Church. The Crimson ran a letter from Univeristy President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 supporting the Reverend’s decision, as well as editorials disapproving of Pusey and Butrick’s stance. In the end, the Corporation overruled Pusey. 
Though a Social Relations and History concentrator at the time, Nelson now says his identity is “largely shaped by being a journalist”—a change that dates to his college years. 
“If it hadn’t been for the Crimson I probably wouldn’t have gone into journalism,” Nelson said. “I devoted all my life to it beside the minor amount of time I spent studying.”
Nelson said that he was influenced to go into the field by former editors like David Halberstam ’55 and Anthony Lewis ’48 who became Pulitzer Prize winning journalists. Former editors also inspired Nelson to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship. After receiving the scholarship, Nelson went on to attain an M. Phil in politics from Oxford. He began his career after graduate school as an instructor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh before moving to Washington D.C. to report on Congressional and foreign affairs for the Washington Post.  
Before accepting an offer as the head of the Annenberg School of Communication at USC, Nelson worked prolifically as a journalist writing for newspapers including New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Science magazine, and the Washington Post. His most notable pieces include a series of articles for Science magazine that helped to eliminate government blacklisting on advising panels, winning him the Albert Deutsch Award; and a series on chemical poisoning in America that landed him a spot as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. 
But Nelson said his most well known achievements are not necessarily those he deems his most influential. One of the pieces he is most proud of was his front page New York Times editorial coverage of the 1971 Attica Prison uprising. He also wrote speeches for Senator Frank Church of Idaho, one of the first senators to speak up against the war in Vietnam.
“In journalism you aren’t going to affect the world greatly every week or every month,” Nelson said, “But if you can do it a few times than it makes your work worthwhile.”
In 1984, Nelson left the New York Times, where Darnton says that he expected Nelson to become Editor-in-Chief, to head the USC School of Journalism, which would later become the Annenberg School. Nelson said he found teaching “more rewarding than any bureaucratic tasks.” 
“I’ve noticed… an evolution of this bright young man from the back-country who cut a wide swath through Harvard, had a superb career as a journalist and wound up as a professor like so many of us,” Darnton said.
His former students, who themselves comprise a formidable list of the country’s top journalists, attribute their success to Nelson, whom CNN Anchor Kyra Philips called “not only a fantastic professor but a true friend.”
“Bryce is sort of the quintessential intellectual yet funny professor, he just looks like a professor yet he has a very accessible quality about him that really endears him to all of his students,” said Fox News correspondent and former student Anita Vogel. 
But while endearing, there is something shrewder that lies behind Nelson’s knowing smile. 
“He has a very sharp eye for pomposity and mendacity and pretense,” said John Womack ’59, Professor of Latin-American History and Economics. “He has a very friendly but sharp way of making it clear that stuff like that is laughable.”
Philips agrees, “You better know what the hell you are talking about in front of Bryce.”

Nelson" incorrectly stated that Nelson became head of the Annenberg School of Communication at USC in 1984. In fact, when Nelson first jointed the school, it was called the USC School of Journalism, and was only later renamed the Annenberg School. The text of the article online has been updated to reflect this clarification.

The opening scene of Daniel Walker Howe ’59’s Pulitzer Prize winning history, “What Hath God Wrought,” artistically depicts the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, which pitted British regulars against a heterogeneous American force. The “Americans” hailed from Louisiana, Haiti, Kentucky, encompassing crack Irish-American units, freed slaves, and wary Native Americans. Orders were translated into Spanish, French, and Choctaw.The diverse internationalism of such a scene must have particularly piqued the interest of Howe, Harvard graduate and Professor Emeritus of both Oxford and UCLA, who once dreamed of ancient overseas battles as a young boy growing up in Denver. “I got interested in history when I was about six years old and my father sat me on his lap and told me about Hannibal crossing the Alps with elephants to fight the Romans,” Howe said. “I thought this was the most fascinating stuff imaginable.”Coming from Denver to Harvard was, in those days, still vaguely unusual: Denver was remote and provincial, far from the colorful melting pots of 19th century New Orleans, or ancient Rome. His storytelling father, a newspaperman, died when Howe was eight years old, widowing his mother and making money scarce. It was only a National Scholarship from Harvard that allowed Howe to afford an Ivy League education. Recalling his early days of transition between Denver and Harvard, Howe interrupts himself to say, “By the way, in those days transportation meant the train,” he said, “It was a night between Denver and Chicago and then another between Chicago and South Station where the train came in early in the morning. So this is a different world.” It was a different world, a slower world, one that is closer perhaps to the world that Howe wrote about in “What Hath God Wrought” than to the modern era. The book covers the period between 1815 and 1848. Its popularity is remarkable because, as Susan Ferber, acquisitions editor for the Oxford History of the United States series, wrote in an email to The Crimson, “It’s not an obvious period for many, since it doesn’t cover the American Revolution or Civil War or World War II. Instead,” she said, “it brings together a great many events, such as the War of 1812, technology and communications, party politics, literature and art, and the rise of many different religious groups.” These broad topics, far from the realm of traditional history, reflect Howe’s desire to write for the general public—to tell a story rather than speak in generalizations. “I hoped to make history as interesting for other people as I’ve always found it to be,” Howe said.Such storytelling and history reflects Howe’s days at Harvard, where he was a History and Literature concentrator: good preparation for his later career as a history professor, as he would later find out: “When I was teaching at UCLA, I became aware that the UCLA history department had a lot of people in it who’d been to Harvard, but the surprising part was how many of us had concentrated in Hist and Lit,” Howe said. Though he had never published work that deviated so far from traditional academic norms, Howe had always cherished a sort of Hist and Lit version of history—in lecture courses at UCLA, Howe was known to relive his Harvard Glee Club days by personally demonstrating hymns, when appropriate.Even the day of perhaps his greatest academic achievement—the day when the 2008 Pulitzer prizes were announced—Howe continued his fascination with historical storytelling. As though he were writing a story—as if he wanted the climax to come at the very end—he wrote in a note to his wife: “Meet me at 6 in the St. Alban’s parking lot.” “P.S. I won the Pulitzer.” —Staff writer Mark J. Chiusano can be reached at chiusano@fas.harvard.

Fifty years after graduating, David S. Rosenthal ’59 still spends his weekdays in the Square, decorates his walls with Harvard posters, and regularly eats lunch with College students.But now instead of finishing his math problem sets, he bides his time in the Holyoke Center working as the director of Harvard University Health Services.When Rosenthal first moved into Harvard Yard, he was unsure if he wanted to be a doctor at all. It would take the death of a close friend to convince Rosenthal to pursue a career in medicine.Instead, upon moving into his Thayer Hall residence, Rosenthal imagined himself becoming a teacher after graduation.Sylvester Sterioff, Jr. ’59, Rosenthal’s freshman year roommate—who is now a doctor—does not recall talking about medicine with Rosenthal while the two lived together in Thayer.Instead, he recalls Rosenthal’s excellence in academics and in track as a hurdler, and describes Rosenthal as an “extremely good student [who was] very serious about his education.”As Rosenthal took and enjoyed premed courses like Organic Chemistry, he still found it hard to let go of the idea of becoming a teacher. His father was a high school science teacher, and Rosenthal was tempted to follow in his father’s footsteps.But in Rosenthal’s junior year, his close friend William L. Dowling, Jr. ’59 died of leukemia.Dowling and Rosenthal lived one entryway apart in Dunster House.“In retrospect, it was one of the most significant events that probably focused me on what I wanted to do in life,” Rosenthal said of Dowling’s death.The experience inspired Rosenthal to pursue medicine. He even chose to specialize in hematology, the study of blood diseases like leukemia. Rosenthal always stayed close to Harvard. He attended Tufts Medical School, worked at hospitals in the Boston area, and then, in 1982, returned to Harvard to teach at the Medical School.Barbara J. McNeil, head of the department of health care policy at the Medical School, was a member of the search committee that selected Rosenthal as director of UHS.“The attractive features about him when we hired him certainly worked out to be true,” McNeil said. “He’s an excellent doctor clinically, he’s a very caring person, he has great communication skills, and he’s very interested in the students.” As director of UHS, Rosenthal oversees its daily workings and must also respond quickly to epidemics. In April, Rosenthal was involved in closing the Harvard School of Dental Medicine after a dental student was suspected to have swine flu.“He’s been able to do so many things as a physician, all the things that he’s really good at,” Rosenthal’s daughter Laura Hrasky said.Rosenthal’s career also reaches far beyond Harvard’s walls.He was the President of the American Cancer Society in 1998 and remains involved with the organization.Rosenthal has also been the medical director of the Zakim Center for Integrated Therapies at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.Despite his involvement in other institutions, friends and family say Rosenthal’s passion for Harvard stands out.Hrasky recalls attending Harvard sports games during her childhood and says her father speaks about the University often.In Rosenthal’s office, two Harvard posters hang on the walls, and he keeps his yearbook easily accessible on an office bookshelf.As he flips through the yearbook, he murmurs, “Good memories.”—Staff writer Danielle J.

Lady Marina A.S. Vaizey ’59 did not plan on becoming an art critic—after all when she went to Radcliffe College, she only took one class on art and graduated a Medieval History and Literature concentrator. She kind of fell into the profession.“I became an art critic through a series of accidents and coincidences,” said Vaizey, now a celebrated art critic who has written for the British newspapers, the Financial Times and the Sunday Times.The Radcliffe alumna says her career started in an Oxford gallery, when its proprietor suggested that she write about the exhibit.“I always knew I would do something,” she said. “This just happened and it just snowballed from there.”Vaizey spent a few years working for smaller publications and was eventually picked up by the Financial Times in 1970. While at the Times, she had the opportunity to find undiscovered artists. But she did not pride herself primarily in her ability to find fresh talent.“I would hear anecdotally that many more people would come in when a review was published,” she said. “I felt that my job was to get people to go in for themselves.”Vaizey, who was born January 16, 1938 in New York, attended the Brearley School in New York then the Putney School. A 1959 Radcliffe College graduate, Vaizey, who pointed to numerous classes that she enjoyed, called Harvard sometimes “overwelming.”“I slightly regretted not going to Swarthmore,” she said. “Even though I am a very old lady I can remember that.”She later attended Girton College at Cambridge University, according to the British Who’s Who Magazine. There she met her husband Lord John Vaizey in England “through friends of friends,” she said. He was a “preeminent Englishmen,” according to Elaine G. Yaffe ’59, a friend of Lady Vaizey’s since they were seven.They married in 1961 and had three children in 1961, 1964, and 1968. One of her children, Edward Vaizey, is now a Conservative member of Parliament.Marina Vaizey has lived in the same house in the West London suburb of Chiswick for 42 years. Her husband died in 1984.“He died tragically very young,” Yaffe said. Vaizey did not remarry.According to Yaffe, Vaizey told her that she “never met anyone quite like John.”After working for the Financial Times, Vaizey moved on to the Sunday Times in 1974. Meanwhile, she worked in what she called “a parallel career,” serving on the Arts Council of England and for other arts organizations. She also wrote several art books including “Great Women Collectors,” which she co-authored with Charlotte Gere.The Queen of England honored Vaizey by naming her a Commander of the British Empire, two levels below knighthood.Mary C. Swope ’59, a classmate and friend of Vaizey’s, said she thought Vaizey was “very pleased” about being honored, but their conversation about the award focused more on what Vaizey would wear to the palace.Swope described her friend—who she first met at Brearly—as a “unique personality” and a “good communicator.”“She was always very observant and she always had her own opinion,” she said. “She always had her own vision, her own way of looking.”While Vaizey likes to wear jewellery made by up-and-coming crafts people, according to Swope, art collection is not her passion.“I don’t think she’s mainly a collector. I think she’s a communicator, a thinker, and a writer,” she said.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 1959, 230 hand-selected Harvard men moved into Quincy House as the original occupants of the College’s first contemporary residence. Breaking with the architectural tradition of the initial seven Houses, Quincy’s concrete, high-rise exterior and novelty imbued its initial inhabitants with the freedom to build an interior House character from the ground up. As one of Quincy’s original 150 sophomores, Robert J. Gordon ’62 recalls the sense of pomp and privilege surrounding the newly-constructed eighth House.  “In Quincy, we were proud of our modern, posh surroundings and thought that we were destined to become the conceited house in 1959,” said Gordon. An October 12, 1959 correspondence between Gordon and his parents captures his sentiments towards his new residence. “I’m not talking about the spirits we drank—the ‘God-damn-if-Harvard-isn’t-the-best-place-in-the-whole-world-and-Quincy-House-in-particular’ spirit,” Gordon wrote. In both blueprints and character, Quincy House distinguished itself from the traditions etched in the walls of its ivy-clad counterparts.   HIGH-RISE REALITYPrior to Quincy’s construction fifty years ago, 1,200 additional students were living in Harvard undergraduate housing above the number the dorms were built to accommodate. In response to the deepening housing shortage in 1957, President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 announced the start of ‘A Program for Harvard College,’ an effort that resulted in three additions to the undergraduate residential structure: Quincy House in 1959, Leverett Towers in 1960, and Mather House in 1970. To solve the problem of over-crowding, a central initiative of his administration, Pusey called for an active fundraising drive by the alumni to address the growing needs of the College. Pusey’s capital campaign to raise $82.5 million, the equivalent of $287.5 million today, marked the most extensive fundraising campaign to be undertaken by Harvard—or by any other educational institution—at the time. Quincy’s construction translated President Pusey’s ambitious plans for an expanded campus into a modern, eight-story high-rise reality.AVANT-GARDE OR ARTISTIC MISHAP?As the first undergraduate residence to be built after the original seven river Houses of the early 1930s under President Lowell, in 1959 Quincy represented a new Harvard, breaking with the Georgian-modeled House system.  The current site of Quincy House was formerly occupied by a psychological clinic, Mather Hall—a part of Leverett House—and a row of houses on DeWolfe Street, according to a 1957 Crimson report.  And a report published in the next year by The Crimson stated that in order to reduce construction costs, which were projected to amount to $5 million, architects relied on cost-cutting “skip-stop” planning.Consequently, Quincy House blueprints eliminated the entryway system, bell towers, and multitude of fireplaces that marked the older Houses. Instead, architects opted to have a more economical single corridor run the length of the building. “We were able to get past the fact that it had zero charm because it had all the modern amenities of 1959,” said Bertram E. Busch ’62, noting Quincy’s non-descript, linoleum looking tile floor and lack of darkwood. Former residents also noted the appeal of elevators, modern facilities, and individual bedrooms for each occupant, citing these incentives as a draw from the vibrant culture of the existing Houses. “It wasn’t laden with ghosts of years past,” said John O. Field ’62. “One could imagine 19 year-old fellows thinking ‘this is better than some musky old attic in some other house.’” In addition to its cutting edge architecture, residents recalled the novelty of the House’s avant-garde art, which Busch characterized as “Picassoesque.” Yet in the November 28 edition of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, Harvard alumni expressed disapproval of the artistic quality of the mural decorating Quincy dining hall.  Gordon G. Sampson 1910 and Bernard A. Merrian 1909 agreed that the “graffito resembled the doodling of inmates in a mental hospital.” Despite its controversial décor, Quincy House led in popularity, with 29 percent of freshmen identifying it as their preferred place of residence, compared to the 19 percent who listed Adams, according to a Crimson poll conducted in the March of 1959.    A SECOND ADMISSIONThe select upperclassmen that were chosen to inhabit the newly-constructed residence were charged with the task of establishing a unique House character.  “Creating a new House is an adventurous undertaking,” Quincy’s first master John M. Bullitt ’43 said in 1958. “We want active students to participate in building a House worthy of the other seven,” Bullitt said.In this competitive House application process, Quincy’s first undergraduates were personally interviewed by Bullitt, who, according to former residents, was committed to forging a diverse House community.  “Quincy became a kind of melting pot for everything that was true of young men at Harvard,” said Field.  At a time when assignments to Houses resembled a “second Harvard admissions process,” Gordon said, each upperclassman residence was associated with a unique characteristic.Specifically, undergraduates in Adams were known for being artistic, while Eliot was referred to as the preppy House.  To rival these deeply-rooted House personalities, Quincy quickly formed its own individual House character.  Quincy’s newness contributed to “more free thinking and a greater willingness to violate old Harvard norms in the House,” said Field.  As a result, Quincy became a place for experimentation and advocacy.  The House was the birthplace of a “rebellion against formality,” Field said, noting that Quincy’s first residents began challenging the rule of wearing coats and ties at dinner.In the decade following its construction, Quincy’s sixth floor balcony became a place for staging rallies, according to Busch. “Our causes weren’t exactly noble,” Busch said, recalling Quincy students leading a mob of 1,500 undergraduates in the yard to protest the administration’s 1960 decision to transition from papyrus diplomas in Latin to paper certificates in English.  As the first residents established a fledgling House culture, Quincy’s underlying diversity continued to form the basis of its identity. By 1966, Quincy was the first House to incorporate female tutors and the first to encourage married tutors to raise their families in the House.Five decades later, Quincy is now commonly known as the “People’s House,” a fitting reference to its diverse roots. —Staff writer Bita M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I received my readers’ comments on my thesis last month, they both praised the essay’s “creativity,” while informing me, in very polite terms, that it lacked the “rigor” that defines academic scholarship. I did not find this evaluation surprising. But seeing it written down alongside a grade made me question whether I had drifted through my degree without ever becoming “educated” in some essential sense. Had I, I wondered, somehow failed to obtain what Harvard’s Core Curriculum calls “the knowledge, intellectual skills, and habits of thought” of an “educated” person?It is an odd moment to worry about such things. The educational requirements that I and my fellow seniors fulfilled are now being phased out. The “Core Curriculum,” established in 1978 to define “a standard that meets the needs of the late twentieth century,”  has become outmoded, defunct, quaint. Now, “General Education” is being rolled out to replace it.On face, the Core and Gen Ed aren’t particularly different. At times, Gen Ed even looks like nothing more than a rehashed Core. Both programs demand that students take classes outside their specialized areas. Both advocate the development of a specific set of such courses for non-specialists to ensure that each student gains something the college can call a “liberal arts education.” And both subdivide such courses into eight subject areas, some of which map onto each other with absurd precision. Did we really wait four years to see the “Literature and Arts” requirement renamed “Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding?” “Moral Reasoning,” renamed “Ethical Reasoning?”PARALLEL PATHS, DIVERGENT  MISSIONSDespite their similarities, these parallel programs emerged from very different moments in history. The Core, spearheaded by then-Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky, grew out conflicting desires. The Faculty tried simultaneously to reclaim the university’s authority over what a college education should mean after the permissive 1960s, and to avoid an entirely regressive return to the “Great Books” curriculum of the early twentieth century. The curricular review sparked ferocious debate at the time. “The number of faculty members in the room for the final vote was so large that we had to move to the science center,” Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez recalled. Debates over the new Gen Ed program, by contrast, repeatedly lacked the quorum necessary to take votes and, when they provoked emotion at all it was because they were, in former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68’s words, informed by a “turf battle mentality” whereby departments vied for representation in the curriculum. Despite Gen Ed’s lackluster beginnings, however, it at least ditches the Core’s ideas about the universal importance of academic method. The Core demands familiarity with “the ways in which we gain knowledge;” it tries to discipline young minds into using various academic language and concepts, into thinking in “educated” terms. Gen Ed, on the other hand, aims to “connect in an explicit way what students learn at Harvard to life beyond Harvard” such that it is revealed “how everything we teach in the arts and sciences relates to their lives.” The Core sees education as a kind of professional training in different types of academic thinking. Gen Ed—insofar as its rather generic and all-encompassing mandate can be formulated at all—seems to take education as a development of one’s thoughtful human capacities, most important in its applications to life outside academia.The Faculty should be congratulated, then, for moving from an understanding of education centered entirely on the importance of their profession, to an idea of education that should—in some imprecise way—encompass a student’s entire life. STUMBLING TOWARD GENERAL EDUCATION Unfortunately, practical change has been slow on the heels of this shift. So far, Gen Ed offerings consist more of old Core and departmental classes than newly created courses, and many professors were obliged to change absolutely nothing about their courses in order to reclassify them. (As Psychology Professor Steven Pinker, who teaches a Science B core, wrote to me in an e-mail, “I am not changing my course at all!”).This is partly because many Gen Ed suggestions were simply common sense: Students listen more if your teaching applies to their lives. So professors incorporated positive changes as they went along. For Dominguez, “The course had been growing by accretion,” while Environmental Science Professor Steven C. Wofsy, teacher of my excellent Science A course, “The Atmosphere,” notes that his course (which will be categorized under “Science of the Physical Universe” whenever he next teaches it) already “had many of the features that they wanted in the Gen Ed thing that they were thinking about as being new except for me they weren’t really new.”What are we students, educated in transition, to make of this incoherence? It took the Faculty four years to introduce a well-intentioned and entirely inoffensive educational philosophy to replace the Core, and the result (at least for current students) has been a raft of new names for old courses.The truth is that it was always possible, under the Core program, to obtain a worthwhile education at this university, and, despite the mess the Faculty has made of its reforms, it will continue to be possible under Gen Ed. There are professors here who teach only out of obligation and there are those who genuinely care about pedagogy, and the latter will continue to innovate whether or not a report tells them to do so. DEFINING ‘EDUCATED’ In the end, it is neither the place of  University President Drew G. Faust nor the institution of Harvard to pompously welcome seniors “into the company of educated men and women” on Commencement Day, as if a mortarboard is somehow the last missing piece of the finite jigsaw of one’s “education.” The University no longer even has the chutzpah to define confidently what an “educated” person is. Gen Ed, then, is just one in a series of institutional attempts to deal with the long-term decline of institutional authority over information, which began to fall apart as soon as the business of educating split from the business of worshiping God.Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, the Gen Ed Committee Chair, recognizes this shift. “Students don’t need the Faculty really to provide them with information any more,” he said. “[But] I think students have always needed help in what to do with information, how to process it, how to evaluate it.”  Unfortunately, Gen Ed, born of turf wars and indecision, operating in an old-fashioned bureaucratic structure, is ill-placed to be an organizing force for the “information age.” And what the Curricular Review has shown, once and for all, is that only a thoughtless student would leave it up to an institution like Harvard to decide what her education means.It is still possible that Gen Ed will spark some worthwhile spring-cleaning and a proliferation of creative, new courses. But, either way, upon graduation, the onus is upon students to decide what our education means as a whole—and to realize that, far from being some kind of grand fortress as its end, a Harvard degree is just one of many strange, blinking lighthouses we will sail past on the way.—Juliet S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A handful of students will gather today in leafy Tercentenary Theatre for a ceremony filled with all the pomp and circumstance of Commencement. As newly-commissioned officers in the U.S. armed forces, the students are part of a tradition of service that dates back decades and that once involved hundreds of students. Today’s ceremony will also highlight a relatively new tradition: an address by the university president, the seventh in eight years.
The scene will stand in stark contrast to one of my first experiences as a Crimson reporter. In December 2005, I sat in Harvard Law School’s Harkness Commons as a group of law students listened to an audio stream of oral arguments before the Supreme Court. That case was about whether universities could bar the military from their campuses and still receive federal money. Needless to say, everyone at Harvard thought the answer was yes. When, a couple months later, the court delivered its own answer (an emphatic no), I wrote a second raft of stories in which students and faculty conveyed their dismay with the court’s ruling.
What is interesting is that both of these events accurately reflect the Harvard’s attitude toward the military: the University president honors those who serve, but other segments of the community limit the recognition they receive for doing so. This complicated balancing act is the result of a shift in American attitudes toward the military. When Harvard banned on-campus recruiting in 1969, anti-military sentiment ran deep in leftist circles. Today, though, even the ardent liberals of Harvard’s faculty are quick to praise the valor of service, saying that the decision not to recognize ROTC is reflective only of their commitment to civil rights. As a result, Harvard’s contemporary opposition to the military is exceedingly narrow: specifically, that the military’s prohibition on openly gay-servicemembers violates the University’s non-discrimination policy. And given the changes in the cultural and legislative landscapes in just the past few years, the basis for Harvard’s clash with the military might soon be gone. 
Sometime in the recent past—and perhaps as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks—prevailing non-faculty sentiment at Harvard seems to have shifted strongly in favor of the military. 
University Presidents Lawrence H. Summers and Drew G. Faust have both spoken admiringly of military service: Summers took enormous flack early in his tenure for saying that the military should have a larger role on campus, and Faust, a self-described military historian, has said that she has “enormous respect” for those who participate in ROTC.
Similarly, student opinion seems considerably more favorable of the military than it once was. Where undergraduates once stormed University Hall to have ROTC thrown off campus, a recent poll conducted by ROTC advocates found that three-fifths of students support officially recognizing the program. And even those who remain opposed to the military are far more moderate in their approach than their counterparts of a generation past. During one of its principal demonstrations against the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the Law School’s gay-rights organization confined itself to placing pink soldiers on students’ desks and asking students and faculty to write letters to Congress. When I asked one of the organizers if his group planned to confront military recruiters when they arrived on campus—something the Supreme Court explicitly authorized—he said that it was not appropriate to harass recruiters who had no role in formulating the discriminatory policy.
More important than any change in attitudes at Harvard, however, is the fact that the federal government might soon allow gay individuals to serve in the military openly, a movement that has gathered strength after reports that specialists in high-demand languages like Arabic and Farsi have been discharged for being gay. President Obama has said that he will push Congress to repeal the law, noting that the British armed forces have integrated their ranks without incident. Such a change in policy would strip Harvard of its basis for opposing the military’s presence on campus. Since most liberal politicians—including Obama—have criticized Harvard’s current position, continuing to reject the military after “don’t ask, don’t tell” is repealed would be a public relations disaster, not to mention extremely hypocritical.
Of course, any official recognition of ROTC will actually mean little to Harvard. As it currently stands, ROTC officials do not want to open an office at Harvard, largely because the number of prospective cadets is small. Recognition would be largely symbolic: dropping the official statement opposing ROTC, noting ROTC participation on transcripts, and releasing funds to cover administrative costs at MIT.
But symbols matter, just as Summers and Faust have shown by speaking at the ROTC commissioning ceremonies. If Congress repeals “don’t ask, don’t tell” and Harvard fully recognizes ROTC, the military and academia might finally heal a divide that is now four decades old.

My roommate Eli S. Kupperman ’09 made a senior bucket list a few months ago. It included streaking Harvard Yard, visiting Harpoon Brewery, and jumping off Weeks Footbridge.Done, done, and done, twice, then I did it another seven times just because. If you doubt me, I will fly away on my majestic steed. So, respect ya’ deck, if you know what I mean.Nonetheless, Eli got me thinking of some more ideas for things that every Harvard senior needs to do. Some of these, I have done. Others, I hope one day, or in the next day or two, to do, and do it hard.1. Build a sled and slide down Widener steps. This is great for many reasons: one, sledding kicks ass, two, snow rules, and three, speed is way better than not-speed.Special challenge time: use a HUDS Dining Hall tray instead of a sled. Super challenge time: build the sled entirely out of beer.2. Pretend you’re really attractive and funny and sensitive, and get a really pretty, sweet girl to fall in love with you and then play baseball.3. Ride a dragon. 4. Invent a bouncy cage that never deflates, bounces really high, was once used by Rutherford B. Hayes, and can fly.5.

Kenneth G. Saathoff ’09 RR: What will you miss most about Harvard?KS: Sunrise breakfast quesadillas. Hot breakfast in general.RR: After four years at Harvard, the greatest thing you can think of is a breakfast quesadilla?KS: I’ve actually never had one.RR: ...KS: I’ve never eaten a sunrise breakfast quesadilla.RR: So you lied?KS: I’m sorry. I was disingenuous.RR: Let’s start over. And let’s be honest this time. What will you miss most about Harvard? KS: I should have thought more about this. And about my life in general. Who am I? What am I doing here?RR: I did not ask any of those questions.KS: Hm.RR: I think I’m going to go now.KS: I’d miss my freshman year roommates.RR: So you’ll miss the people.KS: Yeah, that and the strong religious faith of the students here.RR: Okay.KS: And the institutionalized public nudity. And the Bee. Definitely the Bee.RR: I see what you’re doing here. You’re saying things that aren’t true.KS: Well, what will you miss most?RR: I’d say the people.KS: But everyone says that.RR: That’s because it’s true.KS: So deep down we’re all the same.RR: That is stupid.KS: You’re right. Well, I guess I’ll say the people.RR: Great.KS: Or maybe the architecture.RR: I am going to go now. Jared S. Gruszecki ’09 RR: What will you miss most about Harvard?JSG: Potato pierogies at the dining hall.RR: Really?JSG: Well, what have most other people said?RR: The people.JSG: I don’t want to say that. That’s not true.RR: Pretend I’m President Faust. What would you like to tell me?JSG: Stop sending me e-mails. No more e-mails.RR: What if there’s an emergency?JSG: Then you can send one e-mail. Just one. Or use the emergency texting system.RR: What would you most like to change about Harvard?JSG: Shorter e-mails from Drew Faust. How does she expect me to read them? They’re so long. They’re like essays.RR: So e-mail is the thing that really stands out about Harvard? JSG: Yeah, I’d like fewer e-mails and shorter e-mails. And more pierogies.RR: What about an e-mail about pierogies?JSG: That would be fine. Scott T. Gregg ’11 RR: Pretend you’re a senior. What will you miss most about Harvard?SG: Probably my close friends.RR: I’m going to be President Faust and you be you. What would you like to say to me?SG: I’d give a suggestion. I know we’re getting a liberal arts education, but I think there could be more emphasis on guiding students into certain careers. Having a social innovation major where people could look at issues from a variety of perspectives would have a huge effect on the opportunities that people feel like they have when they’re leaving school. If people had more guidance in college to dream and have ambitions I think Harvard could be a much bigger presence in the world than it claims it already is.RR: Well I think you are a presumptuous 20-year-old with bad ideas.SG: Okay, then I will transfer to Stanford.RR: Okay, then I will call Provost Etchemendy at Stanford and ensure that your transfer application is rejected.SG: Well, I’ll make a lot of noise. I’m going to make a difference in the world. If you’re going to help me, you’re going to help me. And if you’re not, you’re not.RR: I will not help you. I am Drew Gilpin Faust, the President of Harvard. Tym Lewtak ’11 RR: What will you miss most about Harvard?TL: Do you want me to be somber or happy?RR: Whatever, man. TL: Okay, well I guess I’d say that the resources are amazing and the people are great.RR: What’s your plan for the next year?TL: I’m going to study in London this summer, then back to Harvard. Right now I have a sense of stability that nothing bad can happen for two years.RR: But then you won’t get a job.TL: I’d like to think otherwise.RR: But you probably won’t.TL: We’ll see...RR: Yeah, we will. TL: Wow, way to lower my self-esteem.RR: Sorry man.

The number of Harvard seniors entering finance and consulting has fallen by half in the past year, with just one fifth of all seniors seeking full-time employment taking jobs in one of the two sectors, according to The Crimson’s third annual senior survey.
The strong trend away from finance and consulting is likely the result of the economic crisis, which has devastated the financial markets and leveled major firms like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, two companies that had actively recruited at Harvard in the past.
The number of seniors entering finance and consulting has fallen from 47 percent in 2007 to 39 percent in 2008 to 20 percent for the current Class of 2009. The financial sector saw the largest reduction, falling from 23 percent to 11.5 percent, while the share of seniors entering consulting fell from 16 percent to 8.5 percent.

Since the dawn of time, Prestige and Mobility have spoken truth to power, power to truth, and Esperanto to the people of the world [1], meaning we’ve missed out on some of the spectacular Harvard social life. Since we’ve been exhausted from trying to catch up on four years of missed fun, we tried to use WolframAlpha.com to write this column, but he just gave us the weather on the day of David Ortiz’s birth. [2] So, inspired by Rocky Balb-onion, the Italian scallion, we return to the one thing that we all have in common: expos. In this paper we will argue that you should not be sad that you are leaving Harvard because you did not actually enjoy your time here, with special reference to the works of Virginia Woolf. [3]Most of this column was originally our class day speech. We knew we didn’t have a shot in the male serious, male humor, female serious, or female humor [4] categories, so we submitted it under obese Latina in a Tweety bird t-shirt category. But Margaret M. Wang ’09 won again—some people are just naturals. When we were but small freshmen, we lived, for a time, in a pre-Qdoba, post-Lamont Dessert Riot universe with antiquated institutions like solvent I-banking and the American car industry. Come back to that time with us for a moment.I’m sure we all spent that summer before college the same way. You worried about whether you had enough pairs of cargo shorts to get you through first semester. (Answer: No, because you can never have too many pairs of cargo shorts.) Above all, you wondered: would college life really be as cool, chill, and homoerotic as membership in the Harvard ’09 Fellas Facebook group made it seem? (Answer: Yes.)We all spent our college careers the same way: trying to record the perfect acappella cover of K-Ci and JoJo’s 1998 superhit “All my Life” to finally seduce Jessica S. Lin ’09. How tough is it to get the Fallen Angels in a recording studio? Those girls are always on the go!But these next few years after graduation will be different. First off, you will be thrown a lot fewer Nerf Vortex footballs, Jock Jams will not be played when you enter a room, and business casual will no longer include Umbro shorts. Oh, sorry. This is about Harvard? That’s from our 1997 elementary school graduation Prestige and Mobility column.The real world will be tougher than Harvard, though. Brain breaks will start at 11 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. Instead of having two free weeks to prepare before completing your most difficult tasks, you will have only 10 days, and all classes—not just language classes—will meet during reading period. Your first year at work, unlike your freshman seminar, will be graded. All police departments are not like HUPD. After you are caught breaking the law, they will not bring you back to your room to help destroy the evidence and smooth things out with the Ad Board. (Thanks, Officer Thompson. You were right: it was mostly placenta anyway.)Still, it’s been a wild ride. Enriched by the core, we can now answer questions like, “Are numbers magical? Is this art and/or literature I’m encountering an A, B or C? What would this look like as a Japanese woodblock print?” No, we can’t figure out that tip, but we can detect it medically. Are those dinosaurs attacking our city? Let’s talk to their relatives and see if we can work something out.Above all, we our indebted to our classes and professors. Justice: you taught me that everything that I needed to know about right and wrong would be sent to me in the form of a 500-page study guide two days before the final. Greg Mankiw: you taught me that you can still be listed as the instructor for a course while only giving three lectures a semester and selling each one of your students your $150 textbook—now that’s what I call cost/benefit analysis! To my expos class, you made me a better person. To my expos preceptor, you made me a man.Who knows, if the economy recovers, some of us might even become rich, but what will you do with your mammon? Will you give back to those who need it most? For only $75 a day, the price of one Shaq rookie card, you can sponsor an Isis girl and supply her with all the Berryline toppings, Daedalus Appletinis and SlutGear® that she needs to bring together a diverse group of Harvard women for the purpose of building friendships and a strong system of support on campus and in the world beyond. [5]In closing, it’s graduation. You have one final chance to hook up with that girl or guy that you’ve had a crush on since freshman year. And if your hook up says, “Sure, but the Tweety bird shirt stays on,” just roll with it. It’s worth it. ;^)If only you had known that earlier, how much you would sing.[1] It takes a global village.[2] WE DON’T KNOW WHAT WE COULD POSSIBLY DO WITH THIS.[3] We might need to sharpen this. What is the effect? Does it at all relate to the rest of the paper?[4] Wait, is that category the joke?[5] http://theisisclub.org/donations.php. Dear Reader, this donations thing isn’t a joke. Dear Isis, Please direct all complaints to 925-876-3932. You thought we were scared, but we’ve just been waiting.

Emily D. Donahue ’09 and Greg J. Mancuso prove that it’s not always opposites that attract.Mancuso, 24, and Donahue, 22—who got engaged last month after almost a year of dating—are both vegetarians who enjoy exercising, listen to similar music, and say they rarely argue.The couple met through a study held at William James Hall and went on their first date last May. Over dinner at an Indian restaurant, the pair bonded over their shared taste in music. Mancuso, who had spent the past few years playing 300 nights a year with his band, GBD Band, admired Donahue’s Beatles t-shirt and anecdote about singing Frank Zappa on the playground as a young child.The East Ruckland, Mass. resident said he worried that Donahue would not want to go on a second date with him. It didn’t help that after he asked about a second date, Donahue told him that she’d go on another date with him even if she didn’t actually want to.“I don’t know why I felt the need to explain that, but I did actually want to go out with him again,” said Donahue, a psychology concentrator.Donahue said she was surprised Mancuso recognized her on their second date—she had cut 20 inches of her hair off and gotten her ears pierced in the days between their first and second dates. Luckily, Mancuso said he liked her short hairstyle, and during the following summer, Donahue remained in Cambridge to work for the Harvard Summer School Activities Office and the couple spent much of their time together.Over the summer, the couple traveled together to both Florida and Provincetown, Mass, which Donahue—an active member of both the Queer Students and Allies and the True Love Revolution during her time at Harvard—said she particularly enjoyed.The couple began discussing marriage after about nine months of dating, but Donahue had told Mancuso she wouldn’t marry anyone unless they had been dating for at least a year. She didn’t expect it when Mancuso proposed on Castle Island after eleven months and two weeks of dating.“After we’d already decided we wanted to move in together and spend the rest of our lives together, that was kind of the logical step, so I was really excited about it,” said Donahue, a Georgia native.After Donahue graduates, the couple will move to Rio Grande Valley, Texas where she will teach elementary school through Teach for America and he will work as an Edward Jones financial advisor. The couple plans to wed on June 6 of next year, but have yet to decide if they will be married in Massachusetts or in Texas. Donahue said it will likely be a “kind of weird wedding” with multiple flower girls, male bridesmaids, and lots of bright colors.The pair described themselves as very affectionate and recalled one instance in which they were “clingy” while riding the T together. When Mancuso got off before Donahue, both said, “I love you.”“Apparently!” said another woman on the train.

For one couple, the basement of The Fox is about more than just dance parties or drinking games.During reading period in January of their freshman year, Katherine G. Mims ’09 and Mark E. Crocker ’09 met at The Fox—and in Mims’ own words, it was “totally sketchy.”“We had so many friends in common, but we had never officially met,” Crocker said. In fact, Mims even found a picture taken on his cell phone before they had met of her standing on the John Harvard statue. They have been a couple since that January and will wed next June outside of Richmond, Va., after they each complete their first year of graduate school.In over three years of dating, Mims and Crocker have studied abroad together for a semester in St. Andrew’s, Scotland, and spent three long days crabbing and taught themselves how to shuck crabs. And, the two claim they make a fierce Beirut team.Mims has not one but two engagement rings. When Crocker asked for her parents’ permission over the summer, they told him to ask them again in a month, at which point he gave her a family heirloom ring. After asking her parents again and receiving their blessing, Crocker proposed—with another ring—on a bench across from Weeks Bridge on their first night back at school this year.Next fall, Mims will begin law school at the University of Virginia, while Crocker starts dentistry studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.

They say that love finds you in unexpected places. For Ritambhara Kumar ’09, that place was the catwalk of the South-Asian fashion show “Andaaz” in May 2007. Her future husband, Neil K. Aggarwal, had the “dubious distinction” of being the only graduate student in the show, she said.Kumar, at the time a sophomore, made the first move by e-mailing Aggarwal, a graduate student in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, after the show. The two had a four-hour first date at Café Pamplona and spent nearly all their time together while Aggarwal finished his master’s degree. When he graduated that spring, they continued to see each other long-distance. Kumar made frequent trips to New Haven, where Aggarwal is now conducting a residency at Yale to become a psychiatrist. “I should be the Greyhound or the Amtrak brand ambassador,” Kumar said.This spring, with Kumar’s friends gathered at Small Plates for tea, Aggarwal proposed—though Kumar will have to wait until the official engagement ceremony on June 7 for a ring.While most undergraduates still tremble at the idea of marriage, Kumar said she never had that “phobia” and that she realized almost immediately that Aggarwal was the right man for her. She says he, on the other hand, “took a little bit more convincing.”“It’s not so much about the timing but about the person,” she said. “I cannot imagine spending my life in a better way than with Neil. It seemed inevitable to me.”Kumar said that her parents, whose marriage was arranged, and her friends have been very supportive of her decision to marry Aggarwal. Although Kumar said she looks forward to the couple’s late December wedding, she admitted that with 1,000 expected guests from around the world, it will be quite “chaotic.” The wedding, a traditional three-day Hindu affair, will take place in Mumbai, where the bride’s family lives. Next year, Kumar and Aggarwal will live together in New Haven as Aggarwal continues his residency and Kumar, an economics concentrator, begins a job at the investment firm Bridgewater. The couple has not yet picked a honeymoon destination, but Kumar said that they may travel to Morocco or Turkey.

The first time that Joshua S. Downer ’09 called Taylor M. Owings ’08 his girlfriend, he was wearing a “redneck fat suit.”It was Halloween 2006 and one of Owings’ roommates had just asked Downer why he had not yet asked Owings to be his girlfriend. Downer had assumed it was implicitly understood that they were together, but on the way back from a party, when he ran into someone he knew, he introduced Owings as his girlfriend.Downer and Owings had met earlier that semester at the activities fair held each year, where Owings was tabling for STAGE, a student organization that promotes theater in local public schools. He ended up joining the group and they started dating shortly afterward.“I was walking around looking for new extracurricular activities and found one for the rest of my life, I guess you could say,” Downer said.Girlfriend became fiancée while the two were on vacation with Owings’ family in Jamaica this past Christmas break, after the couple had been together for over two years. Downer and Owings had just watched the Dallas Cowboys lose a game and a playoff berth.“I started to cry because it was really, really sad for Josh that his team had lost and I knew it would have been really fun to watch the playoffs together,” Owings said.The conversation evolved into a discussion of how lucky they feel to care so much about each other’s interests and passions.Downer had been planning on proposing in Jamaica and had asked Owings’ parents for permission beforehand. He knew that Owings did not want a grand gesture and thought the moment was right.Their wedding this July will certainly befit their Harvard beginnings: the ceremony will take place at Memorial Church, with the reception at the downtown Harvard Club.

Nicole M. Gandia ’09 and her fiancé Lino A. Gonzalez first forged their relationship over a love of salsa dancing. “We met my freshman year. We both dance salsa and I went to take his salsa class,” Gandia said. “Months later, I went out to dance salsa in Central Square at a place called the Havana Club, and he was there. We started dancing.”The pair grew to be quick friends and salsa partners, but did not become romantic for several years. “We were both in relationships, and from my freshman year up until my junior year we were friends,” Gandia said. “Our relationship was limited to salsa.”But one night over dancing, Gandia and Gonzalez realized that they had both broken up with their respective significant others. They started dating soon after, and on the couple’s one-year anniversary, Gonzalez proposed. Gonzalez completed his Ph.D in chemical engineering at MIT in 2008. Although Gandia is eight years his junior, she doesn’t think about the age difference. “We were both students when we met. We like doing the same fun things together,” she said. “I think we’re the same emotional age.”The couple just purchased a condominium together in Davis Square, where they will live for the next two years. Gonzalez will be working for the chemical engineering company Aerodyne, and Gandia will join Teach for America in Boston. She plans on applying to law school.After a long engagement, the couple will wed next summer in Puerto Rico. The traditional Catholic ceremony will take place in a church and the reception will be held at a hotel in the beachfront neighborhood of El Condado in San Juan. Gandia, who comes from a large family, estimates that over 300 guests will attend the festive affair.“We are all very into music and dancing, so music will be a big part of the wedding,” Gandia said. “We’ll have an orchestra of guitars, a Latin music band, and an English band. Both of our families like to party.”

Although Jennifer M. DeCoste-Lopez ’09 said that she and her husband Cesar J. Lopez ’09 were looking forward to being married, they were not looking forward to the wedding ceremony. “I’m not the kind of person who grew up saying ‘This is what my wedding is going to be like.’ I was kind of dreading it,” DeCoste-Lopez said one afternoon in the Quincy Grille. “But it turned out to be so much fun,” she continued with a wide smile aimed at Lopez, who was seated next to her. The two were married in the bride’s hometown of Richmond, Ky., on August 23, 2008—a date they said they picked because it was the only one that worked with their schedules of working in their labs, studying for the MCATS, and DeCoste-Lopez’s brother’s start date for his freshman year at Transylvania University. The ceremony displayed a fusion of the bride’s and groom’s disparate cultural backgrounds. Because Lopez’s family is Catholic and primarily Spanish-speaking and DeCoste-Lopez’s family is Protestant and English-speaking, the wedding alternated between Spanish and English with the aid of both a local Spanish-speaking priest and DeCoste-Lopez’s pastor. “People seemed to like it,” she said with a laugh. “At least that’s what they told us.” Lopez, a chemical and physical biology concentrator from San Jose, California, and DeCoste-Lopez, a biology concentrator, met their freshman year when they were both housed in Thayer on the fifth floor. A friendship soon blossomed out of their shared love of playing pranks. But it was not until their sophomore year that the couple began dating. By the following summer—when they were both participating in the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering—they were discussing marriage. Lopez asked DeCoste-Lopez to marry him when she came to visit him during intersession the next year. The two traveled to San Francisco where Lopez planned to propose at Ocean Beach near Golden Gate Park. When they arrived, DeCoste-Lopez began writing messages in the sand. “She kind of played right into it,” Lopez said. “So I said ‘Okay, I’m going to write you a message now, and I’ll call you when I’m done.’”In the sand, he wrote, “Jennifer, will you marry me? Love, Cesar,” to which Jennifer exclaimed, “Oh my God, yes,” through tears of joy.The couple is conducting research this upcoming year at the Longwood campus as they apply to medical school, which they plan to attend together.

Sometimes it takes married couples years to be able to finish each other’s sentences. But Eric T. Smith, the fiancé of Rachel J. Gottlieb ’09, didn’t even need to propose to her out loud.On a “makeshift” Valentine’s Day date in late February, Gottlieb and Smith were walking along a pier near the Boston aquarium when she felt him carving a message on her back with his finger, writing slowly and carefully so she could understand. The letters spelled out “M-A-R-R-Y M-E.” “When I turned around, he had the ring out,” Gottlieb said. Gottlieb met Smith during their sophomore year of high school in Rochester, N.Y., but Gottlieb says “you can’t really quite classify us as high school sweethearts.”They kept in touch when Gottlieb came to Harvard and Smith started school at Michigan State University, but they only started dating last year, when Smith came to visit Gottlieb in Boston for dinner in the North End and a walk around the city.The couple will tie the knot on June 26, 2010, Gottlieb said, adding that they’re still trying to decide between two locations. Gottlieb said that she and Smith will spend the summer getting a head start on planning the wedding, since starting in the fall, it will be harder to find a spare moment.Gottlieb, a biochemical sciences concentrator, will begin medical school at Johns Hopkins University, and Smith will take on a public-sector consulting job with IBM. They will live together in Baltimore.

When Daniel J. Rinehart ’09 proposed to his fiancé Leslie E. Nightingale ’09 last May, his plan did not unfold exactly the way he intended. On their first date their freshman year, Rinehart, a religion concentrator from Northfield, Minn., took Nightingale, a history and literature concentrator from St. Louis, Mo., to the Bunker Hill Monument. So when he decided to ask Nightingale to marry him, that monument seemed like the logical choice for location. This time around, Rinehart decided to take the bus instead of the subway in order to keep the proposal a surprise. After losing the monument from their sight on a walk that quickly became painful for Nightingale in her new high heels, the two feared that they might be lost until a passerby indicated they were on the right path. Rinehart and Nightingale finally arrived at the monument, which was surrounded by approximately 10 school buses and a hoard of tourists. “One of the main reasons why I thought Bunker Hill would be such a great place to propose is because the first time we went nobody was there,” Rinehart said with a slight smile on his face. “And so I thought, ‘Okay, I’ll see how this goes.’”After waiting for the tourists to thin out to no avail, Rinehart leaned into an alcove near a window, pulled out the ring, and proposed. “We stood there and enjoyed the moment for a little while until a woman who wanted to take a picture out the window asked us to move,” he said. “But then we went out for dinner later and that was nice,” Nightingale added, gazing into Rinehart’s eyes. The couple met their freshman year in a Russian class. After getting to know each other while studying for the class in Weld, where they both lived, the two became fast friends and soon started dating.“Daniel’s always sweet to me. He’s a good guy and he makes me laugh,” Nightingale said. “I always feel comfortable when I’m around him.” The couple plans to spend the next year teaching at an international school in Korea, where Nightingale will most likely teach history and Rinehart will teach humanities and social studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Daniel R. Jou ’08 first broached the topic of marriage with Ola B. Aljawhary ’09, Aljawhary, who had just turned 19 and was still in her self-proclaimed “tomboy stage,” she worried that she was too young and put the idea on hold.Aljawhary and Jou met during her freshman year through the Harvard Islamic Society. According to religious tradition—both are Sunni Muslims—the two could not date without a chaperone and their interactions were limited to group settings.“We didn’t really know each other very personally before engaging the process for pursuing marriage, “ said Jou, explaining that they didn’t flirt and that generally, romance was not a part of their courtship.Following Aljawhary’s initial hesitation, both continued to work together for HIS, although their relations were admittedly “very awkward.” Eventually, Jou returned to the subject during his senior year. After a series of encounters in which Aljawhary’s family and friends asked Jou to answer a “list of questions” in order to gauge his potential as a husband, Jou proposed officially over last Thanksgiving break. In a symbolic acknowledgment of Aljawhary’s Egyptian background, Jou, whose parents are Iranian, wrote and pronounced the proposal in Arabic. While the moment may have been awkward for everyone involved, Jou noted playfully that “she is still more embarrassed than I am.”“It’s really embarrassing to have someone go and on and on praising you for two pages,” Aljawhary responded, adding that it is “very flattering, but also nerve-wracking.”Throughout the entire engagement process, both families remained heavily involved, providing an important “support system” for the young newly-weds, said Aljawhary. While Aljawhary may have originally been wary of marrying at a young age, she found that she and Jou had “a lot more in common” than she had anticipated. Jou and Aljawhary were officially married in December, a month after his proposal, in a ceremony performed by an imam. The wedding reception will take place in New Jersey, where the bride’s family lives, in July, because the couple wanted to wait until after Aljawhary’s graduation for the festivities. The party will, in many ways, resemble more familiar Western weddings: the veiled bride will wear white as guests feast and dance. Aljawhary and Jou have also been careful to obey Muslim standards regarding courtship, while at the same time trying to adapt timeless traditions to the context of recent Muslim-American immigrant communities. “It’s definitely a challenge because you have to be very creative and you have to be open-minded,” Aljawhary said.
