Driving in Massachusetts is on a road to becoming more of a luxury. Yesterday, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority voted to increase toll prices in a staggered fashion—by a factor that depends on whether a gas-tax increase will also be approved. In an attempt to rid the state’s transportation system of its debt, and to bolster the budget by half a billion dollars, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 has suggested raising the gasoline tax by 19 cents in the state—nearly double its current level. His proposal, which would leave Massachusetts with one of the highest gas taxes in the country, makes both economic and environmental sense, and the gas-tax hikes should be approved.The hike in the gas tax will have several benefits to those living in Massachusetts. The money generated will serve to cover the deficit in the transportation budget and allow needed maintenance operations to take place. A large portion of the funds will go toward maintaining the roads and bridges that make up the Turnpike, but the MBTA would also benefit. Its fares could be maintained at current prices, and all cuts in service would become unnecessary.Considered Pigouvian, the gas tax makes driving reflect its true cost, economically and environmentally. Driving and burning gas is associated with many negative externalities, as it produces pollution and contributes to global warming—both of which tax payments can help offset. On the environmental front, a higher gas tax will also create incentives for motorists to buy more fuel-efficient cars, or even hybrids. It might also encourage people to carpool or use the public transportation system more often. This in turn will decrease air pollution and traffic jams.In addition, if the tax is passed, future toll increases will be unnecessary. This is fortunate, as gas taxes reflect a more equitable taxing policy than tolls, since all motorists share the tax burden fairly, not just those who travel on certain roads. The alternative solution—increasing tollbooth rates—also does not promote the adoption of greener modes of transportation.Further incentives besides the tax should be considered to help combat the environmental cost of driving and encourage the adoption of lower-emission vehicles. For instance, subsidies for cleaner energy production should continue to be explored.Ultimately, this tax will lead to a better transportation system that collects from motorists based on how much they drive, not where they drive. Indirectly, the tax will also help to minimize the state’s impact on the environment—something that we can all appreciate.

When President Obama named Hillary Clinton as his nominee for secretary of state last December, Clinton responded: “Mr. President-elect, I am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century.” On such an adventure they did embark, which this narrator shall now relate with perfect verisimilitude:
No sooner did Don Obama and his loyal squire Clinton enter the land of La Presidencia, than they found themselves on a very great hill overlooking a long street below. Don Obama, astride his old horse, looked down at this scene for some time before addressing himself to his squire, who sat peaceably atop her donkey.
“What is this street, Sancha Clinton? It seems to me that there are a great many people here, and while many of them are well-outfitted, many also clutch their purses in tears. What ill fortune could have brought them such sadness?”
Sancha Clinton responded:
“This is the place they call ‘Wall Street,’ where men come to make their fortunes, but also to lose them. Those in their prime have been leveled by the subprime, as well as by other unexplained forces, and, as they say, every coin has both heads and tails, and gold melts to water in the fingers of those who too hotly grasp it.”
Don Obama considered this, turning his gaze this way and that along the street, then raised his voice in a sudden challenge to the taxis crawling below:
“Enchanters of the economy! You who are so great in number, what purpose do you have in causing anguish to these people? With what audacity do you deprive good men of their livelihood, strip once bustling towns of commerce to planks and ghosts, and all the while hide your faces behind your masks of metal? Reveal yourselves! I shall at once run straight through any such villain as dares confront me, correcting these deep injustices and winning glory for my good lady Michelle of Chicago.”
With that, he dug his heels in and charged his steed at full gallop toward the yellow flanks of a passing cab. Watching her master behaving thus, Clinton cried after him:
“Señor! You must stop at once! Those are not spirits but taxis! And while any spirit would unquestionably tremble at the sight of one so ferocious, these beasts are so many, and made of metal so thick, that one cannot help but doubt the effectiveness of your lance. Such action will do little to quell the fears of those who call you ‘quixotic.’ Besides, all arms we have are needed in Afghanistan.”
Don Obama paid no heed to this speech, colliding with great force against the door of the vehicle, which suffered no injury at all compared to him who had intended to give it. Sancha Clinton hurried down the slope to set her master aright and listened as he spoke.
“You are right, Sancha, these enchanters are indeed tricky devils. But we must not give up hope, for there are other means to combat them.”
“And what would those be, your grace?”
“Sancha, if I have learned any lesson from my years on the trail, it is this. Grave threats require swift action and dauntless courage, as my recent actions have demonstrated. But the path to victory often lies in persuasion of another kind, and any knight worth his armor must fight with his mind as much as with his hand. These enchanters will not be driven out until we have good schools to educate children in the virtues of valor and grace; good doctors to keep bodies fit for work, whether this be threshing the fields or engaging in knight errantry; and good technology to keep our shores green, so that verses may be written extolling them for generations to come.”
Once again, Sancha was astonished at the great sense shown by her master, whose words inspired even those in distant lands who had not witnessed his deeds. Directing their animals southward, the two turned toward their beloved Casa Blanca, prepared to embark on whatever new adventures awaited them.

On January 12, NPR broadcast an interview given by the neoconservative economist N. Gregory Mankiw, the former chair of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors and professor at Harvard University. I agree with Dr. Mankiw’s support for free trade and his expression of disappointment that the Republican-controlled Congress did not reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, most of his ideas are precisely what led to our country’s current economic disaster. 
Science is simple. It tests hypotheses, observes the results, and then creates new hypotheses and theories. A scientific economist would clearly see the results of implementing Professor Mankiw’s theories. They failed, just as the economic theories of Karl Marx failed. The Soviet Union imploded under Marx’s economic policies, and our country nearly imploded in 1939 and 2008 as a result of conservative economic policies.
Mankiw proudly pointed to lifting the country out of the recession in 2001 by supporting tax cuts, particularly for the wealthy, but neglected to see or admit that the cuts contributed to our current economic catastrophe. It is self-evident that by deregulating financial markets and dramatically increasing our national debt his policies simply postponed an intensified recession until 2008.
He consistently supported lower taxes. Now is not the time to raise taxes, but if we don’t eventually lower our national debt, we will all become poor, no matter how low our taxes might be.
His support of less government regulation led to the collapse of Enron, the Madoff scandal, the housing crisis, the credit crisis, a deteriorating environment, global warming, and other ills. Managed capitalism can be wonderful, but if we allow the greedy to do whatever they want, we will again face sweatshops, 70-hour work weeks for the poor, lower wages, and an even greater economic mess than we currently face.  
During the interview, Mankiw proposed that lower taxes, rather than paying for infrastructure development, would be better for the economy. During the interview, he maintained that we should go slowly when creating infrastructure projects. Investments in building roads, a better national electric grid, new green industries, quality education that is free to everyone, and other infrastructure investments will create jobs and increase our national income, because employed people pay taxes instead of collecting unemployment or welfare. Infrastructure development creates real long-term wealth, not just higher stock prices based on complex unregulated security transactions. 
Lower taxes might eventually create some jobs, but their efficacy has been recently tested with the Bush tax rebates. They didn’t work well.  A new hypothesis should be that investing in infrastructure revives a failing economy better than lowering taxes. Roosevelt tried this, and it worked.
The world has learned from experience and observation that neither neoconservative nor communist economic theories work. It is time for Professor Mankiw and other conservative opinion leaders in Congress, academia, and the media to reevaluate some of their core beliefs about economics and social justice. 
We need to become a nation that pays for what we spend, not borrow to spend. In addition, a well-functioning government should regulate business and level the playing field so that every hard-working individual can share in a prosperous economy. Once individuals become prosperous, they should contribute more so others can succeed. Lower taxes and less government would be wonderful, but that implementation nearly destroyed our economy.
For the sake of our country, Professor Mankiw should reevaluate some of his economic theories in the cold light of reality. As policy, his theories have led our country to economic calamity. Many neoconservatives are bright and certainly influential. Their ideas count. For the sake of our country, they should rethink their core economic beliefs and stop supporting the failed Bush economic policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, as the 133rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show got underway in New York, sheriffs were raiding a puppy mill in Sparta, Tenn. The emaciated dogs that sheriffs hauled from cramped wire cages could not have looked more different than the pampered pooches atop pedestals in Madison Square Garden. But they hinted at a common ailment: the commodification of our nation’s dogs.
Dogs have held a special place in our culture since their domestication some 15,000 years ago. Roman shepherds kept herding dogs, medieval monks first made them pets, and Victorian aristocrats groomed them to perfection. Today, four in 10 American households have dogs, and 94 percent of Americans say they feel close to their dogs—by contrast, just 74 percent say they feel close to their dads. This spring, 104 Harvard students enrolled in a new History of Science course, “Dogs and How We Know Them.” 
At its best, this reflects the closeness of the human-animal bond. After Hurricane Katrina, one of the most moving stories told was of an old man found floating with his dog on a trailer tire. When asked to leave the dog, he refused, stating simply that he’d lose everything except the one creature he knew he could trust.
This dog love has also driven a flourishing industry. Most dog owners bought presents for their canine companions this holiday season, churning $5 billion into the American economy. For those with dogs wanting to bring in the New Year in style, the Ritzy Canine Carriage House in Manhattan offered a “Presidential Suite” for dogs at a cool $175 per night. 
But the underbelly of the pet-breeding industry is rather less luxurious. Last month, sheriffs in North Carolina and Tennessee raided a series of puppy mills, large-scale breeding operations where dogs are confined in crowded and unsanitary conditions. Videos showed diseased dogs pulled from small, filthy cages, their paws mutilated by the wires.
The puppies from such operations are sent to pet stores across the nation, where unsuspecting pet lovers pay a premium for their pedigree. A recent Humane Society of the United States investigation found that Petland stores continue to source dogs from puppy mills.
Meanwhile, dog shelters across the nation are reporting record intakes as housing foreclosures and job losses force people to abandon their pets. Last year, an estimated four million cats and dogs were killed in shelters for want of adoption. This year, with fewer adoptions, that figure will likely increase.
For a smaller number of these dogs, the alternative to adoption may be a fate worse than death. In 1966, LIFE magazine shocked the nation with an expose entitled “Concentration Camps for Dogs,” detailing the gruesome trade of dog dealers who plied impounded pets to animal testing laboratories. And, though that trade has since been regulated, 70,000 dogs still go unwillingly under the vivisectionist’s scalpel in America every year, some of them former pets.
Some solutions to this crisis are obvious. President Barack Obama has publicly announced that he will adopt a shelter dog to be the First Pet—a noble example that will hopefully inspire others. Spaying and neutering have caught on across the country, though a quarter of dogs still slip outside the programs. Tighter regulations on puppy mills and animal laboratories would be a good first step to stopping needless suffering.
At a more basic level, we need to reconsider the legal framework that views dogs as commodities. While most dog owners love their companions, for other owners dogs remain disposable items to be cuddled when cute and cut when cumbersome. Sadly, the law still sides with this latter group in allowing the mass production and mass killing of pets.
A century ago, a young lawyer named George Graham Vest, later to become a U.S. senator, addressed a Missouri courthouse on a case concerning the killing of a pet dog. 
“Gentlemen of the jury,” he declared, “a man’s dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds below, and the snow drives fiercely, if only he can be by his master’s side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince.”	
Hopefully one day we’ll repay the respect.

While Ivy League rock stars may be a rare breed Stealth Foxx stands out as a Harvard band with bigger plans.Described by guitarist John J. “Jay” Costa, Jr. ’09 as “rock with folk and jazz pretty heavily intertwined,” the quartet has garnered a solid fan base of Harvard students and Bostonians alike.Costa and vocalist R. Derek Wetzel ’10 started jamming together while attending Boston College High School. The duo continued their artistic pursuits at Harvard, and were eventually joined by drummer Peter Simonelli, a student at the Art Institute of Boston, and bassist Mike Leitzel. Stealth Foxx has performed in a variety of area venues. The band recently won a battle of the bands at Church Restaurant & Nightclub in Boston. “We’re very devoted to live performance and an organic sound, and all our recordings thus far have been live,” said Costa.Fans also note  the band’s apparent enthusiasm for their art.  “It’s obvious that they love their art, and the peaceful and funky vibe that they have on stage is contagious,” said Lauren E. Schwartze ’09.Stealth Foxx’s first album is slated for a spring release. “We’ve been totally independently producing it,” said Wetzel, who is also a Crimson Arts editor. “We would love to be signed if there’s someone interested in our sound for what it is, we really have a love for music and we have a very specific vision of what we want our music to be.”That “specific vision” doesn’t necessarily extend to the band’s peculiar name. “It just came out of a goofy conversation and kind of stuck,” said Costa, “[it’s] sort of reflective of how seriously we take ourselves,” . Check them out March 6th at the Cantab Lounge in Central Square or April 17th at the Queens Head Pub.

Alcohol can sometimes tear apart homes. But this weekend, it built them. At the Habitat for Humanity beer pong tournament in the PfoHo Bell Tower this Saturday, there was one principle—for every cup you make, God will send Stephen W. Piatelli ’10 to build a house for a poor person. FM paid the $10 entry fee and became one of the 32 teams in the tournie. Righteousness ensued.9:30 p.m.—Game time. Our first opponents’ training and preparation?  “I showered,” says Jessica S. Lin ’09, a former Crimson associate photo chair. The atmosphere of the game play is one of godliness, philanthropy, and non-competitiveness. We crush them utterly.9:53 p.m.—“We watched ‘Gladiator’ and flipped through the fight scenes to prepare,” says our next opponent, Christopher H. Miller ’10. We come out victorious, however. Sinking the last cup feels much like how, I imagine, Congress felt when it founded the Peace Corps.10:12 p.m.—In the losers’ bracket, Yuan F. Liu ’09 is effuse with the glow of good works.  “We connect to the people we’re helping through the beer,” Liu said, speaking with the calm of a saint.  “Losing for charity is winning.”10:46 p.m.—We take shots before taking our shots. My body feels swirly.11:02 p.m.—The vodka is flowing, perhaps explaining our next opponents’ team name, “Team Hungry Hungry Habitat for Humanity”. I take the rebuttal—I sink it! BAM! I am the Mother Teresa of beer pong.11:15 p.m.— Are the finals more relaxed since it’s for charity?  “No. In fact, I feel more competitive,” says our opponent Paul T. Hedrick ’10, a Crimson sports editor and experienced bro-ponger. “This event is as bro as an event can be,” he explains. “I feel bro playing for charity.”We lose. But leaving the tournament, I feel good.  For once on a Saturday night, I don’t just feel drunker-than-thou.

When Frances I. Martel ’09 visited the Office of Career Services her freshman year hoping to intern for MSNBC, she recalls receiving an unexpected reply: “Doesn’t consulting sound good, also?” 
A common complaint among students like Martel is that OCS can seem like a restaurant with a chef who is hard of hearing: no matter what you order, you get the same dish. 
According to Robin E. Mount, interim director of OCS, there is some truth behind the perception that her office primarily caters to consulting and finance. “I think that is an honest conclusion because when [finance] companies come to campus, they make a lot of noise,” says Mount. “That’s why we felt that we had to turn up the volume on these other options.” 
Having attended an OCS panel, Alice Chi ’09 remarks that the office tends to focus disproportionately on consulting and what she terms “high-end jobs.”
Now that a slowing economy has burst the hiring bubble in financial services, OCS is making a greater effort to help students find careers in other areas. They’ve organized 15 “cluster areas,” ranging from human rights to sports management.
Last semester, Martel spoke about her summer internship at Telemundo on an OCS panel for careers in media and entertainment.  “It was sort of like the OCS was giving us blessing.  They were saying it’s okay to be in the media,” she says. 
Though skeptical about the short-term benefits of the recent changes, Martel was optimistic about the office’s usefulness in the future.
“For my class and maybe the juniors, nothing will change because [the office’s] reputation is already instilled,” she says. “But for the freshmen whose first impression of OCS is a media panel or something more out-there, they would feel more comfortable.”
It looks like OCS is starting to offer more variety on the menu.

Here’s something you probably don’t know: Harvard has a (not so shitty!) men’s hockey team. I recently found myself at the Beanpot, an annual hockey tournament between Boston College, Boston University, Harvard, and Northeastern. It was probably the closest I’d been to an ice rink since the second grade, when I quit skating after a traumatizing two-week stint with an impatient instructor. We had different philosophies about encouragement.  The arena was packed—with BU fans, with BC fans, with Northeastern fans. Representing Harvard?  Two small rows of band.I’m not going to call myself a super sports fan. I left the Harvard-Yale tailgate because I was cold, and, even after much explanation, I have no idea what a “down” is. It doesn’t make sense, and I refuse to believe otherwise.I also have little pep. Like almost everyone else at this school, I enjoy two things: G-chat and complaining. Usually, both at the same time.       But watching these other schools cheer, I kind of wished more Harvard people were there. There I was, wearing the Harvard sweatshirt that I bought during pre-frosh weekend, excited by the Leverett 80’s dance and the Scrabble I played with my host. For the first time since then, I was wearing it out of school spirit, and not because I needed to do laundry. Listen: we have no mascot. We can never have a mascot because our teams are idiotically named after a color. We’re at a serious deficit at these games already.So even though I’m a whining champ, even though there are ants infesting my room in a school richer than most countries, even though Eliot dinner runs out around 6:15, even though I think the Core Office loves it when I hate my classes, I am going to get over myself and relive my pre-frosh excitement. Go Harvard, damn it.

The relationship between Harvard University Dining Services and Harvard students is rarely free of problems. Think dining hours, the nutritional information cards, and the endless varieties of squash. But Ted A. Meyer, the executive director of HUDS, wants you to know something: they’re listening. Enter the HUDS Web site. The Web site’s feedback page is the newest way for HUDS to stay in touch with students, joining established means like comment cards and surveys. “There’s no one method of preferred communication,” Meyer says. “Everyone has their own and we try to have as many avenues as possible.” Since it was revamped in 2005 by design firm mediumbold, the HUDS Web site has become an integral source of information for the administrators and students alike. With sleek graphics and fun facts, it displays detailed menus and nutritional information. Students can order meals to go and arrange for their pick-up at dining halls across the campus. And Meyer “dialogues” through weekly posts on the HUDS blog.Last semester, students in the Environmental Science and Public Policy 10. “Environmental Policy” examined HUDS as a case study, anticipating how the Web site may increase awareness about sustainability. Tiziana Smith ’11, a student in ESPP 10, was among the students who presented to the HUDS staff. “We wanted to streamline the Web site and make it more user-friendly,” she explains. Some of their suggestions included more frequent updates and developing a rollover menu on the home page with nutritional information. Meyer is working with Crista Martin, HUDS director of marketing and communications, to implement these recommendations. “In all our efforts we are trying to give people the breadth of information they are looking for, to continue to tell you about the food and the services and the people,” she says. So there’s no need to wonder whether the main course is acorn or butternut squash next time; the answer is just a few clicks away.

We are sure you all read Our Queen Drew Faust’s concise 2,051 word e-mail last week, regarding the Allston expansion, allegations of an inappropriate relationship with Registrar Barry S. Kane, and the replacement of the Chinese “wang” statue in front of Boylston with bronzes of Prestige and Mobility writers Vinnie and Danny. Although Our Queen Drew Faust may want to cut and run from Allston, our real president has urged us to stimulate the Obamaconomy and raise America’s GNH (Gross National Hope). We have an Obamananza of shovel-ready projects specifically for Allston that will address the real needs of Harvard undergraduates, as Prestige and Mobility have seen them since the Obamanauguration. Our Queen Drew Faust must heed the call of our Commander-in-Chief and take arms against custodial layoffs, Allston resident oppression, the lack of fresh orchids in the Faculty Club bathrooms, the Harvard Men’s Basketball season, and other activities detrimental to Hope. 1. Harvard must begin with its most shovel-ready projects: holes. For example, with China’s increasing prominence in global commerce, Harvard could benefit from having the only hole that would pass through the center of the earth to China. This measure would greatly boost Harvard’s primary source of income: Asian tourists. Additional diggers could make large holes camouflaged with leaves and twigs to catch Allston’s indigenous bears, which Harvard could then domesticate and train, producing the next generation of TFs and Dorm Crew captains. 2. Harvard can also use the Allston expansion to address Harvard students’ lack of social skills. The centerpiece would be the “Chiappini and Bilotti Memorial Dining Hall Etiquette Institute.” Bilotti has already volunteered to teach the introductory course, “How to Get a Slice of Freaking Pizza Without Holding Up the Whole Goddamn Line, Jabroni,” followed by the advanced course, “Seriously, Don’t Fish Out All the Shrimp From the Dishes That Have Shrimp.” Chiappini teaches the alternate introductory course, “It is Not Okay to Float In and Out of the Serving Line as You See Spaces Open Up.” All students will be required to take the capstone military history course, “The Gastrointestinal Campaigns of General Gao.” 3. A companion institute could address the conversational Groundhog Day that all Harvard undergraduates live in. This institute could rid Harvardians of the classic conversation crutches: summer plans, work complaints, sleep complaints, dining hall complaints, praise for the caring professionals at UHS, and what biddy Michael K. Jaskiw ’09, recruited Caltech athlete, is grillin’. [1] Instead, students will learn to try new topics by discussing two randomly drawn Apples to Apples cards. Conversation will certainly steam up when someone draws the green card “tasty” and the red card “Helen Keller.” 4. Harvard students have been clamoring for a bona fide student union since before integration! Now is the hour to feed the beast! Imagine a student union that is a blend of an amusement park and a twelve-year-old’s Jar Jar Binks-themed birthday party. Me-sa wants a big underwater rollie coastie. Imagine all-a the food-a being cotton candy and gummies shaped liked me-sa, Jar Jar Binks! Exskweeze me! Me-sa needing never-ending snow cone and a giant gumdroppa palace, but in this economic climate, I hardly believe it would be worth the long-term effect to our investment capital to build an underwater rollie coastie. O-kee day? [2] 5. Ahem, the problem with Harvard’s student body is that we have too many do-gooders and not enough projects for them. Enter the “Sisyphean Institute for Public Works”. Imagine one student group running a soup kitchen with a rival group training Business School students to steal soup. [3] The institute could fund one organization that teaches inmates to read and another that just teaches them how to find a study guide before the final. Remember, it doesn’t matter whether the projects are useful. We only need them to cost money and to start quickly. 6. Finally, Harvard can use the Allston expansion to return to its religious roots. We can meet students where they are right now, spiritually, by building the First Church of Speeism, founded on faith in Mammon. Of course, it would be non-denominational: all currencies would be welcome. Accompanied by techno hymns, new members would be baptized with hair gel and issued an EU passport. They would then ritually remove their undershirts and offer libations to the Almighty Moolah—while grinding with a drunk freshman. Our Queen Drew Faust, now is your chance to make a great leap forward. We understand you are nervous about managing all of these enormous projects. However, we know one brave little Gungan who is up to this task. Uh oh, ME-SA BACK! [1] Hint: It’s making Registrar Barry S. Kane very jealous.[2] Dear Microsoft, Thank you for installing Jar Jar Binksian in Microsoft Word.[3] Let’s do luuuuuuuuuuuunch.

It is 7:30 p.m. on a Thursday night, and the threat of encroaching deadlines and hard-fisted professors has forced most students back to the safety of their dorm rooms and library study carrels. However, at the Let’s Go office, located within the Harvard Student Agencies building on Mt. Auburn, three editors are typing diligently on computers aligned neatly along the sides of the office’s large communal cubicles, engaged in a different kind of work. Even though the Let’s Go team has yet to finish selecting their team of editors and researcher-writers for 2009, they are already laying the groundwork for the next set of upcoming guides. “I’ve been in the process of planning out my guides for the past couple of weeks, which is an enormous undertaking,” said managing editor Mary C. Potter ’11, adding that she has even gone into bookstores to scope out the competition. This ambition has distinguished the publication since 1960, when an entrepreneurial student, G. Oliver Koppell ’62, distributed the first Let’s Go guide to Europe. Over five decades, the student-run company has published 49 travel guides, covering countries as far-reaching as Thailand and Portugal. And despite its broad appeal, Let’s Go has also managed to retain a focus on students­­; in addition to undergraduates managing production, student researcher-writers are dispatched to ensure that the product is friendly for fellow travelers on a tight budget.  FOR STUDENTS, BY STUDENTSAlthough Let’s Go prides itself on a “witty, irreverent, and candid tone and style,” according to publishing director Laura M. Gordon ’09, their success actually depends on the cohesion of their staff of 75 students. For example, editors and researcher-writers, who provide much of the content featured in the guides, stay in frequent contact, despite the fact that editors remain in Cambridge while researchers are away traveling. “It’s a long-distance relationship,” said Nathaniel S. Rakich ’10, managing editor for Let’s Go and a Crimson Editorial editor. “It might seem tough, but many great marriages are often made out of such relationships.”However, Let’s Go is also hoping to create more positions that are geared towards supporting researcher-writers, who are required to travel alone. This policy encourages them to assimilate into the local culture and environment without the distraction of a travel companion. “It’s amazing but also very lonely,” said Vincent M. Chiappini ’09, who is also am FM columnist, of his experience as a researcher-writer in France. “At one point I hadn’t spoken English face-to-face with another native speaker for three weeks.” The end result is a resource that facilitates shoestring travel. “You probably won’t find the nicest restaurants in the guides, which makes sense if you’re a student traveler,” said Emily W. Cunningham ’09, a researcher-writer in 2007 and a Crimson Sports editor.A ROCKY ROADTraveling on HSA’s dime may seem like a dream opportunity, but Let’s Go has experienced its share of tragedy. In 2001, Haley S. Surti ’01 was killed in a bus accident in Peru while researching for Let’s Go. Since then, the company has banned night travel and given mandatory self-defense training to all researchers before they go out on the road. The company also maintains a strict “all hours” contact policy, under which a designated member of staff at headquarters mans an emergency cell phone 24/7. As an added measure, the staffer is barred from drinking alcohol and riding the T during their shift. Let’s Go has also had issues with publishing firms. After St. Martin’s Press terminated their 25-year relationship when internally commissioned focus groups evaluated the guides as “frivolous” and “silly,” they have shifted their business to Avalon Travel, a specialist in travel publications within Perseus Books Group. “They’ve been really phenomenal so far,” Potter said of the company’s new publisher. “Avalon is really supportive of our new focus on study abroad and they are very committed to bringing our student mission to the fore.” Although this recent change in publishers has coincided with the economic downturn, Potter believes that the challenge can actually be an advantage. “Let’s Go will also probably attract a wider readership, as more people will be traveling according to a student’s guide and budget.” A growing focus on study abroad at Harvard is also likely to help keep Let’s Go afloat. “Students are not going to stop studying abroad because of the economic situation,” Rakich said. Gordon is even more optimistic. “If anything, the numbers of traveling students will increase in the next few years,” she said.LET’S GO FURTHERBacked by a new publishing firm and a staff of dedicated students, Let’s Go is getting ready to stay on the travel guide scene with more than 10 new titles on the shelves by November 2009. The organization has also recently re-launched their Web site, and they are uploading new information daily in an effort to become more accessible to their growing readership. Despite these changes, Let’s Go remains focused on their commitment to student travel and a personal element in their books. “We want our guides to serve not only as an informed voice, but also as a friend on the shoulder of our loyal readers,” Gordon explained. This quality is what the team behind Let’s Go hopes will keep the publication fresh in years to come. “It’s very exciting that we’re able to carry this project through three generations and it never gets old,” Rakich said. “I see Let’s Go surviving at least another 50 years.”

Harvard Law School announced yesterday that a new $6 million dollar fund to support international legal education will be established from a donation made by Law School alumni John F. Cogan ’49 during last year’s record breaking capital campaign.
The fund will support a wide variety of international programs, including financial aid for international students, and student and faculty research.
The fund was set up without strict parameters as to how the money is to be spent, administrators at the Law School said, due to the changing nature of international law and the school’s global efforts.
“Jack [Cogan] wants the school to be able to support what the school thinks is most important, so he’s written the rules with some flexibility,” said Law Professor William P. Alford who is also the vice-dean for international legal studies.
But he added that it seemed likely that at least some of the fund would be initially directed towards supporting financial aid programs for foreign students due to the slowing economy and the gift’s emphasis on international programs.
Cogan, who spent his career working as an attorney in the United States and a medley of foreign nations, said he viewed international law as the future of the field.
“It stems from not just the issue of globalization but the spread of law as an international force,” Cogan said.
The law school Dean and faculty will examine the school’s programs to determine which ones might fit Cogan’s parameters and receive support from the fund, said Steve Oliveira, the associate dean for development and alumni relations.
The fund would also likely be used to strengthen the law school’s ties to foreign law schools by expanding exchange programs and funding international conferences, officials said.
According to the fall 2007 enrollment data, 281 international students were enrolled at the law school, or about 15 percent of the student body.
Financial aid officials at the Law School could not be reached for comment late yesterday.
Cogan, a prolific Boston-area philanthropist and Harvard donor, is no stranger to university donations. He has served as chair and vice-chair of two Law School capital campaigns and has endowed two professorships in his name, one currently held by University Professor Stephen Greenblatt and Law School Professor John C. Coates.
Despite the departure of Law School Dean Elena Kagan and other top faculty members for the Obama administration, Cogan said he remained confident in the school’s ability to retain its status as one of the nation’s best law schools.
“It’s a vote of confidence in the school,” Cogan said. “It’s just an extraordinary school, its standing singular in so many teaching programs and with a terrific student body.”

Many associate Darwin with game theory, genes and the survival of the fittest. But, University of Cambridge Professor Emeritus Gillian Beer, spoke last night of a creative and empathetic Darwin who wondered at the inner lives of oysters. Beer’s talk, entitled “Darwin and the Consciousness of Others,” acknowledged the popular view that Darwin is “the man who banished mind from the universe.”But, instead of a man who saw only mechanistic natural selection, Beer said that Darwin was preoccupied with similarities of consciousness between creatures. He believed that his greatest discovery was that all animals were kin, and wondered whether an awareness of the continuity of related species could assuage the pain of death.Humanities Center Director and Professor Homi K. Bhabha called the literary critic a “magnificent archaeologist of the soul of the scientist.”Beer said that in Darwin’s writings he used imaginative language to achieve a “reverse anthropomorphism” that nurtured empathy between humans and other living beings. For example, he once observed a plant recoiling in “disgust” from a zinc plate.According to Beer, Darwin used this language because he believed that living creatures were difficult to understand, and acted on more than just instinct. He believed that oysters and polyps and plants possessed some free will. Beer paraphrased Darwin’s response to a colleague who believed wasps to be mechanical rather than conscious beings: “Good heavens, is it disputed that a wasp has this much intellect?”Darwin was also intensely interested in the consciousness of other humans, including children and indigenous people. Near the time Darwin wrote about the free will of oysters, he was intrigued by his indigenous companions who attributed free will to a pot that would not boil potatoes in high altitude.Beer connected Darwin’s imagination and science with fictional narratives, for which he had a “voracious appetite.” Her work has shown both the importance of narratives in Darwin’s scientific writing and the importance of his theory of evolution to Victorian writers.English Professor Leah Price ’91, who invited Beer to campus, added that Beer’s work has shown that Darwin was an important influence on  Victorian novelists like George Eliot.English graduate students in attendance were well-versed in Beer’s seminal work, “Darwin’s Plots,” which will soon be republished in its third edition. “Ever since ‘Darwin’s Plots,’ everyone writes papers on Darwin and ‘Middlemarch,’” said Lesley A. Goodman. “It’s a rite of passage.”—Staff writer Alex M. McLeese can be reached at amcleese@fas.harvard.edu.

The flu may become a little less prevalent, say researchers who have discovered antibodies that may eventually be the key to developing a broadspectrum vaccine for the rapidly mutating
virus.
The antibodies, identified at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, target a mutation-resistant region on the surface protein Hemagglutenin, which provides a crucial link between the many strains of influenza virus.
The region’s constancy would allow for a one-time vaccine that would not be out-moded by rapid changes in viral structure. Current flu vaccines must change every year to accommodate mutations within the virus.
“We never thought it possible that there was
a common way to treat the many types of influenza,” said Wayne A. Marasco, an associate professor at Dana-Farber.
The anti-bodies uncovered in the study have yet to be converted into a vaccine form that would provide permanent protection from the deadlyflu virus, which kills approximately 36,000
Americans each year.
But Marasco, the project’s principal researcher, said an effective human flu vaccine may be ready for use within three years.
A single strain of the virus, influenza-A, causes the majority of flu cases, but comes in sixteen varieties—evidence of the great difficulty of finding a general cure for the disease.
Besides working against many seasonal flu strains, the recently identified antibodies could cure all forms of Avian flu, as well as the Spanish Flu, which caused a global pandemic
in 1918, Marasco said yesterday.
But further study is necessary before a
broad-spectrum flu vaccine can reach the market, said Paul D. Biddinger, an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School and the
Harvard School of Public Health.
“If [the drug] turns out to be safe and effective, it will be a great step forward in combating a serious threat,” Biddinger said. “[But] further evidence must be shown.”
“This prospect is one of the more attractive options for preventing a pandemic outbreak,” said Biddinger.

Residents erupted in anger at the Harvard Allston Task Force meeting last night as they responded to Harvard’s recent announcement to slow construction of its science complex. The criticism centered largely around the ambiguity surrounding planned uses for the University’s currently vacant properties.
The heated discussion that ensued involved residents both on and off the task force faulting Harvard for neglecting to seek community input in choosing tenants for its vacant holdings.
Community members clamored for Harvard to discontinue its buying of properties until the science complex is complete, but Christopher M. Gordon—chief operating officer for Harvard’s Allston Development Group—refused to make a commitment. 
“I don’t think a moratorium on acquisitions is the right move for a 50-year plan,” said Gordon.
Residents demanded regular reports detailing Harvard’s property holdings and plans for finding tenants. While Gordon said that 85 percent of Harvard’s leasable property is occupied, he was unable to provide a specific definition of “leasable” and could not say what proportion of Harvard’s total Allston property is set aside for future construction use. He said that Harvard will be able to provide the information within the next week.
Task force member Harry Mattison criticized Harvard for failing to pursue tenants that fulfill a vision of attracting businesses and revitalizing the neighborhood. He noted that last summer, the University leased one of its buildings just off of Western Ave. to Finale Dessert Company—for use not as an eatery, but as a central pastry kitchen.
Residents also faulted Harvard for failing to fully utilize its resources—such as its professors and students—to brainstorm ways to help the neighborhood.
Allston resident and task force member Bruce E. Houghton told Harvard it was “sitting on an enormous pot of gold” and has thus far been “a negative force in the community.”
“There is a resistance to engage all the resources of [the University],” Houghton said. He added that Harvard could improve the tone of its relationship with the community by taking the initiative to put together a package of ideas to benefit the neighborhood, rather than just relying on community proposals.
But Gordon—who answered most of the community’s concerns about Harvard’s actions—said that “we actually view the tone and the relationship in Allston as pretty good,” drawing snorts, scoffs, and chuckles from the packed audience. 
Many residents expressed concern that the slowing of the science complex—which has forced stem cell researchers to stay temporarily on the Cambridge side of the river—will reduce Allston’s significance as part of the University’s planned campus. 
“I don’t want it to become the University annex,” said task force member John Cusack. “If this community can’t attract the momentum that’s going to make this a stand-alone part of the Harvard campus, it’s just going to become a backyard.”
But Gordon said that “there is no goal to make Allston a sort of leftover property,” and that the University intends for it to eventually be an “equal part” of campus.
Allston resident Tom Lally expressed disbelief that financial difficulties are forcing Harvard to slow the science project.
“You still have more money that you had when you started the science project,” he said, to audience applause. “For heaven’s sake, just do it!”

Harvard has delayed plans for a much heralded Beijing office to support nearby Harvard students and faculty that was originally slated to open by this winter.
The decision to postpone the opening of Harvard’s second China office would save the University $500,000 a year at a time when Harvard is scrambling to cut costs, Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez said in an interview Friday.
Harvard unveiled its first China office in Shanghai last summer as part of a University push to expand its overseas presence, with expectations of opening additional outposts in Beijing, Mumbai, and Mexico City the following year.
The Beijing office would have been financed by the Harvard China Fund, a University-wide initiative with an annual operating budget of roughly $1 million to support teaching and research in and about China, said Todd Washburn, assistant provost for international affairs.
Like the newly established Shanghai office run jointly by the Harvard Business School and the China Fund, its Beijing counterpart would have provided on-site services and a support network for both Harvard faculty and students traveling or working abroad. The office staff would have also arranged interviews and hosted admissions events for prospective students from the area.
Dominguez said the decision was made difficult by the host of opportunities for Harvard in China’s political and cultural center.
“We still wanted it,” Dominguez said, “but we just can’t afford it now.”
Dominguez added that the move was part of a series of decisions to scale back on planned international expansions, though he said the other cutbacks had non-financial motivations as well.
Plans for year-round offices in both Mumbai and Mexico City, for example, have been scrapped in favor of facilities open only during the summer.
It is unclear when the University will be able to resume its aggressive international expansion efforts, but Harvard’s vision for an established international expansion efforts, but Harvard’s vision for an established presence may only be deferred, as the University grapples with a projected endowment decline for the next fiscal year.
“I consider this a postponement, not a cancellation,” Washburn said. “But it is an indefinite postponement.”
The University currently supports about 20 offices in 10 different countries including Argentina, Japan, and several Western European nations.
William C. Kirby, the Harvard China Fund’s director, said that he intends to expand the existing office in Shanghai before acting on plans for a second office in Beijing. The envisioned Harvard Shanghai Center—a joint venture with the Business School—will be the largest University-wide facility overseas when it opens in 2010, Kirby said.

In an attempt to reduce its budget for next year by $12 million, Harvard College Library—which manages the circulation of over 11 million items—will shuffle personnel to streamline its services, and will likely be unable to avoid layoffs this spring.For now, the move will require the displacement of the 17 workers in the Widener serial services division, which catalogs incoming periodicals, to a Central Square facility currently occupied by HCL’s technical services unit, according to HCL spokeswoman Beth Brainard.To encourage further cost-cutting, administrators and senior managers of HCL—a centralized group of libraries within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—are eliminating print subscriptions for materials that can be found online, ceasing unnecessary purchases of duplicate books, and making reductions in binding, shelving, and storage of materials.HCL is also running a pilot program that shares research librarians between Cabot, Lamont, and Widener libraries.The program, which may cut costs, will encourage collaboration between librarians and will help fill staff vacancies remaining empty as a result of the staff hiring freeze announced in November, Brainard said.In addition, HCL will stop manually sifting and processing individual issues of common periodicals when they arrive at the library. Though less vigilant processing poses a “bit of a risk,” Brainard said staff could be put to better use by focusing on the more unpredictable, uncommon serials.The cost reduction measures come after Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’s December request for 10 to 15 percent reductions in department and center budgets for the fiscal year beginning in July.In a recent State of the Library meeting, HCL head administrator Nancy M. Cline said that it would be hard to slash budgets through large-scale cuts of either fixed costs or personnel and collections budgets. Instead, library administrators appear to be looking to encourage structural efficiency as a means of wringing savings from their ledgers. “A simple solution is not in front of appear to be looking to encourage structural efficiency as a means of wringing savings from their ledgers. “A simple solution is not in front of us,” Cline said, emphasizing the implementation of a variety of cross-library initiatives, among them the consolidation of the serials management and technical services units.But as for the serials services unit now bound for Central Square, the move which is apparently aimed at consolidation may be a precursor to dissolution, according to a staff worker in the library system who asked not to be named in order to protect his relationship with the University.The individual said he fears that his future position in the Central Square facility will be a watered-down version of his original job, and indicative of a slow, but purposeful, diminishment of the serials services division.The concern comes less than a week after the University delivered early retirement incentive packages to 1,600 staffers, opening a 45-day decision window for those eligible. The possibility of layoffs will be considered after the decision window closes in early April, and it is unlikely that HCL will be left untouched.“[I]t is apparent there is no way to protect HCL’s workforce from reductions,” Cline said at the State of the Library. “This is the very last thing we would like to do, but there seems to be no other way to achieve the budget savings we must reach.”—Staff writer Esther I.

The Stressbusters, a division of UHS’s Center for Wellness, gave out massages in Lamont café today from 2-4.  The group handed out shirts (Got Sleep?, it read), passed out information, and had a short survey about wellness and strategies to cope with stress.  Irked students looked jealously upon the blissful faces of those who stepped up to try it out.
One problem though: While I applaud the group for diving straight into the thick of Harvard stress, is it at all possible to de-stress when, as soon as you open your eyes, you’re confronted by some poor freshman passed out on his textbook….at 3pm?
