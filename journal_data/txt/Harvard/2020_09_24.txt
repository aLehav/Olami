Best known for his 2017 film “Call Me By Your Name,” director Luca Guadagnino made his television debut last week with the premiere of his new HBO series “We Are Who We Are.” From the show’s first moments, we can sense a parallel between the two.
The first shot, set at an airport lost and found, features a close-up of Fraser Wilson (Jack Dylan Grazer), earbuds in, anxiously twirling bleach-blond hair with painted fingernails. We learn he is an army brat being forced to move to Chioggia, Italy, where the latter half of his “good cop, bad cop” lesbian mom duo has been named commander of a U.S. military base. As the camera focuses in on our awkward protagonist’s even more awkward mustache, we hear “I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky," — complete with bright, staccato brass punches and cascading piano rounds characteristic of composer John Adams, who wrote the iconic opening track of CMBYN, “Hallelujah Junction.”
From minute one, presented with a knock-off Timothée Chalamet, we expect Guadagnino’s signature story of an angsty young man grappling with unrequited gay love. Where CMBYN is a rustic, timeless love story, “We Are Who We Are” takes place in a much more on-the-grid, present-day setting, where elements such as iPhones, high school life, and military officers make things a lot less idyllic. While a “CMBYN-but-modern” premise is ostensibly intriguing to pursue, the premiere falls short in execution: By doing a poor job of painting American teen life and presenting a protagonist with a few too many layers of trauma, the premiere is unable to connect realistically to a teen audience.
The first issue is the clear lack of young people writing the dialogue. Take this clichè after-school chat between Caitlin and Brittany, two girls Fraser eventually befriends:
Brittany: Did you see Sam’s necklace?
Caitlin: No?
Brittany: I think he’s wearing it for you. It’s his way of saying I’m chained to your love. 
Caitlin: I don’t like necklaces. And, I don’t believe in love. 
The whole episode is full of this poorly-written “teen banter,” especially from the male jock stereotypes who joke about people as if they’re not in earshot and tease Fraser for his t-shirt, among other outdated heteronormative bully antics. This is especially disappointing coming from HBO, a network that has done really well with taking on youth culture in the past (see: “Euphoria”). Even worse, the delivery of these poorly written lines is consistently forced and awkward; no real teenager talks like the show’s characters do. So while the show presents itself thematically as a new-agey, norm-bending teen bildungsroman, the dialogue comes off like a bad high school sitcom. Fraser’s character does little to make the premiere feel more relatable to the viewer.
In the behind the scenes clip that accompanies the premiere, Grazer says, “I think everyone can relate to Fraser… I was blown away with how well the realism and emotions portrayed the current life of an adolescent.” This is not really close at all to the truth; Fraser is less sympathetic than he is intriguing:
In the span of 50-or-so minutes, Fraser stalks and photographs a girl he doesn’t know, who may or may not be transgender; is seemingly unperturbed by about a dozen full frontals (one of which is from his bad cop mom); goes on a lonely bender, revealing that he is a 14-year-old alcoholic; and finally slaps his mother for slicing turkey too thin, collapsing into her arms and asking her to “get the bottle.” So, while he does want to know his new neighbors’ moon signs and listen to Kanye West and Chance the Rapper, these details fail to make him seem relatable, as they don’t feel as central to his identity as his issues with his mother or alcoholism. While the premiere sets up the series to take on a lot of complex and exciting issues, it’s a little too overwhelming to feel realistic to the viewer.
In the end, each time Fraser is subjected to the tired trope of “outsider-teen subverts dated, stereotyped high school social structure,” it distracts from the many other, more interesting subjects that clearly will need a lot of attention to properly address. As it stands, “We Are Who We Are” takes on way too many issues and fails to realistically portray them. If later episodes are able to improve on the premiere’s cliché high school dialogue and give a little more context to Fraser’s complex family life, “We Are Who We Are” has the potential to become what its first song reminded us Guadagnino was capable of: a comprehensive, sympathetic character study viewers can truly be invested in.

Members of the Kardashian family have been on our televisions since 1994, when Robert, the late patriarch of the family, represented OJ Simpson in his defense trial for allegedly murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The family continued to build its brand over the years, but it wasn’t until after socialite and stylist Kim’s sex tape with singer Ray J. leaked in 2007 that the Kardashian name reappeared in the headlines. Since then, America hasn’t been able to get enough of the famed family.
In the fateful year of 2006, soon-to-be executive producers Ryan Seacrest and Kris Jenner partnered up with the dream of creating a reality television show about the Kardashian-Jenner family. The reality television market was ripe, with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie’s “The Simple Life” dominating the airwaves. One week after Hilton and Richie announced their show was ending, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” (“KUWTK”) was announced, positioning it as a natural successor to “The Simple Life” on E!.
The show, now approaching its 21st and final season, has become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country, despite its consistently atrocious ratings (IMDb gives the series a 2.8/10). It quickly flourished into an iconic program, changing the way celebrities are made and how they interact with audiences. The show single-handedly “changed the face of E!,” according to network executive producer Lisa Berger in the Hollywood Reporter. “We were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! Brand."
Most of the episodes of “KUWTK” revolve around the eldest Kardashian sisters, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney. We, the viewers, are invited into their homes, their cars, their business meetings, and — more than once — their bathrooms. We hear about their wild sexcapades and the stress of having to walk two red carpets in one week. It’s a show about the seemingly frivolous life of a (relatively) regular family with questionable eyeliner choices. But how did a show about a blended family in Calabasas endure for so long and give rise to such a sprawling empire?
“KUWTK” represents a side of America that extends beyond our penchant for “trashy” reality television; it’s a glimpse into the life of the American dream at work. The Kardashians may not have had the humble beginnings often associated with this foundation of American mythology, but relative to where they are now, the Kardashians have grown materially, economically, and socially at an exponential rate.
The Kardashian-Jenner family epitomizes the celebrated American melting pot, descending from Armenian immigrants on Robert’s side and Dutch and British on Kris’s. They came from a line of small business owners and soon established themselves as rich — but not too rich. Robert was a successful lawyer, positioning the family with a C-list celebrity status, but by no means were they a powerful, multi-billionaire dynasty like their Hilton predecessors. We don’t need to see Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, two rich girls pretending to be working class, or “one of us” — we see plenty of that in our daily lives. We met everyone: partners, dogs, spouses, half-siblings, ex-lovers, best friends, plastic surgeons, therapists, trainers. Even amid the turmoil of running billion-dollar empires, the family always stayed united, and more than that, they let us, the viewers, into their family too. We gained membership into the coveted K-family and got to witness their growth firsthand, all the while thinking that if their family could achieve the American dream, we could, too.
In the first few seasons, the show portrays a wealthy family, but one that is still quite real. Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe run their boutique DASH , working and fighting with each other about how to improve their business. “When the opportunity for our TV show came about, I wanted to do it to bring attention to our stores,” Kim once said in an interview with Variety. The show wasn’t just meant to document the lives of the Kardashians — Kim had a plan to build her business, just like any other entrepreneur would.
In the early days of the show, the content of the episodes is also somewhat more down-to-earth: footage of Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe manning the storefront of DASH, Caitlyn struggling to get pre-pubescent Kendall and Kylie in the car for school, Kris trying to book her daughters to appear on C-list red carpets. As the family’s fame grew, however, the content of “KUWTK” evolved.
DASH slowly acquired more employees, Kendall and Kylie began exploring the world of fashion and makeup, and Kris was able to book not just Kim — the “moneymaker” and famous sister for much of the show’s existence — but Khloe and Kourtney as well. Then the family’s fame skyrocketed: They sold dash, and in its place emerged countless product lines and companies — KKW Beauty, SKIMS, Good American, and of course, Kylie Cosmetics. Kendall was the world’s highest paid supermodel in 2018, and we got to see her prepare and bicker with her parents ahead of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show. Kim also gained ground in the fashion world, especially after marrying Yeezy creator Kanye West, with her brand SKIMS and her walks down the red carpet. And who could forget riding along in the car with Kim in 2019 on her way to the Met Gala as she told us how hard it was to breathe while sitting in her rib-shrinking Thierry Mugler dress? Now, Kris regularly books her daughters to appear on “Ellen,” “Playboy,” “Vogue,” and every other big name in television, fashion, architecture, and beauty.
We saw every moment of the family’s evolution, from their closets to their home renovations. Their concerns morphed from banalities such as dog-walking and the stress of buying a new car (read: Bentley) to being featured in “Architectural Digest” and meeting with President Trump to discuss prison reform. The show allowed us to witness a California family transform into a formidable empire.
The Kardashians family is a product of their viewership. They needed us to keep up with them to be who they are. Over the years, we participated in their development . Just as they remained loyal to their family on-screen, they remained loyal to us, seamlessly integrating themselves into our regularly scheduled lives. So we tuned in for nearly 20 years, and we kept an ill-rated, highly-scripted, 60-minute long show — one that eventually became little more than a commercial for Kardashian products — on the air from 2007 until 2021. The family exists through the television, and through that television, sitting right there on our couches, we were a part of that family. We were a part of that dream.

The trailer begins with an ominous ripping noise. A villain — a large man wearing all-black clothes and a matching mask — is duct-taping a businessman’s face. “No more lies” is written over the duct tape on the businessman’s face. There’s a breath, then silence.
With that, we plunge headfirst into the dark, dangerous world of “The Batman.” Haunting music — “Underneath” by Haider Ali — starts to play, and narration by Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon begins, completing the classic movie trailer build-up. Suddenly, we see the first shot of the police investigating the crime of a moment ago. Batman’s boots walk across the screen. Detective Gordon then holds up a card with “To the Batman” written in childish handwriting.
It appears that someone did not listen when literally everyone said to drop the “the.” Who would write “to THE Batman?” Is there more than one?
Next, we see a shot of Batman in full costume at the crime scene with the police. Perhaps this iteration of Batman will be on better terms with law enforcement? Cameras flash. Robert Pattinson, playing the titular Batman, lurks in the bushes, watching a man be photographed.
A car drives into a funeral, attempting to mow down mourners, and Pattinson pulls someone out of the way. Who could be dead? A man gets out of the car wearing a suicide vest, and he doesn’t appear particularly thrilled about it.
When we catch a glimpse of the Bat Cave, it looks like it could honestly be the exact same set from the “Batman Begins“ trilogy. Our first shot of Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman is brief. It’s not yet clear whether Jacqueline Durrand, the costume designer, should be fired like most who work with women in superhero movies besides Lindy Hemming, who was responsible for costuming “Wonder Woman” and set a new standard for the industry that was promptly ignored. In any case, it needs to be said that her mask looks ridiculous.
Next come several rapid shots in quick succession: police, Batman in a cage, guns, darkness, and a fight between Batman and Catwoman. Does this entire movie happen at night? It sure looks like it. The emerging trend of movies getting darker is baffling since film is… a visual art form?
We cut to a gentleman wearing skull makeup asking “Who’re you supposed to be?” With the return of the classic Batman voice effect, Batman replies: “I’m vengeance.” Wow, the character of Batman has never before been associated with vengeance!
For viewers lacking in knowledge of cars (yes, we exist), there is a possibly impressive shot of the Batmobile. This is followed by another series of quick shots, primarily occurring outside in the rain and, shockingly, even some at night! Someone says: “This guy’s crazy!” Although we are given no evidence to use to judge this statement.
A new Batman logo — in red instead of yellow! — glides in. Batman wonders out loud how he’s involved in the mystery that will most likely form the film’s plot, and a disembodied voice replies “You’ll see.” A shot of Pattinson shows him wearing a shocking amount of eyeliner, à la the Winter Soldier from 2014’s “Captain America: Winter Soldier.”
This latest trailer is mostly atmospheric and only teases at a plot: an inciting murder, a (likely unrelated) funeral that is highjacked, unwilling suicide bombers, a public figure at an outdoor press conference, police involvement, and a motif of lies. Furthermore, the villain of choice appears to be The Riddler, which has the potential to be very interesting.
While many of the hallmark elements of Batman— the darkness, the vigilante action — don’t seem to have changed, this is not necessarily a bad thing. An objectively good but unsurprising story would be preferable to one that changes things and attempts to shock the viewer purely to differentiate itself. It seems they’re going for the classic Batman, and with the success of the current trend of nostalgia cash-ins (looking at you, Disney live action remakes) this film could do very well.
“The Batman” is due out in cinemas sometime in 2021. Watch the trailer here.

On Sept. 3, Drake and DJ Khaled released their music video for “POPSTAR,” starring everyone’s favorite pop star, Justin Bieber. The video is part of the long promotional lead-up to Drake’s next studio album, “Certified Lover Boy,” which is supposed to drop in the next year. Earlier this year, Drake released the video for “Only You Freestyle” with U.K. drill rapper Headie One and the glorified Nike commercial “Laugh Now, Cry Later,” which features Lil Durk and appearances by Odell Beckham Jr., Marshawn Lynch, and Kevin Durant playing sports at the Nike campus in Beaverton, OR.
With Director X behind the camera, the “POPSTAR” video is basically a Justin Bieber lifestyle ad. Opening with over two minutes of DJ Khaled pestering Drake over FaceTime with demands to film for “POPSTAR,” an annoyed Drake “calls in a favor” to Bieber. Cut to Bieber casually waking up at a wild house party, the immortal words of DJ Khaled “Another One” and “We Da Best” written, Roy Lichtenstein style, on the wall behind him.
Lip-syncing Drake’s lyrics, Bieber navigates the party. He saunters through the house accompanied by his bearded, bald security guard, passing a massive four panel painting of himself. Among the guests are Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun, and social media personalities King Bach, Timothy DeLaGhetto, and Zane Hijazi. The party scene, with its influencer guestlist and noted lack of PPE, is eerily reminiscent of the real life maskless pandemic party hosted by Bieber and wife, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, in August. In the “Popstar” video, expensive cars, female dancers in brightly colored clothes, and the palatial mansion all surround Bieber, as he asserts, in the words of Drake, “I’m a popstar, not a doctor.” Good on Biebs and Drizzy for clearing up this common misconception.
To remind us that he’s now a family man, the video ends with Bieber waking up next to his wife Hailey, explaining “a crazy dream” that he had about Drake and a music video. While walking the dog outside with Hailey, Justin gets a call from Drake confirming the twist ending that the previous events of the video were, indeed, all a dream.

Winter is coming. But for now, the glorious last frontier of fall awaits. As swimsuits are stowed away, trees burst into reds and golds, and the sultry living scent of leaves turn to mulch, here are 10 songs for fall 2020.
“Rich Girl” by Lake Street Dive
A rambling trumpet and a warm backing track underscore Rachael Price’s appallingly smooth vocals. This jazzy cover of Hall & Oates’ first #1 song is a buttery autumn wonderland.
“Allegro assai” from “Piano Concerto No. 23 in A Major” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
As it skips and cartwheels through key changes, Mozart’s piano brings to mind the ebullient playfulness of fall. Let the final movement of the 23rd concerto take you tumbling through leaf piles and scrambling home for dinner.
“Autumn in New York” by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong
Fitzgerald’s clear soaring voice and Armstrong’s gravelly rasp play off against each other over a muted jazz piano. It’s autumn in New York and 1950s nostalgia is in the air.
“Boney” by the Storm Weather Shanty Choir
What would an autumn playlist be without a good sea shanty? A wacky, high-energy romp concerning the defeat of Napoleon, “Boney” (pronounced “bonny”) is an unanticipated treasure on any soundtrack, not least this one.
“Better Get To Livin’” by Dolly Parton
The only gift greater than this song is the music video which goes along with it, starring Dolly as a cheerful gingham-clad ringmaster. “Share your dreams and share your laughter / Make some points for the great hereafter,” she counsels, waving her audience out into the early fall afternoon.
“Kiss The Girl (Soundtrack Version)” from “The Little Mermaid” by Samuel E. Wright 
The autumn sun is setting on the beach. White-backed gulls wheel and shriek high above like tempestuous little shards of the sunset. It’s too cold now to swim, but the sand is still warm and there’s a crab singing reggae in the background. Seize the fall. Kiss the girl.
“Halloween” by Phoebe Bridgers
It’s the witching hour. This eerie track from Bridgers’ second studio album “Punisher” perfectly encapsulates the unmoored emptiness of fall. “Baby, it’s Halloween,” she sings, in a tone somewhere between wistful and warning. “And we can be anything.”
“Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver
What could be more of an autumn hallmark than coming home? Denver paints a dreamlike picture of the place he belongs in this hallowed classic of country music.
“Something Has To Change” by The Japanese House
In between the monotonous heat of summer and the biting cold of winter is a riot of transition. For now, green clings stubbornly to the leaves. But, as lead singer Amber Bain’s cool mellow voice reminds us, something has to change.
“Wondering Where The Lions Are” by Bruce Cockburn
Though it may have been released in 1979, this song’s spirit of rueful optimism could date it just as well to 2020. And for good reason –– it was written as a response to an imminent Sino-Russian nuclear war which never came to pass. Cockburn sings, “The world survives into another day / And I’m thinking about eternity.” Are you?

SZA’s back.
After transforming the R&B world with her 2017 debut studio album, “Ctrl,” SZA more or less went off the radar. “Ctrl” debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, then was certified platinum as of 2018 by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also received nominations for four Grammy awards, and SZA herself contended for Best New Artist. The album was uncensored and honest, and it garnered critical acclaim. Then... nothing. Fans mourned, tweeting, “Honey, i want some new music pls not facts about dinosaurs’ farts.” And yes, I do too, but mostly because I thought dinosaurs were extinct, so maybe this piece should be called “Dinosaurs’ Farts — Fake News?”
Fast forward to Sept. 3, 2020: SZA dropped “Hit Different,” featuring Ty Dolla $ign. Let’s ignore Ty for now — the “ft.” stands for footnote here. In the accompanying music video, the first three beats feature SZA in three outfits: SZA in an orange bikini in the back of a truck, SZA standing with cars lined up behind her in a Renaissance-painting-inspired bra and blouse set with blue baggy trousers, and SZA and dancers paying tribute to Aaliyah with an all-peach-orange ‘fit (baggy trousers, crop top, and all). This quick, flash-like editing is a common theme throughout the first three minutes of the video, with repetition of lyrics and strong beat drops emphasized by alternating orientations or teleportation to different settings and SZA in even more outfits.
The choreography for SZA and her backup dancers is unabashedly sexual. The video features three minutes of incredible dancing and SZA posing like the queen she is, moving fluidly to the music. It’s an understatement to say the video is a work of an art, hailing the female body and people of color.
Yes, Ty comes in somewhere in there, but is he even relevant? He’s the only male appearance, wearing an all-white outfit, while SZA and the girls shine in different shades of blue. Face it, he’s just unemphasized.
Then there’s the settings: a junkyard, hay bales, an empty straw-grass field, a half-destroyed farmhouse, and a pool. She’s hitting different spots all over town. There’s an almost biblical scene which shows SZA in the farmhouse surrounded by white animals, flashing between shots of her on the ground wearing white and her standing naked and covered with blood. Maybe she’s covered in blood as a testament to our common humanity, or maybe it’s a reference to the Lamb of God, the one who takes away all sin. SZA sings about being in a casual relationship, with both reluctant to acknowledge real feelings for the other. She sings that when they’re apart or she imagines him with someone else, though, it “hits different;” it’s less about the fights or miscommunications they have and more about her feelings.
The outro expands upon biblical references, where everything seems to stop except for SZA. No more flashing between scenes, no more heavy beats, no more cameos. She sings about “feeling like Jericho” and “feeling like Job when he lost his shit,” and having a “cross to bear alone.” She’s wearing wooden beads in her hair, like Cleopatra, further emphasizing her regality. She’s surrounded by pieces of furniture and wood, and the setting seems earthly, grounded and sacred. She’s leaning over a leather pommel horse. Apparently, it’s a teaser for another song featuring Jacob Collier titled “Good Days,” but it’s in the “Hit Different” music video, so what to make of it?
Perhaps it represents a more clear-minded SZA — less intoxicated with feelings for the other person who’s “wrong” for her, and more focused on self-reflection and trying to salvage what’s left of herself. She brings her hands to a clasp, as if finding internal balance. She sings, “You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out,” purging anything toxic from her “Hit Different” mind. Then she sings, “I try to keep from losing the rest of me / I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby,” then “tell me I’m not my fears / my limitations.” There it is. Poetry snaps, everybody. We’re left with the ending shot: SZA is sitting between the pommel horse rings, leaning back and reaching out, her eyes closed and her face pointed to the top of the frame.
Now to the question burning in everyone’s minds after this unexpected release — were dinosaur farts gusts of wind that could blow us out of this world? Is that a metaphor for SZA blowing our minds out of this world? Here’s what SZA says about that in a Rolling Stone interview with Emma Carmichael: It’s been “‘a wild-ass fucking year’” but “‘music is coming out this year for sure.’” An album, you say? SZA says, “‘strong words.’” For now, she’s learning about herself and growing, and that’s a good reason if you ask me. It hits different, right? I guess we’re back to dinosaur farts for the time being.

For better or for worse, summer 2020 has been one for the books. Never has it felt like so much and so little has happened in such a brief period of time. Here are a few musical selections that capture various elements of this strange, strange summer.
“Savage Remix” by Megan Thee Stallion ft. Beyoncé
This spirited, superstar-powered collaboration between Houston natives Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé is perhaps one of the biggest contenders for the coveted position of “Song of the Summer.” Beyoncé puts a fresh spin on Megan Thee Stallion’s smash hit, already the backing track of TikTok’s most viral dance in the post-“Say So” era of choreography.
“Supalonely” by BENEE 
Admittedly, this song gives off more spring vibes than summer vibes: It’s a nice throwback from the early days of quarantine, when whipped coffee, banana bread, and hopeful naiveté reigned supreme. Still, its funky baseline and cheerful tone make it a bop appropriate for the hotter months, even as BENEE sings about crippling loneliness. A social distancing anthem for sure.
“Watermelon Sugar” by Harry Styles
Although Harry Styles’ sophomore album “Fine Line” was released in the winter of 2019, several of its tracks are perhaps better suited to the warmer weather. The laidback sound of “Watermelon Sugar” effectively evokes the sensuality and warmth Styles describes in the lyrics. Bonus points for an undeniably summery — and less-than-subtle — music video that inspired many a live-tweeted breakdown across Styles’s fanbase.
“Heat Waves” by Glass Animals
Glass Animals’ album “Dreamland” is a wonderful entry into the soundtrack of summer 2020, and the single “Heat Waves” is perhaps its best embodiment of summer vibes. Its vivid imagery, glossy sound, and bouncy melody capture the very essence of the mid-June late nights Dave Bayley sings about and makes the track a definitive hot weather anthem. “Heat waves been faking me out,” indeed.
“money machine” by 100 gecs
This abrasive track doesn’t exactly scream summer vibes, but there’s a case to be made for it. A staple of what many deem “alt TikTok,” there’s something to be said for the bizarre catchiness of “money machine,” which blew up on the internet this summer despite being released last year. The track is fun, energetic, and utterly jarring: It’s comforting chaos for even more chaotic times.
“Blueberry Faygo” by Lil Mosey
Lil Mosey’s highest charting single to date peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 this summer, and it’s easy to see why. The hit is undeniably danceable and its bouncy, infectious hook just screams summer. Block party vibes for your bedroom.
“august” by Taylor Swift
A musical report of summer 2020 would be incomplete without a selection from Taylor Swift’s “folklore,” which was written and recorded in a burst of quarantine productivity the rest of us can only dream of. Taylor gave us so much with this album, but “august” seems the most appropriate conclusion to this playlist for obvious reasons. Its melancholy mood is a healthy dose of summertime sadness, ideal for reflecting on months spent in quarantine, right as August slips away into a moment in time. Taylor was onto something there.

It is often said that “Dune” is to science fiction what “The Lord of the Rings” is to fantasy. Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel kicked off an epic saga and is regarded as a classic in its genre. A dense read, “Dune” grapples with themes of politics, leadership, and environmentalism, all wrapped up in the hero’s journey of its protagonist, Paul Atreides.
Despite attempts in the form of David Lynch’s 1984 film adaptation and a SyFy miniseries in 2000, no one has been able to create a “Dune” adaptation that sticks. For Denis Villeneuve, the third time may be the charm. With blockbuster hits like “Arrival” and “Blade Runner 2049” already under his belt, few could dispute that Villeneuve is the right man to co-write and direct the next great science fiction film.
Audiences have been yearning for a “Dune” trailer ever since a tantalizing image of the iconic Timothée Chalamet brooding on a beach with spaceships in the background was released. The first look into this unique world of sand and spice is over 3 minutes — and it gives viewers a lot to think about.
The trailer begins with shots of sunlight and sand, as a dreaming Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) shares an intimate moment with his apparent love interest, Chani (Zendaya). These prescient visions suddenly shift to a coming war, as Paul describes what he’s witnessed in an exchange with an eerily veiled figure called the Reverend Mother (Charlotte Rampling). She puts Paul through a perverse test of willpower — he must put his hand in a box that will cause him excruciating pain, but if he removes it, he dies.
In a montage of scenes on the Atreides’ home planet of Caladan (filmed on the Norwegian peninsula Stadlandet), the Reverend Mother establishes Paul’s upcoming journey in voice-over. “You have proven you can rule yourself,” she says. “Now you must learn to rule others — something none of your ancestors learned.”
There is a brief shot of Paul gazing into the Caladan sunset, evoking the classic binary sunset scene from “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope.” Like Luke Skywalker, Paul Atreides is on the edge of something greater than himself. The original “Dune” novel likely was a major source of inspiration for the original “Star Wars” movies — it’s fitting that “Star Wars” would serve as inspiration for the “Dune” film almost 50 years later.
The second half of the trailer shows House Atreides moving to Arrakis, the arid desert planet also known as Dune. “Arrakis is a deathtrap,” intones the Reverend Mother, and she means it in more ways than one. Here, viewers get a glimpse of the film’s villains: the rival House Harkonnen. Massive armies, a terrifyingly pasty Dave Bautista (a far cry from his blue Drax), and a shadowy Stellan Skarsgård illustrate just how hostile Arrakis will be. “They’re picking my family off one by one,” Paul says desperately.
A rolling desert, soaring ornithopters, and massive sandcrawler-esque machines show the truly epic scale of this film. A montage of fast-paced action, set to a Hans Zimmer arrangement of Pink Floyd’s “Eclipse,” includes Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa) demolishing a room of his opponents with signature Jason Momoa flair.
The trailer promises some more human moments, too. “Dune” has a truly stellar cast, and many of them are spotted here, including Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Rebecca Ferguson. There’s even a quick glance at Sharon Duncan-Brewster, who plays the key character Liet-Kynes. Her casting received much attention earlier this year, as Duncan-Brewster is a Black woman and Liet-Kynes, in the novel, is characterized as a white man.
The trailer saves the best for last: the legendary sandworms of Arrakis. A gargantuan beast rattles the desert surface, and then emerges in all its terrifying glory. There is a moment of jarring quiet as Paul gazes up at the massive creature, and — cut to the title card.
These three minutes of footage set audiences up for a visually stunning science fiction epic. Will Denis Villeneuve and his team create a film that lives up to the original novel and proves relevant for a 2020 audience? This excellent first trailer is a good sign.
Dune is scheduled to be released in theaters on December 18th, 2020. You can watch the trailer here.

To the editor:
Thank you for advancing the discussion about contact tracing technology on Harvard’s campus in the editorial, “Five Privacy Measures to Justify Wi-Fi Contact Tracing” (September 8), and its dissent, “Dissent: Wi-Fi Contact Tracing Is An Unacceptable Violation of Privacy” (September 8). Both articles focused on the earliest version of one technology. The current versions of the MyDataCan and TraceFi technologies address most concerns raised and provide thought leadership to contact tracing technology on college campuses.
The Data Privacy Lab partnered with Harvard University Health Services and Harvard University Information Technology to design, develop, and assess two different systems – MyDataCan and TraceFi – for use during the pandemic. They jointly led 15 town halls with the community in August, conducted limited pilots, and made continuous improvements based on those experiences.
MyDataCan is an opt-in platform for mobile applications that puts individuals in control of their own data. My prior work showed that almost half of popular mobile apps share a user’s locational information with a multitude of unknowable recipients and not the user. MyDataCan changes the paradigm. Each app affiliated with the MyDataCan apps platform stores a copy of the user’s locational information in the person’s private storage on MyDataCan. The person can then view, share or use their information at will. During the pandemic, the last 14 days of a person’s location information can be made available to a contact tracer on a need to know basis for a specific case.
TraceFi, in contrast, does not use apps. Instead, TraceFi runs on custom-built sensors, not access points on Harvard’s Wi-Fi. Sensors capable of accurate close-proximity measurements are placed in the physical environment with overt signage. An important aspect is the ability to opt-out: The sensors will not capture information from opted out devices and the devices can continue to use Harvard’s Wi-Fi. Data in TraceFi are not kept for longer than 14 days. From July 9 to September 9, a limited TraceFi pilot ran in two lab locations using the earliest version of TraceFi.
Data in TraceFi and MyDataCan are stored at Harvard’s Level 4 security protection and only available to contact tracers when a person tests positive to COVID-19. In that scenario, the contact tracer can only retrieve data on the person and those who were near the person while they were considered to be contagious. Data access is reviewed monthly and reported to the University Electronic Communications Policy Oversight Committee, which prepares public reports of aggregate information.
Contact tracing is vital to help keep our campus safe. When a person on campus tests positive for COVID-19, a human contact tracer from Harvard University Health Services will interview the person to identify others, who may have been exposed, and contact them so that they can go into quarantine. The ideal timeline is 12 hours for the contact tracer to notify all likely infected people. According to papers published in the American Journal of Infection Control and the Journal of Medical Internet Research, a positive-tested person provides about half his critical contacts. Real-time location systems like TraceFi and MyDataCan have the potential to double the number of contacts and allow the human contact tracer to notify others, even if the positive-tested person does not know their names.
Details about the current versions of MyDataCan and TraceFi appear on covidtech.harvard.edu. We will continue to keep this website updated with the latest information.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It sounds obvious: Take care of your health; it could save your life.
The number-one factor for a successful encounter with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that precludes COVID-19, is health. A healthy immune system, healthy cardiorespiratory function, and the absence of obesity, diabetes, and other complicating variables are essential to successfully overcoming infection.
But even being young and healthy cannot eliminate the risks of coronavirus. Although they are not common, tragic stories like the sudden passing of 30-year-old Ben Luderer make the nature of risk uncertain.
Again, it sounds obvious: The only certain way to not die from coronavirus is to not contract it. To limit the likelihood of contraction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend social distancing and mask wearing (assuming proper mask hygiene), in line with research that suggests this is ideal practice.
These two approaches to COVID-19 do not seem to conflict: A healthy body can be the best way to fight off the disease, and masks and social distancing can help limit the spread of the disease. Yet what should have been a simple and harmonious idea has become a raging public debate that sets “personal health” enthusiasts against “masks are a must” devotees.
One side says personal health is the key to staying safe in the pandemic. In some cases, gyms are pushing back against local government, insisting that fitness matters more than supercilious, and allegedly unconstitutional, government guidelines.
At the same time, those who are adamant about mask-wearing have given rise to the phenomenon of mask shaming. Those public health vigilantes do not always recognize that complicating factors, like the country’s multibillion-dollar obesity epidemic, cannot be dismissed.
The trouble is that the discussion has turned into an argument. One side has been pitted against the other. Instead of working together through the pandemic, certain journalists, Twitter trolls, and public figures have polarized what should have been a simple and harmonious idea: Take care of yourself through personal health, and take care of your neighbor by limiting the spread.
What makes this concept so difficult?
From a psychological perspective, it might be a collective case of cognitive dissonance — an uncomfortable psychological state in which “two or more modes of thought contradict each other” in a person’s mind. For example, one might personally believe that mask-wearing could be effective but maintain a strong emotional resistance because members of your social circle are vocal to the contrary. The “mental discord” that arises will usually force someone into a hasty and overly simplistic resolution. Resolutions can include ignoring information which contradicts a held belief, combatting that new information, or restructuring the original belief (changing one’s mind).
Perhaps the more basic psychological phenomenon at play here is fear. We are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic that has caused, at the time of this writing, nearly 1 million deaths. Many more have suffered greatly in physical, professional, and emotional ways.
In a state of fear, the sympathetic nervous system deploys its familiar fight or flight response. When the enemy is not clear, or the threat is as ambiguous as a pandemic or professional insecurity, then the human mind has been known to manufacture enemies. We give these abstractions a name and a face. And we fight.
At the farthest ends of this style of thinking we find war and terror. In the day-to-day version we find division and anger. We turn camps of thought into opposing teams, and we look for differences instead of similarities.
Yet the most interesting component of this debate is that no one has to be wrong. This public health discussion is missing humility. The only real concession to be made is to recognize that both perspectives contain truth.
Science is mobile. In good science, all “true” statements are examined, and many evolve. As Columbia University professor Stuart Firestein notes in his book, “Ignorance: How It Drives Science,” “the best science can really be seen as refining ignorance.” The best science available once concluded that the Earth was the center of the universe, after all. Firestein also argues that a thoughtful approach leads not to judgment or certainty, but to a fresh new set of questions. It evolves.
It is possible that masks are not as effective as the current science claims. That might come to light someday. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t wear masks based on the science of today.
It is also possible that a healthy body is not as effective at staving off the virus as we currently believe. Scientists might discover that there is a specific genetic predisposition to one’s vulnerability to COVID-19, and no amount of healthy living can protect those who are at risk. But that certainly doesn’t mean we shouldn’t make our personal health a priority.
In the face of such uncertainty, we should prioritize our health and wellness, which will give us the best shot at fending off the virus, and we should do our best to adhere to public health recommendations, which will give us the best shot at limiting the spread of the virus. We should listen to all credible perspectives and be willing to adjust our behaviors as new science appears.
Whenever strong emotions are involved — and few events have evoked as many of them for as long a time as the COVID-19 pandemic — we must progress not with judgment but with curiosity and humility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On July 6, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent out a 3,500-word email announcing the school’s plan for the fall semester. The first paragraph confirmed what most students had already suspected: that classes, due to the ongoing pandemic, would stay online for the remainder of 2020. More surprising was the single-sentence announcement buried halfway through the message. Despite the move online, Harvard’s tuition and fees would remain “as announced”—at $53,968.
The memes practically wrote themselves. One contrasted Harvard’s “annual subscription fee” with that of Netflix ($107.88); another compared the online class regimen to the Extension School. Most, of course, were tongue in cheek. As many students pointed out, it wasn’t as if Harvard was forcing people to pay $53,968 for online classes: if anything, taking time off was encouraged. And due to financial aid, only a minority of students would end up paying the full amount.
Still, the memes hid a kernel of truth. No matter how you hedge it, slapping a price tag of $53,968 on Zoom calls and problem sets seems patently absurd.
Yet the reason for this absurdity has little to do with the learning gap between in-person and online instruction. Actually, I’m skeptical that there’s much of a difference at all: many students preferred to watch recordings even when lectures were still in person, and most professors have taken measures to increase their availability to students, even relative to live instruction.
The absurdity, rather, highlights what has long been a growing divide: between the reason that colleges charge fees and the reason that students pay them. During the pandemic, the former has barely changed at all. Online or not, there are still professors to pay, and a salary cut is hard to justify, especially given that many have seen their work increase. (One of my professors, for example, split a lecture-style class into two seminars, effectively doubling his workload.) Given that the cost of classes has barely changed, Harvard’s decision not to lower tuition could even be construed as generous. To students, however, the picture is very different. In adjudicating Harvard’s decision, most find the cost of classes irrelevant — because classes weren’t what they were paying for in the first place.
The days are long past when attending a university was the only way for students to immerse themselves in the latest scholarship. In fact, as many can tell you, it’s often not even the best way. For introductory topics, the Internet boasts a staggering collection of videos and lecture notes from distinguished scholars, allowing students to choose whatever style and pace suits them. Websites like arXiv provide open access to millions of cutting-edge academic papers, often before they’re even published. And lest anyone think this content inferior to an actual college course, consider the over 2,000 MIT classes that have been uploaded to OpenCourseWare, usually including problem sets and exams. As these resources grow, the disparity between online and university-based learning materials will continue to shrink.
Of course, there are plenty of things you can’t get online. Harvard’s steep fees unlock key opportunities for students to conduct research, in addition to being mentored by leading scholars. And most students benefit from the structure of a college class. But valuable as these opportunities may be, they do little to justify the hefty price tag. A student who spent anywhere close to $53,698 on these amenities in any other context — a summer program, say — would be thought unspeakably lavish. And anyone who skipped out on research or mentorship opportunities during college would hardly be thought to have wasted tens of thousands of dollars.
Rather, so the cliché goes, the true value of college is outside the classroom: in social interactions, extracurricular activities, and (yes) networking. Along with a college diploma and GPA, these open up a slew of opportunities inaccessible to even the most talented high school graduates.
The irony, of course, is that none of these is more than tangentially related to the cost of tuition. Take the “outside the classroom” benefits. It’s true that the extracurricular and networking opportunities depend on the college putting together a class — but what’s the cost of this, exactly? (“Funding the admissions committee,” according to a friend.) Regarding the bachelor’s degree and GPA, what expenses are there besides paying administrators and graders — the latter of whom are often students themselves, with bargain-level salaries? And while prestige is certainly a factor in the case of a Harvard degree, how much of this is actually due to coursework, as opposed to the approval of the aforementioned admissions committee? Tied as they are to the college experience, none of these factors comprise more than a fraction of its overall cost.
Now, some readers might claim I’m being too cynical or revisionary. While a college degree may derive a portion of its value from these factors, surely the majority is due to the educational benefits, rather than any ancillary features. Few students, after all, ever claim to be “transformed” by online classes. Yet if this were the case, we would expect the economic value of college to be roughly commensurate with the amount a student learns. And this transparently isn’t true: students who complete three out of four years of college make far less than 75 percent the income of a typical college grad. And according to an 2011 article in the Economist, over a third of students fail to “demonstrate any significant improvement in learning” during their four years — with the remainder improving by less than half of a standard deviation.
None of this is to say that universities aren’t hugely important institutions, or that they should solely be directed towards economic productivity. As a philosophy concentrator, I’d be the first to admit that there’s immense value in learning for learning’s sake. But with millions of Americans strapped with crushing student loans, the gap between the costs and benefits of a college degree should give us pause. If the primary expense is coursework, and the payoff credentials, extracurriculars, and networking, one wonders if there’s a way to give Americans the latter without the cost of the former—especially when the former is no longer essential to education.

In July of this year, the city council of Somerville, Mass. quietly made history. All it took was what Councilor Lance L. Davis calls “a few simple tweaks” in the city’s otherwise standard domestic partnership ordinance.
The ordinance, which passed unanimously, legally recognizes polyamorous relationships by allowing for groups of more than two adults to register in domestic partnerships with one another.
The need for government-approved domestic partnerships in Somerville heightened during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when citizens began to voice concerns about their inability to visit their partners in the hospital. Councilors set out to make rights like hospital visitation, which are available to married couples, accessible to larger groups of people.
Davis says he knew “something didn’t feel quite right” in the law’s original draft, which specified a domestic partnership as being between two people. This “something” was pointed out by his colleague Councilor J.T. Scott, who posed a crucial question: “Why only two?” Davis, unable to answer, made a few quick alterations.
“When we as a society, through our government, have tried to define what constitutes a family, we’ve done a pretty poor job,” Davis says of the decision. His perspective was shared by his fellow councilors, who Scott says “are progressive and connected to the realities of the people” of Somerville. Local reactions to the ordinance, which Davis describes as “overwhelmingly positive,” appear to confirm this connection.
Both Davis and Scott recognize the ruling as a small first step they could take amid the turmoil of COVID-19. Scott, however, is hopeful that other municipalities will follow in Somerville’s footsteps, and in doing so will “go further in expanding and fleshing out the rights” of those in polyamorous relationships.
This hope is echoed by Andy R. Izenson, the senior legal director at Chosen Family Law Center in New York, N.Y. CFLC is a nonprofit organization which offers legal counsel to “LGBTQIA, polyamorous, and other underserved families.” Izenson points out that it is too soon to determine the extent of the rights conferred by the Somerville legislation, because legal relationship rights can refer to so many different things.
Within the activist community, Izenson says, there is an ongoing debate over whether it is more productive to push for legislation like the Somerville ordinance, which expands the types of relationships given legal protections, or if it is more productive to “disconnect these types of protections from relationship status” altogether. They see the Somerville ordinance as “a good first step” toward an eventual legal system “that recognizes relationships based on intention rather than based on archaic models of family.”
But the Somerville City Council wasn’t preoccupied with the ruling’s implications on family law. Instead, Scott says it was interested in encompassing the diversity of families living in Somerville. Such families have not always been visible to the eye of the law or the general public, seeking instead to keep their configuration private. Scott says many act with discretion for fear of morality clauses — restrictions laid out in employment contracts which require employees to behave ‘morally’ and within prescribed social norms. While such clauses are “not as prevalent” today, they still incite anxiety in polyamorous or unconventional families.
In January of 2010, Boston Globe Sunday Magazine published an article on the subject, writing of polyamory, “It’s not monogamy. But it’s not cheating or polygamy, either. . . Is liberal Massachusetts ready to accept it?”
But Scott insists that polyamory isn’t new to Massachusetts.
“Families of all kinds of configurations have existed in the Boston area for literally 50 years,” he says. Even across the country, there have been such families, “and not necessarily in the models that are traditionally depicted by, you know, magazine stories about polyamory.”

Four tall towers spiral into the clouds, connected to one another by crisscrossing skybridges. Patches of moss hug the outside walls while vines and leaves drape over the tops of the towers. Spherical vehicles float up each of the tubes, almost as if they were water and sap molecules and the towers were the tubular xylem and phloem transport system of a plant. This building is anthropomorphic. It lives and breathes as its own being. As unusual as this all may seem today, it could be Hong Kong International Airport in 2100.
Today, some areas of Hong Kong are so densely populated and housing is so limited that many residents live in packed high-rise units, divided up like office cubicles, with barely enough space to sit up. Less like apartments and more like compartments, these rooms are known as “coffin homes,” a term that reflects not just their confined space but the fact that the suicide rate among their residents is unusually high.
Like most other airports, Hong Kong International Airport is already sprawling in size, taking up large amounts of land and contributing to the limited space available in the city. If the airport were to be further developed, encroaching upon what little land is left would only further exacerbate space issues. When designing an airport for Hong Kong’s future, then, one would not want to build out, but rather, up.
For this reason, we have the four long towers: Instead of walking from one end of the airport to the other, one travels up tubes to reach departure and arrival terminals for domestic, international, and, since this is the future we are discussing here, interstellar travel. While these towers are reminiscent of the other skyscrapers and apartments dotting Hong Kong’s skyline, travelers inside the airport have adequate room to relax and unwind before their flight. Spending time in this particular airport, as opposed to most airports which are defined by a certain red-eye misery, would be a memorable, even zen experience.
This design is the brainchild of Harvard Graduate School of Design students Catherine Chen, Wentao Guo, and Zinan Chi.
Chen, Guo, and Chi’s design was recently shortlisted for the 2020 Fentress Global Challenge as one of 22 entries selected by a panel of esteemed architects and designers from over 100 submissions worldwide. FGC — founded in 2011 by Curtis W. Fentress, a world-renowned architect, and sponsored by the Denver-based architecture firm he leads — is an annual international student design competition that tasks graduate and undergraduate students studying architecture or engineering to imagine the airport of the future. Submissions are judged by esteemed architects and designers for creativity, integration of the site’s context and culture, crisis-response potential, and functionality. Winners receive a cash prize and are invited to join Fentress at an exclusive event.
Airports are the focus of the competition because they are “beginning to be [their] own place. It’s no longer just a space one transfers through to get from surface transportation to air transportation. It’s a place where we spend some time,” Fentress says.
Indeed, one of Fentress Architecture’s most famous projects is Denver International Airport, known for its white snow-capped roof design, which evokes the nearby Rocky Mountains. After 9/11, its more functional aspects as an airport also proved key for it to be “one of the first airports to adapt to the new security requirements overnight because it was built to be very flexible,” Fentress shares.
Similarly, Chen, Guo, and Chi’s design also offers innovative solutions to larger global issues like climate change and public health crises. Each tower’s “respiratory skin” features greenery that filters out pollutants from smog and generates fresh oxygen that circulates around the airport. Travelers can skip the bumper-to-bumper madness of traffic jams on the road and at sea by boarding autonomously flying spherical “air pods.” In these isolated and private pods, two passengers can sit back and watch the towering skyscrapers of Hong Kong fade to glittering specks from large glass windows on either side. Whisked into large openings in the airport tubes, the pods gently glide onto a horizontal rail system and carry passengers smoothly through touchless self-check security checkpoints. At a lounge or a terminal, the door of the pod clicks and whirs open, letting passengers roam into a spacious sunlit room or board a sleek vertical landing aircraft. Gone are the days of empty runways, queues, and endless taxiing: These aircrafts quickly ascend through the tube, heading for the next city or galaxy that awaits.
Most importantly, “people from all sides see the airport as green, and it brings life to the city,” Guo says.
“We were very ambitious and willing to challenge ourselves, and we are grateful to have the opportunity in this project to learn new modeling programs and rendering strategies,” Chi says of the process behind the design. Working on this project in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic proved to be especially challenging as “we were working in different parts of the world; we came together to collaborate on this project to envision the future and its architecture,” Chen recalls.
“[FGC] is a platform for students to shine and see what young minds are thinking because they are our future,” Fentress says. As the world experiences crises similar to the high density population in Hong Kong, the wildfires in California, and the coronavirus pandemic, Fentress/source? says it is more important than ever before to look to public buildings that can adapt, change, and overcome the next natural or manmade disaster.
Only then can we see the year 2100 for ourselves and board a flying air pod into the sky.

As a child, Stephanie E. Aines watched her mother suffer from an undiagnosed chronic neurological condition for over a decade before she could get health insurance and access treatment. “I grew up thinking that this was all luck — it was just too bad that my mom was sick for so long,” Aines recalls.
It wasn’t until her twenties that Aines discovered the power of community organizing in the Boston area, where she grew up. Organizing is about these questions, she explains: “What do we care about? What’s our vision for the world we want to live in? Can we work together?” As she began teaching her skills to students and faculty at Harvard Medical School, they shared their knowledge about “the business side of medicine.” There is a shortage of primary care across the country, they explained, because it doesn’t generate enough profit for hospitals.
“As they said that I remember freezing, because I realized in that moment…my mom’s health had nothing to do with luck,” Aines says. “And it had everything to do with the fact that other people were getting rich while my mom was so sick.”
Aines now serves as director of organizing and training at Right Care Alliance, a grassroots organization that aims to hold healthcare institutions accountable to local communities. For years, she’s been advocating to make drugs such as insulin affordable for the people who need them. Now her focus is the COVID-19 vaccine — starting with the one being developed in her own backyard.
The Cambridge-based biotechnology company Moderna has received $1 billion in federal funding to cover the entire research and development cost of its vaccine candidate, which is currently in its Phase 3 clinical trial. That marks the final stage required by the FDA before the vaccine can be approved and distributed. In August, Moderna received an additional $1.5 billion to produce and deliver 100 million doses to the U.S. government. All of this funding has come from taxpayer dollars. And despite receiving more financial support than any of its competitors, Moderna is charging the highest price per dose.
Seeing pharmaceutical companies make “such a significant and disgusting profit” from the pandemic reminds Aines of why her mother’s illness was left untreated. “I have that same sick feeling in my stomach,” she says. “They’'re selling back to the government something we’'ve already paid for, so this [vaccine] absolutely needs to be free.”
The Right Care Alliance has joined the global Free the Vaccine movement to demand that once an effective COVID-19 vaccine is created, it will be accessible to everyone and free at the point of delivery. Federal officials have already announced a distribution plan where no Americans would have to pay out of pocket to get vaccinated, but Free the Vaccine activist Nathan S. Foster says there’s still work to be done to ensure that undocumented people can get free vaccines. Many also worry that certain administrative fees may accompany the “free” vaccine nonetheless, creating barriers for those who are uninsured. People who live far away from vaccination clinics or who are unable to take time off work face additional hurdles to getting the two doses that may be necessary.
Boston’s Free the Vaccine movement is calling on Moderna to openly license its vaccine, which would allow generic manufacturers to produce it in greater quantities and drive down its price.
“Moderna maintains monopoly patent rights despite the public investment, which means that when there’s a need for more vaccines…Moderna can charge whatever it wants,” Foster says. Moderna’s deal with the government already seems to signal the possibility of price inflation. In addition to the first batch of 100 million doses that were purchased at $15 per dose, the deal offers the government the option to purchase 400 million more doses at $16.50 per dose. It is unclear whether two doses for each person will be necessary, and therefore whether this deal will cover the more than 328 million Americans who will need vaccines.
Foster believes that making the coronavirus-related intellectual property of vaccine manufacturers freely available is crucial for public health in lower-income countries — experts have cautioned that at current production levels, there may not be enough vaccines for everyone in the world until 2024. “I think that these can often be very abstract issues, and certainly American biotech companies want to keep it that way,” Foster continues. “But the truth is, their insistence on private monopoly ownership of what should be public technologies contributes to global racism and inequality.”
Dr. Vikas Saini, the co-chair of Right Care Alliance, believes that the Boston scientific and activist community has a unique responsibility to the public due to the high concentration of universities, hospitals, and biotechnology companies in the area. While there is no shortage of people working to tackle COVID-19, Saini says they must take extra steps to make sure their solutions are distributed in an ethical and equitable way.
“People who are scientists working on these vaccines have a responsibility to speak up,” he says. He cites Jonas Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine who chose not to patent or seek a profit from it. “I want to be clear that we need a vaccine. We need smart people to work on it. It’s just that we also need a little more public spiritedness and less price gouging.”
Last month, Aines, Foster, and Saini all attended a Free the Vaccine rally in front of the Moderna headquarters in Kendall Square, shouting “People over profits!” as they marched down the streets of Cambridge. Although Moderna has yet to take action to meet their demands, Aines says she felt empowered by the large group of activists, clinicians, and students that gathered.
“I really felt that this is going to be a long fight, but it gave me so much more hope than I’d felt in a little while,” she says.

You could spend hours carefully curating the background of your Zoom calls, removing a childhood poster here, painting over a garishly colored wall there. It seems there are endless ways to carefully construct an image of your surroundings for your classmates, colleagues, and friends. For those of us only willing to put in minimal effort, a virtual Zoom background can be an even more efficient facade. Without the authenticity of in-person exchanges, the framing of laptop cameras can make our interactions grow increasingly saccharine and artificial.
But workspaces lack the same polish.
Even if this sounds like a 2013 Tumblr quote, every background tells some story, mundane, fictitious, or otherwise. It is the workspaces, the desks, the dining room tables, the disheveled beds that sit just out of view of our webcams that give a more honest picture of our real world. No one spends time staging their desk for Zoom, because no one sees your desk over Zoom.
Each workspace is an intimate portrait of a person, an expression of some period of transience, some manifestation of their subconscious. Or potentially it’s just a desk.
We solicited our classmates, some Crimson writers, others not, to send us photos of where they spend their days online to get a new perspective on what is not included in a Zoom frame.
Aiyana G. White ’23
Even though I do most of my homework at my desk, I actually Zoom a lot of my classes from a folding table in my garage so that the noise doesn’t bother my family. Although it is nice not to have to worry about people bursting into the background of my classes, I much prefer working from inside.
My desk in my bedroom is the same loft bed/desk set up I’ve had since middle school, even though the decorations and prints I have up have changed, so it’s a comforting space to me in that way. I think the two spaces are good reflections of my current mental state: My desk outside is a blank spot, whereas my desk inside is organized chaos. I often feel like I am teetering between the two, a mindset where everything either feels like too much or nothing at all.
NAOMI K. HEGWOOD '23
I am quite the scatterbrain and generally just a mess of a person, so my desk has almost always reflected that. With or without the pandemic, on campus or off, it would have been this messy, although I do think attending Zoom University has actually made it slightly more organized.
JESSIE H. LEE ’23
I think my desk represents me trying to switch to “school mode,” which has been really hard — I still feel like I’m on summer break. As you can see, my workspace hasn’t fully dissociated from my bed yet.
ANDREA H. LIU ’23
I've tried to keep my space cleaner now that I have to be here for classes all the time, and seeing clutter makes me nervous. I think my desk shows my attempt to maintain order amongst all the ~chaos~.
MATYLDA A. URBANIAK ’24
Depressed, stressed, but trying not to live in a mess!
ANDY Z. WANG '23
I’ve been trying to keep my desk as clean and minimalistic as possible in order to make it easier to get through my day. It’s a place to work and study, but it’s also part of my bedroom and I don’t want to feel like I’m constantly overwhelmed by what I have going on.

YOUSUF BAKSHI ’23
I’ve always tried to keep things structured and organized and this has carried on into my sophomore year from freshman year. It reflects how I aspire and want to be, but doesn’t quite reflect how stressed I am right now. I go through lots of water a day so that’s why there are still empty bottles on my desk because I haven’t had time to chuck them out yet. The tea also helps keep me caffeinated and going well into the night.

My dad’s desk that I took over. It’s always looked like this basically.
MALIYA V. ELLIS ‘23
Welcome to my wannabe-aesthetic workspace. On first glance, you might note the aspirational organizing structures — calendar, sticky notes, pinned Gmail tab in my browser. Second glance, however, would reveal that my calendar is completely blank, sticky notes are unused, and I have 1,522 unread emails. Don’t mention the dishes, tissues, and miscellaneous masks.
ANNA T. BLANCHFIELD ’23
My space has moved around a lot within my house, much like I have learned to adapt and change my plans during this time of pandemic. This current space has been developed out of a need for a quiet workspace where I could go undisturbed and not disturb others in my house. It’s pretty unorganized like my work schedule has been.
IZZY M. GOODCHILD-MICHELMAN ’23
I have started to keep my workspace much neater since the beginning of quarantine, mainly because I was used to being able to spread out/move around to different work spaces, but now that I have limited space in my parents house I try to keep stuff from piling up. I didn’t have an interest in gardening/growing plants pre-pandemic, but now I really enjoy having some in my work space. It’s nice to be able to watch something grow and thrive during such a sad time. The fact that I am making more conscious choices about ordering my workspace probably also stems from feeling unable to control other aspects of my life right now (the health of my friends and family, travel, academics).
KEVIN TAN ’23
I keep the ibuprofen close and the sources of my headaches closer. Missing my dorm decor that’s sitting pretty with Olympia right now so we’ve gone full minimal. My desk is a facade for the disaster that is my emotional and spiritual state. #livingvicariously
OLIVIA G. OLDHAM ’22
I just moved to Swarthmore, Penn. Most of the furniture in my apartment was free or extremely cheap: a free orange couch given by a neighbor, a very old chair bought on Craigslist, a dinosaur-shaped lamp found discarded in the basement. This desk is in keeping with the theme: It is simply a wooden door from Home Depot velcroed to two sawhorses gifted by my aunt. It works perfectly. It probably symbolizes my general transience as I move around and figure out my time off. Or something.

Before the pandemic, papers and coats would slowly spread across desks in Lamont. The small wooden cubicles on the third floor became little dioramas of someone’s semester — a formerly barren space that a student called home for an afternoon or a night, turned the impersonal into the personal. Those spaces had a certain egalitarian beauty: We all had the same blank canvas to fill when we walked in.
Now we are all starting with different canvases, and letting the process repeat. Doors, beds, and dining room tables have been conscripted to contain our studies and the (gap) semester’s entropy. While far from egalitarian, there is a certain beauty in that nonetheless.

In late May, Whitney L. Schroeder ’21 zipped up her hazmat suit. “It was the whole thing,” she recalled: boots, goggles, masks, and four gloves, two for each hand. She, along with other EMTs, boarded the ambulance and headed toward a potential COVID-19 patient.
After delivering the patient to the hospital, they decontaminated the ambulance: taking off their personal protection equipment in a specific order so as not to contaminate their clothing, bleaching everything in the ambulance and rolling the stretcher outside to bleach that too, then letting the bleach soak for as long as possible. Lots and lots of bleach, she remembers.
CrimsonEMS, a branch of Harvard University Health Services, allows students to become fully certified EMTs after completing the required spring training course. Before students were sent home in March, CrimsonEMS responsibilities were confined to Harvard’s campus. Members were required to dedicate at least five hours a month volunteering at athletic events, social events, and other school sanctioned activities, ready to step in and aid fellow students at any moment. But at home and away from their campus expectations, some CrimsonEMS members turned their focus toward their own communities.
Now on a Friday night, instead of facing a lacrosse player’s twisted ankle or the many, many alcohol poisonings of the First Chance Dance, CrimsonEMS members confront a gamut of health emergencies — from drug overdoses to car crashes to COVID-19 itself. As they join the front lines with other first responders in America, they’relearning to navigate emergency medical care in the face of a pandemic.
***
Schroeder’s hometown of West Tisbury is located on Martha’s Vineyard; its year-round population fails to surpass 20,000. This, however, sounds bustling compared to Mason C. Burlage’s ’22 hometown of Worthington, Iowa, which boasts a population of only 394. The EMTs in Worthington, like in many other towns in rural America, work on a completely volunteer basis. In Burlage’s hometown at least, each volunteer receives a small stipend for helping out. Burlage estimates that there are about ten such volunteers. For Burlage and Schroeder, the decision to volunteer for local ambulance services was a matter of community need.
“The biggest thing was just the need for EMTs in my community,” Burlage says when asked what inspired him to dedicate his summer to volunteering. “We just don’t have the capacity to have an EMT drive the ambulance if all the employees are doing the work in the back.”
***
Jessica P. Miller’s ’21 hometown of Madison, W. Va., has a single truck dedicated solely to potential COVID-19 cases. To keep the workers safe from the virus, the truck is “completely lined in plastic,” and a plastic bubble is built around the stretcher to further reduce contact.
Though the majority of their calls are not virus-related, Miller says EMTs are reminded of COVID-19 at every turn. The dispatcher updates the team through the radio of how a patient responds to a series of questions intended to gauge if the patient potentially has COVID before they arrive on site. Has the patient recently travelled? Has the patient been in contact with someone who has the virus? Does the patient have a fever or cough?
With months of experience at the front lines, CrimsonEMS members have gradually gotten used to the idea of working in healthcare during the pandemic.
“At first it was kind of nerve racking,” Miller admits. She is constantly worried that she may bring the virus home to her parents. “Now, not so much, I guess, because we deal with it regularly.” There have been cases in which her co-workers come in contact with an infected patient and do not end up contracting the virus themselves. “It kind of puts us at ease knowing that we’re doing something right and we’re being safe about it, and it’s actually effective.”
***
Though new precautions are in place, responsibilities for EMTs remain largely the same, and they spend most of their time responding to calls that have nothing to do with COVID-19.
Burlage recounts a particularly devastating car crash that left a patient in critical condition. “It was super, super frightening, but it was an adrenaline rush,” he says. The patient had to be aircared to a larger hospital in Iowa. During the handoff Burlage witnessed the flight paramedics run through their procedures — the nurses handling needles and making assessments that are outside the scope of an EMT’s certification.
Schroeder also shares an encounter from two weeks ago, when her team responded to a call for someone who fell 15 feet off of a roof. Schroeder and the other EMTs gathered around the male patient and tended to his six fractured ribs and small brain bleed. Although the encounter was intense, Schroeder is grateful to have been there. “[The patient] taught me a lot of important skills,” she says about that call. “Life saving skills.”
***
Although the semester has started, many CrimsonEMS volunteers have retained their local positions and are learning to balance classes and work.
Schroeder describes the different types of shifts she had been expected to work during the summer, ranging from a ten hour day shift to a 14 hour night shift. Now that she’s in classes and Martha’s Vineyard’s summer residents have dwindled in number, she has cut down from 30 hours a week to 15 hours a week. As call volume has decreased, she has more free time — even while on duty — to do schoolwork.
Also taking classes, Burlage has reduced his hours from two to three shifts per week to now only about one call a week. Because his town is small, the calls are “sporadic”; even if he has time to volunteer, there’s no guarantee that his services will be needed.
Miller, who has worked on and off as an EMT since becoming certified in 2018, has decided to take time off from school this semester to focus her attention at home. Her responsibilities include driving high risk patients to appointments or treatments. Despite the extra mental pressure from COVID-19, “not much has changed,” she says. “Some protocols are a little bit different, but overall it’s pretty much business as usual.”

Having just placed two large brown bags of food in his passenger seat, the driver of a navy blue Honda Accord, whose car brandishes an Uber Eats sticker on its bottom right windshield, reenters El Jefe’s Taqueria. I tail him inside, noticing only one person seated at a table, tucking into his carnitas burrito and another in line asking for condiments. No other customers entering or leaving. It’s peak lunch hour, and there’s no music to drown out the sound of chewing and enthusiastic taco topping requests. As the delivery man leaves with his arms full of takeout, another comes to the counter.
“UberEats?” the cashier asks.
“Yes,” he replies.
Perched on my scooter outside, I see the first delivery man drive away, fast-casual Mexican food in tow. To most, the sheer amount of delivery orders stacked on the shelf behind the Jarritos fridge suggests a business not just surviving the pandemic but thriving.
The reality couldn’t be more different.
Amid renewed and perhaps unprecedented demand, the companies that have come to dominate the food delivery industry charge partnered restaurants between 25 percent and 30 percent of profits on every order. John F. Schall, the owner of Harvard Square’s El Jefe’s Taqueria (fondly known as “Jefe’s”), frames the issue simply, “The delivery companies have developed a business model that is absolutely destroying the supply chain that they depend on.”
Long before the pandemic, Schall observed that the combination of rising delivery fees and the increasing proportion of his restaurant’s revenue constituted by delivery sales posed a major obstacle to the long term survival of any restaurant — not just his own. “In 2019, I paid the delivery companies almost $400,000 between two restaurants. It’s a staggering number,” Schall notes. Last year, in an attempt to lower the delivery fees to 20 percent, Dining Alliance, a group purchasing organization for which Schall serves on the Board of Directors, offered a partnership with all 45,000 of their constituent restaurants across the country. But the delivery companies “wouldn’t even consider negotiating with us,” Schall says.
When he first published his thoughts as an op-ed in the Boston Globe in April, there were been four delivery companies. When UberEats acquired Postmates in July, that number dwindled to three.
“They don’t negotiate with you over price. Like lots of oligopolies, right?” Schall suggests. “Because there’s only three companies that control the entire market. They set prices. They don’t compete over price. And restaurants either can take it or not do delivery.”
However, to “not do delivery” isn’t feasible right now. Schall notes that pre-pandemic delivery sales made up about 25 percent of Jefe’s total revenue, but at the height of the pandemic they made up about 74 percent. To not continue participating would constitute a crippling loss.
Schall uses that 74 percent to pay his existing bills and the workers already employed at the restaurant. When it comes to customer fidelity and engagement, Schall feels strongly that “even though I lose money on every delivery, it is still better than them [customers] not doing anything.”
And he does lose money. “In the first eight weeks after the pandemic, I paid the delivery companies $93,000,” Schall says.
“Our mission since we were founded in 2004 has been to connect hungry diners with great, local restaurants. We send nearly 650,000 orders to restaurants a day, and restaurants have received almost $4 billion in sales from orders on Grubhub so far this year,” writes a spokesperson for Grubhub in an emailed statement. “Our fees cover the cost of providing the services we do on behalf of restaurants. When all of the costs and expenses of running our business are accounted for, we make only one percent of total food sales as profit.”
According to the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, about 20 percent of Massachusetts restaurants that close during the pandemic will not reopen again. Considering this, Schall has been actively rallying for legislative mandates on delivery fee caps to ensure the longevity of the Commonwealth’s restaurants in a post-pandemic world.
His fight has been a long one. The Cambridge City Council passed a bill imposing a delivery fee cap in April, only to later claim, Schall says, an inability to enforce it. In response, Schall, along with the support of other Harvard Square businesses and the Harvard Square Business Association, was able to introduce language about a temporary delivery fee cap of 15 percent for the duration of the pandemic into a bill containing provisions to help Massachusetts restaurants. The bill passed unanimously in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, then made its way to the Senate Ways and Means Committee, where it languished unacted upon. On July 28, the Massachusetts House of Representatives incorporated the entirety of the delivery fee cap language into an omnibus economic development bill that passed yet again, but the Senate’s version of the bill had omitted all language regarding a delivery fee cap.
Now the bill sits before a conference committee made up of three representatives from the House and three representatives from the Senate tasked with rectifying the differences between the two bills. It’s a terrifying prospect for Schall to have “three senators who are holding the fate of all those restaurants in the Commonwealth in their hands.” In an effort to preemptively refute any potential arguments from delivery food companies, Schall emailed all 160 House representatives and all 40 senators anticipatory rebuttals.
Furthermore, Schall appeared before the HSBA with the idea of a press conference to raise visibility and generate greater media coverage. In preparation, Schall emailed all 82 Harvard Square restaurants, and the HSBA created a press release to send to its 22,000 members. The culminating press conference counted about 25 restaurants in attendance, including Otto’s Pizza and Grendel’s Den, as well as celebrated Boston chef Jody Adams.
“I’m hopeful that there has been enough attention focused on this [delivery fee cap legislation] and people understanding the logic of it — the logic of it is just so compelling,” Schall notes. He pauses for a moment, smiles, and continues, “I’m hopeful.”
As far as what’s next for his delivery fee cap advocacy, Schall says he will enjoy a temporary, pandemic-locked decision and “maybe celebrate that night, but the next morning go to work trying to make [delivery fee caps] permanent.”
Trying to emphasize his point, Schall addresses me by my first name: “I think it’s going to be really important, Kevin, to make this permanent because in whatever world we’re going to come to call normal, and if restaurants are going to make it, then delivery fee caps have to be made permanent, not just during the course of the pandemic.”
For Schall, the movement and his work is more than ensuring the survival of his own taqueria, but rather the survival of the community and beyond. Regarding his extreme openness about his finances and losses, he explains, “Helping [people] understand concretely what this means and what it’s doing for restaurants is way more helpful than whatever competitive disadvantage there is by somebody knowing how much delivery you do.” Gathering his thoughts, he adds, “It just doesn’t matter to me.”
“Look, I’m one of the lucky ones. Right? As devastating as this is, as bad, as hard as this is, I'm one of the lucky ones here. There are so many restaurants that only did in-house dining, that didn't have a takeout and delivery system in place before the pandemic hit, that were just devastated by this,” Schall says. “It’s partly why I feel a responsibility to try to make this happen not just for me, but for all the restaurants that are going to be impacted.”

When I ask Sipho Mangcu, Yvonne M. Adams, and Heidi F. Bailey what prompted them to open Arlington’s first Black hair shop, the co-owners of “RepHAIRations” flash me three exasperated smiles that seem to say, Where to begin?
“I lived in Cambridge and I had nowhere to go,” Mangcu reflects. “I couldn’t find a Black hair salon or a place where I could buy hair for myself or my eight-year-old daughter.”
Bailey expresses a similar sentiment: “You think it’s just hair, but when you’re talking about Black hair, there’s actually so many other pieces to it.” She reflects on a lifelong struggle of searching for hair products in stores like Target and CVS, and concludes: “It’s very important for me that my child has positive experiences with regards to her natural hair, and that she has places to shop that [are] also positive.”
Mangcu, Adams, and Bailey, who playfully describe themselves as “mom friends,” grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of diverse hair care products in Arlington and Cambridge. The three friends had little business experience between them — Mangcu worked as fashion buyer, Adams ran a pet sitting company, Bailey is an educator — but they eventually decided that enough was enough.
“I grew up wealthy and white,” Adams says. “[We thought] let’s see if we can do something using my privilege, your expertise, your knowledge [...] and let’s see if we can put them together and do something about it.”
Enter RepHAIRations, which opened its doors in Arlington on June 19 — Juneteenth. The shop offers an extensive array of products for textured hair, as well as wigs, extensions, synthetic hair for braiding, and various accessories. In addition to providing these everyday items, the owners of RepHAIRations hope to supply their customers with conversation as well. The shop’s website features links to videos about racism and representation, articles about “blackfishing” and appropriation in the beauty industry, and even the 2019 Oscar-winning short film, “Hair Love.” The store boasts a small library of Black-focused reading materials, and the owners are eager to engage patrons in dialogues about their personal experiences with race. As advertised on the RepHAIRations website, the store strives to “provide a Black-centered space for ALL people [...] in which anyone can shop, discuss, question, advise, laugh and appreciate textured hair.”
“Often when I’m walking into spaces, I have to be super conscious of how I’m presenting,” Bailey explains. “What are people thinking? Am I saying the right thing? This is a space where you don’t have to do that. That’s the essence of what I mean when I’m saying ‘Black-centered space’: a space [where], as Black people, we can just be human.”
While COVID-19 has severely limited the scope of in-person gatherings, Mangcu, Adams, and Bailey ultimately envision RepHAIRations as a community hub for Black voices. They eventually hope to host speaker events and poetry gatherings and showcase the work of local artists. Perhaps even sooner, they plan to offer classes and workshops about understanding and styling Black hair. In the meantime, however, the mere presence of a Black hair shop has resonated deeply with the Arlington community.
“[For] Black people, it’s a sigh of relief! Like, ‘I can buy here!’ ‘You guys are here, I’ve never found a place here!’ So mostly very, very positive feedback,” Mangcu reports. “We also have white moms with Black kids [who] come in and they sit and try to learn how to do their [kids’] hair.”
Still, despite overwhelming support from Black and white patrons alike, Bailey admits that some initial critics questioned the necessity of a Black-centered shop in Arlington. According to the latest U.S. Census estimate, Arlington, which borders Cambridge to the northwest, is 80.56 percent white and only 2.66 percent Black.
“[People asked us], ‘Why would you open in Arlington when it’s 2 percent Black?’ Well, why not Arlington?” Bailey asks. “Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan [...] these places are majority Black and brown. When you’re a Black person who lives outside of those communities, it’s not easy finding your people.”
In the wake of this summer’s national protests over police brutality and systemic racism, Mangcu, Adams, and Bailey also view RepHAIRations as an opportunity to support Black lives by uplifting Black businesses. Making a purchase at RepHAIRations not only benefits the shop, but profits a string of other Black businesses and contractors.
“We use a Black-owned bank, we have a Black accountant, our graphic designer is a Black woman. Most of the products we sell are from Black owned businesses,” Adams says. “You can say Black Lives Matter all you want, but if you’re not financially supporting Black business, it really doesn’t matter. It really is about following the chain as long as we can to keep the money going in the direction it needs to go.”
As for the direction of RepHAIRations itself, Mangcu, Adams, and Bailey hope to keep expanding the business in spite of the pandemic. Their plans for community outreach may have to wait, but they say their mission persists in every customer who feels validated and represented by their store. As Mangcu proudly states, RepHAIRations is a space “to celebrate us and our hair.”

If you were to ask me what I did during my high school summers, I honestly couldn’t tell you. I probably hung out with friends, read some books, played a whole bunch of video games. I know I made a few trips to visit family in China, and I think I did some occasional volunteering and tutoring to make money. That’s really it. No internships, no projects, no summer camps. Just a lot of free time — a break.
I think of summer differently now.
Topping the list of spring semester conversation starters is the classic: “What are your summer plans?” And I’d say the answer is almost always some variation of, “I’m applying to/going to be [interning/working/studying abroad/researching] at [company/city/organization].” And if the OCS pamphlets are even semi-reliable, there are very few Harvard students who treat summer break as anything resembling a break.
My plan for this summer, for instance, was to fly home after finals, spend a few days with my family, and then move up to Los Angeles, where I’d spend my summer doing a paid internship — splitting my free time between hanging out with friends in LA, making weekend trips to Disneyland, and visiting my parents back in San Diego. And when my internship ended and I’d had my fill of the SoCal sun, I’d go back to Harvard. A perfect summer.
That’s not what happened.
On March 10, we found out we were being kicked off campus. On March 15, I flew home to San Diego, two months ahead of schedule and straight into a two-week bedroom quarantine. On April 7, my recruiter called to inform me that my internship had been cancelled. On June 8, my dad was rushed into the emergency room, and on June 13, he passed away, losing a five-year-long battle with cancer.
And my world melted.
As is the case, I would imagine, with most Harvard students, I’m generally a fan of busyness. I like filling my Google Calendar to the brim with sundry color-coded rectangles and feeling, at the end of the day, like I’ve made the most of my time, like I’ve “accomplished” something. And I’d say this fixation on busyness, on filling time, doesn’t end with the school year; I’d argue it’s a big part of why so many of us feel the need to define our summers by doing something.
But when my dad passed away, the GCal dissolved; the orderly rectangles turned into incoherent, multicolored streaks. I’d wake up in the morning, rub the gunk out of my eyes, and suddenly it’d be three in the afternoon. I’d float from my bedroom to the bank to the grocery store to the funeral home to the dinner table, as if my body was on autopilot and I was asleep at the wheel. For weeks, I felt the world around me march forward, and I had no desire to chase after it.
And yes, those weeks absolutely sucked (deciding funeral plans isn’t exactly made easier by a pandemic), but things also slowed down. I found that, for the first time in a long time, I had time to think — to really think. No club meetings or classes or work or assignments. No going out for food or gathering with friends. Just me and my thoughts.
I thought about my dad and his legacy, what it meant to live a life of meaning and love. I thought about my own legacy, how I wanted to live my own life — for my family, for myself — and what I wanted to leave behind when I’m gone.
Heavy stuff, I know.
And did I come up with answers? No, of course not. I’m like 19 years old. But the point is I really, seriously grappled with them. Not as a passing thought, not as a mental pit stop in-between club meetings and study sessions, but as genuine self-reflection. And I’m only recently realizing how rare that actually is.
***
Harvard is a place of infinite opportunity, of hundreds of things to do and thousands of people to do them with. Don’t get me wrong, this is wonderful — but it can also make you feel guilty about “wasting” your time here, about quitting clubs or changing concentrations or trying new things.
I’ve been talking to a bunch of freshmen recently. So many of them introduce themselves by saying, “I want to concentrate in Government,” or “I want to join HRO.” And every time I hear that, I want to yell at them, “But how do you know?!” Sure, many of them could be right; one of them may be destined to be president, and concentrating in Government may, indeed, be the first step on that path.
But there are probably just as many students who are wrong — who have an undiscovered love for molecular biology or who would actually enjoy ballroom dancing far more than playing the violin.
It’s like when you go out for ice cream: Sure, you might ask to sample a new flavor or two — red velvet cupcake or, perhaps, mango pina colada. But when it comes down to it, when you have to commit to a flavor to shell out five bucks on, seldom do you deviate from the same old mint chocolate chip you’ve ordered a thousand times. You become so scared of making a wrong choice, of wasting your time and money, that you go with the safe one instead.
And I think the beauty of this summer — this slow, empty, quarantined summer — was that it gave me the time, the permission, the mental space to explore new flavors.
I started biking again. I read a lot — the trashy, YA romances that I adored in high school. I watched the Frozen 2 documentary (twice), and as I listened to Jennifer Lee explain the narrative nuances of Olaf for four hours, I had an epiphany: I realized that I wasn’t actually interested in journalism, that what I really wanted to do was make animated movies. I dropped my Anthropology concentration. I cold emailed and called and Zoomed a bunch of people in the animation industry and just learned a whole lot. I also spent a lot of time with my mom. We talked and cooked and cried and laughed and I remembered how important my Chinese identity was to me — how important the Chinese community is to me.
There’s this quote from season one of “The Legend of Korra” that goes: “When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.” It feels melodramatic to say that I’ve hit my lowest point at 19, but I don’t know: coronavirus, my dad, being deprived of tomato basil raviolini soup for another year — doesn’t seem like it can get much worse.
And I feel like I have changed, not in spite of my dad dying, not in spite of coronavirus — but because of them.
***
I promise this is not about me wanting to toot my own horn for finally “finding myself”; check back in a few weeks, and I’ll probably have moved on from animation to education or marketing or law or something.
But sometimes I wonder, if I’d carried out my summer as planned, if I’d done my internship and went back to Harvard, would I ever have had these thoughts? Would I have realized that journalism wasn’t the field for me? Would I have committed to changing concentrations? Would I have mustered the gusto to commit to an even less employable career path? I can’t help but think the answer would be no.
And if you think about it, we only have one or two or three summers left! Once we graduate, we become Real Adults™, and real adults don’t get this three month break from life every year to fill with whatever they want. I think it’s so easy to lose sight of that, to forget what it was like when we were kids and summer break was actually, well, a break.
And the thing is, it still can be! Any notions otherwise come from the weird brainwashing that being in the Harvard bubble does to us, that time has to be filled in order to have value. We become so afraid of hitting our lowest point — of going back to square one, of taking real risks, of slowing down — that we rob ourselves of that opportunity for great change.

Jasper White’s Summer Shack, a New England seafood restaurant, opened a pop-up location in Harvard Square last week.
The pop-up will occupy a space next to The Charles Hotel and The Charles River Farmers Market until the end of October. Summer Shack has other locations in Boston, Cambridge, and Connecticut. Its menu features a variety of food ranging from oysters to “lobster mac & cheese.”
The Harvard Square opening comes as Summer Shack celebrates its 20th anniversary since opening its flagship restaurant.
Vincent C. Lombardi, Summer Shack’s director of operations, said he had hoped to celebrate the anniversary with a party, but that the restaurant has had to adapt due to the pandemic. Still, he said he is excited to open a location in Harvard Square.
“It was always a dream of mine to come to Harvard Square with a Summer Shack,” he said.
Lombardi said Summer Shack is distinguished by its many long-term employees.
“One of the best parts about the Summer Shack is that I've been here almost 20 years — there's a lot of us who have been there for 20 years — so you have a lot of fire going into this,” he said. “Everybody really loves what they do.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she is “delighted” to welcome the Summer Shack pop-up to Harvard Square.
“There's this wonderful little pop-up from Summer Shack,” she said. “They were longtime members of the Association, even when they were over in Alewife.”
“We are delighted that they're here at the Charles,” she added.
Jillson also said Summer Shack could extend its stay further into the fall.
“We're expecting that they're going to be open until the end of October,” she said. “The governor just issued an order extending outside seating to the month of November, so it's quite possible that they could stay until the end of November.”
“What we'll probably see more of are these beautiful outside heaters and maybe some fire pits,” she added.
The Summer Shack pop-up’s opening coincides with the beginning of the fall semester and the return of some of Harvard’s undergraduate population to campus. The University welcomed roughly 25 percent of undergraduates back to the dorms this fall.
Lombardi said he hopes to see students stop by the pop-up.
“I think I've seen some Harvard students,” he said. “Hopefully when the word gets out we'll see more over the weekend.”
Jillson also said she hopes to see more undergraduates in the Square, though she said she understands the University’s restrictions and hopes students adhere to public health guidelines.
“We're hoping that the freshmen can get out and about a little bit, keeping safe and and maintaining distance and wearing the mask,” she said. “I think the University is trying very hard to keep them safe and contained on campus as much as possible, which we do not disagree with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles A. Murray ’65 will speak virtually on Oct. 16 to students in the course Government 50: “Data” as part of the course’s optional speaker series entitled “Data Scientists, Data Professionals, Data Dissidents.”
Murray — whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center has termed “racist pseudoscience” – is best known for his 1994 book “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” which advanced widely discredited claims that there are differences in intelligence between classes, partially attributable to race and ethnicity. When Murray last spoke at Harvard in 2017, students and faculty protested his presence on campus.
Murray will give a lecture on his 2020 book “Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class” at the invitation of Government preceptor and Gov 50 instructor David D. Kane, Murray wrote in an email.
In “Human Diversity,” Murray criticizes what he calls the “orthodoxy” in social science that gender and race are social constructs and that class is a function of privilege. He instead argues in favor of ten propositions, including the existence of sex differences in personality, the existence of genetic distinctions corresponding to self-identified race and ethnicity, and the notion that class structure is based on differences in abilities with a substantial genetic component.
Murray writes in the introduction to the book that even though he believes groups of people differ genetically, he rejects claims that they can be ranked from superior to inferior, or that differences among them are related to human worth or dignity.
Some students expressed reservations about participating in the panel with Murray. Liam M. F. Hall ’23 said he was ambivalent about serving as a student panelist for the talk.
“I’m going to have to give a little more thought to the conversation that would be had,” said Hall.
“It is important to engage, but I also think that there should be a certain ground that everyone is kind of playing on — that you shouldn't be thinking any less of anybody just because of who they are," he added.
Kane defended his decision to invite Murray to speak in an email.
“Harvard is the greatest university in the world. Whatever you think about the quality of his work, Charles Murray is one of the most influential social scientists of the last 50 years,” Kane wrote. “Why wouldn’t I invite him?”
Kane added he believes it is important to be exposed to more right-wing perspectives.
“In the age of Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán and Jair Bolsonaro, Harvard needs more speakers from the right, not fewer,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard Medical School have developed a new machine learning-based online tool for the early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks within individual U.S. counties.
The COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool — which was developed in partnership with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Georgia Tech, and Boston Medical Center — includes an interactive map dashboard that color codes counties by predicted COVID-19 case count doubling time. The tool also includes a “data explorer” table which can sort counties by a variety of relevant parameters, such as 14-day new case trends or average daily cases in the past week.
To predict the doubling time of COVID-19 cases in each country, the tool takes into consideration various reported parameters, including COVID-19 cases and deaths, face mask mandates, social distancing policies, changes in tests performed, and rates of positive tests. The tool also accounts for the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index, which quantifies the health-related resilience of individual communities when confronted with natural disasters or disease outbreaks.
Zhaowei She, a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech and member of the research team, explained how the COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool has already been successful in identifying “regional outbreaks that are often underreported in nationwide media,” describing an ongoing outbreak in the North Slope Borough of Alaska which the tool was able to predict and monitor.
“People in the rest of the U.S. might not be able to notice this outbreak if this tool was not there,” she said.
In a MGH press release, Turgay Ayer, an associate professor of industrial and systems engineering at Georgia Tech, underscored the need for outbreaks to be detected early, noting that one major challenge public health officials are facing with coronavirus is that “it may take days or even weeks for humans to manually detect an outbreak.”
“Our data-driven machine learning–based solution significantly speeds up and automates that process,” Ayer added.
In an emailed statement, Assistant Professor of Radiology Jagpreet Chhatwal wrote that the tool was able to detect multiple local outbreaks in advance, citing examples in Johnson County, Iowa; Craig County, Oklahoma; and Monongalia County, West Virginia.
Chhatwal wrote that the new outbreak detection tool — which is updated at least once a week — could help contain the pandemic writ large by breaking the transmission chain between individual counties.
“In order to contain the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the damage, we need to break the transmission chain as soon as possible at the community level,” Chhatwal said. “The COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool is designed to detect such outbreaks early on, so that appropriate actions – such as closure of schools, restaurants, etc. – can be taken right away. By taking action at the local level, we can also avoid lockdown of the entire state.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard alumni and climate activists identified three central challenges facing the world today — the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and systemic racism — in the Harvard Alumni Association’s inaugural “Climate Conversation” event Wednesday afternoon.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow introduced the discussion. In his opening remarks, he spoke about his own academic history and experience teaching environmental policy at MIT.
Bacow said he also believes in the urgency of the challenges identified by the panelists.
“Image after image assaults us, whether or not it’s an orange glow over San Francisco, a makeshift morgue in New York City, or the death of a Black man on the streets of Minneapolis,” he said. “These images I think sweep away our misgivings, and reveal the urgency of the test that we all face, both as individuals and as a society.”
“They are powerful reminders of how connected but also how vulnerable we all are, of just how fragile life is, and just how precious that life is — both individually and collectively,” he added.
Bacow lauded climate research initiatives taking place at the University and cited Harvard Management Company’s recent commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At the time of the school’s announcement of the initiative, Divest Harvard, a student organization advocating for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry, dubbed HMC’s commitment “insufficient.”
Bacow added that he believes there is always “more that we can do” to act against climate change.
“Our goals must expand to include the connection and amplification of our efforts and the development of partnerships that allow us to work across boundaries — traditional boundaries, national boundaries, boundaries between industry and the academy, boundaries between individuals and institutions,” he said.
The featured panelists included Romance Languages and Literatures and African and African American Studies professor Bruno M. Carvalho; Samuel S. Myers ’87, the principal research scientist in Planetary Health and Epidemiology at the School of Public Health; School of Public Health student Caro Park ’17; and Pacific Forest Trust president Laurie A. Wayburn ’77. Stephen T. Curwood ’69, a journalist and radio personality, moderated the discussion.
More than 2,000 people registered to attend the event, according to organizers. The remaining events in the “Climate Conversations” series will take place monthly through January 2021.
The participants began by explaining how they became interested in climate-related activism, before turning to the fires that have devastated the Pacific Northwest in recent weeks.
Wayburn said the fires were an indicator of the pressing need to address climate change.
“It isn't too late, but our options are fewer, the time is shorter and the need is more urgent, and I think that the fires are an extraordinary signal to us in that regard,” she said.
Myers argued that the fight against climate change necessitates a reframing of the issue as a moral concern.
“I think that there's a sort of spiritual crisis underneath all of these challenges that I’m talking about and that we've lost a sense of connection to the natural world,” Myers said. “We need to sort of reinvigorate old stories about our place in the world and our connection to nature so that we reinvest our relationship to nature.”
Carvalho also discussed the relationship between interventions for climate change and for racial justice.
“You know a lot of the things that we can do to slow down our march of folly towards climate disaster are the same things we can do to tackle racial inequities, inequalities and injustices, right? Again: mass transit correlates with better socioeconomic mobility and so on and so forth,” Carvalho said.
Towards the end of the conversation, Myers urged participants to take part in “collective action” to persuade key players in the fight for climate change.
“The way you address power problems is through collective action, so you need to come together as a community and push on industries and governments just like so many Harvard alums are pushing on Harvard right now around divestment,” Myers said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers underwent a series of restructuring processes after winning their first contract earlier this summer, officially establishing themselves as HGSU-UAW Local 5118.
Part of the process of operating an organized local with a contract involves creating a formal structure for the union, including electing an executive board and chartering new bylaws. The graduate union currently stands at this step, according to newly minted HGSU-UAW president Brandon J. Mancilla.
“That's why there's restructuring. It's just that there's new roles, new tasks and duties, and responsibilities you have once you have a contract — in terms of handling grievances, in terms of electing new leadership, having bylaws to establish how you run your union democratically — and all that required a new structure,” Mancilla said.
One such duty is electing official stewards, who serve as departmental organizers to liaise between the union’s organizing group and workers in specific departments across the University. Though the union already had designated point persons working in each department, this process is intended to abide by its new charters and the expectations of setting up a local.
Mancilla added that once the union settled a contract in July, its immediate priority became establishing a grievance committee to handle separate workplace complaints between student workers and their University employers.
The committee assigns handlers to each grievance case the student workers wage; this change, too, formalizes a process that was already in place to serve members unofficially, union vice president Marisa J. Borreggine said.
“It's less of a restructuring than it is like a formalization of roles that already existed,” Borreggine said. “We had people who were helping students informally with workplace issues, and now we have the contract enforcement and education committee, which was called the interim Grievance Committee over the summer, that now more formally handles these grievances.”
The contract’s final agreement concerning discrimination and harassment grievance procedures was not everything the union had hoped for, Mancilla said — alluding to a key point of contention between the union and Harvard in bargaining sessions earlier this year.
Still, both Mancilla and Borreggine said the union viewed this contract as a successful first step toward protecting student workers’ rights after the current National Labor Relations Board ruled against student unionization in the case of Columbia University’s graduate student union in 2019.
Alleging that Harvard is using this first one-year contract as a “test year” to see if the union will persist, Borreggine said HGSU-UAW’s members are more energized than ever.
“There is a ton of energy around fighting for our next contract. We know no contract is ever perfect, and the needs and desires of our membership is going to change, especially in a year like this,” she said.
Union members will weigh in on bargaining goals for the next contract through a survey that will be sent to them later this fall. A newly elected bargaining committee will then take members’ requests into consideration and begin negotiations with the University anew in the spring 2021.
“I think it's important that we're still listening to people and what they want for our next contract,” Borreggine said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A survey conducted by National Public Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that minority households in the United States are struggling to make ends meet as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Researchers polled 3,454 U.S. adults during the months of July and August to gather data for a five-part series about households’ experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. In total, there were 1,750 non-Hispanic white, 666 non-Hispanic Black, 648 Latino, 224 non-Hispanic Asian, and 101 Native American adult respondents.
Dr. Robert J. Blendon, co-director of the survey and Professor Emeritus of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the pandemic has discriminated against Latino households the most.
As a result of the pandemic, the survey found that Latinos, compared to other ethnic and racial minority groups, suffered the most amount of job or wage losses.
Sixty-three percent of surveyed Latino households had members that have lost their jobs, been furloughed, or had wages or hours reduced since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Among Latino households with job or wage losses, a staggering 87 percent report having serious financial problems.
For pollsters, the results were shocking. Dr. Mary T. Gorski Findling, a research associate with the School of Public Health noted how she seldom sees such large disparities in public health research.
“We rarely see these numbers in public opinion research,” Gorski Findling said. “It seems so much worse for people than we thought.”
The polling strongly suggested that for Latinos, job losses almost invariably meant significant financial losses.
“This community is not getting a significant amount of aid to get themselves through this public health disaster,” Blendon said. “Almost half of Latinos have no savings left, which means that trying to keep their lives going, they’ve just have wiped out everything they have. Large numbers [of poll respondents] can’t pay the debt they have.”
The poll reported that exactly 46 percent of Latino respondents used up all or most of their savings, with an additional 15 percent volunteering that they did not have any household savings prior to the pandemic.
“Job loss was pretty closely tied to having financial problems,” Gorski Findling said. “So the idea that once your job goes away you don’t have anything, you know, you don’t have anything, you don’t have that cushion that we would hope for.”
For perspective, only 36 percent of white households reported having financial issues because of the pandemic.
Blendon and Gorski Findling said federal aid dollars appropriated through Congress do not seem to have reached Latino households.
“They’re not getting enough,” Blendon added. “There is not enough financial support to get through this public health disaster for them.”

As technologically well-versed college students, you would think we’ve figured out how to use Zoom by now. But it seems like the summer has made us all forget about the technical issues that can arise when our cameras and microphones are on. If any of these Zoom disasters have happened to you, or you’re nervous that they might, here’s our advice on how to deal with them. Damage control has never been easier!
The speaking while you’re muted
This one’s a little embarrassing but not the worst. Maybe you had a really great question in lecture and now no one will hear you flex because you were muted the whole time. No big deal. Hopefully a friend in your class will point this out so you can fix it. Or maybe you’ll just realize when everyone’s ignoring you. Shake it off. Just unmute yourself and try again!
The speaking while you’re NOT muted but meant to be
Okay, this one’s a little more embarrassing and a LOT worse. Here’s to hoping you were only talking to your mom and NOT complaining about your professor and their *incredibly exciting* lecture. And here’s to hoping that Zoom didn’t do you dirty by switching the screen to you while you were speaking. If this is you, check with a friend on the call to see what they heard on the receiving end. And if you think you may have offended someone, just apologize!
The Zoom chat
The Zoom chat is a disaster just waiting to happen. Picture this: you’re telling your friend about your horrible morning, confessing you didn’t do the reading for lecture, or complaining about the annoying kid in your section. Except you’re not just telling your friend — you send it to everyone on the call. Yikes! As embarrassing as this is in the moment, we can assure you that it isn’t so bad. As other messages in the chat come in, everyone will forget about yours!
The Zoom chat, part two
Here’s another scenario. Just like the last one, this also starts with you still spilling your deepest sins to your friend. Except this time, instead of chatting the whole class, you message the wrong person. So yes, it’s a little unsettling to know that a stranger knows all your tea, but hey, think about it like this: worst case, you’ve creeped them out a bit, but best case, you’ve made a new friend!
The video fiasco
Listen to us carefully: if you don’t wear pants to class, don’t leave your video on. The easiest way to prevent video camera disasters is to make sure you don’t do things you wouldn’t do in public while you’re on zoom. This includes but is not limited to: nose-picking, not being fully clothed, and using your camera as a makeup mirror. There’s two ways to solve this problem. Either keep your camera off, or just pay attention for the full lecture.
If you’re still worried about future Zoom disasters or a little scarred from one that happened a few weeks ago, we’ll leave you with this: while we hope this advice will keep you from making Zoom mistakes a habit, accidents are inevitable. If one of these things does happen to you, your friends, classmates, and professors will forgive you. And when Zoom classes become a thing of the past, your Zoom disaster will be too!
