After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Hurricane Irene ravaged the Caribbean, North Carolina, and Vermont. It also, we hear, caused quite a ruckus in nearby Boston, which went so far as to shut down public transportation for a whole day (Pity on those who rely on public transportation!). We, however, in the hallowed halls of Harvard, which—for the record—managed to stay somewhat dry during the deluge--wish to emphasize that we, too, were almost devastated by this tempest of epic proportions.
Cambridge, after all, is only a short jaunt from the Vermont countryside, the pictures of which we’ve been frankly appalled to see over our morning lattes here in Boston’s Left Bank. Imagine: that could have been us!
Irene, of course, wasn’t exactly kind to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She interrupted the President’s vacation on Martha’s Vineyard, and—worst of all—she deprived a brand new group of Harvard freshmen the opportunity to attend the storied First Chance Dance and the essential Sex Signals seminar, which, for reasons beyond our comprehension, was scheduled the night following the dance.
Needless to say, Harvard was woefully unprepared for the almost shocking amounts of wind and rain—30 whole minutes of precipitation—that could very well have fallen on the Commonwealth earlier this week. Although each student received somewhere in the vicinity of 30 emails warning him or her about the dangers of the weather—and the dining halls were stocked with far too few ranger cookies to withstand the storm—no one was prepared for the intensity of the storm that might have been.
For a lucky few Harvard students, flights that were canceled and couldn’t be rescheduled until Wednesday kept them out of the area until after the majority of Irene’s fury would have worked itself out, but without a doubt those who were delayed until Thursday were luckier still, as much of the damage we did sustain from Hurricane Irene is expected to take almost half a week to clean up completely.
From the tree branches that fell down, to the waters of the Charles, that became sort of choppy, to those who may have, unfortunately, been caught in the rain for a bit and maybe ruined a favorite pair of boat shoes, it seems evident that Harvard did not do nearly enough to prevent the damage (which under different circumstances, had the potential to probably be pretty severe) that Hurricane Irene managed to wreak.
Additionally, we heard that rowing practice was moved to the indoor erg machines. Head of the Charles is just a few weeks away, when you think about it. How will we continue our Winklevai legacy with waters as tempermental as these?
We have to ask, for a school with so many resources at its disposal, how could Harvard not have more adequately prepared their students for a storm that, when you think about it, could have really probably been pretty wild, and maybe lasted for a pretty long time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In order to pass his version of a debt-ceiling bill, Speaker Boehner reintroduced an idea with a long history in the American popular consciousness—a balanced budget amendment. It’s a bad idea for any number of reasons. But what struck me most was how strongly it contradicted the most common rhetoric associated with the whole debt ceiling debacle: the repeated analogy that compared the American government to American households, which are expected to keep their budgets in order. When you consider the importance of debt to the average American household, the balanced budget amendment is revealed as absurd.
Houses, after all, are primarily bought with mortgages—that is, debt. In fact, according to an Oprah magazine article, a family making 54,000 dollars a year may reasonably take out a 200,000 dollar mortgage, establishing a household "debt-to-GDP ratio" of just under four hundred percent, more than quadruple than the highest ratio the U.S. has ever had. That’s before credit card debt, student loans, car loans, or any of the other sorts of debt that are the subject of discussion at kitchen tables across America, as families figure out their household budgets. It’s only very wealthy families that can afford to buy homes and cars for cash, or pay off their loans in just a handful of years. It’s only very wealthy families that can afford to send their children to school without taking on debt.
Of course, Congress is composed of very wealthy people. Perhaps they are genuinely ignorant about the debt that any ordinary American family works under. But then Speaker Boehner gave a speech where he compared the U.S. government to his small business back in Ohio. Small businesses, of course, are typically started with small business loans. Any actual small businessman would understand the importance of debt to get a new business running, or to steer it through a rocky patch. If Boehner never needed to take out a loan to help his business begin, survive, or grow, he’s no small businessman. He’s just a wealthy dilettante.
But wealthy dilettantes understand the importance of debt too. The Koch brothers, the moneymen behind the Tea Party, aren’t small businessmen at all. They’re billionaire industrialists. But in that role, they too appreciate the proper use of debt. Koch Industries brags of its impressive AA+ credit rating (the same rating as the downgraded U.S.), because the Koch brothers know that businesses, too, have to borrow money to keep operating, expanding, and improving. Just like the government.
The balanced budget amendment doesn’t just ignore the rhetoric coming out of Washington. It ignores American history in its entirety. The Revolutionary War was funded with borrowed money—so much of it that in 1790 the first Confederation de facto defaulted on its debt. The Civil War was financed with debt. That’s why the 14th Amendment says that the debt of the United States cannot be questioned. In World War II the government sold war bonds, so many of them that advertisements promoting them still permeate our culture.
None of the above examples of the importance of debt was somehow secret or obscure. I didn’t have to take a course in economics, business, or history to learn any of the above. I’ve never bought a house, started a business, run a corporation, or financed a war, and I still knew about each and every one of those examples. (You probably did too, and find my pedantic tone a little condescending.) Yet a significant portion of Congress today acts as though they’ve never heard of mortgages, small business loans, corporate bonds, or any major American war.
The reason the balanced-budget argument gets it so wrong is that it’s trying to make something inescapably complex unbearably simple. The truth is it is impossible to draw a hard and fast line demarcating how much debt or deficit is too much. There’s no simple rule ("balanced budget!") or single number ("debt ceiling!") that tells us how much our government should borrow. Yes, it is possible to borrow too much, and yes, it’s looking more and more like the past thirty years of debt has crossed that hazy divider. (It should be noted that this expansion primarily occurred under the tax-cut-and-spend policies of Reagan and Bush II. Clinton’s tax-increasing administration shrunk the debt.) But just because we’ve occasionally steered the ship of state poorly doesn’t mean we should set fire to it.
The American people can’t rely on grandiose, meaningless slogans when it comes to making debt decisions. Instead, we have to think seriously about what debt we can manage and what we can’t, when borrowing will help our country prosper and when it will hurt us too much down the road, and act accordingly. You can’t fit that principle onto a Constitutional amendment. But when it comes to the federal debt, it’s the only principle worth living by.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since a young age, many of us have searched for something—a hobby, a passion, a quirk—that "defines us." Certainly, for some, the depth and aptitude at which we pursue these activities played a large role in getting us where we are today. Yet these pursuits are not solely for the purposes of academic and professional advancement –studies have shown that college students with deep involvement in one or more extracurricular activities are happier than students without such involvement. I have noticed that my friends with passions—even my two quirky friends who are jointly passionate about automotive photography—tend to be happier than my friends with diffuse and milder interests.
For me it happened at age six; I discovered rock climbing, and from the first handhold I knew that rock climbing was my thing. My involvement in the sport grew with me, and by middle school I was training extensively on Tuesday and Thursday nights and spending the entirety of my weekend climbing. Between the rock-climbing Mecca of Yosemite National Park, indoor competitions, and an international scene of climbing aficionados, the sport was all-consuming.
High school brought larger muscles for climbing, and increased sacrifices on my part to climb at my best. My friends understood why I regularly left Friday-night parties at nine o’clock—it was necessary in order to wake up early the next morning for the six-hour drive to Yosemite. While I decided to attend a college with difficult academics and lesser rock-climbing opportunities (a very difficult decision) I maintained my passion in the transition to college life. Indeed, on my first Friday night at college, while my newly-made friends went to Rush Hour to scope out the local co-ed scene, I went to bed early, in preparation for a drive to New Hampshire, to scope out the local granite.
I was rock climbing with friends from college about a month ago when my passion came crashing down—literally—to a halt. Mountaineering terrain is rated on a scale of Class 1 to Class 5, with Class 5 being the most difficult to navigate. Class 3 terrain involves steep hiking up blocky boulders, where one occasionally involves their hands for balance. I was walking up such Class 3 terrain, walking towards more difficult rock climbing that laid ahead, when I took an unexpected fall, ripping my right shoulder out of its socket. After performing backcountry first aid, my friends heroically carried me over mountainous terrain, to the hospital, where the emergency room doctor sedated me and re-set my shoulder. The ligaments in my shoulder were torn in two, necessitating a two to six month recovery time, during which rock climbing—or any physical activity involving my upper body—is strictly off limits.
I cried when I heard the news. How was a fall on such easy terrain possible? To be blunt, I barely fell rock climbing—I essentially tripped while hiking up a steep hill. More importantly, how was I to survive a semester without climbing? Not only is rock climbing what I do but it is who I am. What do non-climbers do on the weekend? I haven’t known since age six and, frankly, I don’t remember.
It was fifteen years ago when I discovered rock climbing, back in the days of play-dates and juice-boxes. As a 21-year-old junior in college, the world of my six-year-old self seems foreign: My world today involves dates, not play-dates, and the boxed juice has been replaced by boxed wine. Rock-climbing has helped me grow, grown with me, and provide the lens through which I understand the world.
Yet my passion for climbing and my desire to climb to my potential has certainly involved sacrifices over the years. As many readers will relate, the sheer quantity of time devoted to my passion has precluded involvement in other activities and the discovery of other sides of myself. It has been fifteen years since I have asked myself how I wanted to spend my weekend, fifteen years since I have looked in the mirror and decided to devote myself to something new. I expect the next months of my life to be extremely frustrating, a bit terrifying, and yet extremely exciting.
Join me if you would like—take a break from that cause you’ve been passionate about forever, take a few months off the sport you have loved since you could walk. We’ll be back in a semester, in full force, with a vengeance. We might even be back fuller, more complete versions of ourselves, having discovered sides of our lives we never gave ourselves the opportunity to explore. And, who knows, maybe I’ll see you at Rush Hour! (And I won’t leave at nine).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Paul J. McLoughlin II came to Harvard as a counselor in the Office of Career Services, he was, at 26, just a few years older than some of the students he advised.
Within just a few years, he moved up Harvard’s ladder, becoming assistant dean of student life—and the youngest administrator at the College, beating out other administrators at the time by 18 years.
Soon, he climbed higher, becoming an associate dean and senior adviser to the dean when Evelynn M. Hammonds took over as the College’s top administrator. As Hammonds’ closest confidante, he has had his hand in every major College project over the past three years.
But after ten years at Harvard, McLoughlin, 36, announced this summer that he was ready to step down.
As this influential and at times controversial figure leaves Harvard, many administrators and student group leaders say that McLoughlin has been a consistent advocate for students in University Hall even if some of the projects he has led—like the construction of the Student Organization Center at Hilles—have come under criticism for failing to address student needs.
Without McLoughlin standing behind her, Dean Hammonds might now make changes to her staff structure that reflect her transition to leading the College with three years of experience at its helm from the new dean who invited McLoughlin to move up in the College along with her.
SHAPING THE COLLEGE
When Hammonds became dean of the College in 2008, she appointed McLoughlin as her right-hand man.
In that role, as well as in his earlier position in the Office of Student Life, he has played an important role in initiatives like expanding social space for students, re-envisioning the College’s winter break, and enlivening opening week programs.
He was the project manager for the creation of the SOCH in 2006. Five years later, the space hosts numerous events and houses student group offices but is commonly derided for its remote location in the Quad.
Looking back on the project now, McLoughlin acknowledges that the building is not as popular as he would like it to be, citing it as proof of the adage about “location, location, location” being key to success in real estate.
But he noted that moving student organizations to the SOCH freed up spaces in the basements of freshman dormitories that are now  occupied by the Harvard Foundation, Women’s Center, prayer groups, and freshman common rooms.
“If you think about that project in its totality, it has been hugely successful,” McLouglin said. “[The SOCH] has always been part of a package.”
As he leaves Harvard, McLoughlin similarly seeks to put a positive spin on another endeavor which received mixed reviews from College students. Last January, he ran the College’s inaugural Optional Winter Activities Week. Though some complained that it was under-attended and suffered from a lack of faculty programming and College guidance, McLoughlin says that the first iteration of the end-of-break week was what he intended it to be, and he foresees few changes to how the week will be run.
Admitting that “winter break has gotten a lot of beating up on,” he says that he thinks the break should remain “amorphous” rather than a “cruise ship menu of choices.”
He predicts that the next OWAW will closely resemble the last, with the addition of three to five signature programs run by the College rather than students or staff. He says he has secured a private donor to fund these programs, which may include a session on academic integrity or disaster preparedness.
FARM TO YARD
Raised on a farm in Ohio, McLoughlin has adopted a seemingly very different habitat in Harvard Yard for the past ten years.
Robert G. Doyle, an associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences who has known McLoughlin for nine years, credits his farm upbringing with imbuing him with the stick-to-itiveness that he brought to his work at Harvard.
“If you went to Broadway Garage at 8 a.m., you would see his car. At 7:30 at night, you would see his car,” Doyle says, comparing the hours McLoughlin put in at University Hall to the sunup to sundown schedule of a farmer.
McLouglin majored in zoology and neuroscience at Miami University of Ohio, with plans to become a doctor. His ambition changed, he says, due to the example set by his own dean of students, a mentor so close to him during his undergraduate years that he later officiated at McLoughlin’s wedding to his husband. That union, registered on the first day that same-sex couples could legally marry in Massachusetts, garnered McLoughlin a featured spot in a New York Times Magazine cover story on young gay men’s marital relationships.
Thanks in part to his former dean’s example, McLoughlin says he aspires to a position as a dean of students himself.
After trying his hand at working in the Office of Student Life, where he worked frequently with student leaders, and then in Dean Hammonds’ office, where he characterizes his work as “more behind-the-scenes,” McLoughlin says he wants a position in the future that involves direct work with students.
This year, he will be teaching graduate students at Boston College, where he recently completed his Ph.D. in higher education, as well as working on turning his dissertation into a book.
His experiences at Harvard, he says, “helped me focus on what I really enjoy doing and what I’ll seek in my next position—what I’m seeking now is certainly direct work with undergraduates, likely at a dean of students level, or a president level maybe eventually.”
Doyle makes similar observations about McLoughlin’s priorities. The position in Hammonds’ administration, Doyle says, “did not offer him a lot of opportunities to work with students, and I think he really missed that. ... He got an opportunity with Hammonds to find out what it’s like to run an institution. He’ll be very marketable in higher education when he’s been in so many different sides of working in a college.”
LAUDED TO LAMBASTED
Students seem to have noticed McLoughlin’s enthusiasm for working with them.
“He is very accessible,” says Alexandre J. Terrien ’11, who worked closely with McLoughlin while he served as a Crimson Key Society officer. “I would even sometimes show up to his office without a meeting time. I would just kind of drop by and say hi.”
Former UC President Johnny F. Bowman, Jr. ’11 recalls, “He was incredible, really helpful, really just enthusiastic about student life and was one of the few people that had a long term vision or goal on how to improve it.”
Fellow administrators give McLoughlin glowing marks as well.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 says, “He was a very hardworking, very creative, and very organized colleague. I interviewed him when he was applying to be assistant dean, [and] I was struck then by his energy, his imagination, his commitment to make a difference. He was a great hire. Great hire.”
But since then, not everyone has always been pleased with McLoughlin’s leadership.
Members of the Harvard Advocate reacted with ire in 2004, just after McLoughlin’s appointment as assistant dean, when he and other administrators showed up unannounced to order thousands of dollars’ worth of facilities repairs. All these years later, McLoughlin mentions the Advocate first when talking about people who have criticized him.
When the budgetary crisis struck in 2009, McLoughlin drew anger from a larger segment of the student body by announcing that shuttle services would end at 1:30 a.m. rather than 3:45 a.m. on weeknights and no longer operate on weekend mornings.
Recalling the resulting uproar—out of safety concerns, late-night services eventually survived uncut—Bowman says, “There were some more unpopular aspects of his tenure, such as cutting shuttles. I view him as one of the few people who actually take charge of matters.... He had to make budgetary decisions and he made those.”
Observers say McLoughlin has developed a close friendship with Hammonds, which has contributed to a large role in her administration.
“He was such a driving force for Dean Hammonds,” says Eric N. Hysen ’11, a former vice president of the Undergraduate Council.
“He was very much setting the agenda for what she was doing,” he said.
But for now, Hammonds might not pick someone to fill his shoes and leave the position of senior adviser unfilled.
“Dean Hammonds is a different dean now,” McLoughlin says, positing that perhaps she wants to rely on a looser network of many informal advisers rather than one official staunch supporter. “Maybe she has decided that she doesn’t need a senior adviser now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Legally Blonde’s Elle Woods decides to shed her party-girl demeanor to become a serious Harvard Law School student, her first purchase is a tangerine Apple iBook.
While the make and model of the products have changed since the movie was released in 2001, the Apple brand has grown more and more popular in higher education. But with Steve Jobs announcing his departure as CEO of Apple last week, many question whether the company will continue to flourish.
In recent years, Apple products have become ubiquitous on college campuses. A 2008 study by the research firm Student Monitor found that of the college students that owned laptop computers, 27 percent owned Macs and 24 percent owned Dells. A survey of 125 colleges by Group Logic, Inc. found that Mac usage on campuses increased by 18 percent between 2009 and 2010 and is expected to rise by about 20 percent over the next five years.
A quick glance around a typical Harvard lecture hall, where the rows are often dotted with a mosaic of one-bite apples, shows that the College is not exempt from the trend. While Harvard Technology Services sells both Apple and Dell products, only Apple products are sold on-location. Dell products are ordered directly from the manufacturer.
Salespeople at Harvard’s computer store in the basement of the Science Center declined to comment on the number of Apple and Dell computers sold to students.
According to Hal B. Gregersen, a professor of leadership at INSEAD—an international graduate business school—Apple products appeal to college students largely because of “a combination of both functionality and fashion.”
“The devices that Apple builds are much more than simply functional devices. They have a strong aesthetic component,” said Paul L. Saffo ’76, a technology forecaster and an associate professor at Stanford. “Apple has always resonated with the younger demographic.”
For many, the Apple brand and Steve Jobs have become synonymous. Under the guidance of its turtleneck-wearing and blue jeans-clad chieftain, Apple transformed industry after industry with products that few expected to succeed.
It remains to be seen if Apple can maintain the momentum it acquired under Jobs and continue to attract to a younger demographic. “I think very little is going to change,” said Harvard Business School Senior Associate Dean David B. Yoffie. “The fundamental aspects of products are going to continue to be very popular on college campuses. The products are still going to have that cool factor because of their features and user interface. Steve Jobs’ departure is not going to have that big of an immediate impact.”
Experts interviewed for this article said that because Apple has long anticipated Jobs’ departure, the company has built a strong network of senior executives who are ready carry on his vision.
“Executives at Apple ... are going to have to step up and fill some of the roles that Jobs was filling,” said tech analyst and columnist Jeff Kagan. “Frankly, I don’t know if they will.”
“But I hope they will,” he added.

After the sudden onset of flu symptoms and a frantic Google search later, Hojung Lee ’14 found herself at an Anglo-American clinic fearing that she had contracted rabies after an ill-advised attempt to play with street dogs in Lima, Peru resulted in a bite on her calf.
“I didn’t seek medical attention because all the local people, all the people at my workplace said, ‘oh it’s just a bite, it won’t do anything,’” she said. But after the bite Lee became sick with a cold, a headache, and diarrhea.
But the symptoms didn’t go away. By the third day after the dog bite, Lee, who was in Peru studying Spanish and volunteering, became paranoid.
“I thought, wait, is this because of rabies? Is this a symptom?” she said. Her Google searches did little to assuage her fears—Lee found that flu-like symptoms can be indicative of rabies.
She freaked out in a Facebook status, and friends encouraged her to seek medical help. “They were trying to calm me down, but they were freaking out, too, because they thought I had rabies.”
Lee went to a clinic where she received the first two of a four-part rabies vaccination, and then to an emergency room. Eventually, International S.O.S. told her to fly back to the United States to get a vaccination that was unavailable in Peru, but would offer immediate protection from rabies. Although she still had three weeks left in her program, Lee left Peru, flew home and is now completely healthy.
Lee was one of over 1,000 Harvard students who went students went abroad, according to preliminary figures from the Office of Career Services. Harvard sponsored travel to countries in six continents and internships around the world.
Lee, a Crimson video editor, spent the summer abroad in the Peruvian capital while taking classes at Universidad del Pacífico and volunteering at a Christian organization through a program organized by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies’ Spanish and Community Service Program.
Others stayed stateside this summer, though figures on how many worked in the United States have not yet been compiled.
Rachel L. Jiang ’13 was one of 60 participants in the Director’s Internship Program at the Institute of Politics and received $4,000 to work at Resources for the Future, an environmental think tank.
“The internship was quite substantial, which I really appreciated,” Jiang said.
Her favorite part of the summer, though, was getting to experience Washington, D.C, a place that she described as a city of interns.
Although not a Director’s Intern, Paul A. Leroux ’14 was a recipient of an IOP summer stipend, which provided funding for two internships. He bookended his summer by working for Vermont Health Care for All, an advocacy group for single-payer health care. He researched and attended events and helped plan a forum.
Leroux also worked with the IOP and the Phillips Brooks House Assocation to teach summer civics.
“I got to work with four or five different camps. That was a wonderful experience,” he said. “It was really great to see these kids when they felt a little bit more power.”
For Lee, leaving so quickly meant that her kids at Corazones en Acción only found out about her departure after she’d left. Still, she doesn’t regret the experience “at all.”
Lee just hopes that others will learn from her experience­­—“­In Latin America, don’t play around with dogs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The union that represents the majority of the custodial staff at Harvard has complained to the University that it unfairly changed twenty workers’ hours without consulting the union first.
Under the new schedules, many workers, members of the Service Employees International Union Local 615, are no longer getting paid overtime for working weekends.
But according to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin, the University shifted the schedule of some employees of Facilities Maintenance Operations, the organization in charge of in-house custodial work, in order to save jobs.
“In order to respond to increased operational costs, FMO needed to revisit a policy that essentially provided guaranteed overtime hours on weekends for some workers,” Galvin said. “[The switch] avoided the need to consider the elimination of several full-time positions. FMO leaders were pleased that they were able to find a solution that protected jobs.”
Furthermore, a University official, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the dispute, said that it is not standard practice for FMO to discuss schedule shifts with the union.
“FMO had a long standing practice of discussing schedule changes directly with workers,” the official said.
During the summer, managers within FMO changed the schedules of several Houses, shifting them from a Monday through Friday schedule to either a Tuesday through Saturday schedule or a Sunday through Thursday schedule.
The scheduling change came amidst contract negotiations for over 650 custodians between SEIU and the University. The current contract expires September 23.
Director of Higher Education for SEIU Local 615 Wayne M. Langley criticized not only the manner in which the University implemented the changes, but the schedule adjustments themselves.
“This has had an enormous negative impact in the workforce,” he said.
Affected workers said that the change in hours has had severe, negative financial consequences.
“Sometimes we worked overtime or double overtime so I have money to buy the kids a present,” said one House worker who wished to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the subject. “Now we can’t and there is no overtime during the week.”
Workers described tough consequences at home as a result of working on the weekend.
“I used to have my kids every weekend,” said the House worker, who had his schedule changed to Tuesday through Saturday. “Now I have to work on Saturday; the only day they can come is Sunday.”
Another worker, who also wished to remain anonymous, also said the new schedule is keeping him from his children. “On weekends, we spend time [together],” he said, adding that now he cannot spend time with his children on his days off because they are in school.
SEIU said it was also frustrated with the way the scheduling change was carried out, claiming the union should have been approached before any schedule changes occurred.
“This is not what the contract says,” Langley said. “It has completely disrupted these workers’ lives.”
The University said that managers are open to discussing the schedule changes with the Union and directly with workers.

A Harvard Medical School facility has received five citations from the United States Department of Agriculture, including for the accidental death of a second primate.
The  July 19 inspection report states that the Medical School's facilities in  Boston and Southborough—including the New England Primate Research  Center sponsored by the National Institute of Health—did not meet  necessary conditions set by the department.
 
Paula  S. Gladue, a veterinary medical officer inspector, cited a facility conducting research in a separate facility in Boston for staffing under-qualified surgeons leading to the death of a  non-human primate in February of this year. The report states that the  research staff provided the primate with too high a dose of anesthetics,  causing kidney failure. The animal could not be saved and was  euthanized.
In June 2009, a non-human primate was also found dead in a recently sterilized cage in the NEPRC facility.
“This is the second time in just over a year that the death of a primate at the New England Primate Center has involved negligence,” said Michael A. Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now—an organization that focuses on ending animal abuse in laboratories. “How many animals have to be killed by carelessness before the USDA takes action against this criminal lab?” Budkie added in a press release.
The facility—which has been at the forefront of biomedical primate research since its founding in 1962—was also cited for unsanitary conditions, according to the USDA report. Unsanitary operating room conditions were also noted and included uncovered garbage bins, rusting equipment, and flaking paint near surgical operating tables, violations of the USDA regulations.
In response to the citations, NEPRC took cautionary moves to reestablish compliance with protocol. NEPRC staff researchers are undergoing extra training to avoid any further complications in the use of anesthetics and painkillers.
NEPRC has also altered protocol review processes, halted new research temporarily so that resources could be focused on gathering information to address potential issues, and appointed a subcommittee—consisting of members outside the school—dedicated to reviewing the matter at hand. At this time, the report states, the incidents addressed are considered to be corrected.
“We value the work and dedication of the faculty and staff at the NEPRC, recognizing that countless lifesaving therapies and interventions have been developed through ethical animal research and scores of scientific discoveries have led to improved human health,” NEPRC wrote in a statement.
NEPRC was also being cited for performing procedures on animals toward the end of June without approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. That matter continues to be under investigation to determine corrective actions that should be taken.
“It is clear that the Harvard officials who are responsible for supervising animal research are not doing their jobs,” said Budkie. “How many more primates have died at Harvard due to negligence that we don’t know about?”
Budkie has contacted and filed a complaint with NIH, requesting an investigation and a grant refund from the projects.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: SEP. 2, 2011
The Aug. 31 article incorrectly identified the location of the facilities that had been cited for violations. The primate death cited by investigators occurred at a Boston facility and not one located in Southborough. The story also incorrectly said that the facility was cited for unclean food supplies. Additionally, all research was not halted at the facility; rather, new research was halted after the report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in two years, every student in Life Sciences 1a will be able to see their professor lecture in person.
In past years, students who did not fit into Science Center Hall B, which holds 492 people, watched a live video stream of the class in another hall nearby.
This semester, the introductory life science course, popular among pre-meds, will be offered in two sections for the first time.
“We’ve always been very frustrated with the fact that we’re not able to get all of LS1a into one room,” said Robert A. Lue, who has been teaching LS1a since its inception.
Before moving to the Science Center two years ago, a team of professors taught the course in Sanders Theatre, which seats more than 1,000 people.
“Sanders is so big that we feel very distant from the students,” Lue said. On the other hand, a smaller group of students in Hall A proved difficult to keep “engaged, because they are not seeing us live.”
Lue said he hopes the new structure will help facilitate more frequent demonstration, discussion, and brainstorming opportunities.
To maximize consistency between classes, both sections of the course will be offered on the same day—at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Exams and problem sets will be offered on identical schedules.
The shift will substantially increase the number of hours the class’ four professors will dedicate to the course. Each professor has committed to teaching his or her lectures twice—in addition to attending lectures delivered by the other professors. Lue said he hopes this will help avoid the chance that one section is “better than the other,” and added that a wide range of office hours will still be offered.
Richard M. Losick, who is no longer teaching MCB 52: “Molecular Biology” in order to join LS1a as a fourth professor, said this kind of dedicated team teaching is exactly what he loves so much about LS1a.
“I was horrified to learn that in the past, the class was so large that many students were watching the lectures in a different room. [That] undermines interactive lectures. Why go to Harvard if you can just take all your classes on the internet?” he said.
Many veterans of the class agree that splitting LS1a into two sections is a good idea, although some said they were largely unaffected by the previous format.
“Most of the kids who really wanted to be in the lecture hall made it a point to get there,” said Ariel S. Mitnick ’13. But she added that the dual lecture format has seen success in a few other classes, such as Statistics 104.
After Study Card Day, students are required to attend the section they sign up for, and attendance will be monitored using the clicker-system employed for in-class breakout sessions.
LS1A is officially called “Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A miniscule 1 percent—that was the admissions rate for transfer students last year after Harvard decided to accept just 15 students of the 1486 who applied to transfer to the College.
Thirteen students decided to matriculate and join Harvard’s Classes of 2013 and 2014. They represent the second class of transfer students to be admitted since the College reinstated its transfer admissions program last year.
Christine Gibbons Mascolo, a senior admissions officer and director of transfer admissions, said that while the transfer process may invest a significant amount of resources to admit such a small number of students, admitting transfers is worthwhile for the school.
“Some people say, ‘all of this for 12 students?’” Mascolo said, referring to the 12 students who have chosen to live on campus. “But those are 12 students who have the opportunity to be here.”
Transfer applications sky rocketed this year from 614 applicants in 2010 when the College admitted 13 students for an admissions rate of 2 percent.
Vanderbilt University transfer Wade A. Laycook ’14 said that it was these opportunities that drew him to apply, even though he knew that his chances of getting in were extremely slim.
“Harvard offers more opportunities than my previous school. Everyone here seems motivated,” said Laycook, a prospective government concentrator.
Mark R. Jahnke ’13, who transferred from Boston University, said he sees value in a program that allows students to decide they want to seek out a college that better suits their tastes.
“I never expected to get in,” said Jahnke. “I just wanted to know that I had made an effort to get a more enriching experience.”
Transfer students attended an orientation program designed to get them situated for their time at Harvard. Among the planned events were a welcome dinner, a tour of Widener Library, and a lesson in Harvard jargon.
Jahnke described the program as a “fast version of ‘camp Harvard.’”
“So far the community here has been extremely welcoming,” said Laycook. “Everyone in Lowell has just been amazing in terms of getting me on the right track.”
In what Mascolo describes as a “total coincidence,” three of the admitted students previously attended Vanderbilt. Two lived in the same residential hall.
Laycook said that while he knew both of the other students transferring from Vanderbilt, he was unaware that they had applied to transfer to Harvard.
“We were surprised,” Mascolo said of the coincidence. “We see applications from all over the world.”

As an applied math concentrator at Harvard, Shaan K. Hathiramani '08 never pictured himself in the perfume industry.
He and his brother created their first scent, Ageless, as a Mother's Day present for their Mom, inspiring Hathiramani to leave the finance world and create Harvey Prince, an online perfumery distributing scents that "change the way you feel."
Eau Flirt, a mixture of lavender, pumpkin pie, citrus, and jasmine, is one of the company’s newest products and is marketed as the perfume that "flirts for you."
And based on the customer reaction to their perfume, Hathiramani says the perfume really works.
Hathiramani receives emails "weekly" from customers detailing the "extra looks they get from guys" when out with friends.
"Someone in Greece emailed us recently and said [Eau Flirt] was the perfect bailout," Hathiramani said.
Harvey Prince's other products include Eau de Lite, a scent for dieters hoping to curb cravings, and Ageless, the scent originally created for the brothers’ mother that helps women "smell 8-12 years younger."
"We don't take ourselves too seriously," Hathiramani said. "But we really enjoy creating high quality products that really use high-quality essential ingredients."
Hathiramani said that the company is currently working on a new perfume "specifically for the flirty college girl."
