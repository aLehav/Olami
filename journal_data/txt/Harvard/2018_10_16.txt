After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What to do as we mourn the loss of Harvard time and find our days blighted by the new ungainly gaps between classes? Harvard time was a perfect invention, seven minutes in Harvard heaven; 15 minutes is a horrible, useless interval, too long for ambling through the Yard and too short for real rest. I can only suggest that we fill this awkward idle time with good short reads, of which there are many. As a starting point, here are five fun short stories by Asian-American writers.
1. “My Dear You” by Rachel Khong (Tin House, May 2017)
"I selected fifty-four millimeters for the space between my eyes. All my life, my eyes had been far apart and, growing up, the other kids called me “Hammerhead.” Something nobody tells you is that when you die a death in which your face and body are utterly maimed, you get to choose your face in heaven. Your body, to some extent, as well, because you’re given a body that corresponds to your chosen face. But skin color, nose shape, lips, and teeth—it’s all up to you. That’s the silver lining."
In “My Dear You,” a woman is killed by a crocodile and ends up in heaven, where everyone is hot. If that sounds like a cheesy premise to you, you’re not wrong, but you should still give this story a read. I read “My Dear You” this summer at work and had to hide under my desk so people wouldn’t see me cry—me, the big, irreligious cynic! Khong is an absolutely stunning writer with a gift for humor and an eye for small, strange, poignant details. Read “My Dear You” ASAP and you won’t be disappointed.
2. “A Flawless Silence” by Yiyun Li (The New Yorker, April 2018)
"Sandra said that she had called Chuck a bigot to his face, and he had called her an equally bad name. Min had not called Rich anything denigrating. He had married her because she was not the kind of woman who would use strong words."
“A Flawless Silence” is about a Chinese-American woman whose husband is a Republican and a jerk. Though set in California, the story has a strong New Jersey WeChat energy, which should be recognizable to anyone who has ever gone to a Harvard meetup in New Jersey or spent considerable time among the New Jersey-Harvard WeChat crowd; no other writer has so precisely captured the zeitgeist of this unique demographic. (If you know, you know, and vice versa.)
3. “Mothers, Lock Up Your Daughters Because They Are Terrifying” by Alice Sola Kim (Monstrous Affections: An Anthology of Beastly Tales)
"At midnight we parked by a Staples and tried some seriously dark fucking magic."
In “Mothers, Lock Up Your Daughters Because They Are Terrifying,” a group of Korean-American adoptees casts a spell to be reunited with their respective biological mothers. At once hilarious, disturbing, and tender, this story is sure to resonate with anyone who has ever missed or hated her mother. Fans of science fiction and fantasy writing in particular will be sure to enjoy Alice Sola Kim’s other stories, including “The Next World and the Next” (Lenny Letter, July 2016).
4. “Sweetheart Sorrow” by David Hoon Kim (The New Yorker, June 2007)
"Fumiko had locked herself up before, though she always emerged from her self-confinement after a night or two. There was an expression my father sometimes used, back in Denmark, kæreste sorg—sweetheart sorrow—to describe the sadness one feels at the thought of a love affair nearing its end. A sadness one is not yet ready to face. As I walked away without knocking, I could almost hear my father’s voice in my head."
A Danish graduate student who was adopted from Japan as an infant travels to Paris and helps an eccentric French scientist translate his work. Meanwhile, the student’s girlfriend has been locked in her room for weeks. Kim incorporates multilingualism, physics, and elements of the Gothic into this brilliant cross-cultural narrative. Good stuff.
5. “Puppet Master Made the Puppets” by Vauhini Vara (McSweeney’s Issue 50)
"The morning hurts. Blood on my arms and legs. Brown cream under my fingernails. My blood and skin. Mee rubs coconut oil on my skin. One morning I use my fingernail to scrape the brown from the other nails. I make a little ball with it. Hide it in the bathroom drawer behind the safety pins. The next day I make the ball bigger. I have to roll and roll to make it round. A pearl."
“Puppet Master Made the Puppets” is a wonderfully unsettling story about a little girl and her parents, Mee and Dee. It’s not easy to write from a kid’s perspective, but Vauhini Vara pulls it off perfectly. You’ll have to buy McSweeney’s Issue 50 to read this story, but you should be supporting the arts anyway.
Happy reading!

It was an unusual sale for those at Sotheby's art auction last Friday. Before the event, art collectors rushed around, excited by the energy of Frieze Art Fair in central London. “Girl with a Balloon” wasn’t that different from the rest of the pieces auctioned. This spray painting from Banksy, an anonymous British graffiti artist, sold for $1.4 million dollars. An alarm sounded, and then the painting immediately started to shred itself.
The shredding and the shocked gasps of onlookers quickly went viral. Banksy soon addressed the affair, posting an Instagram video of him installing a shredder into the frame of the work in 2006 with the caption “The urge to destroy is also a creative urge’ —Picasso.” The artist was praised as a provocateur, unafraid to critique the excesses of the art market.
But did Banksy really do anything? Despite the hoopla surrounding the self-destruction of the piece, there doesn’t appear to be any deeper meeting. This was a publicity stunt planned by an artist who has an edgy reputation to maintain.
If Banksy’s urge were to destroy then he must have had very little creativity. Once the whirring stopped, nothing except the painting had changed: The collectors continued to buy art pieces at exorbitant prices, and Banksy remains a popular, well-off, artist. The shredded painting is now worth more money than before. This is a far cry from true destruction projects like John Baldessari’s “Cremation Project” and Michael Landy’s “Break Down,” which featured the destruction of large portions of their artwork and personal belongings. Instead, Banksy capitalizes on his reputation to increase his wealth at no personal cost. As Jonathon Keats writes, “The market for [Banksy’s] work derives from his antagonism toward the market.” If his point were to inspire change in the art community, the shredding of “Girl with a Balloon” at best managed to turn heads for a couple of seconds and get him more publicity.
Banksy’s “art industry criticism” is additionally complicated by the fact that the provocateur may have done it with the consent of the auction house. Although Sotheby’s denies any advanced knowledge about the stunt, many commentators have pointed out that an entire shredder installed into a frame wouldn’t pass routine inspection by the auction house. As the initial surprise wears off, it’s become increasingly apparent that, while a great source of entertainment, Banksy’s publicity stunt leaves no lasting impact on the art world.
The provocateur might have made a better artistic statement had he ended up like one of his copycats, who, after he learned of the rising price of Banksy’s shredded piece, shredded his own £40,000 Banksy work. The print is now worth less than £1, which is an art collector tragedy but mocks our preheld notions about the value of artwork and artistic brilliance — a collector destroying what he loves due to greed. However, the shredding of Banksy’s painting at Sotheby's art auction fails to support any greater meaning other than Banksy’s egotistical and monetary self-worth.
Nevertheless, while Banksy’s work may have been a publicity stunt under the faux appearance of critiquing an industry that he himself depends upon, its reach over social media had tapped into something far greater. The image of the shredded painting has been co-opted as a visual means of political commentary on social media. “Girl with a Balloon” has been replaced with images of maps of Mexico, icebergs, the Constitution, Kavanaugh's reputation, and the Brazilian flag to allude to the process of self-destruction happening around us, and that image is powerful. While the shredding of “Girl with a Balloon” may have not had any effect on the art world, it is giving people more ways to discuss politics. It’s a shame that the motive behind the original appears to be a banal publicity prank.

“Things to Make and Break” is at once about everyone and no one in particular. In her debut collection of 11 short stories, May-Lan Tan seamlessly takes on a different persona in each story, varying in ages and sexualities, narrating in first person the love and loss her characters experience. It’s easy to imagine her characters as anyone — the person across the aisle on the subway, the cashier at the local shop, the odd group of people at the next table in a restaurant. Her personation is fluid, impressively so, describing the desolate relationship of a transgender lesbian woman in one story while convincingly taking on the voice of a college boy in another.
The shining piece of the collection is “Candy Glass”: Nearly 50 pages long and stylized almost like a screenplay, it traces the attraction between Hollywood star Alexa and D.C., her stunning transgender stunt double. Their love — if you can call it that — is tangled. Tan’s usage of the script style takes the story between first person perspectives of both characters, sometimes intercepted with third person point of views, creating a seamless picture of the story effectively reminiscent of a movie.
Asian narratives are integral to this collection. Vivian Chiang narrates “Would Like to Meet,” where she works at a gift shop that sells faux-Japanese dolls, which her roommate Sachiko says that people only have in their house if they’ve lost a baby. Then there’s Lily, a chirpy nine-year-old in Hong Kong whouses her mom’s night out in “Date Night” to learn about her new Indonesian nanny. With characters a little bit older, Tan creates the siblings of a newly married couple — who got married “in front of God and five hundred Korean people — in “101.” Even if they’re not the main characters, Tan adds Asian friends, companions, and their families who are depicted with traditional values and archetypes. Take for example Kumi, girl Lauren’s friend in “Laurens” — a sad story about the parallel lives of two children, one boy and one girl, both named Lauren — with a clean beautiful house and an orthodontist dad, and whose parents are “as calm as people on TV.”
The 11 stories range in mood from whimsical to deeply disturbing to lightheartedly playful, yet the most resounding messages from Tan come out of the dark, melancholy pieces. The ending for both of the Laurens in “Laurens” drips with blood and loss, even though the beginning of the story already seemed dire: “The summer their mothers suicided, the Laurens went to SeaWorld San Diego, where they occupied the same quadrant of the bleachers during the Shamu show, their screams mingling.” Vivian’s date with a married couple in “Would Like to Meet” ends with an unexpectedly morbid twist, added to her own close brush with death just a day before. “Ghosts” is not so ghoulish as it is quiet, with Tan writing about a broken marriage by crafting conversations with empty unsaid feelings, cleverly letting the negative space in the story fill itself. Some of the stories are innocent, and some Tan unabashedly injects with detailed erotica. Tan’s thoughtful dive into varying sexualities and levels of feelings all employ the smallest crumbs of details.
Though Tan’s cover refers to “things” that are made and broken, “things” ranging from moments to relationships to dreams to curtain rings, what ultimately get broken in each story are the people. The brokenness is sometimes so heartbreaking and so tragic that it seems unimaginable. But Tan also brings out the duality of being broken, that people cannot be broken if they weren’t whole in the first place, and that thread of hope is what successfully grounds her stories.

It’s officially October, and while the month ahead promises sweater weather, cider donuts, and spontaneous trips to the apple orchard, there’s more than just fall festivities on the horizon. With the fun and the fuzzy socks come endless, all-encompassing preparation for Halloween. If you’re anything like me — and by “like me,” I mean you weren’t able to watch the movie “Jaws” without covering your eyes until (generously) the age of 16 — each invitation to a horror movie screening is an anxiety-inducing exercise in last-minute-excuse-making. Thankfully for you (and me), these five movies are great for getting in the Halloween spirit without any of the scares!
1. “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown”
This Peanuts take on Halloween is a beloved staple of family cinema. You’ll laugh at Charlie Brown’s futile attempts to kick a football, reminisce about your own trick-or-treating experiences each time Brown says, “I got a rock.” Maybe you’ll even shed a tear when Linus spends his whole night waiting for a “Great Pumpkin” that will never come. What you certainly won’t do is cower in terror at the jump scares of a child-eating sewer clown, à la “It.” What can I say? You really can’t beat the classics.
2. “Beetlejuice”
Featuring stop-motion animation, ’90s-icon Winona Ryder, and Harry Belafonte’s rendition of “The Banana Boat Song,” “Beetlejuice” tells the surprisingly lively tale of a recently-deceased couple’s (Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis) attempts to scare away the new family living in what used to be their house. It’s a great one to watch with the whole family — unless your whole family is watching “The Exorcist” without you in the next room over, in which case a family-sized bag of Halloween candy is just as good a companion!
3. “Hocus Pocus”
Disney’s “Hocus Pocus” is a cult favorite film of the Halloween genre, beloved by fright chasers and dodgers alike. I personally don’t see what’s so great about it. This may or may not be because it gave me recurring nightmares about being kidnapped by witches every October since the first time I watched it. Regardless of my own exaggerated fears, “Hocus Pocus” has just the right amount of humor to offset its spook, and Bette Midler as resident, ring-leading witch Winnie Sanderson is truly a sight to behold. Any list of Halloween movies would be incomplete without an appearance by the bumbling Sanderson sisters and their witchy home of Salem, Massachusetts.
4. “When Harry Met Sally”
If you’re looking for a film that isn’t strictly about Halloween, but still gets you in the spirit of the fall season, look no further than “When Harry Met Sally.” The classic rom-com may not earn a place on most — or any — Halloween lists, but watching Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan fall in love against the backdrop of a New York City autumn will earn it a permanent place in your heart.
5. “The Nightmare Before Christmas”
This Tim Burton masterpiece may be spooky in its animation, but it’s warm and fuzzy at heart. The story of Jack Skellington and his quest to shake things up in Halloween Town (by stealing Christmas, of course) has inspired many a jack-o-lantern and couples costume. While “The Nightmare Before Christmas” doesn’t have any Harry Belafonte tunes, it does have “This is Halloween,” a song guaranteed to stay stuck in your head until at least Christmas. Just in time for you to watch it again!

A massive bomb detonates in a New York apartment building. The FBI rushes to the scene — the fire department is already there, nine minutes after the explosion. All hands are on deck. FBI detective Maggie Bell (Missy Peregrym) commands everyone to evacuate. She seems to suspect something others don’t — and, sure enough, the second bomb goes off, and the entire building explodes.  And thus, the pilot episode of “FBI” starts off with a bang.
CBS’s brand new television series has immense promise. Directed by Emmy-winner Dick Wolf, it gives a dramatic behind-the-scenes peek at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York. The episode begins with FBI special agents Maggie Bell and Omar Adom “OA” Zidan (Zeeko Zaki) arriving at the scene of a recent explosion. These first five minutes are action-packed. While a dramatic pilot episode is a good tactical move, this opening scene is somewhat too exaggerated. The bombed building comes down in a massive, dusty crumble, while the adjacent buildings remain perfectly intact. This portrayal might detract from the credibility of a show about a bureau as serious as the FBI, but it is thrilling nonetheless.
The drama doesn’t stop there. Maggie and OA go back to the office to embark on solving this crime. While spying on a suspect, there is yet another bomb scene outside a store front, at which point the narrative starts to feel like an overwrought action movie. And of course, as in any dramatic crime show, there must be at least one gory murder. An interviewee connected to the crime is found brutally killed. Bombs, gangs, murder: What else does this crime show need? To top it all off, Dallas Roberts gives a very convincing performance as a white supremacist.
“FBI" has all the elements of a quintessential Dick Wolf show. For a start, Maggie is the classic crime show heroine: powerful, a little bit angsty, but sensitive nonetheless. Not only can she force required information out of an interviewee by instilling immense fear, but she is also deeply rattled by the death of a little boy from the building bombing. A good crime show must also pull at the heartstrings, and in this first episode Wolf achieves this through Maggie. Additionally, there is promise of a strong partner dynamic between Maggie and OA, as well as a fierce FBI team supervisor, Dana Mosier, played by Sela Ward. There is some dynamic footage of the FBI office and high tech data analysis, as one might expect.
“FBI” obviously has great drama and suspense. The episode ends exactly as a pilot episode should: The immediate issue is resolved, but the plot has the potential to expand in many directions. Multiple characters have been introduced, and there is now ample room for character development. Overall, there is no question that this premiere is exciting and promises a thrilling season to come. Unfortunately, the show does not prove to be original: It is exactly what you might expect from a Wolf show about the FBI — there isn’t much that distinguishes it from other crime shows like “Law and Order” or even “Criminal Minds.” It has all the usual elements, but not much more. Perhaps it will find its footing in the coming episodes and evolve into a more unique show. But for those who love a classic, predictable crime show, this is the new series for you.

When I told my friends I was writing about a Death Cab For Cutie album, most of them groaned. This response was to be expected. 15 years after the release of their magnum opus, I typically hear opinions of the band ranging from “stale” to “tolerable.” Admittedly, I have yet to hear a complaint I disagree with — the lyrics are unapologetically drenched in cliché; the songs seem tailored toward a certain brand of self-absorbed wallowing; their sound, while distinctive, can become repetitive and formulaic after listening to enough of their songs.
However, it is the simplicity of emotion captured throughout “Transatlanticism” that makes the album so powerful. The single-line refrain “I need you so much closer” is not repeated for more than three minutes over the instrumental build of the title track because frontman Ben Gibbard couldn’t come up with anything else to say; rather, the song works to capture a moment where the need to express that specific longing to transcend distance is so intense, that to fill the space with any other words would be a waste of valuable breath.
Through the form of a concept album, Gibbard manages to paint a multi-dimensional understanding of the interplay of love, distance, and longing while keeping the scope of each individual song narrow and the tone self-absorbed. The spatial and temporal shifts throughout the album lend the songs different meanings in the context of one another. The opening track, “The New Year” couches the album’s examination of love and distance in an examination of nostalgia and what it means to grow older. Through the back-to-back pairing of “Tiny Vessels” and the title track, a sense of distance in intimacy is pitted against the need for intimacy in distance. “We Looked Like Giants” reaches into the narrator’s past, recalling the urgent scramble across distance as he first began exploring his sexuality, a time “when every Thursday I’d brave those mountain passes / and you’d skip your morning classes / and we’d learn how our bodies worked.” Though the past-tense of the song’s title implies that sex no longer carries the larger-than-life awe it held for him in his youth, the other songs on the album show a continuation of this desperate search to find something greater in love and a disillusionment with his failure to do so.
In fact, the only bubble of contentment that is not a product of compromise or resignation is found in “Passenger Seat,” which does what the other songs on the album cannot — it addresses and dismisses the idea of a straining toward a distant goal in the following lines:
“Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
to tell the difference between
shooting stars and satellites
from the passenger seat as
you are driving me home.
Do they collide? I ask
and you smile.
With my feet on the dash,
the world doesn’t matter.”
In an album that devotes so much energy to reaching for another place, person, or time, it is powerful to couch the only instance of such tranquil satisfaction in a song that literally takes place in motion. The song alone is beautiful but trite. But in the context of the album, it is phenomenal.
The album’s songs provide good contrast for one another in terms of sound as well. The words of “Passenger Seat” are sung like a lullaby, paired with calming piano notes, while songs like “The New Year,” “Title and Registration,” and “Death of an Interior Decorator” lend a more upbeat tempo. As the penultimate song of the album, “We Looked Like Giants” carries the most pent-up energy — energy that is then beautifully diffused in the apathetic vocals and soft, steady finger-picking of “A Lack of Color.”
There’s a lot of music I’m quick to dismiss as music I “liked when I was younger,” but this is one exception I will always make: “Transatlanticism” stands the test of time through the way it plays with time itself, weaving together nostalgia for the past and longing for the future. Each song offers a narrow, focused window into one of many veins, to which you bring your own perspective; listening to the album at one point in your life is a different experience than listening to it at any other. For some, the album evokes an anticipatory nostalgia for a time in their life they have yet to reach — a reflection on an alternate present or a possible future. For others, the retrospective perspective Gibbard takes parallels their own. The opening line of the album, “So this is the new year,” illustrates the way in which “Transatlanticism” follows each listener through time. The new year of the opening track could be any year: it is always moving, but the restless feeling expressed throughout the album is constant. In another 15 years, who knows what divides we will be longing to cross?

With midterm elections on the horizon and the increasing political unrest in the country dominating daily headlines, Ike Barinholtz’s film directorial debut, “The Oath” — a dark political satire about family dynamics and political ideologies in a shifting America — hits a little too close to home. The film follows staunchly liberal Chris (Barinholtz) and his wife Kai (Tiffany Haddish) as they attempt to survive Thanksgiving with Chris’s Republican family members after a government loyalty pledge has divided the country.
Though he had directed and produced episodes of “The Mindy Project” before, Barinholtz stepped into new territory with “The Oath,” writing, directing, and starring in the film. Barinholtz praised the newfound freedom while discussing his experience in these new roles.
“If you’re just an actor, you have these filters,” he said. “You have the writer’s words as one filter, and then the director’s vision as his or her filter, and then the same thing with the editor. The appeal of having an idea and being able to present it to people without those filters was very attractive to me.” Barinholtz conjured up the idea for the film directly after the November 2016 elections, citing how important it was throughout the subsequent writing process for the script to stay current with the rapidly changing political events in the country.
“Initially Mason (Billy Magnussen) in my mind was an older guy — he was a guy in his late 50s,” he explained. “And then when I watched the footage on Charlottesville, I wasn’t seeing a lot of oldies, I was seeing a lot of young men. And so immediately the next day I started refashioning the character.” It was both relieving and terrifying, Barinholtz explained, to see the craziness of his script modeled in current events.
It was important to Barinholtz that some comic relief balance out the tone of the film. One such example occurs in the middle of a violent and suspenseful scene when Chris’s dad (Chris Ellis) attempts to turn on the TV and keeps pressing the wrong buttons.
“My dad has never once used the remote correctly,” Barinholtz said, laughing. “That [scene] was pulled from the headlines of my life.” While he strove to treat the problems expressed in the film with the sincerity they deserved, Barinholtz felt it was important to maintain a comedic tone, adding small lines of comedy to the tension in order to maintain a level of humanity.
Though the role he plays is mostly autobiographical, Barinholtz hopes that people don’t become like his character, Chris.
“It is okay to unplug,” he said, asserting it is important not to let fluctuations in the world determine our happiness. “I was basically Chris. A year up to the election, and the year after the election, I was glued to my phone, and I was letting it dictate my mood. I was letting something that Mitch McConnell said affect my mood when I was playing with my daughter. How stupid is that? We’re on this earth for, like, eight seconds, and if we are just so wrapped up and we’re letting it dictate our lives so much, I think you would look at that as a waste of time one day. So I’m hoping people can find the balance that I’m still trying to find.”
“I know so many people who are like, ‘I’m not going to talk to my aunt ever again,’” he added. “I hear a lot of that — ‘I’m done with him.’ I’m not telling people what to do… you have to make those decisions [for yourself]. But I do believe in cycles.”
He went on to describe a world after Donald Trump. “If we have cut all these ties to anyone who challenges us, I think we won’t be able to get those ties back and I don’t know how we move forward,” he said. “I feel like we have an obligation to try at least to keep somewhat tethered to the people that we’re supposed to care about… You meet new friends in your life, but your family is your family.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of a modern age of obsession with Hollywood culture, a timely examination of the American film industry’s origins came in the form of a screening and panel discussion of director Peter L. Brosnan’s “The Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille” at the Harvard Art Museums on Oct. 10.
On the surface, Brosnan’s film appears to simply be a documentary about archaeology, focusing on the unconventional excavation of a movie set — that of legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille’s 1923 blockbuster “The Ten Commandments”: City of the Pharaoh, an artificial ancient Egyptian metropolis. As the movie unfolds, however, it weaves Brosnan’s own story with that of DeMille’s, offering an in-depth look at the parallels between both of their acts of perseverance and defiance. While DeMille was known for commissioning some of the most extravagant movie sets of all time and reaching unprecedented success in cinema despite his studio’s doubts in his abilities, Brosnan also sought to do what was never done before. He wanted to find DeMille’s City of the Pharaoh, although many claimed it had been demolished immediately after the filming of “The Ten Commandments.”
In the panel following the screening, producer Dan J. Coplan, executive producer Francesca Judge Silva, and project archaeologist M. Colleen Hamilton voiced their continued interest in the recovery of DeMille’s city, showing pictures of the archaeology team’s progress in unearthing a third plaster-cast Sphinx from the excavation site in California’s Guadalupe-Nipomo dunes. They explained how DeMille’s city was built by an army of workers using enormous amounts of lumber, then later torn down by cutting the cables anchoring the main buildings and letting them freefall, dynamiting the pharaoh statuary, and burying the plaster-cast Sphinxes in trenches of sand. The panelists soon shifted from discussing their personal interest in the excavation project to why the recovery of Hollywood artifacts should be significant to the general public.
Hamilton spoke about how learning more about the filming of DeMille’s “The Ten Commandments” could inform our understanding of American history. “Keep in mind that there was a group of 2,500 individuals on site for three plus months — those building the set, those acting,” Hamilton said. “One of the things we are still looking for and are working actively to find is the tech, which could be really interesting in terms of learning how these people were living, especially during Prohibition.”
Hamilton’s comment on the crossover between film history and American history echoed the sentiment that director Brosnan expressed in a 2016 interview with Streamline.
“In 1923, Cecil B. DeMille buried enough artifacts in the Guadalupe Dunes to fill several museums. They are a direct link to the earliest days of an American industry that went on to become one of the most powerful cultural forces of the 20th Century,” Brosnan said. “These artifacts need to be saved. Yesterday’s garbage helps us understand who we are now.”
Not only were the artifacts recovered from DeMille’s city important, but so was the public distribution of a film about the excavation. Archaeological discoveries and films about archaeology have a mutually beneficial relationship in which press coverage for one of the two will lead to an increase in general interest in the other. Hamilton also used the example of DeMille’s “The Ten Commandments,” which depicts the religious epic of Moses, set in ancient Egypt.
“At the time when it [‘The Ten Commandments’] was released, it was when the first excavations were going on in Egypt, and that spurred on the audience’s interest — not only in the film, but also in the representation [of archaeology], which was communicating, at a global level, the interest in Egypt,” Hamilton said.
Further, the excavation is also a source of local pride among those living near the Guadalupe-Nipomo dunes. Those whose grandparents witnessed the filming of “The Ten Commandments’” feel that their family history is linked to the movie relics found in the dunes.
“It’s poignant because where the artifacts are right now in the Dunes Center in Guadalupe, California, is thanks to some of the families that you saw [in Brosnan’s documentary],” Silva said. “A couple of the ranchers, their remaining families have donated a larger building so that the Dunes Center can display the bigger pieces that are recovered.”
Despite the significance that the excavation of DeMille’s lost city may have in terms of shedding light on general American history, bringing attention to the field of archaeology, and playing a part in the family history of many Guadalupe locals, Coplan said the leaders of the film industry today are largely indifferent to the project.
“It’s show business, emphasis on business. The reality is that studio heads don’t give a rat’s ass about their history. They’re worried about keeping their profits up so they can keep their perks and their positions of power,” Coplan said. “The ’56 remake of ‘The Ten Commandments’ is played, still, on ABC every year on Passover and Easter, and you would think that they would have an ingrown curiosity about that film and the history of it, but so far I’ve reached deaf ears.”
The creators behind “The Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille” and the documentary itself both assert that Hollywood’s history provides a unique lens to view American history. There are so few films from the 1920s that are still accessible to us today that the remnants of DeMille’s elaborate movie set may be the best chance we have to understand American popular culture of that era. Despite the disinterest of major film studios in the excavation of DeMille’s city, Coplan, Hamilton, and Silva hope to screen “The Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille” in more museums in the future to raise public awareness about the film history that is slipping slowly through their fingers.

“Cada día se nos hace más dificil,” was the last thing I remember my mother saying to me the morning of her disappearance. The garage we called home at the time featured a small futon, a mini refrigerator, and a microwave. In the far-right corner stood a secondhand floor lamp, the space’s only source of lighting, and a large shelf that held most of our belongings. In the other corner were two doors: one that led to a small bathroom and the other into the main house. I was never allowed to open the second — we always entered through a creaky screen door from the backyard. Our weak ceiling fan stood no chance against the debilitating Arizona summer heat. At nights, my mom would sit by the futon and fan my eight-year-old self to sleep.
***
It was three days before Christmas when my mother disappeared. On the radio that morning, the voice of a man discussed something they were calling Proposition 200. Although I had no idea what “proposition” meant, as I watched the reactions of the adults around me, I could tell it meant something bad.
“Nos están matando,” is what my distant tía would say as we watched the news in her living room whenever we came over. Back then, I would pray every night that we would go live with her and leave the stranger’s garage.
***
When I got home from school that afternoon, I did not immediately realize my mother was missing. On most days, my mom finished work at McDonald’s at 5 p.m., and then walked for 45 minutes, rain or shine, from the restaurant to our home. Around 6 p.m. she would arrive after a long day at work and feed me the grilled cheese sandwiches she had made at work. Although it was my favorite meal then, I realize now how much it must have pained her to feed me from the McDonald’s menu.
As I waited for my mom that night, I grabbed dinner from the fridge and fooled around with my Legos on the floor. They had come from a garage sale and were my Christmas present from the previous year. I was not particularly fond of the Legos, but enjoyed the fact I could shape them into almost anything. When no one else was around, I would secretly use them to build dolls. Scanning our garage, I lamented the distinct lack of Christmas decorations — we had always had such a big tree back in our home country. Then, I had the best idea of the first eight years of my life.
Disassembling my dolls, I gathered all of my Legos from the shelf in the corner and began working on a new creation. Although I quickly ran out of green Legos, I filled in the rest with blue, then yellow, and then orange until each Lego and each color had been used. Then, I proudly stood up to examine my masterpiece: a homemade Lego Christmas tree that reached my knees. Satisfied, I pulled myself into bed and watched the screen door patiently, excited for my mom to walk in and see my gift to her. To us.
***
When I woke up the next morning, my mom had still not returned. For a moment, I contemplated calling the police, but then remembered my mom’s warning never to do so. Frustrated, I grabbed a sweater and went to look for her on her route to work. As I walked, I watched as my classmates played in their big front lawns, donning Santa hats and pretending to make snow angels in the grass. I kept my head down so they would not notice me.
After a few minutes, I reached the end of our neighborhood. I stood for a moment, contemplating whether to venture out of the residential area and trying to remember the way to McDonald’s. Unable to do so, I walked dejectedly back to our garage, determined to wait for my mom to return.
***
My mom did not come back home until early Christmas morning. It took me a moment to recognize the figure that quietly crept its way into the garage under the cover of the shadows of the morning and the noise of the music from the clock radio, which I had turned on to feel less alone. As my mom made her way into the light of the lamp in the corner, I recoiled.
“Mami?”
Bruises and cuts stained all of her face and her left eye had been blackened. I knew better than to ask questions. Her eyes lit up slightly as she noticed my homemade Christmas tree in the center of the room. We did not speak any words to one another. As she struggled toward my creation, I made my way toward her. Kneeling, we huddled around the Lego Christmas tree on the floor, holding one another over it as silent tears began to stream from our faces. On the radio, “Feliz Navidad” began to play.
“Feliz navidad.”
I caressed the bruises on her cheek.
“Feliz navidad.”
Her tears become more rapid as they seeped into my collar.
“Feliz navidad.”
I traced the crimson cuts staining the palms of her hand.
“Prospero año y felicidad.”
***
As the song “Feliz Navidad” ended on my phone’s shuffle playlist and another began, I was pulled away from my distant childhood memory and back to the DC red line metro. Removing my headphones, I took a quick glance at the banner on my phone’s lock screen — it read “TWO MISSED CALLS FROM: MOM.” I rested my head on the windowsill once more and watched in envy as a young girl clutched her mother’s hand by the train doors.

It’s safe to say no matter who you are and how bad your dancing skills might be, it’s nearly impossible not to groove out at a Bruno Mars concert. His live performance is electrifying and emotional, and his dance moves are smooth and sexy, making him a brilliant performer. He brought a dance party to TD Garden on Sept. 27 and 28 with his 24K Magic World Tour, and the crowd was on their feet for the entire concert. While his set was simple because he kept it to one main stage, one outfit, very few props, and a some fireworks here and there, Mars doesn’t need the extra fluff of special effects. He’s got his band — The Hooligans — and his stylish dance moves. And that’s more than enough.
After Cardi B dropped out of the tour earlier this year after giving birth to her first daughter, Ciara stepped in. While “I Like It” and “Drip” were admittedly missed, Ciara was a great substitute, and she warmed the crowd up for the first two hours of straight dancing. Ciara’s set included some of her older songs like “Body Party” and “Promise,” but she gave her most energizing performance during her newer singles like “Level Up” and “Dose.”
When the curtain dropped, Mars and his band jumped out wearing colorful Hooligans jerseys and gear and got right into “Finesse.” The crowd exploded in cheers, and Mars seemed surprised that the audience knew the lyrics, as he regularly turned the mic over to let them have their belt-out moment with the chorus.
His performance was not over the top, but that’s how Mars kept his audience engaged. Without the usually flashy sets that come with top hits performers, the focus was on his voice and dancing. The performance could have benefitted, however, from another stage closer to the back of the arena. It felt stuck to the one area after a few songs, and another stage might have made for more crowd interaction.
That being said, his ability to keep the crowd jumping up and down all night with only a few props proves just why Mars can use just his singing and dancing talent to draw in his fans.
Mars’ singing was, as expected, nearly perfect. His voice is smooth but his dance moves, with a plethora of moonwalks and hip thrusts, were even more impressive. Alongside his equally jazzy band, Mars gave off Michael Jackson and Prince vibes, and he did justice to their dance legacies.
Mars didn’t disappoint with the rest of his set as he included all the crowd favorites, like “Treasure” and “24K Magic.” Swaying phone flashlights came out for “When I Was Your Man.” Alone on the stage and shining under a bright spotlight, Mars elicited emotions for the ballad. Tears were shed by a group of older men next to me — that’s how good it was.
In fact, the audience represented a wide range of ages, with everyone from herds of young girls to older couples on date night. Without the extra fluff of most concerts, Mars attracted and entertained a diverse audience.
Mars’ dance party came to a peak, ending with “Locked Out of Heaven,” complete with confetti cannons and more fireworks, but the crowd stayed for an encore of “Uptown Funk” before the curtain closed for the night. When the lights to the arena turned back on, I found myself not wanting to leave, my feet still shuffling and head bopping as “Don’t believe me just watch” kept replaying in my head.
In the final months of his tour that started in March 2017 and ends in November, Mars hasn’t lost his energy. Every minute of his concert proved why he will be a timeless singer of this decade.

A few years in time and a two-hour drive away from the bed I sleep in now is a donut shop getting ready to close. As the hands on the clock inch their way toward 6 p.m. there is an unspoken understanding that this time is not for last-minute customer service, but for preparation. My friend empties the cash registers. I grab the trash bags from the back hallway. She puts out the speaker. I run for the key. When the minute hand hits zero I am already at the door. I hear the opening line of “12 Feet Deep” by The Front Bottoms blast from the speaker before the click of the lock. We stop to serenade the end of another shift together. We repeat this ritual each time we close until, one day, neither of us is there to sing.
All I have left of these days are vignettes of our camaraderie and a sweatshirt that, no matter how many times I wash it, still seems to smell like Sunday mornings spent pouring coffee and commiserating. It didn’t matter if the shop was empty at 5 a.m. or packed at noon — we were in constant conversation and, when it came to the subject, everything was on the table. Frequently, it was music. I can’t prove that the hiring process was intentionally designed to indoctrinate me to the music of Blink 182 and The Story So Far, but every one of my coworkers was obsessed with rock music ranging from indie to pop-punk to screamo. I was hired as an awkward, nerdy 15 year-old who had never been to a concert, let alone a mosh pit, and who listened to soundtracks from Broadway musicals on rotation. That any of these people would put up with me long enough to become my friends was a plot twist rivaling “Wicked’s.”
After a few months of post-work trips to the ice cream shop next door, shared rides home, and shift-long heart-to-hearts, my co-workers and I became inseparable. It was inevitable that some of their music taste would rub off on me. I developed a particular soft spot for the folk-meets-punk-meets-indie band The Front Bottoms, specifically for their EP “Rose,” which comprised much of the playlist of our first summer together. In retrospect, our friendship must have caused a scheduling headache for our boss. One the one hand, we were always willing to work the longest shifts together. On the other, we always wanted the same days off. When we finished work in time, we would pile into whoever’s car was most functional that day and drive to the Granville Gorge, a swimming hole in the foothills of the Berkshires. When I drove, the top down on my 2002 Sebring, the wind should have made it hard to hear the radio. My passengers made sure I never missed a line.
I moved to Cambridge while my friends stayed home to work and attend community college. Soon I found myself watching the adventures I used to be a part of via Snapchat stories in my dorm room. What still brings us together, across the distance and time and work and school schedules, is music. A friend’s tickets to a show at the Sinclair or to Boston Calling are opportunities for milkshakes at Boston Burger Co. and lunch between sets. I learn that many of my former coworkers now work at the same restaurant just 20 minutes from our donut shop and wonder, had I not moved away, if I would be working there too.
Last weekend, closing the restaurant I work in now, I asked my coworkers: “Can I play a song real quick that I used to listen to while working in high school?” They agreed and I attached my phone to the speaker, looked up The Front Bottoms, and put on “12 Feet Deep.” I closed my eyes and I swear, for a second, I could smell powdered sugar.

“If I had words left in me, I would not be here,” reads a line from “Friday Black’s” first piece, “The Finkelstein 5,” capturing the feeling that pulses through each and every story in the collection. “Friday Black,” Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s debut short story collection, is unflinching in its criticism of pervasive elements in modern America, tackling racial injustices, capitalism, school shootings, and more. Yet, even in pressing hot button issues, these stories remain firmly rooted in the people who inhabit them, calling for empathy even, and especially, for the characters who seem to least deserve it.
Several stories are set in a near future that is all too plausible and far too close for comfort. The titular story, “Friday Black,” depicts a Black Friday rush from the perspective of a hard and seasoned retail employee who watches corpses get swept aside casually in a sea of desperate shoppers who turn to rabid and incoherent animals in search of “newly purchased happiness.” In “Zimmer Land” (likely an allusion to George Zimmerman who fatally shot Trayvon Martin), an amusement park sells the opportunity to get “justice” in simulations that include defending a neighborhood against a stranger or stopping a school shooter. Perhaps most horrifying and familiar of all is “The Finkelstein 5,” which depicts a man’s acquittal after decapitating five young black children with a chainsaw in the name of self defense in a world where “if you believe something, anything, then that’s what matters most.” The exaggeration in these scenarios creates visceral discomfort that is only exacerbated when you realize how familiar they seem.
Adjei-Brenyah is far from the first to attempt to tackle the issues plaguing American society through literature, but the ingenuity of his premises works to set this collection apart from the rest. The prose is not particularly lofty, but it features an urgency and concision that presents the fast-paced plot and voice without distraction like in the opening of “Lark Street”: “An impossible hand punched my earlobe. An unborn fetus, aborted the day before, was standing at my bedside.” It is fantastically unexpected ideas like aborted fetuses demanding answers from their father that make the 192 pages flash by.
That is not to say “Friday Black” is an easy read — it is meant to be challenging. Practically every chapter contemplates difficult aspects of humanity, and there is no shortage of gore and visceral depictions of violence. In “The Finkelstein 5” and “Friday Black,” Adjei-Brenyah rides the line between being sharply poignant and on the nose, between literary fiction and straight satire. But considering how truly ridiculous these situations are, and how we as a society come to accept them, this only strengthens his criticism.
The book’s prime accomplishment is in inspiring empathy for the marginalized and the feared. Themes of the black experience are consistently detailed explicitly, from the feeling of being the only black man in the room to maintaining constant consciousness of one’s “Blackness” on a 10-point scale. Yet, Adjei-Brenyah goes further with the standout story “Light Spitter,” which follows the spirits of a school shooter and his victim just after death, expounding on the social isolation so often associated with shootings with minimal cliché. In “Through the Flash,” even a sadist earns a touch of humanity in her eagerness to be better when she confesses to “the worst thing anyone has ever done...to everyone.” Such appeals could be trite in the hands of another author, but Adjei-Brenyah is effective in asking not for forgiveness, but for understanding.
Adjei-Brenyah uses a lens of exaggeration to lay bare harsh truths about our reality and dares his reader not to flinch. “Friday Black” is a strong debut collection that introduces a demanding young voice. Hopefully, for all our sakes, this author has plenty more words left in him to share.

At the beginning of “First Man,” Neil Armstrong has a job interview. It’s not poetic, like the swirling, musical audition in “La La Land,” Damien Chazelle’s 2016 polarizing awards show darling and the most recognizable oeuvre in the Academy wünderkind’s corpus. Nor does it command the militant energy of the disciplinarian teacher’s voyeurism in the opening scene of Chazelle’s 2014 “Whiplash.” It’s not even central to the action of “First Man,” which largely revolves around the terrifying and death-defying space missions that follow. But like the other interviews, it encapsulates the main character’s — in this case, Armstrong’s — work ethic, a demonstrated commitment to his raison d’être. “I don’t think it’ll be exploration just for the sake of exploration,” he explains patiently, of the Gemini 9 mission. “I think it’ll be more the fact that it allows us to see things that maybe we should’ve seen a long time ago.”
Armstrong, like the rest of Chazelle’s characters, is a dreamer. He believes wholeheartedly in the value of this mission, not just as a political pawn in the space race against the Soviets (though that’s undeniably a pressing impetus, both in the film and real life), but as a societal good. Space travel has inhabited the American mythos for the past few generations — Armstrong’s children themselves are already in their 50s and 60s — so it’s unlikely that “First Man” is the first dose of outer space imagery for most moviegoers. Somewhat self-consciously, the biopic, directed by Chazelle and featuring Ryan Gosling in the titular role, doesn’t claim to be an all-encompassing account. Rather, it approaches Armstrong’s story from an intensely human angle, focusing on the emotional cost of the endeavor rather than reveling in the achievements. It also chronicles the trials and tribulations of spaceflight in this era, from governmental roadblocks to domestic conflicts. Rounding out the latter category is familial tension, centered around Neil’s wife, Janet (a dynamic Claire Foy, who proves her chameleonic abilities again and again). It’s a hefty undertaking to make suspenseful film that centers on one of the most well-documented events in modern history, and Chazelle attempts it with aplomb and boyish admiration. Yet there’s something disappointing about its narrow scope, which eclipses other characters in favor of orbiting one man as the film’s gravitational center.
To Chazelle’s credit, “First Man” makes a good faith effort to steer away from the overblown triumphalism of past space travel accounts. (The right-wing controversy about the flag omission proves as much.) Mundane moments, from office drudgery to tedious physics lessons, show that being an astronaut isn’t just the sparkly, glamorous stuff of kindergarten ambitions. This mission is a terrifying endeavor with a body count, and scenes of immense pathos — a private moment of shuttered grief during a funeral, pained recollections of fallen colleagues — attest to the stakes of this enterprise, grounding Armstrong’s triumphs with deeply human tragedy.
These scenes also, however, point to the mores of masculinity that men of the era were expected to espouse: stoicism, strength, and little tolerance for sentimentality. Solitude and quiet brooding are Armstrong’s modus operandi, which Gosling plays accordingly with clenched jaw and clipped terseness. Though this portrayal can distance viewers from Armstrong’s consciousness, it’s certainly factual, as the real-life Armstrong exemplified this brand of masculinity: Janet, who quietly divorced Armstrong in 1994, once said, “Silence is Neil Armstrong’s answer. The word ‘no’ is an argument. He is a very solitary man.”
Poor Janet. It’s easy to imagine those words from an exhausted woman whose emotional and domestic labor held down the fort at home, while Armstrong made a name for himself in space. True, the Armstrongs share tender moments, like the one where they sway in their darkened living room to “Lunar Rhapsody,” a theremin-heavy crooner. But on the whole, Janet’s life is as turbulent as her husband’s career, with the added pressure of being an unwavering constant in an effectively fatherless household. “I wanted a normal life,” Janet says wistfully in the film. “Neil seemed so different from all the boys on campus. He seemed so stable. All I wanted was stability.”
Maybe it’s Foy’s stellar performance or the intensity of this familial turmoil. But the most compelling drama is arguably neither outside of Earth’s atmosphere, nor at mission control, but in the humble, one-story Ohio house where Janet raises the Armstrong boys. It’s too bad that Chazelle leaves this complex drama unplumbed, that it’s merely a device to further Armstrong’s character. The film tacitly suggests his emotional repression is not emblematic of toxic masculinity, but rather a kind of quiet strength. His fatherhood, which is negligent at best and absentee at worst, is simply indicative of a higher calling. Leave the child-rearing to Janet, right? Foy easily ramps up passivity to annoyance, eventually escalating to outright fury. “What are the chances you’re not coming back?” Janet snaps, the night before Neil’s departure. “I don’t want a fucking number. It’s not zero, is it?” Foy’s anger is refreshingly raw, the kind of stripped-down performance that anchors a film — and a man — that desperately wants to take off. Disappointingly, this seems to be a recurring motif for the filmmaker: Janet fits easily into the cadre of Chazelle’s other stifled female characters (“Whiplash”’s Nicole, “La La Land”’s Mia), the ones who are told to step aside, lest they stand in the way of their male partners’ success.
To that end, the film tends to veer toward triumphalism anyway, partially because it’s hard not to portray Armstrong and other men of his ilk in a heroic light. Undeniably, white men are at the helm of this film. They cluster around clunky computers and tensely murmur to each other. They take long walks. They sit in backyards and clink bottles of beer, gazing at stars. While their story is a valid and meaningful one, it’s also historically been the only one, and in an age of increasing representation — even in another film regarding this very historical event — it’s hard to view “First Man” as anything other than regression. The story is already jam-packed, tightly edited, propulsive, and economical, but undeniably, it’s also a little myopic. Janet’s feelings of erasure prove a point: When you only care about the First Man, it seems, there’s no room for anyone else.

Internationally acclaimed Alexandrian author André Aciman drew an eager crowd in Andover Hall for “Exile and Elsewhere,” a discussion that explored the themes of identity and displacement that pervade his writing. Aciman is best known for writing “Call Me By Your Name,” the novel adapted into the Oscar-winning movie about the relationship between Elio, a precocious Italian teenager on the cusp of adulthood, and Oliver, a charismatic Jewish-American grad student who spends a summer with Elio’s family. Lesser known, however, is Aciman’s memoir “Out of Egypt,” in which he chronicles his experiences as an exiled Alexandrian teen and a man without a country.
Aciman was joined by Benjamin Balint, a library fellow at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem who highlighted the connections between wider Jewish narratives of exile, Aciman’s own experiences as a Jew in majority-Muslim Alexandria, and later in life, an exiled Alexandrian abroad. Balint focused the discussion around the complexities of his own national identity and the nostalgia and alienation that haunts his writing. In describing that choice, Balint explained: “I really think that exile runs like a fault line through [Aciman]’s work. That’s why we thought that the theme of ‘Exile and Elsewhere’ would sort of open up some of the larger questions in his work — and it’s both, as I think came out tonight, exile in a very concrete way. That is, exile in this case from Alexandria — but also, less biographically, meditations on the metaphor of exile, and what that means.”
In discussing the connections between exile as a general theme, and narratives of Jewish exile in particular, Balint asked Aciman, “Do you see Jewish exile as an embodiment of a kind of heroic homelessness?” Aciman distanced himself from that tradition, rejecting the idea that there was something intrinsically heroic about exile.
“It’s not a wilful act of displacement — exile, by definition, is something that is forced on you.” It is perhaps this theme of displacement that makes Aciman’s work feel so universal, and allows it to resonate across a diverse and international readership. Aciman’s appeal is two-fold: From his fantastical, romantic way of confronting the past, to the way he so lyrically describes displacement, not only as a separation from something, but also as a source of inspiration, his pull reaches a diverse audience.
“Reading ‘Call Me By Your Name’ in 48 hours as I did, I wanted to put a face to this person who is, as he’s put it, the ‘prince of nostalgia,’” Celia C. Eckert, a student at the Harvard Graduate School for Arts and Sciences, said.
“Aciman’s talks about exile and the way people are in exile is very interesting to me because I am the daughter of Cuban exiles, and that is very important to who I am as a person,” Odalis Garcia, a graduate student at the Harvard Divinity School, said. “I feel like we all, essentially, are part of a diasporic community... to hear someone talk so eloquently about it inspires me to write about it as well.”
Across an audience of many national backgrounds, Aciman’s stories of his own particular nostalgia and longing felt simultaneously universal. “I’m not sad that I don’t have a country,” he put plainly. “I envy people who have that kind of rootedness,” he trailed off, with a laugh, “but I envy them for about five seconds. What protects me from grief is writing about exile.” That poetic dissonance — of richness and loss, wandering and purpose — enables Aciman to portray life and loss with a riveting complexity. Aciman rejected the idea that exile was “triumphant” — but he found in his experiences a creative energy that could imbue the helplessness of exile, for himself and his audience, with meaning and beauty nonetheless.

Me: Freshly minted copper-colored girl of 13 new to the city. That city. Hailed from its armpit, Garden State, paradox of a neighbor.
Them: Subway-riding-since-birth, born and bred Manhattanites, the “Gossip Girl”-esque characters of my nightmares come to life, their doormen plenty, my anxiety palpable, the defense of sharing my former neighborhood with Stephen Colbert nonexistent at this point — it is a few years too soon for us to be watching Comedy Central.
“Livin' on a Prayer” can’t save me from the inevitable — new girl joining middle school right as that horribly awkward chapter is finally nearing its close.
When was your first kiss?
Oh you know, with a boy in Jersey.
What was he like?
Blond…with blue eyes. It was nothing though — what about you?
The first kiss: the imagined kiss.
***
The real first: sweaty, long, against the wall of a party, 15.
Why does anyone do this? What is supposed to be fun about this? His teeth clinking against mine, his wide nose fitting horribly with my long one, spit. Spit everywhere, fusing with the sweat on the wall.
My eyes squeezed shut like I’ve seen them do it in the movies. I imagine them fluttering like moth wings, but that cannot be what mine look like, because I start to see vivid colors behind my eyelids.
I’ve only really spied bits of kisses on TV, in the spaces between my fingers, the fingers shielding my vision in case my mother walks into the living room. The passion evident on those screens feels more alien now than it ever has. I make the mistake of opening my eyes to get a glimpse of his.
Instead, I witness a sea of white faces, shocked that their sober Muslim friend has finally succumbed to culture — that culture — hook-up culture. Ours the only Brown bodies, intermingled, as if by coming together we can form a fortress against the white waves encroaching, as if by merging with each other we can convince ourselves we love that part of ourselves too.
***
The next first: the last one for the next three years.
Ramadan in our native Pakistan on the roof of my aunt’s sprawling home in Gulberg, the lush green of Jam-e-Shirin Park peeking out across the street between the emerald green spikes of the gate, the gate that shelters us from the rest of Lahore.
The sun had set — he’d made sure of that. The moment his cousins knowingly leave us alone on one side of the pillar-like structure on the white roof, he bends his six-foot-one body down to my five-foot-four one and our lips touch. Our tongues weave together in what I think is the sweet embrace of new love, and what becomes evident to me later as the amateur attack of my tongue in his mouth.
But, he is older and more experienced and the kiss does not deter Him. We fall in love that summer as young teenagers do and know how to.
We didn’t know how to.
***
First drunken kiss: first chance dance. He is a Legacy, white, blue-eyed, cultured, a sister at Yale too. The first kiss in three years, the first since Him.
The valve opens: a series of drunken kisses throughout college.
***
The next kiss: an almost kiss — the first date with a Muslim since Him. I get too drunk and end up crying that night. I thank God anyway.
***
The first kiss with a Muslim since Him. He is taller than me too, but younger, so I am less afraid. He is from New York, and this puts me at ease, because the last Muslim was from Pakistan, from the same city as Him, probably went to the same parks and restaurants and weddings as Him, maybe even knows Him.
We are at a party and I semi-initiate. I sit on the edge of a folded-up table leaning against the wall, shrink before him to be even smaller than I already am, allowing him to tower over me.
Our next kiss: We are in his bedroom, and I tell him I can’t sleep with him. I do not tell him that I’ve never had sex because I am Still Afraid. I do not tell this to any of the boys I kiss, catching the occasional wetness in my eyes before they can notice.
***
I wake up naked, almond-brown hair sprawled on one side of the bed, his body facing the wall, our legs entwined. My eyes open to the dappled sunlight slowly overtaking the room, his follow.
Coffee?
Sure, please.
His underwear is bright red. It was highlighter yellow last time. European boys are odd.
I put on my own underwear as he exits the tiny room to the even tinier kitchen. Having no success in locating my shirt, I stand stupidly in my aqua skirt and black bra, begin to clean to have something to do with my hands. It is a sofa bed — I piece it back together.
He emerges, two mugs in hand, a cappuccino for me and an americano for him.
He sits down beside me, a boyish man of 28, an immigrant to this country like I am to mine, but a temporary one, unlike me.
He turns to me, we kiss.
You’re wearing too many clothes.
Laughing, I peel them off again, undoing the work of the last 20 minutes.
It was the last time I saw Rodrigo that summer in Paris. It was the last first kiss I think I’ll ever have: the first sober kiss in seven years. The first sober kiss since Him.
I feel relief.

Written as author Samuel Park was dying of stomach cancer, “The Caregiver” not only ponders the terrifying nature of cancer, but also explores an immigrant’s experience in America and the relationship between mother and daughter. Park’s prose twists the mundane into different forms, shedding new light on themes that are pervasive throughout literature.
The novel begins with Mara working as a caregiver for Kathryn — who suffers from stomach cancer as Park himself did — in Bel Air, California. What at first appears to be a meditation on the trials of cancer patients and their loved ones quickly shifts to a different focus as the reader is transported back to Mara’s childhood, nearly two decades earlier, in Copacabana, Brazil. What follows is a beautiful and twisted look into the love between daughters and mothers, or mother figures.
Park uses metaphors constantly, imbuing his prose with dazzling ingenuity. This employment of language is perhaps striking to an American audience but more common in his native Brazil, as Mara points out: “In America, there were no metaphors. If a woman trusted her partner, she didn’t say that she would set her hand on fire. When a woman had all the power, she didn’t say she had a knife and a piece of cheese in her hands.” Mara lists countless examples of Brazilian idioms and common metaphors, which seem to have influenced Park’s writing. A night isn’t pitch-black, but rather “a vinyl record, dark and full of scratches, in perfect sync with the needle of God.” An experience isn’t mundane, but rather “as exciting and inevitable as Loch Ness for a Highlander.” Each page promises a new metaphor and a new way of experiencing everyday moments.
It is this unique style that so perfectly captures a view of America from the perspective of someone who was raised elsewhere. Mara notices the free things Americans seem to take for granted, such as “the doggie bags at the restaurants. The clothing catalogues. The public bathrooms...The old and the disabled [getting] checks every month from the government.” Restaurants like Subway seem like “mini-factories where the open layout allowed customers to see the assembly line.” Mara notices the differences in social norms between her native Brazil and America, as in America you can’t “knock on [your] neighbor’s door and expect a cup of coffee” but “women were not allowed to be beaten by their husbands and it was okay if they didn’t cook every night.” Most importantly to Mara, “in America, there weren’t ghosts everywhere.”
But Park’s crowning achievement in “The Caregiver” is his ability to depict mother-daughter relationships full of love and tension. Early in the novel, Mara muses on “how silly it was for a mother to make the mistake of falling in love with her own child.” The rest of the novel ruminates on this point, as Mara’s mother is forced to make tough decisions in order to keep her daughter alive during the political strife of Brazil’s authoritarian military dictatorship in the late 1970s. Kathryn, years later, becomes a “proxy mother” with whom Mara can have conversations about life that she never had the chance — or bravery — to have with her own mother in Brazil. It’s as if Park wants us to believe that we should “think of other women as potential mothers...mothers for a moment, for a minute,” but that we should never forget the pain that inevitably accompanies a bond as strong as motherhood.
This novel, written during the darkest of times for Park, is a beacon of light. Although “The Caregiver” deals with difficult topics, the interesting ways in which Park is able to manipulate language creates something altogether beautiful.

“Beautiful Boy” has hard answers for hard questions. Based on the separate memoirs of New York Times contributor David Sheff and his son, Nic Sheff, the film unflinchingly chronicles the cost of addiction on a once-close relationship between father David (Steve Carell) and son Nic (Timothée Chalamet). Viewers watch David’s pride turn to disappointment and impotent rage as Nic tests his family’s love and trust to fuel his methamphetamine habit. Throughout the film, Nic and his father fight raw, emotional battles over the scope of their responsibilities to each other. Is David obliged to give Nic a second, third, or fourth chance that he may not deserve but desperately needs? Does Nic owe it to anyone but himself to sober up? In the end, “Beautiful Boy”  is more horror than Hollywood, and takes no artistic shortcuts to portray addiction honestly: as incurable, unpredictable, corrosive, and dangerous.
Anchoring “Beautiful Boy” are strong performances by Chalamet and Carell. As their relationship is slowly poisoned by Nic’s addiction, Carell masterfully portrays David’s turmoil, deftly transitioning between shock, anger, and numbness. His performance reflects an understanding of David as an essentially flawed human being with grand plans for his son — plans put in jeopardy by Nic’s failings. In a particularly charged scene, a drug-addled Nic and David argue at a diner they frequented in happier times. After Nic asks for money, David expresses his disappointment — that Nic was going to college and would play on the water polo team — and has thrown it all away, saying, “This isn’t you; this isn’t us.” Carell looks convincingly crushed at Nic’s response: “This is me, Dad. This is who I am.” Parallel to the rawness and humanity of Carell’s performance is Chalamet’s Nic: alternately charming and ruthless, ultimately inscrutable and hollow. When Nic comes home late or claims to have a steady job, his occasionally truthful professions of sobriety are always convincing — but never fully.
Carell and Chalamet are supported by a strong ensemble cast. Amy Ryan, who once played Holly Flax on “The Office,” returns opposite Carell as Vicki Sheff, David’s ex-wife. For viewers of “The Office,” Carell and Ryan’s strong, dramatic dynamic may prove jarring — here, the two are divorcés whose tried-and-true response to Nic’s relapses is to bitterly blame each other. Their emotionally charged arguments provide an effective context for exposition. Andre Royo puts in a short but strong performance as Spencer, Nic’s Narcotics Anonymous (NA) sponsor, who understands Nic’s demons but is powerless to stop them. And Maura Tierney plays Karen, David’s current wife and Nic’s stepmother. Karen is more clear-headed about the havoc Nic is wreaking, and more willing to hold him responsible. With Karen as a reference point, David’s unreasonable optimism becomes more and more divorced from reality. Karen ultimately loves Nic, and Tierney brings these emotions to the surface in a poignant scene following a heartbreaking betrayal.
Screenwriters Felix Van Groeningen and Luke Davies have produced a realistic and honest script. The nature of addiction means “Beautiful Boy” cannot follow a traditional story arc; false highs become new lows again and again as Nic relapses. Where a weaker script may have shied away, “Beautiful Boy” confronts harsh realities in exposition. When David visits a doctor to try and understand the damage Nic is doing to himself, there is no relief: A methamphetamine addict’s brain is quickly and permanently altered for the worse, and Nic’s chances of full recovery are slim to none. In short, the eponymous beautiful boy is gone forever. The transformation is hard to watch, but demands one’s full attention.

Lil Wayne announced “Tha Carter V” in 2012 and planned to release it in 2014. The album finally dropped on Sept. 28, just under six years after its genesis. Wayne isn’t to blame for the delay. A series of bizarre events kept the album from the shelves. Cash Money Records delayed the album several times, ostensibly over a feud between Wayne and Birdman, the label’s co-founder. Martin Shkreli almost got the album seized by the US government, and a man with connections to Young Thug and Birdman shot at Lil Wayne’s tour bus. At the apex of the drama, Wayne tweeted “I am a prisoner and so is my creativity.”
Wayne has said that “Tha Carter V” will be his final album. And just as it is the result of a long recording process, “Tha Carter V” is the product of an expansive, storied career. “Tha Carter V” reflects on Lil Wayne’s years of stardom and his years of desperation. At 87 minutes, the album is sprawling, epic, and vulnerable. Lil Wayne’s age shows, and not all the tracks are memorable. But overall, “Tha Carter V” is a striking and uneven conclusion to a striking and uneven career.
For the man who once called himself the “best rapper alive,” “Tha Carter V” is an oddly humble album. On “Don’t Cry (Feat. XXXTENTACION),” Wayne raps “I am not number one, it’s true / I am 9 27 82” — a reference to his birthday and an admission that behind the jewelry, drugs, and private jets, he is a vulnerable person. That this message comes over a dark, bassy beat and with the late XXXTENTACION renders it more poignant. On “Open Letter,” in contrast, Wayne appears solo, on a stripped-down and intimate beat. Rapping over ethereal synths, he delivers what may be the clearest articulation of his theme: “I make it look easy / but understand looks are deceiving.” After years of fame, Wayne is pulling back the curtain and showing us his human side.
Wayne’s vulnerability extends from his career to his childhood — a theme prevalent across much of the “Tha Carter” series. The album cover features Wayne’s mother, Jacinda Carter, and hers is the first and the last voice heard on the project. The album’s final track, “Let It All Work Out,” contains a bombshell: that the self-inflicted gunshot wound Wayne suffered when he was 12 was a suicide attempt. Rapping in an upbeat, energetic flow, Wayne says “I aim where my heart was pounding / I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me.” Wayne’s delivery, combined with the glitzy beat and soothing Sampha sample, strikes an unusual contrast with the track’s dark subject matter. The result is a powerful song and a portrait of a star embracing his troubled past and moving forward.
This humility also appears in the album’s production. On 2013’s “I Am Not a Human Being 2,” Wayne succumbed to trendy production, sacrificing his sound in the process. On “Tha Carter V,” Wayne sticks to the style that made him famous. This sound is not timeless, but it is reliable. “Uproar” was produced by Swizz Beatz, a titan of early-2000s rap. The track is a jock jam straight out of 2008, complete with crowd samples and claps. “Mona Lisa (Feat. Kendrick Lamar)” sounds like “To Pimp a Butterfly”-era Kendrick, which makes sense, since Wayne recorded it in 2014. The retro sound of “Tha Carter V” is an appropriate concession to Wayne’s age. But it does limit the album’s relevance and freshness.
The album’s length also holds it back. “Tha Carter V” is 23 songs long. And for every standout track, there is a dud. “Let it Fly (feat. Travis Scott),” with its processed vocals and dreamy synths, struggles and fails to be a Travis song. “Can’t Be Broken” is the work of a Danish EDM producer. This influence shows: The track’s pitch-shifted vocals sound uninspired and out of place. Similarly forgettable songs fill much of the album’s second half. A major flaw of “Tha Carter V” is that listeners must sit through doldrums of dispensable tracks to reach the album’s emotional highs.
In a way, this is no surprise. With his final album, Lil Wayne sums up his career. It makes sense that “Tha Carter V” is as winding and unpredictable as the career on which it reflects. As a musical product, the album is solid, but not amazing. It has bittersweet ballads and trap bangers, yet it also has bland, generic filler. As a testament to an incredible career, though, “Tha Carter V” shines. Lil Wayne delivers vulnerability and insight into his life and his stardom. Despite its flaws, “Tha Carter V” is an essential album for anyone who wants to know Lil Wayne.

For most early 2000s babies, Outkast evokes an earlier era of rap old enough to never have been one of our collective phases at school but recent enough to make us feel nostalgic. Something about Outkast riles up my friends when the odd song comes on at a party in a way that most ‘90s and 2000s music can’t, be it André 3000’s vibrant rapid-fire vocals or the underlying beats that cannot have been much more conventional during Outkast’s peak than they are now.
Sept. 29th marked the 20-year anniversary of the release of “Aquemini,” the rap duo’s third album, which was certified RIAA Double Platinum and on the Rolling Stone’s list of top 500 albums. Aquemini comes a long way from Outkast’s 1996 sophomore album “ATLiens,” which contains more synthetic, extraterrestrial-inspired background noise and mellow melodies. Like “ATLiens,” it maintains Outkast’s newfound prevalence in the hip hop scene and marks the start of a definitive upward trend and strong spell in Outkast’s discography, paving the path for “Stankonia” and “Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,” which contain the timeless hits “Ms. Jackson,” “The Way You Move,” and “Roses.”
“Aquemini” draws upon a variety of musical traditions and presents them in a form that offers us a zeitgeist of a certain late ‘90s American South, versatile in its appeal to admirers of funk, hip hop, rap, and gospel, from “Old school players to new school fools,” as sung in “Skew It on the Bar-B.” Initially, Outkast was applauded for breaking a glass ceiling for Southern rappers who had been evaluated within the context of the New York rap that had prevailed in the previous couple of decades and that had been credited with establishing and popularizing the genre. Through their encapsulation and legitimization of diverse styles and demolition of the borders that existed around hip hop, Outkast made many traditions adoptable by future artists.
“Aquemini” takes off with a characteristic Outkast minute-long introductory track, with minimal lyrics and mood-setting instrumentals, including light guitar and xylophone, accompanied by “hold on, be strong” sung as an uplifting hymn. It then moves straight into “Return of the ‘G,’” instrumentally slow and heartfelt but with a much heavier beat, a synth background, and a bluesy chorus that layers the words “gangsta” and “return.”
“Aquemini” demonstrates an admirable adroitness in blending lyrics of varying gravity and theme. “Return of the ‘G’” criticizes addiction and crime in the context of parenthood alongside crafty retorts to those who want them to conform to rap clichés or abandon unconventional styles — “[they] say y’all be gospel rappin’/ But they be steady clappin’ when you talk about / Bitches and switches and hoes and clothes and weed.” “West Savannah” tells the story of Big Boi’s upbringing in his grandmother’s care while his young mother worked and of his revered teenage years dealing drugs to “be puttin cable off in every room.” Finally, bare but powerful lyrics speaking to the “fine line between love and hate” come from the chorus of “Liberation,” featuring Cee-Lo Green.
The experimentation with the old and the new in “Aquemini” is bold, whether the slightly distasteful baby talk in the otherwise smooth song “Slump,” the catchy trumpet in “SpottieOttieDopaliscious,” the conversation at the end of the recording of “Rosa Parks,” or the screechy background noise in “Synthesizer.” “Rosa Parks” is a personal favorite — it brings a hollow beat akin to clapping, ‘90s record scratching and turntable sound effects, and layered funk-inspired vocals, in addition to a bridge with a lively harmonica. It creates a high energy unlike anything the Outkast created prior, and that they manage to recreate in hit songs like “B.O.B.” and “Hey Ya!” of “Stankonia” and “Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.” These songs of “Aquemini” not only set a precedent for their later albums, but for the future of rap and hip hop in encouraging similarly inventive and adoptive styles, as well as a new receptiveness to variety and experimentation among music consumers and critics.
In listening and relistening to “Aquemini,” I couldn’t help but draw parallels to specific songs by both modern hip hop artists I listen to now, from Kendrick Lamar to Frank Ocean — it’s clear that these artists are very unlike Outkast, but both have certain aspects that reflect the their style, like the funk elements of “To Pimp a Butterfly” or the editing of Frank Ocean’s instrumentals in certain songs on “channel ORANGE.” Unlike Michael Jackson or David Bowie, Outkast may never be named one of the most influential artists of a century, but the duo has a quieter legacy, such as the new convention of unconventionality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is considering changing to an early registration system starting as early as spring of 2020, moving away from the current "shopping week," a period at the start of each semester during which students can sit in on courses before enrolling. It’s about time. While shopping week may allow undergraduates to obtain slightly more information about courses, it is simply not worth the costs borne largely by graduate student teaching fellows.
Every semester, graduate student TFs face problems caused by shopping week. Because there is no way to determine the final student enrollment for courses, it is impossible to accurately predict where TFs need to be assigned. In my department, this has resulted in at least one TF needing to be moved after shopping week in every semester I’ve been at Harvard. In my first semester teaching, this happened to me, where after spending weeks preparing for one course — meeting with the professor and other TFs, preparing readings, planning sections, and doing other administrative tasks — I was forced to move to a new course with only two days to prepare for my first section. Not only was this a problem for me, but my students also had to deal with the change.
Additionally, the lack of ability to plan can lead to more serious labor issues. Some TFs that aren’t guaranteed teaching can lose their funding if their assigned course ends up under-enrolled. In another example from my department, a TF agreed to take on a section of another course — along with a corresponding pay increase — in addition to two sections of her assigned course. But when her first assigned course was under-enrolled, one of her two sections was removed along with her pay increase, leaving her teaching two sections of two different courses, while being paid the same rate as any other TF.
There are also downsides for professors. When one course I was assigned to ended up over-enrolled, our department had to find two additional TFs and a new classroom that could accommodate the class size in less than a week. The professor, meanwhile, had to alter her course to reflect the change from 40 to over 100 students, while working with the new TFs and a less-than-ideal classroom. Professors also cannot expect students to complete work — or at times even show up — during shopping week, making planning difficult.
Students are also adversely affected by shopping week. Lotteries for courses often don’t occur until the end of shopping week, and sections often cannot be planned until two or even three weeks into the semester. This makes it difficult for undergraduates to plan their schedules, especially for those who have jobs or are engaged in extracurricular activities.
All of these problems are completely avoidable with an early registration system, something that many other universities in the United States have. Here is how the system works, for example, at my alma mater, the University of Virginia. The course catalog for the upcoming Fall semester is released in March, allowing students ample time to search for courses and read posted course syllabi and course reviews. Registration begins in April, with more senior students signing up earlier, while incoming first year students sign up during a mandatory meeting with an advisor during their orientation (and some space in certain courses popular among first years is reserved).
Nobody is locked into place, however, as students are still allowed some flexibility to change courses during an add/drop period in the first two weeks of the semester. The difference is that the burden is on the student, where in order to change courses, the new course must have space and must fit their schedule. Students are also responsible for any material and assignments missed due to joining a course late. Data from other universities, meanwhile, shows that while there is plenty of student movement in the add/drop period, the overall numbers for most courses do not deviate significantly from the early registration period.
During the period between early registration and the start of the semester, however, necessary adjustments can be made. If a course is over-enrolled, there is time either to set up a waitlist or lottery, or to find a larger classroom to accommodate more students. Whether a class is under- or over-enrolled, professors have time to adjust the design of their courses, and TFs can be properly assigned.
There are too many benefits to be gained from early registration to offset a very small cost. The uncertainty that comes with the shopping week — particularly for graduate students — is simply not worth keeping this unique Harvard feature. It’s time for shopping week to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve spent countless conversations defending abstract art — paintings like a red line slashed over a blank white background, or shapeless layered scribbles and splatters, or multicolored boxes suspended across a canvas. The kind of art that makes people scoff and conclude that “any child could have made it.” The kind of art that I, too, used to consider boring, pointless, and overly simplistic.
But my mindset began to shift in a painting class at Harvard last year. Sitting through lectures showed me how to truly contemplate paintings that I would have dismissed in seconds on my own. And when assignments demanded that I make the kind of art that I didn’t like or understand, I realized that an incredibly time-consuming and complex process goes into creating simple-looking paintings.
Because simplicity forces artists to whittle their art down to its barest, most basic elements. And it forces viewers to work hard for comprehension. Unlike photorealistic art, for example, nobody can look at an abstract painting and instantly understand it. Each detail matters, but its significance is elusive. There’s no “right” reason to explain why a certain shape’s mismatched edges don’t form a perfect square, why a particular combination of colors is oddly jarring, or why a specific line travels along jagged angles, rather than through smoothly meandering curves.
It’s easy to answer these questions by deeming the artwork aimless and arbitrary, something “any child could have made.” But it’s much more interesting to view these works as interpretive puzzles, exercises for the imagination, inviting artists and viewers to somehow make sense of what they’re seeing. We can transform abstract art into a streamlined version of reality, a representation of actual images and events, or even a simple narrative about balanced, bizarre, or surprising relationships between shapes, colors, and lines.
And humans are built to generate meaning out of simpler things. We stare at the clouds to construct shapes, pictures, animals, and people from drifting water vapor. We connect random clusters of stars into constellations that tell stories. We can’t help but see faces in inanimate objects everywhere — trees, wall sockets, car bumpers, or Jesus famously burnt into toast. And we can translate extraordinarily minimalist symbols like “:)” or “:(” or “:/” into complex emotional perceptions.
Yet so many people seem to be averse to simplicity. This aversion manifests itself in negative responses to abstract art (my own initial response included). But it also manifests in so many other areas — like the joke about a physics problem that “assumes a spherical cow in a frictionless vacuum,” which critiques oversimplification in scientific and mathematical modeling. The real world is impossibly complicated, so simplicity can be seen as a failure, something detached from reality, unable to tell us anything practical or useful. And this same aversion is manifested in our everyday lives.
At Harvard, people tend to complicate rather than simplify. There are always more meetings, lunches, lectures, clubs, comps, shows, or practices to squeeze into our calendars. And our jam-packed academic, extracurricular, and social lives are often scheduled down to the minute. We’re more enthusiastic to take on responsibilities than to drop them. And I think that sometimes we forget to ask ourselves why.
Valuing simplicity doesn’t mean that we should indiscriminately slash our schedules, cut down our activities, or seek to accomplish the bare minimum. It just means that we should take the time to contemplate everything we’re doing in broad strokes, with the same meditative energy that allows us to look at an abstract painting and find a bridge between its complexity and simplicity. The day-to-day workings of our lives can and will be complicated and difficult, but our overarching goals and values tend to be much clearer. And it’s important to make sure that these two facets align with each other. We often feel like we have to take certain classes, join certain groups, pursue certain leadership positions, aim for certain jobs — but there’s no point to doing so if they won’t bring us happiness, won’t reward and fulfill our values, won’t actually help us realize our dreams. It’s okay to simplify our lives when simplification ultimately preserves these core underlying goals.
Simplicity and complexity are two sides of the same coin. They teach us the most when we join them together: Abstract art and reality, spherical cows and living ones, our broader aspirations and the countless daily steps we take to get there. Without complicating interpretations, abstract art remains dismissible, boring, arbitrary — in the same way that, without concrete actions to achieve them, our aspirations remain abstract and unattainable. And we must always stay faithful to these broader aspirations to the simplest reasons why we wake up every morning and make it through the daily grind, in order to give it greater meaning.

Although the 2016 Harvard-Yale football game was a tragic letdown (the Crimson fell to the Bulldogs 21 to 14), Harvard prevailed over our New Haven neighbor by a razor thin margin in something arguably more important that year: the rate at which undergraduate students voted. In 2016, 57.8 percent of Harvard students voted in the presidential election, compared to 56.7 percent of students at Yale. Those numbers might seem surprisingly low, but according to a survey by the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement, the average rate of voting in 2014 among participating institutions of higher education was just 18.8 percent. Yet while Yale might claim to be part of the voter-turnout elite, Harvard still managed to #BeatYale.
In order to increase voter turnout for the significant upcoming elections, organizers have coordinated to launch the Harvard-Yale Votes Challenges, a competition to see which school could garner a higher number of pledges to vote. We are in full support of this idea — any match in which we can prove Harvard’s objective superiority is a match we’d like to see. In a year when many students fear that the relocated Harvard-Yale football game will be a dud, we wholeheartedly welcome another creative outlet to rally our school spirit, crush Yale, and (perhaps) even more importantly, get out the vote.
Voting is a vital civic duty. It is especially important for young people, who are notoriously absent at the polls, to participate. Less than half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 30 voted in the 2016 election, while over 70 percent of seniors did. In a year when there are a great number of key political seats at play, students should have no shortage of opportunities to have their voices heard. It is for this reason that we find it especially regrettable that Yale students, who reside in a more electorally competitive state than Harvard students, have voted at a lower rate than us in the past.
Today marks three weeks until Election Day, and 33 days until Harvard-Yale. While the outcome of The Game remains unknown, it is still well within our power as a student body to fulfill our civic duty and vote — and to fulfill our duty to Harvard by voting more than Yalies do. After all, nothing is scarier than the thought of Yale students choosing our future leaders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whole Heart Provisions opened in the Smith Campus Center Sunday, boasting a colorful vegetarian and vegan menu of mixed vegetable bowls as well as snacks like shishito peppers, seared avocado, and brussel sprouts.
The Harvard Square branch is the plant-based restaurant chain’s third location. Co-founders Rebecca Arnold and James V. DiSabatino said they hope the location will become an integrated part of Harvard. The duo handed out free t-shirts to the first 20 customers, reading “Eat Kale Beet Yale.”
In September 2015, Whole Heart Provisions opened its first location in Allston, followed by one in Central Square this past spring. Around the same time, according to DiSabatino, Harvard approached the co-founders about a location in the Smith Center.
“At first, we didn’t know if we wanted to open two new locations in the same year,” DiSabatino said. After the initial hesitation, it was the Smith Campus Center setting that persuaded them. “As soon as they showed us pictures of what this building was going to be, we kind of said ‘Yeah, I think we need to be part of it.’”
Whole Heart’s Communications Director, Meghan S. Goodwin ’15, who is also the head coach of the Harvard Cheer team, said the restaurant’s business model emphasizes healthy eating above all.
“First and foremost we want to create delicious food that people crave. That’s our number one goal. I guess, the second tier of our mission is ‘It’s good for your body.’ We always say ‘You can eat Whole Heart seven days a week. You’re never going to go into a food coma,’” Goodwin said.
DiSabatino added that he sees a meat-free diet as a forward-looking move.
“I think it’s just looking at the future. A hundred years from now are we going to be eating less meat or more meat as a society? I think it’s pretty clear it’s going to be less, because the planet kind of depends on it,” DiSabatino said.
Customers eagerly flocked to the Smitch Center when Whole Heart opened for business Sunday morning.
Steven Wang, who said he is a regular at Whole Heart’s Central Square location, grabbed sesame shishitos—and a free “Eat Kale Beet Yale” shirt—at the opening.
“Definitely going to be repping the shirt a lot. It’s gonna be pretty dope,” Wang said.
Jacqueline F. Tubbs ’22, who is working towards being vegetarian, said the restaurant would make her transition easier because it’s centrally located and healthy. “It’s for us, for people who aren’t eating meat as much. So it’s cool,” Tubbs said.
Whole Heart Provisions is the final restaurant to open in the Smith Campus Center, which itself opened to fanfare last month after more than two years of renovations. The campus center now boasts seven restaurants on its ground floor.
“We really like to immerse ourselves in the community,” Goodwin said. “We’re kind of psyched, even just by our location, to already be knee-deep in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Earth and Planetary Sciences department has a new rising star.
Earth and Planetary Sciences 10: “A Brief History of the Earth” — an introductory course taught by EPS professor Jerry X. Mitrovica — has almost doubled its enrollment numbers every semester it has been offered, according to data released by the registrar’s office. The course has been taught three times since its inception in Spring 2017.
The course, currently comprised of 59 undergraduates, offers EPS concentrators and non-concentrators alike a glimpse into important processes in the history of the Earth — from the emergence of oxygen in Earth’s early atmosphere to the contemporary challenges of rising sea levels caused by global warming.
According to Mitrovica, EPS 10 allows students to explore the historical trends behind recent natural events such as Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida last week — and actively participate in conversations about these incidents.
“The typical discussion that happens after a hurricane is ‘Are these hurricanes happening at higher frequencies?’” he said. “We want our students to be able to, even if they can’t speak to that with expertise, understand the discussion that goes around them.”
He added that earth science courses like EPS 10 try to avoid the technical jargon found in academic settings that Mitrovica said can serve as an “obstacle to learning.”
“The language of earth science is the language of the general public — certainly, Harvard undergraduates,” he said. “I think it’s an attraction for them in that it gives them a really good first course that covers the whole range [of Earth’s history].”
Several students said they were enjoying the course, with some ranking it as their favorite course of their semester.
“Jerry Mitrovica is a meme of a man, he’s an absolute riot,” said Sophie C. Webster ’21, a student in the class. “Going to his lectures is like going to an hour of vaguely stand-up comedy.”
“There’s this stereotype around geoscience that it’s very boring and very dull — rocky as it were — but he does a really good job of delivering it with so much verve and enthusiasm,” she added.
Mitrovica said he and the course teaching fellows have made enhancing students’ experiences in EPS 10 their “priority.” To this end, they plan to offer students opportunities to extend their learning beyond the classroom — for example, by exploring the origins of pigments at the Harvard Art Museums and walking through a tectonic fault in EPS Department Chair John H. Shaw’s virtual reality lab.
Mitrovica said one of the lesser-appreciated legacies of a successful course is the sense of “community” it fosters. This is something he and the teaching staff of EPS 10 have striven to promote through class excursions and lighthearted discussions.
Kendra N. Wilkinson ’21, another student in the class, said she thinks Mitrovica’s teaching is effective because he encourages his students to genuinely enjoy the material.
“Rather than making it a super hard class, he makes it very fun, but you learn just as much as you would otherwise,” Wilkinson said.
Mitrovica said the course’s growing size has presented some logistical challenges in terms of maximizing student interaction. To accommodate the influx of students, the course was relocated from a smaller room, where students gathered around a U-shaped table, to a less intimate lecture hall.
Still, Mitrovica said he likes the direction the course is going this semester.
“We have lots of lighthearted times in the class, which I cherish and I think they do too,” he said.
“Hopefully [my stories] are relevant, but, to be honest, many of them aren’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Loomis-Michael Observatory Telescope — located on the tenth floor of Harvard’s Science Center — is undergoing a series of improvements that student astronomers say will renew and revitalize its role on campus.
The improvements include a thorough cleaning of the lenses and a mechanical repair of the hand paddle, which allows for fine control of the telescope’s movement. The astronomy department has also authorized improvements to the observatory’s dome and the telescope’s pier, which is used to support the telescope. The changes are minor, but long overdue, according to Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe President Rodrigo E. Cordova ’19.
Prior to the improvements, observers could see the dust on the end of the telescope when looking through it. The hand paddle, meanwhile, had been broken for most of STAHR’s institutional memory, according to Cordova.
Cordova laughed when recalling having to manually adjust the instrument in past years.
“I remember teaching a class and having to say, ‘If it’s almost in the center but not quite there… just pat it,’” Cordova said.
Cordova added that the telescope’s recovered capacity for fine, mechanized adjustment will allow the club to pursue its burgeoning interest in astrophotography.
Funding for the repairs comes out of the Science Center’s facilities budget. Some repairs, like the fixes made to the hand paddle, have already been completed. The upcoming repairs will not interfere with student use of the telescope, Cordova said.
The telescope’s history at Harvard extends all the way back to 1976. Yellowing logbooks, stuffed rather haphazardly into the drawers of a filing cabinet, are witnesses to this decades-long history.
Students who took the time to look through the logbooks have occasionally stumbled across a familiar name.
“Couldn’t sleep,” begins one 1:45 a.m. entry by Neil deGrasse Tyson ’80.
The telescope itself is old, but its design is even older, predating Isaac Newton’s modern reflecting telescope. According to Cordova, “this is the older type of [refracting] telescope, the kind that that Galileo, for instance...pointed at the sky.”
Since the telescope is outdated, the Loomis-Michael Observatory is not used for classes or research, but is primarily meant for recreational use. Students who complete a telescope training course run by STAHR receive swipe access to the observatory.
Though the telescope is not technically impressive, even compared to the smaller, portable telescopes owned by STAHR, Cordova said there’s something special about “actually learning how to run an observatory, and how to spin the dome, and how to move a telescope up and down.”
Demand for the telescope course is high — while STAHR can train around 60 students per semester, over 200 apply each time the club releases applications for the class.
Astronomy Professor Jonathan “Josh” E. Grindlay, who used the Loomis Michael Observatory telescope during his graduate studies at Harvard, said he found the telescope to be a great opportunity for undergraduates, who can “look at lots of things visually and learn a lot from what [they’re] doing. And it’s beautiful.”
Cordova said he hoped the telescope will last for generations to come, assuming that “everybody keeps taking care of it the way we have and it keeps getting passed down to interested people.”
New STAHR club member Andrew Wang ’22 said he looked forward to using the telescope to unwind during his time on campus.
“Astronomy gives you perspective on how small...our problems here on Earth are,” Wang said. “Sometimes you need to take a step back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five years of organizing, two elections, three legal appeals, and more than a few rallies, members of Harvard’s graduate student union entered their first bargaining session with Harvard administrators Monday afternoon.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers marked the occasion with a kickoff rally in Harvard Yard. Mid-day Monday, around 40 union members gathered under overcast skies to celebrate a day that, as recently as last semester, many believed would never come.
The makeup of the crowd reflected just how long graduate students have been pushing to make these negotiations a reality — almost no one present was among the first group of HGSU-UAW organizers that formed five years ago. Some were not even students at Harvard when eligible graduate and undergraduate students first voted on whether to form a union in Nov. 2016.
If the union succeeds in advocating for major reforms, the negotiations could radically change the student experience of HGSU-UAW’s roughly 5,000 members. At the rally, attendees were asked to shout out what they hope the first contract will produce. Among their asks: “fair pay,” “vision and dental,” “accountability against abuse,” “protect international workers,” and “childcare support.”
In agreeing to bargain in good faith with the union, Harvard joins a small handful of private universities — including Brandeis University, Tufts University, New York University, the New School, and American University — that have entered formal contract negotiations with their students. Of these cases, HGSU-UAW’s negotiations are of an unprecedented scale — at around 5,000 members, HGSU-UAW’s bargaining unit is about five times the size of other student unions’.
The union’s sheer numbers could complicate negotiations — and the makeup and complexity of the bargaining unit, which is comprised of undergraduate and graduate teaching and research assistants, may also prove thorny. As they work towards a contract, HSGU-UAW and administrators will have to navigate the financial status, harassment policies, and administrative priorities of Harvard’s 12 schools — all of which may not necessarily align.
HGSU-UAW’s bargaining committee spent much of the summer and fall surveying its constituents and developing an 80-count list of preliminary bargaining goals, which the union released in early September. Experts called the list, which spanned topics from childcare to anti-discrimination protections, “very ambitious,” a charge several speakers refuted at Monday’s event.
HGSU-UAW Civil and Human Rights Committee member Felix Y. Owusu said his prior experience as a member of another graduate student union — the UC Student-Workers Union at the University of California, Berkeley — leads him to believe that HSGU-UAW can negotiate a contract that touches every aspect of members’ Harvard experience.
“Ignoring the fact that this is negotiations — we don’t want to compromise preemptively — some of the things that people talked about that seems like they were pie-in-the-sky, kind of ‘reach’ things, are not,” he said. “A lot of the things that we’re saying that we could never do or we couldn’t afford here at Harvard University, with an endowment the size of the GDP of some nations, are things that other universities already have in their unions’ contracts.”
Despite the gravity of their asks, the pre-bargaining event also included lighter moments. Students drank “solidarity cider,” sang or spoke chants, and rerouted confused tourists and students rushing to class.
Bargaining committee member and Ph.D. student Justin Bloesch said sharing food is one way the union has built community among graduate students. He added he thinks the push for a union has helped graduate students feel less alone.
“When you have a union, you’re not just an individual navigating the system anymore,” Bloesch said. “Have a drink together, meet with your department, chat about what’s going on in your life. In the end, the contract means nothing if you don’t read it and talk about it.”
Just before 12:30 p.m., bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16 — a former Crimson magazine editor — said her team would be late if they didn’t leave the Yard soon. Soon after, the entire crowd began shepherding the 13-member bargaining team towards their meeting with the University, held in the Office for Labor and Employee Relations at 124 Mount Auburn Street.
Representatives from HGSU-UAW declined to comment on how the half-day session went. In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain emphasized the unique circumstances under which the negotiations are taking place.
“We were pleased to begin negotiations today with our newest union partners as we begin the process of creating, from scratch, the first-ever contract of its kind here at Harvard,” he wrote. “We remain focused on engaging in productive, thoughtful discussions that will move the negotiations forward and result in a superior contract for both parties, upholding Harvard’s commitment to excellence for all students.”

After years of lawsuits, investigations, and controversy surrounding research malpractice, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital requested retractions Sunday for 31 papers written by a former faculty member.
The professor, Dr. Piero Anversa, held a joint appointment between the Medical School and Brigham and Women’s. He left the Medical School in December 2015, school spokesperson Gina Vild wrote in an email. The research conducted in Anversa’s laboratory primarily concerned cardiac stem cells.
“Following a review of research conducted in the former lab of Piero Anversa, we determined that 31 publications included falsified and/or fabricated data, and we have notified all relevant journals,” a joint statement from Harvard and Brigham and Women’s reads.
Anversa could not be reached for comment for this story.
The institutions also underscored the importance of ethical research practices.
“A bedrock principle of science is that all publications are supported by rigorous research practices,” the statement reads. “The scientific community is interdependent and reliant on the rigor and good faith of researchers as we work collaboratively to advance knowledge and transform human health.”
The statement did not name the journals from which they had requested retractions.
These retraction requests are not the first time Anversa’s research has come under scrutiny. In 2014, both institutions launched an investigation into his findings, prompting the journal Circulation to retract one of his papers and The Lancet to publish an “expression of concern” about another.
Anversa and one of his co-authors subsequently sued Harvard and Brigham and Women’s in response, alleging that their investigations were illegal and harming the researchers’ reputations. In an August 2016 decision, the University and the hospital won the lawsuit.
After leaving Harvard and Brigham and Women’s in December 2015, Anversa went to work at Cardiocentro Ticino, a Swiss institute affiliated with the University of Zurich.
April Rusconi, assistant director at Cardiocentro Ticino, wrote in an email that Anversa no longer works there.
Last April, Brigham and Women’s and its parent company, Partners Healthcare, paid a $10 million settlement to the federal government for alleged research fraud Anversa committed in obtaining tens of millions of dollars in funds from the National Institutes of Health.
A press release from the Department of Justice stated at the time that Anversa and his colleagues had violated several research norms.
“The government alleges that problems with the work of the laboratory included improper protocols, invalid and inaccurately characterized cardiac stem cells, reckless or deliberately misleading record-keeping, and discrepancies and/or fabrication of data and images included in applications and publications,” the press release stated.

Harvard University Health Services, with the help of undergraduates, is gearing up to prevent a flu epidemic on campus this winter, holding vaccination clinics and encouraging people to get their flu shot.
Earlier this month, HUHS started hosting vaccination clinics, offering free flu shots to all University affiliates. Harvard students, faculty, and staff can walk over to HUHS in the Smith Campus Center to receive their shots, and HUHS is also running mobile clinics out of the Law School, Business School, Medical School, and undergraduate dining halls.
HealthPALS member Margaret “Maggie” E. Reynolds ’20 said the student organization assists HUHS in coordinating these clinics for College students.
“All they have to do is fill out a form, they get in line, the nurse gives them their flu shot, and then they get a little ‘I got my flu shot’ sticker at the end of it,” Reynolds said.
Riley E. Hoveland ’22 said she appreciated the convenience of the clinics.
“It takes literally three seconds and it doesn’t hurt, so why wouldn’t you get one?” she said.
Donna V. Campbell, the infection control surveillance officer for HUHS, said the flu clinics aim to immunize a large percentage of Harvard affiliates by making vaccinations convenient and accessible.
“We’re aiming for herd immunity,” Campbell explained. Herd immunity is an epidemiological term that describes a situation where a large percentage of a population is immunized from an infectious disease thus also protecting individuals who are not immune from the disease.
“You’re getting a flu shot, but you’re basically trying to protect other people who can’t,” she added.
In addition to the flu clinics happening throughout the week, Reynolds also encouraged people to take simple preventative measures to limit the spread of the flu. Reynolds said it’s “all the silly things we’ve learned since we were five” — washing hands, covering coughs, and being aware of the people around you.
Campbell agreed, saying these preventative measures, in addition to the vaccine, are essential for limiting the virus’s spread. The Center for Disease Control found that last year’s vaccine was only about 40 percent effective; most experts estimate that the vaccine takes two weeks to be fully effective.
William P. Hanage, a epidemiology professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said part of this problem arises from the way the vaccines are created.
“Flu is a moving target,” Hanage said. “We have to make a very educated guess, or as educated as you possibly can be, as to what’s going to be a problem down the line.”
This year, Hanage said the flu seems to be derived from the H1N1 strain, the same one that caused the 2009 swine flu pandemic. He warned about the unpredictability of the flu, especially this early in the season. But from observing the flu season so far in Australia, he said this year’s flu seems moderate.
Nevertheless, Campbell said the unique nature of a college campus environment affects community efforts to prevent the spread of the flu.
Campbell said college students might be particularly prone to infection: “Any kind of communal living situation is kind of a hotbed for anything that’s infectious.”
On the other hand, Reynolds said the close-knit environment of a college campus can also have advantages for flu prevention. She said people often go with their friends to get shots, or are prompted by seeing the “I got my flu shot” stickers.
Campbell said HUHS encourages people to get their shot soon. She added that most cases of the flu are observed after Thanksgiving because affiliates leave campus and often return with diseases from other environments. She said the most important thing to prevent a flu epidemic on campus is for everyone to be vaccinated.
“Everybody should have a flu shot. Everybody," she said.
Hanage agreed. “If you’re offered a vaccine, take it," he said.

On Sunday Oct. 14, 2018, Harvard split into two parallel universes.
Around 11 a.m., hundreds of students, alumni, and locals began massing in Harvard Square to show their support for the College’s race-conscious admissions policies. Rally-goers lofted signs reading “#DefendDiversity,” sang along to “Ain’t No Mountain high Enough,” and donned blue T-shirts decorated with University seals and the motto “Diversitas.”
One hour later and four miles away across the Charles River, hundreds more students, alumni, and locals gathered in Copley Square to affirm their belief that Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Demonstrators plastered themselves with stickers and hoisted posters asking Harvard to stop using “Asian quota[s]” to show support for Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group that sued the University in 2014 over allegations its admissions process is racially discriminatory.
The dueling rallies took place one day before SFFA’s four-year-old lawsuit went to trial in Boston in a highly anticipated showdown that will likely shape the fate of affirmative action in the United States.
Both protests stretched for hours, saw multiple speeches from activists and Harvard students and alumni, and made one thing absolutely clear: when it comes to the admissions suit, divisions run deep.
The Crimson sent a team of journalists to spend the day chronicling both rallies. Below, relive a tumultuous 24 hours in Cambridge from behind the photographer's lens.
At 11 a.m., pro-College demonstrators began gathering near the Harvard Square T stop. Many dressed in special “Diversitas” t-shirts and clutched signs reading “#DefendDiversity.”
Above: Gregory Davis, a doctoral student in the African American Studies Department of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, takes the stage in Cambridge. Below: Thang Q. Diep '19, a Vietnamese College student who submitted his marked-up college application in court in an effort to defend the University, speaks at the Harvard Square rally.
The Copley Square demonstration kicked off at 12 p.m. when Harvard students, alumni, and locals began gathering outside Trinity Church. Many brought along their own signs.
Above: Edward Blum, the president of SFFA, mounts a stage erected in front of Trinity Church to address the hundreds-strong audience in Copley. He told the crowd that allowing the consideration of race in the college admissions process “ultimately fray[s] the social fabric of a nation.” Below: Pro-SFFA demonstrator Zhi Jiang (bottom photo) paid close attention to Blum’s words.
Back in Harvard Square, two protesters took a quick break from protesting to confer and crack a joke or two.
After rallying by the T-stop, pro-Harvard demonstrators marched from the Square to Cambridge Commons, chanting along the way. “No justice, no peace!” some shouted.
Meanwhile in Copley Square, protesters mostly stayed stationary.
Once they reached Cambridge Commons, some anti-SFFA demonstrators raised their fists and posed for photos to show their support for affirmative action.
Pro-SFFA protester Shelly Lee (above) and pro-Harvard demonstrator Jade O. Woods ’22 (below) offer a study in contrasts.

Pro-Harvard protesters march through Cambridge.
Several hours into the demonstrations Sunday, things got political. Members of Chinese Americans for Trump — a partisan group not affiliated with SFFA — showed up apparently uninvited to the Copley Square rally.
Their arrival drew mixed reactions; at times, arguments broke out between members of Chinese Americans for Trump and other SFFA supporters.
The protesters dispersed and returned to their homes late Sunday afternoon. By the next morning, the scene belonged to lawyers for both Harvard and SFFA. The attorneys stepped into the Boston courthouse — and possibly history.

Former White House officials recounted their experiences working in the West Wing and encouraged students not to lose faith in politics at a forum hosted by the Institute of Politics Monday.
At the forum, titled “West Wingers: Personal Stories of Public Service,” the four speakers each detailed their time spent working in the West Wing. The conversation was moderated by Aneesh V. Raman ’01, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama.
Soon after serving under the 44th president, the speakers — along with several other White House staffers — authored a book titled “West Wingers: Stories from the Dream Chasers, Change Makers, and Hope Creators Inside the Obama White House.” Gautam Raghavan, a former White House BGLTQ and Asian American Pacific Islander liaison, pitched and edited the book.
“Each chapter in the book is a personal story and a policy story, showing ways that, for each of us, our work at the White House became the work of our lives,” Raman said. “We push for new communities to have a seat at the table and for new voices to secure their place in the telling of the American story.”
During the event, panelists recounted some of their “coolest Obama moments.”
Raina Thiele, a former White House liaison for intergovernmental affairs, said she remembered one particularly humorous interaction she had with Obama. He'd just completed a historic trip to Alaska, making him the first sitting United States president to cross the Arctic Circle. The 44th president paused and asked her, "How'd I do?"
The speakers also recalled Obama's humility and his unwavering positivity, which they said persisted in the months following the 2016 presidential election. That election saw Republican nominee Donald Trump snatch the presidency from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton — widely seen as someone who would continue Obama's legacy — in an upset victory that shocked the nation and dismayed many in the West Wing.
Ned Price, a former senior director of the National Security Council, recounted how Obama comforted tearful White House staffers in the moments after Trump won. Obama told employees that “History zigs and zags; it doesn’t move in a straight line,” Price said.
Despite the hardships the five panelists said they at times experienced working under the 44th president, all said they stuck around because they had faith in Obama's vision for the country and his ability to accomplish it.
“I stayed fundamentally because I believed in Barack Obama,” Raghavan said.
Rumana A. Ahmed, a Kennedy School student and former National Security Council staffer, urged attendees not to focus only on the “now.” Ahmed insisted the audience remember that the conditions of American society today may result from struggle and unrest — but they also stem from historical resilience.
Attendee Drake E. Johnson ’22 said he is considering a career in politics and that he felt inspired after listening to the speakers discuss their time in politics. He said he gained valuable insight into the ways individuals can take simple steps to affect others around them.
“I’ve always wanted to have a great impact but I’ve always struggled with how to make that impact,” Johnson said. “I want to help instill hope and develop hope.”
When an audience member floated the possibility of the panelists running for office themselves, Ahmed responded with a clear message to voters: “I think it’s important to keep in mind that you don’t have to be running for office, but every single one of you here should be taking your own butts to vote — and get your friends to vote too.”

Leverett House Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras have quickly settled into their new positions following the departure of Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi at the end of the 2017-18 academic year.
The Georgis — affectionately known as “Chief” and “Coach" — served as deans of Leverett House for over 20 years and the pair played a major role in developing Leverett’s current identity.
According to Leverett resident Vitor DeFreitas ’19, Farrell and Ferraras have “big shoes to fill.”
“All of the parts of the House community have been working closely with us to make our transition easy,” Farrell and Ferraras wrote in an emailed statement.
The new faculty deans have maintained many of the traditions left by the Georgis, while also putting their own stamp on the House with new art.
“Monkey Bread and Math and Physics Night are still strong traditions at Leverett,” Farrell and Ferraras wrote. “The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies and the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research have very generously loaned us many pieces of contemporary art that are on display in the common areas of McKinlock.”
The new deans also have restructured the Senior Common Room experience for students in the house.
“We are actively building our Senior Common Room with new faculty and visiting scholars and will inaugurate a series of lunch talks in the spring to introduce them to our students," they wrote.
The new deans also hope to add a increased cultural and artistic elements to future Leverett Open Houses by “bringing student music groups.”
Freitas said he is optimistic for the future of the House.
“They’re really cool,” says Freitas. “They see the students and have lunch, have dinner with them.”
Farrell and Ferreras said they wanted to leave a legacy in the House of a culture of appreciation for the arts.
“The House will be known for Music, Art, International Culture and for Nature (that is, the M.A.I.N.) House!” they wrote. “As the largest House, we want to build a strong feeling of belonging and inclusiveness for all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of students met to discuss how the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh affected student life and mental health at Harvard on Monday night in the basement of Grays Hall.
The discussion, entitled “Being in and of the World: Do Societal Changes Affect Social Life at Harvard?” was the second in a Diversity Dialogue Series sponsored by the Office of Diversity Education & Support. The first event was a discussion about the affirmative action lawsuit against the University.
Diversity Peer Educators, who serve as student ambassadors to the Office of Diversity Education & Support, directed the conversation.
“Primarily, we just wanted to create a space,” Diversity Peer Educator Michelle Liang ’19 said. “The Kavanaugh case was really pressing and creating a lot of emotions that were just floating around and, at least for me, not necessarily having an outlet. As the DPEs, we just wanted to create a space where we could turn this energy into something productive.”
At least two women stepped forward in the weeks prior to Kavanaugh's confirmation to accuse the judge of sexual assault perpetrated decades ago. Undergraduate and graduate students protested Kavanaugh's nomination following the accusations, and called on Harvard Law School to bar him from returning in the winter to teach as a lecturer. Days before his confirmation, Law School administrators announced that Kavanuagh would not be teaching his scheduled winter course.
Hannah A. Lemmons ’20, a Diversity Peer Educator, said that the event allowed students to speak what was on their minds.
“The primary goal is to provide students a space to talk about issues that they might not necessarily get a chance to discuss in their daily lives,” Lemmons said. “Whether that means you don’t get a chance to talk about this with your friends [or] … an academic context, you can come to these dialogues and get some of those thoughts off your chest.”
While other campus support resources exist for students who have experienced sexual assault on campus, such as the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention & Response and the Title IX office, the peer educators said that they had a specific responsibility to create a separate event to process the Kavanaugh confirmation.
“OSAPR focuses on resources, providing resources to survivors. We’re more about creating a space for students, especially for talking and processing together,” Liang said. “We’re different from counselors in that respect too, because it’s more about opening up dialogues between students.”
Liang also said that the event specifically fell within the realm of the Office of Diversity Education & Support.
“What’s going on in the Kavanaugh case in the White House is the result of a lack of diversity and lack of diverse perspectives and diversity in background, race, gender. I guess where DPEs come into this is recognizing the harm that lack of diversity can cause and also the affirmative action case was really about that too, making sure that diversity continues to be a part of this campus," she said.
Some students attending the event said it was important to have a space on campus where they could discuss societal issues.
“The reason I really like these dialogues is because they allow me to self-reflect and bounce ideas off of other people, and by doing that, to refine my own ideas,” Sydney A. Lewis ’22 said. “It’s unlikely that I’ll come in feeling a certain way and leave with a completely new understanding, but I don’t think that’s the goal. I think the goal is more introspection and self-reflection and coming to term with your own views and also respecting the views of others.”
“[The discussion] was cathartic for me,” she added.
The next talk in the Diversity Dialogue series, “Culture or Costume?”, will be held on Oct. 29 and will discuss cultural appropriation in time for Halloween.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours before students were supposed to meet with administrators at an Undergraduate Council town hall to discuss the possible elimination of “shopping week,” the College’s embattled course registration system, Harvard officials announced they had changed their minds.
In lieu of the student-run forum, College staffers will instead hold Harvard-led events at which students can share their thoughts on shopping week, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh wrote in an email to undergraduates Monday afternoon.
A Harvard committee convened in Sept. 2018 and tasked with seeking alternatives to shopping week — the weeklong period during which students freely wander in and out of courses before officially enrolling — will host three “listening sessions” for undergraduates throughout October, according to Claybaugh’s email. Chaired by Philosophy professor Bernhard Nickel, the committee will spend fall 2018 exploring new ways undergraduates can sample and choose classes.
The committee will then formulate one or more proposals and present them to the Faculty Council, which will vote on the suggestions in the spring semester before passing the proposals to the full Faculty for a vote. The Council — the highest governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — voted to approve the convening of the shopping week committee at one of its biweekly meetings in September.
Claybaugh wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday that the Undergraduate Council “agreed” to replace its town hall with three administrator-managed sessions. Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, the chair of the UC’s Education Committee, wrote in an emailed statement that Claybaugh “informed us late last week” of the change of plans.
“Administrators said these three listening events will be more productive as they are directly with the faculty committee working on the alternative proposals that will be voted on in the Spring,” Palaniappan wrote.
Undergraduate Council representatives plan to hold a shopping week “organizing session” Tuesday in place of the cancelled town hall. As of Monday evening, more than 100 Facebook users had marked themselves as “Going” to the nixed event — and more than 200 had marked themselves “Interested” in attending.
In her message to undergraduates Monday, Claybaugh wrote Harvard administrators are “no longer certain that the benefits of shopping period are worth the costs.”
The shopping week committee’s formation comes after years of back-and-forth among Harvard professors over whether to alter the College’s course registration process. The debate reignited at the March 2018 faculty meeting when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana raised the topic, spurring denunciations of shopping week from several professors.
Khurana did not introduce a formal proposal to change Harvard’s class registration process at the time. Several months later, Claybaugh formally proposed switching to early registration at a September Faculty Council meeting. Under an early registration system, students would register for classes prior to the start of the semester.
The Council chose not to vote on Claybaugh’s proposal; it will instead wait for the shopping week committee to complete its work.
Multiple professors have said shopping week prevents them from planning for courses in advance and also creates uncertainty about the number of teaching fellows they need to train and hire. Graduate students have said the week of undergraduate indecision forces them into a state of limbo, unsure which courses they will be expected to teach.
In an interview earlier this month, FAS Dean Claudine Gay said she supports replacing shopping week with an early registration system.
Claybaugh wrote that the “listening sessions” will offer shopping week committee members more chances to hear from students.
“We wanted to have three sessions, rather than one, to multiply the opportunities for students to be heard,” Claybaugh wrote in an email.
Palaniappan wrote that she hopes the faculty committee will seriously weigh student input. She wrote the consideration of undergraduates’ voices should not become “just a formality.”
“Students need to be part of this conversation as shopping week is an integral aspect of the academic experience here at Harvard and something many people hold dear to their heart,” Palaniappan wrote.
Chloe A. Saracco ’21, who said she had planned to attend the UC town hall Tuesday, said she was “definitely disappointed” when she first heard the event was cancelled. But she added she is glad administrators will hold future listening sessions.
Without shopping week, Saracco said, “I would have been stuck in three or more courses that I would not have been excited about. I definitely want to express that to [administrators].”
The UC is currently surveying students to sample campus opinion on shopping week. The Council’s survey has garnered over 1,700 responses since representatives sent it out in early October, according to UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19.
Going forward, Zhang wrote in an email, the UC plans to “use [the survey’s responses] to inform the way we advocate, since the Undergraduate Council wants to first and foremost be representative of student opinion.”
The three listening sessions will be held at the following times in the following locations:
Thursday, Oct. 18 from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Kates/Tobin Community Room at Quincy House
Wednesday, Oct. 24 from 7 to 8 p.m. in the Fishbowl Room at Currier House
Tuesday, Oct. 30 from 7 to 8 p.m. in the Junior Common Room at Eliot House

The opening day of the highly anticipated Harvard admissions trial drew hordes of spectators and reporters — enough people to fill two courtrooms and a jury assembly room. Proceedings stretched from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. with a roughly 50-minute break for lunch around 1 p.m.
The first day went mostly as expected. Lawyers for both sides offered lengthy opening statements arguing their respective cases — Students for Fair Admissions asserted Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants, while the University vehemently defended its use of race in the admissions process. SFFA, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group, first sued Harvard over allegations of discrimination in 2014.
Adam K. Mortara, one of SFFA’s trial lawyers, spoke first, pointing to what he called clear statistical evidence proving that Harvard neglects to admit deserving Asian Americans in favor of less qualified applicants of other races. The University’s lead trial lawyer William F. Lee ’72 — the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — spoke next, referencing Supreme Court precedent he said demonstrates the College’s admissions process is legally sound.
After the attorneys finished, Harvard’s Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67 took the stand. He testified for over an hour, facing down a long string of largely technical questions from SFFA’s lawyers.
SFFA’s main line of questioning Monday centered around the group’s allegation that Asian-Americans must earn higher scores than Harvard hopefuls of other races to earn a coveted letter inviting them to apply to the College. Fitzsimmons did not deny the charges, but said Harvard crafts its outreach to high schoolers to ensure the school reaches “people from all backgrounds.”
The University’s top administrators — including former University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith — did not miss out on the action. Dressed in business formal attire, the trio sat together in the back left corner of the courtroom.
Faust, Khurana, and Smith watched silently as lawyers kicked off a trial that could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. The trial is expected to last for three weeks — but, no matter how Judge Allison D. Burroughs ultimately rules, the disappointed party will likely appeal and the case will likely make its way to a right-leaning Supreme Court.
Below, The Crimson breaks down the arguments and evidence introduced on Day One.
At 10 a.m., SFFA lawyer Mortara stepped to the podium to offer opening statements — and he did not mince words. “The evidence in this trial will show that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian-American applicants,” he said.
Mortara mostly stuck to previous SFFA talking points during his roughly hour-long speech.
He complained that Fitzsimmons and Khurana had chosen to ignore an internal Harvard study that concluded the school’s admissions process disadvantages Asian-American applicants. Documents made public as part of the suit over the summer revealed that the University’s Office of Internal Research concluded in a series of confidential reports circulated among top administrators — including Fitzsimmons and Khurana — in 2013 that the College’s admissions process produces “negative effects” for Asian Americans. College officials took no serious action to address the study at the time.
“Instead, Dean Fitzsimmons and Harvard decided that the system was working as they intended,” Mortara said.
He also pointed to another summer revelation: that Asian-American applicants to Harvard receive substantially lower ratings for their personal traits as compared to students from other racial backgrounds.
“The personal rating is crucial to admission for Harvard,” Mortara said. “You have let the wolf of racial bias in through the front door.”
Mortara noted that SFFA’s expert witness — Duke economist Peter S. Arcidiacono — “found a substantial penalty” for Asian Americans when he analyzed data related to Harvard’s admissions process. He added that Arcidiacono used a “conservative” statistical model that likely “underestimates” the extent of Harvard’s alleged discrimination.
Just after 11 a.m., Lee replaced Mortara to deliver Harvard’s opening statement. He began by naming and waving at the administrators in the courtroom including Faust, Fitzsimmons, Khurana, and Smith (some of them waved back). Lee argued the University’s top brass has never participated in discrimination against applicants of any race.
Lee mostly focused on precedent in his roughly hour-long remarks. He frequently pointed to previous Supreme Court cases which he said established Harvard’s method as a legal way to consider race in the admissions process.
He dismissed the statistical analysis conducted by SFFA-employed economist Arcidiacono. Lee quoted former Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and 17 other economists who, in a previous court filing, declared that analysis “simply not reliable” and its conclusions “implausible.”
“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything,” Lee said.
Lee further defended Harvard’s race-conscious admissions by pointing to the Supreme Court’s opinion in the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case. That case, Lee said, set the precedent that it is “permissible” to pay “some attention” to the numbers when crafting an incoming class of Harvard freshmen — though it is still forbidden to use racial quotas.
Lee also defended Harvard’s use of “soft” — or non-academic — factors to distinguish among academically exceptional applicants. He noted that, for the Class of 2019, more than 8,100 applicants to the College boasted “perfect” grade point averages. The students were competing for fewer than 1,700 spots.
Lee showed the court excerpts from an admissions office handbook that lists “tip” factors meant to help Harvard reviewers evaluate applicants. The factors included “outstanding and unusual intellectual ability,” “unusually appealing personal qualities,” and “geographic, ethnic, and economic factors.” A marked-up Harvard application a College senior previously submitted in court showed that school admissions officers paid close attention to the student’s personal traits and immigrant background.
“Harvard never considers an applicant’s race to be a negative,” Lee said. “If it considers race, it’s always considered in a positive light.”
Near the close of his speech, Lee said a Harvard applicant’s status as Asian-American does not affect his or her chance of admission. It’s “not distinguishable from zero,” Lee said.
Fitzsimmons — in many ways the man of the moment — took the stand at 2 p.m. to face examination from SFFA lawyer John M. Hughes. Fitzsimmons has served as dean of admissions since 1986.
Citing internal Harvard admissions documents made public as part of the lawsuit, Hughes asserted that Asian-American students must score higher than high schoolers of other races on the PSAT and SAT in order to receive a special letter inviting them to apply to the College.
Hughes specifically asked Fitzsimmons to explain why a white student with a PSAT score of 1310 would receive a letter while an Asian male who had earned a 1370 would not.
Fitzsimmons did not contest Hughes’s charges. But he vehemently disputed the notion that this method of outreach constitutes racial discrimination. He said Harvard’s recruitment method “is just about reaching out to people of all backgrounds, especially those with disadvantaged economic backgrounds.”
“What we are trying to do with the students who are not Asians is to get a sense of what extent economic background might make a difference in their ability to score on the PSAT or SAT,” Fitzsimmons said. “It comes down to the stark economic differences.”
Fitzsimmons said he wants to advertise Harvard in areas like “the heartland of America” where the university is not necessarily “on anyone’s radars.” The University currently faces a political climate in the United States that is increasingly hostile to higher education; President Lawrence S. Bacow recently traveled to Pontiac, Mich. to convince locals Harvard — and higher learning more broadly — isn’t so bad.

On Monday Oct. 15, 2018, a high-stakes and high-profile lawsuit alleging Harvard's admissions process is discriminatory went to trial in a Boston courthouse.
The suit, brought by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, charges that the College rejects deserving Asian-American applicants in favor of less qualified applicants of other races. Harvard has repeatedly and unequivocally denied all allegations of discrimination.
The case may wind up deciding the fate of affirmative action in the United States. The trial wrapped up in three weeks, leaving matters in the hands of Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who is expected to issue a final verdict — on her own, without a jury — some time in the next few months. No matter how Burroughs rules, though, the disappointed party will likely appeal. A cascading series of appeals could bring the matter before the Supreme Court, whose recent shift to the right — cemented by the appointment of controversial and conservative Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — means the nation's highest court will probably side with SFFA.
Throughout October and into November, Harvard affiliates, reporters, and curious members of the public packed into three crowded courtrooms every weekday to listen to University and SFFA lawyers do battle over the legality and viability of race-conscious admissions on college campuses. Trial proceedings — held in Courtroom 17 in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse — typically lasted from around 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
For the duration of the trial, The Crimson updated this article with a brief summary of what went down in the courtroom each and every day. Relive a tumultuous three weeks below.

Oct. 24, 2018
WHO: Three Harvard Admissions officials took the stand Thursday, as did a former analyst for the University’s Office of Institutional Research.
Harvard witness Mark F. Hansen, who currently serves as the Director of Research Technology at MIT’s Consortium on Financing Higher Education, took the witness stand to testify about his former work as an analyst for Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research. He was cross-examined by SFFA attorney John M. Hughes; Harvard lawer Felicia H. Ellsworth followed with her own direct examination.
After, Harvard witness Roger Banks — a Senior Associate Director of Admissions at the College who has worked at the admissions office since 1980 — testified about how race-related statistics are discussed at top universities. J. Michael Connolly from SFFA cross-examined Banks; Ellsworth again followed with direct examination.
After lunch, SFFA Lawyer Adam K. Mortara and University lawyer Ara B. Gershengorn ’93 questioned Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Senior Admissions Officer Charlene Kim.
Tia M. Ray '12, Admissions Officer and Director of the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, took the stand next to answer questions from SFFA Lawyer Katherine L.I. Hacker and then University lawyer Danielle Y. Conley.
WHAT: Harvard admissions officials repeated previous assertions that the University does not discriminate in its admissions process and that race is simply one factor among many that admissions officers weigh when evaluating candidates. Hansen again defended a 2013 OIR report that found the College's admissions system disadvantages Asian Americans.
In a moment of levity, Judge Allison D. Burroughs opened the day’s proceedings by referengin the upcoming Halloween festivities. She said she has been busy making sure her two boys have cool costumes. One of them plans to dress up as the character Link from Zelda.
For the second time during the trial, a representative from the OIR took the stand to defend the group’s 2013 internal report that concluded the College’s admissions policies produce “negative effects” for Asian Americans — a report Hansen insisted was preliminary and inconclusive, as Harvard has done since it became public in court filings this summer.
Hansen said his analysis “could provide evidence that Asians” were “disadvantaged” in the admissions process, but said it fails to account for all possible factors and that his models “do not establish causal relationships.”
Connolly questioned Banks about his consideration of race in admissions decisions. Banks said that, at full committee meetings held to make final admissions decisions, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 keeps officers updated on “where we are along a variety of planes” — including the burgeoning racial demographics of that year's class.
Connolly said he has “never” been told to admit more or fewer applicants from a certain racial background.
Charlene Kim, Banks’ fellow admissions officer, testified that she has never received written instructions on how admissions officers should use race when considering applicants. But she said Harvard's Office of General Counsel talks to the admissions office every year about the “legal landscape” surrounding the role race can play in admissions.
Finally, Ray took the stand. She fielded questions on the “lop” process via which admissions officers remove certain students to scale down the admitted class to an appropriate size.
Ray admitted that ethinicity, lineage, athlete status, and financial aid hold sway in the lopping process but said these are "not the only factors" considered.

Oct. 23, 2018
WHO: Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrapped up his testimony Tuesday and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Michael D. Smith replaced him behind the witness stand.
WHAT: Khurana continued to defend Harvard's race-conscious admissions policies, repeatedly asserting the school does not discriminate. Smith took fire over a committee he chaired months ago that explored race-neutral alternatives to the admissions process before concluding the College should stick to its current model.
— Staff writers Alexandra A. Chaidez, Delano R. Franklin, Iris M. Lewis, and Molly C. McCafferty contributed reporting.
***
Oct. 22, 2018
WHO: Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana took the witness stand for the first time Monday. He is the highest-ranking Harvard administrator to speak in court to date.
SFFA attorney Patrick Strawbridge directly examined Kahlenberg for the first half of the morning; Harvard lead trial lawyer William F. Lee ’72 followed up with a fiery cross-examination.
Later, Harvard College’s Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath '70 — who first took the stand Friday — answered a series of questions from Lee and from Students for Fair Admissions lawyer Adam K. Mortara.
After McGrath stepped down, Khurana took her place, facing off against Mortara.
WHAT: SFFA expert Kahlenberg argued that Harvard has not adequately explored race-neutral alternatives to its admissions process. In the afternoon, during a tense bout of questioning, Khurana said he is okay with the fact Harvard’s student body skews wealthy.
Lee questioned Kahlenberg’s legitimacy as an expert and — by extension — SFFA’s viability as an organization. He noted Kahlenberg has earned compensation from the group in the past
After lunch, Khurana took the stand wearing a blue sports coat and a purple checkered shirt.
Mortara pressed Khurana on whether the Harvard admissions process disadvantages Asian-American applicants and Khurana repeatedly insisted it does not. Mortara then asked whether Khurana is aware that, while the portion of U.S. households boasting an income of over $150,000 hovers around 5 percent, individuals in that income bracket make up roughly 30 percent of Harvard’s student body. Khurana did not dispute either statistic.
Mortara followed up by asking whether Khurana believes the socioeconomic makeup of the College’s student body should more closely match national demographics, to which the dean replied, “I don’t.”
“We’re not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States,” Khurana said. “What we’re trying to do is identify talent and make it possible for them to come to a place like Harvard." Read the full story here.

Friday, Oct. 19, 2018
WHO: A series of Harvard administrators took the stand Friday to face cross-examination from both SFFA and University attorneys.
WHAT: Bever defended Harvard's apparent failure to take significant action to respond to a 2013 internal report that concluded the College's admissions process produces "negative effects" for Asian Americans. Driver-Linn also discussed the report. McGrath faced a series of questions from SFFA lawyers about internal emails she exchanged with Harvard admissions officers and with her daughter.

Note: Overall admissions rate also includes Native American/Native Hawaiian, International, and Unknown/Other students.
WHO: The College's dean of admissions and financial aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 wrapped up his testimony and successive Harvard admissions officers stepped up to take his place behind the witness stand.
WHAT: Fitzsimmons walked through Harvard's admissions process in detail. Looby spoke about whether and how College admissions officers consider race when evaluating applicants. Bever took questions about a confidential 2013 report she helped produce that suggested Harvard's admissions system produces "negative effects" for Asian Americans.

Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018
WHO: The College's dean of admissions and financial aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 remained on the witness stand for hours on the third day of the Harvard admissions trial.
WHAT: Hughes sought to prove that Harvard unfairly favors the wealthy and well-connected in its admissions process. He then revived an earlier line of argument by referencing the confidential 2013 report that concluded the College's admissions system produces "negative effects" for Asian Americans. Lee, meanwhile, asked Fitzsimmons to describe the way Harvard evaluates applicants — and later gave Fitzsimmons a chance to discuss his own experience as a low-income College student in the 1970s.

Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2018
WHO: Day two of the Harvard admissions trial saw smaller crowds and further cross-examination of the College’s long-serving admissions dean.
William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, dean of admissions and financial aid, faced down several hours’ worth of questions from SFFA lawyer John M. Hughes.
William F. Lee ’72, a lawyer for the University and senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, objected to several pieces of evidence Hughes presented over the course of the day. After a prolonged discussion about the relevance of one particular document, Fitzsimmons offered a moment of levity.
“I’m sorry, what is the question?” Fitzsimmons asked, spurring chuckles. “Is there a question?”
WHAT: Hughes grilled Fitzsimmons on the technical details of Harvard’s admissions process. He was interrupted around 11 a.m. by a fire alarm that forced lawyers, spectators, and members of the press to exit the courthouse and wait outside for roughly an hour in the chilly October air.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday featured a very unique experience for the Harvard men’s golf team. Its H-Y-P match play event at the Rockaway Hunting Club on Long Island, N.Y., was composed of head-to-head matchups instead of its usual stroke play. Yale emerged from the event victorious, with Princeton in second and Harvard in third.
“The difference between stroke play and match play is the pressure element, and it really does favor people who are grinders and love to bear down in the moment,” junior Rij Patel said. “You have to be able to control that same element in different pressure situations.”
In the morning, the Crimson participated in six alternate-shot foursomes against Yale and Princeton. Harvard sophomore Peter George and junior Ryan Rhee would provide a memorable highlight in this first round. On the par four 10th hole, George started with a drive down the right hand side of the fairway. Rhee took advantage of this favorable lie by sinking his 71-yard shot for eagle.
However, this round was dominated by the Bulldog tandems. Each duo won its match against the Crimson and the Tigers, which made for a convincing opening performance. When it came to the matchup between Harvard and Princeton, the Tigers would come out on top.
A brief rest after this first round was followed by another 18 holes later in the day. The afternoon, on the other hand, was marked by singles matches between the Ivy League competitors. The Harvard team combined for a total of five wins, out of a possible 14, against Yale and Princeton. Despite not winning a majority, there were several bright spots for the Crimson.
“Everyone did a really good job, but one in particular was Rij Patel,” captain Aurian Capart said. “He was the only one who had a winning record on the team… and played really great golf all around.”
A birdie for Patel on the 18th hole clinched both of his afternoon singles matches. As a result, he finished the day at 3-1. This showing reflected Patel’s overall strong performance this fall, with a team-leading 71.63 stroke average heading into the weekend.
Capart offered up some late fireworks as well. A pair of birdies on his final four holes gave him the come-from-behind victory in one of his matches.
Nonetheless, the day belonged to the Bulldogs. They were not quite as assertive in the latter part of the competition but still very compelling. Captain James Nicholas, freshman Darren Lin, and senior Matt Smith all won both of their singles matches to complete a perfect individual 4-0 record for the trio.
Sophomore Guy Waterhouse and junior Evan Quinn would turn in strong performances for the Tigers as well. They won a match as a pairing, and both pulled out two singles victories, leaving each with a 3-1 record.
After combining the results from both rounds, Harvard would fall to both of its Ancient Eight rivals 6-4 and 9-2 to Princeton and Yale respectively, with the Bulldogs taking care of the Tigers by a score of 7-3 in their matchup. Even though the scorecards would not agree, the Crimson squad did take away several positives to conclude the fall season.
“We went into this event hoping to just give it our best, given that we don’t have much match play experience,” Patel said. “I think everyone had a lot of fun.”
The fact that the team enjoyed itself and was at full health is something that was not always the case earlier in the year, with numerous players unable to compete due to injury and sickness. The season was a tumultuous ride, filled with its fair share of ups and downs.
“We had to face a lot of adversity,” Capart said. “We had injured players, we had sick players, we played one tournament with only four guys. I think it would’ve been really easy to be discouraged… but everyone competed to do what we’re supposed to do. We continued to focus on the process and the controllable element.”
Harvard will have its chance to bounce back in the spring season, but there is a lot of time between now and then. This event, fun as it may have been, will still serve as a reminder for all the work that needs to be done. Each individual will be itching to take the necessary steps to improve in the offseason and then get back on the links.
“We saw what the other two Ivy League teams… had to bring,” Patel said. “I think we’re going to do whatever we can to really make sure that we can be as competitive as possible in the spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One play during the third quarter of Harvard’s clash with Holy Cross on Friday night effectively summed up the entire matchup.
Sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin secured the handoff from quarterback Tom Stewart and burst forward. Shampklin advanced 16 yards to the Crimson’s 38, but that’s where everything went awry. During a collision, his grasp on the ball faltered and all of a sudden possession was up for grabs.
Crusaders cornerback Josh Hicks scooped up the bouncing ball, but as soon as he appeared set on guiding his team toward Harvard’s end zone, he too fumbled. The Crimson’s John Stivers recovered and took the ball to his team’s 33 yard line. Gain of 11 yards, first down.
Harvard led for most of the contest, surrendered its lead in gut-wrenching fashion, and just as quickly settled down to reclaim its edge. Though Crimson fans may have been expecting their team to triumph more comfortably over Holy Cross, the final score is much more important than the way in which points find themselves added to the board, just as Harvard’s offense was more than content with an 11-yard gain after two fumbles.
“First of all, I don’t think I could be any prouder of our kids, every one of them,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We always talk situationally about [how to] expect adversity, to embrace adversity...and you’ve just got to fight through it. That’s all we did. We had to make play after play after play, after being 16 points up in the fourth quarter.”
CRUNCH TIME
Four plays during Harvard’s final drive stood out above the rest.
Facing third-and-two at the Crusaders’ 49, senior running back Charlie Booker jutted forward out of the backfield only to be enveloped by a mass of his own linemen and opposing defenders. The pile’s tug of war ultimately came up Crimson, as Booker forced the ball just inches past the first down marker.
Several snaps later and in a worse spot, Stewart took to the air on fourth-and-four. His throw found its target, as sophomore Tyler Adams corralled the pass just before absorbing a big hit. The sophomore maintained possession and again did just enough to move the chains.
On the very next play, Stewart hit Adams again. This connection was good for 30 yards, and it was on this play that Harvard dramatically increased its chances of winning. Without a large gain such as this one, the Crimson would have been in no man’s land outside of field goal range with a clock quickly ticking down to 0:00.
Last but not least, kicker Jake McIntyre delivered in a pressure-packed situation. With two seconds on the clock — and as a result no room for error — the junior was iced but coolly knocked the 25-yard kick through the uprights to seal the 33-31 victory as time expired.
With number one receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley out of action for the Holy Cross contest, Murphy had to toss another wideout into the mix. That receiver turned out to be Adams.
“Tyler’s obviously a great athlete,” Stewart said. “You saw him on that one quick slant over the middle, he was able to break a tackle and take it to the end zone. And then when we needed him the most he came up with a play and made a catch — a very tough, contested catch that was a pass interference. I believe in every single one of my guys regardless of what’s going on, and it was incredible. Incredible effort out of him and an incredible team win tonight.”
All told, Adams recorded 117 total yards, 110 more than he had posted in his collegiate career before Friday night.
Perhaps surprisingly, Adams was not the only sophomore receiver who caught his first career touchdown pass on Friday night. In the second quarter, James Batch grabbed a pass from Stewart to extend Harvard’s lead to 20-7 heading into the locker room.
BEND BUT DON’T BREAK
A consistent descriptor of Murphy’s defense this year has been “bend but don’t break.” The defensive unit did exactly that against the Crusaders this past weekend.
“I’m just really proud of the guys, the resiliency we showed,” said captain and defensive back Zach Miller. “It starts with those guys up front. They bust their butts every single down. They go unnoticed a lot, those D-linemen, and they’re some of the top guys in the league, so for them to establish the line of scrimmage two yards back, three yards back every play, that’s such a huge opportunity. And it’s impactful for the guys on the back end, the second and third level.”
Though this cannot be pinned entirely on the defense, as the offense and the special teams unit have struggled, the Crimson has blown double-digit leads in back-to-back weeks. Against Cornell, the defense was unable to counteract that of the Big Red, which held Harvard scoreless for the final 10 minutes. This week, however, the defense came up with a huge stop in the fourth quarter that allowed the Crimson time to get down the field for its game-winning drive.
After stuffing Stewart on a fourth-and-five run, there appeared to be a buzz on the Holy Cross sideline. The visitors commanded a slim one-point lead, but they would get the ball back with just over five minutes remaining on the clock.
As it had all game, though, Harvard’s run defense stepped up to the task. Crusaders running back Domenic Cozier took the handoff three times in a row, and he lost five yards in the process. Just like that, the Crimson procured a crucial three-and-out to return possession to Stewart and his offensive cache.
NOT SO SPECIAL
With one half of the season in the books, it has become clear that Harvard has made a number of costly mistakes on special teams that have cost the team points and have disrupted its offensive rhythm.
The team has surrendered two safeties thus far. The first came against Rhode Island when freshman punter Jon Sot was pinned back against his own end zone, received a difficult snap, and booted the ball off his own lineman’s back. On Friday night, Stewart found himself in a similar situation in which the snap simply flew high and out of the end zone.
It may surprise some to learn that the most recent safety occurred directly following a kickoff. With the current kickoff rules, it is difficult not to advance the ball to at least your own 20, but this time, an apparent miscommunication led to return man Adam Scott having to make a desperation dive to stop the ball on his own two yard line.
After regrouping from the safety, the Crimson had to offer a free kick from its own 20. Holy Cross picked up an early first down on this drive, but that is all it would get, as junior defensive end Brogan McPartland sacked quarterback Geoff Wade to force a punt. On this punt, Harvard would make another costly special teams mistake. Returner Henry Taylor muffed the fair catch, and the Crusaders’ Cristos Argys recovered at the Crimson’s 13. This change in possession allowed Wade to hit receiver Martin Dorsey to put Holy Cross up, 31-30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday the Harvard men’s soccer team (3-9-0, 1-2-0 Ivy) participated in a hard fought match against Brown (6-5-0, 1-2-0) that ultimately ended in a 1-0 loss for the Crimson. Brown earned their second straight victory and its first Ivy League win of the season.
After this weekend’s games, Princeton remains at the top of the Ivy League with seven points by keeping an undefeated conference record (7-4-1, 2-0-1 Ivy). Brown and Harvard are tied for sixth with three points each.
The Crimson went into the game after another very close 1-0 loss against Boston College in a non conference game on Tuesday October 9th.
“We felt pretty good going into the game even though we lost midweek at Boston College,” Harvard captain Sam Brown said. “We actually played really well and dominated large spells of that game so I think everyone was pretty confident going into Saturday. And I think whenever we have a good week of training which we did, guys are more confident and there is no sense of nervousness.”
This most recent match for Harvard went into double overtime. The only goal of the game was scored in the 103rd minute by Bears' senior forward Toby Howell. This was the third game of the season that Brown won in overtime this season.
Under the lights at Stevenson-Pincince Field in Providence, R.I., the game winning play began when junior midfielder and Bears' leading goal-scorer Daniel Schiller ran down the left flank of the field and sent a cross towards the Harvard goal. Howell put himself in striking position and hit the ball first time into the back of the net. It was Howell’s second goal of the season.
Despite the low score, there was plenty of action throughout the match. In the 68th minute Brown had a scoring opportunity when Howell dribbled down the right side of the field and passed the ball to freshman midfielder Nicolas Perez. Perez’ shot went just wide of the net.
With just ten minutes left in regulation, Harvard senior forward Cesar Farias Jr. fired a shot on target, but Bears' keeper freshman James Swomley managed to leap into the air and knock the ball over the crossbar to keep Brown in the game.
Once regulation play ended, the game went into overtime, which was two ten minute halves. In the first half of overtime, Harvard took the only two shots, even though on the pitch Brown had most of the possession.
“Brown gave us a good amount of space in the midfield and we probably had most of the ball that we had all year so we had a lot of possession,” Brown said. “So I think that with possession comes more chances to create opportunities which led to more shots obviously. I think we kind of settled down probably midway into the first half and then we kind of carried that momentum into the second half as well and had the ball for large chunks of the second half.”
The Crimson left the match with impressive statistics. Harvard outshot the Bears 8-7 in the first half. The team had a season high of 16 shots with 2 on goal. Sophomore goalie Matt Freese was solid in the net with four saves. Freshman forward Alfred Perez and freshman forward/ midfield Nico Garcia- Morillo led the Crimson’s offense with four shots each. Harvard also had seven corner kicks throughout the game.
This is a significant difference from Harvard’s previous game against Boston College where the Crimson had 10 shots total and 2 on goal. Looking forward to their next game against Princeton, the team hopes to carry similar momentum and offensive success.
“Everyone was obviously pretty disappointed and down just because we were not happy to lose in overtime and then obviously in the Ivy League it’s tough because each game matters so much,” Brown said. “We haven't thought of any major changes, maybe one or two minor adjustments, but that also comes with preparing for what Princeton brings. So we will try to look at them and see what they have and see where we can kind of exploit them.”

For many who have advanced through Tommy Amaker’s basketball program at Harvard, one common theme is prevalent: a challenge to excel beyond the basketball court and truly make a genuine difference in the community.
Two former members of the program, All-Ivy standout Brandyn Curry ‘14 and team manager Mike Evans Ed.M.’11, have exemplified this message through prolonging their relationship outside the walls of Lavietes Pavilion.
For Evans, the idea to develop his own non-profit called Full Court Peace preceded his time in Cambridge. The former Hamilton College graduate was playing professionally in Northern Ireland in 2006, a country embroiled in political tension amongst Protestants and Catholics even in the post-Good Friday years. While in Belfast, Evans recognized the opportunity to transform his passion for basketball into a unifying force for children growing up in this polarizing milieu.
“Basketball there was not tied to a religion,” Evans said. “...The youth basketball community was very small, so it was an opportunity to unite Catholic and Protestant youth together. That was the catalyst for the idea.”
A few years of hard work later, Full Court Peace began to see a noticeable impact in Belfast as basketball served as a vehicle to reduce animosity and bridge together largely isolated groups. Children were bonded together through sport, and Evans recognized an opportunity to expand his “pilot” project across the globe. In the past 10 years, Full Court Peace has organized service trips to Cuba where Americans and local Cubans work together to revamp run-down basketball courts. In addition, the non-profit organizes cross-background camps and leagues in Fairfield County, Conn., where socioeconomic gaps are amongst the largest nationally.
“The repeated interaction, the repeated winning and the repeated losing creates bonding for the kids,” Evans stated. “...What we’re trying to do now is to have more of our trips to represent what we do in Connecticut, which is bringing together the have and the have-not communities.”
Shortly after turning over control of the Belfast program in 2009, Evans enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Education with hopes of elevating his non-profit and boosting his knowledge in sports diplomacy. Here, the former overseas athlete decided to remain invested in basketball and became a student manager for the Harvard Men’s Basketball team in 2010-11.
For Brandyn Curry, it was Evans’s persistent dedication to the sport that first stood out when the two first met. The Huntersville, N.C., native had just come off a stellar rookie season for the Crimson.
“You could tell [Evans] was an extremely hard worker, going to school and working hard for us,” Curry said. “He would also be working hard playing basketball, he would shoot after and work on his own game. So you could tell he really loves the game.”
The numerous conversations between the Crimson star and graduate student manager continued even after Evans earned his degree from the Ed. School in 2011 and the future sociology graduate signed his first overseas professional contract in 2014. While still cementing his basketball career first in Holland and later in Germany, Curry began to explore options for giving back and quickly connected back to Evans’s work with Full Court Peace.
“I am in a position where I am fortunate to be able to do what I want to do for a living, to get to play overseas,” Curry said. “I definitely want to give back as much as I can... I had been keeping up with Mike [Evans] and everything and I looked more into what he was doing and it was just perfect.”
Curry added that the core philosophy of Full Court Peace as an organization to unite people of varying backgrounds particularly stood out to him.
“Basketball has done a lot for me, it has changed my life and it took me to places I never would have been without it,” Curry said. “It is such a powerful game and using it to change the lives of kids all around the world, it is how I should give back.”
The former Crimson guard’s contributions to Full Court Peace extend beyond his financial donations as one of the non-profit’s only monthly donors. Through his relationship with Wendell Maxey—a sports media veteran who worked with Brandyn during his first two years playing professionally overseas—Curry was able to partner with a Boston-based apparel company called XvsO Sports.
This company, in which Maxey is now the VP of Marketing & Media, specializes in representing memorable sports plays as works of art on t-shirts and posters. Examples of memorialized plays include the ‘Minneapolis Miracle’ catch by Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs or Duke legend Christian Laettner’s “The Shot”.
“There are these plays that might capture a moment in time but there is usually a story,” said founder and designer Mark Guarino. “If you put the moment in context you [realize] what the story is all about. It is usually what makes it more interesting.”
In recent years, XvsO has also sought to partner with athletes like Curry in order to create customized shirts of their most renowned moments. For the Harvard graduate, three shirts were created under his name and available currently for sale: The ‘Lefty Dunk’ play in Harvard’s defeat over Yale on February 18, 2012; Curry’s ‘Game Winner’ while playing for Dutch team Den Bosch in 2015; and most recently, the ‘Corner Three’ in the 2018 DBL Championships in Holland.
This project became more than just a commemoration of the Crimson alum’s personal moments. Here, Maxey and Curry recognized an opportunity for the t-shirts to be used as a platform for good. In reaching back to Evans and Full Court Peace, the two decided to form a partnership where a portion of the sales for Curry’s shirts would go toward Evans’ non-profit.
“The amazing thing was that Wendell and Brandyn came to me, and said that if there was to be a charitable component to it, [they] wanted to incorporate Full Court Peace,” Evans said.
“It was a win-win for all of us,” Maxey added. “...if people support what [Full Court Peace] is doing, they can purchase a shirt even if it is not for them. The shirt is basically the canvas. And what happens between those lines with Mark [Guarino]’s creativity as a designer and us saying, let’s collaborate and work with some people.”
This initiative has continued to today as Curry transitions to playing in the top-tier French professional league for ESSM Le Portel this season. Throughout this process, many working around Brandyn have appreciated his desire to contribute to organizations like Full Court Peace and help fellow athletes realize a larger perspective to their careers.
“Brandyn really sees the opportunity to go beyond his own achievements by starting to promote some of these other amateur athletes,” Guarino stated.
For Curry, much of this mentality and willingness to engage in partnerships like that between him, XvsO Sports, and Full Court Peace connect back to his time in Cambridge under the guidance of Coach Amaker.
“Coach Amaker is really big on being more than just a basketball player, really being a role model, taking an initiative to give back to your community, because we are all blessed to attend Harvard University,” Curry said.
This Crimson connection made on the basketball court nearly 10 years ago has lasted to the present, connecting together shared goals between business and non-profit. With all three parties—Full Court Peace, Brandyn Curry, and XvsO Sports— still in their developmental trajectories on and off the court, it is the appreciation for the role of sport and basketball that has been the unifying factor throughout this collaboration.
“I see firsthand how powerful the game of basketball is,” Curry concluded. “...Basketball brings us all together and I think it is a really powerful tool when used the right way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team pulled off a thrilling rally against Brown, improving to 6-5-1 on the season with 3-2 win over the Bears in Providence, R.I. The Crimson scored three goals in the second half to take down the Bears (5-7-1, 1-3-0 Ivy League) in its first come-from-behind victory since rallying to beat Yale in October of 2016. After surrendering two goals early, Harvard (6-5-1, 3-0-1) bounced back with second-half goals from sophomore Murphy Agnew, senior Leah Mohammadi, and freshman Taylor Nielsen.
“I was incredibly impressed with the way we bounced back,” said Crimson head coach Chris Hamblin. “The team was very resilient.”
Brown came out with a potent offensive attack and gained early momentum because of the scoring opportunities they had at the start of the game. One of the Bears’ top scorers, Star White, found the back of the net in the fourth and sixteenth minute to propel Brown to a 2-0 lead. Both these goals came against set pieces that exploited Harvard’s defense. According to Hamblin, the Crimson will work on their defensive setup against set pieces in order to prevent these types of goals from happening for the rest of their games this season.
Following their two quick goals at the outset of the game, the Bears managed to shutout Harvard for the remainder of the half with strong defensive play that stifled the Crimson’s offensive attack.
Unphased by Brown’s two goal lead, Harvard went into the second half determined to rally from behind and win the game. They were more aggressive on the offensive side of the ball, pushing the ball up the field, and securing more scoring opportunities that would allow them to put the Bears’ defense on edge.
Senior midfielder Leah Mohammadi was instrumental to the Crimson comeback, by setting up quality shots on goal and scoring herself. The Upland Calif., native’s impressive efforts in leading their rally earned her the distinction of Ivy League Player of the Week.
Mohammadi and the rest of the Harvard team began their comeback early in the second half. In the 49th minute, Agnew capitalized on the setup given to her by Mohammadi and freshman Jillian Wachira, scoring from 20 yards out to finally get the visitor’s squad on the board.
The goal, Agnew’s first of the season after countless close calls through the first 11 games, was instrumental in swinging the momentum towards the Crimson. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year would return the favor to the senior by helping to set up Harvard’s equalizer in the 70th minute. Agnew drew a penalty that was then slotted home by Mohammadi, for her team-leading seventh goal of the season.
The Crimson would complete their comeback with a breathtaking sequence near the end of regulation. With seven minutes left in regulation and the game in a deadlock, freshman Jordan Diverniero had a long flip-throw to put the ball into play. Freshman Sophie Hirst would then cross the ball to her fellow first-year Taylor Nielsen, who broke the tie with a powerful volley into the back of the net.
Harvard would shut out Brown for the rest of the game and secure the 3-2 victory. The comeback win puts the Crimson into a tie for first place in the Ivy League standings and improves their record against the Bears to 28-19-4.
Having struggled so long when playing from behind, the win was an example long in the making of the Crimson’s revamped offensive abilities. Saturday’s game illustrated how the youth movement, with ten rookies all being given substantial playing time, has given Harvard a new identity after a trying 2017-18 season on the offensive side of the ball.
After the game, Coach Hamblin was thoroughly pleased with his team’s performance and the resilience they displayed. To keep up the momentum, Coach Hamblin stated, “We need to continue our offensive threat and work on our early defense.”
Harvard’s next test is an enormous one. With just three games remaining, in order to stay atop the Ivy league, the Crimson will have to take down Ivy giants Princeton on the road next Saturday at 1 PM EST (ESPN+).
