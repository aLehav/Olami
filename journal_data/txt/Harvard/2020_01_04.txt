After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a move that demonstrates how poisonous and untrustworthy the American electoral process has become, Spotify recently announced that beginning in 2020,it will no longer air political ads on its streaming service. The company follows in the footsteps of Google and Twitter, who announced nearly the same thing earlier this year. Twitter is ceasing all political advertising, while Google continues to permit it but only with significant limitations.
Spotify’s move is a good idea. How many of us want a playlist to be interrupted by ads, only to hear a candidate’s voice slowly drawl when all you want is the music to resume or an ad to sell you something useful? I jest, of course, but the fact that politics have infiltrated everything we consume should alarm us more than it currently does.
There’s a link between many of the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign announcement dates — well before June 2019, even though voters won’t go to the polls until November 2020 — and the presence of political ads on Spotify. Since at least 2008, America’s presidential races have been all-consuming, lasting years at a time. They plaster the front of newspapers, infiltrate many of our discussions, interrupt our music, and take up such a large part of our psyche that it feels like we are perpetually electing someone new. We elect a president and then take up our pitchforks to usher in the next.
This never-ending cycle leads to campaigns that are constantly reaching for any measure to reach constituents. Never mind that Canada and the UK manage to elect their leaders via a five- or six-week campaign right before voting begins.
The Verge reported that only Bernie Sanders and the Republican National Convention have run ads on Spotify, which is a relief. (It’s not the entire field!) It’s interesting that only those two camps chose to run ads on the platform, to which many young people and Millennials subscribe. Sanders polls well among young people, while the RNC desperately needs to gain the demographic in order to continue winning elections.
That Spotify ran such ads in the first place is a distortion of the very process by which Americans elect a president. Ideally, we would read about candidates’ policy proposals or ideas, then compare and mull over the choices. What thoughts of substance can be adequately conveyed in 30 seconds or less? Such advertising speaks to the American tendency to reduce everything to a sound bite, something that we can digest without much thought or engagement.
The updated policies of Spotify, Twitter, and Google show us that this oversimplification touches all the media that we consume, and further suggests the reason behind the mess that was 2016. Deliberately making things simple, as a Spotify ad inherently must be, misrepresents how difficult it is to craft meaningful policy on climate change, health care, jobs, and infrastructure.
These problems are hard, and they require complex solutions that cannot be explained quickly. The concept that we have to be able to get a beer with our future president is easily transmitted via an ad, but quite frankly, why should I want to get a beer with the chief executive? The very notion is absurd. I want them to have thought-out, cogent, and ambitious ideas — and if they take a while to explain, that’s fine.
It’s ironic that even though information about the 2020 campaign is everywhere, cutting through the noise is actually quite difficult. It is absolutely a good thing that large tech companies are stepping back to let people do the thinking for themselves. Meaningful engagement with our candidates can only occur with intentionality, and away from the blippy media clips that are cannot replace serious reflection about an election that really began in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marc B. Ackerman, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and the director of orthodontics at Boston Children’s Hospital, is at the center of a growing controversy surrounding SmileDirectClub, a teledentistry company that is a part of an emerging industry of lower-cost, mail-order teeth aligners.
In September, a dentist sent a written complaint to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and to other employees at the School of Dental Medicine and Boston Children’s Hospital alleging that Ackerman violated ethics standards in his research on products made by SmileDirectClub, per the Boston Globe.
In October 2017, the American Association of Orthodontists filed complaints in 36 states alleging SmileDirect’s treatment was unsafe. Former patients complained of cracked or misaligned teeth and chronic jaw pain. In Massachusetts, consumers and dental organizations have filed a dozen formal complaints against SmileDirect with Attorney General Maura Healey.
The Journal of Dental Research and Reports published an article in May 2019 by Ackerman analyzing the “clinical effectiveness” of SmileDirect technology. In it, Ackerman favorably reviewed the SmileDirect treatment — which costs under $2,000, compared to the at least $5,000 that traditional braces often cost.
University Spokesperson Jonathan Swain confirmed that Bacow received an emailed communication with concerns about Ackerman. The email was also addressed to individuals at the School of Dental Medicine, per Swain.
“Based on that, the response was handled by the Dental School and Bacow did not respond directly,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement, referring further questions to the School of Dental Medicine.
Heather Denny — the director of communications at the School of Dental Medicine — declined to comment.
“Because Dr. Ackerman is not an employee of Harvard School of Dental Medicine, but rather Boston Children’s Hospital, we are not able to provide comment on this,” she wrote in an email.
Kristin Datolli, a spokesperson for Boston Children’s Hospital, also declined to comment,
“We don’t comment on issues related to our staff members,” she wrote in an email.
In 2018, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Dentistry also investigated allegations that Ackerman and other dentists who were using SmileDirect technology were violating Massachusetts regulations by providing substandard care, though the board did not take disciplinary action.
Ackerman also did not declare any conflicts of interest at the conclusion of his May 2019 paper. He told the Globe that was standard practice, because he was not paid for the research and he designed the study himself.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Ackerman denied having “financial interest” in SmileDirectClub.
“It is important to note that I do not receive any financial compensation nor do I have any financial interest in SmileDirectClub,” he wrote.
However, the Globe reported that Ackerman “acknowledges” receiving financial benefits from SmileDirectClub, including payment for expert testimony and fees for treating digital patients on SmileDirect. The Globe also reported that SmileDirect has donated $176,000 to the American Teledentistry Association — a nonprofit founded and run by Ackerman out of his home — over the past two years.
Ackerman, however, stressed in his email to The Crimson that his work at the American Teledentistry Association is “on a volunteer basis.”
Ackerman wrote in an email to The Crimson that he is “not disputing the fact that complaints have been filed” against SmileDirect, but is “not in the position to judge” the bad experience of individual patients, such as those profiled by The Globe.
“It is my understanding that out of 750,000 patients treated by the SmileDirectClub platform, the Massachusetts Dental Society selected just seven cases to refer to the state attorney general’s office,” Ackerman wrote. “As a comparison, I perform several dozen second opinions every year for patients who have been in traditional treatment with braces and now have severe problems. As with any dental (or medical) procedure, there are likely to be some instances of failure.”
Liz Brady DiTrapano, a spokesperson for SmileDirectClub, declined to comment and referred The Crimson to statements in the Globe.
Jeffrey Sulitzer, who serves as chief clinical officer at SmileDirect, told the Globe that teledentistry exams such as those conducted over SmileDirect’s platform are as efficient and safe as in-person exams, “if not even more.”
Sulitzer said in a statement to the Globe that SmileDirect meets the standard of care by having “state-licensed doctors managing, prescribing, and directing the care from the very beginning to the very end.” Licensed dentists review photos and scans of SmileDirect customers’ mouths and can edit treatment plans before approving them and during progress checks every three months.
In his email to The Crimson, Ackerman defended his nonprofit and teleorthodontic technology, although he said there are still “ways to improve teledentistry.” He stressed that he was speaking from his role as the executive director of the American Teledentistry Association, not as an employee of Boston Children’s Hospital.
“Through the nonprofit association, we created an organization whose mission is to increase access to dental care through advocacy for and implementation of innovative teledentistry guidelines and solutions that reach a much larger population, many of whom reside in underserved areas,” Ackerman wrote in his email. “There are critics who do not like this alternative approach because it means competition for traditional and potentially more costly solutions.
“Ultimately, the promise and potential of teledentistry is about more than one clinician,” he added. “It’s about harnessing the technology at our disposal to create efficiencies and provide greater access to dental care, much like we see with telemedicine.”
