After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of November, the Navajo Nation finally settled its 2012 lawsuit against Urban Outfitters, Inc. The tribe took issue with the fact that Urban, a multinational clothing corporation, had been using the “Navajo” name to brand lines of products. Flasks, panties, and socks with tribal patterns were, in fact, sold with the term “Navajo” at Urban Outfitters and some of its subsidiaries, such as Free People and Anthropologie.
The case for copyright infringement extended beyond just a name. The Navajo Nation holds dozens of trademarks for its name, clothing, footwear, textiles, and more. By appropriating the tribe’s name, Urban Outfitters put Navajo artisans and crafters at risk. While the terms of the resulting settlement are confidential, statements released spoke of future collaborations between the retailer and the Navajo Nation.
Urban was far from the first major corporation to step on the toes of smaller artisans. In July, Los Angeles designer Tuesday Bassen realized that Spanish retailer Zara and its subsidiaries were using replicas of her hand-designed patches. After hiring a lawyer, Zara’s legal team reportedly responded to her cease-and-desist letter: “The lack of distinctiveness of your client’s purported designs makes it very hard to see how a significant part of the population anywhere in the world would associate the signs with Tuesday Bassen.” In other words, Zara’s legal team was attempting to argue that Bassen’s designs weren’t recognizable enough to count as legitimate infringement.
Bassen took to Instagram to post a note about her grievances, which caught the attention of her friend Adam J. Kurtz, another designer. Kurtz had previously noticed a knockoff of his designs on one of Zara’s subsidiary brands and got the item removed after complaining. But seeing Bassen’s post, he realized the problem was more than a one-time occurrence.  He and Bassen researched other artists that Zara had copied and displayed them on a website, shoparttheft.com.
The size features dozens of original designs from independent artists that are strikingly similar to Zara’s. Nor is Zara alone in receiving accusations from small designers. In October, Kohl’s became embroiled in a similar case. Topshop, Versace, and Forever 21 have all previously had to deal with comparable allegations. One possible theory for the recent uptick in these types of cases is the wide availability of designs on social media. Big retailers may (intentionally or not) find themselves consulting Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest posts or reposts from artists advertising their products—not offering up designs for free. But as of now, this harmful practice does not seem to be widely recognized. Shoppers keeping up to date on the latest legal action may realize that the creative work they enjoy wearing does not, in fact, originate in the places they purchase it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On November 25, 2014, the Harvard men’s basketball team took to the court at Lavietes Pavilion to take on Houston in what at its best could be categorized as a trap game before the Crimson’s annual matchup with UMass and at its worst was an opportunity for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to give his reserves some action before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Houston coach Kelvin Sampson had recently returned from an NCAA-imposed hiatus from college basketball and would lead his team to a 10th-place finish in the American Athletic Conference that year. Amaker and the Crimson were riding high on that November evening. Harvard would go on to finish the season 22-8 and win a share of its fifth consecutive Ivy League title. The hosts took the contest in dominating fashion, 84-63.
In the two-plus years since the teams last met, the tables have turned. A veteran Cougars team rolls into Friday night’s matchup at Hofheinz Pavilion (8:00 PM, ESPN2) riding a three-game winning streak. Houston has picked up victories in nine of its first 11 contests.
The Cougars will most likely be the best team the Crimson faces during its nonconference slate and Houston is playing better right now than any of the other seven Ivy League teams. The Cougars are ranked 48th in the most recent Pomeroy College Basketball Rankings. For context, Harvard is ranked 155th and the highest-ranked team the Crimson has faced this season, Stanford, comes in at No. 80. While no one is getting this year’s Houston team confused with the Phi Slama Jama teams of the early 1980s, Sampson’s bunch looks like it has a shot to break the school’s six-year NCAA Tournament drought.
Harvard (4-4) has also won its last three contests but has struggled to play a full 40 minutes to begin the season. The Cougars are a perfect 6-0 at home, with its best win coming against a Rhode Island team that began the season ranked 23rd in the nation. It has been 16 days since the Crimson’s last contest, as the team has not scheduled games over finals period since 2008. Amaker is 4-3 in the first game back after the long break.
The good news for Harvard is that Houston’s Achilles’ heel is in the interior. In its two losses, the Cougars have conceded a total of 86 points in the paint and 36 offensive rebounds. Freshman forward Chris Lewis and senior center Zena Edosomwan will play key roles for the Crimson as it attempts to exploit this weakness. Lewis had 22 points against Boston College and his team finished the contest with 34 points in the paint.
While Lewis and the rest of Harvard’s freshmen have had the scoring touch of late, co-captain Siyani Chambers has been the catalyst for the Harvard offense. The senior has posted double-digit assist outputs in each of the Crimson’s last three contests. Harvard has had five different leading scorers through eight games this season.
Houston’s offense goes through a pair of upperclassman guards. Junior Rob Gray and senior Damyean Dotson both average over 30 minutes a game and combine to give Sampson 36 points per contest. Gray is a pure scorer who is adept at getting to the free throw line while Dotson, a transfer from Oregon, can stroke the three while also fighting for rebounds as the larger of the two wings. Sophomore point guard Galen Robinson, Jr. gets the offense cooking for the Cougars. The local product averages six assists per game and joins Gray and Dotson in averaging 30 minutes a night.
The big question mark for the Crimson on the defensive end is how it will defend Houston’s three-headed monster along the perimeter. Amaker has opted for a smaller starting lineup during the three-game winning streak, with freshman forward Seth Towns sliding down to counter the opponent’s power forward and wing Justin Bassey or point guard Bryce Aiken covering a wing.
Co-captain Siyani Chambers will be on Robinson and Amaker will likely task sophomore shooting guard Corey Johnson with covering Dotson, according to Harvard’s “shooters know shooters” mantra. Whether it is Towns, Bassey, Aiken, or some combination of the three covering Gray, the Crimson will need to frustrate the AAC’s second-leading scorer on the offensive end in order to have  a chance at winning. The Cougars as a team are shooting nearly 50 percent from the field and are only averaging 10.2 turnovers per contest. Harvard has not allowed an opponent to shoot above 47 percent on the season.
The game will be a homecoming for junior Zach Yoshor. The 6’6” guard starred at Beren Academy, a small, Orthodox Jewish Day School in Houston. Yoshor led the Stars to the state finals as a junior and to the semifinals during his senior season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not a creature is stirring in Cambridge as most Harvard students have headed home for the holidays, but in Houston, the Harvard men’s basketball team, tore open the shutters, threw up the sash, and came away with an important road win over Houston. Though the team at one point fell behind by nine points in the second half, freshman Bryce Aiken scored eight points with what seemed like a wink of his eye and a twist of his head to put the Crimson back in the game and eventually dash away with a 57-56 win.
HEATING UP FOR THE HOLIDAYS
After starting the season 1-4, Harvard (5-4) has won four straight games—beginning with a 64-52 victory over Fordham on Dec. 3. With the five wins, Harvard has begun to find its identity, based off of a small lineup spearheaded by senior co-captain Siyani Chambers and freshmen Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns.
Chambers, the team’s “quarterback” according to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, has been one of the most effective point guards in the country, dishing out 7.6 assists per game. Towns and Aiken have taken charge of the scoring, averaging 12.8 and 13.5 points per game, respectively. The trio has typically been joined by sophomore guard Corey Johnson, the team’s best shooter, and one of two bigs—either senior Zena Edosomwan or freshman Chris Lewis—to hold down the paint.
It is the second year in a row that Amaker has had to break in a young team. Last year, the Crimson competed in the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu following the break in play for final exams, and outperformed expectations by defeating Brigham Young, Auburn, and leading Oklahoma—an eventual Final Four team—at the half.
While Houston (9-3) doesn’t compare to the likes of the 2015-2016 Oklahoma team, it represents one of the hardest games in Harvard’s schedule this year as it is the highest ranked non-conference opponent for the Crimson according to Ken Pomeroy. Prior to facing the Crimson, the Cougars were scoring over 82.7 points per game. Harvard however, held Kelvin Sampson’s team under 60 points on 33.9 percent shooting from the floor.
The win comes just over two weeks before the Crimson kicks off its Ivy League schedule, facing Dartmouth on Jan. 7. Harvard was picked second in the preseason Ivy League rankings, but with the implementation of a playoff tournament to determine the team that goes to the NCAA Tournament, the team with the best record at the end of the season will not necessarily represent the Ancient Eight in the Big Dance.
BRYCE IS ON THE NICE LIST
Amaker calls Chambers the team’s most important player, but on Friday night, Aiken stole the show. After a quiet first half in which the New Jersey native scored just one field goal and Harvard shot under 30 percent from the floor, Aiken came alive in the second half.
As the Cougars stretched the lead to nine with 6:21 to go in the game, Aiken held the ball behind the arc before driving by several defenders for a bank shot to pull his team within seven. A Houston bucket and a layup by Harvard freshman Justin Bassey kept the deficit at seven. Ninety seconds and two threes by Aiken later and the Crimson was back within one, 54-53.
Overall, the freshman tied a season-high with 21 points—tying his output in the season opener against Stanford in Shanghai.
On the defensive end, Aiken was tasked with guarding Houston’s leading scorer Rob Gray in the backcourt. Though Gray led the Cougars with 15 points, the total was less than his typical 20.5 per game, and required 21 shots from the floor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Friday’s matchup against Houston, Harvard freshman Bryce Aiken was shooting 24 percent from beyond the arc. With a little over five minutes left in the second half, however, that didn’t seem to matter too much to the freshman.
After driving into the lane and missing a tough layup, Aiken grabbed his own rebound and hit a corner three to put the Crimson within four. After getting a stop on the other end, Aiken came back and hit another to put Harvard within a possession, 54-53.
After the two teams traded layups, and with a just over a minute left on the clock, Houston redshirt senior Damyean Dotson drove into the lane and threw up a floater that would have given the Cougars a three-point lead. Senior Zena Edosomwan had other plans.
After swatting the floater, Edosomwan ran the floor and seconds later Aiken found him for the layup. 57-56 in favor of Harvard.
Edosomwan’s late layup would prove to be the go-ahead bucket as a last-second heave for Houston (9-3) would bounce off the iron into co-captain Siyani Chambers’ hands.
The upset by the Crimson (5-4) was perhaps as unexpected as the fashion in which the guests won the game. In a matchup where two of Harvard’s primary scorers—freshman Seth Towns and sophomore Corey Johnson—combined for four points, it would be a combination of defense and some clutch shooting that gave the Crimson the late victory.
Despite the late game heroics, Harvard came into the second half having given up an early seven-point lead. Through the first 15 minutes of the game, the Crimson would draw plenty of contact en route to 11 of its first 25 points at the line.
The points at the charity stripe would prove to be pivotal as Harvard shot only 28 percent through the first period. Beyond the shooting woes, the Crimson also struggled on the boards early—through the first half the Crimson was outrebounded, 24-18.
Though the Crimson struggled to make buckets late in the first, the defense came together to shut down Houston’s two leading scorers. Through the half, Harvard held Dotson and redshirt junior Rob Gray to nine points on 3-of-16 shooting. For its part, the Crimson was held scoreless for a period of over four minutes late in half.
Despite an 8-0 run from the Cougars in the last four minutes of the first period, Harvard would close the half on a dish from Chambers to freshman Henry Welsh that would cut the Cougar lead to four as the buzzer sounded.
In the second half, Harvard would go on and off much like it had throughout the first. After a jump shot from Chambers five minutes into the half cut the Houston lead to three, the Crimson wouldn’t score for another five minutes. For their part, the Cougars had built up their lead to nine in that span.
Late in the game though, Aiken took over. After going 1-of-3 from the field for eight points in the first half, he would go off for 13 in the second on 3-of-4 from deep while adding two steals and the go-ahead assist. He would finish the game with 21 points, three assists, and three steals.
Fueled by Aiken’s consecutive threes, Harvard closed the game on a 10-2 run to extend its winning streak to four and hand the Cougars their third loss of the season.
