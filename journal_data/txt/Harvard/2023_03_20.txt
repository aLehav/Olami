After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring has sprung! Or at least, that’s what we told ourselves as we fled our dreary Cambridge campus for a much-deserved respite (well, some of us stayed behind and braved the cold).
Click on the markers of the map below to follow The Crimson Editorial Board’s spring breakers as they experienced the filmic camaraderie of college sports, the reverence of suburbia before the crack of dawn, and even a lizard. With Punxsutawney Phil’s predicted six weeks of winter coming to an end, we’re all refreshed and ready to finish out the spring semester in actual spring weather.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The course registration period never fails to fill us with a sense of wonder. If you are like me, at the end of each break, your Crimson Cart is filled to the brim with any class that you have any interest in at all, and your August and January days contain hours of perusing Harvard’s manifold course offerings in search of hidden treasures.
Fresh from our time spent away from campus, our stores of curiosity replenished from the crushing weight of the last semester, we bask in the endless opportunities before us: to try out a new subject, to broaden our grasp of our field of concentration, or even to fill a credit that brings us closer to the promised land of graduation. All of it fills us with a sense of possibility that pushes us to read dozens of syllabi for classes we will likely never take, to spend hours game-planning our weekly schedules, and to show up to the first one or two lectures of the semester well-rested, with a new notebook and fresh pens, ready to learn.
Now, as we return from spring break and begin the concluding half of the semester, does anybody still feel this sense of wonder?
We’re two months out of the course registration period, and I would wager that most of our current sentiments toward academic pursuits share very little in common with this beginning-of-semester sense of wonder. We aren’t nearly as excited about school as we used to be.
It doesn’t take long for the excited curiosity of the beginning of the term to wear itself out. For some, it might be the first 20-hour problem set that does it. For those more inclined towards the humanities, like myself, it could be the first 3 a.m. night cramming a Frankfurt School reading for Social Studies 10B tutorial — and the week with three essays due that follows it. No matter which way you cut it, our classes lose much of their luster by the time we reach spring break, and the week-long recess does little to restore it. Father Time is not kind to the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed students who walked into the first lecture with a spring in their step.
No matter how hard we try to stay excited about our intellectual experiences, it seems that a kind of motivational decay is inevitable. “Burnout” tends to make us cynical and uninterested in the activities we have chosen to fill our days. Part of this unhappy descent seems inescapable: As more assignments and responsibilities pile up, our aspirations lower from the realm of pure intellectual curiosity to that of ensuring our academic self-preservation. Part of it is also a lack of novelty: As we spend more and more time within a class, no matter how engaging, the attraction it had during registration period must wear off.
But I am not content to let that be the end of it. After all, wouldn’t we all be more fulfilled with our academic lives if we could sustain the sense of amazement we possessed at the very beginning of the semester? This requires treating our academic pursuits as not only means to a professional end but, at least in part, as ends in themselves. It means holding onto the raw curiosity that fuels our love of learning and prompts us to study what we do.
I don’t profess to know the solution. Perhaps professors and teaching fellows designing courses should be more attentive that volume of work often trades off with the desire to do that work. Perhaps the academic calendar could incorporate more frequent breaks or wellness days.
But, in the end, the task of staying curious falls to us as students. We all find ourselves faced at times with the specter of hundreds of pages of reading, plus an essay, plus a pset. We should lose the all-or-nothing mindset, common at least to our high school selves, that encourages GPA and resume maximization at the expense of enjoyment. (God knows I am guilty of that mindset). Instead, we should recognize that we get only 32 Harvard classes over four short years and try to take advantage of those classes to the very fullest.
We are here not simply because we are capable but because we are curious and eager to learn. As easy as it is to forget our natural curiosity, we would all do well to remember how excited we were at the very beginning of the semester — and try to the best of our ability to find that feeling again. We should take the hiatus of spring break as an opportunity to renew our academic energy.
Maybe we can find the magic again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I like to dance. But I have been met with amused bafflement at my two dance-related decisions on campus, from friends and strangers alike: one, my recent choice to join Candela, Harvard’s Latin social dance group, and two, the fact that I have not once been in the Asian-American Dance Troupe since I “seem like I’d be in AADT.”
Of course, these comments were made without malice. But the surprise that my (Asian-American) Candela dance partner and I would love to salsa, and my odd sense of shame at not being in AADT (like it’s some rite of passage for any Harvard east-Asian girlie who ever had a K-pop phase) made me cognizant of the unspoken cultural borders divvying up campus organizations.
That is, we could and should do better with intercultural dialogue — while protecting how Harvard student organizations cultivate their own flourishing spaces.
Why the emphasis on diversity? Well, it leaves a weird taste in my mouth to have to “prove” this claim, but having a wide variety of friends makes you a better human. Research has revealed that a lack of meaningful interaction with those of other racial groups leads us to be less open-minded, resort to stereotypes, and to assume everyone’s reality is similar to ours. In fact, one synthesis of 515 studies found that the more contact people had with those outside their racial group, the less prejudiced they were.
Unfortunately for us, one study based on 2007 national survey data found that friendships formed in college are among the least likely to be racially diverse compared to those formed in other environments. So even though Harvard admits a diverse pool of undergraduates, we (including myself, I admit) may be forming increasingly homogeneous social circles. (Though, it’s worth pointing out that people of color do a better job: According to a 2022 study from the Public Religion Research Institute, Hispanic, AAPI, and Black Americans are much less likely than white Americans to have racially homogeneous friendship networks).
Still, as mentioned, we should still protect enclaves at Harvard that allow students to embrace their identities and create community. This is especially true for smaller and/or historically marginalized groups where it may be harder to find others that empathize with, and don’t speak over, your nuanced experiences. Case in point: In 2019, students at a Harvard forum called “The Role of Asian Cultural Organizations on Campus” called out the overrepresentation of East Asians in “purportedly pan-Asian spaces” — implying that we shouldn’t broadly prioritize intercultural groups over smaller, but more empowering and safer spaces of belonging.
***
You may argue that bridging cultural groups isn’t a huge problem, since we can meet friends unlike us in many ways, like classes or non-culturally-affiliated clubs.
However, even amongst diverse classmates, we often experience homophily, the tendency to gravitate towards those similar to us. Furthermore, our classes might not be representative due to histories of racial exclusion in certain fields. For example, in Harvard’s admitted Class of 2026, 15.2 percent of Harvard’s admitted class of 2026 identify as African-American and 12.6 percent identify as Hispanic or Latinx. By contrast, a 2022 survey revealed that each of these groups make up only 9 percent of undergraduates at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. So, given this self-segregation tendency and these patterns of historical underrepresentation, maybe your problem set buddies are more homogeneous than you realize.
Likewise, non-cultural organizations can still be dominated by certain identities, which may result in a feeling of implicit exclusion. No wonder our students have nurtured countercultural spaces to explore areas they’ve historically been unwelcome in from Lavender Room Magazine, which is centered on diversity in fashion; to LiFT, which represents Harvard Latinx in Finance and Technology; to HSBSE, the Harvard Society of Black Students and Engineers.
***
So what do we do? We should be more open-minded, but we shouldn’t collect “diverse friends” like Pokemon, nor intrude on safe spaces that communities create for themselves.
Honestly, dance — and any cultural form of expression — is a great middle-ground to start dialogue. Harvard’s Ghungroo, a dance and music showcase centering South Asian culture and the diaspora, does this well: Not only is it a stalwart of South Asian belonging at Harvard, it also actively welcomes — and successfully includes — eager non-South-Asian students regardless of dance experience.
Still, when making these spaces open to genuine allyship and curiosity, how do we not have marginalized groups sacrifice emotional labor and their sense of safety to cater to outsiders that might harbor superiority complexes for being culturally woke? (I think of those self-satisfied white dude influencers that surprise Chinatown locals with fluent Mandarin.)
A potential answer is collaboration. Some clubs are doing it already — from Harvard Creative Writing Collective’s poetry reading last semester with the Black Arts Collective and the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, to a discussion of bodily femininity recently co-hosted by the Asian American Women’s Association and South Asian Women’s Collective. However, such collaborations take a lot of intentionality and resources to plan — so the Harvard Undergraduate Association or the Harvard Culture Lab Innovation Fund, which supports initiatives fostering diversity and belonging, should more explicitly fund and encourage intersectional events.
***
As a first-year, I helped start The Wave Asian Arts Magazine, intended to pioneer pan-Asian creativity on campus.
But when it veered towards East Asian creators, and when that same year, Ghungroo created its own South Asian arts magazine, I felt like I failed. And I still feel that it’s important to strive for equitable representation, and to find collective empowerment through what we find in common.
But maybe I should’ve viewed that “failure” as a chance to converse with other groups. Communities have the right to forge their own spaces, so perhaps, proactive solidarity is just as important as inclusion: to have all our voices heard, the way we want them to be.
Anyway, I’ll be performing at Cultural Rhythms this Saturday with Candela (I’m nervous!). If you’re there, I’d love to bond with you over our familiarities or unfamiliarities with the merengue, K-pop dance, or the famous guest they have yet to reveal (I’m hoping it’s Lizzo).
And I hope that initial camaraderie we foster makes it easier to converse candidly when we meet again: about our hobbies, our histories, our hopes. After all, it’s always wonderful to find another friend to experience the world with.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth, who is currently a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights, will join Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs as a visiting professor for the upcoming academic year.
Roth will complete his fellowship at HKS, which concludes at the end of the fall semester, during his first semester at Princeton. In January, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf reversed his controversial decision to block Roth’s fellowship, allegedly over Roth’s criticism of Israel, following widespread backlash from students and faculty.
“My fellowship with the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy was originally planned for the current academic year,” Roth wrote in a statement to The Crimson. “Because of Dean Elmendorf’s initial veto of my fellowship, because of my criticism of Israel, we have now been obliged to switch the fellowship to the current calendar year.”
“Although I will have overlapping responsibilities next fall, I will do what I can to spend time at Harvard,” he added.
Roth lauded Princeton for including human rights instruction as part of its public policy curriculum. Roth is a fierce critic of the Israeli government for practices he has consistently labeled as “apartheid.”
“It understood the importance of teaching and developing this methodology as a key element of a public-policy education,” Roth wrote of Princeton. “It wasn’t the least bit concerned about my criticism of Israel.”
Roth wrote he is “greatly” looking forward to becoming a professor, though he admitted he had “a bit of trepidation” regarding teaching full courses for the first time in his career.
“I have spoken at many universities and taught plenty of individual classes, but have never taught an entire course,” Roth wrote. “I was eager to take on this new challenge, and feel that I have much to contribute in describing how human rights are enforced.”
“I look forward to elaborating in class on this broader method of enforcement to help build the next generation of human rights defenders,” he added.
Princeton SPIA Dean Amaney A. Jamal said in a press release from the school that Roth will bring a “valuable perspective” to the school’s curriculum.
“We are thrilled to have him join our faculty, further diversify our interdisciplinary approach to advancing public policy, and help continue our work to make a positive difference in the world,” Jamal said.
Roth wrote he plans to teach “a methodology that, while developed to address governments, can be used to improve the behavior of a range of institutions, even Harvard.”
Roth will return to HKS during the week of April 17 to host a variety of speaking engagements, interact with students, and be “actively involved with the Harvard community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department will undergo an independent external review in the aftermath of the police killing of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal in January, city officials announced in a press release Friday.
The Police Executive Research Forum, a think tank led by police chiefs across the U.S., will evaluate CPD practices and release findings to the public after the conclusion of the review. A team of seven policing experts and three non-police affiliates will lead the investigation.
Faisal, a Bangladeshi American student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was shot and killed on Jan. 4 by CPD after officers responded to a 911 call reporting a man harming himself, the department said in a January press release. Faisal allegedly approached officers wielding a knife before he was shot, according to the press release. The shooting is currently under investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
Faisal’s killing sparked months of protests across Cambridge and calls for reform to CPD and funding for police alternatives. City officials have pledged to reform the city’s policing practices, promising to implement body cameras for officers and fund an alternative emergency response program.
City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 wrote in an update Sunday that the city has “moved rapidly” to adopt a body cameras program and made “significant progress” with its newly-formed Community Safety Department, hiring a coordinator and assessing emergency calls that could be rerouted.
The city is also set to release a procedural dashboard in the summer, displaying arrest, citation, and summons data to assess equity in the city’s justice system.
In the Friday press release, Huang said he hopes the external investigation will improve the city’s policing practices.
“Bringing on PERF is one of several commitments we are in the process of implementing and they have a strong record on police reform and helping departments make meaningful changes,” Huang said.
CPD Commissioner Christine A. Elow said in the release that the external review will likely include recommendations on non-lethal alternatives, emergency response for mental health crises, and crisis response.
Boston Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Joe Tache said he feels the review is not sufficiently independent, noting that the Police Executive Research Forum’s board of directors consists entirely of police chiefs.
“It really doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Tache said of the review. “What the city can do and should do to primarily show that steps are being taken to address the injustice of Faisal’s murder is to address that case in particular.”
Tache also called for officers involved in Faisal’s killing to be named and criminally charged, and said the city should release the full unredacted police report, demands that protesters have reiterated numerous times.
The names of the officers involved and the police report will be released following completion of the District Attorney’s investigation.
Organizers are set to hold another protest outside City Hall on Monday to demand further action from the city. Cambridge officials have agreed to a Tuesday meeting with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a group which has been actively involved in the protests over Faisal’s killing, according to a Sunday post on the group’s Instagram account.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III reflected on his tenure and his transition to Brown University amid the search for his successor in an interview Wednesday.
Doyle, who was appointed SEAS dean in 2015, is set to step down on June 30 and assume the position of provost at Brown. Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay officially kicked off the search for Doyle’s successor early last month by announcing a 13-member faculty advisory committee for the search in a schoolwide email.
Doyle said in the interview that his departure from SEAS was “a very difficult decision.”
“The hardest part was leaving the team that I had been lucky enough to build and to collaborate with here at SEAS across our staff, across our faculty, our student body,” he said.
Doyle said he hopes his experiences managing the bustling SEAS and facilitating its expansion into Allston will translate to success in leading Brown’s plans to grow its campus and research programs.
“The research agenda at Brown is one that’s growing and they have a very aggressive plan to grow that,” Doyle said. “There are opportunities for Brown to grow their footprint within Greater Providence.”
Though the ongoing search for Doyle’s successor as SEAS dean has solicited feedback from affiliates of the school, Doyle said he is not involved in the process.
Following his departure, Doyle will hold professor emeritus status at SEAS. He said he has “a keen interest” in the continued success of the school.
Doyle said he expects the growth at SEAS to translate into further success for the school.
“I can’t help but, as an engineer, sort of think about things in terms of slopes and velocities,” he said. “So, if we think of a trajectory that SEAS is on, I believe there’s a very positive slope for many years to come.”
“I’m gonna watch with envy, I’m sure, with a lot of excitement from Providence,” Doyle added. “I’ll be an absolute cheerleader for the exciting things that are going to be happening in Allston.”
Doyle also discussed the following topics:
SEAS is currently in the fourth year of its five-year Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Strategic Plan. Doyle praised the plan, adding he believes there has been “incredible progress” on most of its initiatives.
A climate survey conducted last year by SEAS showed racial and gender disparities within the school, with 21 percent of respondents reporting experiences of discrimination or harassment. Doyle said the administration is using the findings of the survey to develop the next phase of the plan.
“We're trying to incorporate the learnings that have come out of that survey, incorporate the ideas that lead back to responses we’re hearing in the listening tour, as we go around the community and use that to refresh, revise, and now forecast what the next five-year plan would look like,” Doyle said.
“It’ll be for my successor with the incredible team that we’ve assembled to continue to do that,” Doyle added.
Doyle highlighted additional SEAS initiatives to bolster diversity in the school, including the school’s Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Fellows program, its April BRIDGE Week — which stands for Building Relationships, Increasing Diversity, and Growing Engineers — and its collaborations with historically Black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, such as its partnership with Navajo Technical University.
“We really, I think, bring a long tradition of partnering that can become an exemplar,” Doyle said. “Not only can we sustain and improve those relationships, but they may inspire us as to other kinds of partnerships that Harvard can undertake.”
Approximately half of SEAS faculty and staff moved to the Science and Engineering Complex in early 2021 after its roughly five-year construction, which was prolonged by the Covid-19 pandemic. Doyle said his successor will have new opportunities to expand SEAS’ outreach in Allston.
“A big part of our presence in Allston, I believe, is to be effective ambassadors for Harvard, to the community that we are joining with, that we’re embedded in over there,” Doyle said.
“You’ve got Athletics, you’ve got the Business School — it’s been close to a century on both of them that they’ve been over there,” he added. “We’re the next wave and so we have always embraced the opportunity to be good neighbors with the Allston community.”
A new chapter of expansion for SEAS is set to take place with the establishment of the Enterprise Research Campus in Allston, which will host a hotel, conference center, laboratory and office space, and residential housing. The first phase of the construction of the complex was unanimously approved by the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s board of directors in July 2022.
“I think the final piece in many ways of the exciting puzzle that’s coming together is going to be the Enterprise Research Campus,” Doyle said. “The sky’s the limit on what can happen when you bring tech companies, startups, outposts of big organizations in adjacent to our labs and our classrooms.”

Major nonviolent protests with higher levels of youth participation are more likely to be successful, according to a study by the United States Institute of Peace in collaboration with Harvard Kennedy School professor Erica Chenoweth and lecturer Zoe Marks.
The study, which examined maximalist campaigns — mass movements seeking territorial independence or the ousting of an incumbent national government — also showed that movements with large LGBTQ+ youth participation tend to achieve more democratic outcomes, even if the movement itself is unsuccessful. Following the conclusion of the campaigns, however, young people in the affected areas do not see improvements in their political standing, according to the study.
“Young people are really important in shaping their country’s political future, and yet there’s still some pretty persistent barriers, structural barriers, to young people achieving political power,” Marks said in an interview.
The reason for the correlation of youth participation with democratic outcomes remains unknown, but Matthew D. Cebul — the research officer of the study — wrote he suspects it may be because young people are largely excluded from political office.
“Nonviolent action campaigns give youth a voice that they don’t otherwise have, and young people use that voice to demand reforms from sclerotic and corrupt governments that are poorly responsive to society’s needs,” Cebul wrote in an email. “Addressing these demands tends to improve the quality of democracy in a country, even if campaigns fail to achieve full regime change.”
The research was proposed by USIP, who reached out to Chenoweth and Marks because of Chenoweth’s Women in Resistance Dataset, which cataloged women’s participation in 338 maximalist campaigns in order to help identify their impacts in movements and their outcomes.
According to Marks, the pair had already planned on expanding the dataset — known as the WiRe dataset — beyond the gender binary.
“That was really the impetus for us to work together because we had the data and they had a policy audience that they thought could benefit from our research,” Marks said.
The study used the WiRe dataset to assess the level of participation of different demographics in each movement. With the help of a team of research assistants, Chenoweth and Marks then researched each of the movements to look for evidence of LGBTQ+ or youth involvement before translating the extent of that participation into numbers.
“I was incredibly excited to get involved in this research especially since it’s incredibly understudied — the extent to which young people and also queer and trans people have been involved in making larger policy demands that aren’t necessarily specific to identity,” said Ketaki Zodgekar, an HKS student who worked on the project.
The study also found that movements with more youth participation tend to be more disciplined than those with lower levels of youth participation.
“Youthful movements are not more violent. In fact, they’re just as peaceful as ones with lower levels of youth participation,” Marks said. “But the state is much more likely to treat them as violent and attack them, basically, with violent repression.”
Cebul wrote the study’s findings support current U.S. government initiatives to empower the youth to civically engage and encourage movements to involve young people in their activism but also cautioned that young people are more at risk in large-scale campaigns.
“The solution is not simply to tell movements to ‘just include more youth!’ That work needs to be done in an ethically responsible way, one that reflects the elevated danger that youth activists face when participating in non violent activism,” Cebul wrote. “The goal should be to empower youth with the skills and experience they need for the long-term, not just to get them out into the streets in the short term.”
In addition to conducting research together at the Kennedy School, Chenoweth and Marks are finalist candidates for the faculty dean position at Pforzheimer House. The couple intends to build a strong house culture and promote diversity initiatives if selected for the role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni advocacy group that aims to promote diversity and equity at the University, announced endorsements for five candidates in this year’s Board of Overseers election.
The Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, offers advice on the direction of the University and provides guidance to top Harvard administrators. The Harvard Alumni Association Nominating Committee announced eight candidates in January for the five expected vacancies on the Board.
The Coalition on Thursday endorsed Arturo Elizondo ’14, CEO of a climate-conscious food tech company; Fiona Hill, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and chancellor of Durham University; Vanessa W. Liu ’96, a former Harvard Alumni Association president and tech entrepreneur; Robert L. Satcher Jr., an associate professor at the University of Texas and former astronaut; and Luis A. Ubiñas ’85, a non-profit leader.
Michael G. Williams ’81, a member of the Coalition’s board of directors, said in a Sunday interview that the group looks for candidates that have “the strongest history of advocacy and accomplishments in terms of diversity initiatives, equity and inclusion, and also issues related to racial justice.”
The Coalition supports the creation of an ethnic studies department at Harvard, calls for greater transparency from the Board of Overseers, and promotes race-conscious admissions policies at the University.
Williams said that all five Board of Overseers candidates endorsed by the Coalition pledged to advocate for the expansion of ethnic studies offerings if they are elected.
“Ethnic studies advocacy is a key part of the Coalition’s work going back to the beginning,” Williams said. “We appreciate the progress that has happened over the past couple of years, but definitely there’s a lot of work to be done.”
“Because of that, that was an important consideration as we decided which candidates to endorse,” he added.
The Coalition also endorsed six candidates for HAA elected directorships: Barbara R.J. Barreno-Paschall ’07, a lawyer and vice chair of the State of Illinois Human Rights Commission; Rudy N. Brioché, vice president of global public policy for Comcast; Judith L. Norsigian ’70, an author and women’s health advocate; Yvonne O. Osirim ’01, co-chair of the HAA’s Anti-Racism Working Group and executive director of human health ethics and compliance at Merck & Co.; Theodora M. “Theo” Skeadas ’12, executive director of Cambridge Local First; and Jason W. Young ’04, tech entrepreneur and former adviser to President Obama.
The endorsements were co-signed by eight other alumni affinity groups, including the First Generation Harvard Alumni, Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, and Harvard Black Alumni Society.
Eight of the 11 candidates endorsed this year are members of the Coalition, while all but one of those endorsed for the HAA elected directorship positions are members of the group.
This election cycle is the eighth year the Coalition has endorsed candidates for the Board of Overseers. Last year, 10 out of 12 candidates endorsed by the Coalition won election.
In addition to the eight candidates put forward by the HAA Nominating Committee, Harvey A. Silverglate — a free speech advocate — is staging an outsider run for a seat on the Board. Silverglate is hoping to win election through a write-in campaign following an unsuccessful signature-gathering effort earlier this year to appear on the ballot.
Harvard Forward, a student and alumni group that supports increased recent alumni representation and support for fossil fuel divestment, did not field candidates for the Board of Overseers election for the second year in a row.
Harvard Forward-backed candidates who joined the ballot through petition campaigns enjoyed success in previous elections. Three candidates supported by the group won election in 2020 and one candidate won a seat in 2021. Harvard’s governing boards, however, approved recommendations in 2020 that limit the number of Overseers who are nominated through petitions to just six seats at any given time.
Voting — which will be conducted through both online and paper ballots — is scheduled to open on March 31 and close on May 16. All Harvard graduates who have received their degree by Jan. 1 are eligible to vote in the elections. Alumni currently in positions of governance or instruction at the University are not allowed to vote in the Board of Overseers elections.
Correction: March 20, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that 11 other alumni affinity groups co-signed the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard’s endorsements. In fact, eight affinity groups did so.

New research at Harvard’s Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology sheds light on how infections can alter the social behavior of animals.
In an article published in Nature, Harvard OEB professor Yun Zhang and her colleagues studied the effects of the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the small roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. The study specifically examined hermaphrodite roundworms, which are capable of self-reproduction.
Prior to infection, hermaphrodites exhibit a preference for self-reproduction; however, infection by the bacterium causes an elevated interest in the opposite sex. Zhang’s team discovered that infection alters the response of the host’s neurons to pheromones, which are secreted chemicals that trigger social responses in animals.
“We first found that a pair of chemical sensing neurons that usually do not sense pheromones start to respond to pheromones after worms were exposed to pathogenic bacteria,” Zhang said. “That was surprising because we did not know that this pair of neurons would respond to pheromones.”
The altered neuron causes a change in social behavior that could harm the host when interacting with other organisms of the same species. According to Zhang, pathogens may manipulate host organisms to aggregate more, thus increasing the pathogenic transmission rate.
Zhang’s team first encountered this project while working on a different research question. Taihong Wu and Minghai Ge, both postdoctoral fellows in the Zhang lab and co-first authors of the paper, were surprised when the pair of sensory neurons interacted with pheromones after the infection.
“It’s very important that after they found this surprise, they did not dismiss this finding,” Zhang said. “They actually stuck to this problem and tried to understand why and how this happened. That actually led us through this trajectory of the new project and opened a new direction of research.”
While this study is not directly related to human behavior post-pandemic, Zhang said it could be extrapolated to study the effects of pathogens on different organisms.
“There are lots of observations and studies that have examined social behavior changes in different animals,” Zhang said. “For social behaviors that are changed by interaction with pathogens, it is possible for people to look at whether in their organism of interest, pheromone receptors are also regulated and then whether this is the way that social behavior is changed in the host.”
“But what we do not yet understand a lot is how those social behaviors are changed at the level of the nervous system, at the level of the individual animals,” she added. “That’s where our findings contribute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Providence, R.I. –  With 18 seconds left on the clock in a tight game that had gone back-and-forth for the entire 60 minutes, Harvard men’s lacrosse head coach Gerry Byrne called a timeout to draw one last play to tie the game and send his Crimson squad into an overtime battle against the Brown Bears.
The tension in the crowd was palpable as sophomore attackman Sam King resumed play on the right wing, made a shifty move down the right side as sophomore middie Miles Botkiss set a pick for him, and hit a flying first-year attacker Teddy Malone cutting around the left side of the crease. Malone found time and space on the doorstep with the clever play, and was able to bury the ball as the defense looked to rotate to slide to the dodging force of King. The play was strategic because it drew up several options for the offensive trio: King could drive if the pick gave him room and none of the defenders slid, Cheek could pop off of the pick for a give-and-go in the middle of the fan, or the move could free up King to take advantage of the frantic defenders.
“Coach Hutchinson drew up a great play, and Sam gave me a great ball. I had the easy job. Sam made the play happen,” said Malone of his late game-tying goal.
Despite the Crimson holding the lead for almost the entirety of the game, Brown was able to even the score and then take the lead with less than two minutes left to play. Individual efforts by Brown sophomore attackman Aidan McLane, who put up seven goals, and Brown sophomore attackman Matteo Corsi, who tallied three goals and an assist, kept the Bears nipping at Harvard’s heels. McLane was the standout player from the Brown squad, and along with junior goalie Connor Theriault, who tallied 16 saves, kept the teams neck-in-neck for all four quarters.
“[McLane’s] really talented, he’s really slippery, he’s both handed, we scouted him like that, and we just didn’t play one-on-one like we were supposed to. And, when we did collapse, the slide was just a little bit late,” first-year defender Charlie Muller said. “I was caught going to his strong-hand lefty, even though he has a really strong right hand; I gave him a foot of space and he got it in the net. We have to be a little bit better at guarding, and it’s something that we’ve been working on in practice.”
The game was much tighter than predicted, as Brown was missing seven senior contributors who are suspended until March 25th, a sentence that had been reduced from an initial April 7th blacklist. The seniors not dressed for the game were attackman Devon McLane, middies Logan Paff, Griffin King and Topher Bligh, SSDM Trevor Yeboah-Kodie and defensemen Oscar Hertz and Ben Palin.
The game marked the highly anticipated Ivy League opener for each program, with both teams only having faced non-conference opponents at this point in the campaign. Both the Crimson and the Bears were coming off of bad losses – Brown suffered a crippling defeat at the hands of powerhouse UNC 19-6 on the Tar Heels’ home turf, while Harvard blew a substantial lead against the University of Michigan and failed to recover.
“Taking that loss to Michigan gave us a little kick, and we all had to look at ourselves in the mirror this week and find little ways to get better, whether that’s on the ride, on defense, or on special teams in the middle of the field,” senior captain and middie Nick Loring commented.
The game mirrored the contest between the two squads last year, with Harvard triumphing by a single goal. Sitting out of this game was dynamic attackman Aidan McLane’s older brother, senior attacker Devon McLane, who, similarly to his brother, put up a decisive six points in the form of four goals and two assists in the 2022 matchup.
The Crimson had its most energetic start so far, with sophomore FOGO Andrew DeGennaro winning the faceoff and shifting possession down to the attack, where sophomore middie Owen Gaffney took advantage of the substitution game to snipe a cross-crease pass to senior attacker Hayden Cheek, who slipped into space amidst the chaos. After losing the second faceoff, Harvard showed its physicality and size on the defensive end, getting on the hands of the Brown attackers, holding them scoreless while running down the clock.
On the offensive end, the Crimson attack proved much more decisive, utilizing every inch of space the Brown defenders gave up. The attack settled down quickly and played with a maturity it lacked in previous matchups this season. The young team was able to capitalize when it needed to, overcoming nerves in critical moments. Malone’s goal to send the team into overtime was a prime example of this.
“We worked on zone all week because we anticipated that we were going to get zoned, and I think that we just took smart shots, moved the ball well, made smart decisions, got everyone involved, and I think that was the reason for our success today,” Malone said.
Despite the win, the Crimson has areas to improve on before its game against Boston University on Tuesday. On the defensive side, one-on-one matchups was something that the team still needed to work on, and Brown was able to take advantage of this weakness in its sets.
“Coming into this game, we knew they were going to do a lot of inside action, and that they had a bunch of really talented guys. We saw that and we had to make on the fly adjustments to sliding to guys a little bit earlier, but overall we didn’t do the greatest job in our core principle of sliding and recovering,” said Muller. “We constantly had a two-on-one inside with both of our guys when x-cuts were coming because we were loosening up the slide which was needed, but we didn’t have a recovery in the right spot. So, it was nice to get the win - we got two stops when we needed them - but, overall we needed to do a little bit better.”
Those defensive stops were essential to the Crimson’s success in sudden death overtime. After Malone’s goal to tie the game with 13 seconds left in regular time, the clock expired, and so each team had time to regroup before a faceoff. Harvard lost this initial face off, and thus started overtime playing defense. Winning possession on the faceoff was, similar to the Michigan game, an area the team needed to improve on, as the Crimson only secured 35% of all takes.
Despite this, the defense was able to get the ball back. First-year SSDM Owen Guest stripped his attacker, and the Crimson defense was able to successfully clear the ball to the attacking end. Sophomore middie Owen Gaffney was the first Crimson offensive player to shoot in OT, with a rip from the outside. However, his shot was deflected by the goalie, and in the scrum for possession, the loose ball went out of bounds. The referees initially called the ball in favor of Harvard, granting the Crimson possession, but the call was overturned, and Brown was able to clear the ball from its defensive endline, forcing Harvard to make a defensive stand one last time.
Brown dished the ball to McLane, and he fired off several takes that flew just high of the goal. His efforts weren’t enough to clinch the victory, and with about 45 seconds left on the clock, the Crimson used its final timeout to once again draw up a play to try and seal its victory. In a role reversal, Malone hit a flying King on the doorstep, and King was able to eek the ball past the goalie, sealing the win.
“I think we fought till the end. We went on some runs and they went on some runs, props to them they’re a great team, but our guys have no quit in them,” Loring praised. “I’m really proud of the way we played down the stretch and the way we capped it off.”
The closeness throughout the entire game proves how competitive the Ivy league has become.
“What made it dramatic was that we had the lead for pretty much the whole game until about two minutes left to go. We couldn’t shake them, and I think that’s a testament to Brown’s ability and how well they’re coached,” noted Byrne. “When you're in a game like that, that feels like a tennis match or a boxing match, it’s sometimes who can hit the winner or who can land the last punch, and we were fortunate to land the last punch.”
Going into the BU game, there is a lot that the Harvard team will hope to improve on. Coach Byrne praised his team’s ability to better dissect a zone between the Michigan and Brown games, but had areas that he and the squad will hope to focus on this week.
“BU is super aggressive, super creative offensively, and I think we are going to take a lot of lessons on how to play unsettled defense, how to play one-on-one defense, and how to support, because we didn’t do very well with that today,” Coach Byrne stated.
While BU is an out-of-conference game, each contest exposes both highs and lows for the squad, and so the team will look to perform better and better with each game.
“I think that every game is going to be a dog fight, and with the Ivy League being super competitive, we have to really just play hard and play to the last whistle,” Muller said.
The Harvard Crimson take on the Boston University Terriers Tuesday at 7pm on Nickerson Field at BU. The game will be streamed on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, while many students returned to campus following spring break, the No. 6 Harvard men’s hockey team sat in their loss from the night before for almost six hours on a grueling bus ride back from Lake Placid, N.Y. The night before, the team fought to defend its Whitelaw Cup title as ECAC champions approximately 300 miles away from campus, ultimately falling short in a narrow 3-2 loss to the Colgate Raiders.
“I don't think we played our best and [we] ended up chasing the game against a team that really played well and made some key plays, made some key saves,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 commented. “As much as we really pushed in the second half of the game and had plenty of opportunities, chasing the game is never a great recipe to have success.”
Finishing second in the ECAC standings in the regular season with an 18-4-0 record and 49 conference points, the Crimson earned a bye in the first round of the tournament and home-ice advantage for the quarterfinals. The weekend of March 10, Harvard welcomed the Princeton Tigers to Bright-Landry Hockey Center for a three-game series.
In dominant fashion, the Crimson advanced to the semifinals in two games, winning both by a score of 6-1. Junior forward Alex Lafarierre recorded two multi-goal games, senior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson saved 65 of 67 shots on the weekend, and junior forward Sean Farrell reached a milestone of 50 points on the season.
After sweeping Princeton, Harvard headed north to Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., the site of the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” and the traditional host of the ECAC semifinals and championship game. The Crimson took on the No. 10 Cornell Big Red in Friday’s second semifinal, the game delayed over an hour and a half due to the Raiders’ double-overtime upset of the No. 2 Quinnipiac Bobcats.
The Harvard-Cornell matchup brought the best of men’s Ivy League hockey, with both teams shutting down their opposition’s usual dominant offense. Neither team found the twine in regulation, as Gibson posted 15 saves while Cornell goaltender Ian Shane rejected 20. It wasn’t until 4:28 into overtime that Laferriere closed things out. In a sequence of beautiful passing from first-year forward Joe Miller and senior forward and captain Baker Shore, Laferriere received the final feed and fired from the top of the left circle, triggering the final horn.
“I think it shows the versatility that we have as a team,” Farinacci said. “We can put up a lot of goals, but we can also win those close low scoring games that I think are super important at this time of the year.”
The Crimson returned to the ice for the final game of the tournament on Saturday against Colgate. Harvard entered the game seeking to defend its ECAC title, which it stole from conference favorite Quinnipiac last year in a dramatic 3-2 OT win. The Crimson were also riding a 9-0-1 game streak, its best run since 2016-17. The Raiders entered Saturday needing a victory to secure an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament, while also bearing responsibility for one of Harvard’s four conference losses of the campaign.
Colgate, having beaten the tournament’s top seeded Quinnipiac Bobcats the night before, continued their momentum, striking first and striking fast. Within the first minute of the game, Laferriere was called for interference. The Crimson’s penalty kill is usually one of the strongest in the country, ranked 17th in success percentage pre-game. However, it was unable to neutralize Colgate’s man-up advantage, as forward Colton Young found the top corner behind Gibson and put the Raiders up 1-0 just a minute into the game.
“We just weren't as sharp as we needed to be, [we had] a breakdown on their power play goal,” Donato said. “In a one game set, you need that combination of getting off to a good start, good special teams, and excellent goaltending. We're very aware of that and unfortunately, we didn't play well enough on Saturday in those areas.”
Colgate continued its dominance over the next 12 minute stretch, outshooting Harvard 15-7. The rush climaxed when Alex Young, brother of Colton, gained control of the puck in his own defensive zone, and took it coast to coast, getting the puck past Gibson and putting the Raiders up by two.
Following Alex Young’s goal, Harvard’s top line of sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, sophomore forward Zakary Karpa, and Farrell drew a hooking call, and the Crimson got a power play of its own. Despite putting up six shots, four on goal, Harvard was unable to cut into the deficit. The Crimson were given another opportunity just a minute later, as AlexYoung was called for interference, but the power play was cold again. In the minute of even-strength play remaining in the period, neither team added to the score, and Harvard was sent into the first intermission down two.
“We weren't the hungrier team early on in the game,” Donato observed. “That's something that we got to really make sure that we're focused on -– that we have a good start.”
The second period began with more of the same. The Raiders recorded five shots, four direct and saved by Gibson, in the first five minutes. After surviving Colgate’s first push, Harvard gained control of the puck and started a rush of its own. After a Laferriere shot was blocked by Ross Mitton, Miller picked up the deflection to the right of the goal, and sent it cross-ice to senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun. Thrun subsequently brought it to the top of the left circle, and shot. His wrister found the open space to the left of Raiders goalie Carter Gylander, the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player, and put the Crimson within a goal with 14 minutes left in the second.
After Harvard’s offense finally broke through, the Crimson continued the momentum. In the first rush after Thurn’s goal, Harvard held possession in its offensive zone and put up seven shots, of which the Raiders defense blocked five. Shot blocking was key to Colgate’s defensive success, as the Raiders got in the way of 36 Crimson shot attempts on the night.
After a Miller shot missed, the Raiders controlled possession and brought the puck to the opposite side of the rink. In a progression of quick passing, Nick Anderson attempted to pass the puck from behind the goal to Levi Glasman on the rush. Anderson’s pass went airborne, and Glasman’s stick caught the soaring puck, sending it into the goal before Gibson could track it across the crease’s airspace. Coach Donato challenged the play for a potential penalty, though the goal was upheld and the Raiders went up 3-1.
In the remaining ten minutes, the Crimson picked up its offensive aggression right where it left off before Glassman’s tally, outshooting Colgate 21-4, on goal 6-1. The Raiders’ defense blocked a whopping nine of the attempts, the remaining six missing wide, and the Crimson once again headed into intermission down two goals.
Harvard carried the recharged energy into the third, dominating both possession time and scoring chances. Coronato was slashed at 5:28 into the period, giving the Crimson another chance at a power play, but the unit again struggled to move the puck effectively. Continuing the aggression, in the rush following, Alex Young knocked Farrell down with his stick, and was sent to the box for hooking. On its fourth and final power play opportunity of the night, Harvard finally capitalized. Coronato finished a rebound from a shot by Farinacci, scoring his 22nd goal of the season to cut the lead to one with seven minutes remaining in regulation.
“It could have been easy for us to get frustrated and roll over there on that last powerplay,” Farinacci said. “We were able to stick with it and get a goal in a big spot with about seven minutes left.”
In the last seven minutes, the Crimson gave it all it had. The offense put up 20 shots, six saved by Gylander and eight blocked by the Raider defense. Gibson was pulled in favor of the extra skater with just over two minutes remaining. Despite a frantic final shift of the game, none of the Harvard attempts crossed the line, and as the buzzer sounded, the Colgate Raiders were named 2022-2023 ECAC Champions.
“I think we got off to a slow start, which I think hurt us in the end trying to play from behind against a team like Colgate,” Farinacci said. “They played really well- I give a lot of credit to them.”
However, the Crimson’s season doesn’t end here, as Harvard secured an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament on the back of its strong regular season performance.
“We have more to play for and bigger hopes and dreams here at the end of the year,” Farinacci commented. “[We’ve got] Friday to look forward to – it should be a lot of fun.”
The Crimson will take on the No. 8 Ohio State Buckeyes on Friday, March 24th at 2 pm at Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, CT.
