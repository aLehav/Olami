After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1968, shortly before his death, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. made a speech pondering his legacy. He reflected, “Every now and then I wonder what I want them to say.” It is human nature for an individual to ponder how he or she will be remembered after the earthly departure. Presidents want to be remembered for their achievements in office. Artists want to be remembered for their most discerning works. Many are content with being remembered simply for their devotion to family. What, then, of a unique historical figure like Reverend King, the American champion of civil disobedience?
King himself eloquently answered for us this very question. “If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness, and all of the shallow things will not matter.”
As we recognize the birthday of Reverend King again this year, it is crucial to look at the man from this perspective. While he may have died over 40 years ago, time has shown that the tempo kept by this visionary drum major has singularly transformed the fabric of American society. This accomplishment is indicative of the dynamic power of rallying an idea around an individual.
The official recognition of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day on the third Monday of January each year serves as an important reminder of the unmatched influence of certain individuals in changing the makeup of a nation. American culture loves its heroes, and every schoolchild is taught of the near-divine statuses of elected leaders like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Unlike these men, however, Martin Luther King, Jr. and the dream he proffered were not elected by a majority of American citizens. On the contrary, King had been fighting for the cause for many years before civil rights became (even tenuously) politically viable. While the reverend's dream was not called for by the American people, it was a necessary vision to address silent ailments festering below the surface of society.
This year, the celebration of the life and work of Reverend King fell on another important day, that of the second inaugural address of the nation’s first African American president. In his speech, President Obama alluded to King’s legacy, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, harking back, “to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.”
As long as there is a heterogeneous United States of America, there will be social ills that plague our interpersonal interactions. Yet there will also always be the lesson of freedom and equality handed down from our Founding Fathers. There are times when society will be reluctant to change, but there will persist the idea on which the diverse American fabric has been woven. Sometimes it takes an ordinary person to take up that idea and remind each and every one of us of its profound import. Such was the case with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the most instrumental drum majors this nation has ever seen.

I support the decision to bring former Mexican President Felipe Calderón as a fellow to the Harvard Kennedy School. The prestige of Harvard’s name will bring needed attention to a critically important country that has been totally missing from America’s national debate. However, the reasons cited by some Harvard professors for this decision are woefully misguided. Although Calderón showed courage in taking on the drug cartels immediately after his election in 2006, his decision to mobilize the military and the federal police and in effect “decapitate” the cartels by killing off their leaders was a disaster. His stubborn refusal to recognize that he had made a mistake cost the lives of thousands of innocent Mexicans. In addition, for people who live in extraordinary poverty in places like Ciudad Juárez, Calderón’s talk about improved health care and better economic opportunities is a fantasy.
On July 28, 2010, I made my first trip to Juárez as part of an ongoing project to write about the various humanitarian groups on the border. At that time Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world: In 2009, the city had the world’s highest murder rate. Stranded in the center of town at about 9 a.m., I watched as a federal police patrol of three dark blue pickup trucks repeatedly circled our area. With six heavily armed men in each truck, this was an intimidating show of force. Yet this approach obviously accomplished little when it came to identifying, arresting, and prosecuting those committing the murders and other violent crimes.
On subsequent visits, I would drive across at the Santa Teresa crossing on the west side of Juárez, nervously passing through one military checkpoint at the crossing and another one a few miles south. Again, the questions were clear: Why are all these soldiers out in the desert when the killings are taking place in the city? What skills do soldiers have in the policing process?
The questions concern much more than a misallocation of resources. One must wonder to what extent the federal police and the military became involved in the drug business and the killings themselves. Why is it that the homicide rate has dropped so dramatically with their departure?
Furthermore, there is the claim that Calderón improved health care. In these monthly trips to Juárez as well as small towns to its west, I’ve had the chance to visit orphanages, food banks, a privately run mental asylum, a Christmas gift program, a rehab center for young women involved in drugs and prostitution, a migrant labor camp for Mixteca Indians, and dozens of individual homes. These impoverished people might as well be on Mars because there are simply no adequate social services here for them. For example, in Guadalupe Victoria, a migrant worker camp with pools of foul water is less than a half-mile from the homes of the well-to-do farm owners. It would not be difficult for a government official to tell the farmers to provide clean drinking water to their workers. Yet Mixteca Indians come north from their home states of Oaxaca and Guerrero because conditions there are even worse. Their only salvation comes from humanitarian individuals and groups who have volunteered to help, often at great personal risk.
In terms of the economy and jobs, there are other Mixteca Indians trying to sell trinkets at the Santa Teresa crossing, young men offering to wash your car in Palomas, and men walking for hours along the Juárez-Chihuahua roadway picking up aluminum cans. But these are not real jobs. And the minimum wage is only about $4.32 a day, one third of the hourly living wage in Cambridge.
Given this lack of opportunity and alternatives, it is no wonder that young people, many of whom have been orphaned by or lost relatives to this violence, turn to gangs and cartels. What ever made Calderón believe that killing off cartel leaders wouldn’t simply lead to a bloody scramble to replace them? Why have the underlying social issues been ignored for so long?
These are American issues as well. It’s our money that buys the drugs, our guns that fuel the violence, and our political leadership that has shied away from addressing the immigration problem and the failed War on Drugs. Harvard can bring visibility to these issues, but only if Calderón's appointment is an honest dialogue and not just a defense of the “Calderón legacy.”
Morgan Smith '60, has been traveling to Mexico since his Harvard years. He now travels to Juárez and other border towns to assist and write about humanitarian programs.

It’s January, a month devoid of the $100 million franchise blockbusters that litter the screen in the summertime. For passionate moviegoers, Oscar buzz serves as a form of entertainment, as they desperately seek to see the films the esteemed Academy has named Best Picture candidates. It’s award season in Hollywood.
The annual television spectacle is set for February 24. This year, nine films are competing for the little gold man that took the permanent nickname “Oscar” in 1939, 10 years after the ceremony’s commencement in 1929. “Amour,” “Argo,” “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” “Django Unchained,” “Les Misérables,” “Life of Pi,” “Lincoln,” “Silver Linings Playbook,” and “Zero Dark Thirty” all stand for the category of Best Picture. That nine motion pictures can qualify for the prestigious award is a result of the 2010 expansion to include up to 10 films instead of five. However, the lack of a commensurate expansion in the Best Director category has lead to a failure to recognize the incredible achievements of the artists behind these masterpieces. Considering the rich cinematic history of the Oscars and the sheer talent of the coveted filmmakers that have walked the red carpet, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences must understand that a Best Picture nominee should correspond to a similar recognition of the director.
To create an Oscar-worthy film, a plethora of elements must fall perfectly in line to assemble the complete motion picture—an intricate puzzle. The writer must produce a screenplay that not only catches the eye of studio executives, but also brings together a cast and crew with a common vision for the screen. The actors must sweep the audience off their feet and provide a vicarious, two-hour experience in another world. The editor must combine these assorted scenes into a final product that masterfully adorns screens across the world.
However, it is the director that takes a story and turns it into an audio-visual experience. The director’s vision becomes the driving force that ultimately creates a celebrated and critically acclaimed work. It is the director’s perspective that takes the audience on a cinematic journey. It is the director that demands and facilitates the breathtaking performances from his actors. It is the director that transforms words on a page into a spectacle of aesthetics.   
To put it in perspective, imagine an author crafting an extraordinary book that not only finds its way to the top of The New York Times bestseller list, but also receives incredible reviews from critics. This same novel that captivated readers worldwide finds itself up for a Pulitzer along with nine other books. However, the author himself is not nominated for award consideration—just the book and, by extension, its publishers.
In a similar manner, the director is the one that puts this intricate puzzle together into a breathtaking film. He or she becomes the captain of the ship throughout the lengthy production process as 100 pages of script come to life. The director is not only the artist behind the film, but also the facilitator and enabler of its physical creation.
It is no secret that the expansion of the Best Picture category stems from primarily commercial concerns. The Academy Awards is a media spectacle that hosts millions of viewers across the world. Each year, the Dolby Theatre (formerly Kodak Theatre) is filled with enough star power to necessitate a pre-show red carpet special. As the human fascination with celebrities drives the ratings, the 2010 move to include more films up for Best Picture was reflected in an increase of five millions viewers from 2009.
This focus on commercializing the event threatens to snub the auteurs that make the marketing possible. For example, if “Argo” continues its current Best Picture winning streak, Ben Affleck could see his work celebrated without any personal recognition, let alone a congratulatory nomination for his accomplishment. Kathryn Bigelow has gone unnoticed for her thrilling adaptation of Osama bin Laden’s death in “Zero Dark Thirty.” In these visionaries’ places are the directors of smaller films like “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which, though beautiful and poetic, should not contend with the likes of Affleck and Bigelow.
The Academy must separate itself from its attempts to maximize its television ratings and reflect on the role it has had in shaping cinematic history. By ignoring the injustice it currently has in place and buying into the consumer aspects of a publicly televised award ceremony, the Academy Awards slowly becomes more like reality television. What would the Oscar for “The Godfather Part II” have been without director Francis Ford Coppola receiving a similar award? What about “Schindler’s List” and Steven Spielberg?
The time has come for the Academy to acknowledge the narrative voice of the director and its correlation with exemplary filmmaking. The artist must be tied to his work and awarded in a similar manner. With the two categories so lopsided each and every year, directors of front-running films will continue to go unrewarded for their work. It is time to right this injustice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had never known anyone to be killed before. That is, before last semester.
Earlier this fall, Harvard students got word on campus that Philip V. Streich ‘13 had died on his family’s farm in Wisconsin. Philip was the first person I ever knew from Harvard, as I had met him at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair four years ago. It was shocking to realize that someone so brilliant could be vulnerable to having a bright future cut short.
Then there was the December shooting at a shopping mall just miles away from my house in Oregon. I knew one of the two victims. Steve Forsyth was the stepfather of a childhood friend and an incredibly compassionate guy we are all heartbroken to have lost.
Finally, two days before Christmas, a boy from my high school graduating class, one of the kindest, most genuine people I’ve ever met, died in a car crash. Drake Edwards was just 20 years old when he and his friends were driving home from the mountain and suddenly lost control, swerving into oncoming traffic. He was the only passenger killed.
If tragedy comes in waves, this is one hell of a rip current, unforeseen by all.
This winter break, in addition to family time and Christmas carols, I’ve been spending a great deal of time reflecting on recent events. I haven’t even addressed the massacre in Newtown, which hit families across the America with a profound sadness. I am not going to breach the subjects of mental health or gun control or safe driving—there is a time and place for those topics, and this editorial is not one of them. This is about more than that.
I’ve struggled to extract the meaning from all of this hardship. To find the takeaway message for myself, who felt so inextricably connected to this web of tragedy. It would be easy to look at the lives of these men who died too young and say, “life is short, live while you can,” but this clichéd piece of advice fails to capture the solidarity that followed the heartbreak. More than anything, I am struck by one resounding message.
People are what matters. I suppose I may be biased as an anthropology concentrator, but these jarring reminders of the brevity of our lives have only helped to convince me that, politics, religion, and socioeconomic status aside, it is the connections we form with other people that define our experiences.
Listening to friends and family speak at Drake Edwards’ funeral in my hometown, I was overwhelmed by the compassion of the community around us. So many people from my high school had turned up to show their support in a tragic sort of class reunion where we all wore black instead of nametags. Yet as terrible as the circumstances were, the gathering was completely representative of Drake’s character. His smile, his laughter, and his love were infectious, and everyone who met him was affected by the fervency with which he lived his life.
What I respected most about Drake was that he made time for everyone, and ultimately I suppose that is the real takeaway from all of the sadness this season. Make time for people. Listen. We can have our groceries delivered to our door without even talking to a cashier, but is that really how we should live our lives? Are we really too “busy” to engage with others?
Recently, in a Powell’s Books restroom, a store employee’s actions pleasantly reminded me of the kindness of strangers. While I was tending to a wound on my foot the woman came up to me and offered to get me a Band-Aid, returning minutes later with a handful of plasters and ointment. “Foot trouble can just ruin your whole day,” she said with a smile before returning to work. I asked myself, would I have done the same for a stranger?
There is no excuse for not acknowledging those who have been significant in our lives and for not thanking those who have helped us along the way. For tuning into your Facebook instead of your nephew’s fascination with LEGOS. For not returning phone calls. For ignoring your cleaning lady. The smallest interactions can make the biggest difference, and we have no way of knowing our full impact on the lives of others. Drake’s funeral was testament to that.
I am no saint; I neglect my parents and have my fair share of grumpy days. It is easy to prioritize other things in the midst of midterms and financial crises. As we get older those distractions become still stronger, and it becomes even easier to keep to ourselves. But I try to remember that the fragility of our existence is all the more reason to cherish every day, to make the effort to connect with others. One of the speakers at Drake’s funeral said this of his life: “Rather than being counted in days, his was better measured in lives touched.” An admirable goal for us all.

There is a man in the rafters.
 
He is inching his way across a wooden joist, ten feet beneath a roof of corrugated metal and fifteen feet above a potential disaster. From below, he looks foreshortened and strange—large feet dangling, spindly arms clutching the beam, and, far above, a tiny head grimacing in concentration. He is focused on his task. We do not know what his task is.
 
“I can’t watch this.”
 
The crowd disperses beneath him. No one wants to watch the fall, but it doesn’t feel appropriate to look away either. He is sitting up now. A smile spreads across his face as he notices his audience. He waves.
 
I realize I am yelling at him to get down. There is a chorus of us now, disturbed by his stunt, frustrated but powerless, selfishly wishing we could keep dancing. We are angry hundreds and we are loud. For the first time tonight, the music has vocals; in spite of myself, I am grateful for the voices that break up the DJ’s monotony. 
 
Yet before we know it, the man is inching back—suspiciously more lithely than he did in his advance—and, grabbing onto a cement column, he swings to the floor. He is swept back into the anonymity of the mob that is more than happy to reclaim him on firm ground. We are glad to forget the man on the rafters, and how he made us afraid.
 
We don’t crave a good story as much as we used to. 
 
That’s why, two hours later, we are huddled in The Diner, knees awkwardly pressed together under a tiny banquette table. A few years ago, we would have been ashamed to leave a warehouse party in favor of fries; tonight, it strikes us as audaciously hilarious.
 
Our younger selves are scowling. Swapping a DJ for a diner doesn’t make for an impressive story. Everyone else is probably having a way cooler New Year. You’re embarrassing me.
 
We snicker into our scarves, happy to have escaped the cold and high school anxieties. We are content to watch the night happen. Outside, the wind transforms snow banks into whirling, seductive figures that crowd and beg at the windows. We don’t let them in.
 
“I wish I could have...a memory.” 
 
The words escape him before he knows what he means. It’s a ridiculous thing for him to say, but because it is so late—almost early, really—we let it slide. As I try to decipher his words, for no particular reason, I decide that I would like to hold on to this memory. 
 
I want to believe that I can make this night meaningful by choice.
I’ve read more than my share of articles written on twentysomethings—the latest of which seem to be motivated by Lena Dunham. Reading so many writers who look back on the sacred and formative mistakes of early adulthood feels a bit like cheating. I don’t want to be influenced by their mistakes. That said, I still can’t help but see glimmers of their missteps in my day-to-day life.
 
All this makes me feel awfully grounded. Like the only remedy is in the rafters.
 
When I think about the perspective that I lack, I want to be the man sitting on his beam and waving; I wonder what he saw. I want to know what the twentysomethings look like, and if we would seem convincingly confused and inspired for HBO.
 
I don’t know if our own mistakes are very cinematic. Maybe we shouldn’t have chosen the diner over the party.
 
But mostly I wonder if perspective from above would show me what will be worth telling. It’s not so much the story that I am looking for, but the memory that it will become. I wish I could have this memory now—where the fact that I hated the music, and that when he fumbled across the beams I turned away, both become trivial; the sole fact that we were twentysomethings will be enough. I think a little distance will make this story much more exciting than it really was.
 
When I eventually tell this story, I wonder what I will say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after Donald M. Berwick ’68 confirmed that he has been contemplating running for governor of Massachusetts in 2014, he said he plans to embark on a “listening tour” of the state in the coming weeks.
Berwick, a health care policy lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview with The Crimson that he will focus on learning about the state and about the concerns of Massachusetts voters.
“I have a lot of ideas about what I want to accomplish, but I also have a lot to learn,” Berwick said. “The exciting thing to be doing now is learning.”
Berwick returned to Massachusetts in Dec. 2011 after working under president Barack Obama as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Berwick said that he hopes to use his expertise in health care policy to improve all sectors of the Massachusetts health care system.
“We’ve got the potential for showing the country what world class success can look like across the board,” he said.
Should he run, Berwick would build on Massachusetts’s position as a leader in healthcare and education by tackling issues ranging from education to the environment to unemployment, he said.
During his 17-month tenure as administrator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented many of the provisions included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Obama signed into law in March 2010.
As administrator, Berwick drew opposition from conservatives for many of his proposals, such as the rationing of health care services to prevent rising costs. Berwick had also previously stated that an efficient health care system involved a redistribution of wealth, prompting further opposition from conservative critics.
Berwick entered office after Obama bypassed Senate approval for Berwick’s position and named him as a recess appointee in July 2010 before the Senate could schedule official confirmation hearings.
After Obama formally nominated Berwick for the post again in January 2011, a group of Republican senators wrote to the president demanding that he withdraw the nomination. Faced with such strong opposition to his confirmation, Berwick stepped down in December 2011.
Berwick, who said that he was “always interested in public policy and healthcare,” began his career as a pediatrician, graduating in 1972 from Harvard Medical School and Harvard Kennedy School. In 1991, he went on to become a co-founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit that, according to Berwick, aims “to improve healthcare all over the world.”
In 1990s, he also helped reform Britain’s National Health Service and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for his efforts.
If Berwick decides to run, he will follow in the footsteps of Senator Elizabeth Warren—another Harvard professor who returned after a brief stint in Washington to run for office in Massachusetts. Berwick said that Warren’s victory has proved that a candidate who has spent most of his or her career outside of politics can succeed in the political arena.
Only one candidate for the governorship, Joseph Avellone—a fellow Medical School alumnus—has officially thrown his hat in the ring. Avellone, health care executive and former Wellesley, Mass., selectman, announced his candidacy to the Boston Globe on Jan. 8.
Other potential candidates include Michael E. Capuano, a congressman in the Seventh District, and Steven Grossman, the state treasurer.

The so-called Kogan Chang Ma Trio—a group of three friends at Harvard who went on to become some of the College’s most famous musical alumni—reunited Tuesday afternoon in the Kirkland House Junior Common Room for an installment of the Office for the Arts’s Learning from Performers program.
Cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, pianist Richard Kogan ’77, and violinist Lynn Chang ’75 performed briefly for the nearly full room and proceeded to discuss their time at Harvard, how their paths diverged after graduation, and how students involved in the arts can further those interests.
Chang said that as undergraduates, he and his two friends “had all the same questions that many of you are asking.”
The event began with the performance of part of Ludwig Van Beethoven’s short piece “Before I Work, I Must Eat.” Chang joked that for the trio’s performance, a more relevant title might have been “Before We Speak, We Must Play.”
OFA director Jack C. Megan said that the impetus for the event was a conversation that Ma, Kogan, and Chang had at Chang’s daughter’s wedding about how each of their careers had developed to include activities other than performance.
In 1998, Ma founded the Silk Road Project, an artistic and educational organization dedicated to the cultural history of the ancient Silk Road.
Kogan, a concert pianist who also attended Harvard Medical School, has become a prominent psychiatrist known for lecturing on the relationship between music and medicine.
Lynn, a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, holds faculty positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Boston Conservatory, and the New England Conservatory.
“There are so many wonderful ways to live life in the arts,” Megan said. “I was dying to bring that conversation here.”
Each of the performers spoke about their time at the College, at times poking fun of each other and drawing repeated laughs from the crowd.
Kogan said that he did not enjoy practice as an undergraduate, calling his relationship with music at the time a “kind of a shotgun marriage.” Still, he recalled being inspired to see about 30 of his neighbors in Hurlbut attend one of his concerts with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
“Seeing how excited they were about music was a thrill for me,” Kogan said.
Ma said that working with Kogan and Chang taught him how to solve problems as a group, though they “teased me incessantly.”
All three men declared that students interested in the arts should not be afraid to create unconventional paths for themselves.
“I think it’s normal to feel conflict, and I think it’s also okay to not have all the answers,” Ma said. “It’s always going to be not what you expected.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Addressing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of supporters lining the National Mall, President Barack Obama laid out a bold progressive agenda for his final four years in office. Once criticized by liberal supporters at Harvard and beyond for dragging his feet on liberal causes, Obama received praise for his speech from left-leaning activists at Harvard and beyond and, some said, rejuvenated hope in his progressive bona fides.
“I thought it was great, the civil rights agenda that he outlined, he touched on gay rights, immigrant rights...At this point, they’re not even political issues, they’re things that have to get done,” said Julia B. Konrad ’13, who served as vice president of Harvard’s Institute of Politics this past year. “People are over a lot of radical Republicanism.”
Obama’s repeated references to gay rights were among a diverse array of statements in the speech that suggested an increased commitment to a wide array of progressive causes. Running at just under 20 minutes in length, Obama’s speech promised action on climate change, reform in immigration policy, and improvements to social welfare programs.
Portions of the crowd erupted in applause at many of Obama’s references to these issues. At other points, attendees broke out in tears.
“It seemed like he was coming to terms for what he stood for,” said Faith A. Jackson ’16. “It was interesting to see him talk about things not just in theory but how they were applied.”
Jackson, who served as a volunteer for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren during the 2012 election, said that the speech helped emphasize that change is a slow process that would continue throughout Obama’s second term.
“America is just one big ship that takes time [to turn] before you actually start moving in a new direction,” Jackson said. “Everything takes time...We’re not stalling.”
At times, Obama used his speech as a call to action, telling the audience that change could be achieved with broad civic commitment across the political spectrum.
Whether enthusiasm over the speech will translate into broad support for Obama’s positions on politically divisive issues remains to be seen, but several Harvard students who attended the inauguration said they would likely continue to work to advance Obama’s causes.
For other Harvard students, the swearing-in ceremony and the address that followed represented a moment devoid of partisanship and an opportunity to witness a highlight of American politics.
“It’s [an] example of the greatness of the American political process,” said Benjamin Y. Zhou ’15. “It’s such a spectacle seeing everything come together.”

Harvard Square’s Upper Crust Pizzeria, which closed in the wake of a company-wide legal scandal last November, will reopen as the renamed and partially worker-owned The Just Crust, ushering in a new era for employees of the embattled chain.
Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, who represented Upper Crust employees in a labor abuse case against the management, spearheaded a fundraising effort to purchase the Harvard Square location when the pizza chain’s ten leases were auctioned off in December 2012.
“It’s an exciting new way of supporting the workers we represent,” Liss-Riordan said. “I’m really hoping that we can make a success of it because I’m hoping this can serve as a model.”
In 2009, the Department of Labor mandated the company to pay approximately $340,000 to a number of workers who claimed they were not paid overtime. Liss-Riordan, who is also a graduate of Harvard Law School, filed a lawsuit against The Upper Crust in July 2010, shortly after founder Jordan Tobins allegedly demanded that the employees pay back their overtime wages in order to keep their jobs.
The case was eventually granted class-action status in July 2012, allowing Liss-Riordan to represent all of the aggrieved workers. When The Upper Crust filed for bankruptcy in October and the company closed its 10 storefronts, Liss-Riordan started thinking about a way to reopen the restaurants and further help the employees she had represented.
Haluk Ozek, owner of Monella Boutique on Brattle Street, partnered with Liss-Riordan to purchase the pizzeria at the auction. He said he immediately loved Liss-Riordan’s idea of giving ownership shares to the employees.
“Because we’re a small business, we understand protecting the rights of workers,” Olek said. Ozek added that the new restaurant will focus more on providing superior food and service than on merely turning a profit.
As a Harvard graduate and former resident of Brattle Street, Liss-Riordan said she hopes The Just Crust will be popular among students and become an important part of the Harvard community.
“We are really, really excited about making this a great restaurant,” she said. “We’re hoping the Harvard community will be supportive of what we are doing there.”
Liss-Riordan said she hopes for The Just Crust to open by March. She said she is also still involved in potentially acquiring other former Upper Crust locations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Harvard students descended on the nation’s capital this past weekend for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, braving freezing temperatures for the swearing-in ceremony, waiting in lines that wrapped around city corners for the inaugural balls, and pushing through thousands of people to witness the inaugural parade.
Despite a crowd that early estimates placed at close to a million people in size, Harvard students still managed find each other among the masses.
Katie G. Walsh ’14, who attended the group with several friends from Harvard, said that while waiting in line for the swearing-in ceremony she turned around only to see another Harvard student who, like her, is involved in the Institute of Politics.
Julia B. Konrad ’13 said that although she worked in Washington this past summer, a large part of what prompted her to attend the inauguration were her political experiences at Harvard, where she formerly served as vice president of the IOP and was active in the Harvard Democrats.
The 2012 campaign, which resulted in the election of a U.S. president that she felt strongly about, was the first that she felt very much a part of, Konrad said.
“I think a lot of that came from the IOP and the Harvard Democrats and being around other Harvard students,” said Konrad. “For me, my Harvard experience is very wrapped up in my political experiences and my campaign experiences.”
Konrad watched the swearing-in ceremony from a location close to the Washington Monument, at the very end of a crowd that stretched from the steps of the Capitol building. Although the ceremony went by generally without a hitch, only minutes into Obama’s inaugural address, the Jumbotron near Konrad and her group of Harvard friends broke.
Despite the technical difficulties and the distance, Konrad said she thought the amped-up atmosphere of Washington D.C. during inauguration weekend was excitement enough.
“It’s very, very rare that you have so many people gathered in one place with so much energy and enthusiasm about our political future,” Konrad said.
For many students, the highlight of inauguration weekend was Obama’s inaugural address, a nearly 20-minute speech that throughout prompted approving cries from onlookers and by its end left more than a few audience members teary-eyed.
Charles A. Hobbs ’13, who attended both of Obama’s inaugural ceremonies, said he thought this year’s address was “a different type of speech” than the one the president gave in 2009.
“I was excited to hear the president come out strong on issues like equal rights for gays and lesbians and climate change,” Hobbs said.
“Certainly these are issues that I believe are important for our country... and it was exciting for me to see that they aren’t things that he’s given up on in his second term.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Personal trainer Kerry Antunes encouraged Harvard students to find time for exercise in their hectic schedules during a presentation on physical fitness Wednesday.
“What I try to suggest in the talk is that the gym isn’t so scary,” said Antunes, who works at Hemenway Gymnasium. “It can be realistic and it’s a way of life. If you start doing it now you won’t face a lot of things that a lot of older people are facing now like diabetes or high blood pressure or cholesterol.”
The talk, which was attended by a mix of College and graduate school students, is part of a larger effort by the University to promote consistent fitness and nutrition through a series of events run during Wintersession.
During Wednesday’s talk, Antunes advocated finding enjoyable and accessible exercise routines as well as being practical about what is doable given the many commitments of Harvard students.
“Being realistic,” Antunes said. “I think that the biggest thing is being realistic and knowing what you like and finding something you like.”
Antunes emphasized accountability in one’s exercise regime, encouraging students to find a workout buddy and use applications like myfitnesspal.com, a website and phone application that allows users to track their caloric intakes and workout schedules.
Despite the cold weather and hectic schedules, Harvard students still should strive to achieve the basic health and mental benefits of exercise laid out in the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for physical activity, Antunes said. The ACSM suggests 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise five times a week.
Antunes tried to change the image of the gym as a scary place during her talk.
“You think people are staring at you but they’re not,” Antunes said. “They’re always staring at themselves.”
She outlined the multitude of exercise options offered by the University at low to no cost, such as fee-based personal training sessions and free group exercise classes.
Despite all the bells and whistles of Harvard recreation, Antunes recommended that one’s basic routine be based on the concept “keep it simple, stupid.” She described a sample total body workout that a student could ideally perform twice a week anywhere, from the gym to the dorm room.
Jonne K. Saleva ’16, who attended the event, said he was impressed by the many exercise opportunities discussed by Anunes and that he plans to try them out over the coming semester.
“I knew that there’s a lot of stuff going on at Harvard but I wanted to see it explicitly on a PowerPoint slide because I already work out [and] I just wanted to see the other opportunities that are available,” Saleva said. “I’ve read about this stuff before, but it’s always good to reiterate it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One official’s arm went up. Then another’s. In the blink of an eye, the Harvard men’s hockey team faced a two-minute 5-on-3 penalty kill midway through the final frame of a one-goal game at Union College.
The Dutchmen power play unit capitalized for the second time on the night to open up a two-goal advantage. No. 19 Union (12-8-4, 6-4-3 ECAC) would strike twice more in the final 12 minutes as the Crimson (5-11-1, 3-9-0 ECAC) lost its fourth straight, 4-1.
Down 1-0 with 12:24 remaining in the third period, Harvard was whistled for two minors as senior forward Marshall Everson went to the box for hooking and classmate Luke Greiner joined him for high sticking.
“It was really weird,” senior forward Alex Fallstrom said of the simultaneous penalties. “It kind of came as a surprise to me because I didn’t really see what happened, but it was unfortunate and really hurt us in the game.”
Union quickly capitalized on the opportunity, winning the next faceoff in Harvard’s zone and looping fifteen passes around the three Crimson defenders before senior forward Wayne Simpson tapped one in from close range to put the home team up by a pair.
“[Union] moved the puck well and obviously took advantage of that five-on-three,” Fallstrom said. “That was the turning point of the game.”
The Dutchman forecheck pressured Harvard from start to finish. Union directed more shots on net than the Crimson in each period for an overall advantage of 38 to 23.
The two teams remained scoreless after the first period as Harvard failed to convert on its only two power plays of the night. But the Crimson defense only yielded a few early opportunities to the Dutchmen.
“We started out more structured overall, which helped me a lot in the defensive zone,” said junior Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard, who had 34 saves on the night.
“I think we were really playing sound defensively for the first 40 minutes or so,” Fallstrom added.
With less than four minutes remaining in the second, sophomore forward Max Novak put Union on the score sheet after a holding minor on Harvard forward Ryan McGregor provided the Dutchmen their third power play of the night. Union junior defender Mat Bodie fed the puck to Novak, who slung a shot from the top of the slot past a screen by freshman linemate Matt Wilkins.
“Starting in the second period, we took many penalties that ended up being momentum changers and allowed [Union] to spend a lot of time in our zone,” Girard said. “They got some scoring chances off of that and capitalized at the right moment.”
In the final frame, Harvard managed to kill the remainder of the Union power play following Simpson’s goal.
Less than two minutes after the Crimson returned to full strength, a rare icing from the Dutchmen provided Harvard one of its few chances of the night.
Center Collin Blackwell won the faceoff to Jimmy Vesey, who launched a wrister inside the circle before Union goalie Troy Grosenick could locate the puck.
“The line with Jimmy Vesey, Brian Hart and Colin Blackwell always brings a lot of energy,” Fallstrom said. “I thought they were good tonight.
The goal gave Harvard new life, but only momentarily.
Union’s Matt Wilkins responded to Harvard’s strike less than three minutes later. A failed Crimson clear was intercepted by Bodie, who fed the puck to Wilkins for a long-range wrister that sailed past a screened Girard.
Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 pulled Girard for an extra attacker with less than two minutes left, but the move failed to spark a Crimson comeback. The Dutchmen added an insurance marker on an empty-net goal from Daniel Carr with 18 seconds left.
Tensions flared late in the game as officials issued Vesey a ten-minute game misconduct for a hit after the empty-netter. Freshman Union forward David Roy was sent to the box with two seconds remaining in the game for a slash.
The Crimson now sits on the 12th and last rung of the ECAC ladder as it prepares to host 11th-place St. Lawrence and 8th-place Clarkson this weekend. Ten more conference games remain on Harvard’s schedule.
“We went out and competed really hard,” Fallstrom said. “The puck just didn’t bounce our way today. We’re just going to have to reload and get back at it on Friday.”
