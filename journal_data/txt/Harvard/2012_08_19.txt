After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A magnificent display of 1,000 cupcakes with flavors like chocolate basil with strawberry buttercream and almond with earl grey buttercream wasn’t enough to crown Meghan Coleman and Gwen Rogers as winners of Food Network’s Cupcake Wars.
But these local pastry chefs from Crema Café walked away with something more valuable than the $10,000 winning prize: exposure to their baking panache.
“We have customers calling from all over the country asking if we ship cupcakes,” co-owner Marley Brush said. “Our cupcake sales have quadrupled since the show aired.”
Coleman and Rogers, who joined Crema Café a year ago, said they decided to apply to be on Cupcake Wars after seeing some contestants act unprofessionally on the show, “like wearing your hair down," Coleman said.
"You never do that in the kitchen,” she added.
Each week, Cupcake Wars features four teams of two bakers who compete in three elimination challenges until one is announced a winner.
Coleman said that being on the show was quite a challenge. Not only were the teams put under pressure while baking cupcakes in a fast-paced, timed environment, but they also had the production crew follow them everywhere as they ran around in a busy kitchen.
Although Coleman said it was disappointing to come in second place, she said it was a great learning experience because they received lots of feedback from the judges.
Crema Café will serve all four cupcakes featured on the show—from pistachio chiffon with rosewater buttercream and cardamom phyllo nests to peach with sweet corn and thyme buttercream—through the end of August.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Class of 2016 packs their bags to move to campus, some are packing one more item to the usual list of clothes, futons, and carpets.
Starting this fall, incoming freshmen will be able to donate their gently used college prep guides and test books to Cambridge Rindge and Latin through “Harvard Gives Back,” a charity initiative created by Madeleine H. Gearan '15.
“I hope that Harvard Gives Back can make a difference to some local high school students,” Gearan said. “I'd also like to think that it's a statement to Harvard students.”
Gearan developed the program last spring semester, as a final project for her freshman seminar, “Communications, Advocacy, and Public Affairs,” taught by Christine M. Heenan, the University’s vice president of public affairs and communications.
“I was really glad I took the class,” Gearan said. “Heenan was very helpful in terms of ideas and how to execute them.” Gearan took her plan to the Freshman Dean's Office.
“We were very excited about the project,” Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman '67 said. “It aligns with our interest in promoting concern for the well being of others.”
An email about Harvard Gives Back was sent Aug. 10 to the Class of 2016. Gearan said she has already received emails and Facebook messages from students looking to donate books.
“[The FDO] was very helpful in terms of thinking about the note to the incoming class and then actually making that happen,” Gearan said.
Other incoming freshmen expressed interest in the program.
“It's a worthwhile initiative to give back to the community,” Eddy A. Grafstein '16 said. “I'm going to bring a few [books] up.”
Gearan helped enact a similar program in her hometown of Geneva, NY, where freshmen at Hobart and William Smith Colleges can donate their used books. She said that she hoped to expand the program in future years and donate to other high schools in the Boston area.

N. Gregory Mankiw, Economics 10 professor and newly appointed chair of the economics department, could use a refresher on the appropriate citation of sources, according to Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman in a recent New York Times op-ed. Krugman writes that Mankiw, who is Romney’s lead economic advisor, misused sources in a position paper that he co-wrote with three other economists for the presidential candidate’s campaign.
Mankiw and co. referenced economist Amir Sufi's paper on the 2009 program “Cash for Clunkers” to demonstrate the negative effect of the Obama administration's stimulus policies. Sufi said to Ezra Klein of the Washington Post that his paper does not actually support this point.
 
“Most of the research is pretty positive on stimulus,” Sufi said to Klein, speaking broadly about research in the field.
 
Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post notes that there are 15 empirical studies on the effect of the stimulus. Twelve studies note a positive effect. However, these studies are absent from the Romney paper. Instead, the paper cites two studies: the “Cash for Clunkers” paper by Sufi and Atif Mian, which does not make Matthew’s list because it only surveys a small subprogram of the stimulus, and another paper by economist John Taylor, who co-authored the position paper and advises Romney.
 
Though Mankiw has not directly addressed these claims, co-author Taylor issued a response to Krugman's critique on August 13.
On Sunday, Krugman also called out noted Harvard historian, Niall Ferguson, for allegedly misrepresenting findings of a CBO report on Obama's Affordable Care Act in a cover story for Newsweek. Looks like it's time for everyone to go back to school.
