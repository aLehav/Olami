After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Writing about making a sweater from scratch is an intriguing premise, absent in the literary world — until now. A veteran writer, Peggy Orenstein may be best known for her New York Times-bestselling books “Girls & Sex” and “Boys & Sex,” though recently she made her foray into memoir-writing with her newest work, “Unraveling” — a piece that claims to “spin a yarn that will appeal to everyone.” With this more personal work, Orenstein explores the history, politics, and culture of the art of making clothes and how this intense process is woven into the very fabric of society. She spends portions of the book highlighting incredible women such as Lora Kinkade, a professional sheep-shearer, and Kristine Vejar, a Californian textile artist. Although the memoir is insightful and educational, it suffers by never deviating from Orenstein’s singular perspective.
The memoir takes place during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Orenstein decided to cope with quarantine by making a sweater from scratch — including shearing a sheep for wool. Through this process, Orenstein grapples with a wide variety of concerns, from dealing with environmental issues to navigating difficult family relationships and questioning what it means to be a woman in the modern world.
Orenstein’s insightful comments may lead readers to be more mindful when choosing which clothes to purchase and wear. Orenstein traces clothes to their sources, uncovering the journey of a piece of clothing before it lands in the hands of the consumer. In her own way, shearing a sheep is the beginning of this journey.
Orenstein writes as though chatting to a friend while explaining the intense process that it takes to create the yarn, the dyes, and design of her sweater. The effect is that of a conversational style that flows quickly and invites the reader into this sheep-shearing, yarn-making journey.
All throughout, she inserts historical anecdotes of influential women. These anecdotes include both fairy tales and historical accounts, ranging from Rumpelstiltskin and Queen Elizabeth I to the women of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. These romps through history and culture made “Unraveling” not only an entertaining read, but an educational one as well. Including these cultural and historical sketches expanded the viewpoint of her narrative and brought honor to the work of women throughout all times and cultures.
Orenstein’s playful tone makes “Unraveling” a binge-able read. However, some of the same qualities that make “Unraveling” so lovable may also cause Orenstein to lose readers’ trust. Her attempts to relate to readers by assuming that they have the same worldview as her make the book’s writing feel less approachable.
Orenstein portrays a level of self-awareness at times, noting that she “came of age in the wake of second-wave feminism, a time when girls like me (white, educated, financially comfortable) measured our worth through personal ambition and professional achievement.” By including this comment, she shares valuable insight into the place from which she is writing. However, those who do not share the same upbringing may feel disconnected from her worldview and therefore may also feel disconnected from her humor.
As such, the frequent use of second person intended to draw in readers instead alienate them. Instead of respecting Orenstein’s arguments, readers may find themselves arguing with the premises presented.
Orenstein’s striving to find connection with figures in history also falls flat. In one instance, Orenstein describes a group of craftswomen who destroyed spinning jennies, a once revolutionary technology that replaced crafts women's labor. Orenstein writes, “as a person whose profession has been devastated by the digital revolution, I can relate.” But with a viral Ted Talk and articles published in The New York Times and The Atlantic, her accolades and popularity build a rather asymmetrical comparison to these historical women.
It can be appreciated that this is intended to be a humorous book. However, many of the jokes came at the expense of other people. Orenstein is heralded for her humor, yet her comments often fail to land, instead feeling tone-deaf and even immature.
Near the end of the book, Orenstein reflects, “I do believe that change starts with personal reflection, followed by connection with like-minded others, and, finally, engagement in repeated, targeted collective action.” These words are fitting for her memoir. “Unraveling” will serve those “like-minded others,” but may also fail to strike a chord with those outside of this demographic.

A dentist turned medicinal laser enthusiast, a natural-supplement alchemist, a Mormon “health retreat” founder, a Polish leech aficionado, devout prayer healers, and a man convinced that he is part alien — these curious but real characters help comprise the cast of Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling’s newest book, “If It Sounds Like a Quack…: A Journey to the Fringes of American Medicine.”
While the personalities mentioned in Hongoltz-Hetling’s non-fiction work may sound outrageous, they set the stage for an examination of a preposterous yet very real danger to American healthcare — quack medicine. Oscillating between poking fun at these eccentrics’ unorthodox techniques and lauding their beliefs, Hongoltz-Hetling also unleashes a torrent of criticism against government agencies, medical research, and institutional science efforts that blur the book’s motive beyond recognition. Ultimately, “If It Sounds Like a Quack…” clumsily skirts the line between comedy and effective social commentary, as the often rambling narrative fails to present real solutions to the core crisis that Hongoltz-Hetling identifies.
The very organization of the piece lends itself to comedic delivery with streamlined stories and fast-paced snippets. Separating the dubious actors’ narratives into chunks like the acts of a stage play, and introducing chapters with Shakespearean quotations, Hongoltz-Hetling assumes the role of playwright in his grand pseudo-scientific melodrama. By chronicling the healers’ lives both before and after finding a calling to alternative medicine, Hongoltz-Hetling allows readers to sympathize with the pre-quack life experiences that drove these people to devote themselves to their respective medical cures.
For Alicja Kolyszko, leech-facilitated bloodletting is the long-sought panacea. For Jim Humble, a chemical solution consisting mainly of industrial-strength bleach serves as the ultimate antidote. For Larry Lytle, a glorified laser-pointer acts as the ideal medical device. For each of these alternative-medicine advocates, the desire to spread their unorthodox treatments becomes an all-consuming passion. Readers are introduced to characters on a spectrum ranging from charmingly eccentric to downright deranged, and in doing so, Hongoltz-Hetling sets up his heroes for battle against their biggest fears — science, federal regulation, and worst of all, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
A portion of his subjects’ annoyance with the FDA seems to have rubbed off on Hongoltz-Hetling himself, as he describes the “wretchedly boring and impersonal FDA culture,” repeatedly quoting from their “567-page ‘Investigations Operations Manual’.” The book also repeatedly generalizes the work of scientists and statisticians as “the supremacy of Numbers Junkies, who have spent the last 170 years promoting data-driven approaches to medicine.” Unfortunately, Hongoltz-Hetling’s characterization of the FDA appears to prioritize this joke for a quick laugh over effectively advocating for clinically-proven science.
That is not to say that criticism of the American medical system is inappropriate in a book that documents the various ways in which frauds are allowed to illegally treat desperately ill patients. In fact, cogent arguments that identify these governmental ineptitudes in preventing the proliferation of quack medicine would have been essential in making this book a worthwhile addition to the discussion surrounding American medicine. However, Hongoltz-Hetling’s use of an excessively ironic tone only serves to detract from the serious issues that this book presents.
Hongoltz-Hetling’s irreverent mockery takes the spotlight in his grand finale, a curtain call where he documents the roles each leading quack played in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic under the Trump administration. Hongoltz-Hetling repeatedly refuses to identify Donald Trump by name. In one biting line he writes, “On January 22, 2020, the former game show host turned American president took a break from an economic summit in Switzerland to sit down with Joe Kernan, a journalist with CNBC.” Using statistical evidence and data, Hongoltz-Hetling links botched press releases and negligent tweets to an uptick in reckless self-treatments and quack medicine as well as COVID cases. However, these substantive arguments are cheapened the moment Hongoltz-Hetling stoops to name calling rather than relying on his curated evidence.
Appearing insensitive to the horrific exploitation of critically-ill patients and families, much of the book takes a jarringly light-hearted tone. One of the most upsetting moments of the narrative describes the death of Kara Neumann, the young daughter of two spiritual healers who succumbed to diabetic ketoacidosis as a direct result of her family’s refusal of all modern medicine. Ultimately, “If It Sounds Like a Quack…” fails to fully emphasize her death among other innocent lives lost or irrevocably destroyed as the true cost of predatory fringe medicine.
Between health retreats, leech blackmarket schemes, and anti-hospital churches, this book depicts the alternative medicine personas that act as the foundation for America’s pseudoscientific infrastructure. Yet the human impact of quack medicine reaches beyond the sensational and laughable façade that this book unfortunately portrays to readers. In the end, these victims suffer the true cost of pseudoscience. Their lives and their stories cannot be reduced to mere punchlines.

Stumbling into the detective world isn’t as easy as these inexperienced amateurs expected it to be. Directed by Jeremy Garlick, “Murder Mystery 2” picks up the story of the Spitz family — Nick (Adam Sandler) and Audrey (Jennifer Aniston), husband and wife — right where the first film of the series left off. After the couple’s success solving the case in “Murder Mystery,” the dynamic duo decided to open a detective business of their own and are desperate for customers. Much to their surprise, the Spitz family might be getting a miracle much sooner than they had imagined.
Vikram the Maharajah (Adeel Akhtar), an old friend of the couple, is getting married and the Spitz family are invited to his private island for a celebration. Once arriving to this decadent island, they look noticeably out of place — their wardrobes don’t match the extravagance of the ceremony and they lack the general “manners” that many of the other guests have. These discrepancies are cemented through a strange dance scene during the wedding reception ceremony that paints them as a target and builds suspicion among other characters before the crime has been committed. In the moment, the groom was supposed to appear at the ceremony, it is revealed that he has been captured by kidnappers who wish to exchange his safety for 70 million dollars at the Arc de Triomphe, suddenly shifting the film’s setting to the Paris, and launching viewers into the mystery of predicting who could have possibly committed such a heinous offense.
Straight out of the gate, the movie feels incredibly formulaic, playing Old Navy-esque beachy music at any chance it gets. For a murder mystery plot that relies on eccentric plot twists, it is surprisingly predictable, following much of the structure of the first film. Admittedly though, the sets are stunning and the movie is overall visually appealing. What stands out in particular is the wedding reception scene’s beautiful wardrobes, bright ranging colors, and pink lighting that imbues the ceremony with an aura of mysticism. However, this does not redeem the film. It’s simply a sign that the film focuses on safe design elements instead of taking any risks that could differentiate it. Although it is unexpected from Adam Sandler’s infamous “Happy Madison Productions” to be anything but ordinary, this film does not try to break out of the Hollywood mold, resulting in something that is very visually action packed, yet somewhat boring.
While “Murder Mystery 2” adheres to the distinctive Sandler humor, it, surprisingly, does not resonate with many audience members. Male characters continuously hit on Audrey throughout the film in a way that provokes Nick to be overly protective, before he turns around and flirts with women in a much more ill-intentioned way. Additionally, there is an absurd amount of potty humor present that just doesn't land. Although these jokes are seemingly harmless, they are dull and flat, resulting in a film that falls short of providing the comedy it promises.
The movie's main scene of redemption comes in France, when the Spitz’s attempt a hostage exchange and are instead kidnapped themselves — becoming the first exciting scene, despite occurring halfway through the film. The Spitz’s are held at gunpoint as they are taken into a van, where a well executed fight scene occurs between the couple and their kidnappers. Despite the confines of the van, the Spitz’s find a variety of clever methods to dispose of the threat being posed by their abductors, ranging from hand to hand combat (with some extra blunt force in the form of a briefcase) to axe murder. Even the soundtrack improves in this scene, playing an uptempo yet noir French song that matches the setting perfectly.
Ultimately, the movie tries to subvert the narrative tropes of a typical murder mystery genre in a similar way to “Knives Out.” But rather than being clever and using the cliches for plot advancement, the film acknowledges these tropes through humor and comedy that doesn’t quite land. Although there is no denying the film’s faults, viewing the film with these in mind can still allow for an enjoyable viewing experience.

Joseph Earl Thomas’s debut memoir, “Sink,” is a lesson in style. His lightly experimental yet always acute prose takes readers through his childhood and adolescence in Philadelphia, ever-surrounded by varying levels of hostility and indifference in his home and at school. Thomas carefully crafts vignettes, full of intense awareness and capacious emotion. His writing follows a singular stream-of-consciousness style that is almost like prose poetry at times, yet always culminates in a sharp, cogent bit of insight — which lends the book its astonishing quality.
Young Joey lives with his grandparents and younger sister Mika in Philadelphia, with various other family members, including his mother, coming in and out of the picture. Adults are confusing to Joey, by turns abusive and neglectful, yet he, observant and astute, notices the patterns of harm that might lead them to behave in such a way towards him. He is curious, sensitive, loves animals and video games, and is continually pushed by his grandfather to be more masculine.
Readers follow the author’s younger self, Joey, through his journeys in the third person, yet this perspective doesn’t keep the reader from accessing his internal consciousness. Unlike traditional memoirs, the writing mostly utilizes third person narration, giving readers a sense of Joey’s detachment from his own emotions, as if he is watching his childhood unfold from a detached perspective. The memoir includes many distressing accounts of Joey encountering situations that were far too adult for his age, from drugs to sex, and Thomas captures his youthful bewilderment through form and description beautifully.
Occasionally the memoir dips into second person during short interludes about specific video games. This stylistic break drastically contrasts the heart wrenching reality of Joey’s life with the traditional video games present in an unencumbered childhood.
“Will he simply grow up, come of age, and forget all about it in order to pen a more insightful story about the many nuances of Black joy despite his own subjective experience, overcoming individuality in the service of lifting every voice to singing?” Thomas writes. “Find out next time, on Dragon Ball Z.”
In this interlude, Thomas writes a self-conscious voiceover placing Joey as the hero of the game “Dragon Ball Z,” but the video games described range, including “Star Ocean: The Second Story,” or “Azure Dreams.” Video games, shows, and nerd culture are ways in which Thomas escaped from his hazardous world, and how he was able to understand it.
“Much like Sonic the Hedgehog,” Thomas writes, “Joey just knew that life would be about navigating the machinery of other people’s lust, greed, anger, or hurt, spinning signs and jumping high over the spikes, but not too high, skirting just under the sharp thingies on the ceiling, and most of all, being thankful that if all else failed, at least there was a roof.”
Violence and hostility are a given in Joey’s world, yet Thomas remains matter of fact in the presentation of his childhood, as Joey is in his interiority. Readers may find the work difficult to read at times, yet Thomas’s unassuming language allows for Joey’s rich internal world to remain the focus of the work. When Joey’s sister comes home crying after getting slapped by a boy, Joey spends three pages ruminating on their relationship and their places in the social world through an internal dialogue that all occurs while he tries to tie his shoelaces. Thomas wants to express love for his sister, but also doesn’t want to appear weak in front of his abusive father. These moments of deep awareness and consciousness, though often lengthy, are where the memoir is most clear and poignant.
In “Sink,” Thomas debuts a distinctive voice and a unique, impressive sense of style, unlike any other memoir. Though at times the level of detail reaches the point of feeling gratuitous, Thomas utilizes it adeptly to capture the consciousness of his younger self. Joey’s bewilderment and naïveté are hauntingly real, and Thomas has created a work full of candor and power that establishes him firmly among writers to watch today.

At the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge on Apr. 5, the Wicked Queer Film Festival premiered “The Good Manners,” (Dr. Santiago León Cuéllar), a Colombian Spanish-language film that beautifully explores the struggle of growing up, managing difficult family dynamics, and dealing with body confidence and insecurity.
The film is told from the perspective of seventeen-year-old Valerìa (Valeria Lopez), who is visiting her family’s farmhouse for her grandparents’ wedding anniversary. It is here where she deals with the judgment of her overbearing mother (Yanet Osorio), struggles with body insecurities, and reconnects with her sixteen-year-old cousin Sol (Valentina Noreña), who she has not seen in years. Her intermittent voiceover aptly lets the viewer into her head without redundantly stating her feelings. Though her poetic descriptions occasionally become overwrought, overall they contribute to the film’s moody, understated atmosphere, which is further supported by the minimalist, stripped-back soundtrack.
In fact, the film features gorgeous framing throughout, as Cuéllar creates stunning visuals that only enhance the narrative. The use of space whenever the characters venture into the countryside makes the actors look insignificant compared to the beautiful landscapes that surround them, underscoring how small and insecure the main characters feel. Similarly, there is a consistently effective use of unorthodox focus when characters interact: For example, while Valerìa pleads that they need to get back to work before their parents catch them playing around, the camera instead stays tight on Sol as she poses and tries on different hats, revealing both characters’ personalities and how they view themselves. In another scene, the camera stays tight on Valeria as she stews in her feelings while being berated by her mother for wearing a short dress, leaving her mother out of frame until after Valerìa exits the scene. This is a highly evocative technique, and supports the film’s plot light introspective structure.
Though rarely directly confronted, the exploration of Valerìa’s fraught relationship with her mother is done creatively and with nuance. This is best exemplified by a scene where Valerìa and her mother are getting dressed, and Valerìa wears an old dress of her mother’s that is clearly too big for her. Valerìa attempts to open up to her mother, but she makes Valerìa zip up her dress first, refusing to listen. Almost comically, the dress’s large sleeves repeatedly fall down throughout the scene, but Valerìa’s mother simply fixes it without acknowledging the obvious problem with the dress or her daughter’s desperation to be seen.
In this vein, there is perhaps an uncomfortable number of scenes of the teenage lead characters getting dressed and undressed. Though this motif contributes to ideas of how young people see themselves and present themselves to the world, especially when they feel uncomfortable in their own skin, within the first twenty minutes it already feels superfluous and overdone.
This is made clear in a scene where Valerìa asks to see and feel Sol’s tattoo, and in return Sol asks to touch Valerìa’s (almost invisible) scar on her abdomen, which has been a source of insecurity for her throughout the film. Despite being an impactful display of the complicated relationship between Valerìa and Sol, this also comes off as a bit coquettish, especially for Sol. Her character is consistently inscrutable. She vacillates inconsistently between acting considerately and selfishly towards Valerìa, rarely exhibiting any strong emotions.
Though the film is billed as a queer story featuring Valerìa’s “sexual awakening” after spending a week in close quarters with her cousin Sol, it is perhaps disingenuous to do so. The only queer connection in “The Good Manners” is an imagined, passionate kiss between cousins. And even then, this moment is more indicative of Valerìa’s desperate desire for connection and acceptance than any realization of lesbianism.
“The Good Manners” is a visually wonderful film, and is strongest when it luxuriates in the unsaid aspects of complicated familial relationships and the difficulty of growing up without a support system.

American rapper and producer Tyler Gregory Okonma, known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, released “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale” on March 31. The album is composed of all the tracks from his 2021 album, “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST,” plus an additional eight tracks that did not make it onto the original album. “The Estate Sale” acts as a post-album EP, continuing the themes and storylines of the original album. The return of DJ Drama’s iconic ad libs only add to the album’s powerful flow. Fans thought “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST” was a perfect album. With “The Estate Sale,” it gets better.
On the first track, “EVERYTHING MUST GO,” Tyler introduces the B-side of “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST” and thanks fans for their support during his most recent tour. “Thank you to every ear that listened, bought a ticket, whatever / Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.”
The next track, “STUNTMAN,” is like a shot of espresso. Featuring Vince Staples, the perfect combination of his and Tyler’s flow, DJ Drama’s signature shouting, and the classic Tyler synths in the mix force listeners to bop their heads. Lyrics like “No, you can’t be my girl, bitch, are you dumb?” add a chaotic and aggressive energy to the song which nicely contrasts the next track, “WHAT A DAY.”
“WHAT A DAY” has a calm, melodic feel to it, as Tyler subtly flexes his wealth and reflects on his goals and ambitions. He shouts out Black women, thanking those who raised him.
WANG$AP is reunited on “WHARF TALK” with A$AP Rocky’s feature. Tyler tweeted that this was his favorite track, and listeners might agree. Rocky’s flow works incredibly well over the beat, bringing a bright, summery energy to the song.
“DOGTOOTH” is a potential fan favorite, bringing together Tyler’s impeccable wordplay and hard-hitting consistency. The synths in the backtrack only elevate the catchy lyrical cadences of the song. And with lyrics like “​​ring, ring, ring, bitch, pick up the phone / I don’t care if y’all together, I will tear down a home,” Tyler ties back to the themes of infidelity from “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST.”
The next track, “HEAVEN TO ME,” opens with a sample from John Legend’s 2006 song “Heaven.” Tyler tenderly reflects on the trajectory of his life and career with lyrics like “[he] didn’t have much but for certain, [he] had a dream”, and now his life is “heaven 24/7.”
“BOYFRIEND, GIRLFRIEND” is listed as a 2020 demo and features rapper YG. The song is fun and unserious, as Tyler lets his humorous personality shine through with lines like, “Yeah-yeah-yeah, you got me stuck like glue / Yeah you got a girlfriend, shit, I’ll fuck her too, true.”
In the last track, “SORRY NOT SORRY,” Tyler is vulnerable. He apologizes for everything he thinks is wrong with him, while also recognizing the universality of the feelings of inadequacy. “Another era is upon us,” DJ Drama says at the end before shouting “We gone!” in the same way he did on “SAFARI,” the last track of “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST,” bringing the B-side full circle.
Overall, “CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale” is truly impressive. Not every artist can claim that even their leftovers are bangers, but Tyler, the Creator can. If Tyler sticks to his two-year album release schedule, then there’s a lot to be getting excited for sometime this summer.

This article contains major spoilers for Season 4 Episode 3 of Succession, as well as the entire series leading up to the episode.
Never trust an HBO wedding.
On Sunday, fans eagerly tuned in to “Connor’s Wedding,” the third episode of Season 4 of HBO’s “Succession” that seemed to promise hilarity and levity, as it covered the wedding of Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) doing what he does best — obsessively micromanaging obscene displays of wealth and generally making a big deal out of minutiae — in his extravagant yacht wedding with his fiancée Willa (Justine Lupe).
But after only 16 minutes of festivities, “Succession”’s latest episode screeches to a halt with a phone call. Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) informs the Roy siblings that their father Logan (Brian Cox) is now lying incapacitated on the floor of his private jet, receiving CPR as he flies to what was supposed to be his next critical business meeting.
The scene that follows is 27 minutes long, as the camera relentlessly captures the Roy siblings’ somber congregation on a private deck of Connor’s wedding yacht, listening to their father receive futile chest compressions through the limited signal of their cell phones, with an ocean and the sky between them. Long, uninterrupted shots follow the siblings, the camerawork imbued with “sadistically voyeuristic” movement, as executive producer and director Mark Mylod described in his post-episode interview. The camera doesn’t let the siblings off the hook, capturing every aspect of their grief-stricken reactions throughout this lengthy scene.
Attentive viewers of the show may appreciate the parallel between this scene and Logan’s Season 1 medical collapse on his private jet — except now he is surrounded by only Waystar Royco employees, rather than the family members he’s repeatedly pushed away since the show began. In one of many examples of the show’s excellent storyline planning, the writers deliver a clear message; had Logan not consistently deceived and betrayed his children, or even had he merely chosen to attend his eldest son’s wedding, he wouldn’t have died so mercilessly alone.
The acting in this episode is simply unparalleled. In one portion of the prolonged phone call scene, Tom holds his phone to Logan’s ear and instructs the Roy kids that these will be the last words they say to their father. In a series of raw, stumbling half-sentences, the siblings verbalize the dissonance that has plagued their relationships with their father throughout the series.
Roman (Kieran Culkin) stutters, “you’re gonna win, because you just win” followed by an unconvincing “Uh, you’re a good dad.” “I can’t forgive you. Um, but it’s ok. And I love you,” Kendall (Jeremy Strong) admits. “Don’t go please, not now,” Shiv (Sarah Snook) There’s no excuses but… it's ok Daddy. I love you.”
Their words serve as unpolished yet consummate summaries of the tragedy of the Roy family; they have simply hurt and been hurt by their father more than apologies or forgiveness could ever resolve, even in death. The delivery of these lines is what makes this tragedy so heart-wrenching, with Culkin, Strong, and Snook each remarkably displaying some of the best acting to come out of this already well-awarded show.
There is an overall somber sincerity to the entire episode, an honest portrayal of death that steers clear of the typical deathbed clichés that could never suit the ruthless Logan Roy. This restraint is what cements “Connor’s Wedding” in the hall of fame of modern television. The writers could have easily given us a series finale depiction of the Roy patriarch drawing his last breath at the end of this season. But death doesn’t follow a neat four-season arc, and “Succession” makes the commendable decision to give both the Roys and the viewer the realistic shock of an unexpected death.
We don’t even get to see Logan die, leaving a lingering sense of hope — or dread — that this could all be just another elaborate strategic ploy to manipulate the world to Logan’s bidding. It is not until the final shot of his tarp-covered body being carried off the private jet like cargo does the reality of Logan’s mortality truly set in. This decision to evade the definitive, to let the viewer and the characters linger in doubt until the last second, humanizes the Roys, letting the audience empathize with the billionaires as they’re reminded that immortality is the one thing even the wealthy cannot purchase.
Somehow, the show still deftly injects small moments of humor in the tragedy, for instance with the introduction of the phrase “Greglets” as Tom taunts Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) about his ability to be replaced. There are other resonant lines as well, such as a thought-provoking callback to Logan’s season premiere musings about people being merely economic markets, where Roman holds up a chart showing Waystar Royco’s newly tanking stock price and says, “There he is. That is Dad.” The skillfully-incorporated levity makes the tragedy feel almost more concrete; each fleeting Roman quip is met with the stark contrast of his solemn siblings, and accompanied grimly by his own tear-stained eyes.
Ultimately, this week’s episode of “Succession” will be remembered as the one where Chekhov’s gun went off. The obvious and yet impossible outcome, the outcome foreshadowed by the show’s own title, came true. Logan Roy finally died. With seven episodes remaining in the season, “Connor’s Wedding” has elevated the final season to new heights.

“Mafia Mamma” began with many of the typical ingredients that make for an entertaining film. It’s a campy comedy set in an exotic location with an appropriate sprinkling of violence. It stars an actress over 50 — a demographic wildly under-represented in this category — who is seeking to regain confidence at a point of inflection in her life. Not to mention the actress in question is Toni Collette, and with her at the helm, how could a film be anything less than entertaining? But director Catherine Hardwicke — best known as the director of the original “Twilight” — takes these ingredients and just throws them against a wall in hopes that something will stick, leaving the audience with a confused lead character, a multitude of intangible plot lines, and monotonous pacing.
The story begins with suburban mom Kristin (Toni Collette) seeing her son off to college. She’s the bread-winner of the family, working a high-level job at a pharmaceutical company while her husband is an aspiring musician. Soon after she discovers his marital infidelity, she receives a call from Italy with news of her estranged paternal grandfather’s death. Upon arrival, she is informed her grandfather was in fact a mafia Don and is calling upon her to take over the “family” business. Hijinks ensue, all of which seek to transform this downtrodden, workaholic mom into a confident, promiscuous mobster.
The film’s first major flaw is the lead character, Kristin, herself. She is introduced to the audience as a meek and overburdened mother — a role that Collette is less than believable in. Once she arrives in Italy, her friend instills in her the mantra of “Eat, Pray, F*ck,” which causes her to throw herself at every brooding Italian man she sees. But the leap between these two personas is jarring and unearned. The Kristin we see at home could never have made this transition, and yet, the audience is expected to believe a plane ride accomplishes it.
As the story progresses, Kristin does achieve her goals of being more confident, but it appears to come at the cost of her intelligence. This successful business woman becomes a bumbling idiot at the first sight of a man with sharp cheekbones. What does remain consistent about her character is her naïvity, which again comes into conflict with this metamorphosis we are to expect of her. Almost all her successes throughout the film come entirely as accidents, a humorous motif at first, but it fails to evolve to create a satisfying conclusion.
What makes this characterization of the leading role all the more disappointing is that it is portrayed by Toni Collette. Collette has starred as the caring single mom in “The Sixth Sense,” as the vapid Gwyneth Paltrow surrogate in “Knives Out,” and the intense and frightening matriarch in “Hereditary.” She clearly has range and the talent to excel at any role. But the inconsistent writing of her character does both herself and the film a massive disservice. She fails to be someone to root for, and her unpredictable actions make her all the more unlikeable.
Beyond the leading role, the overall plotline is confused and meandering. A template for an entertaining fish-out-of-water story is there, but the script refuses to follow it. The romantic plotline has no direction and begins with one of the least believable meet-cutes ever put to film. The role of the villain of the story transfers to different men with different manifestations of sexism every twenty minutes. And worst of all, the film continues for an extra half hour after the conclusion appears to have been reached, which is just one of many other examples where the not-so-funny film is improperly paced.
While it’s easy to root for the representation of an older female lead in a comedy film, sadly it’s hard to do in this case. “Mafia Mamma,” like many films, seems to have been built around a one-line pitch of phrases drawn from a random generator. “Suburban mom plus mafia Don” by itself may garner a chuckle, but without a genuine perspective, it falls short in every category.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since debuting in 2011, Apink has curated an expansive discography ranging across all K-pop genres. From their famous feel-good, bright pop tracks, including “NoNoNo,” “Mr. Chu,” and “Remember,” to their more recent renaissance with charismatic and bold experimental sounds, including “I’m So Sick,” “%%,” and “Dumhdurum,” Apink has done it all. Thus, when it was announced that Apink would be returning to the music scene with their 10th mini-album and first as a quintet — comprised of members Park Chorong, Yoon Bomi, Jeong Eunji, Kim Namjoo, and Oh Hayoung — many wondered what version of the group’s sound they would bring. On “SELF,” Apink returns to their roots and demonstrates their masterful execution of meaningful lyrics and powerhouse vocals asserting their status as K-pop legends.
Released on April 5, “SELF” is more than just Apink’s 10th mini album; it is an album that strives to be a “healing,” inspirational project with songs focusing on self-love and confidence.
The group set out to create an album that gives strength and healing to many people, member Yoon Bo-mi explained in an interview with South Korea’s The Single. Led by title track “D N D,” which stands for Do Not Disturb, Apink’s latest album contains five songs in total including, “Withcha,” “Me, Myself & I,” “Candy,” and “I want you to be happy.” Each song builds upon the previous to round out a solid, loveable album and deliver a message of comfort and encouragement.
The title track and first song, “D N D,” officially sets the tone of the album with a message of turning on the “do not disturb” sign and finding your own way through life. This comforting message is supported by refreshing instrumentals, which feature a funky bass punctuated by cheerful, bright chords emphasizing the addictive melody. The strengths of “D N D” lie in the final chorus and lyrics, which showcase the five members’ unique vocals, starting with leader Park Chorong’s sweet introduction to main vocalist Jeong Eunji’s incredible high notes, reminiscent of those in Apink’s debut song of “I Don’t Know.” While the track features entirely Korean lyrics, which sound beautiful especially in the native Korean language, some of the best lines include, “Don't disregard the dream you've put off / It's okay to be optimistic about tomorrow” and “I’ll always be with you / In the process of becoming an adult / It's okay to say that you're lost / Find your way.”
If “D N D” is the musical embodiment of dancing like there is no one watching, the second song of the album, “Withcha” is the smoother, R&B counterpart of confidently strutting down the street. With the repetition of “withcha”a spin on the phrase “with ya,” the lyrics build upon the idea of “finding your own way” that was introduced in “D N D” to bring Apink into the journey forward together with their fans. Although the melody is rhythmic, imitating a strutting pace, it can be a bit repetitive. However, the song both highlighted and benefitted from the youngest member, Oh Hayoung’s, suave vocal color.
“Me, Myself & I” is a ballad gem on the album, both vocally and lyrically. It features some of the best high notes, including those from lead vocalist Yoon Bomi, and skillful vocal phrasing, especially the final lines by member Kim Namjoo. It is a softer, but still feel-good ballad that makes listeners reflect on the ups and downs of the journey of self-love. Lyrics were written by Park Chorong, including themes of hate and love.
The fourth track on the album, “Candy,” brings listeners back to the groovier side of Apink. Just like its name, it’s a sweet song about giving and showing love because of the desire to make someone happy. This song features wicked synths, lyrics by Kim Namjoo, and even a surprise rap by the lyricist herself.
The final song, “I want you to be happy” is a tear-jerker and classic ending ballad. It is also Apink’s 11th anniversary fan song and lyrics were written together by all five members of Apink. The joint chorus of all five members is especially moving when they sing together, “Please trust me / I will stand right here without changing.” A wonderful ending to tie together a deeply reflective album encouraging listeners to reflect on their own personal journey as well as Apink’s journey over the years.
While at times the music and chords could be a bit repetitive, the strengths of “SELF” exist in its poetic, reflective lyrics and the impressive vocals delivering said lyrics. Apink should be proud of releasing a meaningful album like “SELF” that adds to their impressive, transformative discography. Longtime fans of Apink, also known as Pink Panda, will appreciate the album which serves as a love letter to Pink Pandas, fellow Apink members, and all those who are finding their own way everyday.

On April 4, the new movie trailer for “Barbie” dropped, and internet mayhem ensued. Starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the movie sets out to explore what happens when plastic children’s doll and global icon Barbie has an existential crisis and must leave Barbie Land. The film is written by Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the director of “Little Women” and both director and writer of “Lady Bird.” Gerwig is directing “Barbie” with Harvard graduate David J. Heyman ’83 and Margot Robbie as the primary producers.
Part of the excitement around the “Barbie” movie arises not only from the stellar cast, but also from the controversy surrounding Barbie herself. The plastic doll, created by Ruth Handler of Mattel, Inc., received great criticism after her release. Both feminists and conservatives disliked her for her oversexualized and unrealistic body, based on an eroticized German doll called Bild Lilli. Over time, more versions of Barbie have evolved to counter these objections. For instance, after her initial launch, Mattel added babysitting accessories for Barbie in order to make her appear more motherly. More recently, Barbies are available in “Petite,” “Athletic,” “Curvy,” and “Original” sizes with a variety of skin colors.
Barbie, like any insanely popular consumer good, can both cement cultural ideals and reflect their changes. However, Barbie is for children, not adult consumers. While some standards may help young girls, many certainly harm them. The most damaging consequences arise from the body expectations that Barbie reinforces.
According to Margo Maine, a clinical psychologist and founder of the National Eating Disorders Association, in her book “Body Wars: Making Peace with Women's Bodies (An Activist's Guide), ” Barbie would be 5’9”, wear a size three shoe size, and have 39”-18”-33” measurements. In the “Slumber Party Barbie” kit, she came with a bathroom scale permanently reading 110 lbs. “Babysitter Barbie,” on the other hand, carried a book called “How to Lose Weight.” Inside the book were the words: Don’t Eat. In fact, at her current weight and height, Barbie would have a body mass index of 16.2, making her severely underweight and likely anorexic.
Research by Developmental Psychology, a peer-reviewed academic journal, revealed that girls from ages three to eight who were given the “original Barbie” had lower self-esteem and more body image issues than girls who had no Barbie at all. While such expectations can fade with time when girls become women and realize that the Barbie body is entirely unrealistic and unattainable for anyone, those standards often imperceptibly linger.
Although Barbie can be seen as a feminist figure for young girls, her commercial success may be correlated with her thinness. In a study by Jennifer A. Harriger in 2010, preschool girls were presented with game pieces that were thin, average-weight, and fat to be their avatars in a game. The results reveal that there is a statistically significant preference for thin body types as young as the age of three.
Worse yet, the girls’ inclinations are not necessarily wrong. It is easier for women to succeed when they are thin. Jennifer Shinall, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt’s Law School, found that overweight and obese women are less likely to get personal interaction occupations, and even when they do, they are paid 5 percent less than their thinner female counterparts.
These painful statistics are not Barbie’s fault. Blaming her for America’s social problems would just be blaming another female figure for standards she did not create. Nevertheless, despite Mattel’s attempts to diversify body type and race within their dolls, Barbie still reflects and enforces those harmful ideals.
Perhaps what is more interesting than the development of Barbie over time is the evolution of women’s relationships with Barbie. According to the same study by Developmental Psychology, girls of older age groups tend to torture Barbie rather than play with her. Such aggression includes hitting Barbie against walls, decapitating her, and burning her in a “humorous” and “rebellious” manner.
Sometimes, this anger dissipates and Barbie is long forgotten. Other times, Barbie regains her position as a sexually forward fashion idol. The toy has more recently inspired a “Barbiecore” movement — celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Megan Fox, and Hailey Bieber have dressed in all pink to emulate the doll. The trend has gained popularity since photos from the “Barbie” movie have been released.
Many of the celebrities participating in the Barbiecore trend somewhat resemble Barbies: They are often thin, gorgeous, and white. However, the Barbiecore movement has also empowered people of different races, body types, and genders. Other celebrities have aimed to embody Barbie long before Margot Robbie’s role. Nicki Minaj, in particular, was the Barbiecore icon of the 2010s. Who can forget “Black Barbies,” “Barbie Tingz,” and the entire “The Pinkprint” album? In each song, Minaj celebrates her personal, professional, and sexual power with no submission or apology. She reclaims Barbie, and, as a result, redefines the meaning of Barbie — anyone can be Barbie, as long as they are confident, economically independent, and dressed in pink.
Gerwig’s new movie seems to strive for a similarly empowering message. Actresses like Issa Rae, Emma Macney, and Nicole Coughland play the president,a Nobel Prize winner in physics, and a diplomat respectively alongside Robbie as Barbie on screen. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also more than just the absurdly chiseled himbo; Simu Lu and Kinsley Ben Adir become Barbie’s boyfriend’s accessories, providing a more diverse representation of Ken besides the blond-haired, blue-eyed male doll. Even fans can partake in the excitement; anyone can visit www.barbieselfie.ai to photoshop themselves into the fantastic Barbie poster.
The trailer for “Barbie” seems to imply that more body diversity will be incorporated into Barbie Land: Although the trailer doesn’t indicate that cellulite will appear in Barbie Land, it does suggest that lacking cellulite does not make Barbie’s life satisfying or successful. Living in a perfect body in a perfect world does not mean that she is perfect, or perfectly happy. Why else would the plastic beauty leave Barbie Land in an “existential crisis?”
Robbie, who has recently played other blond, female characters on the big screen such as Harley Quinn and Tonya Harding, said in a 2020 interview with “The Hollywood Reporter” that the new Barbie was “the thing you didn’t know you wanted.”
Hopefully, the movie, which is set to release on July 21, will upend girls’ expectations and allow those who have grown up with Barbie to discover a more empowering purpose.

Lana Del Rey’s unique sound remains relevant as she weaves heartfelt ballads with upbeat indie pop in her latest album. Del Rey’s poetic sensibilities shine through as themes of Americana and heartbreak from her previous pop-centric albums return with a more nuanced consideration of family history and religious identity. The album’s well-produced acoustic soundscape elevates Del Rey’s melodies and lets her carefully crafted lyrics shine through.
The album’s deeply personal tone is immediately apparent from its first song, “The Grants.” In an ode to remembrance, Del Rey achingly sings about the things she wants to take with her, like her “sister’s first-born child” and her “grandmother’s last smile.” With a lilting voice accompanied by gentle harmonies, the refrain “I’m gonna take mine of you with me” draws attention to the album’s pensive, contemplative tone. This theme of remembrance ties together the tracks across the album.
In the single the album is titled after, “Did you know there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd,” this remembrance is accompanied by an irrefutable sense of loss. Even as Del Rey croons “don’t forget me,” the song is more introspective than anything. In a moment of incredibly poignant self-awareness, she asks the listener “love me until I love myself.” While she has sung about themes like nostalgia in a broader sense previously, Del Rey now seamlessly integrates this broader topic into a confessional discussion of her own personhood — a testament to her artistic maturity.
Accompanying these reflective movements in her lyrics are gentle accompaniments and pared-back production that takes on acoustic vibes. In songs like “Candy Necklace” featuring Jon Batiste, the piano shines through, its striking notes complementing Del Rey’s smooth vocals. In “Kintsugi,” the background music features minimal bass and dreamy-sounds that melt together. As such, in moments of intense revelation — such as when she asks, “Will I die? Or will I get to that 10-year mark?” in “Fingertips” — the full emotional weight of these lyrics are able to emerge in a meditative and vulnerable way, unfettered by the overproduction common in modern music.
However, even with the more acoustic direction the album takes, the tracklist never feels one-note. Instead, with varied pacing and different mixing styles, the album feels like a refreshing example of how authenticity can be blended with catchy, upbeat tunes. In “A&W,” the initial slow-ballad morphs into a rap set to a booming bassline towards the end of the song. Similarly, in “Paris, Texas (feat. SYML),” the melodic singing is paired together with rising melodies that generate a sense of dynamism.
Reminiscent of The Beatles, the rhythm of lyrics such as “Cause I love to love, to love, to love you. I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you” in “Let the Light In (feat. Father John Misty)” imparts an undeniable grooviness to the song even as Del Rey sings about her struggles. This build up in energy across the tracklist reaches its peak in “Peppers (feat. Tommy Genesis),” as Del Rey raps, “Hands on your knees, I’m Angelina Jolie.” Sonically and lyrically different from the rest of the album, it gives the tracklist a much needed playfulness after a series of more pensive songs.
This energy continues on to the final song, “Taco Truck x VB,” where VB refers to the song “Venice Bitch” from her earlier album, “Norman Fucking Rockwell.” The song begins with new lyrics and a new melody before blending into the old song “Venice Bitch,” now accompanied by a stronger bassline. An interesting stylistic choice, Del Rey shows her creative mastery as she updates her previous song, which already celebrates her ingenuity. Her own personal growth can also be seen as the yearning repetition of “Oh God I miss you on my lips” becomes less tragic and more playful in light of the new earlier addition to the song, where she teasingly asks for her lover to “Spin it 'til you whip it into white cream, baby.” The emotions expressed in her songs have become more complex and create an even richer experience for the listener.
Del Rey’s album is a triumphant celebration of her own emotional depths and creative genius. It is an experience that places Del Rey at the center — highlighting not her relationships or desires, but her growth, both personal and artistic, in all its difficulties and glories. The result is an album that is intensely moving without ever feeling cliché. When artists share their personal experiences, they always run the risk of coming off as performative. Del Rey manages to be vulnerable and authentic at the same time, making this one of her best albums to date.

Chase Fetti is one of the best rappers to come out of New Jersey in years. With an ear for vintage beats and a knack for raw lyricism, Fetti has become a standout figure in the East Coast underground scene. Hailing from the small city of Cliffwood, Fetti uses his music to reflect his Jersey upbringing, overcoming obstacles through his relentless drive to evolve artistically. As a result, Fetti has garnered a dedicated fan base and secured collaborations with prominent artists like Westside Gunn, 38 Spesh, Benny the Butcher, Elcamino, and more.
Fetti developed his distinct style and honed his craft by staying true to his Jersey roots and drawing inspiration from his immediate surroundings. According to the rapper, growing up in Cliffwood was tough, but his upbringing is something that inspires his music.
“Ain’t shit else but to sell drugs where I’m from,” Fetti said in a sit-down interview with The Harvard Crimson. “It's just a jail town, motherfuckers is in and out of jail.”
Cliffwood helped Fetti become the artist he is today.
“I'm the only rapper from Jersey that goes everywhere by myself. Chains on,” the rapper said.
This self-reliant attitude has led him to unique opportunities, such as meeting and collaborating with artists like Westside Gunn and Benny the Butcher, who appreciate Fetti’s authenticity.
Fetti was featured on Gunn’s September 2021 album “Hitler Wears Hermes 8: Side B,” a follow up to his appearance on the soundtrack to Griselda and BSF’s 2021 original feature film “Conflicted.” The Jersey rapper shared that he secured his placement on “Side B” at a video shoot for BSF rapper Heem. Westside Gunn and BSF founder Benny the Butcher were also in attendance and asked Fetti to contribute to the project.
“After that, I went to the studio with them to record the ‘Hitler’ joint. If I'm in a session and even if I ain't getting on a song, I'm writing the verse,” Fetti said, elaborating that if anyone “got eight bars” for him “I got that motherfucker.”
Chase Fetti’s rap career has been characterized by his independent spirit and determination. As an independent artist, Fetti manages himself and makes his own business decisions. Over the past two years, the artist has been on three tours, spending his own money to make it all happen. Touring, Fetti said, is hard.
“I went on tour with Butch. I didn’t pay to go on a tour, but I didn't get paid. I spent like 20 bands on that tour. This shit ain't for the weak. This shit is hard mentally and especially financially: If you ain't got no paper, pack this shit up because you're wasting your time,” Fetti explained.
Before making his mark on hip-hop, Chase Fetti was an accomplished high school basketball player in New Jersey, competing in the Amateur Athletic Union. He played alongside Andrew Bynum, who would later become a famous center for the Los Angeles Lakers. Fetti's time on the court helped shape his competitive spirit and determination, which he has carried over into his music career.
Eventually, Fetti traded sport for music. “Music is really the only way to make it,” he said.
Fetti shared that his upcoming project "Blender Talk" is finished and ready to be released. According to the rapper, the tape will showcase his growth as an artist and features production from Snub, as well as guest verses from Benny the Butcher, Elcamino, Conway the Machine, Tsu Surf, and more. Fetti also revealed plans for future projects with Boldy James and 38 Spesh.
“I can't wait to drop that shit. I ain't dropped a solo tape in two years. I didn't even notice. I just been floating around,” Fetti said. “I ain’t even noticed that all that time passed, because I was in motion.”
Fetti shared that 2023 will be a big year for him. "I just got to get the ball rolling,” the Cliffwood rapper added. “I'm gonna shake some shit up this year."

Feed The Family, a dynamic artist collective founded in Boston, is bringing authentic hip-hop back to Massachusetts. The group consists of four rappers native to the state: BoriRock, Dun Dealy, Shaykh Hanif, and TOP HOOTER. They are known for their group chemistry and hard-edged sound, which combines gritty street tales with a throwback-style production from in-house beatmaker Tremendiss. Rooted in their Boston origins, the group's influence within the East Coast underground continues to grow thanks to their recent output and strong connections with other rising Northeastern talents like MichaelAngelo, al.divino, and Estee Nack.
The group’s self-titled debut project, released in Jan. 2022, is a testament to their artistic chemistry and Massachusetts origins. The project captures the essence of their collective identity and artistic vision with standout tracks like “DUCK DUCK GOOSE” and “RELIEF,” which turn introspective and vulnerable storytelling into hard-hitting street anthems.
The four rappers in Feed The Family are all independent artists in their own right. Shaykh Hanif shared that he grew up listening to music from Dun Dealy and TOP HOOTER’s group RNO.
“I remember watching DVDs with Dun Dealy on it and everything like that,” Hanif said in a sit-down interview with The Harvard Crimson.
The idea of forming Feed The Family had not emerged until the recording sessions for their debut album had already begun, according to Dealy.
“I don't think originally it was really part of the plan, but the way the project came out and the whole process, it just only made sense,” Dealy said.
“It was like the perfect pie,” TOP HOOTER added. “It had all the ingredients and everything just came together crazy. The studio was a sanctuary for us.”
Hanif echoed his groupmates' assessment of how they came together, crediting BoriRock with the creative direction behind Feed The Family.
“I didn't think it was actually going to be a group or a project,” Hanif said. “Bori is such a visionary that he had all of this mapped out in his head before any of us even knew where he was going to take it.”
BoriRock came up with the group’s name randomly while driving and listening back to the tracks that would become the full length “Feed The Family.”
“When I went back to the studio, we did a song and I put the songs on a private SoundCloud link and just called it ‘Feed The Family’ because I liked how that name sounded,” BoriRock said. “The name came on its own because it wasn't like, 'Yo I'm gonna name it that.’ I just did it real quick for the link.”
Although the name arrived at the spur of the moment, the moniker holds deep meaning and reflects the group’s commitment to each other, their families, and their city.
“We all providers,” BoriRock said. “We all got family to look out for. It just means that you gotta put on. It's bigger than you type shit.”
In addition to bringing the group rappers together, BoriRock also introduced Feed The Family to their now go-to producer Tremendiss around 2016.
“Through him, I met everybody else, because we lived in the same house,” Tremendiss said. “Bori is my family, he lived on the first floor, I lived upstairs, so he was always watching me make beats.”
According to TOP HOOTER, the positive reception of the Feed The Family album strengthened the group’s resolve and inspired others from the local scene to rap.
“It's kind of life changing, because before we were all trying to find our way within ourselves. Now we formed this group and turned over a new leaf,” TOP HOOTER said. “Now everybody wants to rap again, which is cool because that's what we wanted anyway.”
With several projects in the pipeline, including solo work from individual members and the next Feed The Family posse album, the group is set to make a significant impact in the coming year. Hanif expressed the crew’s goal to elevate their state's musical representation and bring the local scene back to its roots, pointing out that legendary Gang Starr producer Guru originally hails from Boston.
“It was always a sound out here that was grimey,” Hanif said. “But, I feel like over time, Boston had lost that. It was a lot of doing what everybody else was doing, whether it was trap music or melodic rapping. So when Feed The Family came around, we took it back to the essence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chase is on — and it’s headed to Harvard. A taxi screeches to an abrupt halt and a man hurriedly rushes out. The year is 1939, the fugitive is a suspected Nazi spy, and his pursuers are FBI agents that tracked him all the way from New York. They see him run into one of the River Houses, but then, without warning, he seemingly vanishes into thin air.
Later, it’s discovered that the spy thwarted surveillance by sneaking through the Harvard steam tunnels, a secret maze criss-crossing underneath most of campus. For years afterward, it remains unclear how the spy was able to navigate them or how he even knew about the tunnels in the first place — the legendary, enigmatic labyrinth still largely unknown to most of the student body.
***
Throughout their history, the tunnels have served as something of a double-edged sword for Harvard authorities. In cases like the spy story, they’ve posed a security risk to law enforcement; in others, officers have been able to wield the network to their advantage.
When segregationist George Wallace spoke in Sanders Theater in 1968, Harvard Police escorted him out through the tunnels to avoid the potentially violent protesters outside. Similarly, when South African Consul-General Abe S. Hoppenstein was beset by anti-apartheid protesters after a 1985 speech in the Lowell Junior Common Room, he was ushered to a getaway car via the underground passageways.
The fabled history of the Harvard steam tunnels is so bizarre that the boundary between fact and fantasy frequently becomes blurred. A likely apocryphal story of the 1969 student occupation of University Hall holds that administrators fled the protestors through the tunnels, and urban legends of previous adventurers circulate in tunneling communities, slightly evolving with every retelling.
There is a recurring pattern of groups emerging for the purpose of exploring the underground. In the 1980s, an infamous cadre of “tunnel runners” was known for leaving graffiti on tunnel walls during their late-night expeditions. In 2013, a secret “Roofs and Tunnels” society got caught using the Lowell dish return to sneak into the steam tunnels. Just two years ago, a similar group named “Rho Alpha Tau” was formed to explore out-of-bounds corners of Harvard, but it has since died out. Between graffiti and spoken lore, there are indications that many other cohorts of tunnelers have come and gone, each leaving their unique marks on the subterranean mythopoeia.
All of these societies are drawn to the tunnels despite real danger — even small leaks in the steam pipes could be seriously hazardous. Besides this, there is also a legal threat: HUPD considers trespassing in the tunnels a criminal offense. Nevertheless, new disciples keep appearing, often exercising an almost religious reverence for the exploration of the unknown. They are the worshippers and the tunnels are their gods.
What repeatedly draws them to the altar? While there is the thrill of the cat-and-mouse game and the exhilaration of being somewhere off limits, the appeal goes beyond the elusion of authority.
Harvard’s steam tunnels are fundamentally a realm of mystery and intrigue. Consistently captivated by the unknown, tunnelers are drawn to interweave their own stories into the opaque history of the underground. In a place where myth and reality converge, the graffiti and stories that explorers contribute connect them to a colorful lineage of predecessors, in turn deifying them to their successors.

I live a 428.7-mile drive away from my mother. As she prepares breakfast for one in my childhood home, I lie asleep, enveloped in the sounds and stenches of my first-year dorm. While she fixes her hair for a big meeting, I have a heated debate on Annenberg Hall’s top five beverages. While she settles down with her favorite show before bed, I try to calculate how many times my Solo cup has been filled in the past hour.
Clearly, my mom and I lead very different lives. But despite the distance, we’ve found a way to stay connected beyond phone calls or text messages: through images in our shared camera roll.
A few months before moving to Cambridge, realizing that I’d never have enough storage capacity on my phone to keep up with the thousands of images I’d presumably be taking at college, I decided to give in to a nebulous, all-knowing space: the cloud. As a result of that decision, every image I take can be accessed from my mother’s device, and vice versa.
This strategy has its pitfalls. By nature, a photo album presents an opportunity to create meaningful bonds between photographer and viewer. A touching objective, sure — but there are parts of the college experience one just doesn't want their parent to see. Thus, I created a hidden album, which she has yet to find. The rest of my life, however, is fair game.
Predictably, sharing these intimacies, abstractions, and minutiae with my mom has stimulated a dialogue unlike any other. I’ve been forced to field a variety of interesting questions, like why my posture looks so bad in pictures, what the name of that person in my photo album who looks like Mark Zuckerberg is, and why there aren’t any pictures of me studying.
But regardless of these small annoyances, our shared space is still a wonderful thing. It represents a step towards the transparency that can be fostered between parents and children, despite the jolt of fear that this vulnerability often elicits for people my age.
Such an anxiety is all too familiar to me: As a child of a single-parent immigrant household, I craved my mom’s praise. I kept my head down, did well in school, and made nice friends, trying my best not to cause her any problems. I concealed from her facets of the real me. I’ve found that since entering college, the shared album has started to break down this barrier.
Beyond acting as a device for introspection, the photo album also helps to ease the burden of our physical separation. As I imagine may be the case for many of my peers as well, attending college away from home has created some strain on my relationships. Communicating long-distance is hard, and sometimes I can’t muster up the energy to give a play-by-play of my week over the phone.
But when I struggle to find the right words, my photo album can fill in the gaps. My camera roll tells the little stories of my life: the happy moments, like the day I got free Zinneken’s, to the less pleasant ones, like the time I realized that the strange smell in the dorm was coming from a molding slice of what I imagine was once pizza that my roommate had left in the fridge six months prior. When I can’t find the words to describe how I feel after a bad night out or convey the feeling of my pounding headache, the album has me covered.
Ultimately, the album acts as a sort of interactive diary. Nothing compares to the simultaneous feelings of joy and surprise that come with discovering a picture of my mom’s new Swiffer, or stumbling on a sneaky shot of my middle school gym teacher walking her dog.
Before consciously internalizing the idea that my photos exist in a common space, I never realized how much of my life I chose to capture through images. This semester, I have begun to reflect on what kind of narrative I’m creating through photography — how true a picture (no pun intended) I’m painting of my time on campus. In one fell swoop, a collection of my favorite people, best meals, and most questionable outfits can be accessed, my album an amalgamation of all of my highs and lows.
But despite the wide array of pictures that it carries, not every important moment makes it into my shared album. The story of my semester extends beyond my Tatte order to the more visceral moments of college existence: late-night heart-to-hearts, sweaty dance parties in the middle of the common room, and the butterflies I get before taking an exam. In that spirit, I’ve recently started trying to distill the collection: I print out my most impactful photos to let myself reflect on what I believe is truly worth sharing.
If you struggle to pick up the phone to call your loved ones during a hectic week, I recommend trying out a shared album or two. It’ll give you the convenience of streamlining your life updates — but more importantly, it’ll let you share a piece of yourself with those who care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to the many course assistants and teaching fellows who have devoted countless hours to our learning. When professors are unavailable and discussion forums look dire, we’re glad that you’re always there for us.
But you shouldn’t have to be. An investigation by our neighbors at The Crimson’s magazine last month found that often, CAs and TFs are expected to match or even exceed the level of instruction provided by objectively more experienced professors — all while receiving little pay and training on how to teach.
If Harvard is to continue with this CA- and TF-led model of undergraduate instruction, it must support CAs and TFs to the best of its capabilities, so that the students these instructors teach end up with the best education as well. CAs and TFs must receive standardized expectations and training in preparation for their teaching roles, course-specific resources and staff meetings in order to feel comfortable with the material, and, ultimately, fair wages for their invaluable services.
But a better Harvard wouldn’t rely on CAs and TFs for the brunt of its instruction.
We are disturbed by this broader trend in higher education where the educational work of tenured faculty is outsourced to non-tenure-track workers — CAs and TFs included — whom schools refuse to fairly compensate. As we’ve written before, these workers are the backbone of pretty much every undergraduate academic journey — and yet, Harvard still fails to deliver them a measly drop of its massive budget so that they can pay rent in Cambridge.
Meanwhile, many of the big name professors that Harvard credits as invested undergraduate educators are less involved in students’ intellectual development — and are sometimes equally inexperienced teachers to boot. Touted as scholars rather than instructors, these professors make groundbreaking contributions to research and human knowledge writ large, but their paths as academics may not have adequately prepared them to teach.
Harvard College considers itself a research and teaching institution, but the current hierarchy of its workers suggests that research has been prioritized to the detriment of teaching.
To reestablish teaching as a priority, Harvard should incentivize professors to teach smaller-sized classes, which cannot justify hiring a whole band of CAs and TFs to take over instruction in the absence of their professor. This might require hiring more professors to break up large lecture classes into smaller versions, until our student to faculty ratio — currently at seven-to-one — is truly representative of the in-class experience it purports to portray.
Further incentive to teach well comes in the form of labor protections and adequate wages — both major talking points of our graduate student union. It’s hard to focus on teaching while wracked with worries about one’s job security. Even for those who love to teach, there’s no incentive to pursue teaching professionally when there are no careers that pay living wages. We thus encourage undergraduate CAs and TFs to join the union that represents them, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, to leverage the union’s power in their own cases for better working conditions.
Given Harvard’s hefty billion-dollar budget, it can clearly afford to change the College’s teaching model, while fairly compensating everyone involved. It just needs to learn the importance of teaching again.

At the end of a hallway on the Science Center’s second floor, one small, but brightly-decorated office stands out from the rest. Its walls are adorned with a colorful array of thank-you notes, drawings, and photos of loved ones. The shelves are filled with an eclectic collection of objects: textbooks on statistical computation and complex function theory, oversized vectors used in his renowned class, Math 22: “Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra,” large prisms crafted to teach symmetry and group theory in Math 101: “Sets, Groups, and Real Analysis,” and student artwork reading “We <3 Dusty.”
This vibrant office belongs to associate Mathematics lecturer Dusty E. Grundmeier, who exudes contagious warmth and enthusiasm. One of the most beloved professors at the College and coordinator of the Emerging Scholars Program, which combats educational inequities by supporting freshmen from under-resourced high school STEM programs, his upcoming departure from Harvard has prompted students to reflect on his past eight years at the school.
For some students, Grundmeier has changed the trajectory of their academic careers. Luke C. Jackson ’24 was only in the third week of his freshman year when he found himself on the verge of dropping Math 22A. “I was really struggling,” Jackson says, describing how he emailed his concerns to Grundmeier. “He replied so quickly saying, ‘Let’s have a meeting before you drop the class.’”
When they met, Jackson realized that Grundmeier “wanted me to be there.” He says Grundmeier was honest about the amount of work the course would entail, but rather than discourage him, he asked Jackson, “How can I support you in actually learning this material?” Following the meeting, Jackson signed up for peer tutoring, went to more office hours, and “actually read every page of the text,” propelled by the confidence Grundmeier had in him.
“I felt like he believed that I could do it. And to me, it made me believe I could do it too, as cheesy as that sounds,” Jackson says. He went on to declare a concentration in Mathematics in his sophomore year and now serves as a Math 22 course assistant.
Grundmeier’s humble and sincere commitment to his students is the pinnacle of his popularity, his influence extending even beyond Math concentrators. J. Sellers Hill ’25, a Crimson News reporter and former student of Grundmeier, says he was pleasantly surprised that he formed a relationship with Grundmeier in a class that he was simply taking as a requirement for his Integrative Biology concentration.
“I do remember that he would read my Crimson articles,” Hill says with a laugh. “I’ve never had another teacher who’s mentioned reading my articles or has ever mentioned noticing my name.”
“I remember one time last year, before we walked in the class, he had a printed-out sheet of all 200 of the students, and he had little notes on each of them,” Jackson says. “He was like, ‘Oh yeah, I quiz myself on every single one of them.’”
Tommy D. Kaminsky ’24, a former Math 22 student and a current course assistant, calls Grundmeier “super approachable,” “sort of silly,” and “down to earth.” He says that what makes Math 22 such a great class is that Grundmeier turns “math into a game.”
“The first p-sets — they’re literally just math puzzles. You don’t even realize that you’re learning proof writing strategies until a couple of weeks in,” Kaminsky says. “Subconsciously, you learn all the tools you need to do useful stuff.”
With Grundmeier, Kaminsky says that math seems “fun and intrinsically exciting.”
Grundmeier shares that he didn’t always know he wanted to go into academic teaching. “I sort of discovered through teaching that I really liked teaching. And I kept enjoying it more and more as I went,” he says.
Grundmeier says he stumbled upon his position at Harvard through “a little bit of a lot of luck” — a fortuitous late job posting. His wife had received a job offer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and he wanted to work nearby. “I came to Harvard sort of through love,” Grundmeier says. “I was following my wife.”
Since Grundmeier started teaching Math 22A and 22B, student enrollment numbers in these courses have quadrupled.
“My teaching philosophy is to always center what you’re doing around the students and the student experience,” he says. “There’s a tension between trying to help — pushing someone to get them to grow and learn things — but not pushing them so hard that you break someone.”
It seems that Grundmeier has mastered that balance, according to his students.
“You can ask him anything but no matter how horribly you said it, no matter how badly you understand it — he’ll be able to answer it perfectly, and you’ll understand everything better,” Kaminsky says.
“A lot of these concepts are really complex, but he’s so methodical and clear, and he stops people at the right times,” he adds.
Students are sad to see Grundmeier leave Harvard. He will follow his wife next year, teaching in the math department at Ohio State University where she has accepted a tenured position as an Economics professor. Still, they share their appreciation for Grundmeier’s lasting impression on their experience at the College.
“He’s a great professor, but above all, he’s a great human,” Jackson says. “A real gem on this campus. I’m going to miss him so much.”
Upon leaving, Grundmeier wants to remind his students that he will continue to support them from wherever he is. “I’m always happy to be a mentor and a listening ear, to continue to give advice the best that I can,” he says. “I want them to know that I believe in them, and I’m so proud of them.”

Luke A. Williams ’23 was offered $15,000 and a college student’s dream: the chance to travel the world.
The summer after his freshman year, Williams pounded pavement in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, visiting hundreds of attractions, hotels, and restaurants.
Such was the life of a researcher-writer for Let’s Go, a travel guide written and produced by student members of Harvard Student Agencies. In decades past, Let’s Go was a well-known publication, appearing in Seinfeld and on the cover of the Economist. It counts acclaimed novelist Elif Batuman ’99, radio host Peter D. Sagal ’87, and food writer and YouTube personality Claire J. Saffitz ’09 — a former Crimson Arts editor — among its former employees.
Today, it has all but disappeared from travelers’ pockets, from the internet, and from Harvard’s campus. Its demise was seemingly caused by a perfect storm of flagging sales, a structure of high staff turnover, increasing competition from other travel companies like Lonely Planet and the growing army of travel influencers, a structure of high staff turnover, and the utter disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic.
HSA did not respond to a request for comment.
G. Oliver Koppell ’62 founded Let’s Go as a Harvard freshman, first as a pamphlet in 1959, then as a full guide in 1960.
“I meet people all the time that when I tell them I founded ‘Let’s Go.’ They often say to me ‘Oh! We used that! That was great. We used that when we first went to Europe!’” he says. “I’ve heard that dozens of times during my life.”
In the decades following its founding, Let’s Go steadily grew, reaching its peak in the late ’90s and early 2000s. By 2005, the Let’s Go website claimed a repertoire of over 50 titles translated into seven languages, with destinations for intrepid travelers on six continents. By 2009, the website claimed over 3.5 million guides sold in a decade. Now in his 80s, Koppel described Let’s Go as one of his top life accomplishments,
Though the organization is now defunct, in the 2000s, business was booming. With a staff of more than 90 employees and enough funds to send dozens of researcher-writers abroad, Let’s Go made a significant impact on campus life.
One Crimson article from 2000 mocked the supposed glamor of working for the guide, portraying the “r-dubs” as overworked and lonely and the offices in Cambridge as plagued by brutal editing sessions, favoritism, and intrigue.
But a Crimson article from 2007 suggested ill omens for the beloved travel guide, documenting the publication’s split from longtime publisher St. Martin’s Press. The global shift into digital media portended hard times for Let’s Go, facing the encroaching obsolescence of print travel guides.
The death blow came during the pandemic, when international travel was shut down. At the start of Covid-19 pandemic, Brammy Rajakumar ’23 had been recently hired to oversee all publications and was about to start searching for the next crop researcher-writers. “Based on the Harvard travel policies and the fact that students wouldn’t even be allowed to stay on campus, let alone travel, we couldn’t, in good faith, send anybody out to travel in Europe that year,” she says.
Rajakumar stepped back from the organization after her term ended, and, when students returned to campus en masse in fall 2021, Let’s Go never resurfaced.
Some at Harvard mourn the disappearance of Let’s Go.” “Many of the writers felt that their work with ‘Let’s Go’ was a very important part of their education actually. And some of them became journalists and they were pushed in that direction because of their work,” Koppell says.
“It changed the way that I travel in that I like to really spend time with the city now. The idea of Euro tripping and spending two days in Budapest makes me shiver,” Williams says. “But also, nothing built my confidence and independence and curiosity and wonder like this job did. Oh, it was really something special.”
“I wish that I was still around so that other people at Harvard would have the chance to have a once in a lifetime summer,” says Megan Galbreath ’20, who spent the summer before her senior year traveling Germany and Austria for Let’s Go.
HSA still lists Let’s Go as one of its subsidiaries, but contains only a short bio of the organization and a broken hyperlink. With the erasure of Let’s Go from the internet, writers like Williams and Galbreath lost the blog they’d toiled on, which Williams said he would occasionally look at and reference in job applications.
HSA leadership did not respond to several requests for comment.
Koppell was upset with the news that Let’s Go is now gone. “I just learned about a year ago that they had discontinued. I was very disappointed and shocked to hear it. I don’t know why they didn’t continue it, at least on the internet,” he says. “Now I think that HSA is doing tours of the Harvard campus, I think that’s a lot less interesting.”
As we speak, Williams becomes animated, recalling his adventures with passion and excitement. “It was literally everything that I had wanted to do for years of my life,” he says. “It makes me so sad that it’s gone.”

“You missed a spot.”
I turned and saw my coworker swipe sprinkles onto the floor.
I almost started to laugh — not because the experience was funny, but because it was so absurd. The scene transported me into one of those poorly-written teen movies with stereotypical mean girls and dry insults. It was as if Regina George had appeared before me, and I had no ability to react.
My surprise became anger once I realized that the sprinkle scheme was not directed towards me, but towards my twin sister, Amelia. I wanted to protect her, but did not know how.
We got the job at the same time, but Amelia moved her way up the hierarchy faster than me because of her work ethic and outgoing nature. When she was six, the swim team awarded her the title “social butterfly,” and indeed, she seemed to flutter up the social ladder with ease.
For whatever reason, many cannot resist comparing twins. It’s too easy. though we are fraternal twins, we are still siblings of the same age with supposedly identical life experiences.
But according to most, Amelia and I look and act nothing alike. Once, someone asked me, “How are you two even friends?”
With my twin, I feel like it’s us against the world. The world, on the other hand, seems that it would prefer us against each other. Over our 19 years, we’ve received comments such as, “Wow, your sister’s gorgeous! You look nothing alike,” “Oh, so you’re the disappointment, then?” and “How does it feel to have a sister so much smarter than you?” And my personal favorite: “You’re just so… different” (Ambiguity only baits the imagination.)
I had been weeding out such slights of comparison my whole life. But that Machiavellian ice cream store was where competition poisonously thrived.
Within a couple of weeks, Amelia began winning the more lucrative shifts and was treated better during them. She was hard competition — she counted back change with remarkable speed, pleased all the customers, and was a good gossip, too.
Amelia lightened every conversation with her smile and boisterous, honest laugh. She was often the center of attention and emanated joy, picking up a lot in tips on the way. But while any negative trait was an inconvenience, any positive one was a threat to the other girls, and Amelia had a lot of threatening virtues.
Her most egregious one was her kindness. Granted, she was not perfect. Who doesn’t like to gossip? But Amelia never participated in character assassination or ostracization. So, when one girl bore the wrath of many after drunkenly kissing another’s crush from two years prior, Amelia, refusing to shame her, bore it too.
The “betrayed” rallied her allies, and together they humiliated the “betrayer” to tears. They made secret group chats to trash talk her, purposely scheduled her shifts when she was unavailable, and even told our boss lies about her competence. Suddenly, the three of us found desolate loneliness during those long, summer shifts. It was the era of swiped sprinkles and sneering laughs. Once, when my sister and I were coming into the store, the door was locked. The girls inside said, “Don’t let them in.”
After the drunken-kiss fiasco blew over, Amelia’s popularity returned. With the quasi-hazing rituals that we had to endure — I had grown terrified of public criticism by the other girls about my counter-scrubbing abilities — I found myself wanting that popularity too. I started competing with her in the most profound of ways: making the perfect ice cream cone. We analyzed swirl, height, and width and even measured the weight in grams. When we worked the same shifts, we exchanged glares as we received our hierarchical duties: who would have to take orders and who would make the ice cream.
During that time, the two of us deeply resented each other. It was sophomore year. We were both struggling with depression in our own ways, and we took it out on each other. She was tired of being called stupid next to me, and I was tired of being invisible next to her. So, if I helped her with math homework, I tutored with a sharp and unforgiving tongue. If she had plans with friends, I would be left in the dust. We said horrible things to each other — worse than the comparisons we so despised: “You have no work ethic. You’re not even fucking trying.” “You have no friends for a reason. Why would anyone want to be around you?”
Behind those words, we really meant: “This is really hard. I’m frustrated and don’t know what to do. Please help.”
Amelia and I have repaired our relationship since, but the dangers of comparison still linger. Even today, every time I show a photo of Amelia, or introduce her, I dread what comments may follow. Sometimes, I even expect them and attempt to beat others to it. I compare myself to my twin to lessen the hurt.
I despise the words we exchange in efforts to bruise each other. I despise that, even if it’s just for a moment, I want her light to dim so it does not compete with mine. Because in the end, I love my sister for her brightness and joviality, her inclination to exaggerate, her wit and social genius. I love how she stuns others with her personality and beauty, and how she’s completely unaware of it.
In the end, I think that’s what we all are: unaware. We can recognize that value does not arise from comparison, but we don’t always feel it to be true. At least I don’t.
Luckily, I don’t have to. I have my sister, and that is enough. She loves me, and I love her. We share our insecurities with each other, because we are able to uplift each other. Oddly enough, we overcame our bitter jealousies and miscommunication by suffering from the words of others. Even in our bad moments, Amelia and I protect each other.
Last semester, Amelia’s friends began to ostracize her — starting rumors, calling her names, and even taking videos of her while she wasn’t looking.
“They’re being immature, jealous assholes, and you’re worth so much more than that,” I told her, listing all the reasons why she is.
Conversely, last semester, there was a moment when I felt terribly alone. Self-doubt swelled in my mind and spilled out my mouth. It was Amelia who first helped me defy those thoughts. Only she could do it.
Amelia and I are about to turn 19, and it is the first birthday that we will celebrate apart. But I am more excited for this birthday than I have been for any other. Whereas in high school, birthdays could feel like another reminder of how our peers viewed us rather than how we viewed each other, now, I care only about Amelia and having a whole day dedicated to loving her.

Overlapping disasters marked Harvard Divinity School master’s student Aliyah S. Collins’s final semester as an undergraduate at Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville. The onset of Covid-19 lockdowns followed a series of devastating tornadoes in the area, leaving Fisk without power and Collins struggling to juggle a part-time job, classes, and the stress of moving.
This experience, in part, was the inspiration for the Eco-Healing Project, which Collins founded last fall to “help HBCU students heal and recover from the impact of climate disasters.”
Collins notes that there is a unique, intersectional impact of climate disasters for HBCU students, especially those who are low-income. “A lot of students face or experience a lot of PTSD, stress, depression, just having to navigate the climate disaster,” Collins says.
Collins’s work on the Eco-Healing Project has a distinctly spiritual focus. Inspired by her education and interest in ecospirituality, she centers planting and gardening as part of the healing process.
“It’s not just like you’re putting seeds in the ground and watering those seeds,” Collins says. “You’re being intentional, you’re being mindful around these same practices we do with the Earth. These are the same practices we could do with ourselves.”
Today, Eco-Healing is planning to run a pilot program at Bennett College, an all women’s HBCU in Greensboro, North Carolina. The HBCU established a Green Team two years ago, and Collins hopes that Eco-Healing can supplement and support this effort by raising money for it and bringing ecospirituality and ecotherapy programming to students. These events range from mindful gardening and nature walks to talks from activists and scholars.
Three months ago, Tom’s of Maine, a subsidiary of Colgate-Palmolive that sells toothpaste and deodorant, selected Collins as one of “five young BIPOC environmental leaders” as part of its new “Incubator” program. To help “amplify” her message, Collins will receive $20,000 in funding as well as the company’s mentorship and support.
Collins has been interested in theology since her sophomore year of college, when she was accepted into the Diversity and Explorations Program at Harvard Divinity School. Collins became a Mellon Mays fellow and began research into ecotheology, focusing on the relationship between religion and nature, particularly in light of environmental concerns.
In college, Collins also explored ecowomanism — a framework that she says “ties the issues of the Earth to the issues that Black women are facing and sees them as one and the same.” She also took inspiration from Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” and “Song of Solomon” and Octavia E. Butler’s “Parable of the Sower.”
When Collins first came to HDS, she intended to focus on policy work and Pan-Africanism. Her interests began to evolve, though, and Collins found herself once again interested in eco-spirituality, in part because of her experience working at a multi-faith center in Framingham.
She connected with people from different faiths and traditions, observing a connective tissue in the spiritual relationships people had with the natural world. She came to see how a tree, which she used as an example, can be a spiritual object with disparate meanings across religious traditions.
“A tree is not just a tree,” she says, “a tree is a living thing that’s connected with us.”
Collins believes that access to nature is essential. She recalls a memory from last summer that helped spark this project: She was living in Chicago and often went to a little park that hugged Lake Michigan to escape her troubles. But she learned that there were Black kids in Chicago trapped in “concrete jungles” who had yet to go to this lakefront.
Collins believes students at Fisk and other HBCUs, which are “oftentimes in lower-income communities and neighborhoods,” have the same experience.
“Lower-income neighborhoods, underserved neighborhoods, obviously don’t have access to nature spaces that are close,” she says. “Of course, that’s going to have a negative impact on your mental health.”
The mission of EcoHealing is to provide “equitable access to nature so that students can be able to use that to heal,” she says.
“Climate justice is racial justice,” Collins says. “They go hand in hand. They are the same.”
As for the future of EcoHealing, Collins is hoping to expand the project to more HBCUs and incorporate it as a nonprofit.
“It is not for the weak,” Collins says of the work. “It’s gonna be a long journey just trying to get this up. But, thankfully, I have a lot of help.”

Alina Yu ’25 is showing me a hilarious and terrifying video in the middle of a Harvard undergraduate dining hall in Mather House. In the video, her friend is participating in a virtual reality experience that she helped build; we can see what he sees. As he walks down a pitch-dark spiral staircase, surrounding him are huge projections of his face — but wrong. One face is stretched out and fish-eyed. One is grinning terribly. When he reaches the bottom, he sees a looming, grotesque 3D model of his head. The teeth are enormous.
This experience, Yu says, is “for you to literally face yourself.” It explores the horror of introspection. She calls the exhibit “Recognition.”
Yu, alongside 17 other students, participated in a winter break artistic residency run by Conflux, a club founded last September that’s focused on creating art tech — the combination of art and technology. The founders, Peggy Y. Yin ’25 and Alice X. Cai ’25 met over the summer in Harvard’s Summer Undergraduate Research Village Program and realized they had a mutual interest in art tech.
One semester later, Conflux became a fully-operational club based in Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. During its three-week winter residency, students participated in workshops exploring new creative mediums and built final projects for an exhibition.
The residents began by experiencing new creative practices that combined tech and art. In a workshop with Rus Gant, director of the Visualization Research Laboratory at Harvard, they played with reflective materials, learning about “the way that you can use light to create entirely different worlds,” says Liya J. Jin ’23, a student who participated in the program this winter.
During another workshop, with artist Jacek Smolicki, they learned about “sound walking,” where one remixes the ambient noise of a location as they walk through it. For example, Smolicki led them on a sound walk through Harvard Yard — to Jin, “it was literally like witnessing a DJ set.”
After two weeks of workshops, the residents began their projects for the exhibition, which took place in the Student Clubhouse in the Science and Engineering Complex, which houses SEAS. Yin approached Taylor Fang ’25, a poet, dancer, and photographer, to set the mood with an “atmospheric poem” about the space.
The poem was projected onto the room’s roof beams, then animated — its stanzas moved around the ceiling. When writing the poem, Fang said, this extra consideration influenced her creative decisions. Because people entering the space might only see a few bits of the poem at a time, “each line had to stand on its own.”
In addition to its winter residency program and exhibition, Conflux has hosted a variety of one-off events. Last year, they held a workshop where students generated art using OpenAI’s generative art tool DALL-E, then printed their creations on t-shirts. For Halloween, they hosted an event called “Nervous Networks,” where students hooked themselves up to heart rate monitors to play a horror game with a twist: their heart rate impacted the gameplay and other players’ experiences. They’ve also hosted a number of trips and exhibition visits to lean from professionals in the art-tech world.
Conflux’s members say its social aspect is key to its success. Aida Baradari ’25 tells me that everyone in Conflux has a “vibrant energy” and that they’re able to pull off such involved events because everybody wants to be there.
I sit in on a planning meeting for their upcoming Arts First event, which is called “Musical Chairs.” According to Conflux’s website, Musical Chairs uses “augmented furniture to increase intra- and interpersonal awareness of expression.” Each part of the project — from coding up a voice transcriber to building furniture from scratch — seems like an enormous undertaking to me, but they’re so enthusiastic about it. As the team discusses the intricacies of carpentry and backend development, I find myself nodding along.
Aside from “Musical Chairs,” Conflux is also working on a project called “Notes on Love.” They’re using data visualization to explore how college students see love, and visitors will be invited to discuss their own ideas of love alongside the data. Baradari hopes this gives students the opportunity to “be vulnerable.”
Conflux’s members say it fills an important niche on campus. To Fang, Conflux is special because it merges art and tech. It’s not just “at the intersection” of the two fields, but combines them to make something interesting and totally new.
When you mention art-tech to someone new, “it’s almost a free ticket to their attention,” Max B. Allison ’25 says. As tech director of Conflux, he frequently talks to people outside of Harvard to source the tools and equipment Conflux needs. From MIT students to industry professionals, “a lot of people are like, that’s crazy. I want to be involved with that.”

My first semester at Harvard, I was terrified of mirrors. I’d glance at the one hanging on the back of my dorm room door and become obsessed with what it reflected, trace lines across the glass in a compulsive attempt to piece my features together. When I shifted, and the shadows shifted with me, I became increasingly disturbed rather than relieved. Despite everything I had been taught about the realness of my flesh, I constructed conviction upon conviction that I was little more than a trick of the light.
***
Sometimes I have very particular thoughts, like I’m going to have Berryline after dinner on Thursday, or I’m going to get a tattoo in August. I always know they’re going to come true before they do. You might say it’s a matter of my agency in making them happen, but I think it’s more like a glimpse I have into the next phase of my timeline: celestial and brief.
When the sentence I’m going to be on the club ultimate team next semester appeared in my brain in mid-January of last year, fraught with that particular deterministic cadence, I was more than a little confused. I’d never played frisbee in my life. And trying something new on Harvard’s campus is scary; it cracks whatever facade of being perfect you’ve put up.
But when the heavens call, what am I to do but listen? I emailed the contact listed on the team website. The captains told me their roster was normally finalized by the fall’s end, but if I came back to campus early for their pre-semester training camp, I could try out for the team. So I bought myself some new cleats and moved my train ticket forward a week.
***
I left my room at 6:30 a.m. my first morning with my hair tied up, loose strands pinned back, cleats dangling from my gloved hands. The wind seared red into my cheeks as I made my way over the Charles River, and I wondered when the sun would rise.
The first thing I noticed about the Bubble, where practices take place in winter, is that its sky is white. What look like upside-down laundry hampers hang from the ceiling, casting a luminescent glow across the massive half-orb. The aura endows the space with a sense of timelessness: It could equally have been seven in the morning or seven at night.
The second thing I noticed was that the Bubble didn’t feel like Harvard — not the Harvard I knew, at least. It smelled like turf and sweat and the utter demolition of pretense. There is only one thing to think about in the Bubble, and that is the rule of the game.
I became painfully re-acquainted with my body that week. I learned that when I jogged in circles my calves and my left knee got sore, but my adrenaline covered up the soreness. I noticed that breath scarred my throat when I’d been running for too long, and the edges of my feet were unused to pressure; blisters settled beneath my cleats. I learned that two two-hour sessions a day is a lot of time practicing, and it’s best to lie perfectly still in bed in between.
As the rest of the team scrimmaged at the end of practice one night, I sat off to the side with one of our coaches. She recreated the vertical-stack formation the team plays in with plastic cones, explaining the cycle of cuts and resets that lay the foundation for the game. “Does that make sense?” she asked, restlessness showing through her furrowed brow. She was on a pro team — she lived and breathed frisbee. I understood that to her, the gift of comprehending the game was the greatest one she could give me.
“Yes. It does,” I said. It actually made about half-sense, but I wasn’t about to say that out loud; I knew it would click eventually. The more important thing was that I had witnessed the magic some people found in this sport. I learned something entirely new that day; I hadn’t learned something so new in a long time.
***
I really don’t like being bad at things. It’s a quality that many of us here share: We got here by finding pursuits — mostly in our comfort zones — that we had a natural affinity for, and then we worked until we became the best at them. But turning that quality into a lifelong habit tends to engender perfectionism. And I am absolutely positive that in the long run, perfectionism does far more harm than good.
I was fairly terrible at frisbee that first week. I couldn’t throw a forehand for the life of me, and the phrases yelled from the sidelines — watch the inside, no around, force backhand, strike, no upline, she’s going deep — left me feeling a little like I was in the middle of a tornado.
But being terrible at something is also kind of like gulping a breath of fresh air. It didn’t matter how many times I messed up; I didn’t have anything to prove, to myself or to anyone else. I could try a throw or catch or cut in an entirely different way without being worried that it would make a teetering mountain of success come crashing down, because I was at the base, my feet on solid ground. I’ve come a long way since my first training camp practice; I have even farther to go. But that’s the point, isn’t it?
The rest of what I learned at training camp? That the people who play this game are a little bit one-of-a-kind. Their stances are loaded with the capacity to spring up and catch uncatchable discs, but they are also closer to the earth than most anyone I’ve met on campus before.
There is something about setting hours of your time at Harvard aside just to play frisbee with your friends that is quietly rebellious, even a little exhilarating. The people who do it see giddy laughter less as a choice than a necessity. Moving my body with them on a field across the river — breathing in cold sunset-laden air, tossing discs back and forth — has started to feel like home.
There is something about the flow of the game that requires me to become unselfconscious; I’m able to inhabit my skin instinctively. The kind of movement the sport requires — sprinting, jumping, crashing back onto the ground — is of a distinctly embodied character.
When I look in the mirror after practice, I find that my body is legible to me in ways it never used to be: my muscles made real in my reflection by remnants of sweat, my cheeks textured by wind.

Walking into Menschel Hall at the Harvard Art Museums last Thursday, listeners expect to hear a lecture from best-selling author Tommy Orange. Instead, Orange reveals excerpts from his upcoming book, “Wandering Stars,” set to be released in spring 2024.
In 2018, Orange published his debut novel “There There,” which tells stories about Native American characters and their relationships with their identities. The novel received great acclaim, including the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award, the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize, and recognition as a Pulitzer Prize Finalist.
Before the lecture commences, Elizabeth Solomon, member and treasurer of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag, acknowledges and honors the land. This “native space,” she says, not limited by legal boundaries, is where the Massachusett tribe “raised our children and honored and buried our dead.” She goes on: “We do not live in this place. We are of this place.”
Orange then takes the stage, wearing an all-black ensemble, other than his patterned flat-top baseball cap and gray Adidas hightops. He tells the audience he originally had planned to give a lecture on “There There” titled “The View From Here: POV, Its History and Uses in Fiction.” However, after talking to some Indigenous students on campus the night prior, he decided that an insight into his new novel “Wandering Stars” was a better idea. The audience is delighted.
Orange grips the podium with his left hand and phone with the other, reading the narratives of characters Vicky, Orvil Red Feather, and Lony Red Feather to a captivated audience. Afterwards, Mishuana Goeman, a member of the Tonawanda Band of Seneca and a professor of gender studies and American Indian studies, converse with Orange about “There There” and how “Wandering Stars” relates to it.
Orange says that his new novel will be both “a prequel and a sequel” to his first, following some of the same characters’ narratives as well as introducing new ones. Lony, for instance, is in “There There,” but speaks for himself for the first time in “Wandering Stars.”
During the interview, Goeman asks Orange about how he found his own voice. Orange explains that it was a “weird and winding path,” but authors such as Denis Johnson, Louis Erdrich, and Robert Walser helped him along the way. Erdrich’s novel “Love Medicine” served as the inspiration for Orange’s use of multiple perspectives in "There There.” Orange says his background as a musician also helped him develop his style, which emphasizes rhythms and cadence. He says he “thinks about the sound of sentences when revising.”
Orange’s career has also been defined by diverse cultural experiences, his own and otherwise. Having worked with native communities through a non-profit and engaging in digital storytelling of native narratives, Orange found he did not need to conduct much scholarly research for “There There.” Rather, he incorporated his and his community’s experiences.
However, Orange does have some regrets about which types of experiences he drew from.
“I feel a great shame for not doing more for Oakland native peoples,” Orange says. He explains that he did not want to “tell their stories” for them, but acknowledges that excluding Oakland’s native peoples entirely was a mistake. In “Wandering Stars,” Orange includes these Indigenous groups he neglected before.
Goeman contributes elements of critical analysis to the conversation. She notices that Orange’s works contain recurring detailed descriptions of characters’ bodies, which she connects to “fleshy” writing. She explains that “fleshy” writing comes from Black studies while describing colonized bodies, and suggests that when colonized people are forcibly separated from their geographic homes, the body is all that is left. Moreover, the body outwardly bears the marks of this violence.
Orange replies that this tendency was not intentional, though he does concede that the body can bear the marks of history, restating an old saying he was told as a child: if a Native American has freckles, some white person ‘got in there somewhere.’
Orange also contemplates the body in his books when his characters struggle with being “ambiguous non-white persons.” In particular, he points to the difficulty of exploring an Indigenous identity when the ways of authenticating Indigenous identity “are hurtful and harmful.” Goeman and Orange speak about how most Americans cannot trace their lineage more than two to three generations back. However, Americans often expect Native Americans to have a “pure” ancestral connection, even though the American government have contributed to erasing their culture for centuries.
Though Orange tackles weighty topics in his writing and in his talk, he’s also familiar with his audience. Orange responds just as easily to questions about archival research as he does to a question from an audience member on the correct terminology for the “Indian Taco” or the “Navajo Taco” (“Indian Taco, of course,” he answers). He jokes about the lewdness of teenage conversations in his book just as eloquently as he meditates on the personal, often identity-driven, quandaries of his characters.
As Orange put it in “There There,” “Novels are good at carrying their passengers from one destination to another, from one world to another, one person or community to another.”
Several interviews in this article were translated from Portuguese by João Pedro Rocha Frazão ’26.
One morning in 2015, Ariomara “Mara” Alves Pessoa woke up as she usually would in her home in Santa Filomena, Piauí, Brazil. Since as far back as she can trace her lineage, Alves Pessoa’s family has lived on this land in Piauí; she has spent her entire life here. But that day, a stranger arrived with armed “security men” and identified himself as the owner of a nearby farm.
This was not the last she would hear from this man. He and his two “‘security men,’” she says, arrive often, always armed. Thus far, they have forced 12 families in her community, Barra da Lagoa, to move, Alves Pessoa says.
Resisting this eviction isn’t easy, Alves Pessoa tells us in an interview translated from Portuguese. “They walked with guns on their hips and wanted to scare us,” she says.
Though the employers of these “security men” remain unknown, they were likely sent by one of the large-scale farms near Alves Pessoa’s home, one of which the Harvard Management Company owned through its subsidiary company, Insolo Agroindustrial S.A.: Fazenda Fortaleza. As large-scale farms, including those owned by Insolo, arrived in Piauí, locals like Alves Pessoa have lost significant parts of their land and access to critical resources, and some residents have been moved off their land entirely.
From 2008 to 2016, HMC, which is responsible for investing Harvard’s $50 billion endowment, spent more than $1 billion on nearly a million hectares of farmland across the United States, Brazil, Eastern Europe, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, according to a report by Genetic Resources Action International, or GRAIN — a farming activist group with a focus on the Global South — and the Brazil-based advocacy network Rede Social de Justiça e Direitos Humanos. The report also claims that $400 million of those acquisitions are located in Brazil, where HMC purchased 405,000 hectares of farmland, totaling more than twice the size of all the farmland in Massachusetts.
The two advocacy groups traced HMC’s investments through multiple levels of subsidiary companies, some of which were based as far as the Cayman Islands, and reported that HMC ultimately controlled three operator companies that purchase Brazilian farmland. Together, these operators purchased more than 40 rural properties by 2016, according to the report.
Per the report, HMC’s land acquisitions were largely fit for lucrative monoculture crops, including sugarcane, soybean, and cotton, as well as a site for an ethanol refinery. However, many of their properties remained idle.
Many of HMC’s landholdings were in the states of Bahia and Piauí, which include vast regions of the often overlooked Cerrado region, according to a map by climate consulting group AidEnvironment. The Cerrado, known as the “birthplace of Brazilian waters,” is a vital water source for much of the country, and with its position on the edges of the Amazon, is a key ecosystem for the fight against climate change.
Since making its initial investments, HMC has sold some of its properties in Brazil. In 2017, it reduced its natural resources investments from $4 billion to $2.9 billion, according to a 2019 Bloomberg article.
In October 2020, HMC spun out its natural resource team, which had strategized and coordinated farmland purchases, to a new independent investment firm: Solum Partners. HMC then partnered with the newly created firm Solum Partners. Colin Butterfield, who was the managing director of natural resources, became the CEO and managing partner of Solum Partners.
Every other member of Solum Partners’ senior leadership — including each of its three managing directors, its COO, and its general counsel — also worked for HMC. All but one, whose precise position at HMC we could not identify, worked for HMC’s natural resources team. When HMC spun out Solum Partners, its farmland investments went to Solum Partners. HMC remains invested in Solum Partners.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on this article.
Long before HMC came to the Cerrado, though, people were living there, including subsistence farmers and cattle ranchers whose families have lived on the land for generations, Indigenous people, and quilombolas — descendents of escaped and freed slaves.
As large-scale investors like HMC came into northeastern Brazil, small farmers like Alves Pessoa faced difficulties living on their land. Many have been displaced by companies because they lack a formal title to the land that their ancestors occupied for decades, if not centuries.
Even if locals manage to remain on their land, they are still affected by pollution from industrial farms. When industrial farmers arrive, they tend to deforest wide swaths of land for their plantations and allow chemical fertilizers and pesticides to run off into rivers used for drinking water and irrigation.
Alves Pessoa tells us that her community lives with “fear, the fear of losing your place, where you were born and raised and where you make a living.” She adds that there is “insecurity about what is going to happen to you. The threats, not knowing what will happen to you today or tomorrow.”
Although the full extent of HMC’s former landholdings remain concealed behind a complex web of private equity firms, associated subsidiary companies and investment partners, what is clear is that HMC’s purchases contributed to a climate of anxiety, fear, and strain on Brazilian subsistence farmers.
The University says investments like these are made to serve its students, scholars, and, by extension, the world. But for faculty, staff, and students alike, this raises critical questions: What are Harvard’s ethical obligations in spending its immense wealth? More fundamentally, how should students and faculty hold the University accountable in cases of potential exploitation?
João Henrique Pereira Mendes, a subsistence farmer who lives near HMC’s land purchases in the town of Gilbués, Piauí, tells us he first heard about Harvard from human rights organizations. After Pereria Mendes finishes speaking, João Pedro Rocha Frazão ’26, who is translating our call with Alves Pessoa and Pereira Mendes, pauses for a moment, then explains, “He doesn’t even understand that Harvard is a college. He thinks it’s a company.”
As we begin our call, Pereira Mendes meanders, attempting to find a comfortable spot. As he moves, slivers of light draw lines across his spectacled face and bright yellow tee shirt. He settles in a spot where a white concrete wall meets a roof made up of long thin wooden logs. The light brings out the threads of gray in Pereira Mendes’ well-kept mustache.
As familiar with his surroundings as he looks, Pereira Mendes has not always lived in the room he calls in from. He first noticed large agricultural operators establishing farms in the area in 2013, one of which was owned by HMC. Soon thereafter, he and his family were forced to move from their land.
Until the farms arrived, life for Pereira Mendes and his neighbors was as it had always been: they rose early in the morning and found their way to the land they farmed on, to reap and sow by hand. In nearby areas, they picked fruit from hanging branches.
Pereira Mendes also used to fish frequently in the river, but he can no longer do that, he tells us. We ask him why that is. Bemused, he replies, “We fish but cannot catch anything. There are no more fish.”
This is because the water, as Pereira Mendes puts it, is “contaminated.”
Locals tried to find a solution. “Some locals in the region are raising them,” Pereira Mendes says. They began installing water tanks around their homes to collect rainwater in which they hoped the fish would survive.
But, this only works until Brazil’s dry season each year. “In early winter, many of the fish die,” he says. “So we have to buy fish at the market.”
The soil has also been contaminated. Agrotoxins in the soil have made the produce Pereira Mendes and his community once grew and ate “diseased,” he says.
River pollution and soil contamination are both results of large-scale farms operating in the Cerrado.
According to Devlin Kuyek, a lead researcher of the GRAIN report, HMC likely bought land in Brazil hoping to profit from industrial farming. These purchases were seen as stable long-term investments, which was appealing in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.
“For institutional investors, they looked at what happened with the collapse of the stock market in 2008 and started to shift more of their portfolio to what we call ‘alternative investments,’” he says. “That could be private equity, that could be timberland, that could be real estate funds, or farmland.”
Carlos Portugal Gouvêa, a former visiting professor at Harvard Law School who studies corporate governance and human rights in Brazil, explains that at the time that these purchases were first made, farmland in Brazil was cheaper than in other parts of the world, and so land in Brazil was a particularly good purchase.
“At that point, Brazil was already on the rise to become a food superpower,” Gouvêa says. “If you buy that land and you can control the production of those goods, imagine how much power it would mean.”
But for these farms to operate, they first need to deforest the land to clear space for cattle raising and large-scale agriculture, Eduardo Souza-Rodrigues, an associate professor in the Economics department at the University of Toronto and former fellow at Harvard’s Center for the Environment, tells us.
Deforestation of the Cerrado poses a significant threat to the rest of the world because the Cerrado, like the Amazon, is essential to limiting the effects of climate change. Although its forests appear sparse, they hide vast underground root systems that absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide.
Even more carbon dioxide is released if trees are burned to clear the land, a common practice in the Cerrado. When that happens, all the carbon already captured in those trees is released, too. Fires kill plants and wildlife, destroying their habitats. Areas of the Cerrado that have seen a higher number of fires correspond with where the farms Harvard was invested in are located, according to maps drawn by GRAIN.
To prevent further deforestation, Brazil’s government instituted what Souza-Rodrigues says was an “extremely successful” plan that drove deforestation down to a quarter of its 2004 levels by 2012. The system used satellites to photograph the same patches of land nearly everyday, which allowed the government to carefully measure deforestation.
With Brazil’s election of President Jair Bolsonaro, who did not prioritize the environmental threats facing Brazil, deforestation accelerated back up to its 2008 rate and has yet to recover. In Brazil in 2008, an area approximately the size of Massachusetts was deforested, Souza-Rodrigues says.
The Cerrado specifically has seen 50 percent more deforestation than the Amazon, losing over 10 million hectares of trees over the past decade, the report by GRAIN and Rede Social says.
The two advocacy groups reported that, according to sustainability research group Chain Reaction Research, Harvard has funded the deforestation of 53,000 hectares of Brazilian land. That is as if Harvard deforested the city of Cambridge about 28 times.
Now, Alves Pessoa’s home of Santa Filomena, one of the areas of Piauí where HMC purchased farms, is not as she remembers it.
“Before we were free to fish, bathe in the river, go wherever we wanted to. We wouldn’t hear about these things — farms, landowners,” she says.
But now, the neighboring industrial farms contaminated the nearby river, which was her family’s source of drinking water. Their village decided to dig a well for water instead — only to discover that that water too was contaminated. They have continued to drink that water anyway.
“Life has changed,” Alves Pessoa says. “Communities are having to survive, not live.”
Pereira Mendes was out hunting one day when a man suddenly approached him. The man told him that the land, which Pereira Mendes had hunted on before, now belonged to another farmer, and he had been sent to keep people off the farmer’s property. “The watchman said if he caught someone in his farm again, the order was to kill us,” Pereira Mendes says.
The arrival of wealthy farmers to Gilbués did not only prevent Pereira Mendes from accessing the land the wealthy farmers claimed— it also forced him to move.
Although it is unclear what company the watchmen work for, researchers from GRAIN and Rede Social traced at least two farms near Pereira Mendes’s town to HMC through its former subsidiary Insolo Agroindustrial S.A., which HMC owned 95.8 percent of and invested $138.7 million in. Insolo has purchased at least six farms in Brazil, the activist groups say.
When Pereira Mendes joined with others in his area to submit an appeal for a collective land title, the situation only worsened. After state officials arrived to collect population data for the land title in August 2018, Pereira Mendes started receiving more threats. This time, the threats were from his neighbors, whom he believes wealthy landholders paid to work as watchmen and spies.
“There are people who belong to both the farm and the community — not armed — come with a message. They say, ‘This land is not yours,’” Pereira Mendes says.
He cannot turn these men away because he does not yet have official rights to the land. While some villages in Piauí have achieved legal certification from the state authorities, others, including his, have not.
Without the official paperwork, Pereira Mendes and the other members of his community are told, “‘You cannot cut the wood for fences, cannot go fishing, cannot hunt.’” The distress this causes could be avoided, though. “If the state gave us a title we would not be worried like this,” he says.
This situation is not unique to Pereira Mendes. After generations of self-sufficiency, small farmers across the Cerrado now find themselve forced off land and unable to meet their families’ needs.
A farmer may have lived on a patch of land for as far back as his family tree stretches, but have nothing to show for it, at least not in the eyes of the law, Gouvêa explains. The law governing land titles — conceived as far back as 1973 during a period of military dictatorship — has not been updated fast enough for each hectare to have its original owner associated with it. And so, different groups can have competing claims to the land.
And yet, many of the families that large farms are displacing have lived there for decades, if not centuries. “They have been there at least for seven generations, at least 200 years. And these are indigenous communities, traditional fish communities, peasant communities, and quilombola communities,” says Maria Luisa Mendonça, the co-director for Rede Social, which maintains ongoing partnerships with local advocacy groups in the countryside.
Land ownership conflicts are exacerbated by a practice known as grilagem, the falsification of land titles. Due to a lack of government oversight in the region, grilagem is a ubiquitous practice in the Cerrado. Grileiros often threaten violence to strong-arm their way onto land held by families for generations, knowing that their appeals for land titles may stall in Brazilian courts. Anyone can engage in grilagem — an individual or a company, real or made-up — and anyone can be the victim, Gouvêa says.
“They use very sophisticated means. Sometimes they even use fake IDs or fake documentation,” he adds.
“They just fence an area and, with fires, deforest the area,” Mendonça says. “And then they put the land on the market as if it were legalized.”
In October 2020, a Brazilian court ruled that HMC and the pension fund manager Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association illegally acquired more than 500,000 acres of public land in the Cerrado. The court ultimately ruled that an HMC subsidiary purchased a 200,000-acre parcel of land that had been “illegally transferred to private ownership.” By 2020, HMC had already divested from the subsidiary company that managed the farm, Gleba Campo Largo.
Other land acquisitions linger in the courts. In 2013, Terracal Alimentos e Bioenergia, a different HMC subsidiary, claimed the land surrounding the village of Arthur Passos, according to GRAIN and Rede Social. Just three years prior, Arthur Passos had been recognized by the Brazilian government as a quilombola. Private companies do not have a right to quilombo land because Brazilian law guarantees the villages collective land titles.
Terracal razed forests to clear land for a large plantation. On what land remained, a private security group prevented the villagers from hunting, fishing, growing crops, grazing cattle, and collecting fruit from areas that they once used freely, GRAIN and Rede Social say.
HMC initially invested $270 million in Arthur Passos, and planned to commit an additional $350 million in 2015 according to the groups’ report. They eventually withdrew from that investment and ordered Terracal to sell the land. But, as of 2020, the HMC subsidiary’s parcel continued to sit idle for lack of buyers. In 2017, HMC pushed subsidiary Gordian Bioenergy to sell off Brazilian farmland. After contacting almost 70 potential buyers, the subsidiary still had not sold the land.
To make such investments in the first place, HMC navigates around a complex legal framework aimed against foreign investors. Since 2010, Brazilian law has restricted foreigners from controlling land in Brazil.
Gouvêa says these restrictions are easily avoided by setting up a local shareholding company, like Harvard’s subsidiary companies. “That would make it very easy to circumvent that restriction,” he says.
When small landholders first faced threats of violence and displacement, human rights organizations like Mendonça’s took notice. After learning of the land conflicts from her organization’s partners in rural Brazil, Mendonça partnered with Kuyek from GRAIN to investigate. In September 2018, Rede Social and GRAIN published a report detailing HMC’s investments in Brazilian farmland.
Through thousands of pages of tax filings and court proceedings, field visits, and interviews with impacted people, the researchers uncovered a “very aggressive” investment strategy, Kuyek says.
GRAIN and Rede Social uncovered three agribusiness operators through which HMC purchased farmland in northeastern Brazil. In addition to detailing the known investments of these companies, the researchers compiled firsthand accounts of conflicts between local farmers and newly-arrived agricultural companies. Many whom they interviewed, like Alves Pessoa and Pereira Mendes, spoke of forced displacement, armed threats, pollution of their soil and waterways, and deforestation. They lost access to land where they once hunted and collected food, water, and firewood.
This account quickly grabbed the attention of media outlets, including The Crimson, Bloomberg, and Mongabay, an American environmental news website, which reported on GRAIN and Rede Social’s investigations. It also provoked responses by environmental protections and human rights organizations and student activists at Harvard.
In 2021, GRAIN joined a petition by 50 organizations for a symbolic trial by the Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal, an international organization that tries human rights violators in symbolic trials. Since its founding in 1979, the Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal has ruled on 51 cases ranging from Chernobyl to pandemic authoritarianism. Its judgments seek to address legal contradictions or gaps in international jurisdiction on peoples’ rights.
From 2021 to 2022, the tribunal held an unofficial trial of the Brazilian government and private companies operating in the Cerrado, including HMC. Ultimately, the tribunal found HMC complicit in ecocide.
Joice Bonfim, who worked on the case, explains that the meaning of ecocide extends beyond environmental destruction. “Ecocide is the socio-environmental deep devastation promoted by agribusiness and miners, which cause genocide of the people,” she says in an interview translated from Portuguese. “If they cannot develop their lives and relation with the land, it is ecocide and genocide.”
“By seeking profits for their investment portfolios, they are unaware of the historical cycle of crimes and violations linked to land acquisition in the Cerrado, such as the grabbing of public lands, deforestation and pollution, contributing to a renewed cycle of speculation and expulsions of local communities,” the verdict, translated from Spanish, wrote.
McKiernan, the HMC spokesperson, declined to comment on the Tribunal’s ruling.
Other advocacy efforts helped locals learn more about land titles and the companies claiming their land. Often, local farmers receive information regarding their land from churches, which organize their own farmers’ advocacy organizations.
“We worry about this — more people coming and us losing land and not having a place to work or get food,” Pereira Mendes says. “It just makes it more difficult for us the longer it takes them to do the demarcation.”
Some advocacy efforts attempt to connect people across Piauí. Daniela Stefano, a researcher with Rede Social and editor of their annual human rights journal, works to connect farmers across the state to discuss the consequences of these purchases. She tells us that, last year, she developed a podcast and photography workshop for young people impacted by corporate farms.
“They went back to their communities, and, there, they collected the audios for the podcast,” Stefano says. They also trained young people to take photos of their communities, which were shared over WhatsApp alongside eight-minute audio clips testimonies from farmers.
“They started to be aware of how powerful they are, and how good it is to tell their own story, because this was also related to the history of the communities, how they arrived there, how they started to produce,” Stefano says.
“Because of this interaction between the people from the community, they know more about each other,” she adds.
Though the project was primarily for people in the communities, Stefano says, the project also grabbed the attention of those who want to learn more about land conflicts in the region, including members of advocacy organizations. “Now we would like to continue and expand, because people from other places are listening,” she says.
At this year’s Harvard-Yale football game, as the football players ran, passed, and scored, large painted banners hung behind them reading: ‘BORDERS’ ‘DIVEST’ ‘LAND GRABS’ ‘APARTHEID.’ Demonstrators held them up throughout most of the game, calling back to 2019’s Harvard-Yale game, when hundreds of people stormed the field at halftime to demand that Harvard and Yale divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt.
“What a powerful sight at this year’s Harvard-Yale match,” reads Stop Harvard Land Grabs’ statement. “A reminder that every second of every day, Harvard’s endowment is financing industries and systems that marginalize those who are imprisoned in or deported from the US, whose indigenous lands are stolen, or who live under a system of apartheid.”
Stop Harvard Land Grabs’s mission is “to end Harvard’s destructive farmland investments around the world and demand reparations,” they write on their website. The group’s mission also calls for Harvard, informed by those it has harmed, to “address the harm and return resources and wealth to those it has stolen from.” In addition to Brazil, Stop Harvard Land Grabs also directs its energy towards HMC’s land investments across the world, from California to Argentina to Australia.
Lydia S. Ghuman, a third-year student at Harvard Law School who organizes for Stop Harvard Land Grabs, explains that the group’s objective is to mobilize Harvard affiliates against the actions of the Harvard Corporation. “We’re really trying to figure out how to make the Harvard student body feel like they are culpable and — I don't want to say responsible for this issue — but that they can influence it.”
Ghuman makes sure to stress that “whatever efforts we’re coming up with to organize the student body to be more active around this issue is also informed by and aligned with those in Brazil who are fighting against this issue and also currently suffering from it.”
Stop Harvard Land Grabs’ advocacy efforts extend far beyond last year’s Harvard-Yale game. Rachel E. Carle, a Kennedy School student who also organizes for SHLG, says that her first protest action with the group, and the earliest she can remember, took place in 2013. That year, students were first investigating Harvard’s investments into timber holdings in Argentina, and their findings drove them to action.
After GRAIN and Rede Social’s report was released, Stop Harvard Land Grabs and Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard protesters sat in a long line across the Science Center Plaza on a sunny October day in 2019, bearing signs decrying Harvard’s landholdings in Brazil.
They were joined by Altamiran Lopes Ribeiro, a Catholic deacon from Piauí who aids generational farmers in securing land titles. He often travels around the Brazilian state, meeting people impacted by corporate land investments and communicating their needs to advocacy organizations. The protestors huddled around as he spoke. “The profit that comes from those investments,” Ribeiro told them, speaking in Portuguese, “is a profit that is tainted with blood, pain, and suffering from those communities.”
Three years later, Stop Harvard Land Grabs was back demonstrating in the Science Center Plaza, and marched to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office chanting, “From Boston to Brazil, Harvard’s land investments kill!”
In November 2020, the group published a report on Harvard’s endowment in collaboration with the Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, and Harvard Act on a Dream. Alongside calls for accountability and divestment, the report demands that Harvard increase transparency surrounding its endowment’s investments. “The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign for the last four or five years has just been asking: can you make your investments public? This is all we want,” Ghuman says.
Displacement is not alien to Ghuman. Her father’s family was moved according to the lines drawn in the Partition of India, and her mother’s family’s land was seized by military rulers in Ethiopia.
“They just lost everything when their land was taken,” she says.
“There are many, many students at Harvard, not just me, who are living with the history of land grabs, and many students from Brazil that are here and whose home country is getting ravaged by these investments,” she says. The Harvard International Office estimates that 231 students and scholars across the University currently hail from Brazil.
“While this can feel like a really abstract injustice at times, I think it’s also really, really real for so many students,” Ghuman says. “And I feel so horrific that I go to an institution that is doing that to people.”
On an unusually warm March afternoon, we walk to the second floor of Robinson Hall to speak to History professor and Department Chair Sidney Chalhoub. When we meet him, he is holding several sheets of paper, covered with notes written in dark black ink.
For more than 40 years, Chalhoub has been a historian of 19th-century Brazil, focusing, in part, on slavery and the changing conditions of Brazil’s working class. As we begin our conversation, Chalhoub references his notes before giving his answers, his eyes gliding down page after page.
Six minutes in, Chalhoub holds the notes up and says, “The reason I wrote this out is because this is a subject that causes in me a lot of indignation.” He pauses. “And I’d like to just be kind of pedagogical, so that I don’t say anything that I should not be saying.”
He looks down again and reads, with a combination of exasperation and passion: “Harvard as an institution professes to fight environmental destruction. It forces science and education on the subject. Harvard’s investments in farmland in Brazil caused significant environmental destruction. It polluted waters with chemicals, dried rivers, caused fires and deforestation. This contradiction between the values of the university and the practice of the Harvard Management Company is not acceptable. Harvard professes to defend social justice, and is concerned with social and economic inequality. There is an Inequality in America Initiative in FAS.”
He went on. “Harvard Management Company’s investments in farmland in Brazil contributed to the further concentrated land ownership. It increased the violence against and the expulsion of traditional rural communities from land they had held for generations. I repeat the same sentence. This contradiction between the values of the university and the practices of the Harvard Management Company is no longer acceptable. Harvard professes to defend democracy, transparency, and the rule of law–”
Chalhoub stops, looks up from his notes, and says to us: “Am I lying? Don’t you learn all these things?”
For Chalhoub, the issue with HMC’s investments runs deeper than what happened in Brazil. “This specific case highlights this contradiction that is right now at the core of the institution in my opinion,” he says.
Chalhoub believes that contradiction has to do with capitalism. “Why is it that our management company is still governed by a concept of capitalist growth and profit that we have criticized in the College, in the University in our knowledge production?” he asks “This contradiction is no longer tenable.”
Chalhoub has a word for this: savage capitalism. He uses it repeatedly, impassionately, over the course of our conversation. The headless pursuit of profit, turning a blind eye to vulnerable communities and the environment — that is savage capitalism to Chalhoub.
“The idea of limitless capitalist growth, and the idea that capitalism is just for profit however you make it, has brought us to this situation that we are in now,” Chalhoub says. “It is what could justify the idea of no transparency, no accountability, and profit at all cost that governs the actions of the Harvard Management Company.”
Chalhoub thinks that HMC should factor more than just returns into its investments. “We can live with an endowment that's not as robust as we have now, if this comes with more accountability,” he says.
In their advocacy and public forum organizing, Stop Harvard Land Grabs strives for this type head-on reckoning with what Harvard is. The group organizes events, Ghuman explains, “to help students see how this is a business and how it’s a business that functions like many other oppressive socio-economic entities in this country.”
Ghuman explains that Stop Harvard Land Grabs is trying to reframe Harvard so people think of it as a corporation rather than as a school. “It’s a corporation, and one of its arms is a school,” Ghuman says.
Harvard students, specifically, should be troubled by Harvard’s corporate nature, Ghuman thinks. “If Harvard is a business, we are the consumers, the students, that all of its business decisions are justified around,” she says. “One of their public justifications is ‘this is for the students, we’re raising this money for the students; this is what makes our school so great.’”
“Well it’s like okay, well, what if we just don't want this?”
When Chalhoub first began to grasp how HMC’s investments in the Cerrado had unfolded, the investments reminded him of how slaveholding societies in the 18th and 19th centuries worked. “It was exactly the same way of occupying the land, eliminating indigenous populations and rural communities constituted by African descendants who’d escaped slavery by going to the woods,” he says.
Almost a year ago, the University published its 2022 report on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, which investigates Harvard’s role in the history of slavery.
“This contradiction between a symbolic accountability in relation to past injustice and the continuing perpetration of injustices in the present, skirting accountability for its deeds, is not acceptable,” Chalhoub warns. “What are we going to do – wait 100 years and have ‘Harvard's Legacy of Environmental Destruction.’ Is that the title of the report in 100 years?"
An hour and a half into our conversation, a ring cuts through Rocha Frazão’s translation and a new black square rearranges the screen. The camera turns on, and Lopes Ribeiro, the Catholic deacon and land rights defender from Piauí, appears, wearing a white graphic T-shirt and a pair of chunky black headphones. Alves Pessoa and Pereira Mendes immediately break into smiles. “Hi, Altamiran,” Alves Pessoa says.
Lopes Ribeiro waves. “How have you been, Mara?” he asks.
Lopes Ribeiro works with the Comissão Pastoral da Terra, the Catholic organization that helped villagers in Santa Filomena — Mara’s home — secure land titles and is now doing the same for Pereira Mendes and his neighbors in Gilbués.
During our conversation, Lopes Ribeiro lists people we should contact from across the country, recounts incidents of violence in the region, and explains recent business deals between HMC and Brazilian companies. As we listen, we sense that he is Piauí’s go-to person on locals’ issues.
After years of speaking with people affected by farmland purchases in Piauí, Lopes Ribeiro believes that HMC is complicit in the region’s violence. “Harvard hasn’t picked up the axe to cut a tree, but they financed it,” he says. “And they not only financed one group, but many.”
Lopes Ribeiro tells us that when he was a child in Piauí his family and neighbors tended small family farms. They fished from deep rivers, and the forests teemed with animals. But that way of life is gone.
Mendonça believes HMC’s operators “destroyed” some of the land, and that Harvard ought to do something to pay that back. “There was no accountability about the impact that Harvard caused to the communities in the first place,” she says.
“Why didn’t it then, for example, compensate the communities that lost their land or try to, for example, reforest some of the areas or recuperate some of the water?” she asks. “It doesn’t solve the problem if Harvard simply sells the land and gets out of there with the profit.”
Pereira Mendes has his own message for the wealthy farmers who come into these regions. “Be more conscious about deforestation and illegal mining,” he says. “Yes, it does bring growth to certain places, but to our region it doesn’t bring growth, it brings turmoil.”
But to focus only on locals’ vulnerability paints an incomplete picture of our conversation. Pereira Mendes and Alves Pessoa also spoke about their agency and resilience — in building wells, growing food elsewhere, and most of all, organizing with their neighbors for a collective land title.
In the same breath that Alves Pessoa describes losing access to clean water and receiving armed threats, she sums up her way forward. “Nowadays this is how we are living,” she says.
“We had to relearn how to live.”
CORRECTION: April 27, 2023
A previous version of this article stated that after the election of President Jair Bolsonaro deforestation accelerated back up to its 2004 rate and that the area deforested was twice the size of Massachusetts. In fact, after the election of Bolsonaro, deforestation returned to the 2008 rate, and the area deforested was approximately the size of Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public School Committee voted unanimously on Tuesday to adopt a revised fiscal year 2024 budget, while will add additional funding for education paraprofessionals, scaled-up learning time programs, and school improvement budgets at various campuses across the district.
In Tuesday’s special meeting to vote on the $245 million budget, Superintendent Victoria L. Greer said Committee edited the budget to provide an additional $700,000 to continue expanded learning time programs, making up for decreased funding from the federal and state government. The Committee also allocated an additional $60,000 for schools which have student bodies that have higher-than-district-average needs.
“We are very fortunate to have the financial resources and the support from the city,” Greer said. “We also know that our resources and our funds do have limits — they are not unlimited funding.”
The adoption of the budget followed weeks of discussions between the Committee and local parent advocacy groups, including the North Cambridge Courageous Conversations, Cambridge Families of Asian Descent, and Cambridge Families of Color Coalition.
Tina T. Lieu, a CPS parent and part of the leadership team of Cambridge Families of Asian Descent, wrote in a statement that she was “happy” to see that the Greer and the School Committee heard feedback and “made adjustments to the budget in a short time frame.”
“I’m grateful for the school community members that turned out to the forums on short notice and came with the mindset of asking how can we orient our school budget to deliver equitable public education so that every student gets what they need,” she wrote.
Despite the funding increases, budget Co-Chair Rachel B. Weinstein admitted the approved budget still had shortcomings.
“Is this budget perfect? I don't think anyone would say it is,” Weinstein said. “But governing and policymaking almost always require not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Committee members specifically flagged the implementation of the budget as an area for potential improvement, saying the district still needs to make progress on its commitment to equitable learning and achievement.
Committee member Ayesha M. Wilson highlighted the achievement gap of students of color as a systematic failing of the district.
“How do we respond when many of our colleagues across the country are doing a lot more with a whole lot less?” Wilson asked the group. “What does it mean to really put our resources, put our money where our mouth is when we talk about equitable outcomes?”
In her opening remarks, Weinstein said while the budget is a critical part of the Committee’s work, it is “not sufficient for seeing student outcomes change dramatically”.
“It’s important to remember that while the budget is perhaps the most important policy we adopt in a given year, what matters even more is how it’s implemented.” Weinstein said. “And the implementation is the job of everyone, at all levels of CPS.”
Noting the delay in the budgeting process due to additional meetings with Cambridge residents, Weinstein said she is confident the Committee will implement the suggestions made regarding the budget process — such as providing translations of the budget proposal and setting more time for the public to review them — in future proceedings.
“We are really fortunate to live and work in a community that not only thinks and cares deeply about our young people’s education but also brings an equity lens to their advocacy,” Weinstein said.
After the meeting, Lieu wrote she was “encouraged” by the School Committee’s comments on improving the budget process and community involvement.
“Folks are interested in working with the district to improve the process next year to reduce stress on everyone and come up with a yet more equity-centered school budget,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge School Committee voted unanimously on April 4 to support the Thrive Act, a bill in the Massachusetts State Legislature to eliminate the state’s MCAS standardized testing requirement for high school graduation.
MCAS is a state-wide standardized test for third to eighth and 10th grade students required by state and federal laws. Students must earn a passing score for English Language Arts, Mathematics, and one Science and Technology or Engineering subject in order to fulfill the high school graduation requirement.
Massachusetts is one of only eight states to require standardized testing for high school graduation.
Last year, 10 percent of Massachusetts students did not meet the state’s benchmark for math, a figure that was 14 percent for science and engineering and 8 percent for English language arts. Under the current laws, schools with low MCAS scores can face administrative takeover by state authorities.
Graduation requirements would be based on students’ coursework rather than their MCAS scores under the proposed Thrive Act. The act would also implement a “comprehensive support and improvement” system for schools and districts with low MCAS scores, instead of state takeover. The bill would also commission a study to evaluate the current assessment system.
Massachusetts waived MCAS graduation requirement for the class of 2021 and 2022 due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Cambridge Mayor Sambul Siddiqui and the School Committee members expressed their support for the act at the meeting.
School Committee member Alfred B. Fantini, who co-wrote the motion with School Committee member David J. Weinstein and vice chair Rachel B. Weinstein, said that MCAS has always been a “lagging indicator” to measure student performances.
Commenting on iReady— an online learning platform that provides personalized support to students outside of school — Fantini said standardized testing alone is not sufficient to assess student performance.
“You want to have the information readily available when you want to start corrective measures,” Fanitini said. “You can still do tests, and maybe the tests are used for other purposes.”
Siddiqui wrote in a statement to The Crimson that she supports the Thrive Act and looks forward to “learning new ways to assess our schools, students, and school districts from the commission.”
Cambridge Education Association President Dan Monahan said in an interview that the Thrive Act “will reduce the harm” to students who experience anxiety over MCAS.
Under the current system, students have no time limit to complete the MCAS. While the tests are usually conducted in the mornings, Monahan noted that the examination period “often spreads into the afternoon.”
“The effectiveness of school in the afternoon is significantly diminished,” he added.
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School graduate Jamie K. Durant ’26 said MCAS was “the scariest test” he took during high school.
“You’re sort of studying to take the test for the whole year,” Durant said. “After that year is done, you kind of just toss it away, so that felt a little bit arbitrary.”
Anais L. Killian ’26, a CRLS graduate, said she remembered how MCAS took about “three whole days out of the school year.”
“Those days could be spent elsewhere, like learning new material,” Killian said. “That may have been more helpful than having those three days taking the test.”
Monahan said he believes establishing a new assessment system is important for accurately evaluating students’ development.
“What we really need to do is to look at other ways of success,” Monahan said. “Many of our students can be highly successful, but yet not be good test-takers.”
Weinstein, the School Committee vice chair, said that while she is not yet ready to ‘throw MCAS out altogether,” she is glad to see alternatives being developed.
“If a 12th grader doesn’t make it across the graduation stage because they’ve failed MCAS, that’s on us, and not on them,” Weinstein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Authors Akwasi Owusu-Bempah and Tahira Rehmatullah discussed the racial implications of developing cannabis legislation at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Wednesday evening.
The Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum conversation was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad, director of the Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation.
The event, hosted by the IOP and the Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project, was part of their joint “Looking Back, Paying it Forward” speaker series.
Muhammad called the co-authors an “unlikely pair,” with Owusu-Bempah as a former “wannabe cop” who became a criminal justice professor and Rehmatullah as an entrepreneur and “self-described drug dealer.”
The pair combined their disparate experiences to write “Waiting to Inhale: Cannabis Legalization and the Fight for Racial Justice,” a book published this year that details their combined knowledge of how drug law enforcement has enabled the expansion of the criminal justice system.
During the talk, Rehmatullah discussed the historical background and development of stigma around drugs.
“It was a way to control communities, target communities with something that is highly utilized,” Rehmatullah said.
Owusu-Bempah and Rehmatullah compared the documented effects of alcohol versus cannabis. Citing pharmacological research, Rehmatullah stressed the lack of an addictive element in cannabis in comparison to other substances.
“There are studies that have shown that things like coffee and sugar are actually more addictive than cannabis. There still is not a case of anyone overdosing on cannabis,” she said.
The authors also discussed a proposed social equity plan surrounding the legalization of cannabis and other drugs.
Owusu-Bempah and Rehmatullah gave anecdotes of individuals convicted for cannabis sales as well as those who had harnessed their resources to “work with other entrepreneurs to bring them into the industry and help create generational wealth for the communities” in the scope of cannabis distribution.
In an interview prior to the forum, Rehmatullah said cannabis legalization is a “stepping stone” for other drugs like psychedelics.
“There’s a lot of stigma around usage of those substances, even though historically they have been utilized in a wide range similar to cannabis, and the legalization of them not only allows for safe usage, but also federal research,” she said.

Radcliffe fellow Ndubueze L. Mbah, an associate professor of history and global gender studies at the University at Buffalo, discussed the theory and implications of “abolition forgery” in a seminar hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Wednesday.
In the lecture, Mbah — a West African Atlantic historian — defined his core concept of “abolition forgery” as a combination of two interwoven processes. He first discussed the usage of abolition forgery as “the use of free labor discourse to disguise forced labor” in European imperialism in Africa throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.
Later in the lecture, Mbah provided a counterpoint to this definition of abolition forgery, using the term to describe the ways Africans trapped in a system of forced labor faked documents to promote their mobility across the continent.
According to Mbah, his concept of abolition forgery represents a novel historical approach.
“Because historians have situated forced labor, typically, within narratives of imperialism, really a meta narrative of imperialism, they have not paid attention to abolition forgeries, the ideologies that underpin the whole thing,” Mbah said.
Mbah began the webinar by discussing the story of Jampawo, an African British subject who petitioned the British colonial governor in 1900. In his appeal, Jampawo cited the physical punishment he and nine African men endured when they refused to sign a Spanish labor contract that differed significantly from the English language contract they signed at recruitment and constituted terms they deemed to be akin to slavery.
Because of the men’s consent in the initial English language contract, however, the governor determined that “they were not victims of forced labor, but willful beneficiaries of free labor,” Mbah said.
Mbah transitioned from this anecdote describing an instance of coerced contract labor to a discussion of different modes of resistance employed by Africans who experienced similar conditions under British imperialism.
“Africans like Jampawo resisted by voting with their feet, walking away or running away, or by calling out abolition as a hoax,” Mbah said.
Mbah introduced the concept of African hypermobility, through which “coerced migrants challenged the capacity of colonial borders and contracts to keep them within sites of exploitation,” he said.
In contextualizing the need for these exploitative labor contracts, Mbah explained that European imperial officials’ perceptions of African laborers as “too uncivilized for free labor” contributed to the presumed need for what was intended to be transitional forced labor.
Mbah also discussed how the stipulations of forced labor contracts imposed constricting gender hierarchies within these societies. Mbah described how the select granting of freedom papers to men mandated that women and children “belong to a man to then benefit from the protection.”
“It enabled men to claim rights to the labor of women and children,” Mbah said.
According to Mbah, women had to be registered as wives to migrant men in order to leave the country.
Mbah said his current project explores retaliations to these restrictions, namely “the forgery of wifehood and the forgery of motherhood as countersurveillance strategies that women were using to respond to this vitriol.”
To conclude, Mbah gestured toward how the system of forced labor persists in Africa today, yet it “continues to be masked by neoliberal discourses of democracy and of development.”
“For example, African children are forced into labor to produce materials used by Tesla, Apple, Google, Microsoft,” Mbah said. “The so-called greening of Africa, or production of materials for electric energy or clean energy, continues to rely on forced labor that remains invisible.”
Mbah’s talk is a part of Radcliffe’s series of fellows’ presentations. Next Wednesday, Radcliffe Fellow Omer Aziz will present a talk called “Facism in America.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, nearly every Harvard varsity sports home game is televised and streamed on screens around the world — but it wasn’t always this way.
Just 11 years ago, Harvard produced broadcasts for only 12 of its sports teams. Harvard Athletics now broadcasts the home contests of 40 of the school’s 42 varsity teams through networks including ESPN+ and the New England Sports Network. The only exceptions are men’s and women’s golf, due to Harvard’s lack of a home course.
Associate Director of Athletics Imry Halevi, who is responsible for content and strategic communications, has pushed for increases in broadcasting since his arrival at the department in November 2012.
“When I came — again, there was nothing here,” Halevi said. “Our facilities, some of them are newer, some are older, cabling was older and there really wasn’t an infrastructure and so that was a big challenge.”
In April 2018, the Ivy League and ESPN signed a 10-year deal to broadcast 1,100 events annually through ESPN+, an online streaming service, and at least 24 games per year on ESPN’s cable networks.
“ESPN has a linear network and they have certain chunks of time that are available,” Halevi said. “And so they work with the Ivy League and make those decisions also with an eye towards gender equity and sports equity to make sure that we have all our teams — or as many teams as possible — getting that opportunity.”
A separate deal with NESN allows Harvard to broadcast up to 14 games per year.
“We tried to — and succeeded in — spreading out all these games throughout all our seasons and with as much equity as possible between the different sports,” Halevi said.
Halevi said he has had a number of conversations with coaches to understand the “intricacies” of each sport and their unique broadcasting challenges, citing the example of the sailing team.
“The coach sat here and explained it to me multiple times to make sure that I understood so that we can give the camera operators and the drone operators and the commentators the guidance they need to do the coverage well,” Halevi said.
Student athletes have welcomed the broadcasting of their home competitions with gratitude and excitement.
Katie J. Krupa ’26, a forward for the women’s varsity basketball team, said broadcasts of her games have enabled family from back home and internationally to tune in to support her.
“I have family not just from around the country, but also around the world, and the fact that they get to stream my games is just very, very exciting to them,” Krupa said.
With relatives living in the Czech Republic and Hong Kong, Krupa’s friends and family are able to watch her games across several regions and time zones.
“It means a lot to me just because I know I have that support even when they’re not physically here with me in Boston, especially being someone who comes from very far away,” she said.
Ludovico A. “Ludo” Rollo ’25, a member of the men’s soccer team, said there was “no way to overstate” his gratitude for the broadcasts.
Rollo said the broadcasts are a significant benefit for international students, whose families are often unable to see games in person.
“Thanks to a game being streamed through ESPN and the New England Sports Network, they have the ability to at least watch their kid play over the weekend and still share those same emotions that they had growing up, even though they’re a whole ocean away,” he said.
Halevi said broadcasting is “not just pointing a camera,” adding that Harvard Athletics is pursuing an initiative to highlight students’ non-athletic achievements during live commentary.
“We try to encourage our commentators to share that information as well on the air to make sure that people who watch us know, ‘Hey, these are not just amazing athletes, but they’re also amazing students,’” he added.

A student petition calling on Harvard administrators to designate federal Election Day a University-wide holiday has garnered more than 380 signatures as of Wednesday night.
The petition, spearheaded by the Institute of Politics’ Harvard Votes Challenge and endorsed by 15 student organizations, urges Harvard leadership to create a “University-wide academic holiday and day of civic action” called “Democracy Day.” Its first installment would be November 5, 2024 — the next federal election date.
The petition marks students’ second endeavor to address what they describe as “civic disengagement” at Harvard. In 2021, a similar petition to launch Democracy Day at Harvard obtained roughly 2,000 signatures.
Harvard Votes Challenge petition leader Jonah B. Simon ’26 said he believes there is a heightened sense of urgency around civic engagement, despite the 2023 petition receiving far fewer signatures than the 2021 effort as of Wednesday evening.
“There have been several states across the country that have either introduced legislation for abridging voting rights and making it more challenging for people to vote, that’s things like voter ID laws and restricting early voting,” Simon said.
“We think that the stakes are a lot higher now, and so it feels much more urgent to me to make this happen now,” he added.
Students initiated the position in response to a statistic that found 29.4 percent of all eligible Harvard students did not cast ballots during the 2020 presidential election, in comparison to 31.6 percent of eligible Boston voters.
On average, in colleges across the nation, around 34 percent of eligible students did not vote in the election, according to a Tufts study.
Simon said he believes Harvard is “behind in the Ivy League” in designating Election Day as a holiday.
Currently, Columbia, Brown and Stanford have designated Election Day a holiday. Yale and Princeton students have launched petitions for the day off, though they failed to gain traction with their respective administrations.
If the initiative is adopted by Harvard, Democracy Day would include programming such as youth athletic clinics where parents can drop off children while voting and a student-run hotline to answer election questions.
“No other university has proposed anything on the scope of what we’re pushing for, which is, first of all, University-wide. Second of all, applies not just to students but to staff in some capacity,” Simon said.
A Democracy Day concept paper prepared by Simon and presented alongside the petition criticized Harvard as “failing to live up to its reputation as a global leader in civic education and thought.”
“Harvard is failing to offer students the necessary resources and motivation to become civically active, and is thus falling short of its stated mission,” the paper reads.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the campaign and referred The Crimson to a September 2022 statement by University President Lawrence S. Bacow encouraging civic action.
“If you are eligible to vote, I encourage you to visit the nonpartisan Harvard Votes Challenge website,” Bacow wrote in September.
Though IOP staff supports students in their efforts to increase civic engagement on campus, the IOP does not endorse specific campaigns.
Currently the Democracy Day petition has 340 signatures from students at the College and fewer than 30 signatures from students at Harvard’s other schools.
Simon said petition organizers are open to changes that apply only to the College, as opposed to the originally proposed University-wide changes.
“Right now we are pushing for a University-wide day of civic action, but whatever we can do to expand our impact, whatever we can do counts and matters,” he added.

Allston-Brighton residents said they are looking forward to the arrival of the award-winning American Repertory Theater at 175 North Harvard St., part of a new Harvard development that will also offer housing for affiliates.
The plans for the development were originally approved in 2013, with the intent to redevelop the site with a new basketball venue and a mixed-use institutional development focusing on student housing.
Since then, Lavietes Basketball Pavilion has undergone renovations to improve the existing location, which gave way to the amended plans, filed Nov. 30 of last year, proposing to relocate the A.R.T. to Allston instead. Harvard’s new proposal still requires BPDA approval before construction can get underway.
The updated proposal also mentions a residential building of approximately 276,000 square feet, containing a total of 264 units and 480 beds. The proposed development will also boast a gym, a resident lounge, study rooms, and a residential courtyard.
Barbara M. Parmenter, an Allston-Brighton resident and a current Harvard-Allston Task Force member, said she was excited for the development and the new housing it will bring.
“I feel like we need a lot more housing in our neighborhood and in our city and our state in general,” Parmenter said.
The project also proposes a relocation of a nearby Bluebikes station and a renovation of the bus stop located in front of the proposed development site near Barry’s Corner.
Another focal point of the project is the relocation of the A.R.T., which was first founded in 1980 and has been residing at the Loeb Drama Center — a building constructed in 1960 – on Brattle Street ever since.
The new location for the A.R.T. will consist of a building of approximately 68,000 square feet and will contain two performance theaters with a combined total of 1,000 seats. The new location will also offer an outdoor performance yard, rehearsal spaces, and studio areas.
According to an announcement by the A.R.T. in 2019, “internationally renowned” architects from Haworth Tompkins are set to design their future Allston home, which will be the first building designed by this firm in the United States.
The proposed plan follows a $100 million gift to Harvard from hedge fund manager David E. Goel ’93 and Stacy L. Goel in 2019, for the purpose of a new “arts and research performance space in Allston”.
Parmenter said she believes this project will help contribute to the arts culture in the area.
“I think one of the things the task force made clear was this can be such a great contribution to really making Barry’s Corner a kind of go-to location for arts and culture,” she said, referring to the Harvard-Allston Task Force.
Tim McHale, Brighton resident and HATF member, said the arts are a “great engine to transform any neighborhood.”
McHale added he hopes the A.R.T. will be an “architectural masterpiece.”
“I think the building needs to show itself off,” McHale said.
Mary-Helen Black, an Allston resident, said the A.R.T. will serve as an “anchor” for the neighborhood.
“I think it’s going to be positive. I think it’s going to help the local restaurants, the coffee shops that are around there,” Black said. “It’s going to create more of a destination, which is great.”
Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa said the relocation of the A.R.T. at 175 North Harvard Street will further enliven the Allston-Brighton neighborhood.
“175 North Harvard St. will be an innovative new home for the A.R.T, and its globally renowned theater, which will build on the established and flourishing arts culture in Allston,” Kamosa said.
“It will also create needed housing for Harvard students and affiliates, as well as a lively streetscape and publicly accessible open space, which will help add vibrancy to an already thriving neighborhood,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is now $300 million richer, and its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has taken a new name — that of billionaire hedge fund CEO and Republican megadonor Kenneth C. Griffin ’89. Not everyone is thrilled.
Following University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s Tuesday announcement of Griffin’s unrestricted donation to FAS, some students and faculty celebrated the donation, while others blasted his support of Republican political candidates.
Griffin gave nearly $60 million to Republicans in the 2022 election cycle and has publicly backed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024. DeSantis has not announced a presidential bid.
Griffin has also given to some Democratic politicians and donated $500,000 to President Joe Biden’s inaugural committee.
In total, Griffin has given more than half a billion dollars to Harvard, including a 2014 donation of $150 million largely to bolster financial aid at Harvard College. The College’s financial aid office was renamed after Griffin following the donation.
Theda R. Skocpol, a Government and Sociology professor and former GSAS dean, slammed the decision in an email to The Crimson.
“I am absolutely disgusted at the sale of the GSAS name to a multi billionaire who works in US politics today to undermine the foundations of liberal civil society, including free speech, and to eviscerate the essential trans partisan features of fully representative US democracy,” she wrote.
“This is a shocking and unnecessary sell out by Harvard and FAS leaders who, at the same time, claim to be worried about Harvard College’s acceptance of slavery in the 1700s,” Skocpol added. “Feel free to quote me.”
In a statement, Jaquelyn M. Scharnick ’06, a spokesperson for Griffin and a former Crimson News editor, called Griffin “one of the strongest supporters of free speech and free inquiry in the country.”
“Ken said as recently as today that no one who contributes to a politician agrees 100% with their views and policy positions,” Scharnick wrote. “This is as true for Ken’s financial support of Governor DeSantis as it was for his backing of the campaigns of President Obama and Mayor Rahm Emanuel.”
In 2022, DeSantis signed a state law — widely known as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — forbidding kindergarten to third-grade public school classrooms from teaching about sexual orientation and gender. DeSantis has proposed expanding the ban to all age levels. He has also spoken out against children attending drag performances and gender-affirming health care for transgender minors as he prepares for a likely presidential run.
Griffin has publicly endorsed the “Don’t Say Gay” law, calling DeSantis’ move “a really important point of view,” per Forbes.
Ericka R. “Ricky” Sanchez, a Ph.D. candidate in English, said Griffin’s endorsement of DeSantis shows “disdain” for queer people such as herself.
“It does feel quite antithetical to name this institution, or this part of the institution, after somebody who is so hostile to the survival of the people who make up the school,” she said.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment and referred The Crimson to the official announcement in The Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication. The Gazette article does not mention Griffin’s political views or activities.
In the Gazette, Bacow praised Griffin’s “exceptional generosity and steadfast devotion,” adding that he appreciates “the confidence he has placed in us — and in our mission — to do good in the world.”
“His choice to support FAS underscores the power of education to transform lives and to expand the reach of our research in every field imaginable,” Bacow said.
Still, third-year Harvard Law School student Ash E. Tomaszewski said Harvard should have refused to accept the donation because of Griffin’s political contributions, adding that they were “disgusted” but “not surprised.”
When it comes to funding, however, some argued that a potential donor’s political background should not come into the picture.
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw wrote in an email that Harvard “should not judge the political views of its donors,” adding that he was “very grateful for Mr. Griffin’s generosity.”
Zad Chin ’24 said she was “glad” that Griffin had donated to the school, saying his political views should be “independent” of his giving to the school.
She said if somebody is “generous enough to donate money to the school, I don’t see why we should not accept the money from him.”
Laughing, she said that the flag outside Lehman Hall, which houses the GSAS student center, was changed to include Griffin’s name “like, one second after the announcement.”
Griffin is the third donor in the last nine years whose donation has renamed a Harvard school. In 2014, billionaire Gerald L. Chan’s Morningside Foundation donated $350 million to Harvard’s School of Public Health, which was renamed after his father T.H. Chan. The following year, Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences was renamed for hedge fund billionaire John A. Paulson after a $400 million donation.
The University has not historically renamed schools for donors. The last time before 2014 was in 1638, when John Harvard’s donation led to a renaming of the University.
Lorenzo J.F. McClellan, a Ph.D. candidate in History, felt Griffin’s donation was “probably driven by vanity and a desire to see his name on a major Harvard institution,” adding that he “cannot imagine having $300 million to give to a charity and deciding that Harvard University was the scrappy institution in need of more money.”
“It would be great if they topped up my stipend,” McClellan said of Harvard’s new unrestricted funds.
Tomaszewski said they and Harvard’s graduate student union would advocate for the funds to directly benefit graduate students and other staff, but felt pessimistic about this coming to fruition.
“We have to beg and beg and beg for pennies,” they said.
Other affiliates said they appreciated the donation.
“I presume that the GSAS — which is very, very hard to raise funds for — will be a major beneficiary,” Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former dean of Harvard College said. “I am perfectly happy to have Mr. Griffin honored by that renaming.”
Citing recent donations to science and engineering initiatives at Harvard, Lewis celebrated the fact that the arts and humanities will also benefit from Griffin’s gift.
Still, while Lewis is not concerned with Griffin’s political activism, he hopes the school will support teaching and research rather than “administrative bloat.”
“I would hate to see it used to pay administrative salaries that might have been eliminated if some belt-tightening had been necessary,” Lewis wrote in a follow-up email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 70 Cambridge residents and activists gathered in front of Cambridge City Hall Wednesday afternoon in support of Cambridge Green New Deal policies that would mandate emissions reductions from large commercial buildings.
The protesters — including student activists, environmentalists, local organizers, business owners, and Cambridge residents — rallied 30 minutes prior to a meeting of the Cambridge City Council’s Ordinance Committee, which was set to discuss proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance.
The proposed BEUDO amendments would require large commercial buildings to gradually reduce emissions until 2035, when buildings subject to the amendments would be required to reach net zero emissions. Owners of buildings that miss their emissions targets would be required to pay a compliance fee.
The protest was co-sponsored by nine local and university organizations, including the Harvard Climate Coalition and Harvard Undergraduate Clean Energy Group.
Natalia S. George, a member of Sunrise Cambridge and a sophomore at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, spoke at the rally and called for the city to take decisive action on climate change.
“I fight for a livable future not only so people in years to come will have a healthy planet to live on, but also so people living right now have a bright future to look forward to. I believe that empathy is a core value of climate justice,” George said.
George said in an interview after the rally that she was glad many young activists turned out to support the amendments.
“I think it’s really good that more young people are getting out there to spread their opinions about it because a lot of people we see in government are on the older side,” George said. “Rallies like this are really good at getting the opinions of people who might otherwise be silenced in government.”
Climate activist Elana Sulakshana urged those who attended the protest to join the committee meeting and give public comment “in support of strong and equitable amendments” to BEUDO.
“You can talk about why a Green New Deal matters to you — why you’re afraid of climate change, why you’re calling for action, how your community’s impacted,” she said in her speech.
“We need policy that mandates them to cut emissions by 2035 — not 2050 or beyond,” Sulakshana added. “And we can’t exempt some of the big buildings in this city because they’re ‘historical sites’ or ‘they’re not big enough,’ we need to be tackling all of the large commercial buildings across Cambridge. ”
Emily Mockler, a member of Sunrise Cambridge who helped organize Wednesday’s rally, said in an interview after the event that she wanted residents’ voices heard over “all the large corporations that are probably going to be speaking,” adding that she hopes the amendments will “inspire other towns across the country.”
“It’s been rare that a municipality has actually written concrete laws that will force buildings to go to net zero.” Mockler said. “I was super excited to see Quinton Zondervan and other council members writing something so important that would have such a huge impact.”
Somerville resident Amber Houghstow, who was present at the rally, said she planned to attend the city council meeting to provide public comment about how the “carbon credit market is not working,” referencing the practice of purchasing carbon offsets instead of reducing emissions.
“People have been buying carbon credits, but they’re not actually getting carbon back into the soil,” Houghstow said.
“That has really profound implications for some of the changes that have been made in the last round of edits to this, which basically implies it’ll make this draft as it is now pretty ineffective,” she said of the amendments.
Steven E. Miller, a member of climate justice group 350 Massachusetts, said he supports the policies because of the impact climate change will have on his grandchildren.
“I came here because I now have grandchildren and I realized very intimately that the world will not be there for them, right?” said Miller. “So I feel it’s my responsibility to help do what I can to keep that from happening.”

Dear Seniors,
As Harvard spray paints the Yard green once again to schmooze the Class of 2027, our own class seems to have moved firmly into an era of excitement and festivity. The time until graduation, now fewer than 50 days, continues to shrink — and so does lecture attendance. Unlike in years past, this spring brought us thesis photoshoots, freshman roommate reunions, and one last chance to romance longtime crushes. It’s a time of popping champagne and posting detailed LinkedIn updates, of reveling in the paradox of being simultaneously young to the world and wise elders in the eyes of underclassmen. While this space for celebration is certainly well-deserved, I also want to carve out a bit of space for something else: uncertainty.
Four or five years ago, we were at a similar point of transition, saying goodbye to our classmates and teachers as we donned caps and gowns. For most of us, the path was crystal clear by April. We knew we would be moving to Cambridge, living in age-old dorms, and spending the next four years diving headfirst into a liberal arts education. Those who didn’t yet know Harvard was in their future were likely still certain higher education would be their next step. This time, though, the arrival of Commencement means we begin charting our own paths, and finding the right direction is not as straightforward.
Of course, there are those among us who just buzz with anticipation for the fellowship or graduate school program or finance job they have lined up. But I promise more seniors than you might expect are still trying to figure it all out, whether that means looking for a job or deciding between offers or searching desperately for the right housing, the right roommate, the right way to maintain a relationship when “long-distance” comes to mean across the country instead of from the river to the Quad. There are so many decisions to be made right now, so many logistics to iron out, and there’s no guarantee that the grass will be greener on the other side — even a spray-painted green a la Harvard Yard.
Moving from college to the real world can feel like running full speed around a corner with nothing but the hope you won’t crash immediately. “You’re a small fish in a big pond,” they told us when we got here freshman year. Now the pond is about to grow infinitely bigger, and if you’re not fully content with your plans or rock-solid in your optimism, you may be left wondering, “Am I doomed to the life of a smaller and smaller fish? Did I work this hard just to be swallowed up in a sea already brimming with near-replicas of me and my accomplishments?” Four years of college and plenty of knowledge, just to be swept aside, unseasoned, like a plate of Red’s Best Catch in the dining hall tray return. That can’t be right.
It can be demoralizing to hold onto this uncertainty when it seems like everyone else is cruising down the collegiate home stretch. It can be even harder to admit it exists, pushing back against the fear of judgment or the worry of detracting from someone else’s well-earned spirit of celebration. But “semper veritas” requires a commitment to even the scariest of truths, and the truth is that change is uncomfortable and difficult to navigate.
So maybe some of us will take a bit longer to work out exactly what life will be like post-college, and maybe I will keep looking like a deer caught in headlights whenever a well-meaning underclassman starts asking for specifics. That’s just the name of the game. Before we know it, the Yard will finally have its real summer grass again, and we’ll all be on our way, figuring it out as we go.
