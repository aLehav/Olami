By sixth grade, the average American child has seen 8,000 murders on television. I imagine the statistic is similar in Spain, where I grew up, and where the average person spends four hours in front of the TV. But not in my house.
That’s the only rule I remember from my childhood: no TV. It was less of an instruction and more of a general aura that hung around our home, since we didn’t even own a set. It wasn’t up for discussion: TV was a waste of time, and we were never going to buy one. So logically, it followed that we would never have cable or own a Wii.
Naturally, my sister and I wanted all those things with a deep desire. I remember nodding blankly at conversations about “El Internado” and “Águila Roja,” the series that were popular in my primary school years. It took me ages to figure out what “Gran Hermano” (“Big Brother”) was. I barely understand what it is today, since I’ve never watched it.
Today, thanks to Netflix and other online streaming services, I’m in tune with what others are watching. But there are still huge gaps in my knowledge of the media I never consumed as a child. Any references from children’s films go way over my head. Americans are especially attached to Disney, and seem incredulous when I don’t respond to their quotes from “Pocahontas” or “The Lion King.”
Most people feel pity for the apparent cultural void I grew up in, but, ironically, it was quite the opposite. My parents love film (on their first date they went to see the 1931 version of “Frankenstein”) and always felt that they should educate their daughters accordingly. They exposed us to classics like “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial” and Studio Ghibli animation. We were the ones who didn’t receive them well. Rather, we never made it past the first five minutes of these films.
The opening scene of “E.T.” was enough to make us scream in terror. If you don’t know what I’m referring to, it’s because there’s nothing scary about it. The dark wood where the extraterrestrial first appears was too much for us to bear. That tall, gloomy forest was full of menace, and we didn’t want to find out what lay beyond it, or for that matter, what happened in the following scenes.
Similar scenarios played out during “The Lion King” and a film adaptation of “Tin Tin,” which we tolerated in comic book format. So, you can imagine the effect of truly traumatic films. After seeing “The Boy in the Striped Pajamas” at a friend’s house, where it would’ve been embarrassing to ask her to turn off the TV, I lost sleep for a week. Another time, I walked by my uncle’s monitor where he was watching something about the Zodiac Killer. The image of a dead woman tied to a tree is still burned in my mind.
My sister and I were never exposed to those 8,000 murders, which in turn made us reluctant to see anything similar. It was a cycle that kept us sheltered, but also preserved our emotional sensitivity. Even now, we close our eyes and clutch each other’s hands when there’s a suspenseful scene in “Criminal Minds.”
Does (still) not having a TV make us privileged in a time when most people complain that we spend too much time glued to screens? It’s more complicated than that. Whenever people come over to our house, they remark how lucky we are to not have a TV, and then go home to watch theirs. Surprisingly, my dad is now looking into installing a projector in our living room, so that we can watch movies as a family. Even he recognizes that there is a need for some kind of in-home screening.
Now that I’m growing older, I often ask myself if I would raise my future children the same way. And I’ve decided that my future home will have a TV. It may have educational drawbacks, but I want my kids to feel they belong among their peers.

Tattered, worn, and showing clear signs of being read too much is my copy of “A Light in the Attic” by Shel Silverstein. It sits, nestled between writings of Elizabeth Bishop and Li-Young Lee. The funny rhymes and silly ideas once drew me in, and I carried around my journals, paper cut and stapled together. I no longer know where those relics are, but I do know that I haven’t really ever stopped writing. Yet it didn’t really begin with writing, but rather reading. And, before there was reading, there was the learning of plain (and, for me, not so simple) English.
In kindergarten during recess, I would yearn to be with my friends on the playground playing tag or baseball. Instead, I had to take an English as a Second Language (ESL) class during this time. Despite the fact that my parents spoke English fluently, they insisted I keep my mother tongue; and just as importantly, my grandparents, who knew only Mandarin, visited frequently from China. I can still remember my frustration and anger when my parents told me they didn’t understand me whenever English tumbled out of my mouth. Every day, I would practice my pronunciation to distinguish the hard t from the softer d, complete exercises on how to sound out words, and memorize new vocabulary.
With English, doors to worlds were opened in the most predictable manner: books. While I still had trouble pronouncing words, I was able to understand and acutely grasp what I was reading. When devouring books, I stumbled across “A Light in the Attic,” and I tore through it as I did with other books. However, after closing the book, I reopened it to reread, an occurrence that rarely happened. Afterwards, I read all of Shel Silverstein’s books and truly delved into poetry. It was through this medium that I felt that I was truly an active participant in the writing. Sometime soon after reading “A Light in the Attic,” I started writing poems myself.
Poetry, uniquely, is able to convey a vessel of emotion. There is careful precision in each syllable, each word weighted delicately, every perspective considered—an idea translatable into life itself. Even after years of writing poetry and prose, I cannot forget the struggles I had, and sometimes still do have, with English. I fear reading aloud and tripping over foreign vocabulary, or revealing my inability to say “specific” properly with the hard c, or mispronouncing other words. Through writing, I am able to convey myself eloquently without speaking.
At the same time, my experiences bleed through in my writing because they shape who I am. A combination of ESL classes, Silverstein’s influence, and my love of words lend themselves to the following poem. In retrospect: I am grateful for my fluent Mandarin, you probably couldn’t guess which words I could stumble upon, and English is a language I do not take for granted.
Regardless of Translation
Puckering lips to unpluck the sound of
your native tongue. Thick as blood. 
Detained at the border. Discarded in storm sewers.
Discovering this touch of tip to teeth.
Hardening from looping vowels, untranslated 
promises, a chamber of echoes vibrates  
between your uvula. It’s a riddle, hanging,
so sophisticated, thought to be useless,
constant evolution of need and want. 
Wanting to constantly mature, change, 
ecdysis—approximately every decade 
for cicadas. Exoskeletons crisply caving
into chest. Ribs do not splinter. An image
haunting. I wonder if their hearts squeeze. 
Scientists cannot replicate frequency, wavelength
amplitude. To you, neither can I. This present
should not have been mine for the taking. 
Take the way cicadas scrieve wings
slicing morning haze. The way they mark home,
sound shivering through tymbal, muscle,
organ. The way I clench syllables too tight.
The way my face contours upon hearing 
remnants of your voice. The way my heart
wrings—I throw away the knowing why.

“Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail.” —Ralph Waldo Emerson.
In third grade, I filled a fat Microsoft Word document with dozens of little chunks of wisdom similar to the above quote, printed them all out in size 48 Apple Chancery font, and scotch-taped them haphazardly across all four walls of my bedroom.
“Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you have imagined,” Henry David Thoreau said once. That one sounds like it came straight off BrainyQuote.com, perhaps the product of curiously Google searching “inspiring quotes.” If there were a way to trace my third grade search history (which there probably is, frighteningly enough), it would be a scattering  of:
quotes about life
quotes about motivation
wise quotes
motivational quotes
quotes about growing up
quotes
I hung these quotes on my walls and reread them day after day. They stared at me when I awoke and were the last things I saw as I fell asleep. They are seared into my memory.
I don’t remember where I found most of the quotes I collected, but I do know that it wasn’t by reading any complete essays by Emerson or Thoreau. Rather, at that age, I was under the distinct impression that quotes like these stood alone as concise, uplifting compositions. Accordingly, my professional aspiration was to become a quote-writer. I pictured myself old, poised with a fountain pen, being struck with inspiration and penning quote after sage quote—each immediately ready for publication on the online market, to meet the demand of eager young fans waiting to convert my words to Apple Chancery for display.
(I now realize this is not the way the quote market typically circulates. There is no straight shot to BrainyQuote.com. Even more mystifying is the road to the prestigious status of having your wise words superimposed onto a sunset or wheat field and becoming a top hit on Google Images.)
In trying to process why my nine-year-old self was so eager to devour and display these quotes, I recall that it was around this age that I was becoming frustrated with children’s literature. My little brother was still deep in the thick of “Rainbow Fish,” Disney, “The Quiltmaker's Gift,” Patricia Polacco, and the like. But at this age, I was getting impatient.
Children’s books are always trying to impart wisdom in creative and covert ways, through little parables. “Rainbow Fish” lures you in with mesmerizing illustrations of silver scales, and then before you know it, you’ve absorbed a crucial lesson about embracing your individuality. The young Goldilocks, despite being a rogue individual out of touch with all social and legal norms against Unlawful Entry, stumbles upon the perennial importance of seeking balance and avoiding extremes. Her story may be a coded endorsement of centrism, propagated by the political establishment. More likely, it is like so many other children’s books and stories in that it takes a kernel of real-life wisdom and gets children to digest it like a pill hidden in a spoonful of peanut butter. (This is how we medicate our dog. It is very effective.)
Of course, these stories are not maliciously deceptive. But I think I hit an age where I began to feel babied. Duped. I wanted to cut to the chase. I wanted my life lessons raw, concise, and unadorned, and I did not want to be slipped truisms when all I had expected was entertainment. I wanted this wisdom because I asked for it—because I quite literally opened up Google and asked for it on no uncertain terms—not because some adult was pulling off sneaky, well-intentioned indoctrination. And I did not want to wait through a familiar and unsophisticated plotline to get to it.
Most children hit that point where children’s books begin to seem below them. Predictable. Cliché. Maybe it’s usually less about feeling deceived, and more about feeling bored, but it’s fairly universal. As we age, we seek fiction that enlightens us in increasingly subtle ways. We want our redemptive lesson buried ever-deeper, in ever-larger hunks of peanut butter. We want it there, but we want it so expertly disguised that it takes a seminar-style English course at least two class periods long to decode.
With age, we also sometimes develop a visceral antagonism to cliché. We turn up our noses, our moral intelligence insulted, if “adult” fiction resembles the sorts of tidy childish parables we used to love. Fiction must be profoundly original if it is to be of value, and it must assume that we have already internalized all the level-one life lessons long ago.
From an entertainment perspective, this is fair. While there tends to be a lower bar to capturing children’s attention, I guess we require increasingly powerful forces to capture our frenetic attention as we get older. But as we become averse to cliché, and appreciate the subtle and the innovative, I think we can overestimate ourselves pretty quickly.
Children’s literature and the messages it conveys are cliché. Banal, conventional wisdom. But as we outgrow it, we risk conflating the simple and unoriginal—but most fundamental and profound—with the juvenile.
You have likely read your favorite children’s book dozens of times, but the same is less likely the case with your favorite novel. The fact that children reread, and love to reread, suggests that they are after something quite different from what adults are after when they read fiction. As we get older we want to be entertained with novelty. We want fiction to reveal. Children are content for it to merely—but crucially—remind.
Thinking back to my retirement from nightly storytimes and my obsession with inspiring quotes, I am convinced these simultaneous events were interrelated. You could say I was lost and empty, feverishly dredging through Google to find the inspiration I missed and craved. But my quotes allowed me to eschew the juvenile plot lines I had grown bored with without giving up either the simple, redeeming lessons they conveyed or their presence in my daily life.
I think at that point, while I may have misunderstood what a “quote” fundamentally was, on some level I must have understood just how much I was losing when I was giving up storytime—and grasped that there was an element I needed, and would always need, to preserve.
One of my favorite writers, David Foster Wallace, gave a commencement address that I love, called “This is Water.” It opens with a parable: Two fish are swimming along and come to a metaphysical realization about water. Wallace then goes on to explain, “The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about… On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables—the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.”
Nightly storytime can do just this. It’s a routine I was lucky enough to enjoy as a child, and have come to appreciate not just for its studied benefits to literacy and brain development, but for its humble and ritualistic reminders of what is simple, important, and too-easily-forgotten.
Clichés still ruffle my feathers. I am paranoid about sounding cliché in this very moment. But I think that this paranoia might be rooted in a latent urge to prove I am a Big Kid, and I hope one day to feel Big Enough that I welcome back the warm fuzziness of cliché with wide open arms. Hopefully by the time I break “Rainbow Fish” back out for my own children, I will have nothing left to prove, and will relish its familiar profundity each and every evening.

Scattered across the backyard, my siblings and I scoured below rocks, uprooted daffodils, and searched behind trees for Pokemon potentially hidden out in the tall grass. Examining the base of one such tree, I discovered a hole burrowed in the wood. Excitedly, I waved my younger brother over to check out the find. Even with his expertise, we were unable to coax any of the prized creatures out of the aperture, and a few minutes later, we had abandoned the sapling to continue our grand exploration.
Many years later when I consider the memory, I shake my head at the naivety of my younger self. I consider with amusement how I must have sounded to my parents as I explained over dinner the significance of the find and shared my eagerness in checking out the location once more in the coming days.
Sometimes, I wonder why my parents didn’t shatter my illusions right then and there. I imagine how easily they could have explained to me in a cool voice that Pokemon and Pokeballs and Ash Ketchum simply didn’t exist. Rather, sharing a knowing smile between themselves, they allowed us to scurry off to our Gameboys where we would spend the better part of the evening exploring our imaginations vigorously through our conversations and our digital adventures.
As a writer, I can now appreciate my parents’ wisdom in refusing to disrupt these childish illusions and rather allowing time to peel them away. The same boy who as a child could easily be whisked off to London when reading “Oliver Twist,” and then Portland, Oregon an hour later with “Ramona the Pest,” now struggles to ignite his imagination in the ways he once so easily could. I’ve come to believe this alteration can be credited in a part to a degree of faith that I’ve lost in the world around me as I’ve grown.
As a child, I could believe that the world of Nemo and Buzz Lightyear was really no different from our own. Sheltered, I had no idea of the world that existed beyond my doorstep, one ravaged by inequality and conflicts that my puerile mind could not even begin to understand. I could believe then that a little boy like me could rise up and prevail against any challenge as long as I believed in myself like the Sunday morning cartoons promised.
As I went from watching Cartoon Network to CNN, I learned of the gospels of disenfranchisement that ruled cities near and far from me. These realities began to dispel the innocence that had cloaked me. I began to see that the heroes of my childhood—Santa Claus, Spongebob, and Samurai Jack—were merely a fiction after all.
Now, it would be easy to say that this loss of innocence was for the best, an inevitable part of maturation. I was merely buckling up my trousers and embracing my place in adult life. However, in growing up, we lose something important as well. We begin to forget the spark that had once ignited those childhood adventures. The one that allowed us to marvel at the beauty in common things and to take joy in the most mundane aspects of the world we occupy.
When I took organic chemistry, I learned about Louis Pasteur, who discovered chirality, one of the most fundamental concepts of the subject, at 24. For some reason, his story stuck with me and led me to ponder this question: Why was it that, so often, younger scientists, musicians, politicians and artists dreamed up or catalyzed innovations in their respective communities, sometimes with little to no life experience?
After some thought, I concluded perhaps it was due to the dearth of experience itself. Maybe, as they had not yet fully grown up, they weren’t yet imprisoned by their knowledge, jaded by their rationality, and still nurtured the childish spark that might lead them to question the world we stubbornly insist we know so well.
I’m turning nineteen soon and my birthday wish is to recapture the mindset I had when I was nine. Perhaps not the one who looked for charmanders in the backyard grass, but certainly the one who saw President Barack Obama climbing the White House stairs in 2009 and put down my gameboy to inform my grandmother that one day that would be me.

Some decisions in life seem insignificant at first. Maybe you caught a train 10 minutes later than your usual time because you were running late. Maybe you decided to take the longer route home one evening just because. In the moment, these whimsical actions are negligible seconds that tick by, like grains of sand that graze past your ankles in the ocean waves. Given enough time, however, the grains can flow and flow until one day, you find your feet completely buried in the sand and unable to move.
My first grains came to me as webcomics during the last years of my childhood when the first years of adolescence were just peeking above the horizon. I stumbled upon my first webcomic almost serendipitously. As a child raised by the Internet, I had grown bored of my usual websites and was hunting the infinite web for something new. Back then, I had simply begun reading as a way to pass time, but my curiosity gripped the comic with a childish tenacity that eventually fueled an eager obsession with webcomics as a whole. Pretty soon, I was reading multiple comics, juggling the plotlines and characters based on an orderly schedule of chapter updates. “Todd Allison and the Petunia Violet” was a dark mystery riddled with government corruption and a beautifully diverse range of characters. “Cucumber Quest,” on the other hand, was a lighthearted adventure tale set in a food-themed universe. It was like the gospel for me. I loved them all.
Even better, my digital discovery occurred at a time when I still had the one-track dedication of a child. When I wasn’t reading webcomics, I was doodling the characters on the margins of notebooks and enthusiastically discussing them on online forums. My fascination with the individual artistic styles of each webcomic served as inspiration for my own artistic endeavours. Once I received my first drawing tablet on my eleventh birthday, it was like taking gum off of a shoe, for I would rarely leave whatever painting I was working on.
Looking back, I realize that my obsession with webcomics stemmed less from the comics themselves than from the creative awakening they sparked inside my young heart. One’s childhood marks the formative years of development, after all, and any interest that captures the curiosity of a child has the potential to radically shape the trajectory of his or her future. I devoured my webcomics as an active reader. Not only did I fall in love with the characters and storylines, but I also paid close attention to the formatting of the page, the nuanced differences in dialogue that molded each character to be his own, and the meticulous details that made each story so rich. What was subconscious then but is so glaringly obvious now is the question that pounded inside me as my eyes darted across each page: Can I create something like this, too?
Today, webcomics are a closed chapter of my life, but they stirred a passion for storytelling and art that will never quite leave me. I don’t think that I would have become who I am today had I discovered webcomics last week or even a year ago. As I have come to appreciate, art and childhood go together like the milk and cookies that we once left out for Santa Claus. With the creativity of art, children can express their hyperactive imagination in ways that coax out our best and inspire us to carve out our own paths in life. Even now, painting and crafting fictional worlds inside my head isn’t possible if I don’t tap into my inner child.
In retrospect, discovering that webcomic was no accident. Although I don’t know the exact moment when the impact of that decision began to weave its way into every aspect of my life, I do know that the waves had been licking at my ankles long before, the grains of sand pooling over my feet.

I had the privilege of watching the Mako mermaids' passionate arguments and teenagerhood mixed with magic as a child. I did not know they lived in Australia—they never mentioned it, and the places they visited were so obviously (not to me back then) childhood fantasy-inspired that I never questioned or mused about their homeland. It was just a place, the Mako island, where they had a bizarre, mercurial volcano. As a child watching a children’s show, I did not put much thought into the production value or details.
Although “H20: Just Add Water” was and is an atrocious show—I cannot remember any interesting storylines or any logical plot points—I still know the characters well and can recall the girls’ chemistry and their beautiful mermaid tails. Until I was 12, every time I washed my dishes, I too worried about flapping on the floor with a tail that I did not have. I imagined the powers I would get after I myself dipped into the Mako pool of magic. I wanted all their abilities, to freeze and burn and move and control and jellify (the horrid result of the show’s later seasons) water, but in my mind, I would remain a gracious friend, albeit too powerful for her own good. Their actions and behavior, obviously and drastically affected by their powers, no doubt would have been the same as mine, if I had a chance to participate in that world.
And boy, was that world colorful. School was not daunting, there was no bullying, and the friendships between the girls were strong, unmarred by competition or jealousy or outside forces, such as paranoid grandmothers, jealous mothers, or lacking social skills on the girls’ part. After school, miraculously unaffected by the sun, they would bike to a café that could only exist on a set—a tiki hut with piss colored floors and not a speck of dirt, tables littered with foamy, pearly milkshakes, gorgeous, crimson virgin cherries on their glass brims. The perfect place for a teenage girl to worship from afar. And yet I did not.
I do not think the showrunners thought this through, but the world was a bit too much. It was too beautiful, too colorful—the water was toxic turquoise and the tails were salamander-skin-orange. And the girls themselves were too beautiful, their lashes too long and dark, their skin too unblemished, too unfreckled, too white. Alienation was not the showrunners’ intent, but they did it marvelously, and when I watched the mermaids splash around and cut through the water with their curvy tails, I did not want to join them. I was in a cramped bedroom, with lime green and pale-yellow wallpaper peeling around me and books stuffed inside boxes, all stacked on top of each other. It was the summer, and I had gone home at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday. I wanted something separate from myself, something I could observe, involved but undesiring, and I had the Mako mermaids, who could never be found and were ambitious in a way that’s uncommon in the real world. My ambition was to survive the summer without growing too attached to the fiction I was absorbing it, and I was doing just fine.
The unblemished perfection of a white, heterosexual, seemingly non-religious existence—and I could go on—was the core drive of the Mako mermaids. If they had a motive, as characters often do, it was to maintain that curtain of suburban bliss speckled with magic. If none of your ambitions or feelings match the pattern of the curtain, if none of the Mako girls have the deep, thorny thoughts, and devious intentions you harbor, then you can stay in front of that curtain for the duration of the episode, untouching, unwilling. The curtain bears no resemblance to your uniquely unmagical childhood, which consists of the following non-mermaid related transformations: sexuality clusterfuck, gender weirdness, onset of mental illness, trauma, fear, fearing trauma. Instead, it has all the components necessary to slightly shake, but never disturb or be truly relatable to a watching child.
And yet, I do not regret consuming that show for days on end. What I feel when I look at the stills from the show—and even when I see the disgusting spin-off on Netflix—is immense gratitude that I never let myself get too absorbed. I consumed and thought and twisted and worried, but came out fine. I did not want to be the girls, but I got to know them nonetheless, and their mistakes—too dependent on their magical powers and thus unrelatable to me—became my knowledge. They provided a refuge and succeeded in making it just otherworldly enough for me to want to leave eventually. And if I still occasionally want a tail, well, it’s not because it’s better than no tail. It’s because it’s pretty.

Like most Lutheran communities, the church I grew up in placed a particular emphasis on the musical aspect of worship. Lutherans’ musical roots run deep: Many of the great German composers, including Handel and Bach, were Lutheran, and our founder, Martin Luther, once wrote that “next to the Word of God, the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world.” (In fact, Luther himself penned the de facto Lutheran theme song, “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.”) My mother’s side of the family is Lutheran through and through—her generation was the first to leave Missouri and marry outside of the German Lutheran community.
Attending church as a child, the hymns were the only part of the service that interested me, with the possible exception of communion (or, as I semi-blasphemously thought of it, “snacktime”). I was eventually able to sing harmonies, and even learned some choruses by heart; I developed a taste for the traditional hymns, and fostered a moderate level of contempt for more recent compositions. This was further encouraged by my mother, who instilled in me a particular disdain for modern pop-style worship music, or as she refers to it, “Jesus-is-my-boyfriend songs.” (No offense to those who enjoy and/or connect to God through Jesus-is-my-boyfriend music. It’s His place to judge you, not mine.)
I may have memorized a couple of choruses, but my mother, the daughter of a Lutheran minister, knows several entire hymns by heart. But even her grasp on the Lutheran musical canon pales in comparison to that of her own mother.
My mother’s mother, the minister’s wife, was in her eighties when I was born, and she died at the respectable age of 95 (my grandfather passed shortly before I was born). She lived in Missouri, so I didn’t see her often, and the majority of my memories from those visits revolve around such childhood delights as ice skating, a museum with a ball pit, and a place called “the Magic House,” which had a van de Graaff generator.
I have few specific memories of my grandmother herself, but I do remember the feeling of her presence. It was gentle and calming; she was extraordinarily kind and full of love, even as she developed Alzheimer’s disease and her health deteriorated. One of my specific memories of her involves going to church on a visit to Missouri. She held a hymnal, but she wasn’t looking at it. She knew every word to every hymn we sang. Even as the faces of her children slipped from her memory, even as she began to believe that her husband was alive and well again, she held on to each word of the hymns, songs she had been singing for nearly a century.
As my grandmother neared the end of her life, we moved her to a small assisted living home in California, close to my aunt. I visited her once there as well, and my mother and I sat with her and held her hands and sang hymns with her—“Beautiful Savior,” “Amazing Grace,” “A Mighty Fortress.” She still knew all the words, and sang along in a quiet, cracking voice.
Alzheimer’s runs in the family; my mother is almost certainly going to develop it eventually. It hurts to think that someday she might not know me, her only child. We sometimes talk about recognizing the right time to embrace death, rather than fighting it. My mother has told me that the “right time” for her is when music ceases to bring her joy. I hope and pray that she holds on to the hymns until her last day, just like her mother did.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My childhood is pink like bubble baths, like chiffon princess gowns, like the cotton candy my father used to buy me every spring at the Pima County Fair.
In many ways, Melanie Martinez’s “Cry Baby” is the pink of my childhood, reconceived. It’s an album bittersweet like the taste of strawberry shortcake and Country Time lemonade, each song named after the vestiges of youth—“Dollhouse,” “Training Wheels,” “Tag, you’re it.”
Like a candy apple dipped in a coating of naïveté, each track is a tribute to the ostensible simplicity of youth, but simultaneously tugs at the harsh realities of growing up. Embodying a child thrust prematurely into the woes of adulthood, Martinez sings of heartbreak, alcoholism, and infidelity to the soporific rhythms of a baby’s musical mobile, the metronomic winding of a jack-in-the-box, the bubbling sounds of a warm bath.
Each chapter of the album is a haunting dose of reality that is at once redolent of tea parties, dollhouses, and dress-up games gone wrong. A fairytale flipped upside down, “Cry Baby” is a chilling ode to the delusions of childhood set in the aftermath of a young girl’s birthday party. Sagging streamers and airless balloons haphazardly decorate the room. A half-eaten slice of cake sits idly on the folding table. The atmosphere is morose.
Likewise, the album’s storybook accompaniment details the dreamlike adventures of Martinez’s infantile alter ego in rhyming couplets as she experiences love, loss, and wrath, ultimately prevailing over the insecurities of girlhood and finding a voice of her own.
Listening to “Cry Baby” is like discovering your favorite stuffed animal at the bottom of a cardboard box in your bedroom closet, getting your ears pierced at Claire’s for the first time, or looking through your kindergarten yearbook hours before high school graduation. It’s wistful, and a little painful all the same.
With each listen, I continually relive the suppressed memories of my youth, from falling into a bush trying to ride a bike without training wheels “scared to take them off but they're so worn down,” to losing my favorite teddy bear in the park “you were comforting and quiet,” to running from boys during recess “you're the prince of the playground.”
Through “Mad Hatter,” I find myself back at the teacup ride in Disneyland, where for a single day each year, I’d live out my childhood dream of becoming a princess. Through “Carousel,” I’m transported back to the merry-go-round where I’d hold my mother’s hand tight. And through “Play Date,” I always reminisce about short-lived friendships that faded into the ether at the conclusion of elementary school.
But beyond the nostalgia it evokes, Martinez’s magnum opus is emotional catharsis cloaked in an unabashed celebration of femininity. It chronicles the most traumatic moments of being a woman by coloring them in a bold shade of pink, complete with the flamboyant glitter and sparkles of girlhood. Martinez is unapologetic as she croons to the beat of bubblegum pop synthesizers, unmasking the agony beneath the saccharine smiles of womanhood.
Like Nicki Minaj’s “Pink Friday” and Gwen Stefani’s “The Sweet Escape,” Martinez’s “Cry Baby” harnesses the sounds, smells, and symbols of girlhood to breathe life into the dynamic story of a young woman struggling to resist social conventions, to carve out her own image in a world full of rigid expectations.
But in “Cry Baby,” I see more than just Martinez’s alter ego growing into her own skin over the course of 16 chapters. I see a grueling process of self-discovery shared by a world of girls and women struggling to find their unique voices. I see bits and pieces of myself, or at least, who I used to be.
With the pacifying sounds of a childhood renewed, “Cry Baby” continually implores me to confront my demons that have hidden dormant for a decade beneath a façade of adulthood. It encourages me to come to terms with the shame of fateful quarrels with old friends, the regret of words unsaid on the playground, the frustration of childhood dreams shattered. It awakens me to finally face the monster under the bed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Sunday night, and I’m lying with my eyes closed, thinking in my usual Faulknerian rhythm: “I don’t want to go to work tomorrow I hate Mondays it’s so unfair,” when I hear the familiar pitter-patter of my nine-year-old sister, Rebecca’s feet on the wooden floorboards outside my door.
“Rob, have you really read all the Lemony Snicket books?”
“Yes, I told you. All 13."

“Really?” This was followed by the cute, comical gasp all children make whenever they hear anything even slightly dramatic. “All 13 books?! When did you read them?”
“When I was six? The last ones came out when I was eight, so I had to wait a while. But I was six when I read the first 10 or so.”
“Six?!” I’ve told this to her before, but I think she enjoys hearing me recount it. “Why would you even read them? The show is much better.”
“Because the Netflix series didn’t exist then, and the Jim Carrey movie only covered the first three books. ‘Covered’ is putting it mildly. And, because the book is always better than the movie. Or show.”
“I don’t believe you.” Her face puffed up with the inadvertent awkward smile she makes when confronted with an uncomfortable truth.
The Netflix show “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” has taken my sister by storm. She discovered it one day last year, soon after the first season had come out, and watched each episode. I was writing an essay soon after the spring semester began last year when I got a phone call with her on the other end, raving about how the second season was out and she couldn’t believe what had happened.
I could—I’d known what happened for more than a decade. But it was amusing to hear her tell it, at least until she began bringing up all the ways in which the Netflix show diverged from the books.
“No, that doesn’t happen in the book. She never did that.”
“But they showed—.”
“Olivia is a character in one book only. She doesn’t appear anywhere else. Certainly not,” I glowered at her, “in book seven.”
“This is why the books are dumb and weird! They don’t follow the show.”
“No, they’re not. They’re works of art.”
“Then why don’t you read them? I never see you read any of the books you say are good and that you tell me to read.”
I have a complicated relationship with my childhood. Like the quasi-Millennial I am, I idolize my youth, romanticize it, ascribe meanings to those long-ago years that they never had. Yet each time I come across a remnant from those supposedly halcyon days, I cringe and ignore it. The stories I wrote, the pictures I drew, even most of my former favorite books—I can’t revisit them. For some reason, I compare the innocence and simplicity of my earliest works with the relative complexity and “maturity” of my most recent discoveries, and judge the former. It’s snobbery at its worst, but it’s uncontrollable, forcing me to deny my past while simultaneously romanticizing it.
And while I’d gone back and tried rereading some of the books I loved as a kid, even if I cringed at many of them, I’d never gone back and reread “Unfortunate Events.” Yes, I’d been busy, I’d been away from home and my book collection—there were a million reasons not to go back. This summer I’d come home, but to an internship that took up most of my time and left me with almost no chance to read. And yet, those 13 books kept crossing my mind. Rebecca had kindled a flame, one that made me reminisce about all the series that made up my childhood—“The Hunger Games,” “The 39 Clues,” and of course, “Harry Potter.” (Before you ask, of course I’ve re-read “Harry Potter.” It transcends almost everything else.)
My favorite books as a child were always “Unfortunate Events.” I knew these books were wonderful. What was stopping me from reading them? Was I afraid I’d hate them, and poison my memories of them forever?
My sister left the room. I lay there thinking, not about work but about “Unfortunate Events”—how would the books age? I needed to know.
Channeling my inner Klaus Baudelaire, I went over to my bookshelf and began removing books from the second-topmost shelf, revealing the second layer of books hidden behind it. As I’d acquired more and more books, I’d taken my childhood companions and covered them up with the books from my high school and college reading lists.
Unsealing them from the obscurity which I’d consigned them to, the 13 books stared back at me. I selected one at random—“The Ersatz Elevator”—sat on the floor, and began reading.
It read: “The book you are holding in your two hands right now—assuming that you are, in fact, holding this book, and that you have only two hands—is one of two books in the world that will show you the difference between the word ‘nervous’ and the word ‘anxious.’ The other book, of course, is the dictionary, and if I were you I would read that book instead.”
I sat staring at that page, taking in the dry, droll humor, and reflecting on all I’d probably missed as a child in those books. This was amazing. I kept reading, and smiling at all the subtle English literature jokes (which, as an English concentrator, I loved), and the absurdity of all the situations. This wasn’t immature at all—there were references to Thomas Pynchon!
It seemed like almost no time at all, but I reached the end of the book. I was still on the floor, mind racing. I was brought back to October 13, 2006 (of course, a Friday), when I’d attended a Barnes & Noble on the other side of town to attend a midnight launch party for “The End,” the final installment in the series. I remembered all the car trips I’d taken as a child when I had one of those books in my lap, whiling away the miles with the pages. And I remembered the hours I’d spent learning codes and ciphers, trying to be like the resourceful and clever Baudelaire siblings, and become a secret volunteer.
These memories made me smile. Chuckle. In a summer when I could feel my childhood and past slipping away from me more acutely than ever, the weight of the words I’d read, especially that absurdly specific introduction, was enough to comfort me.
Maybe, finally, I’d learned to reconcile my childhood with the present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a tattered copy of George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” in my old bedroom at my childhood home in Southern California. The bedroom is not mine anymore. When I left to college, my brother overtook it until he left for college. Since he left home, my Abuela Margo has inherited the room.
And yet, on a shelf in the room that is no longer mine, sits the Orwell novel. The cover is nearly completely ripped off, the spine a shattered mix of glue and paper. I’ve held onto it because it is the first real novel I remember reading.
There weren’t many novels in my home growing up. I’m sure there were more books than I remember, but those that stick out most vividly are the books I acquired myself. There was the collection of children’s encyclopedias, of which the one about dinosaurs and the animal kingdom were my favorites.
Those were a gift from my godfather, who also gifted me “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” the first book I read in the series that would teach me to love literature. When he passed away in 2009, some of the pain came from knowing I’d never again see the man who helped spark my own personal library.
But “Animal Farm” was different because it wasn’t a book meant to teach me how to love learning. It was a book for those who already read intellectually, for people who were into global politics, for those trying to make sense of totalitarianism. It wasn’t for the kind of reader I was then, but I read it anyway and I loved it.
Of course, I didn’t understand any of it. To me, it was just a story about pigs, horses, and the rude exclusion of Snowball from the farm. But it was still challenging and intriguing, so I moved it from an old drawer in the garage where I’d found it into the personal library in my room.
Then, nearly a decade later, I got to Harvard, home of an 18 million volume library system comprising the largest private collection in the world. With the click of a button, I could have nearly any book imaginable pulled out just for me. From the stacks, I excavated a reprint of Roque Dalton’s poetry, sold in London to raise funds for the leftist organizers during the Salvadoran Civil War. My godfather’s brother was a general in the Salvadoran guerilla. Last summer, when I went to meet with him in San Salvador, I brought a copy of the memoir he’d published, stamped with HARVARD COLLEGE on the inside pages.
And yet I’ve continued buying stacks and stacks of books for the personal collection I’ve started building in my dorm. When it comes time to rent or buy books off a syllabus, I ask myself: Is this a book you want your child to read one day?
The answer is usually yes. I’ll read them the Harry Potter series, one I’ve cobbled together from thrift stores and gifts, when they’re young. My 1991 reprint of “Catcher in the Rye” will be handed off mid-high school. “Beloved,” for whenever the world reminds us of its necessity. “Ulysses,” just to confuse the hell out of them when in college.
My future children have given me an excuse to build two libraries—one at college and one at home. Books migrate back and forth between my two homes, snuggled under Harvard hoodies and pressed against memories of semesters past. I think about my unborn children and my two libraries often because they’ve come to represent the two selves I’ve been unable to fold into one: my pre-Harvard and my post-Harvard self.
Harvard has deeply and irreversibly changed me. It’s no secret that this University is built off of decades of mind-boggling wealth. Legacies are admitted at five-times the rate of students whose parents didn’t go to Harvard. 15 percent of students at Harvard come from families in the top 1 percent of incomes. Only 4.5 percent come from families in the lowest 20 percent.
I was never slotted to be one of those people who’d collect business cards like candy, over a few glasses of sweet champagne. And yet, I’ve learned how to feel comfortable in spaces chock-full of Harvard alumni, with only a brand name linking us together. I’ve sipped on power and prestige, and it no longer nauseates me or makes me feel like I’m floating outside of my skin.
The change terrifies me. I loved books like “Animal Farm” simply because they entered my life at the right moment, by chance alone. Now, I try keeping up with what’s hot in the publishing world—which new books are being talked about, which literary magazines carry the most prestige. Chance encounters with a life-shattering novel are becoming rarer and rarer.
Before starting at Harvard, I resigned my love to literature to being a lifelong hobby. I’d pursue a degree in practicality, to get a job that would make my parent’s immigrant sacrifices worth it all. Now my career dreams—a PhD, then a swanky professorship somewhere—involve sustaining myself economically by reading, writing, and teaching literature.
It’s a selfish dream, and an immense privilege, to choose to love books for a living. There are thousands of young Salvadoran folks out there who didn’t receive the lucky ivory ticket that I did in March of 2015. There are thousands of immigrant poets and book lovers whose daily preoccupation is feeding themselves and their families, even it means relentless back-breaking work.
Harvard has set me on a different path, one I might deserve but definitely no more than anyone else from my background. Privilege and power are intergenerational, so my children will grow up with the luxuries my education has offered me. They won’t grow up with a rogue novel to stumble upon; they’ll have carefully curated universes at their fingertips. Their libraries won’t be the rag-tag collection of novels picked up at used book stores and thrift shops.
The books my children will grow up with will be books picked off Harvard syllabi, or those I paid full-price for at independent bookstores the first time I visited New York, Washington D.C, and Manila. Their library will represent the self I lost, inevitably, when I decided to get on a plane to Boston and study at the oldest university in the country, to try springboarding into a class of American society never built to accommodate people like me.
Thinking about the immediate future terrifies me, so I seldom dream about where I’ll be living post-graduation. I avoid imaging whether it’ll be a small basement apartment or a small room in a suburban home (it will be small, I can assure you). But I do often think about my personal library: where it’ll be within my small space, the color and grain of the bookshelves, whether I’ll organize my books by author’s last name or by genre and topic.
And, of course, where exactly I’ll place that old copy of “Animal Farm,” tattered pages and all.

July 19 marked 10 years since the finale of “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” the Nickelodeon animated kids’ fantasy series, first aired. My mother reliably assures me it did show on TV where I was raised and live, India, but I had never even heard of it while it was running. Now, I run through all 60-odd episodes between each semester of college, not least because the show’s arcs and themes are ones that inspire my own writing. But with every rerun, the wish hits me like a two-ton truck—that I could have watched this show for the first time as a kid.
My first contact with “The Last Airbender” was through the 2010 M. Night Shyamalan live-action adaptation, a movie that could not be redeemed by even Dev Patel. I was not impressed, and I cringe even now when I catch glimpses of it on TV. The movie has myriad flaws, but having watched its source material several times now, I know that part of the magic for me comes specifically from the East Asian and Inuit influences on the show’s storyline. The elemental magic of the Avatar world is not just shooting water or fire; it’s specifically tied to martial arts, which are in turn specifically tied to cultures. Seeing white actors Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone in the roles of Katara and Sokka from the Inuit-inspired Water Tribe saps that beauty, like a pale, dissatisfying shadow of a rich, diverse setting. Reflecting on it now, it’s pretty amazing that a TV show so plainly influenced by non-Western cultures ran for years to critical acclaim, amid American favorites like “Danny Phantom” (2004-2007), “The Fairly OddParents” (2001-2017), and “Kim Possible” (2002-2007).
Most of all, I wish I had a character like Katara while growing up. Aang, the Avatar, might be the show’s chosen one, but Katara, a young waterbender from the South Pole, is the viewers’ introduction to the world: The famous intro speech before every episode is in her voice, and she’s the first character we meet. She might not be Indian like me, but seeing a brown female main character in a fantasy show or book is rare enough. Between the stereotypes and the throwaways (yes, I’m looking at you, Patil twins), it’s refreshing and inspiring to watch Katara, who is not transplanted to another culture but carries the influence of the Southern Water Tribe with her, in everything from her style of dress to her waterbending. And yet Katara—whose village was attacked, who hasn’t seen her father in years, whose mother was killed by Fire Nation soldiers—also bears the pain of subjugation, like so many other brown girls.
Like all the girls I have ever been, Katara is full of wonderful contradictions. She’s the bossy, straight-laced mom of the group, but also a formidable fighter. In the show’s course she goes from a girl who can barely waterbend to a master who defeats a firebending prodigy. Her defining quality is her compassion. In one episode, she delays the gang’s quest to save the world by days in order to help an impoverished village, and delivers one of her most memorable lines: “I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me.”
And yet, she nurses grudges like they’re living things to be fed anger and hurt; she feels betrayal as keenly as dagger wounds. Nowhere is this more obvious than when Zuko, the Fire Nation prince who hunted Katara and her friends for two seasons, decides to help the gang instead. While the rest of Team Avatar warms up to Zuko, Katara remains suspicious of his motives—not just because of what he represents and the trouble he’s caused, but because of his previous very personal betrayal, when he rejected her offer of help and forgiveness. “Katara is so annoying,” my brother complained during my latest rewatch, after several episodes of her snapping at Zuko. It was his first time watching the show, so I chose to stay quiet instead of jumping to her defense. I love Zuko’s redemption arc, but these scenes always give rise to some unnamed feeling in me. Only this time did I realise why. Like Katara, I would not forgive so quickly. I may never have had a fire-conjuring prince chase me around the world, but I count my betrayals too. And that realization was sharply rewarding—because if I can see myself in Katara’s most spiteful, bitter moments, then maybe I can learn to see myself in her kindness.
This is not to say that the show is exempt from criticism. There are creative decisions it takes that I disagree with, even where Katara’s concerned. But for the creators to bring to life a brown heroine with empathy and love—to identify her within the show as “the brave Katara”—means more to me than I can ever fully put into words. I might not have grown up with Katara, but I can at least meet her now as I continue finding myself, again and again and again.

It’s funny how different parts of great albums strike you differently as you grow up. When I first listened to “The Dark Side of the Moon,” which turned 45 years old in March, as an angsty, leftist teen, I was blown away. First, by the music—the high-concept fusion of blues, rock, and prog, with a bit of jazz and avant-garde, woven together by segues and special effects. Then, by the lyrics—the takedowns of capitalism, at turns weary and bitterly sarcastic, in “Breathe” and “Money,” and the heartfelt lamentation on mental illness and the difficulty of interpersonal communication in “Brain Damage.”
But as I geared up to write this piece, I listened to the album while on a treadmill, taking a break from the usual reading, writing, thesis emails, and general future-planning anxiety that consume most of my days abroad at Cambridge, the childhood home of Pink Floyd’s lyricist Roger Waters. (The innumerable “keep off the grass” signs here apparently inspired the lyrics of “Brain Damage.”) I’d heard this album a hundred-odd times, but “Time” had never hit me so hard. Emotionally, most of the songs on “Dark Side” are reflective, resigned, yearning. “Time,” my current favorite, clears that depressed fog for a moment of horrifying clarity. After its famous alarm-clock-ring intro and tick-tock build-up, David Gilmour begins a vocal performance just as immediate, almost panicked, as its lyrics. “You run and you run to catch up with the sun but it’s sinking / Racing around to come up behind you again / The sun is the same, in a relative way, but you’re older / Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.” “Time” sees Waters at his most concise, direct, and expressive. It could be pretentious, except that Gilmour sings it so sincerely that it sounds like the terrified, existential scream that its lyrics suggest. What more appropriate way to dwell on it than running in place, with the treadmill’s digital tally registering every second spent?
This ability of “Dark Side” to shift for its audience partly explains its staggering popularity. “Dark Side” has spent 937 weeks—over 18 years—on the Billboard 200, more than any other album; the runner-up, Bob Marley and the Wailers’ greatest-hits album “Legend,” has spent 514. At about 45 million sales, it stands as the third-best-selling record ever. Of course, millions of those sales went to non-English-speaking countries. Perhaps the general existentialist, anti-materialist, and pacifist messages came through, even just in the song titles. But the musical excellence rivals that of the themes. “Money,” another lyrical gem, highlights Gilmour’s masterful guitar work and Pink Floyd’s stunning production. It earned fame as the biggest-ever hit with a 7/4 time signature—a move often used as a gimmick by lesser prog bands, but here, it justifies itself. The time signature sets the bass riff overlapping on itself, but the multiple rhythm tracks with different guitar effects and Nick Mason’s busy drumming create the impression that the song seeks to break free from the cycle of both its bassline and modern capitalism. And then, it does: The breakdown sends us into a furious guitar solo in 4/4. But soon enough, we’re back in 7/4, constrained, hurried, and unnatural, for the final verse.
If any rock songs have ever approached such an incredible marriage of sound and content, they might also be on “Dark Side.” “Us and Them” alternates muted, peaceful meditations on the conflicts that dominate and take human lives, its echoing vocals suggesting the timelessness of such problems, with loud, minor-key illustrations of those conflicts. Like “Money,” it features a spot-on saxophone solo from Dick Parry. The slide guitar on “Breathe” sounds like the inhalations the narrator commands. (The album’s smooth, warm textures, along with its lyrical profundity, contribute to its status as the ultimate stoner-rock record.) And Pink Floyd peppers each song with dialogue and clever (if sometimes grandiose) sound effects. Your mileage (so to speak) may vary with “On the Run,” but it struck studying-abroad me as a brilliant experiment that perfectly captures the anxieties and phobias of travel. And I can’t imagine a conclusion to “Dark Side” besides the same heartbeat effect that begins the album. Even during the album’s 42 minutes, your mortal body carries on toward its decay. Tick, tick, tick.
As I’ve alluded in passing, the classic criticism of “Dark Side” is grandiosity. I’ll grant it that: It’s an album about the meaning of life, chronicling the biggest problems of the modern world. It does require some buy-in, though I think the strength of the music invites it. Written by a few white, somewhat-educated Englishmen in 1973, it cannot be truly universal, though its gargantuan global sales testify to the connection to it that people across cultures, classes, and eras feel.
But it also has historical value as a pioneer of ambitiousness. It did not invent the concept album, but it set a new standard for scope and coherence. Compare it to some of the greatest albums since its release. “OK Computer” borrows many of its critiques of modernity; “DAMN.” shares its bookending sound effects (and just look at the track names!). “Dark Side” showed the world the limitlessness of popular music, the amount of meaning it could take on without losing an ounce of quality. The album cover, one of the most enduring pop symbols in the world, exactly matches the exultant refraction that frames the album: “Breathe” lyrically opens the album with its melancholy declaration that “All you touch and all you see / Is all your life will ever be,” but the closing “Eclipse” lists a wide range of experiences, like “All that you eat / And everyone you meet.” The crashing chords endorse each as meaningful—even if they’re eclipsed by the moon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was an era in children’s television, which has long since passed, when network executives seemed unsure whether their job was to entertain kids or scare them near to death. This period coincided roughly with the turn of the 21st Century, and one of its lasting legacies is the Cartoon Network animated series “Courage the Cowardly Dog,” a show about a pink dog named Courage who lives in the middle of nowhere and routinely becomes entangled with monsters and aliens.
Though I rarely remember having nightmares as a kid, “Courage the Cowardly Dog” alone is responsible for a sizable majority of those I did have. In fact, mention the show to anybody who grew up watching cartoons during the early 2000s, and I’m sure they’ll feel an uncomfortable, nostalgia-induced shiver down their spine. I always thought that the show amassed far too much air time for how popular—or unpopular—it was. Nobody I knew would actually admit to liking it.
What’s more, “Courage”  always seemed to sneak up on me. One moment I would be enjoying the mindless buffoonery of “Ed, Edd n Eddy,” and the next I would hear the familiar refrain: “We interrupt this program to bring you... Courage the Cowardly Dog Show, starring Courage, the Cowardly Dog!” While even the intro sequence stirred feelings of dread, I could never bring myself to change the channel. Looking back on it, maybe this was how the show managed so much screen time—good ratings fueled by the morbid curiosity of elementary schoolers.
It is difficult to understate how weird this show actually was. In one episode, a tribe of bullfrogs invades Courage’s home and forces his adopted family to dig ponds and croak. Others feature a psychopathic snowman, a robotic doppelganger, and a duck masquerading as a doctor that tries to swindle people out of their life savings. A particularly dark story is about a friendly pig running a restaurant, who Courage learns secretly kills humans and serves their flesh. The theme of humans being used as food is recurrent throughout the series. Another episode involves a Cajun fox that captures Courage’s caretaker Muriel and attempts to cook her in a stew. (Yes, this show was supposedly for kids.)
The showrunners probably had a good laugh when they came up with the idea of calling their protagonist Courage, a name meant to be ironic, because the anthropomorphic dog’s defining trait was cowardice. Imagine Courage kind of like Scooby-Doo, only he isn’t surrounded by a bunch of college kids who fawn over him and he never gets any credit for his hard work. For the record, I have no beef with Scooby. But let’s just establish that Courage never gorged himself on self-branded dog treats. As far as talking animals go, he was pretty relatable. And he got the job done.
If you look deeper, though, Courage’s backstory is actually pretty tragic. He was orphaned as a pup, only to be adopted by Muriel, a warm old Scottish woman that lives with her husband Eustace in a small house somewhere so remote that roads don’t even stretch there. Eustace is a total jerk, whose sole purpose in life is to remind Courage he is a “stupid dog.” Oh, and of course there are monsters, aliens, and ghosts abound. All Courage wants is a loving family, or at least some peace and quiet. Instead, he endures Eustace’s constant verbal abuse, as well as an onslaught of supernatural creatures that won’t leave him alone.
What made the horror of “Courage the Cowardly Dog” so terrifying was the sense of open-ended possibility which accompanied each misadventure. The show’s villains concocted elaborate plots, backed with abundant resources and driven by compelling motives. Courage was just a scared dog, the exact opposite personality-wise of most typical children’s TV protagonists, who inspire confidence and remain composed while facing danger. In most entertainment meant for kids, you know that the hero will overcome all obstacles, evil will be vanquished and things will go back to how they should be. When watching Courage, on the other hand, I would get an overwhelming premonition that the worst might actually happen. And sometimes it did. In an especially jarring episode, a villain turns Eustace and Muriel into inanimate puppets, and Courage is forced to cope by moving the strings and ventriloquizing what he remembers of their personalities.
On rainy afternoons during my childhood, I found my eyes glued to the TV watching disturbing scenes like this, rooting for Courage. He had it rough. That said, I could never pinpoint what exactly drew me to the character. One thing that always confused me about his adventures was the lack of catharsis at the end. While Scooby and the gang always finished an episode by unmasking the culprit, who scornfully exclaimed that he or she “would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren’t for you meddling kids,” Courage just went back home and had to deal with Eustace’s cruelty. Both shows shared a formulaic return to normalcy at the end of each installment, but, for Courage, normal wasn’t anything good.
Still, this dreary tone also allowed for the show’s most pragmatic life lessons. Foremost among them was the idea that sometimes you really can’t run away from the things you are scared of. Facing impending doom against a nightmarish foe, Courage had no choice but to find a way to solve his own problems. He thwarted his enemies, all while anxious and trembling. In retrospect, that’s what made Courage so relatable. He understood that it’s normal to be afraid, and that just because you stand up against something you’re scared of, doesn’t mean it will suddenly become less scary. Children’s media often promotes this romantic notion that facing fears allows people to instantaneously overcome them. “Courage the Cowardly Dog” asserted that fear is okay, and that it is how we respond to inescapable circumstances that defines us. Although it terrified me, I kept returning to the show because it refused to sugarcoat one of the hardest things to accept about growing up—the fact that real life is unpredictable.
No matter what horror he went through, Courage would come back, plop himself down on the couch, and wait for the next one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear reader,
Summertime is drenched in nostalgia. It’s the season for homecomings, reunions with high school friends, and returns to our childhood bedrooms, still decorated for an angstier, teenage audience.
It’s the perfect time to revel in this sentimentality. Earlier this summer, The Crimson put out a call for your writing. We wanted to hear about the works that gave courage to your younger self, about the characters you wished you could have looked up to as a child. We wanted the books you devoured on long car rides, the inspiration for New Year’s karaoke nights, the songs that make you feel like a kid again.
“In Retrospect” is our first ever Arts summer supplement. It’s a collection of essays from the entire Harvard student body centered loosely around the theme of childhood and art. Many thanks to my editors Caroline Tsai, Edward Litwin, and Lucy Wang, and my co-Chair Mila Gauvin II for working on this project with me. After a long summer of organizing, planning, and editing, we're so excited to finally present "In Retrospect."
Happy reading!
