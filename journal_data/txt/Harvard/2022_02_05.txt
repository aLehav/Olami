After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Here I am now, a signed artist doing the kind of music that I want to do and I couldn’t be happier,” said Erin Stevenson, an R&B, soul, and pop singer, producer, and songwriter in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I’m excited about what’s next. Just don’t give up.”
Stevenson started her music career singing in Girl's Tyme — the group that would later become Destiny’s Child. After graduating college, she worked in marketing before she was asked to sing in a show.
“I didn’t look back,” Stevenson said. “So I started singing in cover bands.” Shortly after, she was approached in California by a stranger who she later found out was Janet Jackson’s drummer. He offered Stevenson an audition and shortly after, she began singing background for Janet Jackson and other artists.
“You have to love what you do because it’s a lot that comes with it — it’s not for the faint of heart,” Stevenson said.
Stevenson released her debut solo album “Naked” in 2017. Her first single “Hangin” made the top 10 on the UK music charts and charted on the soul charts in the United States. Following this success, she released the indie-chart-topping single “Making It Last Forever” in 2019, and her latest singles “You Gotta Be” and “Never Too Much” set her up to win a 2021 “People’s Choice Indie Soul Award.”
Stevenson also felt that the pandemic brought beneficial changes to her career and livelihood during the past couple of years.
“I was touring and performing so much prior to [the pandemic] that it forced me to rest, which I needed to do. But at the same time, it also forced me to focus solely on myself and make myself a priority,” Stevenson said. “So it was the most that I rested, but at the same time the most I have worked because I now have a whole other album coming out, but I get my name, which is great.”
Stevenson has spent much of her career singing as backup for other major artists, but the pandemic allowed her to focus on promoting herself. As a result, she has a new album coming out this year. A recent signee with individual records, the album will be Stevenson’s first major release under a record label. Her first single under the label “Everything to Me” will be released on Feb. 18, 2022, and will reflect her love for her husband.
Much like other artists who utilized streaming services to broadcast live shows to their fans over the pandemic, Stevenson also found that these experiences were valuable for artists as ways to continue their work during the isolation. However, to Stevenson, streaming a live show was still not the same as an engaging, in-person experience.
“In regards to live performances, the streaming thing was a lifesaver, a game-changer, and a whole other learning curve. But, it’s still not the same as having that live energy with people,” said Stevenson.“I think people who weren’t in the music industry still need to see some form of normalcy and music in love.”
At the time, Stevenson was rehearsing for her upcoming Christmas Show and was looking forward to performing for a sold-out crowd on Dec. 10.
“Christmas music is a bit more intricate than regular R&B,” Stevenson said. “They are arrangements, it’s not looped. So bringing the setlist together with which songs that flow that still suit me and my happy personality. I’m really excited about it because Christmas is one of my favorite holidays and because I get to be happy on purpose.”
Stevenson also revealed that she has some surprises for those coming out to the show in December. “I have two special guests that are going to join me,” Stevenson said.
While many of her recent performances have been online due to the pandemic, Stevenson has vast experience preparing for shows and honing in on the interests of her audience. When planning a show, she stays focused on several fundamental elements of her audience and the performance.
“A few things that never change when it comes to preparing the show is knowing your audience, your age group, and demographics,” said Stevenson. “Don’t be the bad DJ that only plays what you want to hear. Find out what the people want and give it to them, of course, while doing you.”
As an artist, Stevenson advocates for positivity and self-love through both her music and her vibrant on-stage performances. Her current musical focus is about differentiating herself and promoting positivity throughout the obstacles that may arise.
“Forget about everyone else’s opinion and listen to your own air,” Stevenson said. “And sometimes that’s hard to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spurred on by the 2020 police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, junior Fred Asare-Konadu decided that in order to counteract the tragedies, he would empower future generations of citizens with the tools and resources necessary to enact social change through the power of the vote.
Asare-Konadu, a midfielder for Harvard’s men’s lacrosse team, ultimately partnered with his high school friend John Bedell, now a freshman at the University of Virginia, to found a movement called We Go Vote.
Asare-Konadu realized that he could take advantage of Florida’s requirement that each student graduating from high school participate in a government class. By creating a system to deploy in the classroom, he aims to give students the opportunity to pre-register to vote when they turn 16 so that once they are able to participate in local and national elections, they won’t be barred by the act of registration.
Asare-Konadu emphasized the importance of educating students in a swing state like Florida, which is often hotly contested in presidential elections. The state houses differing political ideologies, with the north being much more conservative than the democratic south.
“We fully believe that voter registration should be something that is bipartisan,” Asare-Konadu said. “What makes a democracy a democracy is the fact that there is freedom of thought. We don’t want to be in a situation where we are only registering people with similar viewpoints.”
In particular, he stressed the importance of a diversity of thought, especially since he began his endeavour during a politically polarized time.
“I started the voter registration initiative in the midst of the whole George Floyd movement, seeing a lot of my friends who kind of sat on both sides of the aisle come together for a common cause …. I saw an opportunity to put more power into the hands of my friends, and let them do the voting,” Asare-Konadu added.
The group was conceptualized during the 2020 election, when there was an emphasis on registering as many eligible citizens as possible.
Asare-Konadu took advantage of the influx of voters. He saw a niche in the younger population, recognizing that by incentivizing teachers to stress the importance of participation in local elections rather than solely national ones, he could pass on the tools for gradual change to thousands of students. He, as a student himself, was able to identify with his target audience and engage them through accessible resources.
The movement has been so successful in Florida that Asare-Konadu is looking to both expand his work to states with similar government requirements, as well as turn his work into permanent legislation. His aim is to introduce educational tools to teachers, mainly through the slides developed by himself and Bedell, and make it mandatory to provide the information to students so that they might be able to register.
Asare-Konadu has been in touch with different legislators who are backing his bill both in the House and Senate, and is hopeful that his legislation will eventually pass through both branches, but thinks that it will realistically take multiple legislative cycles.
Making large-scale change requires perseverance, which Asare-Konadu attributes to the lessons he has learned on and off the sports field.
“Sometimes you have to make the best of the opportunities you have,” he said. “It’s about building yourself back up and doing your best to make things happen.”
In between meetings with politicians and district superintendents, Asare-Konadu is forced to juggle classes and his responsibilities with the lacrosse team.
“I think it really comes down to time management… I have meetings with legislatures probably once a week, or once every two weeks at least,” Asare-Konadu said.“And now we are working on endorsements. So scheduling … can be tough when you have practice one day [and have to balance that with] people working nine to five. I have classes, I have practice, I have other things I need to do…. I do my best to make everything happen.”
He added that his teammates have not only shown an immense amount of support for him and his work, but have engaged with it so much that they now look to aid him in bringing new aspects and nuance to his work.
Balancing outside opinion with the core values of the organization is something that Asare-Konadu is working on now as he looks to recruit people to help him grow the movement.
“We think it’s important to find people who are willing to sacrifice time and people that we can trust to do a good job… The bigger you get, the more publicity you get, the more people see you, and actually reach out,” he said.
Asare-Konadu is confident that he can continue his work during an already demanding lacrosse season. He feels supported by his coaching staff and teammates, and attributes this camaraderie to values of hard work, self-respect, and dedication established by Coach Gerry Byrne. Additionally, he hopes that he can balance his political impact with helping the Crimson to a strong 2022 season, which will begin Feb. 19 against the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
