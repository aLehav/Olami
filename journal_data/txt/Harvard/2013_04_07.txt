After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the most hotly-contested Ivy League battles of the 2013 season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team was forced to watch as No. 2 Cornell celebrated on the field at Harvard Stadium after mounting a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to take down the Crimson, 14-12, on Saturday afternoon.
After three quarters of play in which the two sides were rarely separated by more than a goal, Harvard sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandevelde responded to a Cornell goal with a tally of his own, pushing the Crimson (4-6, 1-2 Ivy) ahead, 12-9, with just under 10 minutes to play. Teetering on the brink of its first conference loss, the Big Red (10-1, 4-0) responded in a manner befitting the nation’s second-ranked squad. Five unanswered Cornell goals, including the final three from senior midfielder Max Van Bourgondien, left the Crimson all but stunned, and it was forced to leave the field wondering what could have been.
“We played excellent lacrosse for 50 minutes, just not the whole game,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “In the fourth quarter, Cornell really stepped up and made plays.”
Harvard entered the final frame with a 10-7 lead over the Big Red, and the two sides traded goals in the quarter’s first few minutes, with the Crimson’s buffer never falling below two. But that all changed with nine minutes to play. Sophomore midfielder Connor Buczek took a feed from senior Connor English and fired a shot past senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger to bring his team within two.
Just 50 seconds later, the lead was dashed to one on a distance shot from senior attackman and former National Player of the Year Rob Pannell. Harvard clung to its one-goal advantage for the next five minutes, but it proved too fragile to last.
With less than four minutes to play, Van Bourgondien took over. He began by taking a feed from English and beating Krieger to knot the game at 12 apiece. The same duo connected less than a minute later, and Cornell took its first lead since early in the third quarter. Van Bourgondien then all but put the nail in the Harvard’s coffin with a third goal, unassisted this time, in the waning minutes of the game.
Despite a late Cornell penalty, Harvard’s frantic attempts for a late comeback were denied. Harvard’s loss marks the Big Red’s 14th straight victory over the Crimson, a streak which dates back to 1999.
“I think we might have tightened up a little bit [in the fourth quarter],” Krieger said. “We knew we had the lead, and I think we might have taken too much of a defensive stance when we could have still been attacking.”
Harvard held a slight 32-29 edge in ground balls on Saturday, but trailed, 29-23, in shots on net, with the entirety of that difference attributable to the pivotal fourth frame. The Crimson capitalized on four of its nine man-up opportunities, while Cornell recorded just one man-up goal on three chances. Both Krieger and his counterpart, senior AJ Fiore, were strong in net, grabbing 15 and 11 saves, respectively.
Cornell’s Pannell tallied two goals and three assists on the afternoon, but it was senior teammate Steve Mock that provided the most offense with a career-best six goals.
For Harvard, junior attackman Peter Schwartz led the way with three goals, while freshman attackman Devin Dwyer tallied five points, and senior attackman Alex White and Vandevelde each scored twice.
The defeat drops Harvard to a tie for fifth place in the Ivy League, half a game behind No. 16 Yale and No. 17 Penn.
The Crimson entered the second half on Saturday with a 6-4 advantage, but that lead was quickly erased by a trio of Cornell goals which left Harvard trailing by one with just over 10 minutes remaining in the frame.
With the Crimson defense on its heels, Krieger grabbed a save after a lengthy Cornell possession to slow the Big Red tide. Harvard responded with a run of its own. Slashing and pushing penalties on the other end gave the Crimson a two-man advantage, and after a couple of stalled efforts, junior attackman Garrett Campbell weaved through a seam in the Cornell defense and finished from point-blank range to knot the game at seven.
Harvard capitalized on yet another Cornell penalty on the ensuing possession that allowed Dwyer to score his second goal of the game. The momentum continued off of the following faceoff, as White maneuvered through the Big Red defense and finished from close range.
The Crimson added one more to enter the final frame with a three-goal cushion, and the two sides traded goals early in the quarter before Cornell’s decisive run.
“I’m really proud of our effort,” Wojcik said. “[Cornell] just found a way to win, and we didn’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team, winner of nine straight matches, is on a roll, and not even two ranked opponents and conference rivals could stop its momentum this weekend. The Crimson (14-4, 2-0 Ivy) opened up its Ivy League season at home by taking down No. 40 Columbia (11-6, 1-1 Ivy) and No. 48 Cornell (12-6, 1-2 Ivy) on Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Harvard, the defending Ivy League champion, is now ranked 18th in the nation. Crimson coach Dave Fish cited improved doubles play as a primary factor behind the winning streak.
“Our doubles have improved, and everyone takes them very seriously,” Fish said. “The players take pride in being well conditioned. Winning the doubles point is key, and we would’ve lost several matches this year if we didn’t win it.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 1
On Sunday, the Crimson not only picked up a key Ancient Eight win, but also earned an easy victory over a team that had beaten it earlier this season. Harvard lost to the Big Red, 4-2, at the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championship in February, but it was a different story on the Crimson’s home courts.
“At the ECAC Championship, we played Cornell at their home court, so we had to work a little harder then,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “We also had things we needed to improve on. Since the tournament, we’ve been focusing on the right things, and that showed today.”
There was little suspense in doubles. Harvard’s 65th-ranked doubles team of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen won, 8-3, at No. 1, and co-captain Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu won, 8-4, on the second court to give the Crimson the doubles point.
Harvard’s strong play continued in singles. Andy Nguyen, playing at No. 4, won his first set, 6-0, lost the first game of the second, and then reeled off six more games for a 6-0, 6-1 win.
MacMaster also took home a straight-set win, 6-3, 6-3, to put the Crimson up 3-0. Although Hu went down, 6-4, 6-2, Harvard retained a 3-1 advantage.
But Denis Nguyen took a 6-2, 6-2 victory to clinch the win for the Crimson. After the victory was secured, sophomore Alex Steinroeder took a straight-set win, and Chaudhuri won in a third-set tiebreak for the final margin.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 3
On Saturday, Harvard kicked off its league season with a victory. Last season, the Lions were the only Ivy team to beat the Crimson, but Harvard responded and avenged the loss on its home court. Saturday’s victory marked the 65th time in 80 total meetings that the Crimson beat Columbia.
Fish noted that the team was pleased to beat the Lions after the tough loss last year.
“Last year, they played a great match against us and upset us, but today we rebounded,” he said. “Everyone was motivated because of the sting of losing last year, and to win a close match on Saturday was great.”
In doubles, Steinroeder and Lam went down, 8-4, on the third court, but Andy Nguyen and Hu won by the same score at No. 2.
The doubles point would come down to the first court, featuring two nationally-ranked pairs in Columbia’s 36th-ranked Ashok Narayana and Max Schnur and Harvard’s No. 65 MacMaster and Denis Nguyen. MacMaster and Nguyen pulled off an 8-5 upset to give the Crimson the doubles point.
In singles, Denis Nguyen handily defeated the Lions’ No. 52 Winston Lin on the first court, 6-1, 6-3, to put Harvard up 2-0. Columbia bounced back by taking down the freshmen, Hu and Lam, to tie the overall score at 2-2.
Steinroeder captured a 6-2, 6-4 win at No. 3, but Chaudhuri lost on the second court. The overall score was knotted at 3-3, and the last match remaining was No. 4 singles. Andy Nguyen lost the first set, but took home the next two for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win to close it out for the Crimson.
Although it is early, the team feels very confident in its ability to have a successful league season.
“We’re very excited, and ready for every team,” Chaudhuri said. “But we’re definitely taking it match-by-match. We have a lot of tough teams left, and Ivy matches always seem to be close.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe heavyweight crew team found out the hard way that it was a tough weekend to row in Cambridge. Harsh winds and chilly temperatures created challenging conditions for the Black and White heavyweights, which opened up their Ivy season by taking on Brown on the Charles on Saturday morning.
“It was cold—but we’re sort of used to that in the spring—but the biggest challenge out there was the wind,” heavyweight’s coach Liz O’Leary said. “It was very gusty and it was kind of a quartering headwind, which means it’s blowing right at you. It was gusty and pretty strong, and that sort of churned up the basin down there on the race course, so it makes the conditions tough.”
While the heavyweights were battling it out with the Bears at home, their lightweight counterparts took a trip south to the Potomac River in Washington D.C. and were greeted by nicer weather and a pair of victories.
“We were actually pretty lucky. We had quite flat conditions and warmer weather than Cambridge, which was nice,” said Emma Lukasiewicz, the six seat on the 1V lightweight boat. “[There was] a bit of a tailwind, which is kind of a change-up because we usually have a headwind on the Charles. We just had to adjust to those conditions, but it meant fast racing, which is always really fun.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In its third race of the spring season, Brown came away with victories in three out of four races. The Bears took advantage of their experience on the water, benefiting from the postponement of the Beanpot, which made this race Radcliffe’s first of the spring season.
“Sure, it helps to have had a race,” O’Leary said. “That’s one of the things we love about the Beanpot—it’s a good way to race a handful of schools who are all in the same sort of environment as we are and so it was really too bad [that it was postponed]. It would have been helpful to have had a race prior to this one, but that’s the way it goes, so you have to sort of make the best of the time you have.”
The Black and White’s second varsity eight tallied Radcliffe’s lone victory of the day, rowing the two-kilometer course in 7:27.7, besting Brown’s 2V boat by a little over three seconds.
The varsity fours races started off the day on the river, with the Black and White capturing second and third out of four crews. The Bears’ top fours boat crossed the finish line seven seconds ahead of Radcliffe’s A boat with a time of 7:52.1.
The 1V and 3V races rounded out the day, as Brown’s top eights boat edged the Black and White by two seconds. The 3V found itself in second place as well, coming in eight seconds behind the Bears, finishing the course in 7:58.2.
After the races, O’Leary remains confident in the team’s progress.
“It was great for us to go up against a team like Brown to see initially where we stand,” O’Leary said. “I got out of it feeling optimistic. We have some specific parts of the race that we can do better, that we can work on, but overall I think all of our boats did a good job. It’s still relatively early in the season, so hopefully we can put our heads down and go to work and see where we stand next weekend.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweights continued their undefeated streak after cruising through the Beanpot last week. In both races, the Black and White handily defeated its opponents with victory margins in the double digits.
“We won our dual race against them last year, but definitely don’t underestimate anyone, and we know that Georgetown typically has a fast start,” Lukasiewicz said. “They did really well at sprints last year with a fast start, so one of our things was to try to not let them get ahead of us in the beginning, and I think we did a good job with that.”
The varsity eight was first on the Potomac for Radcliffe. The crew opened up the race with a lead and extended it throughout the competition to row the two-kilometer race in 6:32.5, over 20 seconds faster than the Hoyas.
“We had a good start, a good first 500,” Lukasiewicz said. “I think we were a length’s up by the first 500, and then we just sort of executed our own race plan and tried to keep gaining some more distance as we went down the course and finished with a good time and a good margin, so I think we were pleased.”
The second varsity four competed in the only other race of the day and pulled out a similar finish, besting Georgetown’s boat by more than 15 seconds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andre Akpan ’10 has been given wings.
The former Harvard forward was traded to the New York Red Bulls for a conditional draft pick this week, bringing a four-year stint with the Colorado Rapids to an end.
“Andre is strong, physical forward with MLS experience and will provide another attacking option for our coaching staff,” Red Bulls sporting director Andy Roxburgh said in a statement. “We are pleased to sign him and look forward to his contributions in the coming season.”
Akpan was selected by the Rapids with the 22nd overall pick of the 2010 MLS SuperDraft following a senior season at Harvard in which he led his team to the NCAA Tournament’s Round of 16 and was the first runner up for the Hermann Trophy, given to the nation’s best player. The Currier House resident finished his Crimson career as the program’s all-time leading scorer with 127 points and tied Chris Ohiri ’64 for the most goals in Harvard history, with 47.
He made his professional debut in a U.S. Open Cup game against the Kansas City Wizards in April 2010 and scored his first career goal a year later against the Chicago Fire. Last season, Akpan tallied a career-high three goals in 15 appearances for Colorado. During his time with the Rapids, the forward won an MLS Cup in 2010 and also played on loan for Real Maryland and FC Tampa Bay.
“We would like to thank Andre for what he gave to the Rapids since coming to the team ahead of the 2010 season,” Rapids technical director Paul Bravo said in a statement. “He scored some good goals for us and was a positive presence in the locker room over the last couple seasons, and we wish him the very best in New York.”
The 2006 Ivy League Rookie of the Year and four-time first-team All-Ivy standout had only appeared in one game for the Rapids this year, appearing as a substitute in a March 2 game against FC Dallas. But on Twitter, he thanked the organization for giving him an opportunity.
“Just want to send a huge thank you to @ColoradoRapids and their fans. It's been a great 3.5 years, and I truly appreciated my time here,” Akpan tweeted. “Gonna miss a lot of ppl. I had some great experiences (winning MLS Cup wasn't too bad). Good luck to my boys this season.”
Akpan is not the first former Crimson star to change MLS teams this season. In January, Mike Fucito ’09 was traded from the Portland Timbers to the San Jose Earthquakes—his third time being dealt in a calendar year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling at the last possible moment Friday against Columbia (10-4, 3-0 Ivy), the Harvard women’s tennis team (9-5, 1-1) bounced back with a 6-1 victory over Cornell (12-2, 1-2). Now healthy, the Crimson began April the way it ended March, when it won four of five matches to close out the month. Freshman Hai-Li Kong said that the team is peaking at the right time as it heads into Ancient Eight competition.
“I think we played amazing [this weekend],” Kong said. “I think we had the best two performances that we had this year. Everyone was so tough and it was great to watch and be a part of.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 1
On Saturday, the team battled back and scored a 6-1 victory against the host Big Red. Harvard won all but one singles match, winning four of the five in straight sets and winning seven sets while giving up two games or fewer. Kong said that the team came out with an added sense of urgency in the second leg of the doubleheader to make sure the team did not fall to 0-2 in conference play.
“Because of our loss against Columbia, we were even more motivated the next day,” Kong said. “We’ve been training really hard. We just want it really badly, especially for our senior captains. This is their last Ivy season and we really want to win this title for them.”
In doubles, co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana got back to their winning ways with an 8-5 victory, while Kong and junior Hannah Morill pulled out a victory at the number three line. In singles, the freshmen trio of Kong, Amanda Lin, and Amy He all pulled out wins to give the Crimson an insurmountable 4-0 lead in the best-of-seven format.
“I am incredibly proud of all of the freshmen,” Tachibana said. “They really held their own, and especially in their first Ivy match, you get extremely nervous, and the fans are heckling, and the line judges aren’t supportive, but they handled it really well, and they really represented Harvard women’s tennis well.”
Tachibana said that the team has been preparing all season for Ivy League play and was glad to get out on the courts and play the games that count.
“This is what we have been working for the entire year,” Tachibana said. “Fall season isn’t as fun because you are playing individually and not playing for Harvard every point that you win. In the spring season, every match you play, you are trying to compare each opponent to how it would be in the Ivy League. For me, it is my last season ever, and working hard in practice has all been for this season—for this last part of the season.”
COLUMBIA 4, HARVARD 3
On Friday against Columbia, the team fell down 3-0 after losing the doubles match and two singles contests before battling back to secure the next three matches—twice fighting back from a set down to do so. Kong took two close tiebreaker sets to win at the line four position, while Lin and sophomore Sylvia Li overcame one-set deficits to take the line five and line six matches.
With the score knotted up, 3-3, the only match remaining was the line two contest, where He—who led the team with eight wins coming into the match—faced off against Cornell’s Bianca Sanon. He lost the first set on two breaks, 2-6, but battled back to take the second, 6-4. In the deciding set, Sanon won a 7-3 tiebreaker to send the Lions to the victory.
“Losing to Columbia was tough, but on that given day they were a better team,” Tachibana said. “It was our first Ivy match, so we had a lot of nerves going in, and the fact that we were so close and they were the most talented team gives us a lot of hope for the rest of the season.”
In doubles play, the duo of Tachibana and Norton suffered their first loss of the season at the line one position, falling, 8-5, after six consecutive victories to open the season. Lin and Li fell, 8-3, at the line two position, and Kong and Morrill were down a break, 6-3, when play was stopped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (14-8, 7-4 EIVA) clinched a berth in the conference playoffs over the weekend after splitting its two home fixtures against Princeton (11-8, 9-4) and George Mason (14-11, 10-3).
The Crimson was able to extend its home win streak to 12 against the Tigers on Friday, but it was unlucky number 13 for the home team against the Patriots on Saturday.
“Obviously, last night to win out in five [against Princeton] was huge in terms of our season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “I feel like today [against George Mason] wasn’t that different a match. Last night, we got the key points at the end of the games, and today, we gave them up.”
GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 1
Down, 21-20, in the fourth game, Harvard called a timeout to stem a 3-0 Patriots run. A large crowd had turned out for Senior Night and waited with bated breath for the resumption of play as the Crimson’s 12-game win streak was on the line.
Two attack errors and a service error sealed the home team’s fate, as it was George Mason who wound up victorious, ending the squad’s streak.
That had been the story of the match, as two very evenly matched teams had gone toe-to-toe with only the key points separating them.
“We made very few errors for most of the game, then all of a sudden at 21-21 [in the second set], we missed a serve, we missed a couple of passes, and at that point the game is over,” Baise said. “Same with game four, they made a couple of good blocks, and at that point of the game, their team was able to seize that moment.”
Harvard had jumped out in front by winning the opening set, but was unable to resist the George Mason surge from then on despite having chances in the second and fourth sets.
“Those are the high pressure moments when you hope that the team is going to be able to pull through,” junior libero Chris Gibbons said. “They were getting those points today, so we’ve just got to focus in on high pressure situations for next time because we’ll probably see them again in the playoffs.”
The Patriots served extremely well throughout the match, with only 11 errors compared to five aces, putting pressure on the home team.
“I thought they served great,” Baise said. “Our passers did a good job, but [good serving] puts a lot of pressure on them, and then they backed that up with big blocks. That’s always going to be a challenge.”
Though this loss marks the end of the streak, the Crimson has its sights firmly set on the upcoming playoffs.
“This was our first loss at home, so it’s kind of a bummer,” Gibbons said. “But the guys know that everything is really just a buildup to playoffs, and that’s what really matters. As long as we are taking this experience and learning from it and getting better, that’s the important part.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
It was Student Rewards Night on Friday against the only other Ivy school with a men’s volleyball team, and the raucous crowd was certainly not disappointed by a five-set thriller between the two rivals.
The game came right down to the wire with Harvard up, 13-12, in the fifth and final set.
Princeton junior Pat Schagler wound up to serve, but amidst rabid heckling from the home fans, committed crucial error to pave the way for a Crimson victory.
“To show that kind of courage and fight, especially in the playoff stretch now, is what we’ve been working towards all season,” Baise said. “We’ve seen it here and there, we’ve started to see it in practices the last few weeks, and it’s a great feeling. I can’t say enough about the team.”
The win was all the more sweet for Baise, as he is a Tiger graduate from the class of ’95.
“I always love playing those guys,” Baise said. “It makes a little bit more of a rivalry, a little bit more intense. It’s a lot of fun. I feel like both programs are in a real good place right now, it’s an even match, and they beat us down there earlier in the season, so a little bit of revenge is always nice.”
The playoff field is now set for the EIVA tournament, and the teams must battle it out for seeding behind powerhouse No. 12 Penn State.
“We’re in the playoffs now, and that will be a great test for us,” Baise added. “We’re playing for a seed, and literally we’re playing for momentum at this point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team was lucky to make the short drive to Providence this weekend for the Brown Invite, because the trip was much longer for some of the team’s opponents.
Facing off against two squads from the east coast and two from the west, the Crimson (14-13, 3-2 CWPA) defeated George Washington on Saturday but then lost three straight times, twice to ranked teams.
The action served as Harvard’s final tune-up before its postseason tournaments, which commence with the Southern Division Championships next weekend.
“We’re always trying to look to get good wins, no matter if it’s in a tournament or a regular season game,” co-captain Aisha Price said. “But we’re not trying to look ahead. We want to play this weekend as best we can against really good teams and learn what we can from this weekend building into next weekend.”
ARIZONA STATE 17, HARVARD 8
The Crimson’s final game of the regular season came against No. 3 Arizona State (23-5)—a team whose only losses on the year have come to teams ranked in the top five nationally.
Harvard found itself in the game going into the intermission, trailing 8-5. But the Sun Devils took control in the second half, outscoring the Crimson by six goals to secure the victory.
Junior Shayna Price, the squad’s leading scorer for the third game in a row, tallied four goals and contributed an assist. Her sister, Aisha Price, posted two goals and three steals to help spur the offense in the first half.
“If you want to be the best, you have to play against the best,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “You have to do the little things, and we see them do the little things and have to adjust quickly. The speed, the strength of the game and all that is something that helps you down the line.”
CSU BAKERSFIELD 17, HARVARD 12
In a game that saw considerable offense from both teams, the Roadrunners (12-20) ended up on top in an early start on Sunday morning.
Despite a career day from freshman Charlotte Hendrix, who contributed ten points on the game, Cal State Bakersfield outscored Harvard in the first three periods of play to ride to a 17-12 victory.
Hendrix registered a hat trick along with a career-high seven assists on the day to spearhead the Crimson attack. Shayna Price found the back of the net five times.
The Roadrunners built themselves a lead before intermission, outscoring Harvard by three goals in the first period and by two tallies in the second.
The second half seemed to be an entirely different game, as the two teams combined to produce 18 goals. After the two periods went down as even, with both the Crimson and CSU scoring nine times apiece, Harvard ultimately could never recover from the early deficit.
PRINCETON 17, HARVARD 9
In its second matchup of the year against the No. 12 Tigers (20-5), the Crimson could not keep pace with a high-powered Princeton offense and fell by an eight-goal margin.
The first period turned out to be the killer for Harvard, as the Tigers found scoring from a variety of sources to jump out to a 7-2 lead.
The Crimson outscored Princeton by one in the second period to bridge the gap, but a stout defensive effort from the Tigers after the intermission held the Crimson to just two more goals.
The Tigers received two big performances from junior Katie Rigler and freshman Pippa Temple, who combined to tally nine of the team’s 17 scores.
On the other end, Shayna Price led Harvard with a hat trick, and co-captain Elise Molnar and freshman Rachel Lobato added on two goals apiece.
HARVARD 12, GEORGE WASHINGTON 6
In its first game of the tournament, the Crimson took advantage of a huge fourth quarter to ride to a 12-6 victory over the Colonials (13-12).
Harvard entered the fourth period up only two. But fueled by a pair of tallies from Aisha Price, the team went on to outscore George Washington by a 5-1 margin in the quarter to seize control of the game.
“We were up the whole game, but we just wanted to finish the game strong,” Price said. “We just kept on attacking and were able to really pull away in the fourth quarter.”
Price led the Crimson with a game-high five goals, and Hendrix contributed a hat trick of her own while also posting a team-high three steals.
Both squads struggled to find offense in the first quarter and played to a 2-2 tie after the first eight minutes.
But the Crimson outscored the Colonials in the second period to take a 6-3 lead entering intermission. George Washington brought itself within two in the third period, setting up the opportunity for Harvard to pull away in the fourth.

Timely hitting with runners in scoring position has not been Harvard baseball’s forte this season. But down four in the bottom of the seventh in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader against defending Ivy League champion Cornell, the Crimson’s bats got hot and a little help from Big Red defensive errors sparked a seven-run inning that gave Harvard the win, 10-7.
“To win like this, to erupt with some offense and show that we can swing the bats—there are a lot of positives to make us excited about going forward,” co-captain Jordan Haviland said.
The 10 runs were the most the Crimson (6-21, 3-5 Ivy) has put together in a single game this season. Prior to Saturday’s late-game success Harvard was averaging just 2.5 runs per game.
The Crimson split Saturday’s games, dropping the early game to the Big Red (17-10, 5-3), 3-1, before coming back to win the second.
HARVARD 10, CORNELL 7
Sophomore right-hander Matt Timoney took the mound for Harvard, and kept Cornell in check in the early-goings, allowing just one hit through two innings. With the Crimson up 1-0, Harvard was cruising. But in the top of the third inning, Big Red slugger Chris Cruz knocked a homer out of the yard with two men on, giving Cornell a lead to build on. The Big Red scored two runs in each of the next two innings, and after a scoreless sixth inning entered the seventh up 7-3.
Freshman catcher DJ Link led off the inning with a walk. The rookie went 3-for-4 at the plate with three RBI and currently leads the Crimson with 12 RBI on the year. Junior Jeff Hajdin grounded out to the pitcher and Link advanced to second. Cornell pitcher TJ Parthemer walked the next two batters to load the bases and bring sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel to the plate.
Kregel drove in Link, keeping the bases loaded and prompting a pitching change. New Cornell pitcher Eric Upton (1-1) came in in relief and, after giving up a single to sophomore Nick Saathof, who brought the score to 7-5, struck out sophomore Tanner Anderson for the second out of the inning. But the Crimson rally was not done there.
“In the bottom of the seventh we really pulled together and racked up some runs, got a lot of energy, a lot of positive energy, that we didn’t see much of in the beginning of the game,” junior pitcher Baron Davis said. “The guys stepped up, and we got it together at the end.”
Junior Carlton Bailey singled to short and beat out the throw, driving in freshman third baseman Mitch Klug and re-loading the bases once again. Co-captain Rob Wineski forced a throwing error from the second baseman, bringing home an unearned run. That brought Link back up to the plate, as Harvard batted through the order for the first time all season.
Link singled to right, driving in two more and putting runners on first and third. Hajdin came up to bat and reached on an error from third base, bringing Wineski home and putting the finishing touch on the inning.
Davis (2-2) logged three innings of work, giving up two hits and two earned to get his team-leading second win of the season. Haviland came in to close out the game, giving up one hit in two scoreless innings and earning his second save.
The Big Red threatened in the top of the eighth as Haviland faced runners on first and second with one out. But the Crimson’s luck was not out yet. Haviland threw a ball to bring the count to 3-2 on Cornell batter JD Whetsel. Whetsel incorrectly thought it was ball four and started walking towards first as the runners began advancing as well. After some confusion and impassioned yelling from the dugouts, Harvard tagged out a runner to get Haviland out of a jam.
“I’ve never seen that kind of thing happen before,” Haviland said. “But obviously we’ll take it.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 1
The first game of the double-header was dominated by Cornell pitcher Nick Buston (4-0) who pitched a complete-game five-hitter while striking out seven to give the Big Red a 3-1 victory. A fourth-inning two-run double from Cornell outfielder Conor McCabe proved to be the difference. Harvard managed to get four runners on base—including two in the bottom of the seventh—but could not bring anyone around to get back into contention.
Despite the clear skies, weather played a large role in both games, with cold temperatures and balls getting lost in the sun contributing to occasionally sloppy play.
“I think on cold days like this, it comes down to who wants it more,” Haviland said. “[In the second game] we battled the elements better, and we know this field and we know how to play hard on it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just like the weather in Cambridge last week, the outdoor track and field season is beginning to heat up.
With two weeks of outdoor competition under its belt, the Harvard track and field team once again split up over the weekend, sending athletes to the Florida Relays in Gainesville, Fla. and the Sam Howell Invitational, which was hosted by Princeton.
“There were some spectacular performances, especially down in Florida,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Both groups got in some good competition and I’m really excited for how things are shaping up for the championship part of our season.”
FLORIDA RELAYS
The Crimson saw some of the strongest teams in the nation at the Florida Relays, facing a massive field that included the host Gators, whose men and women are ranked No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, by the USTFCCCA.
Harvard turned in four top-10 finishes at the elite invitational, including its men’s and women’s 1600-meter sprint medley relay teams. The men’s team took home fifth place in the event, finishing in 3:24.49, while the women’s team finished in sixth place with a time of 3:57.68.
The most impressive performance of the weekend came from the women’s 4x400-meter relay team, which set a new school record in the event. The team of freshmen Autumne Franklin and Christi Scott, junior Olivia Abbate, and sophomore Gabrielle Scott averaged roughly 55 second splits to finish in 3:40.42. While the performance was stellar by Ivy standards, it earned just 14th place at the stacked meet.
“The level of competition is unbelievable,” Saretsky said. “I feel like our student-athletes rose to the occasion and had some outstanding performances.”
Franklin also impressed in the 100 and 400-meter hurdles events, taking 15th and 11th place, respectively, with a pair of personal-best times.
SAM HOWELL INVITATIONAL
Sophomore thrower Igor Liokumovich placed in both the shot put and discus at the meet. Liokumovich took home fourth in the discus and second in the shot put behind a 16.65-meter hurl.
“In terms of the outdoor season, I feel like I’m in a good place to finish strong,” Liokumovich said. ”

Perhaps you grew up in a more rustic locale, where the approach of summer meant prospects of fresh juicy berries and vine-ripe tomatoes. Perhaps that just sounds deliciously un-HUDS-like. If you'll be around Harvard this summer, you may be in luck.
This year, Clover Food Lab is bringing produce from local farms to city dwellers through its Community-Sourced Agriculture program, which allows consumers to buy a share in one of the small farms and then receive a portion of the farm's crops every week during harvest season.
According to Clover's website, this model originated in Massachusetts in the 1980s to help farms expand and provide consumers with high quality produce.
"This model allows busy, urban consumers to pick up their weekly shares of fresh produce at a Clover restaurant, rather than having to drive to the farm," Ryan E. Heffrin '13, current intern at Clover's CSA program, wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Not only does the program serve consumers here in Cambridge, it is also mutually beneficial to the farmers involved.
"Farmers get money they can use to buy seeds, hire people, and prepare for the harvest season," Heffrin wrote.
The response to Clover's pioneering of the CSA program in the area has been strongly positive.
According to its website, Clover has extended the sign-up deadline until May 1 to accommodate the high demand.
To buy into this program, customers will have to pay anywhere from $300 to $700. Customers can always add on additional products, such as flowers, eggs, and fruit.
Clover has signed up over 150 customers for the program and hopes to add 50 to 100 more. Undergraduates may not be able to foot the bill to sign up, but perhaps a tutor or proctor can be convinced.
Fruit salad study break, anyone?

For most students, gaining admission to Harvard is a dream come true. Or, is it?
In a recent survey published by the Princeton Review, Harvard took second place to Stanford for top "dream" school among college applicants and their parents.
For all those who bleed Crimson, this may come as a tough blow. We at Flyby took to investigating this ranking to determine what makes Stanford such great material for so many prospective college students' dreams.
Good morning, sunshine. What is this seasonal affective disorder you speak of? While many would hate to miss a beautiful New England autumn, it is hard to argue with the warmth of Palo Alto when storms like Nemo dump two feet of snow on Cambridge.
We've got spirit, how 'bout you? Despite Harvard men's basketball repeat March Madness appearances and the historic win over No. 3 seeded New Mexico this year, Harvard's school spirit falls short in comparison with Stanford's Cardinal athletics stand out with over 100 national championships and about 450 individual sport championships, the most in the NCAA. With regards to traditional rivalry and spirit, "The Game," which remains so dear to the hearts of Harvard students, is mirrored by the annual Stanford-Cal "Big Game."
There's something in the air. Stretching across 8,180 acres, the Stanford campus allows students a bit more freedom than we have here on the city streets of Cambridge, which can be a plus if you're into that kind of thing. For many rising freshmen, there is a lot more to love than the dirty water of the Charles and the sometimes strict and antiquated laws of the Commonwealth. For instance, it is perfectly legal to be publically nude in California. How radical, dude.
But is California Dreamin' really worth it? Maybe not. After all, we do have evidence to suggest that our friends on the West Coast are just a bunch of would-be Harvard students. Last year at Stanford, following the campus-wide tradition of creating House themes, student dorm Mars House was transformed into "Marvard University." To that we say: why go with the imitator, when you can have the original?
