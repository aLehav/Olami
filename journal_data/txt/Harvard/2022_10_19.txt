After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that The Harvard Crimson Arts board has the honor of interviewing one of their own. Once a Crimson Arts writer and now a New York Times bestselling author, Deborah Copaken ’88 shares notes on her life through a viscerally honest memoir: “Ladyparts.”
On an academic level, “Ladyparts” uncovers the startling yet pervasive sexism of the American healthcare system. After battling breast cancer, the removal of her cervix and uterus, and multiple other health complications, Copaken explains how the lack of adequate knowledge of female anatomy led to life-threatening consequences. Despite the specific focus on her medical condition, this memoir touches on all aspects of Copaken’s life. In her own words, “Ladyparts” exhibits “a dash of sexual harassment, a cup of corporate indifference, and several morsels of middle-aged app dating in between.”
Copaken writes with unconventional honesty and confidence that make her work unlike most on the market. She refuses to rely on flowery language, poetic verse, and ethereal descriptions of life’s greatest hardships; the pages of “Ladyparts” are not bound by a need to please or sell. Instead, Copaken creates a candid flow of consciousness. She seeks to inspire future authors and journalists to prioritize truth over superfluous emotional appeals.
In place of figurative chapter titles, Copaken assigns each section of her book to a body part: Vagina, Uterus, Breast, Heart, Cervix, Brain, and Lungs. When asked about how she conceived of this anatomical framework, Copaken reflected, “It all came to me in the shower, when I was looking down at my scars… I have all these scars on my stomach, and they represent each horror that shouldn't have happened. I shouldn't have had to wait sixteen years for an adenomyosis diagnosis… I shouldn't have bled out after my cervix removal, because I went to the emergency room — I told them something was wrong, but they didn't have a speculum in the emergency room. I mean, think about that. Half the United States, half the people in New York have vaginas, and you don't have a speculum in the emergency room?”
Copaken also elaborated on America’s stigmatization of women’s bodies outside of a hospital setting: “We have to start talking about what happens to our bodies. Particularly in my generation, you didn't carry a tampon from the classroom to the bathroom — you hid it in your sleeve. You didn't let anyone know that you were bleeding. It's a particularly American way of looking at the body.”
In addition to highlighting the bleeding sexism of speculum-less hospitals, Copaken uncovers the burden that inaccessible healthcare places on all Americans. In “Ladyparts,” Copaken writes, “For a country founded on the ideals of freedom, liberty, and justice for all, having affordable health insurance tied to full-time employment is an ironic and often fatal prison of our own making. Not to mention an obvious hindrance to that other pillar of American pride, entrepreneurship. How many new ideas and cures and inventions have we missed out on because some cog in the wheel of a giant corporation couldn’t risk taking that leap of faith without a parachute of health insurance for them and their family?”
By U.S. standards, Copaken’s openness about her health issues and financial status may seem taboo, creating much criticism of her writing and specifically including pictures of her breast cancer biopsy in her memoir.
In a quasi-critical review, Jessica Bennett of the New York Times warns that these images are only for the “squeamish,” asking readers, “Is it sexist of me to be grossed out by such an image? Maybe.”
Copaken’s answer: “Yes; by asking that, you’re being sexist.”
But it seems that when there’s this passion, this intrinsic magnetism towards a certain topic, no criticism can stand in Copaken’s way.
The author began her career in high school, writing as a columnist for Seventeen Magazine. Harvard proved to be her first roadblock, dulling the author’s belief in her writing.
“I got to Harvard, and I failed spectacularly,” she said, reflecting on her college experience. “There was one creative writing course; I applied three times and I didn't get in. I got a C minus in freshmen Expos.... I loved to write but suddenly, once I was in Cambridge, I was not a good writer. And so when I left college, I spent 10 years not writing. I spent 10 years as a photojournalist, as a war photographer.”
While the photos sprinkled throughout “Ladyparts” provide an echo of her past career, Copaken eventually found her way back to her passion for writing. When asked to give a piece of advice to those experiencing the same sense of failure, Copaken responded, “Failure is fuel. Failure becomes your superpower.”
And where did this passion for writing begin?
“I think we should roll back to age four… at age four, I was given a book, Dr. Seuss’s ‘My Book About Me.’ And one of the pages was blank and it says, ‘write a story,” she said.
“It is the first time that I remember sitting down at my parents’ dining room table with a pen, not a pencil, a pen and this book, because I was like, ‘Oh, it's a book, I've got to make it permanent.’ And the joy of that I can still recall — the joy of having a blank page and filling it.”
When Copaken speaks of her writing as a four-year old — she makes a conscious note that she wrote her first story in pen. It is through this metaphor that Copaken reveals the permanence of writing. Despite the constant fluctuation of sexism and hardship in society today, Copaken identifies the power and inherent permanence of her own voice.
Copaken shared an inspiring message — that no matter the adversity one faces, “You can fight against it with your word, you can write about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked behind colonial homes, a neighborhood church, and car shops, a large, open field bustled with noise and feet-stomping tunes. On Oct. 8, flannels of every color, ranging from blues and greens to oranges and reds, came from every direction, attracted by the smell of spiked cider and the sound of vibrant laughter. Levitate’s 2002 Flannel Jam was magical, and brought together family and friends to experience bluegrass, warm food, and fall feels.
Flannel Jam is an annual music festival hosted by Levitate, a surf shop based in Marshfield, Massachusetts. Levitate hosts yearly events, including their largest summer music festival, Levitate Music and Arts Festival, that began as a party for the 10 year anniversary of the surf shop. It has since grown to an annual weekend event that attracts over 17,000 people per day, according to associate producer Brittany Ryan.
Comparatively, Flannel Jam is much smaller. Expected turnout this year was 3,000 people per venue of the touring festival. In some ways, this locality is what draws people to the festival. Jacqueline Magliozzi and Catherine MacDonald, candle vendors with a tent set up at the event, said they really enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere. The pair came from 30 minutes away to set up shop, their first time selling at a music festival.
This Flannel Jam was Torie Shepherd’s third year selling her reversible bucket hats and floral headbands at the festival, meaning she’s been around for every Flannel Jam. Her first time vending was at Flannel Jam and she worked for a while as the vendor coordinator for Levitate.
“We have a stage right in front of us, we get to watch the good music and meet good people,” Shepherd said about being a vendor at the festival. “The music’s great, the food is great, all the vendors — I love working with Levitate.”
On top of that, Shepherd notes that there is a very tight community surrounding the festival.
“There’s a lot of customers that came back and have said that they’ve been to several flannel jams,” she said.
Many attendees of the festival found out about it through shopping at the surf shop, including an eighth grader at the local middle school. She brought two friends with her. They wore flannel, painted pumpkins, and ate burritos. The student gave her pink pumpkin to her camp counselor who she ran into during the festival. The girls also saw their science teacher and a substitute. “It was awkward,” she laughed.
This sort of closeness and low-keyness is what the producers of Flannel Jam were aiming for, according to associate producer Brittany Ryan. “We wanted to do something that celebrates the beauty of New England,” Ryan said.
The area was in peak foliage, and orange leaves fell from the trees in the venue on the chilly Saturday afternoon. Even though it is a weekend festival, the location changes each of the three days. On Sunday, the travel crew and the four national touring bands headed to Portland, Maine, then to Nantucket on Monday.
Ryan Ross, a staff member at Levitate selling merch and answering questions at the Flannel Jam, is a part of the traveling crew. He and his coworker Colby Suzio spent 12 hours the previous day helping set up the fences. Ross will do the same at Portland and Nantucket too.
“We don’t get a good view,” he said about the job. “But we can hear [the music] and it gets my feet moving.”
A musical highlight was The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow. The local Massachusetts band played on the smaller of the two stages, the “Holla” Stage.
“Do you guys remember rock and roll music? Let’s channel the flannel and take it back!” The guitarist yelled into the mic before playing an energetic, upbeat, folky cover of “Rock and Roll Radio.” The crowd stomped their feet. Some of them linked arms and skipped in a circle, and screamed along with the lyrics.
Next to the Holla stage, Kara Hoblin worked on her chalk wall. She drew a detailed fox, sitting in a field of mushrooms under a smiling moon. This was her fifth year working for Levitate’s festivals and second year working the Flannel Jam. She has never come to a festival with a pre-planned board; she lets the festival inspire her artwork. This time, she arrived at the festival early and got her inspiration when she came across one of the event directors painting a big mushroom for a stage decoration. She says she loves watching how people interact with her drawings.
“Especially the kids are so interested in the artwork and it makes me feel good that my work is being appreciated and making people smile,” she said.
Cris and John Conlon came to the festival to celebrate their seven-year anniversary decked out in vibrant flannels, flower crowns, and sunglasses to block out the autumn sun. As a couple, the Conlons were full of comforting smiles.
“The traditional present is a wool gift… when I saw flannel, I thought: Well that’s close enough,” said John.
This was one of many music festivals that they have been to this past year. When asked about what has made Flannel Jam stand out, John said, “Cool crowd [and] good vibes.” There were five food trucks near the entrance of the venue, Cris and John were looking forward to the apple doughnuts the most.
“It’s awesome. This is a really good event. Really good food,” said Cris.
With the New England fall foliage and folk sound, Flannel Jam lures its audience in by the offer of hot cider donuts, cider & whiskey, caramel apples, and array of food trucks ranging from burritos to spring rolls. Some people were waiting in long lines for food. For some, the food was what they were the most excited for. The festival itself is a reminder of early autumn, but tasting the cider donuts really makes it a staple for the fall experience.
Other than the delicious food, the offer of whiskey definitely draws people in.
When Milak and Emma, a couple attending from Virginia, were asked about what they were the most excited for, without hesitation they said, “The spiked cider.”
Despite the spiked cider, though, Flannel Jam is at its core a family-friendly event. Not only was this apparent through the abundance of food and drink options, but also the kids zone, hilariously titled: The Rugrat Rodeo.
Kids rolled in corn, parents stood around, sprinkling kernels onto their kids. Some kids buried themselves in it, others scooped up handfuls and threw it at their brothers or sisters or some random kid they met through their newfound love of corn boxes.
The Kids Corral was filled with many fun activities for children and parents to enjoy while still being able to hear the live music just a little ways away. Along with the corn boxes, there was a hay playground for kids to hop around on while their parents watched and socialized. Other major activities included painting pumpkins and writing on a chalk wall, which genuinely helps build community and get kids involved at the festival.
Watching her six-year-old daughter paint a pumpkin in the Kids Corral was Cheryl Balkom. “My daughter loves music and this is a very friendly environment to expose her to,” Balkom said. “The vibe is always laid-back, fun and welcoming.”
The festival music ended at eight, perfect time for families to get home for bedtime. So at sunset, children were still jamming out to the folk music, some even at the front for one of the headliners Molly Tuttle & Golden Highway, kicking their cowboy boots in dance.
Molly Tuttle, a young, award-winning bluegrass musician, was a highly anticipated show of the festival. She recently released a new album called “Crooked Tree.” The album featured big names in the bluegrass genre like Old Crow Medicine Show, Billy Strings, Margo Price and Gillian Welch.
On stage, Tuttle’s guitar playing laced together all the instruments in her five person classic bluegrass band. Each band member: the fiddle, the banjo, Tuttle on the guitar, the bass and the mandolin shared the stage equally, with Tuttle in the center. They all held huge smiles. And together, they harmonized on the choruses.
“I know I feel like a crooked tree sometimes and I think all of us are crooked trees in some way or another, so this goes out to all the crooked trees out there,” Tuttle said, introducing the song sharing a name with her newest album.
The headliner, Greensky Bluegrass, featured a soloing steel guitar that the player held horizontally around his neck. By the time they came on, the Massachusetts sun had set, the air was chillier, and people held their flannels tighter around them. But it wasn't too long before the dancing picked up and it wasn't too hard to stay warm anymore.

“Scientifically speaking, there are two ways to keep warm,” a Greensky member said into the mic. “One is flannel. The other is bluegrass. So y’all are in the right place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bikini shot. Birthday shout-out. Snappy posts complete with a slider tool to indicate on a scale (with emojis for units!) how you’re feeling today. A slide deck listing the symptoms of growing up with emotionally unavailable parents. Bikini shot. Another birthday post — wait, there’s two birthdays today? Next, a post titled “It’s Time We Talk About Casual Ableism”— a comprehensive lesson complete with pastel colors and speech balloons.
To an Instagram user who joined the platform for updates on “The Bachelor” or pictures of their newborn nephews, these posts may seem out of place, misinformed, or just blatantly tasteless. I have an iPhone 6, so consider me prehistoric, and I don’t frequent Instagram enough to be fully cognizant of evolving trends and post formats. Regardless, at some point in the transition from heavily-filtered collages of cat pictures to longer-form, interactive posts, a creative form of activism emerged — posting dramatic news headlines with aesthetic images and cutesy fonts.
Performative activism — activism done to improve one’s social capital rather than advance a cause— is certainly flawed. To the viewer who picks up the daily newspaper, these sporadic calls-to-action may seem to severely lack substance. The undoubtedly superior, prestigious viewer may scoff at a shimmering “Sex Workers Need Rights” post covered in digital stickers.
But would you rather they not address it and learn nothing at all?
At the bare minimum, one must familiarize themselves with current affairs to design one of these posts. Thus, regardless of whether or not the careless creator failed to critically analyze all evidence before submitting their social media infographic for peer review, they had to, at least to some degree, consider the message they were sending. As a Facebook user, I constantly read ill-informed “opinion pieces” reposted by my friends and family members. I would much prefer the younger generation of Instagram users explore their ideas factually in infographics and contribute to conversations that will hopefully extend beyond their following.
If a friend replies to an infographic with a “So true” or a “Yass!” — that is social progress! Threading controversial and pertinent ideas through the channels of friends can shape how casual discussions materialize and expand.
Indeed, it is uncomfortable to see Covid-19 mortality rates or global poverty statistics displayed in the foreground of a laughable doodle. The childlike, whimsical representation of devastating news is certainly unsettling. But who is going to post a starving infant on their Instagram story? Especially in sequence after the sorority shot from their Florida Keys self-discovery team retreat?
No, I do not champion these artsy infographics as the height of modern education; nor do I believe their presentation is necessarily sensitive, just, or effective. But if you’re frustrated that casually reading academic journals has not yet become a trend, become an influencer. And if you think influencers are brainless Instagram addicts who lack the ability to meaningfully impact their audience, consider the millions who repost their bikini pictures and their politically-driven statements alike.
As much as we love to reminisce on the print newspapers of the past, the fact of the matter is a significant percentage of Americans are reading the news on social media. It is time to accept that information being spread through social media is the potential next phase of formal news consumption. If Instagram can compel 55 million people to like a picture of an egg, why can we not take advantage of its effects and create an avenue for political discussion as well?
I’ll admit it — it’s disquieting when I open Instagram only to be hit with my younger sister’s friends posting about genocide, especially since I have only ever used Instagram for aimless pleasure. But the purpose and presence of social media is evolving. We cannot deny that many people have fallen victim to a habit of scrolling through slews of followers’ photos and videos on the daily. Maybe infographics are just the start of a movement to make social media platforms more meaningful.
As a Harvard student with an active Apple News app, I’ll confess that I learned something in an infographic I hadn’t read in headlines about the Russia-Ukraine crisis just a few days ago. And I fact-checked it, just for the skeptics who persistently think that infographic curators are not equipped to learn, teach, and share about something weighty – albeit in sparkly fashion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cities of Tehran and Kabul were once free, cosmopolitan capitals where women dressed as they pleased. My mother, an Afghan immigrant to the United States, speaks of these times fondly. But ever since the rise of authoritarian regimes in these countries, both Iran and Afghanistan have entered a dark period.
Many of us at Harvard are aware of the protests that have erupted across Iran and the Middle East following Zhina Mahsa Amini’s death; some of us, myself included, have even rallied on the steps of Widener Library to call for justice for Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish descent, was detained by the Iranian morality police under the hijab law, which requires women to cover their hair under hijabs or headscarves and wear loose-fitting robes. She was taken into custody and reported dead three days later. There exist allegations that she was beaten during her detention, sparking widespread protests in Iran and beyond.
The United States has previously launched efforts to aid the persecuted women of Iran’s Islamic Republic. These efforts, however, are facades for a deeper political agenda, intended to induce Iranian surrender to U.S. demands and economic coercion. The U.S. State Department has repeatedly placed a spotlight on the suppression of Iranian women’s rights, with social media posts reminiscing on an era where Iranian women dressed openly and offering belittling praise to successful Iranian-American women. The U.S. administration has long appropriated the Iranian women’s movement to further their own political and economic programs, while blatantly disregarding the oppression faced by women under Middle Eastern governments allied with the U.S.
This is not the first or only occurrence of Western nations exerting their power in developing countries under the guise of empowering women. European colonial powers have long presented the hijab as a symbol of oppression in Asia and North Africa. In the 19th century, the British launched campaigns against the hijab in Egypt, fixated on the claim that it was an injustice against women. Such notions served as fundamental underpinnings of white saviorism, and also contributed to the development of misinformed conceptions of Middle Eastern and Muslim women.
Both historical reflection and a deeper analysis of contemporary women’s rights propaganda reveal an important truth: These countries do not need saving. Muslim women do not need saving. Control of the female body and oppression of women is not inherent to Islam, nor the countries of the East. And Western intervention will most certainly not be the solution.
Liberation is not equivalent to removal of the hijab. The dispute over the garment is rooted in its historically politicized nature, a narrative perpetuated by Western ignorance and propaganda. Islam’s deeper message about the hijab as a notion of modesty is drowned out by Western cultural assumptions that demonize the hijab as a tool of oppression and exploitation. To a Muslim woman, however, the hijab grants them control of their body. It serves as both a physical manifestation of a woman’s faith and a symbol of their personal commitment to lead a pure life.
There are women residing in Iran who firmly believe in the virtue of their hijab, while there are also women who would give up their hijabs at once — if given the choice. Liberation, therefore, is equivalent to the ability to exercise this choice and bodily autonomy.
The women’s movement in Iran runs much deeper than a piece of cloth covering the hair. It is rooted in a long-brewing exhaustion with authoritarian regimes that continue to deny women freedom and agency. Mahsa Amini’s death and the protests that have erupted in response are not a demonstration against Islam, but rather, the broader issue of policing a woman’s ability to choose — to choose to wear the hijab, however one pleases.
As a Muslim woman of Persian heritage, I stand in solidarity with Mahsa Amini. I commend the Iranian women actively protesting and fighting for change, and for demonstrating purposeful resilience against authority that has historically politicized and policed women’s bodies. And I hope for a day where I can share my mother’s memories, a day where women truly embody the freedom they so rightfully deserve. As we, in Harvard, the United States, and the West, extend our support for the women in Iran, we must ensure we are fighting for this freedom of choice — not the Western notion of freedom from the hijab.

Amid the many prominent attractions on Harvard’s Allston campus, including the $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex and the Harvard Business School, a small creative haven took root at Barry’s Corner decades ago: the Harvard Ceramics Program.
The Ceramics Program, under the purview of the College’s Office of the Arts, was founded by undergraduates in 1970 and officially joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 1999. Today, 85 percent of the studio’s income derives from registration fees for ceramics classes, according to program director Kathy King.
“Barry's Corner is kind of like this meeting point of both Harvard and this general community, and I've been sitting here since 2013 watching it change,” King said. “Of course you have the Art Lab and SEAS and all that good stuff, but we've been here from the beginning watching it occur and watching it grow.”
Allston residents, as well as Harvard students, are welcome to sign up for courses at the studio, which range from beginners' pottery to advanced sculpture classes.
The Ceramics Program offers scholarships to expand its reach beyond Harvard, including the Peter Berry Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to adults enrollees, and the Ceramics Community Scholarship for Allston-Brighton Residents, which, in partnership with the Harvard Ed Portal, provides aid to adults living in Allston-Brighton.
The studio also hosts workshops and lectures with visiting artists and organizes free exhibits in Gallery 224, its exhibition space. King said these events have resumed following the height of the pandemic.
“We’ve had the door closed for so long because of Covid, so just having an exhibition opening a couple weeks ago — to have the food out, have the drinks, see people who we know live in the neighborhood come in — that was a wonderful feeling to get to see that again,” King said.
Thom Lussier, a resident artist at the studio, described the Ceramics Program as a welcoming atmosphere.
“The very first time I came to the studio, I pulled up to the back door with 47 glazed pots,” Lussier said. “I met Sarah, who's a staff member here, and we immediately connected, and she and Deighton helped me unload my car, and it went straight from my car into a kiln. I had never seen that happen before.”
“I just felt really welcomed. I felt like my work was really cared for — I felt really seen,” he added.
Megumi A. Kirby ’23 first visited the studio for a history class she took in fall 2021. Since then, she has enrolled in a basics class over the summer and a soda firing class this semester.
“I was just finding that while I was at school, because I concentrate in a STEM field, I didn’t have time built into my schedule for creative endeavors,” Kirby said. “After taking the class over the summer, I realized that it was important to me to maintain a schedule with my art.”
Diane Lulek, an instructor at the ceramics studio, said the classes are a great opportunity for students to pursue non-academic interests.
“I think because this is not for academic credit, this is a chance for people to come relax, have fun, and play, and experiment, try something completely new,” Lulek said.
Alexandra C. Kim ’22-’23, a Newton resident, started taking classes at the Ceramics Studio in high school and has stayed involved with the program in college. Kim, who is pursuing a secondary in Art, Film, and Visual Studies, has had her ceramic art featured at numerous local exhibitions and plans to showcase her work in the studio’s gallery this winter.
“Clay, at least in my opinion, is such a fun, workable medium,” she said. “I just wish that more students here knew about [the studio] and were able to enjoy it and have access to it.”

Government Professor Michael J. Sandel discussed the impact of finance-driven globalization on the United States and the world at a panel Tuesday evening.
The event, organized by the Center for American Political Studies, focused on Sandel’s updated edition of his 1996 book titled “Democracy’s Discontent,” which analyzes how bipartisan support for a financialized economy has contributed to today’s political climate. CAPS director Ryan Enos moderated the panel, which included professors Brandon M. Terry ’05, Jennifer L. Hochschild, and Archon Fung.
Sandel discussed how three practices — globalization, financialization, and meritocracy — have affected capitalism and, in turn, democracy.
By regarding these three ideas as necessary, politicians have given too much power to financial institutions, Sandel said.
“Necessity only arose in the first place, because big financial institutions now inserted such a stranglehold on the economy in such outsized political power, that they were too big to fail,” he said.
Sandel said politicians have demonstrated they are willing to trade democratic control of the economy to revive the financial system when it fails, citing the bank bailout of 2008 and Obama’s aid package for Wall Street.
“At such an enormous cost to taxpayers in the economy, [Obama] and his administration put the finance-dominated version of capitalism back together again,” Sandel said.
Actions like these contributed to former President Donald J. Trump’s rise to power, Sandel said.
“After eight years of the Obama administration, 75 percent told pollsters they were looking for a leader who would ‘take the country back from the rich and the powerful at the end of the Democratic administration,’” he said.
Sandel said that in prioritizing meritocracy, politicians in both parties place blame on individuals rather than structural problems in the economy.
“Implicit in the insult was this: if you didn't go to college and if you're struggling in the new economy, your failure must be your fault,” he said. “‘The problem is not with the economic arrangements we devise,’ they said in effect, ‘the problem is that you fail to acquire the credentials necessary for success in a technologically advanced globalized world.”
In response to a question from the audience regarding Trump’s 2020 loss, Sandel said it was surprising the former president was still able to garner so many votes despite his failure to follow through on promises to the working class.
“The real question to answer is, how did he get 74 million votes?” Sandel said. “After bungling the pandemic, not serving the interests of the working-class voters who had voted for him — to say nothing of violating constitutional norms — people stuck with him.”
Still, Sandel attributed Trump’s previous success to the “failure” of liberal politics to defend working class America.
“The success of right wing nativist-populism — of the Donald Trump rise — is generally a symptom of the failure of progressive politics,” Sandel said. “When liberals failed to defend the people against the powerful by holding economic power to democratic account, the people look elsewhere.”
Correction: October 29, 2022: 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Michael Sandel said American politicians have traded civil liberties for economic prosperity. In fact, he said politicians have been willing to sacrifice democratic control of the economy to revive the country’s financial system.

United States Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said the House’s January 6 Select Committee will issue a subpoena to former President Donald J. Trump “shortly,” during remarks at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Tuesday evening.
The Jan. 6 committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony under oath during its final public hearing on Thursday.
“There was no disagreement on the committee,” Cheney said during the IOP forum. “We all felt that our obligation is to seek his testimony, that the American people deserve to hear directly from him, that it has to be under oath, that he has to be held accountable.”
Cheney said she is operating under the assumption that Trump will “fulfill his legal obligation and honor the subpoena.”
“If that doesn’t happen, then we will take the steps we need to take after that,” she added. “But I don’t want to go too far down that path at this point.”
The event, which was moderated by former Wyoming Governor Matthew H. Mead and Hannah A. Bottarel ’24, also covered the future of the Republican Party and the United States’ responsibility to continue supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion.
Cheney said the current internal conflicts among members of the Republican Party are “not about policy disagreements,” but about values.
“The reason that I’m a Republican is because of what the party stands for,” Cheney said. “I happen to believe the most conservative of conservative principles is fidelity to the Constitution.”
“We have to get back to recognizing we all have an obligation to defend the foundations, the Republic,” she added. “That’s what provides the basis for the disagreements about policy.”
With the 2024 presidential election just over two years away, Cheney warned against voters electing Trump to a second term as president.
“I think it’s very important for the survival of the country that Donald Trump not be anywhere close to power again,” Cheney said. “That’s something we need to keep in the forefront as we go forward.”
Cheney drew on examples from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol to argue that individual citizens can play a crucial role in protecting democracy.
“One of the things that I hope the committee has been able to do is make clear that our institutions don’t defend themselves,” she said. “January 6 could have been far worse if people in positions of authority hadn’t stood up.”
Cheney advocated for the American government to continue providing support for Ukraine as it fights against the full-scale invasion Russia launched in February. She also criticized House Minority Leader Kevin O. McCarthy for telling Punchbowl News that American aid for Ukraine might not be approved in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
“I don’t know that I can say I was surprised, but I think it’s really disgraceful that today, Minority Leader McCarthy suggested that if the Republicans get the majority back that we will not continue to provide support for the Ukrainians,” Cheney said.
“Ukraine is the frontline in the battle for freedom, and the world — not just America, but the world — has an obligation to make sure that Ukraine prevails,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Current and former Harvard Kennedy School leaders gathered Tuesday afternoon to dedicate a plaza on the school’s campus in honor of former HKS Dean Graham T. Allison ’62.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, and Chief Executive Officer of Taubman Centers Robert S. Taubman toasted Allison during a private event before participating in a ribbon cutting ceremony to officially unveil the plaza.
Elmendorf, who confessed he grew up a fan of the New York Yankees, compared Allison’s legacy at the Kennedy School to that of baseball slugger Babe Ruth at the old Yankee Stadium.
“The Yankee Stadium of that day was sometimes described as the ‘House that Babe Ruth Built’ because it was Babe Ruth’s incomparable talent that was the foundation on which the Yankees of the 1920s and 30s and subsequent decades was built,” Elmendorf said. “Similarly, I always think of the Kennedy School as the ‘House that Graham Built.’”
When Allison began his tenure as founding dean of the modern Kennedy School in 1977, he did not have the easiest task ahead of him, according to Elmendorf.
“The hard work of turning ideas into reality did not get done by itself,” he said. “All this depended on Graham’s vision and energy, his ability to draw together people — including some who are here with us today — to build this school and to push its mission forward.”
“We are, around the country and around the world, making a profoundly positive difference in many people’s lives — and that would not be the case without you,” Elmendorf said to Allison.
Bacow, who graduated from the Kennedy School with a master’s in public policy in 1976, said that one of the required courses he took as a graduate student at Harvard was taught by two faculty members: “one of whom was a legend, Dick Neustadt, and then there was this other young faculty member — who I think was still a junior faculty member at the time — and that, of course, was Graham, a legend in the making.”
Bacow reflected on advice he gives to students, saying he tells both undergraduate and graduate students that they will have a great experience at school if they can build a lifelong relationship with at least one faculty member.
“I consider myself exceptionally fortunate that Graham falls into that group of faculty members who I’ve been blessed to stay in touch with now — hard to believe, Graham — for a half a century,” Bacow said.
Before concluding his remarks, Bacow said he owed Allison an apology.
“I know that there’s at least one thing that I disappointed you in, so I offer my humble apology,” Bacow said, turning to Allison. “Here it is, 50 years and counting, and I’ve still not learned to fish.”
Bacow raised his glass of champagne: “To the best fisherman in the Kennedy School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just a few days, the banks of the Charles River will be filled with rowers, coaches, and spectators alike for the world’s largest three-day rowing event: the Head of the Charles Regatta.
Since its inception in 1965, this regatta has hosted teams from universities, as well as professional and club squads from across the United States and around the world. It attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators, marking one of the busiest days of the year on Harvard’s campus and in Cambridge. Recruiting thousands of volunteers and sponsored by companies such as Vineyard Vines, Moderna, BNY Mellon Investment Management, and Omni Boston Hotel, many people are attracted to the event not only to watch rowers make history but also to take part in activities such as the Eliot Bridge Enclosure and purchase regatta merchandise and food at the Weld Boathouse. There is also a Reunion Village, where alumni can gather to support their favorite teams.
With early ties to Harvard, the regatta was initially created by members of the Cambridge Boat Club on advice from Harvard sculling instructor Ernest Arlett. Arlett suggested a “Head of the River” contest be held on the Charles River, with “head” referring to races that are generally three miles in length. The course starts at the Boston University Boathouse and runs three miles upstream, ending past Harvard’s campus. Though this three-mile stream of the river is generally packed with sightseers, the hub of spectators tends to crowd around the Harvard bend of the Charles.
Since its inauguration, the event has grown to 55 different events, featuring over 11,000 rowers from all around the world. Winners of each race receive the honorary title, “Head of the Charles.”
Last year, Harvard crew was well-represented in the regatta. One boat from the men’s lightweight team competed in the Men’s Club Fours race, taking fifth place overall. In the same event, a men’s heavyweight team of four claimed first place among 44 boats. Two Radcliffe lightweight teams earned top-five placements in the Women’s Lightweight Eights. One women’s heavyweight boat took home a fifth-place finish in the Club Eights race with a time of 17:02.361. Finally, in the Sunday championship, one team—led by current sophomore Bridget Galloway—took sixth place overall in the Women’s Championship Fours. The team placed behind the victors, Stanford, and a Canadian Olympic boat, as well as Ivy competitors Brown, Yale, and Princeton.
More recently, current and former members from Harvard’s men’s and women’s heavyweight teams competed in the 2022 World Rowing Championships. Four alumni and one current student-athlete, sophomore Jack Dorney, raced in the event, representing four different countries.
Molly Moore ’17 was part of the women’s Para-Rowing Mixed Coxed Four for Team USA, which placed fifth. The U.S. Men’s Eight rostered Pieter Quinton ’20 and Liam Corrigan ’19 and placed fourth in the A Final. Sam Hardy ’18 rowed for Australia, whose boat took home the bronze medal. Dorney occupied the bow seat for Ireland’s men’s fours boat, placing second in the B final.
Alumnus David Ambler ’20 won big for England, racing from the three seat for Great Britain’s coxless four. The boat won both the heat and repechage, advancing to the A final, where it claimed the 2022 World Championship.
For current Harvard rowers, the Head of the Charles marks the opening of both Harvard men’s and women’s crew fall seasons and a chance to pick up from where they left off in the spring.
The women’s heavyweights are coming off a strong season, placing fifth at the Ivy Championships last year. They also notched a pair of third-place finishes, at the Saratoga Invitational and the EAWRC sprints—the annual rowing championship for all of the Ivy League schools—in addition to MIT, Boston University, and Wisconsin, among others.
The women’s lightweights also took third at the EAWRC sprints last season to go along with a fifth-place finish at the IRA Championship in May, a national championship regatta originally founded by Ivy rival Cornell.
The men’s lightweights took home a silver medal at the IRA National Championships this past spring, as the boat of four posted a time of 6:25, just two seconds behind Navy, who won the race in the ML4 Grand Final.
The men’s heavyweights defeated many Ivy schools last year, boasting wins against Cornell, Brown, and Princeton, and taking first place in a race against Penn and Navy. The team also was victorious against Boston neighbor Northeastern University, despite taking sixth place at the IRA National Championships.
Though this famous regatta is not necessarily a testament to the strength of the Harvard crew teams, given the type of competition they are to face during the remainder of their races this fall, it surely is a part of the tradition that graces the Crimson-stained waters of the Charles. It is a step along a much longer journey, one that will once again commence right here at home.
