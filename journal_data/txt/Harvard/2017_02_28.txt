Martin McDonagh’s six-time Tony-nominated play “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” debuted in Boston this month and has already become a must-see show. The minimalist play takes place in a single room with only four characters, yet creates a complicated, captivating world over the course of the show. Apart from a few minor issues in miscommunication between the Irish actors and the American audience, director Garry Hynes produced an absolute masterpiece.
Walking into Emerson/Paramount Theater, which fuses art-deco and neoclassical style, is a theatrical experience in and of itself. Floor-to-ceiling 18th century paintings and gold-plated sculptures mounted atop illuminated columns encompass the audience and erase any trace of the outside world. The contrast of the filthy, cluttered stage and the opulent theater highlights Francis O’Connor’s intricate set design. In many ways, the set reflects the content of the play. Much like the main character's mind, the house is deteriorating. Its incomplete walls barely contain the play, just as Maureen can no longer maintain her sanity.
As with any stereotypical small, quaint town, Leenane holds countless secrets. The inner workings of the characters’ hearts and minds stay secret for years, but, over the course of the play, slowly reveal themselves. The play focuses on the lives of Maureen (Aisling O’Sullivan) and her aging mother, Mag (Marie Mullen). Mullen, who played Maureen in the Broadway run of the play, commands the stage from the moment the stage lights go on until the moment her own lights go out.
The show begins with Mag seated in a rocking chair, from which she can still exert her power over the other characters with ease. The dynamic between Mag and Maureen edges on being both comical and disturbing. Maureen is not only her mother’s 40-year old daughter; she is also her caretaker, sole companion, and only connection to the outside world. Both characters struggle to exert their power over one another in a manner so aggressive that their exchanges seem almost playful. However, the second half of the play reveals that they are more than simply a quarrelsome mother and daughter, and all awkward laughter fades away, leaving only fear and hatred on the stage.
Set against this pair is another family, the Dooley brothers. When Pato Dooley comes home with Maureen after a party, he becomes the sudden voice of reason for the play. His character serves somewhat as comic relief, but he primarily deconstructs the stigma against mental illness, which affects both Mag and Maureen’s lives. Ray Dooley, Pato’s younger brother, is a modern-day Hermes who brings news of the comings and goings of residents of Leenane. His presence is an infrequent reminder that a world outside of Mag’s house exists.
Together, the players create an eerily believable world in which director Hynes constantly pulls apart the concepts of morality, familial love, and sanity. O’Sullivan performs her awkward character as true to life as possible: her body language demonstrates how uncomfortable she feels in her own skin, while her words fight to overcompensate for her insecurities. Meanwhile, Mullen invokes the spirit of a classic crotchety grandmother. Crafting that familiar archetype should evoke sympathy from the audience, but instead brings forth a guilty laughter.
“The Beauty Queen of Leenane,” a play written by an Irish playwright and produced by an Irish theater company, naturally has some difficulty adapting to an American audience. For the first five minutes or so, adjusting to the thick Irish accents detracts from the critical initial moments of characterization. Throughout the play, Irish slang terms may be lost in translation for Bostonian audience members, and consequently the comedic effect gets lost in translation. Jokes about certain foods do not pertain to someone who has never tasted “horrible biscuits” like Kimberleys, Mikados, or Wagon Wheels.
Even though at moments the Irish aspects of the play eclipse its artistry, “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” addresses universally relevant topics. Although McDonagh’s play certainly takes the elderly parent-adult child relationship to the extreme, it prompts necessary reflection on how one should care for aging parents–a question that feels relevant to a millennial generation that will soon face the daunting task of caring for the aging baby boomer population. The play also engages closely with the difficult topic of mental illness in a manner intended to make the audience feel uncomfortable in the best possible way. If the goal of the theater is merely to offer an escape from reality, then “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” failed miserably. However, if the goal of theater is to hold up a mirror to our own reality and accurately reflect both the grotesque and the fantastic elements of it, then “The Beauty Queen of Leenane” masterfully achieved its objective.
“The Beauty Queen of Leenane” is at the Emerson/Paramount Theater from Feb. 8 to 26, 2017.

Although Miles P. Hewitt no longer lives in Pfoho, he still spends many hours in the house’s basement recording studio. After three years studying at Harvard, the English concentrator decided to take a year off to focus on his band, The Solars. Last month, the band toured from Montreal to New York City, and they’re performing in Boston and New York for the next several months, in anticipation of the release of their debut EP "Retitled Remastered." The Solars are performing at Cambridge Queen's Head on March 2.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell me about the history of the band.
Miles P. Hewitt: A long time ago, in Vancouver, Washington, two young dudes, Miles and Quetzel Herzig, became friends in fourth grade, kept in touch, and went to an arts high school together. They played in bands, really terrible high school bands, you know, the usual. And eventually, both ended up in college at Boston: me at Harvard and Quetzel at Berklee. He and I are the nucleus of the band; we do most of the recording together. Quetzel is the technical person, and he’s the percussion mastermind and keyboard. I play the rest of the instruments, bass and guitar and stuff. When we perform, it’s a five[-]piece, but in the studio, it’s mostly just Quetzel and I.
THC: Why did you decide to take a leave of absence this year?
MPH: What led to the gap year was this feeling of destiny. This feeling that this was what I was put on earth to do, to play popular music ... I had been an English concentrator, I studied with a professor whom I really admired, I read a lot. I could just feel … myself becoming a slightly different human being than I had been before, knowing that I could reach for cooler sounds. I knew that now was exactly the time to throw myself into that no mercy and no-looking-back situation. The recording was nine to five, three times a week.
THC: Did you ever want to go to music school?
MPH: I never wanted to make music the center of my academic life. The mysteries in it were worth studying, I felt, but the thought of going to school for music versus studying something like poetry, which was just studying life and thoughts and human soul—that felt a lot more relevant.
THC: But you went to an arts high school? What was that like?
MPH: In hindsight, it was honestly just such incredible bliss that I got to spend four years there [at the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics]. I studied literary arts, which was just poetry, and I played piano in the jazz band. Everyone was playing bands, and there was an imported soda store down the street that we’d all go to after school and just listen to bands. In some ways, it was the most romantic music scene that I had ever been in, and I was only sixteen at the time. It was the coolest thing.
THC: What do you think the biggest difference is between writing your poetry and writing your songs?
MPH: A poem, to me, is a fundamental human art form that anybody can and probably does write. I’m really interested in all these old poems that have been translated. I was on a kick of reading all these ancient Chinese poems from twelve hundred years ago, all these four line poems that are mind-blowing. It seems like somebody yesterday wrote them, just walking down the street and saw a tree and wrote it, but it was actually twelve hundred years ago. Song is a more technical art form to me, though I know some people would disagree. A poem is just something that anybody will dig, if someone is willing to slow down and listen to it. A song, you spend a lot of time on it, it’s a much more technological kind of art form.
THC: Do your poems ever turn into songs?MPH: Super rarely, but occasionally. In the past six months, it’s happened more, probably just with what I’ve been doing with my time off.
THC: Were you involved in the music scene while on campus?
MPH: I mean, yeah. I don’t mean this in a harsh way, but to the extent that there is a music community for what I’m interested in. Everybody’s just focused on other stuff here. It’s not a bad thing, it’s just the size of it here. I think people who want to be involved in music definitely make it a huge part of their lives, but there’s a reason that there’s not a large community of music.
THC: What’s one of your favorite songs?
MH: I really, really think that “Dance Yrself Clean” by LCD Soundsystem is one of the songs of our time, the last ten years. It’s so f**king great. Because it’s really just such a song about being in your late twenties, and all the deception and self-loathing that goes into the really pure [feeling], get-you-by-the-throat-hipster.
THC: Who else do you think is an artist of our time?
MPH: I think Kendrick Lamar is the artist of our time. He’s just so, so surefooted. He doesn’t even have a choice of what he says, it just comes. God or whatever is just whispering straight to his ear, it’s kind of chilling.
THC: Tell me about your EP.
MPH: There’s four tracks on the EP. There’s three that’ve already been released, but this is the real version now. And one of them is kind of new, it was actually one of the first songs that I wrote when I came to Harvard, freshman year. The album is called “Retitled Remastered,” which is kind of ironic because you know, it’s actually our first album, and we’re not really “remastering” it. And also with Kendrick Lamar’s “Untitled Unmastered.” We’re going to be playing at a release party in the Red Room on April 20, and the album comes out the next day.

While the era of garage punk rock may seem over to many, Cloud Nothings would disagree. The Cleveland-based indie rock group has been an exponent of the rock subgenre for the last seven years. In this short time span, the band has come a long way from founder singer-songwriter Dylan Baldi’s lo-fi pop punk musical experiment. Their latest album, “Life without Sound,” features the idiosyncratic loud vocals and fast-paced guitar riffs that fans have come to expect and love. “Life Without Sound” builds upon their last album, a joint project with the pop punk group Wavves on “No Life for Me,” to further refine their distinctive grunge sound, resulting in an enjoyable, albeit sometimes monotonous, experience for those seeking a punk rock group that has stayed true to its roots.
“Life Without Sound” begins with “Up To The Surface,” almost a marching tune, with a slow piano melody preceding a crescendo. Its lyrics present heartache, self-discovery, and solitude as themes central to the album. The use of somber lyrics is not new to the musical group, which has never been afraid of discussing dark emotions in past albums—“How It’s Gonna Go,” a track on “No Life for Me,” features the line “I’m such a fucking mess / Don’t know at all how it’s gonna go”—without turning to self-pity.  “Life Without Sound,” however, suggests a coming-of-age recognition of how one’s expectations of oneself do not always align perfectly with reality: “I thought I knew a way to be / But I’m not right there,” Dylan Baldi sings on the track “Enter Entirely.”
Layered between angry vocals and the thumping of drums is an optimism not found in the band’s previous works. The album ends with the reverbing guitar riffs and screaming vocals of “Realize My Fate,” in which the band rages against the fears exposed throughout the album, claiming to “believe in something bigger.” The album generally follows a theme of an arc from initial self-awareness to a realized purpose—while reminding the audience that this is all easier said than done. This lyrical diversity provides the album with enough momentum to make it through songs that may at times sound repetitive, and the lyrics themselves remain brief yet powerful.
From a technical point of view, Cloud Nothings have managed to further hone their distinctive grunge sound while still conserving some elements from Dylan Bandi’s lo-fi style. Guitar reverbs are periodically ring throughout the album. At 37 minutes with nine tracks, six out of the nine songs have a running time of almost four minutes or more, but those 37 minutes are gone in a flash. The best song on the album, “Enter Entirely,” brings together all of the band’s strengths, serving as a midpoint anchor that brings cohesion to the album. The incorporation of the touring guitarist Chris Brown in 2016—replacing previous guitarist Joe Boyer who left in 2013—is a welcome addition.
All in all, “Life Without Sound” can be either listened to as a head-banging anthem or as a reflexive meditation on the 25-year-old lead singer songwriter Dylan Baldi’s foray into young adulthood. The beauty of “Life Without Sound” is the versatility of tracks that get better and better after each listen. Though it may seem initially difficult to enjoy for some, “Life Without Sound” promises 37 minutes of fierce music. It may not bring anything new to the genre, but it is certainly a welcome addition. If anything, the album proves that the time-tested punk rock genre is alive and well—and intends to stick around.

The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra delivered an impressive concert on Saturday. The program included Richard Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Höllander,” John Adams’ “Saxophone Concerto,” and Alberto Ginastera’s “Four Dances” from “Estancia.” The great variation offered by each piece made for an exciting listening experience, sampling music from three different centuries. Every moment of this wonderful concert was engaging.
Cellist and assistant conductor Sasha G. Scolnik-Brower ’17 conducted the opening piece, the overture to “Der Fliegende Höllander.” Intense from the start, “The Flying Dutchman” began with the bold main theme structured in the horns and low brass and given substance by the running strings beneath. This powerful melody was restated throughout the overture, which finally culminated in an unexpectedly soft finale. Though “Der Fliegende Höllander” did not quite achieve the level of precision of the ensuing pieces, the performance was well-executed nonetheless.
For the orchestra’s next selection, conductor Federico Cortese took over the baton to deliver the Boston-area premiere of Adams’ “Saxophone Concerto.” The featured saxophonist, Jake Tilton ’19, gave a performance that was awe-inspiring in musicality and endurance. The orchestra and saxophonist worked together like a well-written novel: While Tilton provided the plot, the orchestra determined its setting. The result was an otherworldly cacophony with a strong jazz influence that navigated changing keys and tempos and especially complex rhythms. The complexity of the Adams piece was in pleasing contrast to the strings, which provided the only percussion with their pizzicato sections. Although the orchestra and saxophonist played beautifully, it was the crisp, pregnant silences that really made this piece successful. Following the conclusion of the concerto, Cortese expressed his pleasure at Tilton’s astonishing performance. Audience members were equally impressed, giving Tilton and the orchestra a long standing ovation.
HRO concluded their concert with “Four Dances” from Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera’s “Estancia.” For this selection, the percussion section was back in full force. The unity of the mallets and zealous tambourine technique stood out in particular, adding to the dance-like feel of the piece. From “Los trabajadores agricolas,” the opening theme, to the slow movement “Danza del trigo,” which featured beautifully executed flute and violin solos, the orchestra showcased their versatility. The third dance, “Los peones de hacienda,” brought back the initial theme, then built into the clamorous finale, “Danza final,” whose simultaneous strain and excitement brought a thrilling suite to a breathless conclusion. In fact, “Four Dances” seemed to be a literal dance for Cortese, who definitely got in an aerobic workout with the musically and physically demanding “Danza final.”
After the final cut off, audience members again stood in applause for HRO’s commendable performance. The diversity and enthusiasm of each piece made the evening a true pleasure.

“For fifteen. For eighteen. For nineteen, twenty-two.” These numbers span the ages of the women Morgan Parker speaks to in her latest work. Morgan Parker’s self-reflective poetry collection “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” is the anthem of a young black woman coping with the challenges of growing up. The book moves from poems entitled “We Don’t Know When We Were Opened (Or, The Origin of the Universe)” to “Beyonce Prepares a Will” and its penultimate entry, “Funeral for The Black Dog.” Parker uses the cryptic names of her poems to structure her book around the passing of time, consistent with the anxiety of growing old that she expresses throughout. Recipient of the 2017 National Endowment of the Arts Literature Fellowship and the 2016 Pushcart Prize, Morgan Parker delivers once again with this newest book, a daring look at what it is like to come of age in America.
Despite her book’s raw intimacy, Parker still creates a subtle distinction between writer and speaker in each poem. While her poems are emotional and her speaker unsure of who she is, Parker demonstrates a deep knowledge of literary and popular culture, an impressive command of her art form, and a sharp wit. She seamlessly stitches together allusions to T. S. Eliot, classic film, and modern music, portraying a speaker who struggles to find her place in the world. Parker even structures one of her poems, “The Book of Negroes,” after the jazz classic “Summertime,” paying tribute to a genre invented by African-Americans. By changing the song’s original lyrics, Parker cleverly and ironically calls attention to the appropriation of black culture that her speaker experiences daily.
“There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé” is saturated with commentary that shows its awareness of social issues and their effect on youth. The speaker worries about body image and fashion, struggles to discern which flaws are acceptable, and manages her poor mental health. She angrily identifies in herself “a quiet, calculated shame,” the result of the institutions around her. In “99 Problems,” Parker compiles a wide-ranging list of issues, identifying the complex problems of the prison system, misogyny, the institution of marriage, and a woman’s right to say “no” as well as smaller concerns like hangovers and dating. By interspersing both societal and personal problems in her list, Parker validates small worries. She asserts that no matter how inconsequential our struggles may seem to the world, if they affect us, they are valid.
In “There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé,” Parker fearlessly examines the things that society takes for granted. The sky, which is “so overused because no one’s sure of it,” is included in her list of things more beautiful than Beyoncé. Parker also subverts societal expectations with cliché twists that force readers to reevaluate their own assumptions. The speaker makes her bed and has sex in it, too; she kisses herself hello.
Parker achieves a similar aim with her surprising use of enjambment. By separating a single idea into two separate lines, Parker creates phrases that, read in isolation, have dramatically different meanings. This results in concurrent double meanings that add complexity to otherwise simple sentences. For example, the poem "Beyoncé in Third Person" contains the line "We all got high," conveying the speaker's need for escape. However, the following line "levels of entitlement in our veins" allows a whole new interpretation of Parker's words and adds a subtle metaphor about the drug-like effect of our entitlement. In using this technique, Parker expresses the concern that people like the speaker, taken out of the context of their background, or judged without considering their entire story, will also be misread.
Morgan Parker’s latest release is a book of intimate poems that are simultaneously deeply personal and attentive to broadly relevant issues. Race, gender, sexuality, and religion are just a few of the topics Morgan Parker tackles in her ambitious collection. Her frank, relatable evaluation of 21st-century women is both a critique of society and a hope-filled wish for a better future. Queen Bey is on a level we all aspire to reach, but she is not the pinnacle. Parker’s bid for individuality empowers readers by validating their messy, unglamorous lives and imbuing them with the with the knowledge that there are better things than Beyoncé.

The New England Conservatory’s main concert hall may seem a strange venue for a Southern rock-indie-jazz band like Lake Street Dive. The ornate decorations and velvet seats juxtaposed with drummer Mike Calabrese’s bare feet and trumpeter and guitarist Mike Olson’s striking purple sneakers and psychedelic-patterned suit. That being said, Lake Street Dive is no ordinary rock band, and their performance was no ordinary rock concert: The four alumni of the New England Conservatory made use of the lavish New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall beautifully by fusing old and new—and jazz and rock—for a memorable experience.
With the concert’s debut of deafening trumpets in the hall’s aisles, the gospel choir that greeted the audience with a piece written for the concert, and the big jazz band that joined Lake Street Dive, the musical group that refuses to limit itself to a single clear-cut genre gave an amazing performance. On Thursday night, the band members were first and foremost distinguished alumni of the New England Conservatory here to make their triumphant return and to pay their respects to an institution celebrating its 150th anniversary.
Lake Street Dive was also there to present its new album “Side Pony,” which the band has described as representing their whimsical and free-spirited identity. Bathed in purple, blue, and red neon lights, Lake Street Dive demonstrated their technical skills incorporating trumpet, guitar, and double bass solos into nearly all of the songs from “Side Pony” and their previous sophomore album, “Bad Self Portraits.” The result was selected tracks from two already solid albums that sounded even better in person.
While Lake Street Dive was effective when playing by themselves, it was excellent when complemented by the gospel choir. The first song of the concert was an affirmation of the band’s ability to cross genres with ease. A custom-written piece, the rendition was a welcome addition to the concert. Jordan Hall, considered to be one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in the United States and second in Boston only to Symphony Hall, was an ideal venue to premiere the composition.
When NEC’s Jazz Ensemble joined them onstage, Lake Street Dive was able to preserve their distinctive rock feel without ever drowning out the other musicians.The jazz band added layers of musical complexity that enriched the original songs, especially the inclusion of saxophones and the adaptation of music originally composed for the double bass to accommodate a violin section amplified the experience’s intensity. The joint ensemble also covered memorable jazz songs, allowing members to show off the talents they honed at the New England Conservatory. Lead singer Rachael Price showcased her formidable vocal skills, that would have otherwise gone unnoticed in the band’s own albums, by joining the ensemble for a rendition of “God Bless the Child” and “Angel Eyes.”
In between songs and set changes, the band members talked about how they all came to be friends, sharing comedic anecdotes of contracting mononucleosis at an elderly home over the summer, acting as tumbleweeds at an improv class, and falling prey to poor fashion choices. Their charisma kept dull moments from a minimum. Their upbeat personalities made for music that made you want to clap and sing along—which they encouraged—even in century-old ostentatious Jordan Hall. It made for a congenial night, with standing ovations and a brief encore.

Lupe Fiasco has had what may be the most tumultuous career in rap. In 2005, when he was famously “discovered” by Kanye West on “Touch the Sky” and released his “Fahrenheit 1/15” series, Fiasco was considered one of rap’s most exciting young stars and praised for his lyrics, storytelling, and message. But his self-importance, controversial statements, retirements, and (justified) struggles with Atlantic Records began to unravel his career, as Atlantic stopped pushing his records and his quality declined. Although he had a critical resurgence with 2015’s “Tetsuo & Youth,” the album was a commercial failure. The buzz generated in 2016 when Fiasco announced three new albums quickly faded after he made anti-Semitic remarks on “N.E.R.D.” and then defended his comments in an even worse way. Now he has decided he will retire from music again after releasing his trilogy.
“DROGAS Light,” the first album of the trilogy, is Fiasco’s first album free from Atlantic-imposed constraints and features a variety of leftovers from his previous albums as well as a few new songs. The “Light” in the title distinguishes this album from the next in the trilogy, “DROGAS,” and Fiasco himself seems to consider the album less than perfect. The tracks range from pop to trap to conscious hip-hop in subgenre, but the musical diversity is poorly integrated and just sounds unfocused. The production hurts the album too. On “Dopamine Lit (Intro),” the beat is abrasive with few redeeming qualities, and it sounds like a rubber band being snapped for two and a half minutes straight. “Jump” has a similar problem: It features a single vocal effect for four and a half minutes. In fact, “Jump” may have the weakest concept of any song Fiasco has ever made, describing a meeting between himself and a trapper who wants to become a famous rap star and wants Fiasco to write her hit songs, but then they get involved in a shootout, escape and are somehow transported to space, where the trapper wants to stay—but Fiasco wants to go home. Words can barely describe the idiocy of the song. Other songs on this album have bad concepts, like “It’s Not Design,” which randomly transitions to a verse about the future that’s as weak and repetitive as it is meaningless, but none of them reach the depths of “Jump.”
For an album largely of outtakes, the flow is pretty much what you’d expect, as none of the songs feel like they belong together. The trap songs don’t mesh with the pop nearly as well as Lupe might have hoped, and the flow only picks up towards the middle of the album, when most of the songs are so boring that it’s hard to care anymore. Transitions like those between the abrasive “Dopamine Lit (Intro)” and more relaxed “NGL” or between the poignant “Pick Up the Phone” and the base-heavy “It’s Not Design,” especially grate. Fiasco pitched this album as a refined version of “Lasers,” but somehow “DROGAS Light” is even more inconsistent. Between the choppy transitions and the fact that the album increasingly sounds like a collection of standalone songs, most of which aren’t good, “DROGAS Light” somehow is worse than the previously most reviled Lupe Fiasco album of all time.
With all this said, the album has its moments. “Tranquillo” features Fiasco sticking to the conscious rap he knows best, despite getting “renegaded” by Big K.R.I.T. The lead single “Pick Up the Phone” is almost a pop ballad, but Lupe pulls it off with quality verses and a beat that oscillates between sounding like synths and an acoustic guitar. The problem is that in an album that’s mostly outtakes, everything feels a little like filler.
“DROGAS Light” suffers from bad production, too much filler, and poor incorporation. All of this serves to make the album a frustrating listen. While there are good moments in the album, there is nothing nearly redeeming enough to justify wasting an hour on it. This is an album from one of rap’s formerly rising stars that will be utterly forgotten within the year, and it leaves little confidence that the rest of his trilogy will be good. “DROGAS Light” puts the final nail in the coffin of Lupe Fiasco’s relevance.

On the 1976 album “Super Ape” from reggae pioneer Lee “Scratch” Perry and his band The Upsetters, a refrain emerges from a punchy drum intro amid creeping rhythms and haunting back-up vocals: “Zion blood is flowing through my veins so I and I will never work in vain.” It’s the lo-fi sound of the primordial soup, and echoing from it is an expression of social solidarity between “I and I” (a Jamaican Patois term for “we”).
Flash-forward four decades to 2017. The Washington D.C.-based DJ collective Thievery Corporation release their new album “The Temple of I and I,” inspired by the legacy of dub music and reggae. The sound of the lead track “Thief Rockers” is pristine hi-fi, the rhythms are distinctly Jamaican but sanitized, unlike The Upsetters’ thick, rumbling percussion, and everything is smothered with a generous helping of ambient house synth. While there’s nothing wrong with a new take on an old sound, Thievery Corporation come back for their tenth studio album with an over-produced pastiche of Jamaican sound, empty of the richness of analog recording that marked their predecessors in this genre. This, unfortunately, has become par for the course with the group, which has been taking the diverse genres of world music and mixing them down to the lowest common denominator of trip-hop, chill-out, and electronica for over two decades. While trip-hop and turntablism gave the world arguably the most original musical work of the 1990’s—DJ Shadow’s “Endtroducing…..” (1996)—the cultural sampling of Thievery Corporation is about as tasteful as the cultural collage plastered over the cover of the “Temple of I and I.”
The politics come through just as flat as the music. Remarks like “bring fire to Illuminati” on “Thief Rockers” play into the vaguely paranoid agenda that has always marked the group which produced albums like “The Mirror Conspiracy” (2000), “Radio Retaliation” (2008), and “Culture of Fear” (2011). The tracks “Letter to the Editor,” “Weapons of Distraction,” “Fight to Survive” and “Drop Your Guns” are particularly unambiguous. If the idea of the “Temple of I and I” is meant to be a point of solidarity against the Man, the Illuminati, or whatever the fashionable term for institutional power is these days, the tepid result is more corporate than ever.
This return to business as usual for the group in part came as a slight surprise after their poignant 2014 album “Saudade,” a revival of Brazilian bossa nova music in the tradition of João Gilberto, Antônio Carlos Jobim, and Sergio Mendes. Still the most tightly focused Thievery Corporation album to date, narrowing in on one particular musical tradition and taking a more understated approach to the synths, which flowed more naturally over the crisp guitars, saw the group finding a happy medium between the old guard and the new of easy listening music (“Depth of my Soul” was begging to be the theme song for a Bond movie). This becoming change was unfortunately ditched on “The Temple of I and I.” In fact, the album’s most interesting track, “Time + Space,” with its repetitive guitar reminiscent of The xx’s “Crystalised” and elements of big beat production that feel like the closing song to a ‘90s action movie, owes much of its substance to the presence of multilingual “Saudade” collaborator Loulou Ghelichkhani. Despite the new album’s region-specific focus, old habits die hard, and the Jamaican sound finds itself playing second fiddle to the early ‘00s ambient house instead of the other way around. With a budding generation of music listeners being molded by Spotify’s premade playlists for every possible mood, in many ways now is the perfect time for a new set of electronica artists and classic albums. “The Temple of I and I” will not number among them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Like many overzealous Frank Ocean fans, I was a bit ruffled when I heard that the artist was teaming up with Calvin Harris and Migos for a single. The news felt like hearing your capital-A Artsy friend tell you that they just landed a job writing for the Arts section of the Wall Street Journal—your knee-jerk response, knowing their maverick values, is to tell them to get as far, far away as they can. So I wondered: What peculiar misery could acquaint the man who protested the Grammy Awards in his self-described “Kaepernick moment” with such strange, commercial bedfellows?
As I listen to “Slide” more and more, I am starting to think that the key to unlocking the mystery might be in a lesser-known cut from Ocean’s discography: “U-N-I-T-Y” from the visual album “Endless.” The song doubles as a showcase of Ocean’s quick-witted lyricism (catch it in the line “Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up,” where Ocean relies on imagery to analogize the artificiality of plastic surgery to startup culture) and a nod to the pared-down, woozy instrumentals that Tyler, The Creator might have cooked up during the heyday of Odd Future. On “U-N-I-T-Y,” Ocean rhymes about drawing contact with artists who are “tryna go pop” and dares them to “rip [his] facemask.” Pop, to the extent that the word is more than just a blanket term for what is trending, might be Ocean’s facemask: a pliable costume Ocean wears in order to evert the familiar.
“Slide” contains the essential ingredients of a pop confection. Its title, a slang term for sex without strings attached, speaks to the currency of our contemporary homosocial bragging economy: “How many girls slide in your DMs, bro?” Its sun-soaked production, anchored by EDM favorite Calvin Harris, lies somewhere between the slinky revivalist funk of Bruno Mars and the throbbing house music Harris is known for. Quavo and Offset, two-thirds of your local fraternity’s favorite hip hop trio, trumpet diamond-adorned masculine fantasia: dabbing, making millions, smoking, and having sex with women attractive enough to be on “The Bachelor.” Frank Ocean, a name no fan of music can ignore, emerges from the emotional mist of piano that kicks off the song, chirping a tired trope about emptying his bank account.
At least, it sure seems he is. Not long after the single’s release, Ocean strayed from his quiet public persona to shed light on the meaning of his pitch-shifted lyrics. Apparently, they do refer to emptying Ocean’s bank account, but only to purchase a work of art: Pablo Picasso’s “Garçon à la pipe.” No need to project a critic’s stuffy interpretation about how Ocean is emphasizing the material value of art in the age of streaming; I am of the belief that Ocean embarked on this project because he wanted to let some air in, and he certainly deserves to after “Blond(e).” There is, however, a compelling yin-yang relationship between Ocean’s delivery and verse and Quavo’s and Offset’s verses. As the latter two swear by the glimmer of their diamonds, Ocean uses his jewelry to document a relationship marked by physical proximity but emotional distance (“Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah / Laying, we’re still a link apart”). Throughout the song, Ocean’s voice frays into a deadpan, suggesting a fatigue that becomes visible when one “put[s] some spotlight on the slide.” Ocean’s ambivalence elevates what would otherwise be a safe summer jam to the status of a timely cultural artifact: He holds up a mirror to the feeling of waking up in an exceptionally warm late February and wanting to bask in the sun but being too weighed down by the erosion of sustainable climatic conditions and a heedless administration to truly rest. The song’s most defiant line (“If we could see in twenty twin / Twice we could see it ’til the end”) weds the personal and the political, as Ocean could be expressing a desire for emotional clarity (20/20) in a bejeweled relationship or for survival in the Trump era (can we hold our breath until 2020?).
Such is the multicolored, breezy beauty of “Slide”—not that it skewers the life of excess that big pop panders to, but that it refuses a one-dimensional attitude toward it. It preserves both the luster and the languor of a lavish, lascivious life, and—when it sounds this good—why not slide through?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While feature film nominees such as  “La La Land” and “Moonlight” played the leading roles in Monday evening’s Academy Awards ceremony, the contenders in the short film categories (live action and animated films) did not gain as much attention. Nevertheless, many of these works show as much genius and innovation as any other competitors.

Borrowed Time
dir. Andrew Coats, Lou Hamou-Lhadj (Quorum Films)—4 Stars
“Borrowed Time” explores the concept of irreparable damage as a sheriff returns to the scene of a crime that he inadvertently caused many years before. The film cycles between the past and the present and shows the relationship between the sheriff and his predecessor, a close friend who was also involved in the incident. The brilliance of the short lies in its attention to detail, such as a timepiece that the protagonist broke and lost in the accident and discovers during his guilt trip.  When he opens the watch, the memento reveals a picture of him and the ex-sheriff together.
Despite the film’s emotional poignancy, its power is undermined by choppy narratives. Half of the film is snippets from the past, but the transitions between flashbacks and the present feel poorly executed at times, with the chief offender a step away from the truth when the camera abruptly cuts back to a random carriage chase in the past. The action sequence turns out to be unimportant, and the time could’ve been used to further develop the relationship between the protagonist and ex-sheriff. Altogether, “Borrowed Time” is an intriguing story that seems to need a bit more time.

Pearl
dir. Patrick Osborne (Evil Eye Pictures)—5 Stars
As the first virtual reality film ever to be nominated for an Oscar, “Pearl” set expectations high and followed through. It tells the story of a father, a daughter, and their music all from the perspective of a car. The plot is fairly simple: the father and daughter travel around, playing music for money, and the daughter eventually grows up and goes through life with her own band. The film is a “360 Google Spotlight Story,” meaning the viewer can look around the car throughout the short.
What’s clever about “Pearl” is that it tells a traditional parent-child story, but with barely any dialogue. On the rare occasions when people speak, their voices are somewhat obscured by the song that plays throughout. Every shot is beautifully executed, and the images speak for themselves. For instance, after the dad watches in silence a happy family living a stable life, in the next shot the audience sees that he has bought a house for his daughter. This six-minute short is a must-watch.

Ennemis interieurs (Enemies Within) 
dir. Sélim Azzazi (Qualia Films)—4.5 Stars
The central topic in “Ennemis interieurs” is immigration, one of the most important issues in the world today. The short follows an Algerian man in the 90s applying for citizenship in France, a nation in which he’s lived his whole life. The man, who has a criminal record and is Muslim, is subjected to aggressive questioning about meetings he had with other Muslims and is denied citizenship unless he gives their names. The film demonstrates the ways in which aggression and racism distort the interactions between the protagonist and the immigration officer. For instance, when the protagonist describes the meetings, he sees them as warm and friendly, but in the imagination of the immigration officer, they are potentially threatening to national security. It’s unclear whether the officer is actually racist or merely enabling a system of racial prejudice. The film grows progressively more devastating as it continues, until the protagonist is thoroughly drained.
The short’s biggest weakness is that aspects of the storyline are jumbled. For example, the descriptions of the meetings are very vague, and the visuals representations make them look more cultish than the director likely wanted. However, the conclusion of the film draws every moment together in a heart-wrenching way.

Timecode 
dir. Juanjo Giménez Peña—4 Stars
“Timecode” is the most lighthearted of the bunch: It follows a developing romance between two security guards, one night shift and one day shift, from the perspective of the latter. Much of the story is told through surveillance cameras and notes, as the two begin dancing with each other over the security footage. The short cleverly shows this romance with few words and demonstrates the protagonist’s progression as she learns to dance. She first dances in a laughably restrained way, but by the end she has become an expert. However, the ending of the short, in which a new security guard and the boss come in and view the footage, feels like a half-hearted out constructed by writers who didn’t know how to end the movie.

“The Woman Next Door,” Yewande Omotoso’s first novel published in the United States, features a fair dose of catty old women. Two widowed next-door neighbors in a South African suburb face their past while firing insults at one another. Though it initially reads more like a beach book than a serious piece of literature, the novel’s discussion of difficult topics such as racism, apartheid, grief, and the past add a depth that a lesser novel would lack.
The two protagonists—a white woman and black woman, both well into their eighties—offer a refreshing change of pace. While many novels make the mistake of rarely including elderly characters, Omotoso brings dimension to her characters. It is easy to feel conflicted: both women are problematic in their own ways, but only because they have endured hardships in their life. Marion, the white woman, both ignores the injustices of the world and in many ways contributes to them, in order to cope with the horrors in South Africa’s history that she never stood up against. Hortensia, the black woman, is purposefully vindictive and enjoys the pain of others. Initially, both women seem to fit the mold for the grumpy old woman, but Omotoso paints backstories for both women that make them more complex.
It is this complexity that makes “The Woman Next Door” so interesting. Throughout the novel the reader does not know whether to love or hate Marion and Hortensia. Both Marion and Hortensia alternately narrate the story to provide a glimpse into the pasts of the two protagonists. Some moments shine with sentiments of friendship, while others seep with hatred. At one point Hortensia snaps at Marion and declares, “At no point in anything are you and I on the same side. I don’t side with hypocrites.” Arguments between the two women and the dual narration also reveal that both Marion and Hortensia seem to truly wish each other harm. However, flashbacks give powerful insight as to what exactly made these women who they are in their old age. Even on the final page of the novel, an uncertainty about the characters’ decency remains. Omotoso uses this as a strategy to force her readers to think about who people are at the ends of their lives and whether or not their past can excuse their present actions.
Omotoso does an excellent job incorporating humor into her novel even in the darkest of times. A short quip from one of the women interrupts moments of tension, giving a laugh in the most stressful situations. This allows the book to maintain the levity its synopsis misleadingly promises while still dealing with the difficult subjects that plague the characters.
Paradoxically, the book is both fundamentally about race and barely touches on the issue. Omotoso rarely has her characters openly address racism, yet the characters’ actions still manage to create racist undertones. Marion struggles with her own racist thoughts, while Hortensia calls out those around her for being racist as a means to make them uncomfortable. While a few moments in the novel directly deal with Marion’s racism, many relationships are used to subtly highlight race relations. The treatment of Agnes, Marion’s housekeeper, and the interracial marriage between Hortensia and her white husband allow the reader to understand the social climate of South Africa. This book is only lightly peppered with direct mentions of the racial injustice of apartheid and the present-day effects of the historical tragedy, yet this is the very essence of the novel as it shows how invisibly pervasive racism is.
The ending of this novel, while satisfying, leaves much to the reader. It is unclear how Omotoso intends for her main characters to come across: should their behavior be excused, or is there no forgiving it? As the two women look back on their lives and decide whether or not they have lived correctly, the reader will be left wondering the same. Through the bittersweet tales of two old women, Yewande Omotoso manages to deliver a thought-provoking novel about apartheid and race relations in South Africa—and an enjoyable read as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On June 12, 1967, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Loving family in a case that had taken years to resolve. Richard Loving, a white man, and his wife Mildred, a black woman, had been in exile from their home state of Virginia after being arrested and imprisoned under the state’s law against miscegenation (interracial marriage). On that day, “love won” and the Lovings walked away a lawfully wedded couple.
On June 12, 1993, 26 years later to the day, my parents, Jill and Paul Whittaker, walked out of St. Jude’s Church a lawfully wedded couple. My mother was born and raised outside of Washington D.C., to an Italian father and Irish-German mother. My father was born in Jamaica, the descendant of former slaves. They love each other very much.
And now, another 26 years later, dancing to the thrum of synthetic bass and backlit by rainbow discos, I look at the white boy who’s looking back at me from across the room. I wonder what to do. And I feel guilty.
From my childhood, I was trained to whitewash my happily ever after. It’s no wonder that the man I dreamed of was always brunette or blonde, not when films, books, and art all fed me an image of beauty that ran the spectrum from Al Pacino in “The Godfather” (somewhat white) to Matthew Macfayden in “Pride and Prejudice” (VERY white). I was led to believe that the only romantic future possible lay in white bodies.
This isn’t an isolated phenomenon. Cultural imperialism is the idea that society “tak[es] the culture of the ruling class and establish[es] it as the norm.” In other words, we live in a white supremacist world, where power and capital is disproportionately concentrated in the hands of white communities and individuals. This power and capital then moves beyond the material; our society’s norms―how we define everything, including beauty―are all white-centric. To be white is to be beautiful. And thus to be not white―to be black―is to be ugly.
The danger of white beauty standards is not just that white people and the culture at large see black people as undesirable. Black people are so socialized, so caught in the trap of cultural imperialism, that we ourselves become convinced that they’re right. Bleaching one’s own skin (which is a world-wide epidemic) is only the extreme. We become convinced that white people truly are beautiful, and we are not. By being taught to hate ourselves, we learn to hate others who look like us.
Love, then, is political and powerful. What we as the devalued do matters. Too often, the black community abandons itself, refusing to acknowledge its own beauty, seeking for love elsewhere. Too often, we buy into the lies, and suffer for it. At its core, black love for black bodies is a defense mechanism, a survival tactic; for a black body to love another black body is to love oneself. Black love is beautiful because it is a rejection of the lies. It embraces our glory as living, breathing beings that are worth loving.
All this is well and good. But I am a light-skinned black man with a white mother. And that brings with it a whole host of complications.
I believe that I have a responsibility to validate blackness and its beauty. And yet I struggle to detach myself from the lies this culture teaches us. I know that an attraction to white bodies is the result of centuries of devaluation of black bodies. But, as guilty and ashamed as it makes me, I know that brainwashing of that scale and strength cannot be thrown off easily. As a light-skinned black man specifically, I benefit from centuries of exotification and fetishization of light-skinned people of color. I may be black, but I’m not too black. I can have a seat at the master’s table, if I want. I get to choose; too many black people, too many other black queer men don’t get that choice. Colorism is real; it’s the same fiction that tied Uncle Toms to their masters. At the end of the day, we all want to belong to that which excludes us. So when I am given that opportunity, it takes work to shrug it off.
And all the while, I’m thinking of my parents. 53 years ago, I could only have been a dream, because 53 years ago the state would have been fully within its rights to arrest my parents for loving each other. My parents have never had it easy. The world has worked against them since they first fell in love. I could never judge them. As much as I wish to trust only black love, I cannot deny the meaning of my parents’ struggle. To ignore them ―is to ignore reality. Nor can I separate myself from that part of who I am. I am a product of struggle, in more ways than one. I am a product of my black ancestors’ struggle to love themselves and each other. But I am also the product of my parents’ struggle to be with each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent spate of thefts in student dorms has triggered the creation of a new College subcommittee within the Harvard Security Committee to explore options for how to curtail the uptick in stolen laptops and other valuables. We have sympathy for the students whose expensive, often hard-to-replace items were taken from their dorms, and understand that these thefts violate students’ sense of security and privacy. However, we believe that the responsibility to better protect valuables falls on the student body rather than the administration.
Many of the recent thefts from student dorms have occurred primarily as a result of lax attitudes towards securing rooms. Students do not take the appropriate precautions to prevent strangers from entering dorms and often leave their rooms unlocked even when their valuables are inside. Stopping these thefts is thus relatively easy. If students simply lock their doors as advised by the College, the problem will likely dissipate.
While we support increased security measures such as installing security cameras, as we previously opined, we believe that the ultimate responsibility to secure personal items lies with each student. For many students, college is the first time that they are living independently. We hope that one of the main takeaways from these thefts is that locking your door is a basic part of residing in your own apartment or home.
We also question the College’s decision to create a new subcommittee to further examine this issue. Historically, committees have been shown to be inefficient at quickly and smoothly solving problems. It is improbable that this new subcommittee will result in action and likely that it will add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. However, we do understand that Harvard undergraduates and the College may wish to seek out a sense of closure by solving the thefts, and that this subcommittee has been created with the best of intentions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 23, 2017 at 2:18 p.m.
To much fanfare, University President Drew G. Faust announced last December that Harvard had reduced campus greenhouse gas emissions by 30% since 2006. President Faust also announced a Climate Change Task Force, showcased the initiatives Harvard offers on climate, and asserted that "Harvard must continue to drive progress related to climate change—sharing what is known, expanding what is known, and acting on what is known."
Harvard's progress on reducing campus emissions is laudable, yet climate change is a problem of both supply and demand. The University is addressing its demand for fossil fuels, but what about its involvement in supply? Here is "what is known" about supply if we are to meet the now-ratified Paris Agreement on climate:
First, investments into fossil fuel extraction need to be reduced by about $100 billion per year for at least the next decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And total investments in fossil fuel supply need to be reduced by $5 trillion by 2035, according to the International Energy Agency.
Second, new fossil-fueled power plants without carbon capture and storage (which is not widely available) should no longer be built after this year, according to the International Energy Agency and peer-reviewed scientific literature.
Finally, new fossil fuel extraction and transportation infrastructure (such as pipelines) should no longer be built starting this year, according to a recent report by Oil Change International.
In short, meeting the Paris Agreement on climate requires changes in investments. For Harvard, this means making a climate-friendly investment policy that phases out investments in fossil fuel production and infrastructure.
As it stands today, Harvard continues to hold significant investments in fossil fuels: in part of 2014, it put a full one-third of its direct investments (the 3% snapshot of the endowment we can see) into the fossil fuel sector, and in 2016, it was an anchor investor in an oil and gas fund. President Faust can change this, bringing Harvard into alignment with the Paris Agreement. Such a change would demonstrate that Harvard's climate goals are truly science-based and not just for show.
How important are Harvard's investments in relation to climate change? According to the Harvard Public Affairs & Communications office, the University's recent announcement corresponds to a reduction in campus emissions of about 85,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. In comparison, Harvard's investments are estimated to have a 100 million ton carbon dioxide footprint. So in terms of carbon emissions, the University's investments are much more important than its campus emissions.
These numbers show that either the Harvard Corporation has a scientific blind spot regarding the importance of investments in climate change, or that it is treating climate change as a public relations issue rather than the era-defining threat that it is. Neither would live up to Harvard’s standards of excellence.
The good news is that we can do better. Currently, more than 600 institutions around the globe with more than $5 trillion in assets have made policies to move their investments away from fossil fuels. It is fully within Harvard's power to do this too.
Comparing Harvard's investment carbon footprint with its campus carbon footprint also demonstrates that divesting from fossil fuels is far from merely symbolic. Indeed, if we accept the importance of reducing our emissions, then we must also accept responsibility for our investments. After all, Harvard's investment carbon footprint is much, much larger than its campus carbon footprint.
President Faust has spoken out against adopting a climate-friendly investment policy, saying, "The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change." The definitions of these words can be debated for as long as we’d like, but the simple fact will remain: We need to reduce our investments in fossil fuels to address climate change. That includes everyone, including Harvard.
Harvard's campus, buildings, and endowment are all resources. The University rightfully reduces its emissions and uses its buildings for climate research—and it should also use its endowment responsibly by making a climate-friendly investment policy. It is one of the most important actions Harvard can take, with even greater impact than reducing campus emissions. Harvard's Climate Change Task Force should recommend a climate-friendly investment policy, and the president should adopt it. At that point, President Faust can truly say Harvard is "acting on what is known"—and not just on what may be convenient to hear.

He is currently doing a second Ph.D. in History of Science at Stanford University, focusing on climate politics.
CLARIFICATION: March 23, 2017
A previous version of this article implied that Harvard's carbon emissions could be precisely compared to its investment footprint. To clarify, carbon emissions are measured yearly while a carbon investment footprint is a set amount.

The Cambridge Fire and Police Departments responded to a structure fire Monday morning on the Winthrop House construction site.
The fire began around 9:15 a.m. when heat from the construction crew’s welding materials ignited the wall insulation, according to an emailed statement from University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga. The fire occurred in upper floors of the House  and spread to the roof and walls. Five engines, three ladders, two squads, and two division chiefs were on site responding to the fire, according to tweets by the Cambridge Fire Department.
At 11:36 a.m., the Cambridge Police Department, apart from one detail officer, departed from the scene and handed command over to the Harvard University Police Department. No injuries have been reported.
“All of the contractors on-scene were safely evacuated and accounted for,” wrote Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick in an emailed statement.
Since late May 2016, Winthrop House has been undergoing renovations as a part of a larger project to renovate upperclassman Houses and is currently uninhabited.
Plans for Winthrop House include expanding living spaces, creating new common areas, and constructing Beren Hall, an extension of Gore Hall that will extend the House to the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets. According to deLuzuriaga, the renovation budget and scheduling have not been affected by the fire.

Dozens gathered in the Yard Monday to express support for transgender rights, protesting President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind federal protections for transgender students that allowed them to use the bathroom that fits their gender identity.
“[Transgender students] are embraced and supported here and we don’t stand for this kind of attack,” Noah R. Wagner ’18 said. “We will stand up and say no.”
Organized by the Trans Task Force, the rally was intended to provide a “cathartic experience for those affected” by Trump’s policies, according to Farris M. Peale ’18. Speakers suggested providing more gender neutral bathrooms on campus, creating gender neutral freshmen housing, and maintaining relationships with other identity groups on campus.
Members of other student groups on campus, including the Harvard Islamic Society and the Black Students Association, joined the rally in solidarity with the Trans Task Force.
“We have to some extent protection in Massachusetts, in Cambridge, and at Harvard, but want to continue expressing our opposition to the attacks that Trump’s administration and the Republicans broadly are making on vulnerable communities,” Wagner said.
Wagner said they believe the College should provide better accommodations to trans students, pointing in particular to the lack of gender neutral housing for freshman students. While all rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors have been able to request gender neutral housing in the upperclassman Houses since 2014, freshman who prefer gender-neutral housing must contact the BGLTQ Office and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
“There is a lot that Harvard is yet to do,” Peale said in an interview after the rally.
Lispeth J. Tibbits-Nutt, a BGLTQ specialty proctor in Holworthy and speaker at the rally, enumerated the resources available to transgender students and said she is always willing to talk if students need support.
“In a time when there are so many different issues begging to be fought over, continuing to come together is extremely important,” she said.
Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, who assumed his position as the director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life this month, also spoke at the rally.
“I wish we didn’t have to tell the world that trans rights matter,” Scarborough said to the crowd.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

For thousands of Harvard undergraduates a new, if odd, image has become ubiquitous on their Facebook newsfeeds: the face of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Enterprising students have photoshopped Khurana’s smiling visage onto a number of icons of popular culture, including Ke$ha, Liam Neeson, and Spongebob Squarepants, as part of a new Facebook group whose size has grown rapidly in the last few weeks.
Khurana is one of the most regular references in the group, titled “Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens,” that now boasts more than 5,000 members.
The posts often adhere to the internal logic of internet memes—including “starter packs,” which include photos of items necessary for success in certain endeavors—and offer humorous commentary on student life at Harvard. Many focus on students’ academic performance, concentration choice, and Khurana’s stated goal of providing a “transformational” undergraduate experience.
In one post with over 900 likes, a photo of a supine skeleton is captioned with white bubble-letters that reads “still waiting to catch a meal sometime,” mocking students’ tendency to commit to meals with friends without ever following through.
Started as a simple Facebook page by Rebecca Chen ’20 on Feb. 4, Harvard Memes quickly gained a large following that same day. After the page continued to grow, Chen changed it from a page to an official Facebook group.
It started with a few memes that Chen herself put up on the page. Chen said she was particularly fond of one meme mocking how Lamont security guards check the pencil-sized pocket on the front of backpacks.While the page has been home to hundreds of posts from dozens of Harvard students, Chen remains the sole moderator and gatekeeper for the meme group.
“I’m very pleased,” said Chen of the group’s success. “Of course, not everyone is as funny as me, and not everyone makes memes like I do, but I do appreciate it when people try.”
The group is strictly for Harvard specific memes. On the homepage, Chen spells out the parameters matter-of-factly “if the meme could apply to any group of wealthy, pretentious pseudo-intellectuals, at least Photoshop a Harvard logo in there somewhere.”
Chen’s vision for the group came from similar meme-meccas at University of California Berkeley and UC Los Angeles, where tens of thousands are in the groups. While Harvard’s scene isn’t quite as bustling as at Berkeley and UCLA, some Crimson pop culture connoisseurs are faring quite well.
Elton Lossner ’19 said he has enjoyed the success of his skeleton-meme.
“I’m kind of amused by [all the likes], but I find it sort of weird to be proud of a meme,” he said.
Lossner said the catch-a-meal skeleton was his second foray into the group.
“The second one was something I had come up with as I sat in the dining hall, because I realized that it’s sort of a reverse marketing thing,” Lossner said. “The meal getting thing becomes something very irritating that you never actually do.”
“On the bright side though a lot of people tagged their friends in it, so maybe it helped facilitate some friendship saving,” he added.
Posts in the group refer to a number of additional Harvard landmarks, including popular introductory courses “Economics 10: Principles of Economics” and “Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science,” as well as complaints about traveling to the Quad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 28, 2017 at 7:46 p.m. 
University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Washington D.C. Monday for the second time this year, promising at a media roundtable to continue lobbying lawmakers on Harvard’s key policy priorities under the Trump administration.
Faust outlined these priorities—maintaining research funding, defending the University endowment’s tax-exempt status, and protecting students and faculty impacted by President Donald Trump’s immigration policies—to members of the media gathered at Bloomberg News’ Washington Bureau Monday afternoon. Faust first identified the three policy areas as the foci of her political advocacy at a December faculty meeting.
Faust’s trip to Washington, D.C. Monday is a sign she is indeed “ramping up” advocacy efforts as she said she would in December. She met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in January, and plans to travel to Washington to meet with members of Congress again in late April.
While the total amount of research funding Harvard receives annually has increased, federal funding has steadily declined since 2009—a trend Faust called “devastating” at the Bloomberg meeting. Harvard receives nearly $600 million from the federal government, primarily from the National Institute of Health.
“NIH is a major focus of concern for us,” Faust told journalists.
She also reiterated the importance of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a government agency Trump may defund.
“The NEH is a critical source of support for the humanities and spreading the humanities beyond the academy and supporting individuals who are going into a field that is being increasingly marginalized in the consciousness of American life,” Faust said.
Referring to Trump by name—which Faust has refrained from doing in her public statements responding to his policies—she expressed concern about the budget blueprint his administration sent to federal agencies Monday.
“When we look at the nature of the budget that Trump is said to be considering, with huge increases in defense spending and no reductions in entitlements, it’s not clear where the kind of support would come from’’ to maintain research funding, the Boston Globe reported Faust said.
Faust criticized the Trump administration more pointedly at the event Monday than she has in the past.
“This administration seems unpredictable in many ways,’’ Faust told assembled journalists, according to the Globe. “It doesn’t seem tied to the traditional notions of the role of government. And so [the new administration’s] understanding of this long relationship between federal government and higher education is unclear to us.’’
Faust also told attendees at the Bloomberg event she is “very concerned” for the “safety and welfare of our students, our undocumented students, immigrants who are students and faculty and those who come to conferences and bring international perspectives that are key to learning and discovery.”
Since assuming office on Jan. 20, Trump has passed a series of executive orders aimed at deporting undocumented immigrants and restricting entry to the United States for refugees and immigrants from select predominantly-Muslim countries.
Harvard has around 40 undocumented students at the College according to some estimates and about 10,000 international students and scholars at the University. At least four Harvard affiliates were unable to enter the United States because of Trump’s policies.
At Monday’s meeting, Faust voiced apprehension that a climate hostile to immigrants might detract from Harvard’s ability to attract international faculty members.
“Who are we going to lose if enormously talented people don’t feel welcome here?” she asked.

Katie M. Derzon,the College’s recently-appointed undocumented student fellow, has partnered with other College administrators to present "a series of concrete recommendations" for supporting undocumented students by the end of the semester.
Derzon, a sociology graduate student and tutor in Leverett House, assumed her position earlier this month. She said she meets with undocumented students “one-on-one to work to answer questions as they occur.”
“I connect them to resources—legal, social, psychological—that exist on-campus and off-campus on occasion to make sure they are equipped to deal with some of the challenges they are facing,” Derzon said.
Derzon holds weekly office hours, and the working group consists of administrators from other parts of the College—such as the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid—to support both current and prospective undocumented students. The group meets monthly, she said.
Within the working group, Derzon said she researches other schools’ approaches to support undocumented students who are protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive order issued by former President Barack Obama in 2012.
Specifically, Derzon said “Dream Centers,” organizations at schools in the University of California system that serve as resource centers for undocumented students, peaked her interest for potential changes to implement at Harvard.
So far, Derzon said she sees connecting students to legal resources as her first priority. She pointed to Jason M. Corral, a staff attorney at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, as one of those resources.
“Making sure that students have somebody who can answer the legal questions they face vis-a-vis employment or travel, continuing to have those supports for me is the most vital,” she said.
However, Derzon said she hopes to continue to “talk to students over the course of the semester and hear from them where they feel like the gaps exist.”
She added: “I don’t want to assume that I know what their explicit needs are.”
Enrique Ramirez ’17, an undocumented student at the College and member of Act on a Dream, called Derzon’s work to support undocumented students is “amazing” and “unprecedented.”
“It’s really a sign that the University is trying to help undocumented students with resources in all dimensions of life like mental health, financial resources, [and] study abroad resources,” Ramirez said.
Jin Park ’19, another undocumented student at the College, said that having Derzon as a fellow is a step in the right direction, but wants to see more “political advocacy” from Harvard administration.
“There are so many more things that Harvard can do because of its role as a leader in American and international education, but I guess the first step is really encouraging,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2017 at 11:33 a.m. 
The Harvard-Allston Flexible Fund Executive Committee met at the Honan-Allston Branch Library Monday evening to debate the Boston Parks and Recreation Department’s revised grant application for a $1.9 million renovation of Smith Field.
Harvard allocated the $5.35 million flexible fund for unspecified public improvements in Allston as part of a $43 million community benefits package detailed in its Institutional Master Plan. The Boston Planning and Development Agency administers the fund.
According to Gerald Autler, senior project manager at the BPDA, the fund's intent is to support “primarily physical improvements to public property in the neighborhood.”
Allston residents have identified Smith Field, located near the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave., as a site in need of improvement. In addition to an amphitheater and “multipurpose natural grass field” to accommodate various sports, BPRD’s proposal includes an improved playground, updated street hockey court, and additional pathways.
“For years, as I’ve worked in the neighborhood, I’ve heard from many residents that they feel like Smith Field, a 15-acre park, is a great resource, but they feel like it does a better job of serving residents from around the city, around the region, than it does serving residents of the neighborhood,” said Autler.
During the first grant cycle in 2016, the committee received a proposal from BPRD asking for $2.5 million to support their Smith Field master plan, but allocated $185,000 to the Smith Park project to commission a more detailed design and cost plan, according to Autler. The current proposal represents a $400,000 decrease over last year’s grant application.
Autler noted that in 2016 the group “didn’t feel comfortable giving away half of the fund in grant cycle one, out of the gate.”
According to Autler, the Smith Field project was “widely embraced” by the neighborhood.
“[Members of the executive committee] felt like this $5.3 million fund should probably, in addition to supporting a lot of smaller projects, support one or two really high-impact projects,” Autler said. “Most people saw the Smith Field as an obvious candidate to be one of those.”
BPRD has since returned with a revised application. The construction estimates and design fees total $6,285,000. The City of Boston Capital Improvement Fund has footed $3.3 million of the bill, and three other sources contributed about $1 million. The BPRD is now requesting $1.9 million from the fund to cover the rest of its costs and complete the first phase of this project.
In an emailed statement, Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Harvard Public Affairs & Communications, praised the seven projects the flexible fund supported last year.
“Based on this early success we are excited by the prospects for year two and beyond,” he wrote.
The BPRD hopes to break ground either late summer or early fall of this year, with project completion slated for the summer of 2019.

Cambridge City Councillors formally requested that the Cambridge Historical Commission consider designating the Abbott Building in Harvard Square as a historical landmark at its weekly meeting Monday.
The request comes after investment firm Equity One, which owns a number of properties in the Square, announced plans to renovate the building, a move which would displace the world’s only Curious George store. The Historical Commission has previously decided not to initiate a study, but an online petition with over 5,000 signatures helped compel the Councillors to ask the commission to reconsider.
“There are only a few gems that give the really Square character.” Councillor Dennis J. Carlone said. “And in the heart of the square, it’s this building.”
At the meeting, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale and City Councillors lauded the recent announcement that Cambridge was one of only 35 municipalities in the United States to receive an AAA credit rating. The rating, which the city has received every year since 1999, allows Cambridge to invest more money into projects at a lower interest rate.
This announcement comes as the city begins to issue additional bonds. Last week, the city sold $2 million in minibonds and will sell another $59.4 million in bonds beginning March 1. Those bonds will help fund a number of capital projects in the city, including a Community Complex for Cambridge Street Upper School, sewer reconstruction, and street reconstruction, among others.
Councillors also unanimously approved new zoning regulations for businesses in Central Square.
The new zoning regulations change a variety of restrictions and building requirements in the Central Square zoning area. The ordinance includes new definitions for chain businesses, new requirements for yards and open spaces, and modified requirements for parking.
A number of Cantabrigians and Councillors alike spoke out in favor of the new regulations, discussing everything from the need to improve business development to the cooperation that took place to reach the final draft.
“With the hard work of the petitioners, with the hard work of the neighborhood, things like this can happen” Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said. “I hope we continue to see that all over the city.”
The Council also approved $2.3 million to finance the design and installation of new fields at Russell Field and Graham & Parks School.
Councillors also discussed the City Manager’s search for a new Police Commissioner. City officials will be holding two public forums later this week in order to learn about qualities residents wish to see in the new commissioner and the biggest challenges facing Cambridge police.

Analyzing the international dynamics of the long-running conflict, University of London lecturer Christopher Phillips discussed his latest book on the Syrian Civil War at the Harvard Kennedy School on Monday.
Moderated by Kennedy School Professor Stephen M. Walt, the seminar provided contrasting perspectives on the external factors that influenced the middle-eastern region. Phillips, a guest lecturer, emphasized the tendency for the conflict’s different participants to escalate tensions rather than pursue peace, a subject his new book, “The Battle for Syria: International Rivalry in the New Middle East,” focuses on.
Citing the different interests of Russia, Turkey, and other parties within Syria, he said the conditions surrounding the conflict emerged due to a power vacuum caused by a “Post-American Middle East.”
In particular, he argued that the accepted American policy of minimizing “boots on the ground” in the aftermath of Iran, combined with assertive regional powers and misinterpretation, created conditions that promoted conflict over de-escalation within Syria.
During the talk, Phillips focused on former President Obama’s decision to call for Bashar al-Assad to stand aside in August 2011, a move he called an “uninformed political decision,” and attempted to explain its implications.
“What occurs is that [Obama] and his team in the White House believe that Assad’s regime is going to collapse anyway, and then there’s a strong view that they must appear on the right side of history,” Phillips said. “Importantly, this is a politically motivated decision and not one based off of intelligence.”
Phillips said that despite wanting to step back, the U.S. and other Western countries still use the language of a dominant force in the region. He said states like Russia and Turkey then respond to this language by implementing policy changes to their military, furthering an environment prone to conflict.
“The civil war in Syria can thus be seen as both partly the product of and a reinforcer of this Post-American Middle East,” Phillips said.
In a moderated discussion toward the end of the event, attendees offered alternative viewpoints and clarifying questions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Undergraduate Council leaders detailed plans to create a centralized guide for student groups’ comp processes, Harvard students say they are excited about the proposal.
UC representatives began discussing a potential guide to comps last spring. During their Nov. campaign, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said they were interested in centralizing information about groups’ comps—an admissions process many undergraduate organizations use to select members.
Currently, the Q Guide—the College's course and instructor evaluation system—allows students to provide feedback on classes, professors, and teaching fellows. There is presently no consolidated system that lets students share feedback on comp processes.
In an email to undergraduates Monday, Sachee and Khansarinia said they would create a separate guide to evaluate comps along several criteria.
“We’re making a Q-Guide for comps that would allow all of us to submit feedback on the comp processes in which we've partaken and our experiences with them (i.e. how many hours it took per week, how much money we spent, how we’d rate it, etc.) much like the current centralized Q-Guide for classes and professors,” the email reads.
Khansarinia said he and Sachee have already begun reaching out to student organizations, and hope to have a guide up and running in fall 2017. While it will be a UC-driven initiative, Khansarinia said the College will help with HUIT protections and security. Students' submissions to the Q Guide will remain anonymous.
“We’ve reached out to several student organizations and the ones we have reached out to have received it positively,” he said.
Several students said they are excited about the proposal, and think it would increase transparency in student group admissions.
Mary F. Broker ’20 said she thought a Q Guide for comps would help students recognize what skills different organizations look for in compers.
“I think it would be a good idea to know more about the processes and to understand what people are looking for,” she said.
David S. H. Lim ’17 said a comp Q Guide would help freshmen in particular navigate Harvard’s extracurricular groups. Lim said that during his freshman year, he did not have any resources to explore various comps.
“I had no idea, it was just word of mouth, you know, when you were asking around what comps do,” he said. “[A Q Guide] could be useful I think.”
Others, like Devon L. Black ’19, said a system like this could help students make informed decisions about which comps are worth their time.
“I definitely think it would be helpful to weed out what comps aren't really worth the work like for my perspective for what I'm hoping to get out of the club,” she said.
While specific questions and categories for the Q Guide are yet to be determined, Black suggested asking “what the requirements for comping are,” as well as “what the social life is like inside the club.”

To no one’s surprise, RiRi was flawless. But we still found ourselves floored by her grace and beauty in the flesh and admittedly almost burst into tears a few times during her recognition ceremony as the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year. If you weren’t lucky enough to be blessed with her highness Robyn Rihanna Fenty’s presence this afternoon (or had a class conflict which rudely prevented you from a life-changing experience), here are the highlights.
Her Outfit
The fashion icon served an undeniably perfect look. Sporting a professional knee-length grey dress suit, she elegantly looked the part of honoree and matched the erudite tone of the Sanders Theater backdrop. But our favorite “bad girl” still managed to pack a signature punch, steering from the too-tame with a daring leg slit and matching thigh-high grey boots.
Rakesh Stole A Kiss
Even Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana was starstruck, giddily waving his hands and beaming as he greeted and introduced the sensation. He soon slipped back into his comfort zone however, as he still managed to lecture Rihanna on Harvard’s—you guessed it—“transformative” experience as he welcomed her to our “diverse” community. After his speech wrapped up, he went over to shake her hand when suddenly the pair exchanged a heart-racing cheek kiss that got the crowd hollering and on our feet. Needless to say, witnessing that interaction was the single most transformative experience we’ve ever had and ever will have at Harvard.
Puns
The student speakers from the Harvard Foundation (who also were graced with physical Rihanna contact) managed to creatively integrate a few lyrical puns into their speeches, even making RiRi giggle. Yousra Neberai ‘18 praised her humanitarian “work, work, work.” Then Dylan de Wart ‘19 quipped Rihanna is one of the only people who can “tweet a leader that he ‘better have her money,’” referencing when she rallied her Twitter base to call on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to raise $20 million for an education fund. We’re just a little disappointed “Rude Boy” or “S & M” didn’t get mentions, cause that really would have had Rakesh blushing.
“So I made it to Harvard”
Rihanna’s charming opening line warranted another standing ovation from the eager student audience, the majority of whom had their Snapchat cameras poised to capture the moment. Yes we heard the “no recording” announcement, but I’m sorry, how could we not compulsively photograph our childhood and adult hero as she stood mere yards away?!
Adorable Child
As if the empowering talk of intersectional feminism and Rihanna’s plea to “help our neighbors” (YES, we will literally do anything you say) didn’t get us emotional, the ceremony’s conclusion really tugged on our heartstrings. Seemingly out of nowhere, an adorable well-spoken little boy (our very own Chase, son of the Winthrop House faculty deans) hopped on the stage, presenting Rihanna with flowers and praise “on behalf of the children of Cambridge.” As she embraced the child and flashed her brilliant smile, we could hardly keep it together.
