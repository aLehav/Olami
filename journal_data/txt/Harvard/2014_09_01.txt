After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW DELHI—I am afraid that landlord uncle will think I am a slut. The first time we meet he assures me in proper Hindi that my flatmate is seedhi, straight—a good girl—and that I seem seedhi too. I clasp my hands together, thinking of the boys I will have over, the homosexuals, the rum.
The Hobby Lobby decision and newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s health minister’s comment that HIV should be targeted not with condoms but with Indian culture come out the same week. It’s sloppy to equate fundamentalisms, but I’m struck by it. Friends I talk to in India are bewildered by the way birth control is regulated in the U.S., contradicting the movie image of America as a progressive land of boundless sex.
But the preference for the married, the reproductive, and the heterosexual persists. Common to both Rush Limbaugh and the Delhi ladies who stare censoriously at my cleavage is a fear: that America is a paradise of divorce-horny single women doped up on progesterone perpetually spreading their well-gapped thighs. A land of gender nonconforming homosexuals penetrating each other in orifices no god-fearing human would love. And that these brands of sexuality are contagious.
Humans, it turns out, are very skilled at projecting sexual excess onto racial and national others. This is a technology of empire: one of the reasons, for example, why colonial sodomy law was put on books in the first place. It is also the reason why the moment I unveil my national identity a red, white, and blue welcome sign unfurls from my hips. And this is why no one, even now, in all the finger-pointing, seems to be able to figure out who is kinkier or gayer or more slutty: the former colonizers or the formerly colonized.
When I have people over we kiss hello on the cheek in the car park, a surge of Indian-Iranian-American-Spanish love, and charge upstairs hand in hand past the open door of the landlord. I say I am afraid he will judge me. My friends say relax.
Anyway, my friend says, floating toward me in a drooping white shirt in the car park, a bag of ice dripping from his hands, "Of course you're a slut. All free-thinking women are, aren't they?"
Travellers are too often tricked into thinking that the authentic of a place its in its orthodox, its normative. But just as real are those whom nationalism, with its bossy posturing of authenticity, shuns: the leftist, the Grindr-fluent, the tough-talking feminists, the pissed-off queers.
Another friend says, "Be evil. Make people confused about things they hold to be their truth.”
And then it is getting late and we are getting tipsy and there is work tomorrow, so we kiss goodbye in the car park, this time on the mouth, and I return upstairs to lie under the hum of the fan, and fall asleep with all the windows open, and all the doors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1971, United States shocked the world when President Nixon effectively ended the Bretton-Woods system by taking the dollar off the gold standard. The founders of the Bretton-Woods system, having just come out of the Great Depression, were insecure about financial markets—and gold was thought to be just the backbone needed to stave off another economic disaster.
Liberal economists such as Paul Krugman have argued that the Federal Reserve executed that move in order to keep the dollar as the primary currency trade note in the world, as has been the case. The American dollar has become the de facto fiat currency of the world—composing 61 percent of IMF currency holdings today.
But Nixon’s move had consequences: one immediate and one that remains consequential to this day. The first was the so-called “Nixon Shock,” where global markets reacted negatively to the news. The International Monetary Fund tired of ameliorating the “Nixon Shock” and stated that exchanges through the IMF may be done through any type of trade except gold—and so the world turned its eyes to oil just as prices began to skyrocket in the 1970s.
And so Western powers traded their gold hegemony for a different kind of hegemony grounded in the oil trade and the U.S. dollar, which went unchallenged for decades.
Now through multilateral cooperation by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—the so-called BRICS countries—a new challenger titled the BRICS Development Bank has emerged to take on the international economic order.
Just as the Bretton-Woods system based currencies including the dollar on gold, the BRICS countries have developed a system where international investments and trade are based on power politics. This is important because the BRICS nations today account for much of the dollars invested in the oil trade today with trading partners in Eastern Europe, Middle Eastern partners of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OAPEC, Indonesia, and Venezuela.
The simple move by BRICS is obviously a threat to the current order; the U.S. could lose its position as a major economic power in terms of the oil trade and the position of the dollar as a fiat currency—things it traded the Bretton-Woods system of gold hegemony for. The entire oil trade could be decentralized from dollars to local currencies, and with it, power would shift away from its current Western center.
King Faisal similarly shifted trade from dollars to local currencies in 1973 when Saudi Arabia ended oil supplies through OAPEC due to the Yom Kippur War, which pressured the U.S. to force Israel to pullout from Egypt. Of course, such actions are not sought as we live in an inter-connected world today where diplomacy at international forums such as the United Nations reigns. However, leverage is important, and the capability of the BRICS to pull off such a move is present. This can also gradually happen through its current system as well; buying the dollar, diluting it by cashing it out, and trading it for local currency for investment to clients in developing nations such as in Africa or South Asia.
The BRICS Development Bank was developed to support nations who have felt underrepresented in investment projects—an objective necessarily interlinked with the political actions. Much of the world is frustrated with the IMF—and the BRICS Development Bank will be a counter to policies that are frequently seen as out of touch and reincarnated tool of Western colonialism.
While the bank has not yet flexed its muscles, it certainly has the firepower to change the future of international economic development.

Each year, the Opening Days program gives freshmen a feel for the flavor of Harvard. One taste comes in an email sent out to all freshmen informing them of a separate workshop on sexual assault issues affecting LGBTQ individuals—and it’s a bitter one. Although it’s admirable that the administration has worked to become more sensitive to the needs of Harvard’s LGBTQ community, in the interest of true equality the segregated assault workshops require an overhaul.
As of now, students are required to attend at least one sexual assault workshop, but they may attend both the workshop aimed at straight and at the one aimed at LGBTQ individuals. This allows students who are still questioning or uncomfortable to learn about the risks they might face, without necessarily “outing” themselves. It also allows any student to explore the issue from multiple perspectives. But in the past several years, according to former Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response director Sarah Rankin, attendance numbers have hovered around 20 people in the LGBTQ workshop. Such low turnouts may indicate that students feel the LGBTQ workshop still carries a stigma. It is statistically unlikely that so few freshmen are members of a sexual- or gender-minority, which suggests that many who could have benefited from the workshop chose to avoid it instead.
Requiring both workshops for all students would ensure that all closeted or questioning students have access to information that could significantly affect their time at Harvard, both on and off campus. In an interview, Dr. Kyle Gobrogge, who attended last year’s LGBTQ workshop in his capacity as a freshman proctor, told me he would like to see more focus on sexual harassment situations outside the University. Although this criticism could be applied to the heterosexual workshop as well, LGBTQ students are in an especially vulnerable situation because, due to their minority status, they often attend bars or dating sites that cater to the LGBTQ community outside of Harvard. This may be especially true for closeted students—exactly the kind of freshmen who might shy away from attending the LGBTQ workshop.
Even straight students would benefit from learning about the issues that face their transgendered or queer peers: Doing so would enable them to reach out properly and effectively in the event of a sexual assault. A 2011 report by the Harvard College Women’s group noted that administrators do not seem to focus on bringing LGBTQ-centric information to the college as a whole. Harvard works to make students of all backgrounds aware of specific difficulties that face students of racial minorities; there is not a separate Community Conversations event during Opening Days for white students and black students. Likewise, issues of LGBTQ-discrimination affect the entire community, and therefore the entire community should be made aware of them.
Under-attendance also leads to other problems in the LGTBQ workshop. As a student identifying as pansexual, I may be in situations involving both male and female partners. Therefore, the types of assault that I may have to deal with will be essentially different from students who are lesbian, or who are transgendered. Although we often see it as a homogenous group, the LGBTQ community consists of numerous identities and orientations. But not all of these were represented in the workshop, and so the issues affecting some groups received less airtime than others.
The primary focus last year was on gay men. This demographic was also the most represented at the workshop—by a considerable margin. It can be crushing as a member of a sexual minority to be sidelined even in parts of campus specifically set aside for your benefit. We must seek diversity within diversity, and be aware of where we fall short. For example, the 2011 study found that biphobia—the lack of acceptance of identifying bisexuals, even in LGBTQ communities—was still prevalent on campus, noting reports of “pervasive bisexual discrimination across campus.” There may be pragmatic concerns to continuously diversifying the workshop, but a meaningful step would be to extend the workshop so that all sexual minorities—and their specific concerns—get attention.
We must not be complacent regarding LGBTQ rights. Especially after the recent advances we have seen in gay rights, it might be easy to say that we no longer have to consider these issues a priority. And yet there are many people in the country—and probably some on campus—who disagree, sometimes vehemently, with this kind of progressivism. It is particularly important during this time that we be aware of any implicit biases we have. Those starting their careers at Harvard deserve access to specific information that will ensure their safety. True equality will only be achieved when LGBTQ students can become fully integrated, so they are not queer students, but simply students.

Less than two months ago, somewhere between the hot surface of concrete and an unforgiving arm around his neck, rang these muffled words: “I can’t breathe.” Repeatedly, “I can’t breathe,” and still a New York City police officer’s chokehold continued to siphon away the life of Eric Garner. Those cries fell upon the deaf ears of those sworn to protect and serve. Minutes later, he was dead.
Witnesses say Garner had just broken up a fight. The police officers confronted Garner for selling untaxed cigarettes. Weighing over 350 pounds, it is unlikely that the asthmatic Garner was going to run away from the five officers who surrounded him. It is equally unlikely that the unarmed Garner posed such a threat that deadly force in the form of a chokehold was at all warranted.
When I watch the raw footage of his death, I cannot help but call it a public execution. I see a 43-year-old man who is clearly frustrated with being harassed by the police. Those police officers, rather than arrest him and allow him to face charges in the court of law, decided to use deadly force, ensuring that his children would never see him alive again.
The video is depressing, but if there is a silver lining in this unjustified killing, it is that the video allows the entire world to become a witness to the confrontation. It is pure, unadulterated police brutality. No matter how much the New York City Police Department or the right-wing media would like to spin the story in order to justify this killing, they can’t. The tape does not lie.
But a video camera could not save Eric Garner’s life. The 400 years of systematic dehumanization and exclusion that manifested in his racial profiling and death are forces that no piece of technology can overcome in short order. But the video camera did save his character before it too could be assassinated by the media and the New York City Police Department.
Notice how there is no ambiguity and no room for fabrication of facts in this case. This time, there is no room for Facebook pictures of gang signs being thrown up or hoodies being worn. No room for toxicology reports suggesting that Garner was under the influence at the time of his death. No room for reports that he reached for the police officer’s gun or violently resisted arrest. No, those tricks did not and will not work this time. Eric Garner’s character was saved by this video. This is the reason I believe that his death was ruled a homicide, rather than swept under the rug. His family and his community can confidently march forward seeking justice against those who took his life.
The arm that strangled Eric Garner is no different than the noose that strangled countless young black men throughout this nation’s history. People of color and those who value justice across this nation no longer accept extrajudicial killings as a part of life. Indeed, the fire this time that raged across Ferguson, Mo., over the summer in response to the shooting death of Michael Brown should serve as a message to the rest of this country that this nation cannot move forward until sweeping changes to local law enforcement are made.
A petition posted to the official White House website, calling for the creation of a law that would set aside funds and require all state, county, and local police to wear a camera while on duty, is a good place to start. We need this law. We need this law to deter police brutality, profiling, and abuse of power. We need this law so that no pundit can tarnish the memory of someone who can no longer speak for himself or herself.
We need this law, once and for all, so that the next time a young black man says he can’t breathe, the police officer grabbing his neck will think twice about using deadly force.

In June, the Cambridge City Council met to discuss the possibility of introducing regulations that would restrict the ability of Uber and similar services to operate in the city. On the table: a proposal that would place all app-based car services under the jurisdiction of Cambridge’s Hackney Unit, the organization that oversees the fleet of traditional taxis often seen idling in Harvard Square. The new regulations would require Uber drivers to register with the Hackney Unit or face fines, and GPS-based fare calculations, a cornerstone of Uber’s pricing model, would be banned.
Uber has been commenting on developments in the case through a blog entitled “The Cambridge License Commission vs. The People of Cambridge,” and has urged it supporters to get involved. The company is no stranger to controversy, and faces bans and restrictions in cities like Berlin. In August, Uber announced that it had hired David Plouffe, President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, to head its lobbying and public relations efforts as more cities follow Cambridge’s example and attempt to crack down on the service.
But heavy-handed regulations—at least those designed to level the playing field between taxis and Uber by curbing the latter—shouldn’t be allowed the thwart the rise of a service that represents a significant improvement over an outmoded and inefficient system. For many, using Uber is more cost-effective, more convenient, and more efficient than hailing a traditional cab. While no car service should be allowed to operate totally unfettered, governments should promote rather than stifle technological innovation and its manifold benefits.
As with any seismic shift within an industry, new companies will supplant old ones and jobs will be lost, at least temporarily. Uber’s impact on the transportation industry is being felt so acutely precisely because the old system was ripe for disruption. Demand for car services has not dried up—if anything, Uber and other services like Lyft portend an increase in the number of people taking private cars—meaning that higher unemployment and lower profits amongst taxi drivers are likely to be transitory phenomena as many drivers inevitably make the switch to Uber.
That being said, some regulations are obviously necessary from the standpoint of passenger safety and equality. There have been allegations of discrimination by Uber drivers against certain protected classes, including blind individuals. To remedy this issue, the state must ensure ensure equal access to transportation services such as Uber. The company must hold up its end by serving the public good, but Uber should be allowed to compete freely, in Cambridge and in cities around the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 1, 2014, at 11:09 p.m.
After a successful year of Harvard men’s rowing in which freshman lightweights coach Linda Muri guided the lightweight four to a silver medal at the 2014 IRA National Championship, Muri has decided to take the helm of women’s rowing at Dartmouth.
“Being a head coach is a new kind of challenge for me,” Muri said. “I wasn’t thinking about moving on this year, but when Dartmouth called me and asked me to apply, I thought I’d see what it was like…and consider my options.”
Muri’s move across the Ivy League comes one season after the Crimson named former Radcliffe lightweight women’s coach Michiel Bartman to be the new men’s lightweight crew coach for the 2013-2014 season.
As she continues on to her next position, Muri leaves behind a legacy of accolades from her 13 seasons at Harvard, including an exceptional 2010 season that featured a 10-0 lightweight freshman dual record and an EARC silver medal. In 2004, Muri also led the freshmen to the EARC Sprints title followed by Harvard’s first-ever victory at the IRA National Championship in the freshman 4+.
Additionally, Muri boasts an extensive resume as a competitor that includes being a nine-time U.S. national team member and a three-time world champion.
Muri was in Amsterdam for the World Rowing Championships over the weekend, coaching former Crimson standout Austin Meyer ’12 and Dartmouth oarsman Josh Konieczny ’13. But instead of the Crimson and Big Green competing against each other as they will this fall, Muri looked on as the two competed together, coming in fourth in the second final heat of the lightweight men's 2x.
Her time abroad with two former Ivy League greats gave the soon-to-be Dartmouth coach a chance to reflect on her years in Cambridge, she said.
“I was really excited to have the opportunity to be a head coach, but I really loved working at Harvard—it was the best experience I’ve had coaching,” Muri said. “I learned a lot from the coaches that I worked with, from Charley Butt to Harry Parker. But it was a special experience to work with the students, and leaving them [is] the hardest thing.”
In a statement released by Dartmouth College, Director of Athletics and Recreation Harry Sheehy expressed excitement at bringing Muri to the Big Green.
“I am thrilled to welcome [Muri] to Dartmouth,” Sheehy said. “She brings a wealth of world class and collegiate experience to go along with an unrivaled passion for teaching and coaching. The program is in wonderful hands with [Muri] at the helm.”
As she prepares to make the move to Hanover, Muri also recognized the successes of her Harvard coaching tenure and the lessons that the freshmen rowers and novices have taught her over the years.
“Patience is probably one of the biggest things [that I learned from my rowers],” Muri said. “I have to start over again every year with guys that have never rowed before and guys who were recruited, but I have to get them rowing the Harvard way, and it doesn’t just happen overnight.”
On the receiving end of Muri’s tutelage, the most recent class of Harvard freshmen felt the impact of having an experienced coach shape the beginnings of their Crimson rowing careers.
“Coach Muri has always been such a great role model for the rowers in everything she does,” said sophomore James Dreben, who coxed the freshmen eight to a silver medal at the EARC sprints. “I know that all the guys will say that she has made a huge difference not only in how we performed this past year, but also how much fun we had with the program.”
Sophomore lightweight rower Mark F. Steinbrick credited Muri for igniting  an excitement for the sport among those she coached.
“She just had a passion for the sport and made all of us share that passion with her,” Steinbrick said. “She’ll definitely be missed in the boathouse.”
