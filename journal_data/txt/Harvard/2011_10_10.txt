After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When musicians perform, they create a mood that lasts until the last patron leaves the concert hall—but it seldom moves listeners to cultural change. That sense of impact “is often what is missing for a musician,” said Kim Kashkashian, a violist who teaches at the New England Conservatory (NEC). “We work in isolation, and we perform in a kind of isolation on stage. We need a way to share the power of that music and make an actual, physical difference in people’s lives.”
A small ensemble of professional and student musicians at NEC, including Kashkashian, hopes to bridge this gap between music and action. On October 17, musicians will give a concert entitled “Music for Food” at 8 p.m. in NEC’s Brown Hall. This concert is one in a series of four. The others will be held on December 19, February 20, and April 16, all at the same location and at the same time. Though admission is free, audience members are asked to bring food, cash, or check donations to the concert hall in support of the Greater Boston Food Bank.
Among the performers are two professional musicians from New York, several professors from the conservatory, and one student. The program will include pieces by Béla Bartók, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Johannes Brahms, the repertoire a gift from the musicians involved to the greater community. “This is a musical offering of an absolutely high level musical performance,” said Kashkashian. “We are volunteering our time, energy, and talent to share the power of the music with the audience. It is the audience’s job to pass on this gift by giving to the Greater Boston Food Bank.”
NEC is in downtown Boston—close to Symphony Hall and Northeastern University­—and conservatory students live and work beside locals who struggle with food shortages on a daily basis. When the “Music for Food” musicians performed for the first time to fight hunger in 2010, one in 10 individuals in the surrounding community were not getting the food they needed. This year, the ratio has risen to one in nine individuals, according to the Greater Boston Food Bank. “This is still a young series, but I think we got an overwhelmingly positive response from last season,” said Deborah Pae, an NEC cello student playing in the benefit concert on October 17.
One of Kashkashian’s former students, Carol Rodland—Professor of Viola at the Eastman School of Music—founded the original “If Music Be the Food...” program, which has been successfully increasing the visibility of the hungry in Rochester, N.Y. since 2009. The Rochester series, whose title is inspired by a line from Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night,” serves as the model for the Boston series. Though the “Music for Food” series is not officially affiliated with NEC, conservatory musicians have formed several networks on campus for charity work. Another four-part series with an emphasis on chamber music will take place at the Women’s Lunch Place, a daytime shelter in downtown Boston, later in the year. Miriam Fried, a violinist playing in the “Music For Food” benefit, says that music teachers who are active in their community will help redefine the role of music and performance for current conservatory students. “Musicians need to be involved in the fabric of society in any way that they can. This is a real help to the community, but beyond that it is a constant reminder to students that we all should share in the feeling of responsibility,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Oscar nominee and Emmy Award-winner Laura Linney, visiting Harvard may have felt like coming home. The New York native’s heart lives in New England, she said, and she not only misses being a student, but also loves teaching.
“Part of the reason why I love coming back to schools and talking to students is, I think, I just have a desire to go back to school. I dream about going back to school. I dream about filling out applications,” she laughs. “I dream about going to campuses. I dream about it all the time. I think it’s because there is that pure concentration that is allowed in an environment like this that doesn’t happen anywhere else. So I constantly have that sort of hunger for thought hanging in the air a little bit. For the time to consider.”
And consider she does. Linney exuded an air of thoughtfulness throughout her conversation with Thomas S. Lee, the director of the Learning from Performers program at the Office for the Arts at Harvard. Her soft-spoken yet powerful presence captivated the New College Theatre last Thursday. for over an hour and a half of discussion.
But thoughtfulness is nothing new for Linney, who spent a year at Northwestern University before transferring to Brown University and later graduating from The Juilliard School. And her hunger for learning has never subsided.
“What I love about theater is that you are constantly a student, for the rest of your life. You are handed a script and you are placed in a certain time in history with its own politics and culture, and you have to know where you are, so you get to constantly study history, music, politics, entertainment, culture, society ... and I love that,” she said.
Linney’s instinct to follow her passion has guided her career from a young age. “It was about the space for me ... it wasn’t about Broadway, it was more about the community of the theater, coming together in the space to create something ... [I] could have been in the box office, could have been the stage manager, could have been hanging lights,” she said. Now, she chooses roles according to what she needs. “I try not to go more than every other season [without doing theater],” she said. “Otherwise that skill just goes.” As for film, “there has to be one of three things: either a great director, a great co-star, or a great script. There has to be one of those. If there are two of them, that is pretty good. If there are all three—slam dunk.”
And for television? “It depends on the people. It always depends on the people,” she said.
As for acting advice, Linney advised students to steer away from “skipping steps.” In one example, she explained, “There is an enormous amount of work that happens to get to that point where an eyebrow will lift.” She proceeded to enumerate the steps as she sees them. “You would be surprised at what it takes to get there, so that when the eyebrow lifts, it is connected to the face that it is on, and then that is connected to the thought that makes the eyebrow rise, and that [thought] is connected to whatever the character is seeing that causes the thought that makes the eyebrow rise. If you skip steps, that is when I become either uninterested in what I am watching or uninterested in what I am doing,” she said.
After her conversation with Lee, Linney took nearly 20 minutes to greet eager fans and other attendees. Then she sat down for a private interview with The Harvard Crimson, where she opened up even more, munching on mixed nuts with her husband at her side.
Elaborating on her newer work, like playing the character of cancer patient Cathy Jamison on “The Big C,” she said, “I am a believer that you have to be very careful in exploiting your own pain.”
“[My pain] is not the character’s pain,” she continued. “And [my pain] is going to bleed through anyway. But if I rely on it—if I substitute it, if I cut and paste my pain, my experience into a character, it will not fit. It will not organically knit to the material, to the situation, to that character.”
When not on set or on stage, Linney does what she can to maintain boundaries between her and her personal life. “[Just] as it is a skill to apply yourself to a profession or to a vocation, it is also a skill to apply yourself to living and life. And it requires just as much time—it is not easy.”
Consequently, she and her husband have chosen Connecticut and Colorado as their permanent residences. “I have a whole other very unexpected life in the Rockies. Who knew? I walk around sometimes and think, ‘What am I doing here? I cannot believe I have such a great life here.’”
Though Linney said Hollywood can be a draining atmosphere, at the end of the day she is grateful to be doing what she is doing and is not preoccupied about leaving a legacy. “I just hope I get better. I don’t need to live forever—to make a mark, or leave a footprint. I do not feel that pressure, fortunately.”
Nonetheless, she cannot help but inspire younger artists. Ryan P. Halprin ’12, a Hasty Pudding actor and aspiring professional, said he felt humbled by her accomplishments. “If I understood acting and could turn that understanding into practice as well as she does, I think that would be an incredibly fulfilling career. To be able to touch that many viewers, to be able to be that kind of actor who plays real and emotional characters and tell stories that other people can relate with—that millions of people can relate with ... I think that would be an amazing life to lead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher A. Sims ’63 and Thomas J. Sargent have been awarded the  Nobel Prize in Economics. Both economists received their Ph.Ds from  Harvard in 1968.
Sims, a professor at Princeton, and Sargent, a  professor at New York University, received the award for their work  modeling the impact of central bank and government policies on  macro-economic growth.
Although Sims and Sargent researched independently, the announcement  says that both of their contributions are essential to the study of  macroeconomics.
The announcement highlights the difficulty of their  research, which focuses on untangling the two-way relationship between  fiscal policy and the economy.
“The Laureates’ methods can be applied to identify these causal  relationships and explain the role of expectations,” the award citation  says.
Harvard Professor of Political Economy Alberto F. Alesina said the committee made an excellent choice.
“It’s a great prize, very well deserved,” he said. “Both Sargent and  Sims made an enormous contribution to our understanding of macro  [economics] ... and fiscal policy.”
At a press conference, Sims expressed his gratitude for receiving the prize along with Sargent.
“I have been telling people I wouldn’t be getting the prize, but I couldn’t be happier getting it with my colleague,” Sims said.
The  Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said the  knowledge gained from Sims’ and Sargent’s work would help policymakers  more accurately predict the influence their policies could have on  outcomes such as falling productivity and rising inflation.
“They addressed the ‘central and classical’ questions in economics,” the announcement says.
The  award—like the other Nobel prizes considered the most prestigious in  its field—is not one of the original prizes established by Alfred Nobel  in 1895, but was endowed in 1968 by Sweden’s central bank.
For the past few years, members of the Harvard Economics Department have  run a pool allowing people to predict the next winner of the Nobel  Prize in Economics. But the site was shut down this year.
The site  reads: “Unfortunately, we have been advised by Harvard University to  immediately shut down the Nobel pool due to legal reasons, and we have  decided to comply with this request.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren raised $3.15 million for  her Senate campaign in the third quarter—bringing in more in that period  than any Senate candidate across the nation in the previous quarter.
The fundraising total dwarfs the amount raised by Warren’s opponents in  the Democratic field, and trumps incumbent Republican Senator Scott  Brown’s sum by a ratio of roughly two to one.
As of the third  quarter’s end, Brown’s war chest totals $10.5 million. In polls, he  remains slightly ahead of Warren, commanding 41 percent of the vote to  Warren’s 38 percent in a poll of registered voters conducted earlier  this month by the Boston Herald.
Warren’s funding came mostly from small donations. Ninety six percent of  her contributions were donations of $100 or less, with a total of  11,000 Massachusetts residents giving to her campaign.
The majority  of the donations flooded in after Warren announced her candidacy two  weeks ago, according to a statement from the candidate.
Warren’s high-profile entrance into the race has transformed the competition for the Democratic nomination.
Both  Newton mayor Setti Warren and activist Robert K. Massie have already  dropped out of the race, each citing fundraising difficulties as a  reason for their exit.
“The attention given to the many qualities of Elizabeth Warren have  fundamentally changed how all the candidates operate in this race, and  it had particular consequences for me,” Massie told The Boston Globe.
But  City Year co-founder Alan A. Khazei ’83—who is currently Warren’s most  formidable opponent within the Democratic field—said publicly that he  has the funds to compete against Warren in the in the year leading up to  the Democratic primaries.
Khazei has also criticized Warren for accepting funds from political  action committees, a source of support which he claims to have refused.
Khazei raised $365,000 this quarter, the second largest sum among Massachusetts Democratic candidates.
“Candidates are reassessing, based on the inability to raise money,”  Khazei’s spokesperson Scott Ferson told The Boston Globe. “We don’t have  that problem. Alan is in this for the long haul.”
More details about Warren’s fundraising will be released next weekend, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank in the middle of Boston's financial district, an unusual cityscape has sprouted. Neat rows of brightly-colored tents, waving banners, and scrawled posters now command the green space in Dewey Square, and serve as one of the central meeting places for the Occupy Boston movement.
The little metropolis of around one hundred tents is well-organized, with individual shelters dedicated to food, medical care, logistical information, media, and meditation. Protesters and curious passerby alike pick their way between the muddy rows, greeted by welcoming calls from those within.
So far, the protest has been markedly more serene than protests in New York for Occupy Wall Street, where over 700 participants were arrested over the course of a single day.
"I want to insert peace into the process of achieving peace," said Robin J. Lutjohann, a helper in the meditation tent and student at Harvard Divinity School.
"We need something more than just another rally."

Hundreds of students spread out across the Quad lawn yesterday for the first ever Quadstock, a celebration of "peace and music" inspired by the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair. The event, planned by the Quad House Committees, featured dozens of student performers, including bands and solo artists, who performed throughout the evening in various locations around the grassy lawn. Taking advantage of the warm, sunny weather, all three Quad Houses moved their dinners outside, allowing students to bask in the sunshine and musical vibes.
