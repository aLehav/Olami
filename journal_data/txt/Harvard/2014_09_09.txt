After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Selena, one of the Irish boarding school girls in Tana French’s latest psychological thriller, “The Secret Place,” has a copy of “Alice in Wonderland” by her bed. It’s a minor detail nearly halfway in, of no use to the plot, but it is that special kind of offhand note that reveals the tenor of the whole novel. Most of us survived, never mind how miraculously, the preteen years and their indelible horrors. But reading “The Secret Place” is like living that time all over again: tumbling down a hole into adulthood, awakening to a world terrifically distorted yet recognizable, feeling misunderstood by everyone and desperate to please. This is both the strength and weakness of the book: how entirely it takes the reader from the shores of adulthood back into the troubled waters of a young-adult Wonderland.
In the opening pages, French thrusts the girls and their lives in the reader’s face with relentless energy: “Remember oh remember back when we were, a girl’s voice clear and urgent, the fast light beat lifting you up off your toes and speeding your heart to keep up, and then it’s gone.” This isn’t the usual thriller’s speeding for the sake of speeding. The passage exudes girlish breathlessness, adolescent pangs of anticipation, elusive happiness, and fear of falling behind on the racecourse. Its elusive italicized words are lines from a popular radio song which Holly Mackey—the first student we meet at St. Kilda’s prim, proud, respectable Dublin suburbs school for girls—struggles to grasp and identify. She’s part of a gang of girls that also includes outspoken Julia, shy Becca, and dreamy Selena. They have a rival gang at St. Kilda’s: queen bee Joanne with a backup trio of fake-blond-fake-tan drones in tow. Think “Mean Girls” plus Irish accents, a larger cast of characters, and social media. Plus, one of these eight has committed a murder.
Enter investigators from the Dublin Murder Squad: cautious, smooth-talking Stephen Moran and his leader on the case, beautiful but tough-as-nails Antoinette Conway. The novel alternates between Moran’s chapters, where he narrates his single day of reconnoitring with Conway, and third-person chapters on the girls’ earlier lives. The latter have an edgy undercurrent: they lead up to the night when handsome Chris Harper, from the neighboring boys’ school, was killed with a piece of gardening equipment. When Moran gets a new clue from the school’s student bulletin board, “The Secret Place,” Chris Harper’s case beckons the detectives again.
Nothing is lost on Moran and Conway, and one of the book’s great pleasures is to watch their minds at work. To milk a confession out of Orla, one of Joanne’s toadies and the school’s slowest wit, they improvise the story of an uncooperative former suspect who gets attacked by the ghost of a pet dog he killed: “After the doctors got him cleaned up,” Conway said, “O’Farrell spilled his guts. Full confession. When we took him off in cuffs, he was still screaming, ‘Keep it away from me! Don’t let it get me!’ Grown man, begging like a kid.” They are quite the dynamic duo. Conway, extravagant, twirls and spins off the gory images to a cowed Orla while Moran furtively searches the girl’s bedroom for evidence, now and then modestly adding his own one-two into the mix. Moran’s deadpan brilliance in dialogue as well as narration accounts for some of the novel’s best writing.
The boarding-girl chapters are more unevenly written. French comes too close to the moronic girlspeak that she tries so assiduously to critique, with the result of blah passages. “It’s only half past eight and Julia is bored already,” she writes. “She and the other three are in a tight circle on the dance floor, ignoring the OMG LOL!!! mileage that Joanne’s gang are getting out of Becca’s jeans.” The novel has a lot of these “fake epic period cramps” in its style, making the reader who enjoys French elsewhere want to groan. Studied girlish parlance, understandable on page one, gets old fast when French doesn’t distance herself from it with sufficient irony.
With this drawback, though, French does get far enough inside the girls’ heads to reveal an important truth: the scariest thing isn’t even the act of the murder, or its circumstances, or who did it. It is the school itself. Cruelty, cyber-bullying, betrayal: the well-groomed inhabitants of St. Kilda’s are vicious enough to each other without any murder taking place. Moran soon feels, looking around, that “I couldn’t see any pretty any more, without seeing dangerous underneath. Splinters.” The more Moran and Conway look, the more they realize how adult the dangers lurking in this juvenile place are. In this sense French’s novel is like that other bestseller with a scholastic setting, Donna Tartt’s “The Secret History.”
French’s title also reflects this sense of hidden threats. There is the official “Secret Place,” a hokey hallway board where nothing is actually secret. Then there’s the real secret place, a glade of cypress trees outside the school where the girls celebrate rites of friendship. Poignantly French describes their first night leaving their rooms without permission for the little clearing: they are barely containing their laughter, dancing, running, and feeling over it all that “This has nothing to do with what anyone else in all the world would approve or forbid. This is all their own.” The girls will learn to enjoy this feeling of possession over themselves; each will have her secrets to guard. At the end of the day, “The Secret Place” is most profound when it reveals that the real secret places, the most impenetrable and perilous ones, are those deep inside.

It is difficult for a single review to capture everything that is David Mitchell's “The Bone Clocks.” The novel is by turns family drama, political commentary, cultural history, fantasy epic, and post-apocalyptic vision. It is an elaborate concoction—more than 600 pages crammed full of detail, conflict, complexity, wit, and backstory. No single passage or quote could capture its narrative breadth and linguistic versatility.
“The Bone Clocks” is composed of six novellas, each potentially freestanding yet all closely intertwined. Ranging from the 1980s to the 2040s, from Iceland to Australia, each has a unique voice and its own internal conflicts. Yet, as these conflicts come to a head, others remain unresolved—nagging questions and half-explanations that echo through the life of central protagonist Holly Sykes. Together, the stories weave a riveting tale of Holly's entanglement in a centuries-long conflict between two opposing groups of immortals.
For readers of Mitchell's “Cloud Atlas” or “Number9Dream” this format will certainly ring a bell; multiple interconnected storylines seem to be his go-to narrative device. Yet “The Bone Clocks” proves that it would be a gross disservice to dismiss Mitchell as a one-trick pony. Clearly, he knows what he does well, and the intertwined stories provide him with a vast space to populate with richly developed and complex characters, myriad beautifully-realized settings, and a treasure trove of allusions and linguistic Easter eggs. “The Bone Clocks” takes the nested stories of “Cloud Atlas” and adds a dose of the quintessential English-ness that imbues “Black Swan Green,” another of Mitchell’s novels, then turns down a different track entirely to engage with traditional fantasy tropes. The result is anything but traditional.
Mitchell expertly blends the personal and realistic with the uncanny. Holly's matter-of-fact narrative voice combined with her initial, brilliantly written confusion and uncertainty about what she experiences renders the weird fantasy that intrudes into her life plausible. The initial cynicism of the other narrators, anchored in their own varied and richly realistic plot lines, cements this plausibility. When an immortal finally gives Holly the full account of the magical war raging around her, it seems a bit overdone and cliché: History Channel conspiracy theory meets Tolkienesque war between good and evil. But by this point the questions plaguing Mitchell's narrators have become so intriguing that an explanation is welcome, and the taint of its absurdity is drowned out by the suspense that has led up to it.
In writing his narrators, Mitchell treads a delicate line; each has a distinct voice that is completely authentic while still quirky enough to command attention. There is Holly, the epitome of teenage angst and rebellion, plagued by the mysterious “radio people”; Hugo, a Cambridge scholarship student with dreams of power and influence and a taste for perpetrating fraud; Holly's partner Ed, a “war-junkie” journalist torn between work and family; and Crespin, a novelist past his prime who nurses jealousy and pride amidst a crumbling personal life. Despite their various flaws—arrogance, bigotry, and sociopathic tendencies, to name a few—each commands sympathy, if not affection. Marius, an “atemporal,” as some immortals term themselves, also narrates a section; Mitchell has achieved the impressive feat of fitting centuries of life experience into a believable character. Holly, now in her seventies, returns to narrate the final section. As she reflects on her participation in the atemporals' war, the shifting glimpses of Holly from throughout the novel coalesce into a new voice—older, wiser, different, yet still connected to the teenage Holly.
Mitchell's deft use of language extends beyond the creation of vivid characters, offering many layers of linguistic enjoyment and playfulness. Ed's six-year-old daughter talks of his constant absences, mispronouncing his location: Baghdad becomes “Bad Dad.” Hugo delivers an entirely rhyming drunken soliloquy on his Cambridge peers: “power and money, stick together like Pooh and honey.” The novel is also peppered with literary allusions. Holly, channeling the voice of an immortal who once inhabited the body of an Aboriginal woman, delivers a monologue deeply reminiscent of Toni Morrison's “Beloved.” In a nod to Aldous Huxley's “Brave New World,” Iceland becomes a safe haven in the last chapter's post-apocalyptic landscape. Mitchell also toys with self-reference—Hugo tells Holly a story about buying his younger cousin Jason his first pack of cigarettes, paraphrasing a scene from “Black Swan Green.” In the hands of a less capable writer such references might have come off as effortful and presumptuous, but Mitchell blends them seamlessly into his prose, clever little inside jokes to share with his readers.
Of course, “The Bone Clocks” is not without flaws; the central conflict is a little too clear cut in terms of good and evil, rendering it slightly juvenile. But the nuance that permeates every other aspect of Mitchell's writing, from linguistic creativity, to brilliantly written internal monologues, to compelling and intriguing characters, obscures that insufficiency, creating a work of astonishing depth.

When you think about Harvard, hip-hop isn’t exactly the first thing to come to mind. Sure, perhaps the scholastic springboard for artists such as Leonard Bernstein and Yo-Yo Ma now sponsors a fellowship in honor of Nas. But when it comes to student-generated art, the schedule for Arts First makes one wonder if Harvard’s undergraduates know that people kept making music after the “The Rite of Spring.” Last Friday, an eclectic array of some of Harvard’s student groups set about proving that hip-hop is alive and well at Harvard in an event appropriately dubbed “Harvard Underground.” This initiative to showcase Harvard’s hip-hop scene was led by the Harvard College Rap Collective and also featured performances from the 10.12.60’s, Passus, The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers (THUD), and KeyChange.
The presence of hip-hop groups on campus is remarkably new—the youngest organization of the five, the 10.12.60’s dance crew, was formed just last semester. The Harvard College Rap Collective, founded in the fall of 2012, is not much older. Recalling the formation of the Collective, founding members Martin C. Carlino ’16, Will N. Corbett ’16, and Advik Shreekumar ’16 attribute their origins to a message posted on the Class of 2016’s Facebook page that simply asked if anyone rapped. “We were surprised when we got on campus and no one else was out there asking about rap,” Corbett recalls. “You see the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and other classical music groups out there, but no group was out there saying,‘Anybody rap?’” It took a Facebook message to bring the group together.
Schuyler C. Moore ’15, founder of the 10.12.60’s, shares a similar sentiment: “Honestly, the hip-hop presence on campus is lacking. I think there is space for more, and I hope that the hip-hop scene on campus will keep growing.”
Members of THUD, as well as Passus, Harvard’s only officially recognized step team, also share hopes for the growth of new music at Harvard in the future. “When we’re writing music, we sit in a circle with sticks and just start playing stuff, and the coolest thing that comes out is what winds up the final piece,” says Alex E. Amis ’15, a director emeritus of THUD. “In many ways THUD is a rebellion against the regimen that is classical percussion. The boxes and structures that classical percussion builds, the idea that you have to play this, you have to play it this way, with this technique, on these instruments, is something that we are just really opposed to, and we do everything that we can to break apart that ideology.” Similarly, Passus and the 10.12.60’s choreograph all of their own pieces, and the Collective produces their own raps. “It’s unadulterated,” Shreekumar says with respect to rap. “It’s pure poetry with a beat.”
Before the performance, the Collective expressed the sentiment that the candid and engaging nature of the performances of “Harvard Underground” could perhaps reach out to freshmen in a way other events could not. “People aren’t going to be pulling out their iPhones during the performance,” Carlino explains.“We have more of a chance of getting something across.” Friday night’s performances tried to touch on several topics incoming freshmen might face, ranging from partying to romance, in hopes of ensuring the futures of the organizations involved.
The turnout was small but lively—each performance was met with enthusiastic outbursts and applause. As the show came to a close, students spoke to each other giddily as they emptied Lowell Lecture Hall.  “I didn’t know that Harvard had that sort of variety of different groups,” Rory M. Sullivan ’18 said after the night’s performance. Daphne Thomson ’18 concurred. “I’m glad to know that there is space for that on this campus.” Both girls expressed an interest in engaging with the organizations in the future.
As tryout dates approach, the organizations involved in “Harvard Underground” are still unsure about what the future holds. However, if one thing is for sure, it’s “Harvard Underground” proved that hip-hop is far from a marginal art form on Harvard’s campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all modern post-punk bands, Interpol has maintained the most distinct style. By turns gloomy and ethereal, they blend shoe-staring pedal distortion, driving bass, and hollow vocals that recall Ian Curtis and Morrissey into one of the most recognizable and virtuosic products of the late 1990s and the 2000s. While many other bands in that decade abandoned themselves to a certain mindless cheerfulness, Interpol stood proudly for unapologetic grimness.  Unfortunately, this woefulness was taken to excess on their fourth album, 2010’s self-titled “Interpol,” which was 46 minutes of unremitting misery, unredeemed by technique or content, and widely considered a step down from their earlier work.
In “El Pintor,” their first release after a four-year hiatus, Interpol delivers a well-made comeback album with the band’s old melancholy but also a fresh new vitality. The name “El Pintor” (Spanish: “the painter”) is an anagram of the band’s name, a device that sets the album in deliberate opposition to “Interpol.” Indeed, it is not too much to say that “El Pintor” is an effort to make right the failings of that album, to be a do-over. To achieve this end, the band has fruitfully returned to the style of their earliest work, especially the more fully developed songs of “Turn on the Bright Lights,” which is deliberately invoked by the similarity of the visuals of the album cover.  However, several innovations have been introduced that put “El Pintor” beyond the level of Interpol’s previous albums.
“El Pintor” begins with the engaging “All the Rage Back Home.” While the song maintains the typical ABAB structure of the band’s work, it happily eschews the crushing monotony that afflicted “Interpol,” favoring a quicker tempo and fuller melody than any of the works on that album. In the verses, Paul Banks’s vocals display a warmer tone than is typical of many of Interpol’s compositions. This welcome diversification recalls the crooning style of David Bowie’s Thin White Duke phase and alternates pleasantly with Banks’s standard nasal punk drone.
The album’s second song, “My Desire,” underlines the fact that the band has lost nothing from the departure of bassist Carlos Dengler, as Banks takes on a rhythmically and melodically sophisticated bass line without any apparent difficulty. “My Desire” especially showcases Daniel Kessler’s fine guitar work, which was largely lost on “Interpol.” In this song especially, Interpol seems to have absorbed much influence from the lighter shoe-staring aesthetic.  Indeed, the feel of “My Desire” is strikingly similar to the aural style showcased on the latest album by The War On Drugs, 2014’s “Lost In the Dream,” perhaps indicating a nascent trend towards ethereal guitar riffs and smooth percussion.
The album’s second single, “Ancient Ways,” while not as pleasant for listening as “All the Rage Back Home,” is perhaps the more daring.  Interpol’s typically oblique lyrics give way to a hard-edged opening that would have made Sid Vicious proud—“Ooh, fuck the ancient ways!”  This declaration of frustration gives way to broken images of urban wastelands, train stations, and pavements interpolated with the first line, recalling nothing so much as a perverse, post-industrial versicle and response. While angst is not new ground for Interpol, such directness of presentation is a recent and interesting development.
It may be said that “El Pintor” is a worthy recovery for one of the finest extant proponents of the post-punk aesthetic. Coupled with a robust touring schedule, this release announces that Interpol is back, serious, and full of original and edifying content to come.

Los Angeles-based band OK Go has been making music since 1998.  However, they are probably most renowned for their viral music videos. Over the course of their 17-year career spanning three studio albums, they have released multiple conceptual music videos with millions of views, including their first breakout video for the song “Here It Goes Again.” The electronic-influenced alternative rock band has spent the past summer touring the United States and Canada in anticipation for their new album “Hungry Ghosts” set to be released this October. We had the chance to talk with bassist and vocalist Tim Nordwind about the group’s North American tour and their fourth studio album.
The Harvard Crimson: So, from what I can tell, you guys haven’t toured in a while.
Tim Nordwind: Yeah, we haven’t toured in maybe four years or something like that. We started touring again in July on the west coast, and we’ve done a lot in the Midwest now. And we’ve built a completely new show. It’s a bit more interactive now, a bit more multimedia than it used to be…. We’ve been running an optical illusion during one song that’s sort of thrown onto a kabuki screen that eventually ends up dropping a ton of confetti. There’s a moment in the set when we sample the audience and make a song built off the sampling. We’ve tried to build an emotional arc through our shows, so hopefully there’s what feels like a beginning, middle, and end. It feels really different than what we’ve done in the past. It’s a nice mixture of theater, rock and roll, and technology, all rolled up into one.
THC: You say the show is very different from what it used to be, and I’m curious, where is the change coming from? Is it more along the lines of something that the whole band is going through along with your sound? What’s influencing your decisions around how you guys are structuring your show?
TN: I think the thing that’s driving us to change is the same thing that drives us to make the videos and to make the records. When it seems like there’s opportunities to do things that haven’t been done in the past, we’re generally drawn to those ideas, and it keeps things interesting and fun for us. You see the attempt to make rock shows basically have a crazy light show, but that’s just one of several things that you can do for an hour and a half on stage with an audience. We’re just generally interested in chasing down every other idea that would be fun to watch and fun to do for people onstage. It’s really all in the context of “We’re here to play music,” but we wonder, “Why limit it to just playing music?”
THC: So, to change gears a bit, I wanted to ask you about your upcoming album, “Hungry Ghosts,” which is coming out this October. What’s been different about the recording process this time around?
TN: I think within the last four years...we were demoing a lot while on tour. But the demoing was happening on our computers, so there was a ton of programming going on. It’s just the only way to write these days for us, because we’re just generally not in places where we have a guitar and an amplifier, so we have to program all of this stuff. But this time we were like, “Man, I don’t know if I really want to replace this sound. This thing we’ve programmed here is actually a really interesting sound, and maybe we should just build off of that.” So our record has a much more electric, synthesized sound. A lot of these songs are built from the beat on up, so it’s just a rhythmic and dance-sounding record. And I think one thing I don’t think any of us expected is that a lot of these songs sound like the things we grew up listening to in pop radio during the ’80s. I don’t think it’s a retro-sounding record, but it is a modern take on nostalgia. To me, that actually sets it apart from other records that we’ve made. We’ve fucked with the sonics and the sounds much more than we ever have before.
THC: You guys have a real specific aesthetic going for this album. Have there been any challenges with this? Has it been a tough process, or has it been relatively easy?
TN: It was a remarkably fun challenge. For the first time ever, all four of us had our own programming station. Each of us had our own computer, which we set up in the studio. That was a fun challenge, because someone like Dan [Konopka] has never really gotten in on the songwriting process beyond just playing the drums. But he’s gotten much more into the production these days, so he was really able to lend a hand big-time in programming and writing songs with us for the first time. That was really fun for us. After 15 years of playing and recording together, we’ve managed to find a way to make that process feel fresh and new for us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first of several climaxes in Quentin Tarantino’s 2012 epic “Django Unchained” is a lengthy negotiation around plantation owner Calvin Candie’s dinner table. The titular Django, a runaway slave, and his German friend, the traveling dentist Dr. King Schultz, engage in a tense attempt to buy Django’s wife back from Candie. As the meal progresses, the plantation owner becomes increasingly suspicious of the duo’s motives.
While devoid of the frenetic movement and violence for which Tarantino is known, the scene is still remarkably detailed. Slaves bring each course to the table in a meticulously choreographed routine while Tarantino’s camera hones in on each character’s handling of their silverware and napkins. The scene is just as focused on the culture and intricacies of Southern life as it is on the individuals; the auteur clearly thought through every detail and historical flourish. Tarantino wrote the film in addition to directing it, but he did not approach the project just happening to have a firm grasp on the aesthetics of the late antebellum period. That’s why the guidance of John Stauffer, a professor of English and American Literature and African American studies at Harvard, was so important.
Stauffer is just one among a bevy of Harvard humanities professors who have worked as historical consultants for feature films. He’s an actor in a scholarly exchange that takes place during the production of virtually every narrative historical movie. Despite the ubiquity of consulting, though, there is no consistent formula for how the historical consultant is approached or what they do for the director and creative team. What’s more, the interaction isn’t something that many professors are eager to discuss, either out of prior agreement or lack of passion about the projects on which they worked.
Those who are willing to talk, though, reveal a world of nuanced intellectual discourse with the writers and directors who solicit their help. The sincere desire evinced on both ends to present a compelling and artistically free vision of the past is the only constant in the otherwise case-by-case world of academic film consulting.
GETTING THE PICTURE
I expected the central tension in this piece to be the push and pull between the factual vision of the past that historians present and the fantastical realm of the filmmaker. I was ready to tell stories of fights between directors who wanted to change the location of Gettysburg and scholars who felt an ideological obligation to stop them. Minutes into my conversation with Stauffer, however, I realized that this was not at all the dynamic.
Stauffer rejects the notion that a history professor consulting on a film should act as fact-checker. “A scholar can’t expect for a film to be historically accurate—it’s a separate genre,” he says. Rather than chase large-scale accuracy, Stauffer focuses on making the filmmaker’s images and scenes as detailed and evocative of the era in question as possible.
According to the professors interviewed for this article, the path to becoming a consultant on a film varies on a case-by-case basis. In the case of “Django Unchained,” Tarantino’s producer contacted Stauffer and told him that the crew needed help. “My role was to read the script, assess it for authenticity, and mainly give them descriptions to help with their images,” Stauffer says. Many of those descriptions went toward furnishing the details for the elaborate dinner scene.
“Tarantino asked me, ‘What kind of food would they serve? How many slaves would be serving the dinner? How would they dress? What’s the table setting like?’” Rather than give Tarantino direct answers, Stauffer provided the director with literature that offered him a number of options. “There are contemporaneous books about what table settings were like at that time, so I led him to the literature,” Stauffer explains.
The professor’s methods fit into his philosophy about the malleability of representation.  Stauffer says his flexibility is just as much based on audience expectation as it is on ceding creative control to the director. “A lot of scholars are upset––they assume that a film can somehow perfectly mimic a historical narrative, which is absurd,” Stauffer says. “You can’t bog down a film with too much context…. Hollywood screenwriters are writing for an eighth grade readership.” While other director-consultant teams might espouse different philosophies, Stauffer and Tarantino believe that the most effective way to relay history to the masses in a film is through the detail and sumptuousness of its visual presentation as opposed to the exactitude of its script.
ROSENSTONE’S RULE
The work of cultural theorist Robert Rosenstone played a significant role in making Stauffer comfortable with stylized history films. In his essay 1995 “The Historical Film as Real History,” Rosenstone argues that the historiography, or critical examination of history, presented in a film almost always mirrors that which exists in the academic community.
Django is no exception—the film suggests that the evil of slavery necessitated the violent response that ultimately sparked the Civil War. “Virtually every scholar will say that the essential cause of the conflict was slavery,” Stauffer says. “Yet today, two-thirds of white Southerners still thinks that slavery was incidental, almost irrelevant, in the case of the Civil War.” In Stauffer’s mind, films provide a means of introducing historiographical realities to populations that are still digesting stale concepts.
As long as films mesh with the prevailing historiography, Stauffer argues, they can serve as vehicles for the spread of scholarly analysis. “A history film is the greatest source of evangelism for the works of history used to construct it,” he says.
The exceptions to Rosenstone’s rule, which arise when filmmakers avoid prevailing literature on their subject, cause a major problem for Stauffer. The historian cites “Gettysburg,” a six-hour long 1993 film about the Civil War battle, as egregiously sympathetic to the cause of the South. “There are still relatively recent films that I would call neo-Confederate,” he says. While most films do reflect prevailing historical narratives, Stauffer is careful to keep his eyes open for potentially dangerous portrayals of bygone times.
Eric Rentschler, a Germanic Languages and Literatures professor and another Tarantino consultant, takes Stauffer’s message of factual leniency a step further. Rentschler says he believes that films that present counterfactual representations of the past can be just as valuable as those that try to reflect history exactly.
Rentschler worked with Tarantino on “Inglorious Basterds,” a film set late in World War II that culminates in the slaughter an entire cadre of Nazi leaders by a troop of Jewish-American soldiers. The GIs takes out Hitler and company in a bloody barrage of machine gun bullets during a night at the movies while the Nazi aristocracy around them burns in a simultaneous fire. “The film takes out Hitler in the most brutal, savage, and merciless way, not granting him a final shot or any last words,” Rentschler says. “The film is trying to dispel the fascination of fascism, and in that regard is doing something fundamentally different from what all the other Nazi retro films have done.”
A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR
Like Stauffer, Rentschler follows Rosenstone’s historiographical thinking. But while Stauffer seems entirely on board with Tarantino’s subversion of the past, Rentschler is critical of certain aspects of the director’s handling of his source material. Rentschler’s tome “The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and its Afterlife” is the principal book that Tarantino utilized to create his narrative about propaganda minister Joseph Goebbel’s films and to create a pastiche of a Nazi film, which the party’s leaders are watching when they are killed.
For the most part, Rentschler lauds Tarantino’s usage of the book. “I think he learned some things factually, particularly that Goebbels wasn’t purely an ideologue and was in some ways a huge cinephile who looked to Hollywood,” Rentschler says. When it came to creating his imagined Nazi film, however, Tarantino opted more for an exaggeratory tone. “The point in my book is that the films that don’t seem full of poison are those which are most ideologically insidious––the notion of ‘the spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down,’” says Rentschler.
The bluntly violent and anti-semitic film-within-a-film that Tarantino created, then, is less subtle and affecting than the films that were actually being released. “[The film-within-a-film] is very obvious, very heavy-handed, and very ideological,” says Rentschler. “It’s actually not the kind of film that Goebbels would have made.”
Still, despite his complaint, Rentschler appreciates Tarantino and says he has even internalized a friend’s conspiracy theory about “Inglorious Basterds: “[My friend] said, ‘It’s curious that the Michael Fassbender character in the film is...a specialist in Nazi cinema who has also written a book on director G.W. Pabst.’ If I really wanted to flatter myself I could assume that it was some sort of inscription of my presence, but I’m not willing to go that far.”
STYLE WATCH
University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. builds on Stauffer and Rentschler’s concept of historiographical truth to condemn any scholars who look to censor artistic voices. “I want artists, black and white, to have full creative license in their interpretation of black history and black reality—that’s the only way we can get at its complex truth,” he says. “‘Django’ is just as true to the black experience as ‘12 Years a Slave.’” Gates, who consulted on the latter film while engaging Tarantino in a widely read interview series about “Django Unchained,” believes that stylizing African-American history is the only way to keep the public engaged with its lessons. “It would be boring if the only way to represent the black experience would be through a one-to-one relationship with history.”
With “12 Years a Slave,” however, Gates did his best to honor the narrative that Solomon Northup provided in his own written account of his kidnapping by con men and the sufferings he endured at the hand of mercurial cotton planter Edwin Epps. “When you have an autobiography, the criteria are different,” Gates says. After a long phone conversation with Steve McQueen, the film’s director, Gates agreed to look over the script and help make McQueen’s representation of Northup’s life as accurate as possible.
Gates says that he directed particular effort toward trying to uncover the fate of Northup after his emancipation. To this day, Northup’s unsuccessful prosecution of his kidnappers and the circumstances of his death 10 years after his freeing are shrouded in mystery. “I did a lot of research to get the state-of-the-art scholarship about Northup’s last years and wrote the final words on the screen at the end of the film, which they used verbatim. I was very flattered by that,” says Gates. For Gates and McQueen, free communication seems to have led directly into mutual admiration and effective collaboration.
A TRUE COLLABORATION
While Stauffer and Rentschler had mostly positive interaction with Tarantino, neither has kept up communication with the director or ever actually met him––Stauffer even declined an invitation to go to the set, citing his disillusioned feelings toward celebrity and Hollywood. Gates and McQueen are a different story. “Steve McQueen has always been a hero of mine…. I know many of the black intellectuals on the English scene,” Gates says. “I’d never met him before, so the initial phone call was very exciting.”
In addition to attending the premiere of the film at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, where he discussed the film with the cast and crew at length, Gates has kept up communication with McQueen and plans on honoring him with the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal, presented to luminaries who work for African-American rights and visibility, at the second annual Hutchins Center Honors on Sept. 30. The closeness and mutual admiration that have developed between the duo showcase more clearly than anything else I encountered the potential for scholars and filmmakers to work in tandem. Far from engaging in a historiographic tug-of-war, McQueen and Gates seem to be working in parallel.
BIG BUSINESS
The primary concerns of scholars and filmmakers during the consultation process are the placement of appropriate historical details and the necessity of appealing to a broad audience. However, the opinions of a third party also figure into the equation. David Franzoni, writer of “Amistad” and “Gladiator,” thinks that film executives play just as large of a role as scholars in determining the vision of the past that a film presents. Franzoni, who worked with Classics professor Kathleen M. Coleman on “Gladiator” and several other projects, believes that the roles of scholars and executives on films are diametrically opposed.
The way Franzoni sees it, scholars like Coleman push his scripts, which initially value emotional relatability just as much as accuracy, toward the subtle truths of the times he explores. “I want to create my drama,” Franzoni says. “I do a lot of research beforehand so it’s never going to be completely wacko, but then if an advisor wants to show me where I’ve gone wrong, that’s great.”
Franzoni’s opinion of the studio system is less favorable. According to Franzoni, studio representatives often attempt to pigeonhole his scripts into pre-established archetypes, going so far as to rewrite them in ways that eliminate any semblance of historiographical relevance. “With ‘Gladiator,’ the studios assumed the genre––what they imagined to be guys in skirts with swords and sandals––was dead,” Franzoni says. “If they weren’t going to make it into a Clint Eastwood revenge movie, which it was not, then what was it?”
NEW FRONTIERS
For the moment, due largely to what Franzoni sees as the anti-intellectualizing forces of Hollywood, he’s focused his efforts on television. The writer is currently working on a mini-series with Steven Spielberg about the 17th-century wars between the Algonquin and Iroquois Native Americans, along with four other projects. “The writer calls the shots, which is why television has not only survived, but is flourishing,” Franzoni says.
One of Franzoni’s film-writing heir apparents, who is a former student of Coleman, Elizabeth C. Adams ’10, also has her finger on the pulse of the small screen. She has penned a screenplay based on the life of Arminius, a Germanic general who defeated a Roman battalion in 4 C.E., and is now looking to television as her preferred platform. “Last year I was 100 percent about film...but right now, television is the place for groundbreaking and intellectual stuff,” Adams says.
It remains to be seen whether television can provide an escape from the corporate forces that undermine scholarship on the big screen. But regardless of what the future holds for television, it is clear to Adams that the delicate balance between cultural accessibility and historical accuracy that underlies historical films will not go away with the rising generation of filmmakers.
“I often struggle with ideas like, ‘Maybe I should change a name to make it more accessible, or take a part out that makes the script too unwieldy,’” Adams says, adding that knowing how contemporary to make her characters’ speech patterns is another source of confusion. It’s no surprise, then, that she has a desire for scholarly guidance, and is still in contact with her mentor, Coleman. While the world of academic film consulting is just as theory-heavy and tangled as the history it attempts to make sense of, those who work in the field believe that it is an indispensable process in the filmmaker’s journey from word to screen.

“I like that a photograph alludes to something and doesn’t really fully tell the story,” says David Hilliard, a visiting artist at the Carpenter Center this year. For Hilliard, who has backgrounds in theater and film, photography has a “magic” related to but unique from that of cinema and stage. His paneled photographs, which show glimpses of human scenes in progress, feel like a spectacle unfolding at the viewer’s pace. Hilliard sat down with the Crimson to talk about his work, which will be on display at the Carpenter Center through September 28.
The Harvard Crimson:  How long does it take for you to set up the photographs?
David Hilliard: There’s no recipe. Some are preconceived: I have an idea and I build or find a location and I make the photograph, and sometimes it’s the recreation of a moment or an illustration of an idea. And other times, like if I had time right now and I were with you and I had my camera, it’s the newness of somebody in nice light…. The photographs are rectangular. They’re not panoramic; I’m not cutting up a negative. So when you see a photograph, that’s three pieces.
THC: You’re actually shooting separate pieces.
DH: Because they are actually separate moments, with shifting time, with shifting focus. The way the written word, storytelling, works: language. The way a cinematic camera works: je-je-je-je-jer. And so all of that is not about formally breaking them up…. Sometimes I’ll give a lecture on my work and someone will say, why are you cutting up your negatives? I’m like, no, they’re like separate moments. Your day, our day, are separate moments of time, that if laid out, would look like that: boomboomboomboom. So it’s about finding these moments, and acknowledging them, and editing them down to the best moments.
THC: But it’s also that [in your work], even while each moment can exist on its own, the moments are all residues of each other; each is visible in the others.
DH: Right. I do think of each one as its own moment, but they are all touching upon each other. Each moment in my life and yours is rubbing shoulders with the previous one and the next. And that’s what’s happening in my work…. Moments rubbing up against other moments. Really sensual, if you think about it—life and art.
THC: You do frequently expose the human body, but it’s not a sensuality that’s comfortable with itself.
DH: Right, and there’s a kind of quiet, a discomfort, and a celebration at the same time…. It’s part of our lives, and we don’t always talk about it.
THC: Are you interested in the fact that we don’t talk about it?
DH: Yeah, sure. And in especially my case—in my political statement as a gay man, it isn’t important that my work always be about that—but it is important that the audience knows that these images were made by the lenses of a gay man…. My work is about intimate relationships: the ones that I share, the ones that a heterosexual might share, the ones that a different culture might share…. I am very interested in the nuances of maleness…. And also being lower middle class. Growing up in New England and growing up poor. So there’s a lot of biography, [a] lot of autobiography in the work.
THC: To what degree do you put yourself in the photos?
DH: There was a time when, I think as a young artist I felt that if my work were about me, I had to be in all of the pictures. [But] I realized, and it was so obvious, that the work was always about me. And it was easier to step out of the frame and find other people; there were surrogates for myself, or other people who are more like me, or unlike me. So the [photographs] became more about me once I stopped being in them…. I still occasionally seep into some of my work, but with more forethought about why I need to be there.
THC: You were talking about how there’s different kinds of intimacy between people in your work. Is there a kind of intimacy that they have with the environment? The environment figures in your work very prominently; there’ll be entire panels with no people.
DH: I am interested in environmental portraiture. How does our environment act on your subject, your sitter, in the photograph? And vice versa. What does your sitter bring to the environment? So there’s this dialogue that goes on when we look at photographs. It matters where somebody is in the picture. I like to question that. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn’t. There can be irony; this person really doesn’t belong in that setting, and it does change, switch up the read of the photograph.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Tuesday is study card day. It is also primary election day in Massachusetts. I am writing to urge members of the Harvard community to vote on Tuesday, even amid the craze of the new academic year. Information about the candidates is easily accessible online, and voting is one of those democratic practices that we simply must not neglect.
I would also like to draw readers’ attention to an important gubernatorial candidate who deserves a close look: Dr. Donald M. Berwick ’68. I am not affiliated with Berwick’s campaign and I am not much of a political activist myself. But I have been deeply impressed by what the Boston Globe called Dr. Berwick's “principled contrast to politics as usual.” A pediatrician and medical executive who led Medicare for a year under President Obama, Berwick is a candidate with bold ideas and the experience and independence to bring them to fruition.
Dr. Berwick has proposed a single-payer health care system for Massachusetts—a desperately needed reform that would eliminate waste and improve access to quality care for everyone, regardless of ability to pay.
He is also the only candidate to oppose the state’s tragic embrace of casino gambling. (Berwick supports repealing the casino law by ballot question this November.) As he rightly emphasizes, casinos that prey on the poor are not only unethical in principle: They are also disastrous in practice. Gambling cannot sustainably raise public revenue or create the kind of job growth that we need.
Finally, Berwick has made the fight against poverty and economic injustice the center of his campaign, while his opponents have been almost silent about this most fundamental of issues. His stances on health care and casinos are just two parts of a serious and ambitious plan to root out the scandalous, unnecessary poverty that so many Massachusetts residents are suffering.
Berwick is one Harvard alumnus who deserves a very close look—and ultimately our votes. He has the experience, independence, and vision that are so urgently needed to tackle the problems that matter most. Please consider supporting Dr. Berwick today.
The election's outcome is in our hands, and the moral stakes are high.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It all started last summer. After I read “Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women” by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, my reply to the common icebreaker question, “What's your dream job?” shifted from my jokingly witty “professional Italian food taste tester” response to a new career ambition: investigative international journalist.
After reading “Half the Sky,” I emerged with an admiration for WuDunn and Kristof as groundbreaking journalists. They had an engaging ability to tell not only their own personal reactions to their experiences, but also the stories and testimonies of others—of women whose voices and experiences had been silenced by lack of international attention or care. And the issues—subjects as complex and dangerous as prostitution, human trafficking, and female genital mutilation—they tackled rarely appeared in news headlines. I realized that perhaps the most effective and respectful way to initiate change against such injustices is to expose the multiple dimensions of each story through the power of storytelling.
But lately, I’ve begun to feel that my aspiration to be an investigative journalist is more likely a dream than a possible reality—no matter my teenage idealism and optimism. And that’s because I’m a woman.
Don't get me wrong. There are plenty of brave female investigative journalists I admire. Christiane Amanpour has traveled to report on the most dangerous and unpredictable events in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Melinda Henneberger anchors one of my favorite news sources on the Washington Post called “She the People.” And Katie Couric has brought international attention to the BP Oil Spill, 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and 2010 Haiti earthquake.
Still, there is something highly discouraging about the lack of women in the journalism industry: There are fewer than 25 women journalists in New York University’s 2012 list of “The 100 Outstanding Journalists in the United States in the Last 100 Years” and Washingtonian’s “Top 50 Journalists of 2009.”
In March 2013, an article in the Columbia Journalism Review articulated the need for more women in investigative journalism. It spoke of common fears and barriers that many aspiring female journalists like me face, including the fear of sexual assault, susceptibility to subordinate gender norms, and lack of mentorship and guidance.
These worries are real. The average woman is not as strong as the average man, leaving women inherently more vulnerable to physical harm—the journalism industry fails to accommodate this truth. By failing to provide adequate protection for female journalists, especially when they’re covering stories in dangerous sites abroad, news outlets discourage women from participating. Amanpour said in an interview with MAKERS that, particularly in areas that lack media exposure, subordination, exploitation, and abuse of women run rampant. These attitudes make it difficult for female journalists to access sites that can produce valuable and meaningful stories.
These struggles have convinced me that, if I choose to pursue journalism, I will meet more structural and societal barriers. This sad reality makes me wonder whether, rather than getting out in the field myself, I will be forced to admire the work of current female investigative journalists from my computer screen.
But then, I snap out of it. I realize that, despite the limitations, I still aspire. I yearn to use writing and news media as a platform for my thoughts and opinions. My greatest motivation to become an investigative journalist is rooted in my hopes to provide my perspective—a female perspective—in news coverage, story selection, and government policy.
In an industry that has so often been viewed through a male lens, maybe all it takes is the involvement of more women in order to ignite changes in the industry and provide more adequate protection for female journalists. Maybe all it takes is an acknowledgement of a difficult reality and an unwavering persistence to passionately pursue a career that has been attained by few, yet aspired by so many. Maybe the solution is simple: me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s often said that Americans like policies offered by Democrats and principles offered by Republicans. While that’s certainly a gross generalization, it is, more often than not, true.
Talk about Obamacare, for instance, and most Americans come down hard against the program. But talk about specific provisions—such as “subsidy assistance to individuals” or “Medicaid expansion”—and most are all for it.
Mention increased gun control and Americans are ambivalent. But ask about “increased background checks” and they’re ardent supporters. Ask if the government should cut spending across the board, and three-quarters say “yes.” But talk about cutting back specific programs like social security and…well, you get the idea.
“When Americans look at the woods, they’re Republicans,” writes Dominic Tierney, a political science professor at Swarthmore. “When they look at the trees, they’re Democrats.”
As of late, this dynamic has put President Obama into a public relations bind when it comes to foreign policy—an impossible Catch-22 in which Americans strongly disapprove of the manner in which he deals with events abroad, while at the same time approving of almost every specific action and inaction he takes.
In terms of the “woods,” as Tierney phrases it, 55 percent of Americans now disapprove of the president’s performance on foreign policy, and 54 percent say he hasn’t been “tough” enough. Country by country, Americans disapprove of the way he’s handled Iran, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, and Ukraine.
In terms of the trees, however, they wholeheartedly approve of the almost all of the specific policies he’s actually applied to those hotspots.
Take the example of Syria, for starters: When President Bashar al-Assad crossed the so-called “red line” by using chemical weapons on his own people this time last year, war-weary Americans remained firmly against airstrikes or military engagement of any kind. Obama kept out, and—while using a strategy that neoconservatives like to condemn as hopelessly quixotic—managed to diplomatically divest Assad of chemical weapons. Now, in the unlikely case that Sunni extremists take control of any of the dictator’s weapons arsenals, Americans, as well as Shiites, Jews, and Christians across the Middle East, have decidedly less to fear.
In terms of the Islamic State, or IS, Americans support airstrikes against the group in Iraq and strongly condemn the idea of committing ground troops to the situation. Again, Obama’s actions have followed the preferences of the public, allowing the Kurds and the government in Baghdad regain a foothold after the initial Islamist onslaught without a single American life lost.
In Afghanistan, the vast majority of Americans support Obama’s withdrawal timeline. In Ukraine, 17 percent think the US government has, in fact, done too much to counter Russian aggression.
And in Iran—where Americans apparently think Obama is milquetoast, yet have always opposed a military strike themselves—sanctions coordinated by the administration played a large role in sweeping the relatively moderate Hassan Rouhani into the presidency, where he has surrounded himself with Western-educated advisors, many toting American Ph.D.’s.
“The recent presidential election in Iran proved that the Islamic Republic’s instinct for self-preservation trumps its ideology,” wrote Medhi Khalaji, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, in the Washington Post last year.
So, why does this dissonance between the approval of Obama’s specific policies and the disapproval of his grander “foreign policy” matter?
Because, simply put, the manner in which America’s military engages with the world is at a crossroads. After two unsuccessful wars in the Middle East that cost Americans $4 to 6 trillion and at least 6,690 military lives not including post-combat suicides, we lost our appetite for foreign conflict and realized the futility of attempting to culturally transform an entire region with brute force.
As recently as mid-2013, the majority of Americans still thought the country did “too much” in “solving the world’s problems.” As late as this June, The American Prospect, a liberal magazine, and the American Conservative, an old-school right-of-center publication, went so far as to jointly proclaim a “new consensus” of “prudence, the rule of law, and diplomacy.”
When it gets down to the nitty-gritty—the actual nuts and bolts of foreign policy—the American public still wholeheartedly embraces this “new consensus.” But in terms of the greater woods, a new hawkishness has begun to creep in, and it’s creeping in at Obama’s expense.
The danger is that if this public hawkishness continues to grow, neocons—“tough” guys, so to speak, in the mold of John McCain or Lindsay Graham—could very well rule the White House and Foggy Bottom.
When that happens, our foreign policy will be transformed. But to the chagrin of the public, so too will those limited, precise, on-the-ground policies that we have come to prefer and, apparently, take for granted.

Last week’s announcement by the University of its decision to alter the structure of its healthcare plans for non-union employees is a perplexing one.  The new plan offers some benefits: lowering premiums, decreasing the annual out-of-pocket maximum, and improving dental coverage. But the biggest change is the introduction of coinsurance, meaning that employees will now have to pay all or a portion of the cost of many non-preventive procedures that the old plan fully covered. Citing a need to “curb cost growth” and “to improve our incentives to become better consumers of healthcare,” the University argues that these changes are necessary to “avoid more significant changes […] in the longer term.”
Bill Jaeger, the director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, reacted negatively to the changes, noting that though his members “are not yet directly affected,” he expects “the University to negotiate about the possibility of their application to our members.” He also argues that the alterations were “a short-term step in the wrong direction.” This tension between Harvard and its employees illustrates a fundamental flaw in the U.S. healthcare system’s reliance on employment-based insurance.
The United States is alone among industrialized countries in the extent to which it ties health insurance to a person’s condition of employment: 55.1 percent of Americans relied on employment-based insurance in 2011. This practice has numerous drawbacks, including “job-lock,” or the reluctance of employees to leave jobs with good benefits, and the difficulty of having a balkanized market of businesses negotiate effectively with insurance companies. Employees, too, lack the information or incentives to minimize the cost of their care.
Most relevant to Harvard, employment-based health insurance creates friction between employer and employee. The University is right that its previous plan was generous; the new iteration is closer to “national norms.” Jaeger, conversely, is right that cost-sharing measures like the ones introduced often harm poorer and sicker workers, though reimbursements for lower-income employees will counteract this effect. Studies cited in Harvard Magazine’s piece on the employee health changes also show that cost sharing does not necessarily reduce overall spending.
Harvard is hardly at risk of going bankrupt because of its healthcare costs, but removing the issue of health benefits from the University’s sometimes tense negotiations with unions like HUCTW would undoubtedly improve mutual relations.
Recent changes to the U.S. healthcare system–most notably the introduction of a more robust individual insurance market with subsidies–may be the beginnings of a shift in how Americans obtain insurance, but the system is still too wedded to employment-based coverage. In the short term, we hope that the University finds cost-saving efficiencies that do not substantially burden employees or interfere with their access to necessary care. In the long term, however, systemic change in U.S. health policy will be necessary to avoid the kind of situation in which Harvard now finds itself.

UPDATED: September 9, 2014, at 12:25 a.m.
Voters head to the polls on Tuesday for a long slate of primaries in Massachusetts.
At the top of the ballot are the Republican and Democratic gubernatorial primaries. Two state political veterans, Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 and Democrat Martha M. Coakley, have separated themselves from their respective competition. Incumbent Democrat Deval L. Patrick ’78 is not seeking a third term.
Baker, who has distanced himself from his years at Harvard College and said he attended “because of the brand,” is back for another run after losing to Patrick in 2010 by a 6.4 percent margin. In the private sector, Baker spent ten years as the CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, which began as a Harvard-sponsored health plan and still provides some coverage to University employees. Baker served in cabinet posts under two Republican governors in the 1990s, William F. Weld ’66 and Paul Cellucci.
Baker has staked out stances on a number of hot social issues that are atypical of the national Republican platform, voicing support for abortion rights as well as same-sex marriage. He has been the consensus nominee since he entered the race.
Coakley, the state’s attorney general and Baker’s likely opponent in November, is best known for a difficult loss to moderate Republican Scott Brown in a heated U.S. Senate race in 2010. While Brown became the flag bearer of the Republican takeover of the Senate that year, many state Democrats expressed disappointment in the way Coakley ran her campaign.
Coakley has faced vocal challenges from Steven Grossman and Donald M. Berwick ’68, but polls show her well ahead. Brown, her opponent from 2010, has moved to New Hampshire and will likely challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in the general election. Polls show Shaheen with a narrow lead in a race that, as is typical with Brown, has generated significant national interest.
Harvard voters who live on campus will be able to approve of or reject numerous members of their legislative delegations at the federal and state levels. Sen. Edward J. Markey is running unopposed, but U.S. Rep. Katherine M. Clark of the Fifth Congressional District has a challenger, as does State Rep. Marjorie C. Decker of the Twenty-Fifth Middlesex District.
Voters will also choose from a slate of candidates vying for lieutenant governor. Leland Cheung may be familiar to Harvard voters: he is a longtime Cambridge city councillor who has brought his campaign to Harvard Yard in support of the Divest Harvard movement. A Democrat, Cheung faces Stephen Kerrigan, a former staffer for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, and Michael Lake, who works in economic development.
One of Tuesday’s closest primaries is the Democratic race for attorney general nominee, the office which Coakley is relinquishing after serving in since 2007. Maura T. Healey ’92, a lawyer who played basketball at Harvard and is considered a political newcomer, has closed the gap between herself and former State Senator Warren E. Tolman. A recent Boston Globe poll showed Healey with a healthy lead. According to The Advocate, Healey, who is a lesbian, would be the first openly gay attorney general in the country.
Secretary of State William F. Galvin has predicted a low turnout of between 15 and 20 percent of eligible voters, according to the Boston Globe.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 9, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the political party of incumbent New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, as well as when she is expected to face off against Republican Scott Brown. In fact, Shaheen is a Democrat and is expected to run against Brown in Novemeber's general election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed preservation of the Silver Maple Forest and allocated a $27,000 donation from the Helen and William Mazer Foundation to purchase a bicycle counter interface at its Monday meeting.
The meeting, which took place inside the Attles Meeting Room at Cambridge Rindge and Latin Public School, also included the confirmation of Paula Crane as Cambridge’s deputy city clerk and a discussion of the appropropriate level of fluoridation in Cambridge’s water supply. Leland Cheung, a city councillor currently running for state lieutenant governor, was the lone absence at the meeting.
The bicycle counter, an interface that will display the number of cyclists and pedestrians that have passed by a certain location that day or that year, would further the City of Cambridge’s efforts to support bicycling, according to Iram Farooq, a member of the Cambridge community development department. The counter will be placed on a highly frequented street, she said during the meeting, suggesting Mass. Ave. as a potential location.
For Cambridge City Councillor Craig A. Kelley, who said he strongly supports bicycling, the measure is a step—not the finish line—in Cambridge’s pursuit of a truly bicycle-friendly city.
"If we are going to say bicycling is an answer to the congestion again and again and again, then we have to put serious meat behind this," Kelley said, adding that "one [bicycle counter] isn't enough."
The council spent a significant amount of time discussing the possibility of purchasing a large portion of the Silver Maple Forest, which includes portions of Cambridge, Arlington, and Belmont, in order to further protect Cambridge’s watershed. However, Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi said that because much of the land is located outside of Cambridge, he was unsure of whether Cambridge could purchase it.
Speculating that purchasing the land would be a “long, drawn out, very convoluted process," Rossi added that, "Whether we wanted to buy it or not, it's not for sale."
City Councillor Marc C. McGovern noted that all of the forest within Cambridge borders has already been put under protection, and that Cambridge has done its part. Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan said that although he is concerned about climate change, he is also concerned that preservation may negatively affect local residents.
“We need to look into our commitment to affordable housing and prioritize residents,” Benzan said.
The meeting’s agenda included a list of applications, such as a request from Mike’s Pastries to put out a hanging sign at their planned Harvard Square property at 11 Dunster St. The Department of Public Works approved the application.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the College prepares to radically change the way it adjudicates cheating cases, the committee that first proposed the reform is gearing up to choose and train members of a student-faculty judicial body that will address academic dishonesty.
The Academic Integrity Committee advanced a proposal for the College’s first honor code this spring, over a year after Harvard adjudicated its largest cheating scandal in recent memory. The proposal, which was approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in May, calls for the creation of a student-faculty judicial body, distinct from the Administrative Board, to hear cases of academic dishonesty.
The honor code, and the judicial board it will create, are scheduled to go into effect next fall. Brett Flehinger, interim secretary of the Ad Board, said that the nomination process for positions on the body—which administrators are now calling an “honor council” instead of an “honor board”—will launch before the end of this semester.
Flehinger, who sits on the Academic Integrity Committee, said he expects that some House and resident deans will be members of the honor council. The deans currently serve on the Ad Board.
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean of Ivy Yard and also an Academic Integrity Committee member, said the committee will focus this year on developing procedures for the honor council and determining how students will be chosen to serve on it.
The committee is also tasked with finalizing details about the statement students will sign to affirm their commitment to the honor code, as well as considering what disciplinary sanctions the honor council will hand down, according to Ranen.
“There’s a lot to do this year,” he said.
Those selected to serve on the council will go through a rigorous training process, which Flehinger said the Academic Integrity Committee will soon develop.
“The logic has always been that training has to be robust...and intensive,” Flehinger said.
Acknowledging that serving on the honor council will be a “major commitment,” Ranen said that the Academic Integrity Committee may face some challenges as it begins to recruit students for the council.
“Getting students who really care about it and trying to identify those students is not easy,” Ranen said. “We’re trying to identify those students who find this interesting work and want to be a part of the conversation.”
Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a student representative on the Academic Integrity Committee, said the group tentatively plans to reach out to students through postering and email. The UC is also planning to publicize the honor council to students.
“We hope students will be excited about it, but also take the idea of an honor [council] really seriously,” Goffard said.
The Academic Integrity Committee’s first meeting of the semester is scheduled for Sept. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a nearly filled Science Center C, the first lecture of the Science and Cooking series began without the spoke-emitting, fire-alarm-triggering bang that kicked off the talks last fall. The annual series, in which world-renowned chefs describe the science behind their work to the public, entered its fifth season with chefs Dave Arnold of the radio show “Cooking Issues” and Harold McGee, author of the New York Times column “The Curious Cook.”
Applied mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner, who instructs Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,” the course affiliated with the lectures, began the talk by commenting that he initially did not expect the program to be so successful.
“No one here is more surprised that we’re still going today,” he said.
Brenner said he thinks the lectures are popular because televised cooking shows have increased the public’s awareness of food.
According to Dawn M. Miller, who coordinates the lecture series, there are no plans to accommodate an increasing audience turnout, even though a significant number of audience members were turned away last year. Declining to provide a specific figure, she said that the lectures are very expensive and that most of the money goes toward speakers’ airfare and lodging.
Brenner began the first lecture of the semester by presenting the syllabus of SPU 27, which contained topics such as “The Science of Sugar” and “Viscosity of Soups and Sauces.”
“You can take these recipes that everyone’s really interested in and you can ruin them,” Brenner said jokingly in reference to a lab in which students analyze chocolate lava cake.
Unlike previous lectures, Monday’s talk conspicuously lacked live demonstrations of new culinary techniques.
McGee said that he and Arnold decided the demos were unnecessary, and that they had instead decided to present a history of scientific cooking over the past 20 years.
“Why did we end up thinking that we had to put on a spectacular show all the time?” McGee asked.
The two chefs also described a three-day course that they taught together, in which they walked students through their thought process in inventing new foods.
“For me the point of teaching science of cooking is it’s everybody’s job to ask questions,” Brenner said. “I actually care much less about whether somebody learns what pH is, but whether somebody learns to ask the question, ‘Why is it that orange juice is less sour than lemon juice?’”
Brenner expressed optimism that culinary scientific advances could improve lives.
Quoting Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the late nineteenth century French gastronomist, Brenner said, “the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing last season with a disappointing 8-9 record, marking the program’s ninth straight losing season, the Harvard field hockey team (2-0) is ready to deliver on some high expectations.
The Crimson certainly won’t be lacking in young talent, as freshman Hannah Wellington burst onto the scene in her first weekend of collegiate play to score two goals in the team’s decisive 4-0 win over Holy Cross.
“[This season] we want to focus on keeping the field wide,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “We want to keep it open, and Hannah was able to be right there in the right spot and get the two goals. She’s been a good player in the past, she was captain of her high school team for a long time, and I think we saw a bright future for her here.”
Coming off of a 3-2 win over Bryant on Friday, Harvard jumped out to an early lead on Sunday against Holy Cross, as senior Kaitlyn Boudah knocked home a goal after receiving a feed from co-captain Caitlin Rea.
Wellington quickly added to the Crimson’s lead with her first goal of the day, collecting the ball at the top of the circle off of some quick passes by sophomores Sarah Finnemore and Kyla Cordrey and firing it in to give Harvard a 2-0 advantage just three minutes later.
The freshman proved her versatility once more before the end of the first half, deftly weaving her way through the defense as she dribbled inside the circle and slapped another shot past Holy Cross goalkeeper Maya Langman to put the Crimson up, 3-0.
“On her second goal, it was a team attack where the forwards kept it wide and kept to the sides really well,” van Herwaarden said. “That allowed Hannah to go to the middle. The defenders didn’t pick her up, and that allowed her to get the goal.”
Rea put home Harvard’s last tally of the game in the 61st minute off of a penalty corner. Although she was held scoreless throughout the rest of the contest, Wellington remained relentless as she rattled off four more shots before the final horn sounded.
“I knew that I was wide open across on the top of the net and I could get the shots off, because the rest of my team had worked so hard to drive the endline or cut out of the space so that they could set me up for the goals,” Wellington said. “It just shows you how team-oriented we are…. I ended up getting the goals, but it was never going to happen unless my other teammates set me up the way they did for each one.”
A freshman from Brentwood, N.H., Wellington comes to Harvard with plenty of success under her belt, having earned four varsity letters on the Phillips Exeter field hockey team and captaining the squad for two years.
The midfielder is eager to experience the higher level of play and competition that the college game has to offer.
“I’m so used to high school play where nobody really knows what they’re doing,” Wellington said. “Here all the girls know so much about the sport and are so dedicated, and it’s a completely different environment when you’re playing with the team that we have, and when everyone’s so supportive of each other and just so knowledgeable about the sport.”
After a disappointing 2013 season, the Crimson is looking to finally realize the potential that has been lurking on its roster for the past few years.
“As a team, we always talk about our goals and what we want to do,” Wellington said. “I just want to have the team connect really well and be able to capitalize on every opportunity, because our team has so much potential this year. You can already see from the first two games that...we’re already beginning to capitalize on that potential, and I just want us to be able to follow through on all of our hard work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (2-0) opened its 2014 season with two games this weekend, emerging victorious against Bryant (0-4) on Friday night, and over Holy Cross (2-2) on Sunday afternoon at Jordan Field.
HARVARD 4, HOLY CROSS 0
The Crimson maintained control of the offensive end throughout Sunday’s game, taking 24 shots while limiting the Crusaders to a mere six.
“One of our main goals was to come out strong in the first five minutes,” captain Caitlin Rea said. “We were working on competing from the start. That’s what kept our tempo up the whole game.”
Harvard coach Tjerk Van Herwaarden especially noted the control his team demonstrated over Holy Cross, and he predicts the competitive, quick play the Crimson displayed will be evident going forward.
“Some nervousness is normal on the first game day,” van Herwaarden said. “That slowed us down against Bryant. That’s gone and I think we are clearly growing to the level we want to be and today was a great step in the right direction.”
The first goal over Holy Cross came from senior Kaitlyn Boudah in under 10 minutes. Boudah received the ball smoothly from senior Catriona McDonald, finishing right in front of the goal.
Freshman Hannah Wellington scored two goals during the first half as well, with her second coming unassisted as the forward dribbled through Bryant’s defense.
Rea capped off the day’s scoring on a penalty corner at 61:34 with assists from classmate Noel Painter and junior Madison Jung. HARVARD 3, BRYANT 2
While Harvard looked like a completely different team in Sunday’s game, dominating offensively against Holy Cross from the opening whistle, one thing was clear at the weekend’s conclusion: the large presence of young talent on the field.
Before Wellington scored her two goals in Sunday’s game, a sophomore took center stage on Friday night as Marissa Balleza punched in a pair of scores.
“The team creates a great environment,” van Herwaarden said. “When the freshmen join each year, the seniors know that going to Harvard is overwhelming and the least overwhelming area of your Harvard experience should be the field hockey team. We’re all out here for the same goal. That creates a bond that I think showed today.”
In addition to Wellington’s goals, van Herwaarden recognized the importance of plays by sophomore Elizabeth Warner and freshman Ellie Cookson from the midfield as well.
“The whole team deserves a really big compliment of being able to create a situation where everyone could play,” van Herwaarden said. “All the freshmen played. The biggest thing was that we really came out as a team, and deserved this win together.
On Friday night, the Bulldogs started the game with a goal off a penalty corner in the first 10 minutes of play, followed by three additional shots and pressure on the offensive end.
Painter responded with Harvard’s first goal of the season at 21:12, carrying the ball up the field and finishing after a quick give-and-go from Balleza.
Balleza kept the momentum going with a goal five minutes later, following up on a blocked shot with her own that bounced right over the defenders’ heads.
The Bulldogs opened the second half with a goal in the 51st minute, again off of a corner penalty. But Balleza responded once more, adding what would prove to be the game-winning goal less than two minutes later.
With a team composed of 21 athletes, the Crimson prides itself on being 21 players strong. The bench saw significant playing time over the weekend, contributing on the field with assists in both games and a goal on Friday night.
“Our team has a level of respect,” Wellington said. “The freshmen aren’t too scared to step up and perform when we’re on the field. Because there’s the same consistency throughout all four years, it’s really fluid movement on and off the field. We’re all one unit.”
