After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When thousands descend on the United States Capitol Jan. 21 to join the Women’s March on Washington, a demonstration planned around Donald Trump’s inauguration, hundreds of Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni will walk among them.
With the protest now less than a month away, Harvard student and alumni groups have planned trips to the March in an attempt to encourage attendance. To date, around 400 Harvard affiliates have said they intend to march.
Organizers began planning the March the morning after Nov. 8’s presidential election, when Trump won the presidency in an upset victory over Hillary Clinton. The demonstration, slated for the day after Trump’s inauguration, is meant to “send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office... that women’s rights are human rights,” according to the event website.
Over the course of Trump’s controversial campaign, the political outsider’s rhetoric and behavior toward women came under national scrutiny. In October, for example, a 2005 tape surfaced revealing Trump boasting in sexually explicit terms of his efforts to attract and grope women.
Organizers of the march expect more than 200,000 people from across the United States to participate, according to The Boston Globe. Marchers will gather near the Capitol building at 10 a.m. before continuing west along Independence Ave., according to plans listed on the website.
“I think that it’s a good chance for Harvard students to get involved with national issues and show that they really care about other people,” Eliza R. Ennis ’19 said.
Ennis is Harvard’s undergraduate organizer for the Massachusetts Chapter of the March on Washington, and will coordinate transportation for College students who want to carpool from Cambridge. She said around 45 Harvard undergraduates have committed to attending the March to date.
Groups of interested demonstrators have also formed at the Graduate School of Education, the Medical School, the Law School, the Graduate School of Design, and the Kennedy School, according to Tracie D. Jones, the assistant director of student diversity and inclusion programs at the Ed School. Jones, who helped organize a 55-seater bus to D.C. for Ed School students, said she has been in contact with student leaders from each of these groups.
Jones said she believed “a couple hundred” total Harvard undergraduate and graduate students will march on Jan. 21, though she has not tracked registration. A group for interested Kennedy School students on the messaging app WhatsApp currently has 256 members, she added.
“In my five years [at the Ed School], I have not seen anything like this,” Jones said.
Alumni have also made efforts to organize for the March; D.C. resident Nina J. Gardner ’82 said she started a Facebook group for interested members of her class and has planned a “poster and pasta dinner” the night before the March, in addition to “coffee and cocoa” that morning.
“[Trump’s] campaign was so misogynist and hateful that we want to show that we can gather women from all walks of life and parts of the country to say, ‘NO, your words (and deeds) in this campaign were not acceptable,’” she wrote in an email. “You cannot trounce on our hard fought rights as women.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 5, 2017 at 1:03 p.m. 
Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX Officer, will leave Harvard on Jan. 17 to accept a position in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, the University announced Wednesday.
Bill D. McCants, the University’s Deputy Title IX Officer, will serve as the Acting Title IX Officer after Karvonides’s departure. Karvonides, who worked for the federal government before coming to Harvard, will serve as the Enforcement Director for the federal agency that oversees colleges and universities’ compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, among other nondiscrimination laws.
In her new role, Karvonides will advise top officials at OCR headquarters and work with regional directors around the country on other areas of civil rights law in addition to Title IX. Her new job, which will begin on Jan. 18 in Washington, D.C., involves working with elementary and secondary education institutions, as well as colleges and universities.
“Just being able to go back to my broader portfolio of civil rights work is important to me,” Karvonides said. “I’m excited to work with the folks in headquarters but I am also really excited to work with the regional directors.”
Karvonides, who previously worked in OCR’s Boston Office, said she looks forward to “being involved with civil rights work in other parts of the United States.”
Karvonides came to Cambridge in 2013 as Harvard’s first University-wide Title IX Officer. Under her tenure, Harvard unveiled a new policy and set of procedures governing how the University responds to cases of sexual harassment and assault. She served as the first director of the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the central office that handles sexual harassment complaints from across the University.
Initially understaffed, Karvonides's office established a “pipeline program” to grow ODR and bolster the the office’s ability to handle a growing caseload. She also took a series of steps to publicize information about the University’s Title IX resources, including launching a new website and publishing Frequently Asked Questions documents.
"I think the most challenging thing, especially with ODR, was having to build it so quickly,” Karvonides said. “It’s a complex program to get up and running and to have to do that in such a short time frame was difficult, but the payoff was well worth it."
But her time at Harvard was not without challenges. In 2014, before the University announced Harvard’s new Title IX policies, undergraduate students charged that the Harvard College’s response to sexual assault complaints violated federal guidelines, and the federal government opened an investigation.  Months later, OCR, where Karvonides will now work, found that Harvard Law School’s “current and prior” sexual assault policies violated federal Title IX law.
The new policies that Karvonides helped craft were also the subject of intense pushback from Law School professors who charged that Harvard’s approach to sexual assault was “stacked against the accused.” The Law School eventually adopted its own set of procedures for investigating sexual assault complaints, departing from the University’s once-centralized framework.
Harvard also faced a Title IX lawsuit during Karvonides’s tenure, when a recent alumna filed a suit last February charging that the University mishandled her sexual harassment case and violated Title IX. The University later filed to dismiss the suit.
Karvonides said she is happy with the progress Harvard has made to respond to sexual assault on campus in the last few years. In an email to colleagues, Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell delineated the work Karvonides has done and thanked her for "her tremendous service."
“In her time at the University, Mia has helped create a strong framework to help Harvard prevent instances of sexual harassment and assault,” Newell wrote in an email to her colleagues announcing Karvonides’s departure. “We are grateful for her service to the University community, and we are glad to see her continue her important work in Title IX and more broadly in other Federal civil rights area.”
Karvonides said she is proud of the increase in the number of complaints filed with ODR and disclosures made to Title IX coordinators during her tenure—a development she believes is indicative of students growing more trustful of the Title IX office. Title IX Coordinators at the College received 121 disclosures of potential sexual assault incidents in the last academic year, nearly a fourfold increase from the 2013-2014 school year. ODR has also continued to received an increased number of complaints.
“The fact that people are coming forward to file a complaints is an important progress point,” Karvonides said. “It’s not enough to have a good procedure and have well trained staff and have a good process in place if no one is accessing it. I can tell you, with every investigation that’s been conducted, every finding we’ve made, I can stand 100 percent behind each and every case.”
Newell is leading transition efforts at ODR as Karvonides prepares to leave the University. Ongoing projects such as online training modules will proceed on schedule, Karvonides said. She and Newell are working to ensure that the transition is “seamless” and Title IX coordinators across schools continue to receive support during the process.
“We’ve got a good group of people to keep things going,” Karvonides said. “Some of the transition planning is keeping projects moving and the day to day work on track but then also with an eye towards moving forward.”
In recent years, ODR has worked more closely with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response—a trend Karvonides said will continue after her departure. The offices have collaborated on training programs and partnerships with peer counselor groups on campus.
“We’re constantly looking for different ways where we can partner with OSAPR,” she said. “The two offices have distinct roles but there are so many opportunities for us to move forward together in supporting students in this area.”
Karvonides also said ODR is exploring new online tools and offerings, such as an online training module for faculty and staff like the one the College debuted for students last fall.
Karvonides declined to comment on the search for her successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Law Review, one of the most prestigious legal journals in the country, often receives submissions from some of the country's top lawyers and law professors. Never, though, has a sitting President of the United States published a piece in the Law Review—until Thursday.
In an article titled “The President’s Role in Advancing Criminal Justice Reform,” President Barack Obama reflects on the Obama Administration's efforts to limit the use of solitary confinement and start mentoring programs to guide young people away from committing crimes, among other criminal justice reforms. During his presidency, Obama commuted the sentences over a thousand federal prisoners, more than the past 11 presidents combined, according to the article.
In the piece, Obama, whose election as the first black president of the Law Review first propelled him into the national spotlight, argues that the executive branch should address the shortcomings of the criminal justice system. Despite the progress made during his administration, Obama noted that policy makers must continue reform efforts. He wrote that it is important to acknowledge racial bias in the criminal justice system, but maintained that criminal justice policies affect all Americans.
“It would be a tragic mistake to treat criminal justice reform as an agenda limited to certain communities,” Obama wrote in the article, which spans more than 50 pages. “All Americans have an interest in living in safe and vibrant neighborhoods, in raising their children in a country of equal treatment and second chances, and in entrusting their liberty to a justice system that remains true to our highest ideals.”
In a call with members of the press organized by the White House, Michael L. Zuckerman ’10, the president of the Harvard Law Review, said that editing a piece by written by the President was particularly engaging, especially considering Obama’s ties to the Law Review.
“For our team, the President’s piece provided an editing experience we will never forget,” Zuckerman said. “We put all of our pieces through a rigorous editing process, and this piece was no exception, just on a compressed timeline given the President’s schedule.”
Zuckerman said believes the piece that will advance the national conversation surrounding criminal justice reform.
“As we consider the future of American criminal justice, understanding our system’s complex web of stakeholders and decision-makers is crucial for charting the best path forward,” Zuckerman said. “As we look at it, the President’s piece offers a kind of map, a guide to today’s complicated, varied legal terrain, and a set of tools to help navigate and shape it.”
Neil Eggleston, White House Counsel, said during the press call that he saw particular significance in this piece being published in the Harvard Law Review.
“It is my hope, and indeed the hope of all of us who work on these issues, that by publishing a piece of this scope in the Harvard Law Review, that the President can educate the next generation of lawyers about why these issues are so important, how they interact with the powers and limitations of the Executive Branch, and what we have done, and most importantly, what work there is left to do,” Eggleston said.
