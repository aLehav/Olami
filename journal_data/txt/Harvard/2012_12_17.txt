After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years ago, the private equity hotelier HEI Hotels & Resorts bought Le Meridien hotel in Cambridge Central Square. Under the new management, employees say that the working conditions have steadily declined. This past summer, a survey of workers at the Le Meridien in Cambridge found that 93 percent of workers surveyed believe HEI does not care about their well-being and that nearly 85 percent of workers do not believe they have adequate supplies or are given the appropriate amount of time to deliver high-quality guest service. Further, 94 percent of workers say that working conditions have not gotten better since HEI took over management of the hotel.
In October, workers at the Le Meridien Cambridge called on management to agree to a fair process for them to decide whether to form a union—the same process used by workers in hotels across the United States. HEI management refused the workers' demand. Now, the workers have called a boycott on the hotel until management agrees to grant the workers a fair process. These workers depend on tips from customers as part of their income; the fact that the workers are boycotting their own hotel goes to show just how serious this situation is.
Every Thursday, hotel workers, union organizers, and community stakeholders all come together and picket outside the Le Meridien Cambridge. They call for hotel guests to support the worker-led boycott by checking out of the hotel.
The University has participated in multiple rounds of investment with HEI Hospitality, the second of which is still ongoing. While Harvard Management Company announced this past April that it would not reinvest University funds in any future rounds of fundraising after campus activism surrounding HEI’s troubling labor practices, the money HEI used to purchase the Le Meridien Cambridge likely came from a fund Harvard was invested in, meaning that our university is probably invested in this hotel. (The actual message announcing non-reinvestment cited financial reasons for non-reinvestment, rather than ethical, although Brown University issued a similar statement declaring that it would not reinvest in HEI due to poor labor standards.)
While any Harvard funds currently invested in Le Meridien are already spoken for, the many student organizations and other Harvard-affiliated groups who patronize the hotel’s services have much more control over their association with Le Meridien and HEI. Like other organizations across Boston, the City of Cambridge itself has joined in on the boycott. The City Council voted unanimously in October to boycott the hotel’s services—including using it as the reception space for its biennial swearing-in ceremony—until “it has been confirmed that HEI changes its practices and treats its workers with the dignity and respect they deserve.”
Harvard student groups (including the Harvard Debate Council, which has 45 rooms rented out for their February debate tournament), conferences, and departments booking event spaces or hosting out-of-town guests should follow this lead, echoing the City of Cambridge’s commitment to supporting workplaces that are both safe and fair. We urge all groups on campus to stand with Le Meridian workers by publicly supporting the ongoing boycott and by taking their groups’ business to other local hotels with fair union processes and strong labor practices. A union hotel guide put out by Hotel Workers Rising suggests possible alternatives to dine, sleep, or meet, which include the Courtyard by Marriott, the Fairmonts in Battery Wharf and Copley Plaza, the Omni Parker, the InterContinental, the Ritz Carlton, and the W Boston.
The Student Labor Action Movement stands in solidarity with the workers at the Le Meridien fighting HEI’s unethical labor practices in unfair layoffs, mistreatment of workers, and union busting. In our commitment, we endorse the ongoing boycott of the HEI-managed Le Meridien Cambridge and San Francisco hotels. We urge all others—especially Harvard student groups that often book rooms in hotels like the Le Meridien—to join us. Please do not dine, sleep or meet in these hotels until the labor dispute has been resolved and the workers have been awarded the justice and equality that they deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Wouldn’t you eventually get bored?” Like clockwork, the question arises when I tell someone quixotically, arrogantly, that I plan on living forever. From the limited perspective of 20 years, even the prospect of living another six or seven decades in full color can be impossible to envisage. Hedging, I answer that assuming a world where radical life extension is possible, there will be no telling as to how different the human experience will be from what we know—that is to say, where 200-year-olds won’t merely be stuck playing very, very slow mah-jongg.
Not to speak of the tremendous gains in average life expectancy made over the last few years, radical life extension is no longer the fringe interest of a few high-tech narcissists. In a private competition sponsored by the Methuselah Foundation, genetic researchers engineered a house mouse to perdure for five years, a dramatic improvement over Mus musculus’ average lifespan of one and a half to two. Following the assumption that aging is above all a material process with discrete genetic and biochemical components, we can be sure that it’s possible—in more than theory—to reverse-engineer and manipulate a process that has bounded and shaped every creature’s existence from time immemorial.
In one sense, the chance to extend our lives through pharmacological supplements, hormone therapy, body part replacements, and cryonics could mark Homo sapiens’ most decisive step away from creaturehood. And unsettling though it may be to many readers, the future of the next few generations will be defined by the moral and policy implications of humanity’s technological lurch toward immortality. Anticipating these developments, it’s important to challenge the base assumptions about mortality—there is no life without death, manipulating nature is fundamentally sinful—all the while acknowledging how difficult it is to shake them.
Life extension specialist and futurist Aubrey de Grey, a freewheeling Englishman with an incomparable beard, is convinced that the first person to make it to 150 has already been born, a prospect not so difficult to imagine in light of the progress already made in recent decades toward longer, better-fulfilled lifespans. Although it was once common to speak of 70 as a hard-earned, desirable terminus, First World 70-year-olds are more active than ever before; by virtue of conventional medical progress alone, Japanese women now live an average of 86 years.
And although the chasm between 150 and forever seems unbridgeable, the non-linear pace of progress in the fields of biotechnology and artificial intelligence suggests that by 2162, most if not all of today’s incipient technologies will be in full bloom. Alcor, the leading commercial provider of cryonic suspension services and formerly home to Ted Williams’ head, has to date brought specially-treated dogs back to life from extended periods of deep freeze. If similarly viable treatments are in the medium-term offing for humans, it is likely that many will elect to go on ice until the next stage of life extension technology comes into play.
But needn’t we die? It is hard to comprehend the deaths of loved ones, millennia of historical generations, and organisms of all sizes without some sort of teleology: for the religious, a metaphysical world-to-come, for the irreligious, an evolutionarily generated cycle of life. Setting our time horizons more conservatively, death remains a constant of which we need to make some sort of sense. However, it’s crucial that we appreciate how much longer the list of unpleasant inevitabilities once was: dangerous childbirth, banditry, autocracy, malnutrition, plague. Call it unnatural, but human ingenuity has done away with scourge after scourge, each once understood as a meaningful, natural, part of life’s universal rhythm. And while we might not know exactly how, it’s reasonably clear that life can go on after death.
Returning to the original question—in essence: “Why choose to live forever if forever really just means eternal boredom and senescence?”—it’s apparent that living forever would mean something other than continuing as our current selves. Technology futurists are reasonably certain that at some point in the next century, we’ll be enmeshed in networks of artificial intelligence, bodily modified beyond immediate recognition, and confronted with a new set of identity questions, societal challenges, and existential ambitions.
If I’m fortunate enough to make it to 150, I expect to find a world where caring about ethnic politics in the Middle East, wearing university colors, impressing girls, and investigating my ancestral origins won’t be of much, if any, use. In other words, I expect that I’ll need to invent a new self for a radically new world. More than anything I can imagine, it’ll be a tall order. We have good evolutionary reason to love ourselves to death rather than contemplate being completely reconfigured. It’s a daunting prospect to imagine, but it’s anything but boring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the summer of 2010, I was an intern (read coffee-fetcher) on New York Congresswoman Carolyn J. Maloney’s re-election bid. One of my most vivid memories of that time was an argument I had with a campaign staffer about the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, New Deal legislation that required banks to separate their commercial and investment operations. Maloney, along with many other Democrats, I pointed out, had voted for that bill, a culprit in the 2008 economic meltdown. My friend, a die-hard socialist who had previously inveighed against Wall Street, unstintingly defended his candidate. “It looked like the right thing to do... Everyone thought so,” he averred. I am a man of the left, and I wholeheartedly supported Maloney. But I didn’t venerate her, and certainly wasn’t going to allow her or any politician to dictate my opinions.
The sense of déjà vu was overwhelming during this fall’s elections, marked as they were by shameless leader worship and its attendant intellectual laziness and ideological rigidity. The tone of the Obama 2012 campaign was just a tad less salvational than Obama 2008 (which will forever be remembered for gems like “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for” and “We are the change we seek”). Predictably, the liberal reaction was equally rapturous and uncritical. Here in Massachusetts, though, Obama’s Vulcan was eclipsed by Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren’s Venus. As reported in a New York Times profile of her, men passed her love notes and crowds jumped for joy at the sight of her. The New Republic said she had a cult following that came to her aid unconditionally.
This phenomenon of leader worship is bigger than this election, Barack Obama, or Elizabeth Warren. It looms over the whole political process. Twenty-five years after Ronald Reagan left the White House, the Republican faithful remain devoted to his message of low taxes, small government, and pro-business policies. To a lesser extent, Democrats still prostrate themselves at the altar of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.
In canonizing the Gipper and Dr. New Deal, zealots have a penchant for misconstruing their patron saints’ views. Reagan raised taxes multiple times and exploded the deficit. Though he took drastic measures to advance his neo-liberal agenda, for example, by firing striking air-traffic controllers, it is doubtful that he would have threatened to pitch the country into recession to get his way, as conservatives did during last summer’s debt-ceiling imbroglio.
Neither was Roosevelt a dogmatist. He faced a set of unprecedented challenges, and was willing to try anything to ease the Depression. Preserving and expanding the social safety net he jury-rigged—and that Lyndon Johnson improved—is a worthy goal, but too many on the left reject tweaks of any kind, embracing the hide-bound thinking he abhorred. Intransigence has led to immobilism, and today that has brought us to a precipice, "the fiscal cliff."
It’s taken me a while to figure out why I most despise leader worship, and this is because it is a close cousin of the personality cult, fascism’s calling card. Now, I’m not calling Warren enthusiasts squadristi or Obama 2008 fanatics Brownshirts. Nonetheless, comparisons of Warren to a super-hero and characterizations of Obama as the Messiah—Oprah famously referred to him as The One—are eerily reminiscent of the fascist cult.
As Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi, a professor at UC Berkeley, notes in her book Fascist Spectacle, Mussolini was, like Obama, seen as a savior, and as omnipotent and immortal. According to propaganda, he didn’t need sleep. He skied shirtless in the winter. He could tame lions and stop volcanic eruptions. He was, in Falasca-Zamponi’s words, “the new man” able to “establish with the “masses” a novel relationship founded on emotions and the power of myth,” deriving his authority to govern from charismatic legitimacy.
In the United States, leaders can form direct connections with their constituents. But no figure should be held as divine, divinely-ordained, or divinely-endowed. It’s bad for the mind, bad for the country, and bad for democracy, and something we should all resist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson published a three-part series on mental health at Harvard. The story included interviews with several students who had attempted suicide as well as interviews with University administrators and peer mental health counselors. The narratives related in the series were at once bone chilling and all too familiar: Interviewees described how Harvard’s culture of stiff upper lips and unflagging one-upmanship led them to feel inadequate, as if they were the only ones struggling. Perhaps even more sobering was the College’s suicide rate, calculated by The Crimson to be about double the national average for college students.
While some students highlighted allegedly inadequate service at University Mental Health Services, it is clear that the greatest impediment to mental health at Harvard lies in our culture. The shiny veneer of perfection we all don subtly stigmatizes hardship, making those experiencing mental health issues more reluctant to talk openly about their problems. And while the problem is primarily cultural, the University could do more to make UMHS proactive and accessible. A good first step toward improving discourse about mental health on campus would be for the administration to release statistics about the yearly mental health survey.
When it comes to creating a culture of honesty with regard to personal struggles, the burden falls on each of us in our daily interactions. One student, going by the name of Martin, related a mundane but telling common experience: “You come back from summer break, and everyone tells about their amazing summer. They tell perfect, unflawed stories. You begin feeling that everything we do is supposed to be successful; everyone is supposed to be so happy. It leads to a culture that amplifies feelings of inadequacy.” This situation repeats itself hundreds, if not thousands, of times a day in dining halls and common rooms. Surrounded by peers who can come across as flawless automatons, it is daunting to be the one to admit to struggling with grades, friends, or mental health. Our widespread reluctance to speak honestly about personal difficulty thus reinforces itself daily. For this reason, the administration ought to make figures on depression, suicidal thoughts, and other mental health issues public so that we can break the veneer of perfection that stifles frank conversation on mental health.
The series also described widespread confusion regarding mental health-related leaves of absence as well as general pessimism regarding the quality of care available at UMHS. Through programs like Student Mental Health Liaisons, the University is taking some steps to improve discourse on mental health on campus, but it is apparent that more needs to be done. First, the University ought to make clear the fact that no one will be forced to take a leave of absence for coming forward about mental health issues. Second, the University should consider such steps as assigning each student to a mental health professional in the same way that it currently assigns students to primary care physicians. This will normalize mental health as part of the healthcare regimen at Harvard, and it will make students more comfortable in reaching out.
All in all, the current state of stigmatization around mental illness is built by thousands of subtle and otherwise innocuous interactions every day. It is perhaps a natural element of such a competitive and high-pressure environment as Harvard. But all of us can and should take more action to improve the mental health of our campus.

Pre-Term Planning data for Spring 2012 indicates an increased interest in computer science classes and suggests that a few courses with capped enrollments will be competitive.
Notably, 127 students reported their intention to take Computer Science 181: “Intelligent Machines,” a 182 percent increase from the last time the course was offered in Spring 2011.
Professor Ryan P. Adams, who is teaching “Intelligent Machines” for the first time, said although he does not expect to change the course’s material if it ends up larger than in previous years, there may be some logistical concerns that he hopes to avoid with the support of his qualified teaching fellows.
“The class wasn’t offered last year, so there’s a backlog of interested students,” said Adams. “This is the only course that deals with machine learning and big data, a topic that was on the front page of The New York Times recently.”
Heightened interest in the class may also be the result of the recent increase in computer science concentrators.
“The success and popularity of CS50 [“Introduction to Computer Science 1”] has led to this ripple effect of more people being exposed to and then excited about computer science,” said Adams.
In addition to “Intelligent Machines,” 264 students have expressed an interest in Professor John G. Morrisett’s Introduction to  Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II,” the course that follows CS50—a 40 percent increase from last year’s 189 enrolled students.
PTP numbers, which were obtained by the Crimson from a faculty member, also provide a hint at the classes for which entry will be especially competitive this spring.
Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature,” which centers on authors like J.K. Rowling, the Brothers Grimm, Lewis Carroll, and Hans Christian Andersen, had 411 students express interest. Only a lucky 28 will be randomly lotteried into the course, suggesting that as low as 6.8 percent of those who indicated interest will actually be able to take the class.
“I feel uncomfortable capping the course at 28, and I wish I could accommodate all the students who apply,” said Maria Tatar, the course’s professor and chair of the folklore and mythology department. “At the same time, I was thrilled with the commitment level of the students in the course last year.”
Tatar, who has conducted the course in both a seminar and lecture format in the past, said it would be difficult for her to run a large lecture course with a staff of 8 to 10 teaching fellows while also teaching a second course and chairing the department.
According to Tatar, another factor in favor of the capped enrollment is that few graduate students have indicated interest in serving as teaching fellows for the course.
“I have had only two applications this year from graduate students,” Tatar said.
The College originally introduced PTP in the fall of 2010 in an effort to make logistical preparations for the courses in advance. However, the numbers obtained by the tool have not reliably translated into actual enrollment in the past, as discovered in the last few years of data collection.

As more than 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty employees face the prospect of a new year without a new contract, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers is taking a holiday-themed approach to its stalled negotiation process.
On Thursday and Friday, hundreds of employees wrote holiday cards addressed to University President Drew G. Faust in which they shared season’s greetings and requests for the Harvard administration to support a proposed contract for HUCTW—the union which represents University librarians, secretaries, lab technicians, and other employees.
“This is definitely our first use of glitter glue,” HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said. “It’s been really cool to see how our members have been thoughtful and creative about it.”
Jaeger said that the cards included photographs of coworkers, family members, and pets, original humorous cartoons, and even quotations from William James, Dean Acheson, and Abraham Lincoln.
Negotiations have made little progress since June 30, when HUCTW’s contract was originally scheduled to expire.
Because Harvard and HUCTW failed to reach an agreement on a new contract, both sides agreed to keep the terms of the old contract in effect until a resolution could be reached.
“It’s kind of like nothing has worked exactly right...in the past eight or nine months,” Jaeger said.
Despite the delayed contract negotiations, Jaeger stressed that HUCTW members still have great respect for Faust.
“A lot of our members like to feel that there’s a special and meaningful connection between President Faust and the hardworking staff,” Jaeger said, adding that the cards were meant to “renew that connection.”
Andrew Williston, a curatorial assistant at the Museum of Comparative Zoology and a member of HUCTW, said that his primary goal in writing a card was to share “warm holiday wishes.”
“As a university, I think we’re kind of a family,” Williston said.
Employing a similar strategy to raise awareness, the Kennedy School Progressive Caucus prepared a giant card signed by HUCTW supporters, which will be delivered to Faust along with HUCTW’s other cards.
“We found that there was sort of a striking lack of awareness on campus,” said Caucus member and Kennedy School student Alexander “Alexi” White.
The group collected close to one hundred signatures on the card, according to White. According to White, the card contained no specific request for a deal, but rather for recognition of HUCTW’s contributions to the University, and the Caucus’ hope for a “fair and equitable agreement.”
“We study these sorts of issues,” White said. “We wanted to...bring what we learned in the classroom and show people that it’s also what’s happening all around us.”

The Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies named Elaine Papoulias as its new Executive Director earlier this month.
According to a CES press release, Papoulias has long been affiliated with CES. She previously served as the Director of the Kokkalis Program on Southeastern and East-Central Europe at the Harvard Kennedy School for thirteen years. During her time at the Kennedy School, Papoulias co-chaired the Center’s Southeastern Europe Study Group.
She took over directorship of the Center from Trisha Craig, who served as the Executive Director of the CES for seven years and is now the Director of Wheelock College-Singapore.
Papoulias was chosen for the position after a series of interviews in the fall with former faculty directors and current faculty affiliates, as well as with some of the Center’s staff.
“What they were looking for is someone with strong leadership skills,” Papoulias said. “Also someone who really knew Europe well and someone who is comfortable innovating and motivating.”
Papoulias’s experience with Europe began as a child, living in Greece with her family, before she moved to the United States.
According to Craig, some of the Executive Director’s responsibilities include developing new programs, thinking of ways to support the graduate student affiliates, and running the Visiting Scholar’s program.
“I think Elaine will be fantastic,” Craig wrote in an email. “She has a stellar track record of running an academic program; she knows Harvard extremely well and has a lot of credibility among the faculty across various schools.”
Papoulias said that the Center tries to create a sense of community for undergraduate and graduate students, hosting a space where many students go to work on papers and dissertations relating to Europe.
“The shared sense of space gives the Center a unified camaraderie and sense of purpose,” Papoulias said. While Papoulias said she hopes that the Center will become even more open to the student and faculty community on campus duing her tenure, she specifically expressed interest in making the issues of Southeastern Europe a greater part of the Center’s initiatives.
“Coming from a background that comes from Southeastern Europe and understanding what a critical moment it is in the developing space for these communities, I’d like to see the countries of Southeastern Europe very firmly rooted in the initiatives of the center,” she said.

Ever wanted to study in a personal zip-up capsule or publish a literary mix-tape? “Dunce Capsule” and “Recon-Texts” are just two of the latest additions to LABRARY, a showcase space that features a variety of innovative installations aimed at reshaping conceptions of what the traditional library looks and feels like.
LABRARY, which opened last month, was created by students and faculty from the Harvard Graduate School of Design with funding from the Harvard College Library and the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. The most recent addition to the space is a set of works produced by students in the GSD course ADV-09125: “Library Test Kitchen.”
“This project is about exploring technology and space, and about looking at libraries from a very broad point of view,” said Jeff Goldenson, a designer at the Library Innovation Lab and one of the course instructors. “Students took charge of the creation of LABRARY completely—they designed the façade and made the branding.”
One of the new additions to the space is a pair of reading tables with a set of speakers embedded into the surface. Users are not allowed to interact with the speakers, whose only role is to emit background noise at a constant volume.
The designer, master of architecture candidate Hattie Stroud, described the concept behind the table’s creation in a press release.
“I do my best studying while in a lecture for another class because I can actively ignore the lecturer and focus on the task at hand,” Stroud wrote. “These lecturing Topical Tables provide a study space of slight distraction, similar to the background murmur of a lecture hall.”
Another installation, entitled BOOKFACE, features a photo booth that allows LABRARY visitors to pose on a murder mystery set with a Macbook covering their faces—a comment on the changing face of the library as more of its content enters the cyberspace.
“[BOOKFACE] is an online photo opera that invites visitors to reflect on their relationship with the digital,” said Nicolas Rivard, the project’s designer and a GSD graduate. “My project is very much a reflection upon the things that we sacrifice in the process [of digitization].”
Rivard’s creation, and others like it, are especially relevant in light of Harvard’s ongoing efforts to make its own collections publicly available online.
“We are not trying to prescribe what the future of our libraries should be,” Goldenson said. “We do believe in books and tradition—but as library content gets digital, we ask, what could the space of the library potentially mold into?”
Obtaining the space to showcase the projects publicly was “serendipitous,” according to Teaching Fellow and GSD graduate Jessica Yurkofsky.
“The course will be repeated next fall,” Yurkofsky said, “and I would really like to see something like this set up again.”
Goldenson said that opening the space to the public would provide a valuable learning opportunity for students.
“Anyone can come here to meet or study. Getting feedback from the world beyond of the classroom is a fantastic opportunity,” he said. “It forces you to be very clear with what you are doing.”
LABRARY will remain open to the public on 92 Mount Auburn Street through December 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A menu featuring reasonably priced burgers, hot dogs, and shakes—along with a $10 Starvin’ Student deal that includes a hamburger, beer, and fries—drew a constant stream of customers to the official opening of Tasty Burger, Harvard Square’s newest restaurant, on Sunday.
Located at 40 JFK Street—the former home of 7-Eleven—the new two-floor restaurant offers classic burger joint food, along with several combo options. The first floor offers a traditional diner atmosphere with polished counters, tables, and counters that look onto JFK Street and Mt. Auburn Street. The first floor also features two touch-screen Coca-Cola machines that feature over 100 flavors.
The stairs at the front of the restaurant lead to a cavern-like bar with additional tables and a billiard tables.
According to co-owner David A. DuBois, the restaurant’s long hours, with full service from 11 a.m. to 4 a.m., will appeal to many different demographics.
The Harvard Square location is the third in the Boston area for the company, which also operates restaurants near Fenway Park and in South Boston.
“What the owners hope to do is make this the flagship location for future success,” said general manager Andrew Markey.
Laura Taylor and Dana Zayas had been shopping in Harvard Square and planned to go to another Tasty Burger location until they discovered that the chain had opened a restaurant in Harvard Square.
“They’re going to do really well here. They’ll serve everyone from the workers and students at lunchtime to the late-night crowd,” said Taylor, a Medford resident.
At 11 a.m. on Sunday, R.J. J. Aquino ’13 and several friends rushed to the restaurant to be among the first to try the new restaurant.
“I think we were customers two, three, and four,” Aquino said.
Although Aquino had never been to a Tasty Burger location before, he was excited by the addition of a fast food burger option to the Square.
“I was really excited we were getting a more traditional burger restaurant in the Square. It’s definitely in the same genre as Five Guys, but I wouldn’t call them fast food,” Aquino said.
Markey said that the majority of negative feedback from the first day surrounded the “fast food” concept.
“I think people expected for it to be more of a fast food experience,” Markey said, noting that most did not realize the burgers are cooked to requested temperatures.
Tasty Burger is the area’s latest restaurant to offer a new take on classic American burgers, with Flat Patties, b.good, and Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage already established in the Square.
Hoping to grab a burger at Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage while in town for his son’s squash tournament, James M. Reum ’68 had been disappointed to see the iconic Harvard Square restaurant was closed on Sundays. But while looking for another option, Reum and his son came across Tasty Burgers.
“You know what I’m going to tell you? The burgers are tasty,” Reum said.
With its long hours and deals, Tasty Burger adds another late-night option for students and Cantabrigians.
“I’m really happy it opened, but I’m mad that winter break is here,” said Zak T. Aossey ’14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Extension School Michael Shinagel went to the Faculty Club for the first time when he was a graduate student, as a guest of late English professor Howard Mumford Jones.
Over lunch—a rare honor for Shinagel, as the Club was generally reserved for Harvard’s most senior echelon of faculty and administration—Jones outlined his vision for their work on a foundation together. “He said, ‘Michael, we will reign jointly like the two kings of Sparta,’” Shinagel recalls. “‘One to admire, and one to perform.’”
Shinagel smiles in his recollection of that first visit. He would eventually serve as a member of the Club’s Managing Board, its most recent president, and a member of the Advisory Board. Over “many a luncheon” at the Club’s renowned Long Table, he would woo new faculty members for the extension school, of which he has been dean since 1975. At the Club, he met visionaries and politicians, wined and dined his colleagues, and put up good friends in the guest rooms on the third floor.
And most recently, in early November, his son was married there in a ceremony with a minister, 60 guests, and a full brunch.
At his lunch with Shinagel so many decades ago, Jones finished his grandiose plan with a humorous—albeit poignant—one-liner. “‘I shall admire,’” he told Shinagel.
That conversation presaged Shinagel’s service to the University. But once a mainstay for the professor progressing through decades of a career at Harvard, the Club today is less likely to serve as the center of professorial social life.
Over time, it has opened its doors to new segments of Harvard’s community, and the nature of the faculty has changed. Once the professors’ clubhouse, the Faculty Club is no longer just the faculty’s club.
OLD MEETS NEW
In days past, women were confined to the Club’s “Ladies Dining Room.” Casual dancing for faculty members took place every Saturday evening. And in 1939, an entertainment committee was created to organize social events for the faculty members.
On a Saturday night 60 years later, the second floor of the Club is likely to be swarming with patrons dressed to the nines. The Faculty Club hosts close to fifty weddings a year, sometimes multiple in a weekend during the busy summer season. The groom might straighten his bow tie in Room Seven; the bride touches up her makeup and soothes her jitters in Room Ten.
On any other day during the school year, these same rooms will be set up for career fairs, company presentations, and community gatherings. On one fall afternoon, the Club hosts McKinsey and Co., the Boston Fulbright Committee, and Chabad House, its hand-painted walls now soaking in corporate and scholarly chatter and the prayers and aspirations of countless students.
One floor up, a dozen doors are flung open to reveal soft-lit chambers with the slanted roofs of a top floor and the small scale of another century; only the small flat-screen televisions set subtly against the paisley wallpaper betray a twenty-first century lodging. The maid says they are almost always booked, and the midday lull is anything but a lull for her as she scrambles to ready the rooms for a new stream of guests.
The basement, too, is empty. Just two years ago, the staff of the Theatre Room would have been bracing themselves for the lunchtime rush as professors dropped by for an inexpensive meal.
Sunlight streams into the conservatory of the Harvard Faculty Club, speckling the gold-embossed plates on the table and the fresh-flower arrangements every few place settings. Glasses and decanters gleam behind the bar, which serves not just fine wines but also Harvard’s Harpoon-brewed specialty beer called “1636.” Club staff wander in and out as they set up the Club’s three first-floor dining rooms for lunch-time buffet. Until 2 p.m., faculty members and their guests will trickle in for one of the fancier—and more expensive—lunch options in the area.
To the right lies the North dining room, once the “Ladies Dining Room,” currently set with tables for four.
Another right brings one to the main dining room. Forty years ago, the focal point of this dark-paneled, luxuriously curtained room was the “long table”—a single dining table which faculty frequented for lunch and conversation.
THE LONG TABLE
For decades, the long table formed the heart of the Faculty Club.
“At the long table, anyone could sit if there was a space, and all conversations were open,” says mechanical engineering professor Frederick H. Abernathy.
Regulars like Abernathy came from all over the University to take their meals here at least once a week, if not every day. Occasionally, former University President Derek C. Bok and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry S. Rosovsky would join them.
Dialogue at the table was vibrant and interdisciplinary; faculty members recounted their travels, discussed their scholarship, debated current events, or shared family stories. Conversation flowed easily over the clatter of cutlery and professors recall the colorful personalities that turned a routine lunch hour into a highlight of the day—from the economist John Kenneth “Ken” Galbraith relating information from FBI documents, to staff members becoming like family.
“I recall some of the managers. One of them for a long time was a very fat guy who must have weighed around 300 pounds. He had a tie clip that was a knife and fork,” Rosovsky says. “Another was a German, and quite severe.”
For lunch, patrons could choose from entrées such as “purée of potato soup with leeks” or “minced goose à la Creole,” followed by frozen pudding, assorted fruits, or cheese. One of the more peculiar dishes joined the menu because of World War II’s meat shortage: horse steak, commonly referred to as “traveler’s delight.”
“It was like—like flavored dental floss,” remembers Shinagel. “It was the most talked about thing on the menu.”
In an adjoining dining room, famous philosophy professor Willard Van Orman Quine and history professor Harry A. Wolfson once held an invitation-only table of their own.
“They would sometimes gesture for other people to join them for lunch—and that was a great honor,” professor emeritus Gerald Holton remembers.
MEMBERS ONLY
Stories about the Club such as Holton’s suggest an aura of elitism and exclusivity that professors do not deny.
“The place itself exuded an atmosphere of considerable importance and dignity,” says Holton, who was first invited to the Faculty Club as a graduate student in physics in the mid-1940s.
Indeed, the Club was built with exclusivity in mind. Armed with an anonymous $25,000 donation from now-identified Allston Burr, the Harvard Corporation set out to erect a new social space for its faculty in 1929. The building, which replaced a yellow “town-and-gown” clubhouse for the Cambridge community at large, would eventually cost just over 12 times that amount.
When it opened in 1931, alcohol was not yet served in accordance with Prohibition restrictions—and the Club would not obtain a license for wine or beer until 1960. Men were required to wear coats and ties; women only received full membership in 1968.
Not even all of Harvard’s male faculty members were fully integrated into the community of the Club. Only tenured professors, for example, congregated around the long table. It was much more difficult for junior faculty, who came and went and lacked long-standing institutional ties, to penetrate the tight-knit social circle of senior professors.
And at some point in the early 90s, the tradition of long table lunch gradually faded, replaced by a dozen smaller tables scattered across the room. Seats were closer to each other, but oddly, the new setting felt less intimate.
A DIFFERENT MENU
Nearly every wall of the Faculty Club is covered in frames: oil portraits of bygone presidents and benefactors, black-and-white photographs of old sports teams, seemingly ancient maps of Harvard, and a cascade of priceless works lent from the Harvard Art Museum’s collection.
Many of the images are a reminder of the “importance” that faculty members remember, the institutional pedigree and elite patronage for which the Club was known. At one time, for example, men would not have entered the Club dressed in anything but suits and ties.
Now, Rosovsky gestures to his own tie-less collar—the new normal. “The University has changed in a way—the ‘clubbiness’ of the whole university in a sense has declined,” Rosovsky muses. “Clubbiness is not contemporary.”
The Club is still bustling, but staff members cater to a different crowd. Potential departmental hires, celebrities, and foreign dignitaries are all likely to pass through, escorted by faculty members trying to impress. Professors frequently rub shoulders with relatives at family weddings, but less frequently share a meal with their colleagues. And students march over the Club’s carpeted interior for information sessions, special dinners, and interviews.
Even those spaces unique to faculty members have evolved. After the Long Table stopped serving, an inexpensive lunch buffet was introduced, tucked under the spiral staircase that faces the Club’s entrance and named after the many vintage posters framed along its blue-paneled walls. In many ways a less formal version of the Long Table, the buffet welcomed professors, lecturers, graduate students, and their guests, offering a quick and relatively inexpensive bite.
“You’d get out of there for under 10 bucks,” Sociology professor Christopher Winship says. “They made you a sandwich and there was specialty pizza.”
For Abernathy, a daily highlight was the fruit bowl, where faculty served themselves. “You can pile on as much as the bowl, and I was very good at being able to walk with a pyramid,” he says.
Though the buffet closed abruptly in 2011, faculty can still eat lunch in the conservatory—and rave about the food and service when they go—but the bill can easily tally at three times the prices they paid for the buffet.
FLOATING APART
Some professors suggest that some of these spaces have disappeared because of financial constraints, But they also admit that as academic culture has changed, faculty members no longer look to the Faculty Club as their Club.
When Abernathy took his meals at the Long Table, lunch was a mandatory occasion for him and his colleagues on the Third Floor of Pierce Hall. “Someone would pound on your door,” he says, and an excuse of “‘I got to get this lecture done,’” was quickly overridden.
Today, most agree that the idea of communal lunch is much less common than it was before. Faculty take lunch alone, at their desks—between writing books, planning classes, and conducting research, a leisurely, conversation-filled lunch hour is a rare luxury.
“That’s one of the things that I think has been lost...to find out how someone from biology relates to someone from philosophy,” says Shinagel. “I think one of the problems—the University has become cut into little pieces, into departments.”
And yet some see the decline of the faculty at the Faculty Club as an inevitable consequence of a diverse academic body.
“Ken Galbraith once described the Harvard faculty as like polar bears,” says Shinagel. “Each on its own ice floe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many Harvard students juggle academics and extracurricular activities, a select number of Harvard undergraduates deal with the additional challenge of attending two colleges at once.
One of a handful of students enrolled in a dual degree program between Harvard and New England Conservatory of Music, Jake S. Dockterman ’13 takes the bus to Boston four to five times a week for rehearsals, lessons, and coaching. By 9 a.m., Dockterman, a saxophonist, is in wind ensemble rehearsal. A few hours later Dockterman is in lecture back at Harvard, where he concentrates in Molecular and Cellular Biology.
“I spend a lot of time on the bus,” Dockterman says. “Sometimes I will even travel twice in one day.”
About 20 current students at Harvard are currently pursuing the dual degree between the two schools. At the end of five years, they will have earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Harvard College and a Master of Music at the New England Conservatory. While the competitive program allows talented students to seriously pursue musical study, those enrolled must find a way to split their time between campuses and their academic and musical aspirations.
‘BEST OF BOTH WORLDS’
While the practice rooms in NEC are filled with Steinways and Yamahas, Chase E. Morrin ’15’s first piano was a toy keyboard from Costco. Soon after he received the instrument when he was eight-years-old, Morrin learned to compose his own work on it. Morrin did not have any sheet music, so he began to experiment with his own methods.
“I kind of made up my own music,” he remembers.
A decade later, Morrin is a jazz composition major at NEC and a neurobiology concentrator at Harvard who is also considering a secondary in computer science.
Morrin says that he was attracted to the dual degree program because he was passionate about both his music and his academic interests. He was particularly impressed by the quality of NEC faculty and its location.
“I have a lot of friends going to Berklee and around here, and I’m always collaborating with people,” he said. “There are so many cool resources available including teachers, classes, and people I can play with.”
Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14 started playing piano at age four, long before discovering her interest in composition. She and her twin sister are both now pursuing the dual degree.
“I was inspired by my twin, who often improvised on the piano,” says Rabinowitz, a history and science concentrator and music composition major.
Rabinowitz says that she never considered solely attending a conservatory. “I wanted to go to a liberal arts school, and there’s no other program like this in the world. I get to have access to a high caliber of musicians and faculty, and am surrounded by the rigor of conservatory environment and the rigor of the academic world,” she says. “It’s the best of both worlds.”
Despite his plans to pursue a career in science, Dockterman, a classical saxophone performance major at NEC, chose to apply to the joint program because of the unique opportunities to rehearse and perform with high caliber musicians. Dockterman picked up the saxophone in fourth grade as part of his school’s band program and continued through high school, participating in numerous district and state festivals. Dockterman’s longtime saxophone teacher encouraged him to consider the dual degree program as an option.
“I was choosing between Yale and this program, but at Yale I wouldn’t be playing saxophone that seriously anymore,” he says. “I was considering saying goodbye to it earlier, but playing with such talented musicians was something I rarely would be able to do.”
Morrin, Rabinowitz, and Dockterman say they are happy to be in the program, despite the significant time commitment and frequent commutes.
Morrin, who travels to NEC two to three times per week, admits, “It’s really busy trying to commute, keep up with lessons, practice, and have a full courseload here.”
“I tell people it’s like ‘varsity music’ in terms of time commitment,” Rabinowitz says. However, Rabinowitz says that stepping off the Harvard campus is often a welcome break. “I find it really refreshing to go off campus once or twice a week,” she said. “It gives me a fresh outlook that is very helpful in the musical and creative process, especially as a composer.”
ONE OF A KIND
Unlike in a traditional two-year master’s program, students enrolled in the Harvard/NEC dual degree program are granted both degrees after a total of five years. For the first three years of the program, students are only required to take private lessons from NEC. However, many also choose to partipate in ensemble groups or seminars. Students begin and complete NEC coursework during their fourth and fifth years in the program.
In addition to fufilling the NEC curriculum requirements, students are still required to complete Harvard’s graduation requirements.
Because of the rigor of the program, Mary Gerbi, a coordinator for the Harvard music department, says that students in the joint program need to show promise above and beyond that of the average student at NEC.
“We need to see that those students will be at the top of their class and stay on top of their work,” she said.
Students apply for admission to both Harvard and NEC separately. Of those admitted to both, roughly 20 then apply for the joint program. NEC conducts the final selection of about five to eight students for the joint program each year, according to Thomas Novak, provost of NEC and dean of the college.
Those numbers, however, do not represent the extent of the interest in the program, which was started in 2005. Novak says that roughly 100 to 125 students indicate plans to apply to the program if admitted to both schools.
“We look for students who are very advanced musically and would love to be a part of our community while also having strong academic interests,” he said.
Thomas F. Kelly, a music professor at Harvard, says that the program seeks to attract a pool of highly skilled and talented instrumentalists, vocalists, and composers.
“The idea was to attract excellent musicians who might not otherwise come to Harvard,” he said. “It is a chance to deepen and enrich the pool of excellent musicians here.”
According to Kelly, the Harvard/NEC program is the only dual undergraduate and graduate degree program between a university and a conservatory. Though similar programs are offered by Columbia and Juilliard, Tufts and NEC, and Oberlin College and Conservatory, those programs only grant dual bachelors degrees.
BEYOND MUSIC
Ouside of class, Dockterman and Rabinowitz use their free time to pursue interests beyond music.
Dockterman was a member of the varsity squash team and is currently one of the captains of the club tennis team. He is also actively involved in his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Rabinowitz is a director for Circle of Women.
On the other hand, Morrin spends most of his time in music, keeping himself busy with recording sessions, frequent performances, and projects with vocalists and other instrumentalists.
Dockterman says he intends to attend medical school and then pursue a Ph.D., rather than pursuing a career in music.
While Morrin says he is still unsure whether he will pursue a musical career after graduation, he says that the experience of studying at NEC has helped him to gain a deeper understanding of the music world. “I don’t really know what my future will be,” he says. “I think it’s more important what I get exposed to.”
Although Rabinowitz has a passion for global health and is interested in attending medical school as well, she hopes to continue composing.
“I know composition will always be part of my life,” she said.
