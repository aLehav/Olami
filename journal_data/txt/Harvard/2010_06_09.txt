After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School faculty members J. Wesley Boyd and Theonia K. Boyd were arrested Sunday night for allegedly serving alcohol to minors at their daughter’s graduation party in Weare, N.H.
Police officers busted the party—at which dozens of teenagers appeared to be intoxicated—around 11:00 p.m. in response to several noise complaints, Weare police lieutenant Jim Carney told NECN. The officers took more than 70 minors into custody and towed 30 cars, several of which were stocked with beer.
"There were cases and cases and bottle of alcohol strewn all over the place," Carney said.
But Mr. Boyd, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical School, said that he and his wife had informed his daughter and her fellow classmates at the St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. that alcohol and drugs would not be permitted at the event, ABC News reported.
Mr. Boyd added that he and his wife—an associate professor of pathology at the Medical School—did not witness any of the students' consumption of alcohol at the party, which was hosted at the home of a family friend.
"Our mistake was saying 'yes' to the party in general," Mr. Boyd said. "We made it clear from the moment our daughter approached us about hosting a party, that no drugs or alcohol would be permitted."
Though Mr. Boyd said that "there's nothing necessarily we would have done differently," he added that a possible error would be the size of the party.
"I would keep it smaller or have five times as many chaperones—and in a confined place," he said.
The Boyds were released on a $500 bail and must appear in court at a later date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 11:55 p.m.
Adam B. Wheeler, the former Harvard student who pled not guilty last month for fabricating his academic history, applied to Stanford University after his dismissal from Harvard and was accepted at the California school for the 2010-2011 academic year.
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice president for university communications at Stanford, confirmed that Wheeler had been accepted to Stanford as an undergraduate for this fall, but said that he will not be enrolling. Wheeler would have been an incoming junior had the school not rescinded his admission.
"Whenever the university becomes aware of a possible misrepresentation of facts in an application for admission, Stanford will investigate," Lapin wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson. "If at any point the university concludes that an applicant has misrepresented their credentials, we will revoke an offer of admission."
Wheeler's admission to Stanford is detailed in new court documents that were filed Wednesday, when Wheeler's attorney, Steven A. Sussman, appeared at the Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn for a pretrial conference. 
The documents also indicate that Wheeler applied to Williams College's Seaport Maritime Studies Program in Mystic, Conn. Prosecutors said that the court documents indicate Wheeler's acceptance into the Williams program, according to The Boston Globe.
The court documents also provide information about Wheeler's forged Phillips Academy in Andover transcript, which he submitted to Harvard College. Wheeler had used an identification number that belonged to an actual student at Phillips Andover.
As the investigation proceeds, the list of programs and schools that Wheeler has applied to grows longer. After his dismissal from Harvard in the fall of 2009, Wheeler applied to Yale and Brown as a transfer student, as well as to McLean Hospital for an internship in January 2010.
Wheeler's application to Brown included a forged letter of recommendation from David A. Smith, resident dean of Kirkland House, according to the documents.
On May 18, Wheeler pled not guilty to 20 counts of larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. Prosecutors allege that Wheeler, a Delaware native, submitted plagiarized letters of recommendations, fake transcripts, and fraudulent SAT scores in his transfer application to Harvard. He also allegedly submitted fraudulent documents when applying for the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships.
Wheeler, who arrived at Harvard in 2007 as a sophomore, was a resident of Kirkland House and won a Hoopes prize in his junior year for a paper that was later found to be plagiarized.
The defendant is currently being held on $5,000 bail. His hearing date is set for Aug. 9.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year in which the Harvard men’s lightweight crew tasted perfection, the Crimson simply ran into a team hitting its stride in the postseason.
Following a 10-0 dual season campaign, Harvard concluded its year with a bronze medal at the IRA National Championships this past weekend, just three weeks after falling to Princeton at Eastern Sprints. The Tigers, who couldn’t keep pace with the Crimson in the final dual meet of the season, capped the year with gold, while the Navy Midshipmen separated the two crews with a second-place showing in Saturday’s Grand Final.
But by no means did Harvard disappoint in its final race of the season. The first three quarters of the race were neck-and-neck, with Princeton taking a slim lead at 750 meters before the Crimson inched ahead just after the 1,000-meter mark. The Tigers surged ahead down the stretch, though, and Navy also found its way past the Crimson. Less than two seconds separated all three of the top boats, as Princeton set an event record in 5:36.065.
For Harvard, the bronze-medal finish represented a repeat of last year’s effort at IRA’s—the third time the Crimson has medaled at the event in four seasons.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
Three weeks ago, the Harvard heavyweight crew proved that it was the team to beat in the East. Unfortunately for the Crimson, IRA’s brought a slew of talented competitors from the opposite coast.
The Harvard varsity eight followed up its championship at Sprints by placing fourth at IRA’s on Saturday, conceding to west-coast powers Cal and Washington as well as Cornell.
“Obviously we wanted to do as well as we could,” varsity two-seat Anthony Locke said. “We were excited to race against some of the west-coast schools, which are very strong traditionally.”
The Huskies’ victory in the second varsity eight race propelled the crew to a team title, with 193 points in the Ten Eyck Trophy team-scoring formula.
The second varsity eight race also brought good results for the Crimson, as Harvard’s boat posted a third-place finish to secure fourth in the team standings with a score of 165—just two points behind the Big Red.
A strong start put Washington and the Crimson in the lead early in the 1V contest, but the Golden Bears quickly asserted themselves, pulling ahead in the second 250. Cal and the Huskies eventually separated from the rest of the competition in the third 500, with the Golden Bears’ final time of 5:23.897 missing a course record by just one-fifth of a second. Harvard crossed the line 7.2 seconds behind Cornell in a time of 5:31.106.
“We were a little disappointed with the final race,” Locke said. “We had a good first half, but the second half was not as good as we had hoped for.”
The 2V Grand Final also featured a pair of crews that left competition in the dust, but this time the Crimson came in right behind. Washington and Brown battled for the top spot, with the Huskies prevailing in an event-record 5:32.083, but Harvard also showed the resolve that has carried the crew for much of the season, as it separated from a tight rear pack to capture bronze in 5:38.789.
“The second varsity had a really, really good race,” Locke said. “I think they were pleased to beat a lot of the crews that had beaten them at Eastern Sprints.”
Both of the Crimson’s varsity four boats enjoyed even more success, cruising to a pair of victories in the Third-Level and Petite Finals. Harvard’s win in the Third-Level race was particularly emphatic, with an 11.9-second margin separating the crew from second-place Princeton.
The freshman eight also competed for Harvard, taking fifth in its race with a time of 5:41.979. But while the rookie boat did not fare as well as its counterparts, with such a young team at all levels Locke was encouraged by how much experience the Crimson gained for next year.
“Probably for us, the most important thing with such a young crew…[was] to see the standard necessary to win a national championship,” he said. “From that point of view we definitely pulled something out of the regatta. We’re very excited to try and win next year.”

Despite what his name might suggest, Yale W. Fan will be  joining the incoming class of 2014—at Harvard.
Curious, we asked Fan about his interesting name and  wise decision.
"I don't think my name is  that interesting," said Fan, who told us that "Yale" was just  phonetically close to his Chinese name, "Ye"—which is part of "shiye,"  meaning "undertaking." His parents decided that two letters was just too  short for a name (how unfortunate for this Flyby correspondent), so they added "al" in  the middle and made "Yale."
"When I introduce myself to people,  people like to ask, 'Do you want to go to Yale?'" Fan said. "I had never  really seriously considered it until this year because I had only  thought of [Yale] as a law school...and I only decided to apply to  Harvard last year."
Fan, a competitive science researcher from  Oregon, was accepted to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, among other  universities that were "similar in academics." After visiting these  three in that order, he decided on Harvard.
"I chose Harvard because it combines the different  aspects of what these schools have to offer," Fan said. "I like the  flexibility of the curriculum. It provides the opportunities to do a lot  of different things."
Other than perhaps not knowing where to sit at The  Game, as Fan told the Yale Alumni Magazine Blog, Fan doesn't foresee  many problems with telling new people his name. He too thinks it's  funny—at least, for now.
"If I constantly hear jokes about my name for four  years," Fan said, "it might not be funny anymore."
Fan  assured us that he is still a fan of Yale. We'll see about that in the  fall.
