After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Better Things” is a nearly impossible show to write about. Other shows tend to have a plot. “Better Things” does not. The episodes are a series of disparate scenes taken from everyday life. Its premise is watching the day-to-day life of a single mother, Sam Fox—played (embodied is perhaps more accurate) by a wonderful Pamela Adlon—raising three kids. With that said, it feels both obvious and derivative to call “Better Things” subtly brilliant.
Its minimalism is not the only reason that this show is brilliant—though it serves as a progressive force for television. The show is deeply intelligent because of what that modernity allows such austere narratives to do. Enjoying the Adlon and Louis C.K. co-created comedy (Drama? Dramedy? Enough with the labels.) is not a function of enjoying the broad sweeps of narrative. Instead—as narrative is pared down to the point of ludicrousness—one is implored to realize the deeply intelligent thought put into each choice by each actor and the subtle hilarity in minute moments of absurdity. It forces one to notice the details of day to day life.
However, I do recognize that “Better Things” is not for an audience that is inattentive. It is not for an audience that watches television lazily. It is certainly not for an audience that requires a cohesive narrative to remain engaged.
At times, Season One of “Better Things” became a bit too enamored with the humility of its narratives—the show simultaneously became exceptional and forgettable when it portrayed life with an excess of honesty. Despite it being a wonderfully rich exploration of childhood and motherhood, it never quite could make the mundane memorable. However, the Season Two premiere subverts some of these tendencies. “September” uses a dinner party setting as a way to make disparate small threads of the episode cohesive.
The stakes are higher too. Sam’s eldest daughter, Max (a startlingly fantastic Mikey Madison), presumably high school aged, brings her 30-something-year-old boyfriend as an unwelcome dinner guest. Her youngest daughter, Duke (an equally fantastic Olivia Edward), presumably on the precipice of middle school, is bullying girls into placing objects in their vaginas. Sam’s doing her best to be a good mother.
There is a certain audacious wonder in such an honest depiction of childhood and adolescence. Adlon is, of course, fantastic—but the show’s true joy comes from what Adlon allows each of Sam’s children to be. They are not just vehicles for the childhood tropes of rebelliousness and incorruptibility, but fully realized individuals who do both good and bad things. Max, Duke, and Frankie (Hannah Alligood) become more than repositories for adults to place their regrets about their own loss of innocence.  There is a certain autonomy to their depiction, a certain honesty about the independence of childhood. It’s the best representation of childhood that’s graced the small screen since Kiernan Shipka’s Sally Draper (“Mad Men”).
Precisely because of that—because of its honest understanding of youth—“Better Things” is richly emotional work. It evokes nostalgia for a childhood never lived. It renders love—familial love—for a family never met.
Is that enough to make good television? I hope so. This season will be a barometer for exploring how far serialized shows can go while bucking the rules of narrative. I may offer a single critique: The honest realism of “Better Things” can become tiresome. At times, “September” feels a bit too close to the experience of being at an overly long dinner party. The first season suffered from a similar syndrome. There is a certain claustrophobia of life that art is able to escape. Adlon and C.K. are stubbornly non-escapist (we only leave the scene of the party once, for a brief flashback).
Yes, there is a wild ambition to their realism. It sometimes comes at the expense of some of the best things that television can offer as art—narrative cohesiveness, surrealism, and simultaneity (among many others). Yet do not let my reservations deter you. “Better Things” is ambitiously moving the proverbial artistic needle forward through its minimalism. One day, I hope that my commentary is but the written vestige of a conservative television critic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, we believe that an essential component of a college education is what students learn from one another in face to face encounters with people who are different from themselves. We want our students to stretch beyond the familiar to question what they have taken for granted, to revisit their assumptions, to confront the unknown, to expand their world of experience and understanding. This happens in the classroom, to be sure. But our commitment to residential education, even or perhaps especially in a digital age, arises from the understanding that less structured, often serendipitous, interactions—in corridors and dining halls, in late-night conversations—make critical contributions to intellectual and personal growth.
This belief in students’ capacity to teach and to learn from one another led to the creation of Harvard’s House system. Today’s students live in an environment likely more diverse than any they have previously known. We seek to bring people together across lines of identity and experience believing they can be enriched, rather than divided, by their differences. This is a bold commitment, especially now in a moment of social fracture and conflict. But it has rarely mattered more. In a time of polarization, we seek to model the ideals and possibilities of inclusion.
The policy on single-gender social organizations announced in the spring of 2016 grew out of a recognition that the significant and growing influence of final clubs, fraternities, and sororities on Harvard’s campus threatened these fundamental values and purposes. These discriminatory and exclusionary organizations are at odds with the kind of educational experience and community our admissions processes, our House system, and our curriculum are designed to achieve. Although a succession of deans has struggled to address the many issues arising from the resulting social scene, and although College Visiting Committees have expressed increasing concern, none of the steps taken have proved effective in defending the ideals of inclusion against the incursions of discrimination and exclusion in student life. As the SGSOs have grown increasingly prominent and influential, the College has, in direct contravention of our institutional intentions, slowly been evolving into a fraternity/sorority campus. As a result, there exists a shadow social environment at the College, one that is seemingly outside its control or oversight but that nevertheless significantly—and, for too many, negatively—shapes students’ educational experience.
Several other developments at Harvard have reinforced the need to recommit ourselves to our ideal of an education rooted in the lived experience of diversity. Changes in our financial aid policy introduced a broader range of difference into our student body—in socioeconomic terms as Harvard became more affordable, but in other dimensions of race, ethnicity, religion, and geographic origins as well. These changes focused attention on the need not simply to admit students from diverse backgrounds but to ensure their full membership in Harvard student life. At the same time, a lawsuit that could ultimately be decided in the highest courts of the land has challenged our admissions policies and educational philosophy by, among other things, seeking to overturn longstanding Supreme Court precedent affirming the legality of our commitment to student body diversity. In February 2016, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences developed and unanimously endorsed a compelling statement of these ideals—ideals that are profoundly incompatible with the gender exclusionary practices of the SGSOs.
It is a time when we must act affirmatively to preserve our long held commitments and values, values which are not consistent with a community dominated by organizations that divide students into groups of likeminded individuals created out of rules and processes of discrimination and exclusion. More than three decades have passed since Harvard administrators hoped that denying SGSOs official College recognition would succeed in curtailing their activities and influence. They have instead grown only more numerous and more influential, enrolling an ever larger portion of the student body. To insist that the College can have no responsibility or authority over the structure of the environment in which students live and learn is to abandon the ideals of community we have long espoused. Confronted with strikingly similar organizations, Princeton, Yale, and others found the institutional will to act. It is past time for us to do the same. We must not abdicate our obligation to take the next step in the long, historic, and ongoing movement toward ensuring that all students are full citizens of our University, that none are denied its opportunities solely because of accident of birth. We must not abandon our ideal of the educational and humane power of diversity.
Drew G. Faust is the President of Harvard University and the Lincoln Professor of History.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past July, a faculty committee released a preliminary report recommending that the College ban students from joining all fraternities, sororities, and similar exclusionary social organizations. The policy would extend to co-ed organizations, and it would replace the existing penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
We support this recommendation, and we urge University President Drew G. Faust to do so as well. It importantly expands the discourse beyond issues of gender inequality and sexual assault to the role exclusionary social organizations play in perpetuating outdated notions of elitism, classism, and exclusivity on campus. The report rightfully highlights how these organizations impact students’ sense of belonging at Harvard, especially those who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Given the serious influence of final clubs on the daily social life of Harvard undergraduates, we see this recommendation as necessary.
However, our support does not come without reservations about the process. The composition of the committee is primarily faculty members, and they may not be close enough to student life. Although their input is welcome, the weight of the decision should rest with deans and administrators who are trained to have student social life under their purview. Moreover, as we have opined in the past, we wish it was possible for administrators to better distinguish male final clubs and sororities. If the committee seeks to combat exclusivity and foster belonging, arguably sororities can provide a supportive role by giving women a social space on campus.
Most importantly, however, although we commend the report’s emphasis on issues of belonging, Harvard has been unclear about the direction it seeks to take on social groups. While the existing penalties seek to reform such groups by promoting gender inclusivity, the new recommendations argue that the exclusivity that social groups promote merits a ban in itself, and reform is not enough. This lack of direction was particularly apparent in Crimson reporting that revealed that only seven of the 27-person committee voted in favor of the social club ban. The plurality of the group—12 members in total—voted to simply form a new committee on social groups. Given the significant impact these policies will have on the future of social life at Harvard, more clarity and transparency about the decision-making process is necessary.
Other considerations must be also taken into account should Harvard decide to implement this recommendation. Without the events that social groups provide, Harvard must commit to increasing the budget for student social life and creating better physical social spaces. Beyond Harvard social events, student organizations will continue to play a critical role in organizing social spaces for students on campus. Harvard must ensure that student organizations do not further perpetuate exclusivity in the way that exclusionary social groups have by mandating membership policies and social events that are accessible to all undergraduates.
Harvard must also look to comparable schools for better models of student social life. While the committee examined Williams College and Bowdoin College as schools that have successfully banned social groups, schools like Yale—yes, Yale—could be a better example of how Harvard might deal with its larger student body. Opening more accessible, designated party spaces similar to Yale’s nightclub, Toad’s, could foster a stronger sense of inclusion and belonging for all students.
The faculty committee is right to focus on issues of exclusivity and belonging on campus. We hope that President Faust makes a decision largely aligning with what they have recommended. Above all, we hope we can move forward in promoting an inclusive social life for all students, regardless of background.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

Chris: Day 250. The president who used the words “very fine people” to describe violent, torch-holding white supremacists, now used the words “son of a b***h” to describe courageous, black NFL athletes who use their platform to peacefully protest racial injustice. And now, the whole country loses their mind. Really? This is what it took for Tom Brady and Rex Ryan to finally oppose the man they supported and campaigned for? Seriously, this is what it took for players like Ray Lewis and LeSean McCoy to finally kneel in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick after publicly shaming him for his actions? His shaming of Senator McCain for being a Prisoner of War or his defense of our foreign enemies wasn’t enough for the ‘patriotic’ NFL owners now opposing Trump? His never-ending insults towards women, immigrants, or Muslims didn’t seem like enough reasons to abandon him, yet his attack on wealthy NFL players and owners did? Over the weekend, Trump tweeted more than 10 times about the NFL or the NBA, yet not a word about Puerto Rico, a state currently suffering without water or electricity. Amidst this tabloid madness around sports, we have completely ignored the new travel ban the administration will soon roll out, ignored the fact that his threats against North Korea were taken as a declaration of war, and somehow forgotten that his campaign is still under investigation for treasonous collusion with Russia. Once again, the media and the rest of us have been manipulated for his gain.
Jason: We all know the drill: President Trump says or does something that a substantial portion of the population finds deeply offensive, but toes the line just close enough so his supporters can find some slightly rational argument to defend or ignore his actions. For the sake of argument, let’s be generous to the lingering supporters of the president and assume they have no malicious or prejudiced motivations in continuing their devotion to him. Assuming even the best of intentions, it’s hard to see exactly what is in it for them by steadfastly maintaining their position. Trump’s entire legislative agenda has stalled. His cabinet is in free fall with the use of private emails and investigations. He loses diplomatic capital with other world leaders every time he comments on geopolitics. He’s put forward no actual economic policy other than some sort of half-baked protectionist rhetoric. The Russian investigation still dogs his legitimacy, and he’s still the most unpopular incoming president in modern history. Instead of dealing with these unpleasant realities, the president seems resolved to simply lambast his ideological enemies on Twitter and hope his bluster will distract the country, or at least his base, from realizing the magnitude of what are often viewed by the opposition as his failures.
C: As 2018 gets closer, anyone who chooses to abandon Trump should be welcomed into the opposition. However, if we don’t recognize the flaws where they exist, the opposition that we build will be no stronger than the one that fell in 2016. Ending ties to Trump’s movement means nothing if we simply do it because he finally decided to attack our group. It takes a thorough understanding of an illness to take proper precautions in the future. It takes a newfound direction to move towards a better place and not merely away from a toxic one. A movement of opposition will fall for anything if it doesn’t stand for something. It is time that, instead of exposing fragments of Trump’s true ideology every time he chooses to go after a new group of people, we uproot his ideology and appeal, replacing it with a new message of action.
J: The reality is that Trump is not failing. He is succeeding in the one thing he was elected to do: reaffirm the resentments of the white working class, go to battle (at least rhetorically) against their perceived enemies, and reinforce their self-perception as virtuous victims of a vicious system rigged against them. That’s why no criticism or insult directed at Trump ever sticks in the eyes of his base, because the president is never the direct object of the attack—they are. And there you have Trumpism in a nutshell: white identity politics under a veneer of economic nationalism and populism. In the end, the larger problem is not Trump but how he has convinced so many for so long that this vision is the best vision currently offered. If we’ve learned anything, it’s that the only solution to this issue is not to further insult these continued Trumpers and inflict deeper wounds, but rather to create a superior vision. A vision that acknowledges and speaks to the pain, economic distress, and anxiety of all Americans is the only cure that will eradicate Trumpism. We can’t continue to wait for the right scandal to permanently delegitimize Trump as a person. Instead, we must replace his ideology with a better one, or else this circus that we call a political system will limp into 2020 to possibly make Trump a two-term president. I say we start brainstorming.

University Wine Shop, a favorite stop for party hosts in the Quad, will be moving one door down in November after high rents pushed the business out of its current location.
The neighborhood wine, beer, and spirits shop has occupied its 1739 Mass. Ave storefront—located between Harvard Square and Porter Square, a convenient location for Quad-dwellers—for 30 years. Facing increasing rents at this spot, longtime owner Paul DeRuzzo made arrangements to move next door to 1737 Mass. Ave.
That storefront is currently occupied by boutique store Irish Imports, which will close this fall when its owner retires after 44 years in business.
DeRuzzo said the management company that oversees the rent had been raising rents to the point where his shop could no longer survive. The property is owned by a trust and managed by Newton-based retail firm Myer Dana and Sons.
“We’d hoped for a little more goodwill,” DeRuzzo said. “We negotiated with the management company that manages the building, and it’s somebody that we’ve known for a long time, but they seemed to think the rent here was a lot higher than it should be.”
Representatives from Myer Dana and Sons did not respond to requests for comments.
DeRuzzo said he did “all the legwork” up and down Mass. Ave to learn the average rents, but that Myer Dana wasn't persuaded to lower his rent. After DeRuzzo decided to move, the management company advertised the rent at $65 per square foot per year—almost double the rent paid by other businesses along the street, he said.
“We were going to be boxed into a corner if we didn’t make other arrangements. It’s unfortunate, but it’s what we ended up having to do,” DeRuzzo said. “Either we would have to move or go out of business.”
Lucky for loyal customers, though, University Wine Shop plans to move—just 15 yards away, but incidentally in a new zip code—over the weekend after Thanksgiving, when business tends to be slower. Despite the costs and logistical challenges of the move, DeRuzzo said there’s a silver lining.
“We’ve been in here for 30 years now and it’s been the same building and the same setup, so it’s going to be kind of like having a new store, trying to freshen things up a little bit,” he said. “Our customers won’t be walking in and seeing the same stale four walls they’ve been looking at for 30 years, so there is some good news about it too.”

Starting Friday, Harvard affiliates and passersby won’t have to strain their eyes to find stylish glasses.
Warby Parker, the popular New York-based eyeglass retailer, is set to open its doors in prime Harvard Square corner real estate September 29.
The store—located at 39 JFK St.—will be the company’s third Massachusetts location, joining a shops on Newbury St. and in the Prudential Center, with another planned opening at Boston Seaport in 2018. Newbury St. was the retailer’s first location after its flagship Manhattan shop, and the company now has 60 locations across the country.
According to a Warby Parker press release, the Harvard Square shop’s interior is designed to evoke a library, with tiled flooring, book displays filled with glasses, and a marble "reference desk" at the front to pick up orders and ask questions.
One wall is decorated with a large, colorful mural featuring eyeglasses, sunglasses, and Cambridge-inspired images created by Massachusetts-based illustrator Christopher DeLorenzo.
According to a press release, Warby Parker was founded by four friends—students at the time—who felt quality eyeglasses were too expensive. The originally online-only business aims "to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price," the company's website reads.
The Cambridge location will also have the first-ever Warby Parker Pencil Room, a corner of the store stocked with custom-designed colored pencils featuring a variety of  one-liners. All pencil proceeds will go to 826 Boston, a nonprofit writing and publishing organization that looks to help middle and high school students with their writing.
"826 is a standout organization whose work we love and are always looking to support," Warby Parker's co-founder Dave Gilboa said in a press release.
Additionally, with each pair of glasses sold, Warby Parker donates a pair to someone in need as part of the company's "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program.

Harvard’s Center for Education Policy Research commenced its public seminar series Tuesday evening with a presentation on improving learning outcomes through the use of digital alerts.
Now in its second year, CEPR’s Partnering In Education Research seminar series looks to introduce the recent education policy insights to “aspiring researchers.”
"PIER is a wonderful opportunity for the larger Harvard community to come together around issues of education research," said seminar coordinator Robert Pollard. "I think this is an exciting launch to the seminar series."
In his lecture, Kennedy School Associate Professor Todd T. Rogers presented his study of summer school students in Boston Public Schools, which revealed that sending parents automatic text messages alerting them when their child's academic performance dropped below a certain threshold led to both improvements in GPA and a reduction in failed classes. Rogers said the results indicated the importance of the “defaults” on technology adoption.
Elli Suzuki, a student at the Graduate School of Education who attended the seminar, was enthusiastic about the potential of these findings to improve education.
"I was really fascinated by how a low-cost intervention like text messages could have an effect on learning outcomes," Suzuki said.
Ed School student Diwakar Kishore said he was also impressed with the study's findings, but had some reservations about automatically enrolling parents into receiving text alerts.
"I think it's fascinating to use behavioral insights into changing patterns of behavior that have positive impacts, but I am slightly worried about the ethics of it,” Kishore said. “It might have a beneficial impact on society, but where do you draw the line? And who decides what's beneficial in what context?"
The next PIER seminar will take place on October 24 and feature Jennifer L. Jennings, a professor of Sociology and Public Affairs at Princeton University.

Seated cross-legged on the floor and armed with poster paper and colorful markers, roughly 20 students gathered at Harvard Law School Tuesday evening to scrawl messages protesting the arrival of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who is slated to speak on campus Thursday.
“The cost of education shouldn’t include sexual violence,” read one poster.
“Democracy needs public schools,” read another.
The poster-making session comes three days before DeVos’s arrival in Cambridge—and three days before a large counter-demonstration scheduled to take place at the same time. As of Tuesday, more than 1,000 people had indicated on Facebook they were “interested” in attending the protest.
DeVos will give the keynote address Thursday evening at an event titled “A Conversation on Empowering Parents” hosted by the Institute of Politics. Her speech comes roughly a week after she cancelled an Obama-era requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, known as “preponderance of the evidence,” when judging whether an accused student is guilty of sexual assault.
Harvard, which currently uses the lowest standard of proof, has said it is “reviewing” DeVos’s new Title IX guidance, but that it has no current plans to update its policy. Student activists have repeatedly condemned DeVos’s actions and called on the University to take a public stand against the Education Secretary.
Three campus activist groups—the Harvard Graduate Students Union, the Harassment/Assault Law-Student Team, and Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate-run anti-sexual assault advocacy organization—organized the postering event Tuesday. In an email announcing the session, the three groups invited students to come make posters and “plan” for Thursday’s demonstration.
The Harassment/Assault Law-Student Team and Our Harvard Can Do Better are also co-hosting that protest, titled “Stand for All Students: #StopBetsy,” along with Boston-based groups including the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance.
Our Harvard Can Do Better organizers Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 and Julia Huesa ’20 said the group began efforts to organize against DeVos shortly after her Friday decision to rescind the Obama-era rules about standard of proof.
“Betsy DeVos’s policies and statements pose threats to survivors’ rights and rights of students,” Huesa said. “We are here to organize and make sure that our voices are heard when she comes to campus Thursday.”
Goldberg said she is “really excited” for Thursday’s rally and that she feels inspired by the “huge” number of students who have said they want to participate.
She added she has been less pleased with Harvard’s response to DeVos.
“In part students are stepping up here because Harvard is failing to do so,” Goldberg said. “Harvard should be doing more to make sure that this burden doesn’t just fall on us.”
In a written statement Tuesday evening, Harassment/Assault Law-Student Team co-presidents Sarah B. Gutman and Marielle Sanchez wrote that “being silent is being complicit.”
Thursday’s protest marks the second time in two weeks that the Institute of Politics has come under fire for its invited speakers. On Sept. 15, the Kennedy School of Government withdrew an invitation for Chelsea Manning to serve as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics after high-level current and former CIA officials condemned the decision.

UPDATED: October 1, 2017 at 1:22 p.m.
Ezra F. Vogel, a sociologist who studies China and Japan, addressed a crowd of about 40 students and faculty Tuesday in a discussion of the complex relationships between the United States, Japan, and China from the early nineteenth century to present.
Government professor Susan J. Pharr, whose work focuses on Japanese politics, posed questions to Vogel about his views on the three nations’ intertwined histories. In his remarks, Vogel made the case that U.S.-Japanese relations were dependent on the relationship between Japan and China.
Vogel started his lecture by explaining how U.S. foreign policy in the Pacific shifted towards seeing Japan as an ally after the end of World War II. He reasoned that this shift occurred to counter Communist influence from China and the Soviet Union in the region.
“By inviting the emperor of Japan and getting him [to China], there was a sign that there was a crack in the western sanction wall against China,” Vogel said. He added that Japanese feelings of guilt after committing large-scale acts of violence in China pressured Japan to seek improved relations after the war.
Around the 1980s, a decline in economic growth rates in Japan opened up a space for China to become the new regional power, which accompanied a number of nationalist campaigns sponsored by the Chinese government.
Vogel applied his analysis of the history of these relationships to present-day political tensions in the Pacific. For example, Vogel said the 2010 arrest of a Chinese boat captain increased Sino-Japanese tensions, and the spread of food-borne illnesses from Chinese exports to Japan strained relations.
Bill H. Overholt, a senior fellow at the Asia Center, said he was impressed by Vogel’s “historical perspective, the degree to which he can bring the history of several centuries to bear on contemporary issues on which he is very involved.”
Victor E. Teo, an academy associate at the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, said he was pleased with the event.
“I think [Vogel] pretty much covered all the very important points,” Teo said. “One of the things that I would have liked to hear more about is him talk about how the effects of Japan’s alliance with the United States affect Sino-Japanese relations.”

University President Drew G. Faust wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis last week urging him to allow transgender individuals to serve in the military.
This summer, President Donald Trump moved to ban transgender people from serving in the armed forces, reversing an Obama-era policy. In her letter, Faust denounced the decision as discriminatory and damaging to national security.
“I believe the directive to ban transgender Americans from serving in the armed forces to be deeply offensive, misguided, and harmful, both to those being excluded arbitrarily and to our country,” Faust wrote.
In June 2016, the Obama Administration implemented a revised military policy that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military, with a scheduled rollout date of January 1, 2018. Trump’s proposed ban would halt progress on the Obama-era plan  on the basis that it “failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Department's longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources.”
Trump wrote in his memo that he would consider lifting the ban if the Secretary of Defense, after consulting the Secretary of Homeland Security, offered a “convincing” recommendation for it.
Faust also penned a letter to several U.S. Senators who oppose the ban. In the wake of Trump’s announcement, Senators John S. McCain, Jack F. Reed, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, and Susan M. Collins introduced a bill that would prevent the military from discharging transgender troops on the basis of gender identity.
Faust wrote to the four that she offered her “strong support” for the bill. She also said that she hoped other members of Congress would follow suit.
“I hope your efforts and advocacy inspire your colleagues to join you in this important fight.“ Faust wrote. “The passage of your legislation will ensure that all qualified Americans in uniform, regardless of gender identity, can continue the honorable pursuit of serving and protecting their country.”
In both letters, Faust stated that she was driven to write by her experience as the University’s president, where she had met many students who had served or planned to serve in the military. According to Faust, these students displayed “exceptional strength of character and personal courage” and sought “to create a stronger society.”
“These opportunities should be open to all,” Faust wrote.
Students at the Law School have also objected to the ban. When the U.S. Army and Air Force visited the campus to interview students, student groups HLS Lambda and Queer/Trans People of Color organized a sit-in in protest of Trump’s policies.
Since Trump won the election last year, Faust has become increasingly involved in national political issues, speaking out against Trump’s immigration policies, among other topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson spoke about police brutality and civic engagement Tuesday evening to students gathered at the Institute of Politics for National Voter Registration Day.
Mckesson came to prominence as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement and a co-founder of the police reform advocacy group Campaign Zero. In addition to his activism, McKesson produces a weekly political podcast, “Pod Save the People."
Mckesson began his talk by condemning a string of fatal police shootings of black Americans.
“I don’t know much. But I know that Anthony Lamar Smith should be alive today. Michael Brown should be alive today. Rekia Boyd, Tamir Rice—they should be alive today,” Mckesson said. “I start there because I think about the response of those situations, about the protests. And for me this is a fundamental question about what power looks like.”
Mckesson went on to commend protests in Ferguson and St. Louis, Mo., arguing that while protests are not a full solution to police brutality, they offer a place where “people can think about what the world should be like.”
Mckesson's brief appearance was part of the IOP’s efforts to ensure that every eligible Harvard student is registered to vote in the lead-up to National Voter Registration Day Tuesday. Mckesson was preceded by former Connecticut Secretary of State Miles Rapoport, who encouraged civic engagement.
Mckesson also stressed the importance of voting, urging students to use their votes to empower others.
“If you care about the country, then you will vote,” Mckesson said. “I think about hope as the idea that you can think about tomorrow as being better than today,” he added in conclusion.
Hank Sparks ’21 said he was particularly motivated by Mckesson's words.
“It’s been an honor to hear from him. I’ve been listening to his podcasts for a while, and he’s definitely one of the most amazing organizers that I have ever heard of,” Sparks said. “One thing that he mentioned is that voting isn’t the only way of building up power, about how protests, social justice, and taking to the streets are also other ways to build up power and that was really inspiring and uplifting to hear.”
Zack Steigerwald Schnall ’21, another attendee, said voter registration efforts were an “ongoing process.”
“I think the speakers were all really impassioned and moving about why it’s important to stay involved and get involved,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard filed an amicus brief last week opposing President Donald Trump’s immigration order, a legal move quickly made moot after Trump issued a new executive order replacing his previous efforts.
Filed September 18, 2017, the brief was intended for the Supreme Court before the justices cancelled a hearing on Trump’s immigration order once he replaced it.
“The Order contradicts the values that American colleges and universities have traditionally touted as benefits of studying and working here, including the freedom of religion and equality embodied in the First and Fourteenth Amendments,” the brief, signed by more than 30 schools, reads.
Trump issued his new immigration order, which indefinitely bans travel to the United States from seven countries, on Sunday. It is the president’s most recent attempt to restrict immigration into the United States: His first two orders drew repeated legal scrutiny, and several judges had blocked them before the Supreme Court decided to hear arguments on their legality.
With Sunday’s new ban, the justices cleared the case from their calendar. Both sides will submit briefs by October 5 presenting arguments about whether the Supreme Court should still decide on this case or dismiss it.
Trump’s current ban targets most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, and, unlike his previous orders, is permanent.
Harvard has repeatedly opposed Trump’s executive orders on immigration, filing a number of amicus briefs to argue that they hinder the University’s ability to attract talented scholars from across the world. Trump’s original ban temporarily prevented at least four Harvard affiliates from entering the country.
Some Harvard groups have also issued responses to the new executive order. Harvard’s International Office updated its website to offer advice to international students in light of the new ban.
Describing the ban’s aftermath as “a very fluid situation,” the message on the website urges international affiliates to consult their International Office advisers before going abroad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a strong showing at Jordan field, the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-5-1) fell to Vermont (5-4) in its last home game before the start of conference play. Finding the net on both a penalty and corner kick, the Catamounts exploited set pieces to down the Crimson on their turf.
“It’s hard to look at the scoreline and just think it’s a bad loss,” sophomore midfielder Matthew Glass said. “I think we did well. We obviously got unlucky with the red card in the second half and the PK came with that.”
This was the first meeting between the two teams since 2011, and the second ever. The Crimson offense was aggressive from the start, earning a corner kick within the first three minutes. Though the team was unable to capitalize on the set piece, the strong start indicated an offensive heavy night for Harvard and that there would be several more shots at the goal throughout the game.
However, Vermont came into the match prepared and countered. Half a minute after freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik’s corner kick, the Catamounts’ first attempt at the goal was deflected by Crimson senior goalie Kyle Parks.
For the rest of the half, Vermont and Harvard traded shots and fouls, with Vermont’s offense recording a couple more shots than its opponent. The Catamounts made some good attempts at the goal against a Crimson defense that had, over the past few games, been extremely stout. Despite the bevy of attacks, Harvard’s back line, led by Parks’ four saves, kept Vermont off the scoreboard.
Going into the second half, Harvard made a change in the back line, giving freshman goalie Matt Freese some playing time between the posts. Freese was immediately tested by Vermont, and made three saves in his first ten minutes. His time in goal was cut short, though, after a foul resulted in him being sent off in the 55th minute. Vermont scored on the resulting penalty kick, putting it up 1-0.
“The way the guys on the field responded to the goals scored against us improved a lot from the last game,” said co-captain and defender Eric Gylling.
The Crimson bounced back, and remained strong in defense and offense. Though it did not manage to find opportunities to attack, the defense was a wall. The times that the Catamounts did find shots on the goal, they were blocked or saved.
Fifteen minutes after the penalty kick, Vermont worked its way near Harvard’s goal again. A deflected shot on goal earned the visiting team a corner kick. Despite the early success in defending the Catamounts’ early set plays, Harvard’s defense faltered. The highflying ball found Vermont’s Ivar Orn Amason, who placed it in the far corner of the net.
“I think a lot of the goals we’ve been giving up are pretty fixable, but we just need to keep going out and fix those things, and get ready for the next game,” Glass said.
With nearly twenty minutes left to play, there was still time left for Harvard to mount a comeback, which it immediately set out to do. Farias and sophomore defender Gavin Baker-Greene took shots on goal three minutes after Vermont’s shot, but both attempts were blocked. The Crimson’s increased pressure kept them in Vermont’s half, and freshman midfielder and forward Paolo Belloni-Urso and Lindner-Liaw made the final attempts at getting on the scoreboard.
Though it was not the result that the team wanted, Harvard had a strong performance—something that the team can carry with it going into the second half of the season.
“We’re definitely going to work on defensive set pieces, we’ve been working on them a lot,” Glass said. “And definitely being positive, especially going into the Ivy League.”
“We're taking one thing at a time going into Ivy play, and the overall attitude we’re looking to bring is calm, relaxed, and sharp,” Gylling added. “Number one thing for us is to stay together and support each other through tough times, and keep grinding onto the next chance we get.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
That’s more like it.
A week after a stunning loss in Rhode Island, Harvard rallied to stomp Brown, 38-2, through the first three quarters of the Ivy League opener. A one-man wrecking crew by the name of T.J. Linta was the sole reason the Bears managed a respectable final score of 45-28. The junior backup quarterback guided the Bears downfield five times in the fourth quarter, throwing for three touchdowns and taking one to the house on his own.
However, it was another veteran field general who came off the bench who will provide some comfort to Harvard’s team and its fans alike heading into Week 3. Joe Viviano, shaking off the rust from his disappointing season debut, completed 11 out of 13 passes for 150 yards after spelling freshman Jake Smith in the second quarter.
Benching a veteran for a rookie realistically has one of two outcomes: either the veteran is motivated to improve and show that he belongs when he gets his next chance to take the field, or he resents his younger competitor and becomes a problem. It is safe to say that Viviano falls under the first category.
Occasionally, however, players who unexpectedly find themselves on the bench do not always fully rebound.
As a Massachusetts native, I naturally gravitated toward the New England Patriots as my football team of choice. Though I was too young to remember it, a young Tom Brady shouldered the 2001-2002 team and delivered a Super Bowl victory. Brady started the season as the understudy to eight-year veteran Drew Bledsoe, but after the Patriots started 0-2 and Bledsoe was injured, Brady led the team the rest of the way.
Bledsoe, of course, did not have a future with the Patriots given Brady’s immediate success. However, the pro-bowler went on to play five more solid seasons in the NFL with the Bills and the Cowboys.
Bledsoe is perhaps football’s version of Wally Pipp. According to baseball lore, Pipp, a Yankees first baseman in the 1920s, asked to sit one game due to a headache. In his stead was a young Lou Gehrig. I’m guessing you can figure out how that story ends for Gehrig and the Bronx Bombers. As for Pipp, all that was left in store were three more relatively anonymous seasons with the Cincinnati Reds.
Allen Iverson is another storied athlete who was famously benched, though his substitution was not motivated by poor performances, and he continued to dominate the NBA after he was reinstated to the starting five. In 2004 Iverson, who was coming off an injury, was told he would be available off the bench to avoid a large workload in his first game. Thus was born his infamous “come off the bench” rant which sports fans continue to reference to this day.
Luckily for Harvard, Viviano proved last Saturday that he was no Drew Bledsoe, Wally Pipp, or Allen Iverson, giving Murphy and his coaching staff some clarity as the Crimson heads down to Washington, D.C., to take on Georgetown this Saturday.
Viviano’s tough start to the 2017 season in Kingston, R.I., mimicked the team’s performance as a whole. Though on the surface one game appears to be too small a sample size to accurately evaluate anything, in a ten-game season it is monumental.
For example, in the marathon that is the Major League Baseball season, slow starts are easily reversed. Look no further than this year’s Cleveland Indians. On August 23, the Tribe sat at 69-56 after two consecutive losses to the Red Sox, and they were still fighting off the Twins and Royals for the AL Central division lead. A season removed from losing the World Series in seven games, expectations were certainly higher in The Rock and Roll Capital of the World.
The Indians responded by rattling off 22 consecutive wins, the most consecutive victories in Major League history. Now, Cleveland has clinched its division with October on the horizon.
In the sprint that is a football season, however, slow starts can doom a team. According to ESPN, only 12 percent of NFL teams to start 0-2 since 1990 have made the playoffs.
With six fewer games to work with in the Ivy League—technically nine fewer, as non-league contests do not count for championship standings—each game matters that much more. And Viviano and the rest of the Crimson delivered in their first real test against Brown.
Coach Tim Murphy has a reputation as a great football mind, and the timing of his quarterback switches looks like yet another brilliant sequence of moves. He made the tough call to sit a senior in the first quarter of an important Ivy League game, and he gave the veteran signal caller a chance to prove himself in that very game, all the while getting a preview of Jake Smith in a game situation.
Though one day Smith may end up as the Tom Brady to Murphy’s Bill Belichick, for now it is still Joe Viviano’s squad to lead.
