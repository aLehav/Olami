After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are technically no rules against an animated film winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the 93-year history of the Oscars, however, only three have ever received a nomination (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Up,” and “Toy Story 3”), and none have ever won. When “Wall-E” wasn’t nominated in 2008, critics began to raise questions about whether the existence of the separate “Best Animated Feature” category was inherently harmful — an implicitly degrading statement that animated films must be judged by different standards than live-action ones.
This, in some ways, is besides the point; to delve into a discussion of the Academy’s inner machinations would probably make this review about 20 times longer. But the “Best Animated Feature” category is, in many ways, symptomatic of the way many Americans view animation: as a genre, rather than as a medium. The way we associate animation with fart jokes and cheesy endings makes it difficult to think broader, to produce something mature and thoughtful like “Spirited Away” or “Your Name” — leaving us to define animated movies as “just for kids”
Pixar’s “Soul,” however, blows this definition out of the water.
The film follows Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), a middle-school band teacher who’s always dreamed of being a professional jazz pianist. On the day he finally gets his big break — literally moments after being offered the chance to play with one of the jazz greats — he falls into an open manhole and, well, dies.
What follows is a bit less realistic. Instead of proceeding to The Great Beyond like all the other souls, Joe (now an ethereal, glowing, light teal-colored soul) flees to The Great Before — the fantastical celestial plane where new souls get their personalities before proceeding to Earth. There, he meets 22 (Tina Fey), a petulant, jaded new soul who’s not all that jazzed about going to Earth, and together, they devise a plan to return Joe to his earthly body in time for his big gig.
Much like in “Inside Out” (another brainchild of director and Pixar Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter), the far-fetched premise of “Soul” is balanced by how grounded it is in the human condition. It’s okay, for instance, that Joe’s soul inhabits a therapy cat named Mr. Mittens for a good chunk of the second act, because this ultimately allows 22 to recognize the true meaning of life on Earth. And the slapstick is kept to a minimum — replaced with humor that is either very clever or uncannily mature (“Can’t crush a soul here,” 22 says as a building collapses onto a group of new souls in The Great Before. “That’s what life on Earth is for”).
The astral landscapes of The Great Before are just as lush, beautiful, and imaginative as Riley’s mind in “Inside Out.” Purple “trees” are scattered on hills of turquoise “grass” in this land of blue-green pastels and incoherent, fuzzy forms — making for a world that is dream-like in the most literal sense of the word. Particularly striking are the Counselors: the kind, gentle giants that guide new souls through The Great Before. The way they are animated to look both two-dimensional and three-dimensional (sort of like a Picasso portrait brought to life) is visually stunning: a refreshing take on CG animation from the studio that pioneered the craft.
The other half of the film is set in New York, a city that Pixar managed to make just as visually interesting as a literal astral plane. Docter achieves a frenetic, energized depiction of the city that never sleeps and the diverse people it comprises, and everything about the film — from the cinematography to the crowds animation — imbibes Joe’s New York with gritty authenticity. The contrast in scoring, too — between composer Jon Batiste’s jazzy, piano-heavy New York and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ (the duo behind “Mank” and “The Social Network”) ethereal, airy underscore to The Great Before — does more than its fair share of narrative and emotional heavy lifting.
And as beautiful as the animation and music are, the real soul (pun intended) of the film lies in its writing. It does, for the most part, follow the typical Pixar story beats, but the way it builds to its final point is masterful: scattering seemingly insignificant plot points throughout the second act, shepherding an ostensibly well-adjusted protagonist through a series of adventures, and having him discover the flaw in his thinking just as the audience does — a puzzle that the viewer assembles right alongside Joe.
The final act is a masterclass in storytelling: in particular, a four-minute sequence near the end manages to — wordlessly, sublimely, poignantly — capture the beauty of the human condition. It is an ending that feels earned, one that will not only leave the viewer (as most good films do) reflecting on their own life, but also (as not many animated films do) wondering if their child can fully grasp its meaning.
“Soul” offers a thesis on the meaning of human life — a difficult question to answer in a 200-page philosophy dissertation, much less a 104-minute animated film. And it does so with all the beauty, detail, and imagination that audiences have come to expect from Pixar. It is a good animated film (indeed, probably an Oscar-worthy one), but more importantly, it is a good film, period. And it is films like “Soul” that prove that animation isn’t just as good as live-action, but — quite often — better.
Pixar's "Soul" is available to stream on Disney+ beginning on Dec. 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five representatives of Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, a student group calling on the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry, met with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and several members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in a closed-door meeting last week.
In the meeting — which took place virtually on Dec. 16 and marked the first discussions between divest organizers and administrators in more than a year — the student activists pushed Harvard to adopt a seven-point plan released in May that calls for full disclosure and divestment of fossil fuels, according to a Divest Harvard press release.
Meeting attendees included members of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, a subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation that advises members on matters related to social responsibility in its investment decisions.
Harvard has long resisted calls to divest from the fossil fuel industry. In April, the Harvard Corporation directed the Harvard Management Company to develop a plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the University’s endowment by 2050. At the time, Divest Harvard representatives called the move “insufficient.”
Divest Harvard organizer Joseph Winters ’20-’21, who attended the meeting, said the group was encouraged by the chance to meet with administrators.
“We continue to be very concerned about the University’s climate commitments, and its continued insistence that investment in the fossil fuel industry is necessary and justifiable,” he said. “However, we are happy to have had the opportunity to engage in dialogue with them, and we look forward to an offer that they meet with us on several key issues regarding the University’s climate commitments.”
Winters said Bacow and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, who chairs the CCSR, were the most vocal administrators in the discussions.
“I think we definitely feel like it is a step forward because in the past, they have basically refused to engage in dialogue with the campaign,” Winters said. “Although we meet and we tend to disagree on many of the important points about divestment, at least they’re willing to hear us and engage in this conversation, which I think is the first step toward more meaningful action from the University.”
Jason A. Newton, a University spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement administrators were glad to facilitate a dialogue with student activists.
Newton wrote the University remains committed to exploring ways of mitigating climate change through means other than divestment.
“Members of the Corporation appreciated the opportunity to have further conversation with the students on our shared commitment to urgently address the climate crisis,” Newton wrote. “The University will continue to pursue a range of innovative efforts to advance solutions that mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change through our teaching, research, extensive campus sustainability efforts, and through Harvard Management Company’s recently announced commitments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 29, 2020 at 3:15 p.m.
The City of Cambridge and local shelters have tailored their services to try to support the city’s homeless population during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is extending into the frosty months of winter.
The global health crisis has presented new challenges for individuals experiencing homelessness in the Cambridge area, including barriers toward accessing existing services. Many of those individuals must confront two dangerous options: stay in a communal shelter and risk contracting the virus, or live outdoors, at the mercy of a Massachusetts winter.
To deal with those difficulties, local shelter coordinators and city officials alike have tried to adapt and keep up with the pressing needs of Cambridge residents experiencing homelessness.
Y2Y Harvard Square, a youth homeless shelter usually staffed by Harvard students, implemented a series of changes to its operations in light of the health crisis, according to Asjah Monroe, the shelter’s program manager.
Since the start of the pandemic, Monroe said the shelter reduced its maximum capacity to 22 guests — down from 27 — to comply with social distancing guidelines. The shelter has also implemented an “indefinite stay” policy for guests — a departure from its previous 30-day lottery system for beds.
“Now when someone gets a bed with us, they have it until they don’t need it anymore,” Monroe said. “We didn’t want to turn people out into the streets, if you will, during Covid.”
Monroe also said there have been zero cases of coronavirus among guests at Y2Y. To promote safety at the shelter and help match guests with proper resources, Y2Y directs individuals who display Covid-19 symptoms when checking into the shelter to nearby testing sites. Earlier in the pandemic, Y2Y collaborated with Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, which set up a testing site to offer free COVID-19 tests to Y2Y guests.
Despite Y2Y’s success at mitigating the spread of the coronavirus among its guests, individuals who stay in shelters are especially vulnerable to contracting the virus, according to David G. Munson, the Medical Director of Respite Programs at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program.
Munson said shelters are not conducive to social distancing since “upwards of 300” people might live in one facility. Further, Munson said shelters lack sufficient space for individuals exposed to the coronavirus to self-isolate, therefore putting other guests at risk.
Munson said shelters in Cambridge and the greater Boston area have struggled to curb coronavirus transmission.
“In sort of the peak of things in early April, we had about 40 percent of the guests of the large shelters in the city had tested positive for Covid at one time, which was pretty striking,” he said.
Harvard students circulated an online petition in the spring calling for the University to use its vacated dorms as emergency shelter space for homeless individuals in Cambridge. The University ultimately pledged $250,000 along with a matching donation from MIT to help fund an emergency shelter opened by the City of Cambridge.
The city has set in motion a series of initiatives to help people experiencing homelessness weather the coronavirus pandemic. Those include launching an emergency shelter, offering free coronavirus testing at local sites, installing public showers in Harvard Square, and opening an annual warming center at reduced capacity.
Still, fewer homeless people in Cambridge will have access to shelters this winter. As the pandemic rages, Cambridge’s homeless shelters are offering roughly 60 fewer beds in total than usual, according to according to Mark. T. McGovern, director of Cambridge Health Alliance’s Healthcare for the Homeless Program.
While Y2Y reduced its maximum capacity, student-run Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, for example, did not open at all at the start of the winter season due to health concerns.
For individuals unable to live in shelters, the closure of local businesses and indoor public spaces due to Covid-19 poses additional hurdles during the months of winter.
“The lack of indoor daytime space is going to really be tough this winter,” McGovern said. “People can’t go to the library anymore. People can’t go inside and hang out in Dunkin Donuts to get warm.”
Though the cold months ahead will pose further challenges for Cambridge’s homeless population, McGovern said he believes no one in Cambridge experiencing homelessness has died from the coronavirus.
“I've been so inspired by the way people have really pitched in, in the shelter community, to be able to protect one another,” McGovern said.
CORRECTION: December 24, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Mark T. McGovern directs the Cambridge Health Alliance. In fact, McGovern serves as director of the Cambridge Health Alliance’s Healthcare for the Homeless Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students launched a tool Friday for Georgia residents to monitor their voter registration statuses ahead of next month’s contentious Senate runoff elections in the state.
The monitoring service, VoteFlare, was the upshot of a student project in the spring 2020 course Gov 1430: “Tech Science to Save the World” taught by Government professor Latanya A. Sweeney, who also serves as the founding director of the Data Privacy Lab through Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science.
The service monitors a Georgia state website for the latest changes made to voters’ registration statuses. Voters can sign up to receive text messages, emails, or phone calls regarding updates to their voter status. VoteFlare also informs absentee voters when the state mails them their ballot and when election officials receive their ballot once cast.
“These provide a lot of comfort for voters who maybe have lost confidence in systems like [the U.S. Postal Service],” said Sumhith V. Aradhyula ’21, a student who helped launch VoteFlare.
VoteFlare saw between 50 and 100 people register with the service within the first hour of its launch, according to Sweeney.
The tool is not the first time Gov 1430 has made an impact outside of the classroom.
In 2016, Sweeney and several of her students brought attention to voter registration websites for 35 states and the District of Columbia that were vulnerable to voter identity theft. In June 2016, Sweeney cited their research while testifying on election security before Congress.
Sweeney said her class’s previous research on election security informed the creation of VoteFlare.
“Those vulnerabilities are still there,” she said. “The big question as we hit 2020 was, ‘What do we do about it?’”
During the spring semester, Sweeney’s students brainstormed how they could use technology to address voter anxiety surrounding election security.
Though students intended to implement VoteFlare in 48 states and the District of Columbia in advance of the November elections, the coronavirus pandemic upended their work. Still, they were able to pull together the project in time for the Jan. 5 Senate runoffs in Georgia, which will determine which political party secures control of the Senate.
The website's release comes after a recent lawsuit filed in federal court called on Georgia to restore roughly 200,000 names to the state’s voter registration list that were allegedly purged from voter rolls. A federal judge rejected the claims in a Dec. 16 ruling.
Students designed the tool to be user-friendly and require minimal information from participants.
“They can come back to the site and see what’s gone wrong or what the issue is, and they have time to correct it so that their vote can still move forward,” Sweeney said.
Dhruv Gupta ’20, who helped launch VoteFlare, said the tool has attracted individuals from the youngest and oldest voter demographics.
“Younger folks are often a little bit more tech savvy but are less likely to vote, and older folks are less tech savvy but more likely to vote,” he said. “So it makes sense that these are the two demographics that are leaning towards tools like VoteFlare.”
Though the site keeps voters abreast of their registration status, it does not redress incorrect registration information.
“Ultimately we’re not changing your registration in any way,” said Jinyan Zang ’13, a Ph.D. candidate in Government and Gov 1430 teaching assistant who also worked with Sweeney on the 2016 voter identity theft report. “For the user, this is a tool for them to know what’s going on and how to contact their state board of elections or local board of elections to correct any mistakes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu ’07 rolled out twelve endorsements from local government officials in early December, including two from Cambridge city councilors, to bolster her 2021 mayoral campaign.
Cambridge City Councilors Quinton Y. Zondervan and Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler praised Wu’s stances on climate and transportation issues, citing her commitment to environmental and economic justice.
Wu’s office released a 46-page plan in August outlining a series of policy steps for Boston to mitigate the effects of climate change and move toward environmental sustainability.
“The window to reverse climate change is closing quickly, and the time is now to transition to a thriving green economy and sustainable communities with a city-level Green New Deal for Boston,” Wu’s campaign website reads. “Michelle has a plan to meet the scale and urgency of need in our communities.”
Zondervan said in an interview Boston and Cambridge should join forces in the fight against climate change, and that he believes the two cities would have a productive working relationship with Wu as Boston mayor.
“I proposed a similar, smaller-scale Green New Deal taskforce for Cambridge,” Zondervan said. “I think a lot of challenges that we’re dealing with — climate change, obviously, but also housing for example — are very regional issues that no one of us can solve alone for the region.”
Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote in an emailed statement that one of the key areas in which Boston and Cambridge should cooperate is public transportation, a centerpiece of Wu’s platform.
“The Boston metro area, which includes Cambridge, has the worst traffic in the country and yet the MBTA has cut service and raised fares in the past two years,” Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote. “Having the mayor of Boston as a strong advocate for bus and bike lanes, having municipal representation in the MBTA oversight body, and a shift to fare-free public transit would be incredibly helpful for Cambridge and other cities and towns in the Boston area.”
Wu has advocated for fare-free public transit since her 2019 “Free the T” campaign, launched in response to a proposed 6.3 percent fare increase by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Zondervan said he worked with Wu on “Free the T,” recording videos at a number of train stations in the Greater Boston area.
“Free public transportation is the single biggest step we could take toward economic mobility, racial equity, and climate justice,” Wu wrote in a January 2019 op-ed in the Boston Globe.
During Wu's mayoral run, which she officially launched in September, fare-free public transit has become one of her signature campaign promises.
“Instead of fare hikes, we should be discussing bold ideas to invest in transit – bold ideas like a fare free transit system,” Wu’s website states.
Zondervan and Sobrinho-Wheeler’s shared views with Wu earned the three government officials the support of the same progressive groups. The climate change activist groups Massachusetts Sierra Club and Boston Sunrise Movement endorsed all three candidates during their respective council runs in 2019.
Wu, Zondervan, and Sobrinho-Wheeler also participated in a Harvard Yard vigil on Dec. 9 honoring essential workers lost to Covid-19 and calling on the University to better protect its frontline employees.
If elected, Wu would be the first person of color and first woman to serve as Boston’s mayor. Incumbent Mayor Martin J. Walsh has not yet announced a reelection bid, though Wu is currently opposed by fellow Boston City Councilor Andrea J. Campbell.
Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote that he is excited about the transformative nature of Wu’s candidacy.
“Her election as Mayor would represent a new direction for Boston and as the City Councillor who has received the most votes in the last election, she has a strong mandate already,” he wrote.
