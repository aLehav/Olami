While this year’s Academy Awards summarized another successful year in film for millions of viewers from around the world, this year’s nominees were unfolding a different spectacle. Although “Argo” took the top prize, the consolation of being nominated for Best Picture still remains quite the accolade for the respective artists, particularly for the brains behind “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” By acknowledging the accomplishments of low-budget filmmakers, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences fosters a stable environment and broadcasts the value of smaller productions in Hollywood.
Considering the simple fact that Hollywood has traditionally been an incredibly profitable industry, loading up a film with explosive special effects, marketable A-list talent, and a nationwide advertising campaign tends to correlate with accessibility to a vast audience. For films destined for the Red Carpet like “Argo” and “Lincoln,” this national viewership is key to attaining the necessary critical acclaim and box-office numbers to achieve a monstrous list of nominations.
But for films like “Beast of the Southern Wild,” this is simply not the case. The winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, “Beasts” had its run on the independent film circuit, specifically with art house-oriented theatres in LA and New York. For a film like “Beasts” to achieve any sort of award consideration, it must rely on word of mouth and incredible reviews, a much more daunting task. And most of the time, these independent films fail to garner the necessary momentum to make it into the expanded Best Picture category.
Although director Benh Zeitlin has enough knowledge of the industry to know that “Beasts” did not pose a serious threat to winning the Oscar, the nomination itself is nearly as large an award. When the Academy recognizes films as small as “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which had a $1.8 million budget, the Academy is essentially recognizing the fact that in today’s film industry, it does not necessarily take the backing of a major studio to produce an endearing and financially successful film.
Traditionally, the film festival circuit has been the only key outlet for the success of an independent film. Particularly for higher-key festivals like Sundance, the goal does not particularly pertain to earning awards but rather to picking up a distributor for theatre release. At Sundance, Fox Searchlight acquired the rights to “Beasts” and prepped it for a June 27th release. Weinstein Co. purchased this year’s Grand Jury Prize Winner, “Fruitvale,” a dramatic rendition of the 2009 Oakland shooting of Oscar Grant, for the meager sum of $2 million.
However, there seems to be a more recent trend rippling through Hollywood that has championed the potential profit margin of low-budget pictures. Considering the current state of the nation’s economy, studios tend to avoid rushing to production high-budget films that contain a particular bit of risk in potential box office returns. Distribution companies are now, more than ever, seeking out production companies that can consistently guarantee positive returns with quality low-budget features that have some sort of marketability. No one better epitomizes this than up-and-coming producer Jason Blum and his work for the horror genre with Blumhouse Productions.
Until 2000, Blum worked as the co-head of Acquisitions and co-Productions department at Miramax, where his primary specialty was assessing the financial potential of films. Now, he stands as the multi-millionaire CEO of Blumhouse Productions, which has the lucrative titles of “Paranormal Activity,” “Insidious,” and “Sinister,” all three of which grossed at least 2500% of their initial budgets. Blum is currently attempting to branch out to other genres with the promise of producing quality films with lower budgets and high returns. Even last weekend’s release of “Dark Skies,” one of Blumhouse Production’s underperforming pictures, generated $8.85 million in its opening weekend with a budget of $3.5 million.
The days of the importance of featuring prominent A-listers with astronomical salaries are not necessarily over, but that model is definitely battling stiff competition. Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sylvester Stallone saw this subtle transformation first hand with the crash and burn of both their action flicks “The Last Stand” and “Bullet to the Head.” Although prominent superhero flicks will still generate hundreds of millions of dollars, low-budget works that retain the art of film and the quality of story can still be appreciated.
As the Academy continues to recognize the achievements of these smaller productions, there seems to be some hope for film as studios seek out safer and safer investments. While old ideas are recycled, remade and then made into sequels time and time again, film enthusiasts derive power from the accomplishments of smaller productions. Congratulations to the accomplishments of Ben Zeitlin and “Beasts of Southern Wild” for earning a Best Picture nomination and for championing the plethora of exemplary independent films in 2012.

Myanmar has made remarkable progress in the past few years with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, party leader of the Burmese National League for Democracy, and the agreement of rebel group Karen National Union to end a half-century long civil conflict. These, plus the abolishment of media censorship, make it undeniable that the country is heading for a definitive turn-around.
Following Myanmar’s favorable reforms, this past July the U.S. loosened sanctions on the country and is continuing to do so. However, for some like leader Suu Kyi, removing only a portion of the sanctions is insufficient to further the country’s progress. While the successes the country has celebrated reflect the commendable strides it has made towards a democracy, Myanmar’s current state still mirrors much of the country’s violent history. Considering the conflicts within the Kachin State and against the Rohingya, the international community must not make further moves to ease sanctions and should instead use newly formed diplomatic relations to work towards remedying centuries of the violence that has plagued this nation.
Though the Burmese military and the Kachin Independent Army reached a ceasefire agreement in 1994, this did little to change the political climate within the Kachin region. The Burmese government, however, continued its repressive practices by barring Kachin leaders from running for political office in 2010 and postponing elections in Kachin constituencies. In July 2011, the army reportedly launched a major “military offensive,” thereby putting a definitive end to the already loosely-followed peace agreement. This violence against the Kachin continued into this year with the Myanmar military launching airstrikes beginning on Christmas Eve, an act that could be perceived as religious intolerance against a primarily Christian group living in a primarily Buddhist nation.
The Myanmar government declared yet another unilateral cease-fire this January, only to instigate more skirmishes days later. Though the government may argue that their rekindling of hostilities were done out of self-defense, it cannot deny that it has actively sought out conflict not only with the Kachin but also with other groups such as the Rohingya while doing little to remedy these national conflicts it has perpetrated.
Though the Burmese have attempted to expel the Rohingya from their territory for centuries by implementing harsh social policies against the group, in the past few decades alone this group has been subjected to several Myanmar-led anti-Rohingya campaigns. In 1982, Burma passed its Citizenship Law that unjustly rendered the Rohingya people “foreign” occupants. Due to the people’s “alien” status, they are not only unable to travel outside of the country, but they also are required to obtain permission to get married. In addition, Rohingya men are subject to forced labor which consists of working once a week on government tasks and one night on sentry duty.
These punishments not only dehumanize and stifle Rohingya freedom but also limit the duration and location of Rohingya men’s work, perpetually pushing them further down the economic ladder. With these restrictions, the Rohingya often have little means to escape the region, regretfully leaving them to face the incessant violence and corruption of Burmese forces.
Considering President Obama’s visit to Myanmar this past November and Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to the U.S. this September, it is evident that a channel of communication exists between the two countries. Nonetheless, Suu Kyi’s hopes of lifting sanctions for the purpose of removing the country from economic isolation and the hopes of trade and investment are severely misguided. First, the U.S. has already granted an aid package of $170 million and the World Bank recently approved an $80 million grant to help the country combat its humanitarian crisis.
While these sources of funding may not be as sustainable as trade, removing all sanctions will not solve the persistent problem of human rights violations, and the U.S., along with other countries, cannot cast these issues aside simply out of a self-interested aim to invest. In fact, some currently enforced trade bans such as the 2008 U.S. move to ban the trade of jades and rubies, are actually said to combat the forced labor, rape, and ethnic cleansing linked to the industries.
The actions we have seen from Myanmar would likely be described by the U.N. as crimes against humanity, which falls under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.  In 2005, each UN member state signed the “Responsibility to Protect” document, affirming that they would protect those who live within the country’s border, and intervene if this duty were not upheld. Myanmar has time and again proven that it cannot and essentially refuses to protect its people as the country itself is the perpetrator. It is for this reason that the international community must now act not by targeting economic gain but rather by working towards promoting and gaining both peace and human rights for these conflict-ridden groups.
In light of the U.S. aim to build stronger diplomatic relations with Myanmar, it must first prioritize eliminating the violent discord in the Kachin and Rakhine regions. Although Burma’s economic prospects may be alluring to the international community, the U.S. cannot free Myanmar of its restrictions until the Burmese government makes a deliberate effort to put an end to its inhuman, violent, and undemocratic practices.

In the wake of last September’s assault on the American consulate in Benghazi, the right-wing punditocracy stirred with rage, convinced that the tragic murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three colleagues was proof of an Obama administration unfit for the task of safeguarding American lives in the Middle East. Building on the fringe narrative of Obama As Malevolent Outsider, Glenn Beck speculated aloud, “This is impeachable; the president might go to prison for this one.”
Although nothing of a cheerleader for Obama administration foreign policy, I could not help but writhe with contempt over Beck’s newest outburst of on-air mania. Righteously incensed over the Benghazi boondoggle, the NATO intervention in the Libyan civil war, and the escalation of drone activity in South-Central Asia, partisan Republicans appear to have forgotten that 10 years ago, their own president sinned against America’s security on a far, far higher order.
On the backs of a white-hot, festering national trauma, a small circle within George W. Bush’s administration deceived and distorted its way to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq—launching a war for “Iraqi freedom” that would undermine America’s international legitimacy, destabilize a pivot of regional order, and bleed Treasury coffers dry to no clear positive end. As the occupation dragged out and insurgent ambitions flared, only on occasion could one expect to hear calls for genuine accountability—usually from the pacifist left—and the Bush-Cheney administration coursed, battered but protected, to the end of a second term.
A popular narrative on the Arab street and in the organizing halls of left-wing Western activists has it that the American invasion of Iraq was an immoral, neoimperial attack on a poor nation’s sovereignty. But being neither a pacifist nor an admirer of thuggish autocrats, I refuse to buy into this critique. Saddam Hussein was by far the most murderous dictator in the postcolonial Middle East; it is reasonable to argue that in a narrow sense, the Bush administration did secure “Iraqi freedom.” The Kurdish people in Iraq’s north are unambiguously safer and more prosperous than ever before. By the estimation of Christopher Hitchens, whom I admired very much for everything but his views on international relations, this is all that matters.
But even assuming the best of intentions, shattering the Iraqi state was a crime of the highest order against American interests, regional stability, and fiscal responsibility. As an 11-year-old child, my realist Republican father warned me sternly that the power vacuum in Mesopotamia would be the greatest gift America could give to Iran’s grave-faced mullahs.  In short order, this has materialized as the political reality on the ground.
Its secular Sunni despot sacked, Baghdad under U.S.-backed Nuri al-Maliki is now the province of Iran-aligned religious foundations and street militias. Despite neoconservative fantasies of a permanent base for American power projection in the Levant and the Gulf, American-trained Iraqi troops now coordinate with Damascus, delivering aid and reinforcements to the Assad regime’s Iran-aligned butchers. And while in 1996 Richard Perle and Douglas Feith reported to Benjamin Netanyahu that an ouster of Saddam Hussein would help to secure Israel within its regional sphere, the years since have seen a rise in Iranian aggression through proxy wars and nuclear grandstanding.
If the Bush administration’s war could be dismissed merely as a catastrophic policy error with devastating consequences for regional security, Americans might be able to rest easy: Separated by the enormity of an ocean from the direct impact of Old World squabbles, we tend not to feel our transcontinental mistakes too palpably. However, liberals, conservatives, leftists, or libertarians, none of us can afford to forget the tremendous price tag incurred by the Iraq engagement, estimated by Joseph Stiglitz at upwards of $3 trillion—which, unlike smaller sums spent on social programs, accrued straight to deficit and debt rolls without delivering an iota of benefit to the taxpayer. This is not the stuff of a minor, forgivable failure of intelligence. In a sane observer’s world, it is the Iraq invasion that calls for congressional interrogations and prison sentences, not the Benghazi blunder.
It would be utterly quixotic of me to suggest bringing Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, or Wolfowitz to justice—not least because they’ve somehow managed to convince the American public, against a broad expert consensus, that Iraq was somehow worth it. Ten years later, as an American-funded Iraq teeters on the brink of vacuum, we must learn from the lesson of last decade’s failed neoconservative statesmen: When it comes to foreign adventurism, it’s never as easy as it looks. And in the interest of a more prudent culture of decision-making and a more proportionate culture of accountability, we must not forgive the policymakers who criminally saddled our generation with the ghosts of their Iraq idée fixe.

In the aftermath of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, much attention has been paid to student-teacher relationships at Harvard and to the terms of collaboration policies and Administrative Board protocols. Among others, Sarah Lawrence College professor Nicolaus Mills ’60 and former Dean of Harvard College Harry R. Lewis ’68 recently presented their critical appraisals of Harvard’s predominant campus values in interviews with the Crimson, finding faults with a culture of academic overachievement, with administrative proceedings, and with the scant efforts paid by some faculty members in the teaching of undergraduates. We at The Crimson believe that it is critically important to examine the pressures exerted by extracurricular life and pre-professional attitudes on students in all extracurricular groups, including our own.
The idea that an air of excessive seriousness surrounds extracurricular pursuits here at Harvard is not an entirely new one: As early as 1957, The Crimson pointed out the growing professionalism of student groups, warning that activities taking place outside of the classroom could end up demanding more and more of the efforts and dedication of undergraduates at the severe expense of academics. “There is evidence that the leisurely quest for…constructive relaxation…has been transformed into an intense drive for the kind of competence that has always been held more characteristic of the business world,” Steven R. Rivkin ’58 wrote in the year before his graduation.
Extracurricular life at Harvard is certainly rich, but also intense, time demanding, and not insulated from pre-professional pressures. True, many of us will have been partly motivated in our extracurricular endeavors by the desire to strengthen credentials for future job or graduate school applications. In this mix of passion and aspirations, however, lay the seeds of a culture of extracurricular over-commitment, which businessman and journalist James Atlas cogently described in 2011 in an op-ed for the New York Times, in which he talked of an increase in “striving, working, doing” at colleges around the country. At its best, such a campus culture fosters entrepreneurship and hard work. At its worst, it causes students with overly hectic schedules to resort to academic shortcuts.
While there is no hard-and-fast response to the culture of over-commitment that surrounds extracurricular life at Harvard, we would like to quote the words of Harry R. Lewis, who wrote an open letter to students in 2004 about such matters: “Empty time is not a vacuum to be filled: It is the thing that enables the other things on your mind to be creatively rearranged,” Lewis wrote. “Like the empty square in the 4-by-4 puzzle which makes it possible to move the other 15 pieces around.”

Narwhals, the Arctic whales known for their long unicorn-like tusks, could be one of the first victims of climate change, science writer Todd B. McLeish said during a well-attended lecture Saturday.
Speaking at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, McLeish, a publicist for the University of Rhode Island, discussed the future of the narwhal population as detailed in his recent book, “Narwhals: Arctic Whales in a Melting World.”
Because the narwhal’s diet includes only a few different types of fish and it prefers a narrow and specific habitat, scientists expect that it will be difficult for the mammals to survive the shrinking ice caps and evolving natural environment brought on by climate change, McLeish said.
Warmer waters could also lead to a higher number of killer whales, the narwhals’ chief predator. As the ice melts, commercial fishing and oil exploration will likely expand, resulting in more competition for the narwhal’s food sources and increased disturbances to their habitat.
Although the population is currently stable, McLeish said “fifty or a hundred years certainly seem like timeframes when there will likely be some serious red flags.”
McLeish said the narwhal’s long and storied history was what first drew him to the study of the species. At the lecture, he brought up the narwhal’s role in perpetuating age-old unicorn mythology. The marine mammals have long been compared to the mythical horned-creatures, dating back to the Middle Ages, when narwhal tusks harvested from the Arctic were sold in Europe as “unicorn horns.”
According to McLeish, back then widespread belief in the magical healing powers of the tusks led to their being valued higher than gold. European royalty made drinking cups out of narwhal tusks that they believed counteracted poison. Items of royal furniture like a Danish Coronation Throne were fashioned from the tusks. The Catholic Church even ground them into a powder that it added to sacramental wine to help heal parishioners.
Caitlin E. Andrews ’16 said she most enjoyed McLeish’s “stories about his expeditions,” such as his tale of camping for multiple weeks in Greenland during the season when the country experiences 24 hours of sunlight a day.

Following months of budget battles on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama signed off on legislation Friday night to automatically reduce government spending, unleashing an unprecedented wave of cuts to funding sources that have long supported Harvard’s researchers and scientists.
The budget cuts—collectively known as sequestration—are projected to amount to $85 billion this fiscal year alone and $1.2 trillion over the coming decade. Harvard received over $650 million from Washington during the last complete fiscal year, meaning that researchers across the University will have to cope with the impact of sharply constricted federal funding in the form of both decreased availability and reduced size of federal research grants.
“The acceleration of discovery in so many fields makes this an unrivaled era in its promise for new understanding and human betterment,” said University President Drew G. Faust in a statement to The Crimson. “Yet today—at a time when our desire to ask fundamental questions is matched by our ability to answer them—these cuts threaten to undermine our ability to carry on the basic research that leads us to new frontiers of knowledge and boosts American competitiveness.”
The exact distribution of the spending cuts within specific government programs remain uncertain. But according to a report from the Office of Management and Budget, Harvard’s top two sources of research funding—the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation—are slated to face cuts of about 5 percent each. In expectation of the sequester, the NIH announced last year that it would withhold 10 percent of its promised award amount for all grants.
The government has ordered Harvard’s third top funding source, the Department of Defense, to slash spending by about 7.9 percent.
The cuts come after approximately 10 years of flattened levels of federal funding and will curtail sponsorship for ongoing as well as future research projects. Professors and scientists worry that bleak prospects for funding may both deter budding researchers from entering the field and make foreign research hubs more attractive.
To argue against funding cuts, Faust traveled to Washington this past week to meet with members of the executive department and prominent congressional representatives from both sides of the aisle. In her conversations, she emphasized the ability of scientific discovery to propel knowledge and economic growth forward.
“As I said in my meetings with lawmakers in Washington this past week, it would be worse than a tragedy to waste this moment full of promise,” Faust said in the statement. “It is our responsibility to make sure that Congress re-prioritizes investment in science as soon as possible.”
The future of federal funding remains uncertain, as some government representatives have indicated that they may work to retroactively reverse portions of the sequester, while other lawmakers view the across-the-board budget cuts as a permanent measure.

The Harvard Square Business Association has partnered with Cambridge-based technology start-up Leaf Holdings, Inc. to begin collecting in-store donations this month to help the homeless, the HSBA announced last Friday.
Customers can make credit card donations from $1 to $100 using tablets available in 15 Harvard Square businesses, including Black Ink, Brattle Square Florist, Concepts, The World’s Only Curious George Store, Market in the Square, Tistik, and The Tannery, according to Friday’s announcement. The tablets were designed and donated by Leaf Holdings.
“By working with HSBA and donating LeafPresenter tablets to Harvard Square businesses, we can make a real impact in our local community,” said Leaf CEO and founder Aron Schwarzkopf in the press release.
Providing a convenient alternative to directly donating spare money, the funds raised from the new system will be directed towards local charities, including Youth on Fire, Harvard Square Churches Meals Program, On The Rise, Bread and Jams Self Advocacy Center, CASPAR, Spare Change News, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
“I’m really an advocate of providing as many different types of opportunities for people to donate to different causes so they can do what they feel most comfortable with,” said Kelly A. Sullivan ’14, administrative director at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
She said donations from the Leaf tablets will help the shelter cover a variety of expenses, such as purchasing socks and underwear for its guests.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA, presented the initiative at the organization’s annual meeting on March 1. At the gathering she recognized the concerns raised by some businesses over panhandling that has happened in front of Harvard Square stores and restaurants in the past, but emphasized the common desire to work with the homeless rather than force them out.
“We can’t shoo away people, nor do we want to. This is an authentic urban space where everyone is welcome,” she said.
Ayala Livny, the program manager at Youth on Fire—a drop-in center for homeless youth—echoed Jillson’s remarks. She said she thinks the new initiative is a testament to the progressive and compassionate culture of Harvard Square.
“Most business districts try to get homeless folks out as quickly as they can,” Livny said. “Very few districts in the country, let alone the world, would actually be supportive of organizations working with homeless individuals.”

As the Digital Public Library of America—a new online repository for text and media sources—prepares to launch next month, faculty and administrators at the University said they hope its creation will mark the beginning of a nationwide push for open access.
According to Robert C. Darnton ’60, Harvard University librarian and one of the original visionaries behind the DPLA, the initiative is the first step towards the creation of a national digitized library that is free and open to the general public—or, as Darnton envisions, a “modern, digital Library of Alexandria.”
Though it was first envisioned at Harvard in October 2010, the DPLA has since collaborated with other schools, national public libraries, and international enterprises in an effort to expand its reach and gather support.
The DPLA will launch on April 18 with its special collections that have already been digitized, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access its treasure trove of academic articles and primary sources in one centralized location.
“[The DPLA] is ambitious, it’s helpful, it’s the leader in providing access to the cultural heritage of an entire nation,” said Peter Suber, Director of the Harvard Open Access Project—an initiative at the Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society aimed at expanding open access to research.
A push for open access has long been a trend at Harvard. In 2008, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed its first open access policy, which made  the scholarly work of Harvard faculty and researchers available through the Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard repository.
According to computer science professor Stuart M. Shieber ’81, who authored the original open access policy, over 9000 scholarly articles have been deposited to DASH since 2008.
Twenty-four universities around the world have created open access initiatives based on the Harvard model since 2008, said Suber, who is currently advising 12 other universities that are also designing open access models.
Faculty and administrators said once the DPLA launches, the new digital library will assist professors in their research and provide them with a broader audience for their publications.
According to history professor David R. Armitage, the opening of the DPLA will make a large amount of previously inaccessible historical resources, especially those focused on American history, available for teaching and research.
English department chair W. James Simpson said he thinks the DPLA will also give the humanities the public exposure more often granted to the sciences.
“I think as long as the law permits it, then open access is exactly what the humanities need,” Simpson said.
But even as the DPLA’s launch date creeps closer, Harvard is far from accomplishing its goals in terms of open access. Suber said that he is working on building the rate of deposits in the DASH and hopes that more universities will commit to open access.
Shieber said that overall he is optimistic about the future of a digital library.
“Even though we are not even close to being there, the research community and the publishing community have come to the realization that that’s where we’re headed,” Shieber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Ward 21 Democratic Party Committee, which represents residents of the Allston, Brighton, and Fenway neighborhoods, voted unanimously Saturday morning to endorse U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of Malden in his primary battle against U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of South Boston.
Markey and Lynch, as well as three Republicans, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat vacated Feb. 1 by recently appointed Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
Saturday’s caucus meeting took place at the Brighton Branch of the Boston Public Library and was attended by just 12 eligible voters. To be eligible, voters must be registered Democrats and residents of the Ward 21 polling district and must attend three meetings of the committee within a year.
State Senator Will N. Brownsberger ’78 represented the Markey campaign, and spoke extensively about Markey’s experience authoring, sponsoring, and supporting climate change legislation in Congress.
Brownsberger, who expressed his intention to run for Markey’s seat should it be vacated, also referenced Markey’s support of abortion rights in Congress in contrast to Lynch’s more socially conservative position on the issue. While Lynch has historically described himself as an antiabortion Democrat and has voted to restrict access to abortion more often than not in Congress, he has said in recent weeks that he does not support the overturning of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade.
“You have a candidate who for many years has been a strong advocate of a woman’s right to choose, and a candidate [Lynch] who, until recently, has not,” Brownsberger said.
Brownsberger was not countered by a surrogate from the Lynch campaign. Because no representative from the Lynch campaign attended the meeting, the South Boston congressman was left without a voice before the caucus and without enough support to even qualify for the endorsement ballot. As a result, Markey’s endorsement was decided by an up-or-down vote.
At the meeting, voters voiced excitement about working for Markey, drawing parallels between the campaign ahead and their experiences canvassing for former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren during her successful U.S. Senate campaign last year. The committee discussed the coordination of voter-registration efforts for the coming campaign, among other things.
In remarks after the endorsement vote, local committee chair Lauren Mattison alluded to the popularly held sentiment that in the heavily blue Commonwealth, whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be heavily favored against any of the three Republican contenders—former U.S. Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez, former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, and State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow—vying for their party’s nomination.
“It seems like the [Democratic] primary might be the more competitive election,” Mattison said. “Now that we’ve made an endorsement, we can start to do things for Ed Markey.”
But Boston City Councilor At-Large Felix G. Arroyo, who did not vote, urged the group not to color the open Senate seat blue just yet.
“Remember, Scott Brown wasn’t supposed to win, until he did,” said Arroyo, referring to the former Republican congressman who in 2010 beat Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley in a special election following the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy ‘54-’56.
Party primaries will be held on April 30, and the special election for the senate seat is scheduled for June 25. Kerry’s seat is being filled on an interim basis by William “Mo” Cowan, a lawyer and former chief of staff for Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing a rising chorus of calls to reform mental health services on campus, Harvard officials are emphasizing mental health resources and financial support systems already available to students.
On Feb. 21, an anonymous Crimson op-ed written by an undergraduate who suffers from schizophrenia sparked student conversation in dining halls, on social media websites, and over email lists about perceived problems in the availability of mental health services at Harvard. That conversation culminated in a next-day rally outside Massachusetts Hall that drew more than 150 students, including the four current and former Undergraduate Council presidents and vice presidents.
Students at the rally said they were moved by claims made by the author of the anonymous op-ed, who, facing $650 a month in antipsychotic drug costs, argued that Harvard is still not doing enough to provide adequate mental health care for students, especially for those facing emergency expenses.
“I can apply for $5,000 to study bat droppings over the summer, but there is no application to pay for the treatment that enables me to function,” the student wrote.
In an interview this past Thursday, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds described the anonymous op-ed as “concerning” and said that administrators work hard to address students’ mental health concerns. Still, she took care to highlight the resources the University already offers.
“Students have questions and they should raise those questions. I think it’s very important for students to do that. But I also think it’s important for students to understand, as fully as they possibly can, what’s actually going on on campus and what’s being provided,” Hammonds said.
This past Friday, eight days after the anonymous student’s account ran in The Crimson, Paul J. Barreira, the director of University Health Services, published his own op-ed in The Crimson. In the piece, Barreira called attention to several improvements made to Student Mental Health Services over the last decade: the addition of wellness tutors in Houses, the hiring of additional full-time psychiatrists, the doubling of outside mental health visits for students on Harvard insurance, and the addition of two full-time access coordinators to schedule initial psychiatric visits.
Barreira emphasized in his op-ed that all students are automatically enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, which covers prescription drugs and services at HUHS. He cautioned that students should carefully review the coverage provided by their own plans before electing to waive the Harvard-sponsored plan.
Even students who elect to waive enrollment in the Harvard plan are still eligible for financial support from the University in cases of unexpected medical costs, according to Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The Beneficiary Aid Program, which awarded nearly $70,000 to more than 400 different students last year, reimburses students facing emergency medical expenses at a rate equal to an individual’s overall financial aid package, according to Neal.
“A student on 90 percent financial aid likely would be awarded 90 percent of the cost of the unexpected expense,” he wrote in a statement.
The Committee on Financial Aid meets regularly throughout the year to consider requests, but students with urgent needs should alert the Financial Aid Office or a Resident Dean to expedite the process, Neal wrote.
At the rally for improved mental health care over a week ago, students and members of the UC called on the administration to hire more therapists, clarify policies governing students taking time off, and guarantee reasonable turnaround times for decisions from the Financial Aid Office, especially in emergency situations.
Despite Barreira’s op-ed, student activists involved in the newly formed “Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard” plan to continue their activism efforts and sustain the energy of the original rally, according to Coalition organizers. As of Saturday afternoon, the group had amassed nearly 300 members.
The week’s heightened interest in mental health led UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, in conjunction with the Student Mental Health Liaisons, to email undergraduates about the resources available to students.
“We want to use this moment of heightened campus interest around this issue to encourage students to continue asking questions about existing services and policies, and—most importantly—to inform students about resources should you need to seek help now or in the future,” they wrote.
Barreira plans to attend a UC-sponsored mental health town hall event on Thursday at 7 p.m. in Emerson 105. In addition, SMHL is finalizing plans for a new video project based on the popular LGBT anti-bullying series “It Gets Better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of attending back-to-school nights and parent-teacher conferences, mothers and fathers of College juniors congregated in Cambridge this past weekend for an occasion that, for many, represented the last explicitly “for parents” event of their son or daughter’s childhood.
They came for Junior Parents Weekend—two days of House Masters’ receptions, faculty presentations, student performances, dinners out in the Square, and, in some cases, a chance to flex parental muscle.
For the mother of Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14, the weekend presented a usually impossible opportunity to directly intervene in her daughter’s love life.
“My mom saw a boy who she thought was really attractive, so she got pictures of him on her phone and told me that I need to find him,” Acevedo said, adding that she found the incident more amusing than embarrassing.
Many parents said they enjoyed the opportunity to experience a day in the collegiate life of their child.
For Julianne La Smith, the mother of Megan M. Quintero ’14, that meant going to Starbucks, Quintero’s dorm room in Kirkland House, a tea at Quintero’s sorority, and a performance of the LowKeys.
For still other parents, the weekend offered a chance to get to know their child’s previously mysterious college friends.
Kristen J. Wraith ’14 said the meeting between her mother and her friends went well. Her mother, Wraith said, brought with her “a really good New York accent, which a lot of my friends were excited to hear.”
Wraith added that her mother “tries really hard not to embarrass me, and she does a pretty good job of it.”
The official events of the weekend, highlighted by a welcome address delivered by University President Drew G. Faust in Sanders Theatre, were coordinated by the Office of Student Life in collaboration with the Crimson Key Society.
Acevedo’s parents attended a career panel at the Office of Career Services, which Acevedo said led to a productive conversation about her future.
“[My parents] absolutely loved it. They were very concerned about me having my life together, and the discussion at OCS really reinforced things I’ve been saying to them and made them feel more confident about it,” she said.
But despite the OSL programming, some bucked the trend and opted to explore Harvard and the Boston area on their own.
“We looked at some of the [official] stuff, but my mom said she kind of wanted to come to see me and be my friend,” said Allison Gofman ’14, who took her mother to a Hyperion Shakespeare scene recital and to see the glass flowers at the Natural History Museum.

This weekend, when students climbed aboard Melvin Washington, Jr.’s evening shuttle bus that travels back and forth between the Yard and the Quad, they were not greeted by the customary strobe lights and thudding music, but rather an entirely party-less shuttle.
The bus, typically dubbed “the party shuttle,” has become an informal institution at the College—a weekend staple for many Quad residents. When the shuttle conspicuously did not operate this past weekend, students took notice.
In one of many emails sent over an email list for Currier House students, Wesley A. Gordon ’13 encouraged residents to protest the closing of the party shuttle by contacting Campus Services to express their discontent.
In the message, Gordon wrote that he had spoken with Washington about the closure of the party shuttle this weekend. Gordon declined to comment on the email.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement to The Crimson Wednesday that “there is currently no plan to eliminate or reconfigure the lights and music on the late night bus,” but that occasionally Transportation Services assesses the safety of its fleet.
“To that end, they are currently looking at this bus, as they periodically do, to ensure that the party elements as currently configured don’t pose any safety concerns,” Neal wrote.
Neal did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday on whether or not the party shuttle ran this past weekend.
Rumors about the possible closure of the party shuttle have concerned students at the College.
“I think it’s something people enjoy,” Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15 said. He said he would be “disappointed” if the shuttle was shut down.
Other students praised Washington and his attempt to improve the quality of student life with a party on wheels.
“The level of dedication Melvin brings to the job is unprecedented,” Nathaniel W. Donahue ’15 said. “He cares a lot about making sure people take the shuttle and making sure people get where they need to.”
Washington began operating the party shuttle in 2009 in hopes that the addition of entertainment—fun music and lighting—might entice students to take the bus rather than walk to and from the Quad.
“If you bring in some excitement the students will follow,” he said. “They seem to really enjoy it.”
Washington added that he believes Harvard students deserve to have some fun on the weekends.
“They need something after all the stuff they go through during the week,” he said.

Media mogul and billionaire philanthropist Oprah Winfrey will speak at Harvard’s 362nd Commencement in May, the University announced Monday.
“Oprah’s journey from her grandmother’s Mississippi farm to becoming one of the world’s most admired women is one of the great American success stories,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “She has used her extraordinary influence and reach as a force for good in the world, with a constant focus on the importance of educational opportunity and the virtues of serving others.”
Winfrey is best known for her nationally syndicated talk show, “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” which ended its 25-season run in 2011. The Emmy Award-winning show was broadcasted in 145 countries and reached more than 40 million viewers per week in the United States alone. The popularity of the series, which featured a total of about 28,000 guests ranging from Hollywood celebrities to American presidents, brought her into the international spotlight.
Along with her highly successful show, Winfrey—the first African-American woman billionaire—has done extensive philanthropic work, with a focus on women’s education in developing countries. Oprah’s Angel Network, a charity that Winfrey founded in 1998, has raised more than $70 million and built more than 50 schools in 13 countries around the world, according to Winfrey’s website. Winfrey has also worked to increase the safety of children, pushing for the creation of a national database of convicted child abusers through the 1993 National Child Protection Act, also known as the “Oprah Bill.”
Winfrey will speak during the Afternoon Exercises of Commencement, which will take place on May 30 at Tercentenary Theater in Harvard Yard. In the past, the University has hosted Commencement Day speakers from a wide range of backgrounds, including prominent world leaders like Kofi A. Annan and business innovators like Bill Gates.
Winfrey herself has delivered numerous commencement addresses at universities around the country, including Duke University and Stanford University. Last year, she spoke at Spelman College in Atlanta.

It was a sweet homecoming for the Harvard men’s tennis team, which celebrated its first home match in a month with a 4-3 victory over Indiana on Saturday. The No. 23 Crimson’s win improved the team to 7-4 on the season and marked its fifth win in its last six matches.
The Hoosiers (6-7) started strong on Saturday, breaking Harvard’s serve at No. 1 and No. 2 in the early going. On the third court, sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kelvin Lam scored an 8-4 doubles win to give the Crimson an early head start.
Although Harvard’s first team of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen fell 8-5, freshman Nicky Hu and senior co-captain Andy Nguyen fought back from down a break to capture their match, 8-6, and secure the doubles point for Harvard. Andy Nguyen and Hu improved their record to 6-2 in doubles play for the year.
Andy Nguyen also took control in singles, where he scored a 6-4, 6-3 win over Indiana’s Dimitrije Tasic at No. 4 to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead. He is now 7-1 in dual matches on the fourth court for the season.
But the Hoosiers were ahead in other matches, and took straight-set victories over sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri at No. 2 and Steinroeder at No. 3 to even that match at 2-2. On the first court, Denis Nguyen won the first set over the Hoosiers’ Isade Juneau 6-4, but then lost the second 1-6. In the decisive third set, he scored a 6-3 win to put Harvard ahead again.
The bottom two singles spots would decide the match for the Crimson. Hu, playing at No. 5, clinched the match for Harvard with his comeback 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 win. Lam fell in a third-set tiebreaker just after Hu’s win to seal the 4-3 Crimson victory.
On Sunday, the Crimson hosts two more matches, taking on Louisville in the morning and crosstown rival Boston University in the afternoon.

Taking the field for the first time this season, the Harvard softball team went 2-3 at the Florida Atlantic Classic.
The Crimson—fielding a young team—picked up wins against Ball State (8-5) and host Florida Atlantic (6-10), but it fell at the hands of Michigan State (9-7), Eastern Michigan (4-5), and Jacksonville (11-4).
Harvard used the weekend to test different lineups and combinations, as the team played together for the first time with the new freshman class.
Sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz started three of the five games, and freshmen Jamie Halula and Morgan Groom got one start each and pitched in relief.
“I think what we did a good job of was reading scouting reports and trying to match pitchers to lineups,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Against Michigan State] we knew a lefty-lefty matchup would be really effective. We ended up starting Gabby, which worked out really well for us because she kept us in the game.”
MICHIGAN STATE 1, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was held to only two hits in seven innings and was unable to score after singles by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz in the fourth and sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte in the seventh.
“I think the biggest thing we need to work on is becoming more of an offensive powerhouse,” said junior co-captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson. “We have good batters, but we just need to string more hits together. It’s something that will come with time.”
Starting pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz took her first loss of the season after allowing three hits in 2.1 innings of work. The Spartans’ only run came in the second, when sophomore catcher Ellie Stoffer reached on a fielding error and was singled home by freshman shortstop Destinee Luna.
HARVARD 3, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 2
Harvard held the lead for most of the game after putting the first run on the board in the bottom of the third. Del Conte singled and stole second, and she was doubled home by third baseman Kasey Lange.
The Owls came back with two in the fourth after Ruiz gave up back-to-back doubles to sophomore designated hitter Laura Mann and junior shortstop Shelby Knox.
After falling behind, 2-1, the Crimson responded with a pair in the fifth and both teams went scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a leadoff single, designated player Haley Davis advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Lantz.
Lantz moved to second on an intentional walk and came home on a Stephanie Regan single.
Ruiz picked up her second win in as many starts, allowing four hits in her first career complete game.
EASTERN MICHIGAN 3, HARVARD 1
Eagles pitcher Jenna Ignowski pitched a complete game and allowed seven hits, but Harvard struggled to string together offensive plays.
Eastern Michigan added one run in the second but did the most damage in the sixth when center fielder Courtney Nicholson reached second and was doubled home by third baseman Nellie Coquillard.
The run knocked Halula out of the game, and she was replaced by Groom, who allowed the pinch runner to advance on a wild pitch and come home on a single.
Harvard’s only run came in the top of the fifth, when Del Conte singled, stole second, and was brought home by a single by Regan.
HAVARD 7, BALL STATE 6
Sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz got the win for the Crimson, striking out one batter and allowing four earned runs in 4.1 innings of work.
The Crimson scored four in the bottom of the first off a grand slam by Gusse who went 3-for-4 on the night and stranded two runners.
Harvard added two more in the second, but the Cardinals turned it on in the top of the fourth, scoring four runs on three doubles.
Ball State tacked on another in the fifth and the seventh and had runners on second and third with two outs, but a groundout lost the Cardinals the game.
JACKSONVILLE 5, HARVARD 1
In its first game of the season, both teams were held scoreless through the first two innings, as starting pitcher Groom struck out the side in the first and did not allow a hit in the second.
The Dolphins added one in the first and two in the fourth, and Harvard responded with its only run of the game on a Lantz homer in the top of the 6th. A Jacksonville two-run jack in the bottom of the inning brought the final score to 5-1.
Brown pitched a complete game and allowed six hits and a walk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five Crimson squash players competed in this weekend’s men’s CSA Individual Championships at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., No. 2 seed junior Ali Farag was unable to defend his national title, losing in the semifinals to eventual champion No. 3 seed Amr Khaled Khalifa of St. Lawrence University. For the fourth year in a row, the national championship went to a competitor in his first season at the collegiate level.
After upsetting Princeton 5-4 in the CSA Potter Cup semifinals on Feb. 19, the Crimson lost in the title match against top-ranked Trinity, 6-3. After similarly falling in the team championship last year, Harvard was redeemed by Farag’s individual title.
“Obviously we are annoyed we lost to Trinity,” freshman Sam Goldberg said. “We think we can [win], we know we can [win]. But with the Princeton match as an example, even when Ali [Farag] lost, other people stepped up.”
Last year as a sophomore transfer student from American University in Cairo, Farag, the number one ranked junior in the world, finished the season with a perfect 16-0 record, including a 3-0 (12-10, 11-8, 11-4) victory over Columbia’s Ramnit Tandon in the finals.
This year, four Crimson players, Farag and fellow juniors Brandon McLaughlin, Nigel Koh, and Gary Power, competed in the Pool division, the top bracket at the tournament. Junior Tommy Mullaney competed for the Molloy Cup.
On the first day in Pool play, Farag won his first two matches against Michael Sunderland of Cornell in three games, 11-9, 11-9, 11-8, and Princeton’s Samuel Kang in four, 11-8, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9.  Power lost in the first round to Kang in straight sets, 13-11, 14-12, 11-8. Koh faced a similar fate in the first round, losing, 11-8, 13-11, 11-8.
McLaughlin was the only other Crimson player to win in the first round, beating Dylan Ward of Princeton 3-0, 11-2, 11-2, 11-4, to move into the round of 16. He proceeded to lose to eventual champion Khalifa in straight sets, 12-10, 11-3, 11-5.
On the second day of competition Farag got off to a rough start, dropping his first game against Rochester’s Andres Duany, 11-9, before winning three games in a row, 11-1, 11-6, 11-8. However, he was foiled in the next round against fellow Egyptian Khalifa.
The match came down to the wire, going to five games. Farag jumped out to a two-game lead, winning 11-9 and 11-3. Yet Khalifa battled back to even up the match, 11-7, 11-6. With a spot in the title match on the line, the pair battled back and forth, until Khalifa pulled away to a 13-11 victory in the fifth game. Khalifa went on to win against top-seeded Todd Harrity of Princeton 3-0 in the finals.
Although Farag was the lone member of the Crimson who remained in the championship bracket, Gary Power competed in the first round consolation quarterfinals and Brandon McLaughlin was in the second round consolation round of 16. Power dropped a 3-1  decision to Adam Perkiomaki of Rochester. McLaughlin suffered a similar fate, losing to Dartmouth’s Chris Hanson 3-1.
In the Molloy division, Mullaney was ousted in the quarterfinals by Princeton’s Vivek Dinodia in straight sets.
“As our coach always says, we are basically the same team as last year, with a few additions,” Goldberg said. “The thing that is so different about our team this year from last year, is that we are more mature.”
Harvard closes out the season as the No. 2 team in the country while claiming a share of the Ivy League title for the first time since 2006. All five of the competitors in the CSA individual championships are juniors and will return next year.
“Obviously [next year], with our captains leaving, there is going to be a different mentality, but we feel that if we can go in with the same intensity or maturity that we will be a force to be reckoned with next year,” Goldberg said. “Teams are going to be afraid to play us.”

For the twelfth time in its history, the Ramsey Cup belongs to Harvard.
On Sunday afternoon, sophomore Amanda Sobhy took her second straight women’s squash individual college national championship, defeating Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy in the final, 11-4, 11-5, 12-10.
Sobhy did not lose a game all weekend, beating Gwendoline Tilghman of Yale, Rachel Goh of Penn, Danielle Letourneau of Cornell, and Yan Xin Tan of Penn to reach the finals.
Six other Crimson women joined the top-seeded Sobhy to compete in the tournaments at Trinity this weekend. Co-captain Natasha Kingshott, 2010 individual national champion Laura Gemmell, sophomore Haley Mendez, and freshman Michelle Gemmell also competed for the Ramsey Cup.  Co-captain Sarah Mumanachit and sophomore Julianne Chu competed for the Holleran Cup.
“The freshman and sophomore classes are so strong,” Kingshott said. “They form the foundation of our team.  As an upperclassman I am just so proud to see everything they have accomplished.”
Michelle Gemmell lost her opening match of the weekend, but stormed back with four straight victories to take the first round consolation trophy with her win over Pia Trikha of Penn, 11-2, 11-9, 11-5.
“Michelle has been training really hard, and it showed [this weekend],” Sobhy said.
The freshman lost her initial match to Trinity’s Catalina Pelaez, 8-11, 9-11, 6-11. But she then beat her teammate Kingshott, Princeton’s Rachel Leizman, and Cornell’s Jaime Larid, to reach the first-round consolation finals.
“[Gemmell] had a great win against a girl that she had lost to in the Princeton match,” Kingshott said. “We were all really proud of her for getting revenge. She was really fired up for that match.”
Mendez made it to the final of the second-round consolation before losing a close match to Pelaez, 10-12, 11-5, 11-3, 10-12, 9-11.
“Haley had a great first round win,” Kingshott said. “She then lost to [El Defrawy], who lost to Amanda in the final. It was great that Haley was able to play [El Defrawy] so close in that second round match.”
Mendez won her first round match over Penn’s Haidi Lala before losing to El Defrawy. She then beat Cornell’s Jesse Pacheco and Stanford’s Pamela Chua, to reach the second-round consolation finals.
“I think Haley Mendez really stepped up,” Sobhy said. “She gave the No. 1 from Trinity a run for her money. She lost today, 11-9, in the fifth [to Trinity’s No. 2].  Haley just works so hard day in and day out.”
It was a strong day all around for the Crimson, which won the team national championship two weekends ago.
“All of the performances [this weekend] were just great,” Kingshott said.  “It is really difficult to come into this weekend and perform at your best. It is a long season so it is really impressive what all of these girls achieved in their matches.”
While some of the top performers for the Crimson were underclassmen, Harvard’s roster boasts both youth and experience.
“They come in and they are new to college squash,” Kingshott said.  “I really enjoy imparting my knowledge having played four years [of college] already.”
At the same time, the co-captain is quick to acknowledge the impressive level of play of the younger members on the team.
“They bring their own unique insight to the game because they have competed at such high levels already,” Kingshott said. “It just creates a wonderful dynamic on the team, so it is really exciting to be a part of.”
Despite facing the nation’s best players, the Crimson managed to end its season on a high note.
“The level of college squash has definitely improved over the past few years, and all the players are getting better,” Sobhy said. “It was great to see everyone play so well.”
While Sobhy was a force for Harvard at No. 1 all season long, Mendez’s and Michelle Gemmell’s strong performances displayed the depth of the Crimson’s roster.
“[Mendez and Gemmell] approached this weekend like professionals, and they are the perfect examples of athletes who are focused and determined,” Kingshott said. “It is just so gratifying to see [them] rewarded so well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off a pair of top-three finishes at last weekend’s Indoor Heptagonal Championships, the qualifying members of the Harvard track and field team headed across the river to Boston University to compete in the ECAC/IC4A Indoor Championships.
The squad’s standouts were up against stiffer competition than at Heps, which the women’s team won for the first time since 2000, but managed to turn in a number of strong individual performances. The Crimson women tallied 20 team points, which was good for 11th place, while the men finished in 18th place after recording 17 points on the weekend.
“They call ECAC’s the ‘last chance meet’ for people who are trying to qualify for nationals,” senior Mary Hirst said. “There’s not as much of a team aspect as there is at Heps.”
Senior pole vaulter Nico Weiler earned Harvard’s lone individual victory of the weekend, as he cleared 5.30 meters to take first place. The competition had a starting height of 4.80 meters, but Weiler elected to not make an attempt until the bar was set at 5.30 meters. At that point, only Connecticut junior Cory Duggan—who finished in second place—was in the competition.
Weiler cleared the height on his first attempt, and Duggan elected to wait until the bar was raised to 5.44 meters to participate. Both competitors were unsuccessful in their efforts, and Weiler was granted first place for his 5.30-meter clearance.
“I think [Weiler] is capable of some tremendously special things,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s just a phenomenal competitor.”
Despite his standout performances this season, the senior did not qualify for next weekend’s NCAA Indoor Championships.
“I think the outdoor system plays more to his strengths as a competitor—the indoor season is really just about hitting a mark,” Saretsky said.
On the women’s side, junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, who owns both the school and Ivy League record in the weight throw, took second place in the event behind Connecticut’s Victoria Flowers. Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson photography and multimedia editor, earned eight team points for the performance.
The squad’s other co-captain, senior Sydnie Leroy, also picked up points for the squad in the pole vault. Leroy, who holds the school record in the event with a mark of 3.91 meters, cleared 3.75 meters on her first attempt to earn sixth place. George Mason’s Mandissa Marshall won the event with a meet-record vault of 4.23 meters.
“[Ekechukwu and Leroy] both just stepped up tremendously this year,” Saretsky said. “The level of consistency is what’s really impressed me. Every meet, we can go out there and count on them to lead us, not just with their captaincy, but with their performances.”
Hirst, another veteran of the women’s team, nearly broke her personal-best mark in the high jump on Saturday. Hirst, who holds the fifth-best jump in school history at 1.80 meters, cleared 1.78 meters, which was good for second place, her career-best finish at the ECAC meet.
“She’s been over her best [height] from last year I don’t even know how many times,” Saretsky said. “It’s incredible how consistent she’s been this season.”
The senior was topped by Connecticut’s Ilva Bikanova, who was one of four athletes to clear 1.78 meters. Bikanova finished the competition with one fewer miss than Hirst, earning her the event crown.
“Four people finishing at one height is kind of unusual,” Hirst said. “That’s why it’s so important to have first-attempt clearances.”
Still, Hirst’s runner-up performance earned the squad eight points.
While their teammates were competing in Boston, sophomore Erika Veidis and junior Maksim Korolev were at Columbia’s Last Chance Meet, which was held at the Armory Track and Field Center in New York, N.Y. Both athletes turned in personal-best performances in their respective events.
Veidis, who has been a force in the middle distances all season long for Harvard, ran the second fastest time in Crimson history in the 800-meter, clocking in at 2:05.70. The time was good for second place at the meet, and may have earned the sophomore one of the 16 qualifying spots at the NCAA Indoor Championships. According to Saretsky, Veidis is “on the bubble,” and is awaiting the results of the women’s 800 at other premier meets this weekend.
Korolev also had a big outing in the Big Apple, running the mile in a personal-best time of 4:03.
Thus far, Ekechukwu and freshman Martina Salander, who did not compete this weekend, are the only Harvard athletes who have punched their tickets to the championship meet in Fayetteville, Ark.
“[This weekend] was a little bit more low key than last weekend, obviously,” Saretsky said. “For the most part, the athletes that were competing did an outstanding job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what would be the final meet for some Harvard seniors, a partial squad of the men’s swimming and diving team finished fourth at the ECAC Championships this past weekend at Blodgett Pool.
With some members of the team not competing because of the Ivy League Championships taking place next weekend, the Crimson finished fourth out of a field of 19 total teams.
“We were more interested in our performance as a group of Harvard guys, rather than to the other teams competing,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Given that it wasn’t our full team, we were really happy with the fourth-place finish.”
Harvard won the 200-medley relay with strong swims by junior Jack Pretto on backstroke, Wurzbacher on breaststroke, senior Ryan Cutter on butterfly, and junior Will Brophy as the freestyle anchor.
“[The four of us] were pretty excited about that race,” Brophy said. “We knew we had the guys on it to do really well and to potentially win it. When it came down to it in the finals we just stepped up.”
For seniors Wurzbacher and Cutter, the win came in the last meet of their Harvard swimming careers.
“Jack and I we really wanted to get that win for the two seniors on the relay because they have put a ton of time and effort into our team,” Brophy said. “[Jack and I] knew that relay was just really big for the seniors…and it was amazing to do it for those two because they have worked really hard and deserved it.”
The 200-medley win was only a small portion of the weekend for Pretto and Brophy. The two juniors both swam in five total finals: three relays and two individual races, which amounts to 14 total swims over the three days for each of them.
“I wasn’t feeling great the whole way, my legs were getting tired and I was starting to have trouble with my breathing,” Brophy said.  “I just tried to keep the team in mind, and I had the mentality of just doing whatever the team needed me to do this weekend.”
Brophy took home second place in the 50 freestyle, and Pretto took third in the 100-meter backstroke.
“Jack had great swims all weekend, and Brophy was really impressive, particularly in some of the relays,” Wurzbacher said. “[Pretto and Brophy] performed well across the board and really led the team.”
Freshman Robert Doles also had a standout weekend, winning the 400 individual medley and taking fourth in the 200 individual medley.
“We also had some great swims from some of our younger guys,” Wurzbacher said. “We had a lot of our freshman in there this weekend. Evan Zheng stepped up and swam on the A-relay the other night, and Robert Doles swam really well in his individual events and the medley event.”
Sophomore George Doran placed second in the three-meter dive, while sophomore Reed Snyder placed third in the 500 freestyle.
“It was a really wonderful evening and great overall weekend,” Wurzbacher said. “Just to have all our teammates here supporting us was amazing.”
While the meet served to highlight many of the young swimmers on Harvard’s team, it also was the final meet for the seniors that swam.
“Obviously, one meet can’t sum up a career,” Brophy said. “But the seniors did their best, and they have put their heart and soul into our team. I know everyone appreciates that. They have had a huge impact on the team and have led the team in a great direction.”
Just as Brophy says the seniors have had a huge influence on the team, Wurzbacher can attest to the impact the team has had on him.
“This sport and this team have meant everything to me in my four years here,” the co-captain said.  “I know I will never have another opportunity to be on a team like Harvard men’s swimming and diving again, and I am very thankful to have had this opportunity.”
The meet served as closure for these seniors, and as a time to look back on their careers at Harvard.
“Reflecting on the four years of work that all of [the seniors] have put in and all we have accomplished together just made it an overwhelming weekend,” Wurzbacher said.  “This was the last chance we had to compete and represent Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting Sunday down by 34 points to rival Princeton, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team could not complete the comeback at the Ivy Championship meet, finishing second in the Ancient Eight. Harvard finished nearly 200 points ahead of the third-place finisher, Columbia, despite taking home only one win on Sunday when freshman Kendall Crawford won the 200-yard backstroke. The win was one of two Crawford wins on the weekend, and it came with fellow swimmers freshman Danielle Lee placing fourth and senior Caroline Weaver finishing eighth.
Coach Stephanie Wriede Morowski said that the team, which set program records in the 1,650 freestyle and the 100 freestyle, had started poorly on the first day of the competition but had done better than Princeton over the weekend.
“I thought that the team did great,” Morowski said. “We didn’t get the win, but you can’t define a season by one championship meet. It was a very good team effort in losing to the champions. While Princeton was a better team, I think we outswam them the second two days after a shaky start. However, that’s sports, and we did a really good job overall.”
Morowski said that what separated this Harvard team from past squads she had coached was the chemistry in the locker room. Although all the women on the team are very different, Morowski said that the myriad personalities meshed well together.
“I think this team really believed in not only themselves but also in each other,” Morowski said. “You have 20 different personalities, and they found a way to come together. The way this team is, they are going to be great on any different day. It is stuff like a swimmer going to a diver and telling them that I believe in you. We have always had that on teams, but this team took it to a new level, and probably they think they are so different in terms of their personalities that they knew what they needed to do as a team.”
This was the 11th straight meet that the Crimson finished second to the Tigers. Harvard, which is ranked 22nd in the nation, came into the meet 7-0 against fellow Ivy League foes in dual meets but struggled out of the gate.
The team won only one race on Thursday, with senior diver Brittany Powell taking home the top spot in the one-meter diving event, but bounced back Friday with nine top-five finishes, highlighted by a 200 medley relay win over Columbia. Junior Sara Li was a consistent force for the Crimson over the weekend, earning a new program record in the 50m freestyle with her 22.46 finish and winning the 200m freestyle the following day.
“It was an awesome weekend on all fronts,” Li said. “The Ivy Championships are really cool, and we went in hoping to win it and although that didn’t happen, we stayed together and we showed incredible heart. I think this made us realize why we are proud to be a part of this team and to be part of Harvard. It was also very motivating for next year for a very young team. We are proud of how everybody supported each other this weekend.”
Morowski said that the team got away from what had made it successful during the season on the first day of the meet but by the end of the meet was able to show the technical improvements they had made during the year.
“I think that we have very good chemistry, and because [of that], they are able to relax and have fun out there,” Morowski said. “That was something that they forgot on the first day and then got back to again. Technically, I think they have gotten cleaner as the season went on, and every race they have been fixing technical little things that plagued them earlier in the season.”
Li said that the team, which she described as very competitive and close, had an intense level of focus all season that led to most of its success.
“This team is really special for sure,” Li said. “The strength of this team is really that we have strong fire in our heart. We had an unbelievable year; we have just rolled into every meet really strong, and basically at every meet we have swam well and it’s been awesome to have those successes and those championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer did it again.
After getting benched against Clarkson last weekend and sitting out Tuesday’s contest against Yale, Maschmeyer registered her second straight shutout of Dartmouth in as many days, Saturday at Bright Hockey Center. With the 4-0 win, the No. 6/7 Harvard women’s hockey team (23-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) completed its two-game sweep of the Big Green (16-10-5,11-7-4 ECAC) and will play in the ECAC semifinals next weekend.
Maschmeyer tallied 18 saves to record consecutive shutouts for the first time in her career. Friday, she stopped all 21 of Dartmouth’s attempts, her second-highest save tally in a shutout effort.
“She’s played well, she’s done well, she’s practiced hard and she’s very good when there are a lot of shots taken,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “One of the things that I think was great was that it was an up and back game—we knew it was going to be—and she was focused and she was definitely sharp.”
The Crimson defense helped Maschmeyer in the effort, thwarting the Big Green’s attempts to control the puck in the attacking zone and successfully clearing the puck from danger in times of trouble.
“I thought everybody played very well in front of her and played good defense,” Stone said.
With the Harvard defense and Maschmeyer clicking, the home team only needed a single goal to complete its seventh straight quarterfinal sweep. It didn’t take long to get it.
Just 17 seconds into the first period, junior forward Lindsey Fry got her team on the board. After skating behind Dartmouth’s net, Fry turned and shot a backhander across the Big Green’s goalie, Lindsay Holdcroft, and above her blocker for an early tally on the Crimson’s first shot of the game.
“I think the biggest thing there was just taking it in with possession,” Fry said. “Lately we’ve really been focusing on getting pucks on net and it’s really all we try to do and I was just lucky enough that it went in.”
Fry added another goal on a power play nearly two full periods later. With less than three minutes to go in the second, the junior located the puck after a save by Holdcroft and fully extended to push it back home, watching the puck get by a diving Holdcroft as Fry fell to the ice herself.
“I just happened to be in the right place at the right time and put it away,” Fry said.
Just like she did in the first game of the series, senior Kaitlyn Spurling provided a third-period insurance goal for the Crimson. With less than 10 minutes to play, Spurling gathered the puck along the boards, and curved toward the goal. Left open entering the slot, she fired a backhand past Holdcroft’s goalie to give Harvard a 3-0 advantage. The marker was Spurling’s seventh in her last seven games. She had only netted five goals in the previous 26 games this season.
The Crimson piled on seven minutes later thanks to some precise passing. On the power play after a Dartmouth tripping penalty, freshman Mary Parker sent a pass from the red line across the ice to sophomore Samantha Reber in the center of the opposite circle. Reber then passed the puck back to Parker, who was waiting at the far post to tuck it into the net, putting an exclamation point on Harvard’s victory.
“Our kids don’t quit,” Stone said. “I’m always satisfied with how hard they work so it was really good.”
Harvard’s power-play unit scored twice on four opportunities a day after converting on two of its three man advantages. Entering the tournament, the Crimson’s power-play unit was a combined 1-for-15 over the previous four games.
In its three home contests against Dartmouth this season, the Crimson outscored its visitors, 13-0. Harvard will now travel to take on second-seeded Clarkson. The game will be played in Ithaca, N.Y. because Cornell is the highest-ranked seed remaining. If the Crimson top the Golden Knights, it will move on to the tournament final, but Clarkson beat the Crimson, 3-1, in both of the two teams’ matchups thus far this year.
“Those games we are going to have win differently than we did these games,” Fry said. “We definitely owe a couple teams some big wins.”“

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It all came down to the wire. Tied at 13-13 in the match and 4-4 in the bout, freshman Jerry Chang was faced with overcoming his brother, Penn sophomore Jason Chang, in foil to give the Harvard men’s fencing team sole possession of the conference title at the Ivy Round-Robins this weekend at Gordon Indoor Track.
The Crimson (13-5, 5-0 Ivy) competed with five Ancient Eight foes on Saturday and Sunday, emerging undefeated and untied.
Jerry Chang jumped out to an early lead, 4-2, but his brother was able to close in and force a tie-breaking battle.
“Jerry is a freshman and his brother is a sophomore,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “Jerry has a bit more experience and his results were really tremendous. His brother on the other hand, was also moving well, and he had already gone through this experience before so I think things were fairly even going into the bout.”
Jerry Chang fought for the crucial touch, earning the final point to win the bout and push the match in Harvard’s favor, 14-13, enabling his team to grab its seventh Ivy crown in program history.
“He was fortunate to come out on top in the end,” Brand said. “It was quite a dramatic ending to say the least.”
For his performance in the bout, and through the entire season, Chang was one of three members of the team to earn an All-Ivy nod. The rookie was joined by fellow freshman Michael Woo and sophomore Brian Kaneshige, also foilists.
The Crimson opened the weekend with a swift takedown of Yale. Harvard fencers swept foil, 9-0, but dropped three bouts each in saber and epee.
Next up, against Columbia, the Crimson dropped two events, saber and epee to the Lions, yet posted a resounding defeat in foil, 8-1, that allowed the team to take the match, 15-12. The loss, which was dealt to Jerry Chang, was the sole contest that the foil squad, which won 17 bouts, dropped through the first day of competition.
Sophomore Alexander Ryjik was blanked by his three Columbia opponents, while junior Eric Arzoian and senior Thomas Kolasa dropped one and two bouts, respectively. In saber, Lions fencer Alen Hadzic broke a tie with junior Michael Raynis to edge the Crimson in the event, 5-4.
The second day of the event saw the Harvard squad fight to stay on top of the standings.
On Sunday, the Crimson started the day by winning all three events against Brown. The team earned seven wins in the saber and six in the foil and epee, knocking off the Bears, 19-8.
To clinch a share of the title, Harvard bested Princeton, 16-11, with a wide margin of victory in saber, 8-1, a close, 5-4, win in foil and a loss in epée, 3-6.
“Princeton is regarded as our biggest rival in fencing,” Kaneshige said. “All the wins this weekend were equally as important and equally as memorable.”
The Crimson faced the Quakers with full possession of the title on the line. Harvard dropped the saber, 7-2, with Kolasa and Ryjik picking up the sole wins in the weapon.
The Crimson reversed the decision in epee, taking the weapon, 7-2. Sophomore Peregrine Badger swept all three opponents, while Raynis and senior Ben White, who both earned second-team conference honors, each lost one bout.
Jerry Chang and his fellow epee competitors won the hard-fought matchup, 5-4, to win the Penn contest, 15-14, and claim the title for the Crimson.
The championship is the second in three years for the team.
“The team picked each other up every single moment we needed to pick each other up,” Kaneshige said. “We operated more than [just] as a team but as a group of brothers, as a band of brothers. We worked so hard every day this year to accomplish this. We were so close to winning last year and we lost.”
The team will rest for the week before taking to the piste in Queens, N.Y. for the NCAA Regional contest Mar. 10.
“I believe, again, that we have a very good lineup for the men,” Brand said. “I’m very confident that we can qualify the maximum [number of competitors] which is six. I’m very confident going into next week that we’re going to do well again.”

During the weekend’s Ivy Round Robin championships, the Harvard women’s fencing team went 4-2, finishing in third place. At the championships, held at Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track, the team won two of three matches both days. Princeton walked away with the title, going 6-0 and defeating Harvard, 19-8. Senior fencer Felicia Sun led the team in winning the epee event against the Tigers, 5-4, but the Crimson lost the saber and foil events decisively, 8-1 and 7-2, respectively.
“Our biggest rivals this weekend were definitely Columbia and Princeton,” Sun said. “All three of us had really amazing bouts against [Princeton fencer] Cat Bolen. She’s on the world team and she’s pretty frightening, but we all fenced [well] against her. I think that really shifted the Princeton team’s confidence and I think that’s what enabled us to come out on top.”
Sun went 9-5 on the weekend, garnering an All-Ancient Eight second-team nod in the process. She was joined by women’s sabreur freshman Aliya Itzkowitz, while sophomore Emma Vaggo earned a place on the first-team all-conference squad by going 16-2 on the weekend.
Sun said that it was key in the team’s performance that it knew who it was going to play. According to Sun, the familiarity that she had with her opponents was very important in helping the team prepare and shift its lineup to gain advantageous matchups.
“I think our biggest strength is probably knowing what the matchups would be,” Sun said. “The people in the Ivy League are the people who are in the top tier in the nation, so I feel like many of us have either fenced them before or grown up fencing them all our lives. So what we were able to do was deliberately put people in that we thought would be good matches against certain fencers because we know their style.”
The Crimson, which ranks eighth in the nation, bracketed the loss to Princeton on Sunady with victories against Brown (17-10) and Penn (16-11). Vaggo said that the ability of the team to support each other was key.
“I think we knew that it was going to be hard coming in,” Vaggo said. “I think we did well overall but we had some really close bouts that didn’t go our way. This weekend I think we worked really well together as a team supporting each other.”
Vaggo also said that she was proud of the play of Itzkowitz and classmate Nina van Loon and that her performances were crucial in the team’s third-place finish.
“We had two freshmen do really well this weekend, Aliya Itzkowitz and Nina van Loon,” Vaggo said. “They did a good job. They dealt with a lot of pressure with their first Ivies, but I think they did a great job and really helped the team.”
Sun said that one of the challenges with the weekend was the lack of participation by the community in coming to the meet. Sun said that she often draws on energy from the crowd and was disappointed with the turnout.
“One thing that could have been better is getting support from our friends, from the men’s team and coaches,” Sun said. “It felt like during the whole meet there [weren’t] really a lot of people. We had really close matches against Princeton and Columbia, and I feel like if we had a little more support then people would have been able to put in a lot more of their energy.”
The tournament served as a warm-up for the regional tournament next Sunday, held in New York at St. John’s University.
“Regionals is a tricky event because only two people per squad qualify for the NCAA’s and since Regionals is the NCAA qualifier, it’s really going to test our team’s strength,” Sun said. “It will be hard for our team unity because we are competing against each other but we also need to help each other. We want to be able to send two people per squad, but we’re really going to have to work a lot on mental toughness…knowing what to draw, what to fight for to perform at the same level as we practiced.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A goal from freshman attackman Devin Dwyer tied up the score, 3-3, in the opening of the third quarter, bringing Harvard men’s lacrosse (1-2) back into its game against Hofstra (3-1) on Saturday in Hempstead, N.Y.
But the Crimson failed to tally another point until the final minutes while the Pride netted seven consecutive goals to secure the win, 10-5.
Hofstra’s sophomore midfielder Mike Malave opened the scoring with an unassisted goal in the second minute of the match.
The goal was the lone point of the first quarter, but the start of a three-goal streak for the Pride heading into the second frame.
Hofstra capitalized on a man-up situation in the opening minute of the second quarter when junior midfielder Drew Coholan scored off an assist from freshman attackman Sam Llinares to bring the score to 2-0. An unassisted goal from junior attackman Torin Varn extended the Pride lead to three goals.
Hofstra’s junior ended up completing  a hat trick in the contest to lead all scorers.
“We had a rough day shooting,” Dwyer said. “The goalie made a couple good saves…but we are really going to be working on our shooting every day.”
Harvard finally put points up on the scoreboard when junior attackman Danny Eipp found the back of the net after an unassisted drive toward goal. The Crimson offense rallied and recorded two more points in the next ten minutes, the first of which came from senior midfielder Alex White, who handled an assist from Eipp in the 12th minute of the second frame.
“At the beginning of the game, we made some great stops on defense,” captain Jason Gonos said. “I think we were playing some of the best defense we’ve played all year. During halftime, we felt pretty good about our position because they scored the first goal but we felt like we made some good stops on defense, and on offense we were putting up some goals. We had shown that we could play with them and we could definitely beat them, and I still believe we can beat them, but they definitely got the best of us [today].”
Dwyer leveled the score in the first minute of play in the third quarter, but the Pride answered with seven consecutive goals to hold a comfortable lead for the remainder of the match.
“We really just needed to get possession of the ball,” Dwyer said. “We didn’t really get that much possession. They were doing a good job on defense, but once we got the ball we knew we had to slow it down a little, get the ball around, and just play our game.”
Varn finished off his hat trick with two back-to-back goals in the fifth and tenth minutes of the third frame. Coholan chipped in another goal, and Llinares executed an unassisted goal in the final 14 seconds of the frame, while the Pride was a man down.
“We had a pretty solid first and second quarter, and then in the third quarter we kind of unraveled a little bit,” Gonos said. “They started scoring some goals, they went on a little run, and we really just kind of couldn’t stop it. It kind of seemed like we were compiling errors on the offensive and defensive side, so basically they went on that run and we couldn’t really stop it.”
After two more man-up goals, Hofstra finished the game going three of six in extra-man situations, while Harvard failed to find the net in each of its four opportunities.
In the closing eight minutes, Dwyer pocketed a goal and sent an assist to Eipp who netted the final point of the contest, bringing the final score to 10-5.
“We are going to continue working on all the little things like groundballs, shooting, and watching film and learning from what we did wrong to get better,” Dwyer said.
Dwyer and Eipp tallied the most offensive points—three each—in the matchup while junior attackman Peter Schwartz and White led the Crimson in turnovers forced, creating four and three, respectively.
“We need to work on hitting our shots,” Gonos said. “Defensively, we need to make those stops when [our opponents] go on those runs. We need to make sure that we do all the little things right and come up big against those runs to get some momentum our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team was unable to open its Ivy League season on a high note as it fell to Cornell, 17-12, on Saturday afternoon at Schoellkopf Field in Ithaca.
In the loss, freshmen attackers Audrey Todd and Alexis Nicolia combined for six goals, with three apiece, providing a positive light to an otherwise disappointing game.
“I think our freshman class played well,” Nicolia said. “We all come from good high schools so we understand the pressure of college. I think we held our composure well. We don’t really play like freshmen who are nervous to do things.”
Nicolia has now scored eight goals in two games for the Crimson (0-2, 0-1 Ivy).
“I think that we’ve been making a bunch of little mistakes that are very fixable,” Nicolia said. “It’s fortunate that I was able to find the back of the net a couple times but I wish our team as a whole found the back of the net a little more.”
Todd also handed out two assists to total five points in the game. The rookie contributed two points in last week’s 18-13 loss at Stanford.
“We have a strong freshman class,” captain Micaela Cyr said. “We have a bunch of freshmen starting on offense and defense. It’s a huge transition from the high school to college game of lacrosse. It’s more physical, it’s faster [but] they’ve done well. We all have things to work on given that we lost our first two games, but they’ve stepped up and done their part.”
Cyr, a midfielder who snatched three ground balls and five draw controls, was the only other player from the Crimson to record a team-high five points, also scoring three goals and dishing out two assists.
The No. 15 Big Red (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead that Harvard was never able to recover from.
Up 8-5 heading into the intermission, Cornell pushed the lead to seven, 13-6, by scoring five goals in the first nine minutes of play after the break. During the scoring spree, Big Red sophomore attacker Lindsay Toppe—who had a game-high nine points off four goals and five assists—connected with teammates Rachel Moody and Amanda D’Amico, who both found the back of the net. Toppe also scored a goal of her own at the start of the second half, assisted by Sarah Hefner.
The Crimson answered with offensive action of its own. Cyr scored an unassisted goal before passing to Nicolia almost three minutes later, who sent the ball past Cornell goalie Courtney Gallagher. Both Gallagher and the Crimson goalies—senior Melanie Cook and sophomore Annie Meyjes—grabbed seven saves in net.
Cyr followed up with a third unassisted goal to complete a hat trick and give Harvard its ninth point. The Big Red restored the seven-point advantage, 16-9, with a D’Amico shot.
The Crimson closed the gap to four with unassisted goals by Todd and junior defender Chloe Soukas and Nicolia’s final tally. Cornell scored once more off a free-position shot with 7:17 left in the contest.
Cornell was aided by a bevy of penalty opportunities. The Crimson committed 32 fouls through the contest to the Big Red’s 14 total errors. Cornell was awarded seven free-position shots, three of which the team converted into goals.
“You always get hit or miss with the fouls,” Cyr said. “Sometimes you’re drawing the ball back when you’re down and you maybe get too aggressive. That got called against us in that sense but that’s something I think we’ll probably work on, just trying to get our body positioning there rather than going with a check.”
Harvard did lead, however, in draw controls, 17 to 14. The Crimson previously struggled in gaining possessions against the Cardinals, trailing the opponent in draw controls, 21 to 12.
“Last weekend we struggled a lot in the second half with draw controls so practice all last week we focused on getting off the line quickly and handling the ball when everyone’s clasping,” Nicolia said, “It’s great that it played out well in the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a sweet homecoming for the Harvard men’s tennis team, which celebrated its first home match in a month this weekend by capturing victories in each of its three matches. In a doubleheader on Sunday, the Crimson scored two decisive wins, taking down Louisville (8-6), 4-3, in the morning and thrashing Boston University (4-2), 6-1, in the afternoon at the Murr Center.
On Saturday, Harvard opened up the weekend with a 4-3 victory over Indiana (6-7). The No. 23 Crimson’s victories this weekend improved the team’s record to 9-4 on the season as the team has won seven of its last eight matches.
“We were very happy to come away with three wins on the weekend,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “It was a solid showing by everyone. It’s always a good weekend when we’re tested and are able to come through.”
HARVARD 6, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 1
On Sunday afternoon, Harvard was firmly in control against the Terriers despite sporting a different lineup than normal due to the weekend’s heavy workload.
In the early going, the Crimson cruised to the doubles point. The team of senior co-captain Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu, playing a spot up at No. 1, scored an 8-2 victory, and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and freshman Kelvin Lam cruised, 8-0.  Sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Conor Haughey, playing on the third court, also took home a win, 8-5.
It came just as easy for Harvard in singles. Chaudhuri, playing at No. 1, beat the Terriers’ Josh Friedman 6-1, 6-0, and sophomore Henry Steer won by the same score. Junior Brandon Seaver, playing at No. 6, was the only Crimson player to go down, as freshmen Lam and Haughey, plus Andy Nguyen, all won to provide the final 6-1 score.
“Every day, at every position, we put ourselves in an opportunity to win,” Chaudhuri said. “On different days, different people will pull it out, which makes us a very tough team to beat.”
HARVARD 4, LOUISVILLE 3
On Sunday morning, Harvard continued its winning ways and knack for winning close matches by defeating the Cardinals, 4-3.
As has been the case in many of the team’s matches this season, the match swung on the doubles point. On the first court, MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen beat Louisville’s top squad, 8-5. Although Andy Nguyen and Hu fell in a hard-fought 9-7 battle, Steinroeder and Lam made up for the defeat at No. 3, beating the Cardinals’ Austin Siegel and Michael Lippens, 9-7, for the doubles point.
In singles, Hu earned a straight-set victory at No. 5, but Steer fell on the sixth court and Andy Nguyen lost in straight sets to tie the match at 2-2.
Even though Denis Nguyen lost a three-setter at No. 1, sophomores Chaudhuri and Steinroeder came through for the Crimson. Steinroeder defeated Louisville’s Chris Simich, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, and Chaudhuri clinched the match for Harvard with a 6-4, 6-2 victory at No. 2.
Steinroeder said the team’s experience helps give it confidence in close matches.
“We’ve all been in this situation before, and in close matches we trust our teammates to pull it out for us,” he said. “Our guys seem to just find a way to win. To have this mental edge when the matches are all so close really helps.”
HARVARD 4, INDIANA 3
In Saturday’s action, Steinroeder and Lam scored an 8-4 win to give the Crimson an early head start. But the Hoosiers would quickly fight back, taking down the first team of MacMaster and Denis Nguyen, 8-5. Hu and Andy Nguyen fought back from down a break to capture their match, 8-6, and secure the doubles point for Harvard.
Andy Nguyen also took control in singles, where he scored a 6-4, 6-3 win at No. 4 to give the Crimson a 2-0 match lead. He is now 7-1 in dual matches on the fourth court this season.
But Indiana was ahead in other matches, and took straight-set victories over Chaudhuri at No. 2 and Steinroeder at No. 3 to even that match at 2-2. The match looked in doubt for the Crimson after Denis Nguyen dropped his second set, 1-6, but he came back to win the third set, 6-3. Hu, playing at No. 5, clinched the match for Harvard with a comeback 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes it just takes a turn of the calendar.
After a February in which the Harvard women’s tennis team (4-3) struggled to field a full roster due to injuries and illnesses, it started off March on the right foot.
In consecutive wins over Binghampton (3-6) and Boston College (5-1), the team dropped a total of two matchups as the now-healthy Crimson was able to put its full team on the court.
“We played phenomenally this weekend,” co-captain Hideko Tachibana said. “Everyone [played as] one and energy was really high… There was no mercy. I’m really proud of how we competed this weekend.”
HARVARD 4, BINGHAMTON 0
Against Binghampton, Harvard came out of the gates fast and never slowed up. Junior Natalie Blosser and freshman Hai-Li Kong finished off their line-three doubles opponents, 8-3, and Tachibana and fellow co-captain Kristin Norton gave the Crimson the doubles point with an 8-2 victory.
In singles, the Crimson lost only six games in the three matches that they won, with freshman Amanda Lin taking home a 6-1, 6-1 victory at line three and Blosser and Tachibana scoring easy wins at lines six and one, respectively.
Lin—who played both doubles and singles—and Norton were absent last weekend and during Harvard’s win over Boston College.
“Amanda and Kristin are some of the more energetic people on our team, so its crucial to have them out on the court cheering us on,” Tachibana said. “It was great to have them back.”
Kong concurred, saying that the strong doubles play of the pair helped stabilize the lineup during the match.
“Healthy or not, Amanda and Kristin are always loud cheerleaders for us,” Kong said. “They always pump the rest of the team up with their funny and inspirational cheers. It definitely helped to have them back on the court, especially for doubles. Having them back was crucial in helping us clinch that doubles point.”
Tachibana said that she was really proud of the team’s quick turnaround from the Friday victory to the match on Saturday. In Ivy League play, the team will play two matches a weekend against league competition and that turnaround, according to Tachibana, will be an incredibly important one to master.
“In the Ivy League it will be just as competitive, and bouncing back is a good lesson to learn,” Tachibana said. “In the Ivy League you play two matches a weekend and if you have a loss you have to be able to play the next day and have one hundred percent out there. Being able to bounce back after tough losses is something we will be able to take into the Ivy season, if we need to.”
HARVARD 5, BOSTON COLLEGE 2
On Friday, Harvard started strong in doubles, with sophomore Sylvia Li and freshman Amanda Lin taking the line-two doubles, 8-4. But the Crimson could not pull out the two other doubles matches and lost the doubles point before roaring back in singles.
Harvard took five of six singles matches, highlighted by the wins of freshman Amy He (6-0, 6-1) at the line-two position and Tachibana (6-0, 6-4) at the line-one position.
Kong fell at No. 3, but the team did not drop a set in the other five matches, winning six sets by a score of either 6-0 or 6-1.
“The team really came out strong this weekend and played really well,” Kong said. “We bounced back and really dominated this weekend.”
Tachibana said that the struggles in February, which included numerous absences by various players due to injury and sickness, have made the team stronger. The co-captain alluded to the necessity of shifting the lineup around in bringing the team closer together.
“We have definitely become more resilient as the season goes on,” Tachibana said. “We had some tough losses at the beginning and its difficult when some teammates can’t play, but the freshmen have really stepped it up cheering on everyone and looking out for people when they are sick and injured. That might not seem significant in the short run but when you look over at your partner on the court and you know she is there with you, that goes a long way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a two-day, three-game road trip, the Harvard women’s water polo team (10-4, 2-0 EIWA) stretched its winning streak to five, taking down Mercyhurst, Bucknell, and Gannon, 11-3, 13-9, and 10-5, respectively.
The wins against the Lakers and the Bison marked the beginning of division play for the Crimson, which now sits at 2-0 in EIWA contests.
The Harvard defense–headed by sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes–shutout Mercyhurst (5-5) in the first half of competition, while limiting Bucknell (3-4, 1-2) to just one goal in the final quarter of the game after going score-for-score earlier in the match.
“I think we’ve really been trying to hone in on our defense,” co-captain Aisha Price said. “It would’ve been easy for it to become high-scoring games, but we wanted to focus on keeping goals out of the back of the net.”
Dukes, with nine saves in both the matches against the Lakers and the Golden Knights and 11 against the Bison, finished the weekend with 29 saves.
HARVARD 10, GANNON 5
After two strong team performances on Saturday, the Crimson was able to close out the weekend with a dominant win over Gannon (4-3). The win came after another solid defensive effort from Harvard, which tallied nine steals on the match. The game started slowly for the Crimson, taking a close, 3-2, lead over the Knights in the first eight minutes.
But Harvard found its stride and went on a 2-1 run, securing a 5-3 halftime advantage. After a slow third period that saw both teams scoring one apiece, the Crimson widened the gap in the fourth quarter, putting four in the back of the net and only giving up one to the Knights. The win secured a perfect 3-0 weekend for Harvard and provided a confidence booster for the team moving forward in the season.
“After this weekend, I think we have some confidence,” Price said. “Everyone put forth a really good effort and we came away with three big wins.”
Freshman Charlotte Hendrix led the offense with four goals and an assist to cap the weekend at seven goals, while junior Shayna Price and freshman Yoshi Andersen netted two apiece.
“I was very proud of the team this weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We talked all week about dedicating ourselves to the defensive end of the pool…and we did a really good job of pressing and making teams have to move the ball under pressure.”
HARVARD 13, BUCKNELL 9
Following an 11-3 win over Mercyhurst that saw six different players score, the Crimson cruised to its second victory of the weekend against Bucknell, taking down the Bison, 13-9. After shutting out the Lakers in the first half, Harvard’s defense received more pressure from the Bucknell front, but was bolstered by its offense, which netted four goals in the final quarter to secure the win.
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead to begin the match, taking a 3-1 edge in the first quarter. But the Bison responded in suit, putting four in the back of the net to Harvard’s two, leaving the game on an even-playing field heading into halftime.
After intermission, the Crimson came out strong and tallied four goals in the third and fourth quarters to earn a four-goal edge over Bucknell. Harvard allowed only one goal in the final eight, a defensive effort led by Dukes, who had 11 saves.
Dukes’ performances were especially impressive given that the Crimson was playing in a shallow-deep pool, where half of the court is in traditional deep water and the other half is in shallow water, three to four feet in depth.
“[Dukes] definitely deserves a shoutout for her performance, especially given the circumstances,” Price said. “Every other quarter, she literally had to stand on the bottom of the pool, but she played so well in the deep and shallow ends.”
To match Dukes’ efforts, Aisha Price rounded out Andersen’s offensive performance, with five goals and two assists, while Hendrix and Shayna Price chipped in three goals collectively.
HARVARD 11, MERCYHURST 3
Harvard set the winning tone of the weekend in its first match against Mercyhurst, dominating the Lakers, 11-3. From the first whistle to the final buzzer, the Crimson had control of the game, netting four goals in the first and second quarters to enter halftime with an eight-point lead.
The Harvard defense, which proved to be an integral aspect of the weekend, only allowed three Lakers goals to reach the back of the net and garnered a season-high 21 steals in the match, with six from Hendrix and four from Aisha Price. Price and Molnar also recorded hat tricks on the offensive end, netting three goals apiece, while Shayna Price offered up two.
“One thing that we’ve talked about all  [year] is that the season is a stair case, we have to take it one step, one game at a time,” Minnis said. “We want to play the best water polo at the end of the season, so we can’t get too excited or complacent now…but we learned a lot about ourselves this weekend.”

We've rounded up some of this coming week's most noteworthy events. Check them out and then check The Crimson for coverage the next day.
Tuesday March 5: Harvard alumnus, New York Times columnist, and author Nicholas D. Kristof will receive the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism. Joining the ranks of past recipients such as Frank Rich, Barbara Walters, and Christiane Amanpour, Kristof will give a public address to students and faculty at 6 p.m. on Tuesday at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Tuesday March 5 and Wednesday March 6: Members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force and the Harvard and Allston communities will gather Tuesday evening to continue the discussion on Harvard's plans to relocate some campus services to 28 Travis street. Members of the Allston community are strongly opposed to the relocation and the lack of emphasis Harvard has placed on community benefits in its Master Plan for its holdings in Allston.
On Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. in the Phillips Brooks House parlor room, the conversation will proceed with a panel discussion led by Task Force Member Harry Mattison and Pallavi Kalia Mande of the Charles River Watershed Association. The event, hosted by Harvard College Student Labor Action Movement, will bring together undergraduates, students from the Graduate School of Design, SEAS affiliates, Allston community members, and neighborhood revitalization experts to discuss Harvard's broader role in Allston.
Thursday March 7: Just a week and a half after a schizophrenic student's anonymous Crimson op-ed sparked a rally outside Massachusetts Hall, a Crimson editorial, and a public response from Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira, the Undergraduate Council and Office of Student Life have scheduled an open town hall event to discuss mental health services on campus. Set for Thursday at 7 p.m. in Emerson 105, the moderated event will feature a panel of guests, including Dr. Katherine Lapierre, Chief of Student Mental Health Services, and members of Student Mental Health Liaisons. Though there will be some factual information presented by the panel, most of the time will be devoted to question and answer, according to Barreira.
CORRECTION: March 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira would serve as a member of the panel on mental health services. While Barreira will attend the town hall event, he will not participate in the panel discussion.

A bicyclist collided with an MBTA bus on Broadway Street near the Arthur M. Sackler Museum shortly after 3 p.m. on Monday.
After the collision, which occurred near the intersection of Broadway Street and Prescott Street, the bicyclist was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, but officers at the scene said that the bicyclist was not seriously injured.
Passengers who were travelling on the bus said that the collision occurred at approximately 3:10 p.m. At least three Cambridge Police Department squad cars, as well as an ambulance, the Cambridge Fire Department, and a representative of the MBTA Transit Police, responded to the incident.
Officers at the scene said that the driver of the bus did not appear to be at fault. CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello told The Crimson that a full investigation into who was at fault had yet to be completed.

Maybe it's for your SPU requirement, maybe you just drunkenly ended up in the Bio-Labs, or maybe you're like me, and you just wanted to play with chemicals. Regardless of the reason, it's happened—you're are in a lab class. Your strong verbal skills and College Board approved vocabulary won't help you here. As I like to say, science is hard. But luckily I have some tips that will make lab a little easier for us humanities concentrators.
1. Don't Cry
Don't do it; it's a waste of waterproof mascara. It's not that the hard sciences are heartless; it's just that my tears, which would have moved my government TF, did nothing to move up my lab grade.
2. F=MA
It is the golden rule of the science classes, what you say when you have no idea what the polarity a calcium molecule is or why your test tube is on fire. This magic equation will guarantee you partial credit at the very least. Trust me—this is how I passed AP Physics and my driver's test.
3. Suck Up
Not to your TF, but to that smart kid that sits next to you. Buy her Insomnia cookies, compliment her haircut, and seduce her with your lab goggles. This way, when it comes to choosing a lab partner, or blaming that toxic chemical spill on the kid behind you, you'll have someone smart on your side. If you feel guilty about mooching too much and want a more symbiotic relationship (science term!), give back to the partnership by coming up with a good lab group nickname or sharing your knowledge of F=MA.
