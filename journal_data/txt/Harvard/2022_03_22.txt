After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a foreign army invades a country, takes away their freedom of speech, and subjugates their people, it seeks not only to oppress that country’s way of life in the present, but to cause permanent and irreversible damage to its future. In the case of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion aims to do just that: To stifle the sense of nationalism and immense pride that lies at the very core of Ukrainian culture. When Putin drops bombs on kindergardens, orphanages, and universities, he intends to take away entire generations of leaders, scholars, and artists.
Putin’s unprovoked and inhumane attack relies on destroying a future world where Ukrainian artists can exist — and that is precisely why the current generation of musicians, poets, and artists from all over the world have stood up in support of Ukraine.
Russian oppression has been an ongoing facet of Ukrainian history. In the nineteenth century, it was at the hands of the Tsarist regime. Bans on using the Ukrainian language, singing Ukrainian songs, and censorship of Ukrainian customs were enforced by the penalty of death. Poets like Taras Shevchenko were resilient in the face of it all. He wrote in Ukrainian when he could not speak in it, and advocated for freedom even during imprisonment. To this day, his words “Boritesya y poboremo!” (Fight and you shall overcome) are immortalized and recited with pride by every Ukrainian student as part of their education.
Then, in the 1900s, the Soviet Union led the subjugation. While communism starved and demoralized the nation, Russian oppressors propagandized Ukrainian classrooms. Still, networks of artist communities like the Sixtiers defended national values through their art. Lina Kostenko, for example, used her poetry to advocate for freedom of artistic creativity despite the existing regime.
Now, in the 21st century, the oppressor is President Putin. Starting with Putin’s meddling in the election of President Viktor Yanukovych, the Revolution of Euromaidan in 2013 did not end with the Heavenly Hundred Heroes, contrary to common Western belief. It escalated, growing into the annexation of Crimea by Russia, and the dissection of the Donetsk and Luhansk states in the Donbas War. Ukraine would continue to be fragmented and corroded by Russia’s corrupt meddling for years to come while the world averts its eyes.
The loudest advocates for action at that time were artists. Late singer Andriy Kuzmenko of the rock band Skryabin would visit the bullet-ridden frontlines where no one else dared to venture, while organizing a benefit concert to raise funds and aid the wounded soldiers. Likewise, musicians like rock band Okean Elzy wrote entire albums dedicated to spreading the word about this continued subjugation. Songs like “Ne tvoya viyna" (“Not your war”) and “Небо над Дніпром” (“Sky over the Dnieper”) served as rallying cries that rose over the bloody Dnieper yet fell on deaf ears for the rest of the world.
Now, when the world is finally ready to accept that Ukraine’s way of life is currently — and has always been — under direct attack, artists from all over are joining to spread the message. Some Ukrainian artists are using their platforms to spread hope: Eurovision star Ruslana is using her “voice to stop this war.” Other Ukrainian artists, like the pop band BoomBox’s frontman Andriy Khlyvnyuk, are dropping everything and enlisting in the army themselves. To Khlyvnyuk, now “is not the time for playing guitars, it’s time to take the rifles.” Art festivals like the Cannes film festival are being petitioned to ban Russian submissions with the slogan "Russian culture, when used as propaganda, is toxic! Don't be an accomplice!” and Western artists including Madonna, Mila Kunis, Leonardo Dicaprio, and Victoria Beckham are donating to the cause.
Even Russian artists, who have themselves been censored, threatened, and exiled from their country, are joining the fight. Artist Pyotr Pavlensky dared to protest against the political abuse of Putin’s Russia through his exhibition artwork and ended up in jail. Boris Akunin, Russian author and critic, has publicly criticized Putin’s invasion, regardless of the previous exile such activism has caused him in the past. Russian writer and journalist Yulia Latynina is among the loudest who spread the word on Putin’s propaganda, putting her life on the line time and again to dispel her country’s political brainwashing.
Art is an outlet for expression and for change. It can never work in a framework where its message is censored or condemned. A world like that threatens every Ukrainian refugee and every Ukrainian-American. Indeed, it could undermine the future of our world as we know it. And like the many artists that have spoken out already, more people should realize these attacks are not only on one nation, but present a threat to humanity as a whole. That is why artists, most of all, are rising to organize in response.
Territorial barriers that once tore apart the country no longer mean anything to the Eastern Ukrainian towns of Kherson, Berdyansk, and Melitopol. When Russian forces try to get people in these cities to turn on their country and on their neighbors, they are met with nothing but violent resistance. Instead of dividing the nation, this invasion has done the very opposite: It has brought together the nation closer than it has been for a long time.
Ukrainian people have fought long and hard for their freedom. For the first time in centuries, they have gotten used to being free in their own country. Russia’s invasion will fail to break their spirit. The world, Putin included, has underestimated the resiliency of the Ukrainian spirit.

On March 4, Portland rapper Aminé dropped by the House of Blues as a pit stop on his “Best Tour Ever.” The tour promotes his latest album, “TwoPointFive,” that dropped last November as a sequel to his sophomore album “OnePointFive.” Donning his signature colorful beanie and graphic t-shirt, Aminé’s sunny personality radiated on stage as he vibed with the Boston crowd.
The stage featured a backdrop of various mementos dear to the rapper: the lifesize corner store Alberta’s Market, Rose Garden, a larger-than-life statue of Ollie (Aminé’s dog), the silhouette of Portland’s Broadway Bridge, and his signature Woodland Park sign featured in previous music videos like “Shimmy.” With this miniature town at his back, Aminé’s “Best Tour Ever” started off with the bangers “Mad Funny Freestyle” and “meant2b.” These upbeat bops had the crowd grooving side to side, the thrumming bass keeping tempo for Aminé’s own funky dance moves. Snippets of Spice Girls’ “Wannabe” sounded after “Spice Girls,” and Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot” after “REDMERCEDES,” highlighting the charismatic quality of Aminé’s performance.
Songs like “Shimmy” and “Ratchet Saturn Girl” had the crowd going wild, mosh pits and chants spurring on the audience while fueling Aminé’s performance. His stage presence multiplied when he belted out lyrics like “I got verses on verses, man, this shit could go all day.” However, the addition of mellow R&B jams like “OKWME” and “Compensating” balanced out the energy, preventing the show from getting over-hyped. He took time during these tender interludes to share some candid stories with his eager fans. Like the detailed narrative of his tour pants: how he wears them as his lucky charm for every show, adding in patches that represent each city along the tour. At this time — and throughout much of the concert — fans in the crowd could be heard screaming how attractive they thought Aminé was. In a call-and-response fashion, Aminé would send a cheeky smile and sing “And if you ain’t got a man, fuck with me boo.” This reciprocal love was evident in songs like “Cantu,” where Aminé stripped back the acoustics to sing the lyrics “Cause I might wanna let my hair down” acapella for his Bostonian fans.
These pivotal moments not only enriched the crowd interaction, but made for a more intimate and authentic performance.
The setlist was an amalgamation of chart-toppers and high-energy bops from Aminé’s entire discography — but the key moments in the concert were the lowkey vibes. The transition from an a capella rendition of “Caroline” to the energetic bars in “Reel It in” was smooth and natural, mimicking the parallel flows of the two albums in succession. Aminé slowed it down on the verse where his debut album “Good for You’”s “Caroline” was meant to be quick-paced, only to then speed it back up to the chorus of “Reel It In” from 2018’s “OnePointFive.” This stylistic finesse not only showed off the impressive narrative in Aminé’s discography, but also served to wind up the audience and to end the night on a high.

Kristian Matsson (aka The Tallest Man on Earth) returned to Boston at The Royale for the first time in nearly two years on March 5. Although it was his first live show in Boston since the pandemic, Matsson’s bond with his fans remains stronger than ever.
In March 2020, when the world closed its doors and began a long period of quarantine, we saw touring musicians get creative to keep live music going. Within a week of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns, John Legend broke ground on social media concerts, streaming an hour-long Instagram concert. Many musicians followed. The Tallest Man made YouTube his platform and brought full-set live streams to viewers every week for two months. Each stream revealed some of Matsson’s musical influences as he covered the likes of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Joni Mitchell. Fans of The Tallest Man saw a whole new side of the artist through his online shows. Much of The Tallest Man on Earth’s discography is played on guitar, but Matsson often played banjo, accordion, or piano versions of his original works. Throughout his streams, Matsson would reflect on his muses and his own music making process, even describing how he learned to play the guitar and banjo. On the 10-year anniversary of his popular album “The Wild Hunt,” Matsson played through each song and revealed some of his muses and playing techniques.The consistency and intimacy of his live streams were unmatched in the era of stay-at-home concerts.
When Matsson returned to the stage at the Royale in Boston, it was as though he had never left. Front row fans wore t-shirts from The Little Red Barn Show — his first in-person concert live streamed from Sweden — proving their dedication and anticipation of the show. The banjo, which made frequent appearances in his online shows, was a rare and craved feature of the show. Chants from the crowd begged for more of the jangling instrument after his five-string rendition of “Somewhere in the Mountains, Somewhere in New York.” But Matsson stuck to his meticulously crafted setlist, switching guitars nearly every song.
The Tallest Man on Earth is a one-man show. For him, switching instruments throughout the show was as critical as switching songs for giving the set incredible depth and range. Each guitar was emblematic of its allotted song since they were tuned so differently and ran through different effects. Even without a drum kit or bass, Matsson emanated rhythm and energy with his intricate picking and strumming patterns. Every moment of the performance was filled with the electric spirit of The Tallest Man as he ran back and forth, climbed chairs and speakers, and even played sliding with his back on the floor.
While the setlist highlighted The Tallest Man on Earth’s showstoppers — “King of Spain,” “Love is All,” and “The Gardener” — Matsson surveyed his entire discography in his Boston performance. Self-proclaimed to be “living aimlessly since 2020,” Matsson is giving this tour back to his fans rather than continuing the tour of his latest studio release “I Love You. It’s a Fever Dream.” This spirit couldn’t have made for a better show. As if the song choices weren’t enough to show his gratitude to his fans and the opportunity to play again in-person, Matsson was explicit in thanking and celebrating the crowd between songs.
From the moment The Tallest Man twirled onto the stage to the tune of “För sent för Edelweiss” to when he climbed atop his piano stool to conclude his encore, Kristian Matsson reminded us of the joy of celebrating live music. As long as his songs of hope and signature on-stage vitality keep coming back to Boston, we will remember that joy.

On March 11, Jay Park unveiled his new single “GANADARA” featuring the artist IU. “GANADARA” marks the first single from Park’s new label More Vision, which he established earlier this month after stepping down as CEO of AOMG and H1gher Music, labels he founded in 2013 and 2017, respectively. Alongside his new label, “GANADARA” inaugurates the next chapter of Park’s career.
A bubbly R&B duet between two lovers, “GANADARA” is sung from the perspective of each lover who struggles to communicate with the other due to a language barrier. Fittingly, its title takes from the first four consonants of the Korean alphabet. Much like the ABC song, “ganadara” is often sung by kids when learning Korean. At first listen, “GANADARA” may sound like some kind of incantation along the lines of abracadabra — not quite, but not too far off either. “Ganadara” marks the beginning of a learning process, or as connoted here, love, a feeling no less than magical. By reciting the letters, Jay Park hopes to learn more about his lover and her language.
The other lover is played by IU, a Korean singer-songwriter and actress. Both Park and IU debuted in 2008 and have grown into giants of K-pop in the last decade. Because they dominate different sectors of K-pop, many were pleasantly surprised by the way that the unexpected collaboration hinged at R&B. The piece is also just in time for White Day, a romantic holiday celebrated in Asia on March 14.
In contrast to Jay Park’s usual repertoire heavily rooted in repetitive trap beats, tender lyricism is at the heart of “GANADARA.” Following a brief guitar intro, Jay Park starts out with a melodic rap line, showcasing the softer side of his vocal range. Slow and relaxed, the underlying beat creates a comfortable landing field for Park’s signature vocal licks and runs. The first verse contains the frustrations of one lover for not being able to put his feelings into words in a language he is unfamiliar with: “Even translators don’t help,” he sings.
The chorus, consisting of seven-syllable chants, is distinct and easy to follow, just as any alphabet song. The upbeat and catchy chorus then melts into the mellower second verse featuring IU, who offers words of reaffirmation after hearing her lover’s linguistic insecurities. IU’s airy vocal quality adds to her reassuring tone as she sings “Even if it isn’t perfect, / Don’t worry, I think I know how you feel.” While the verses themselves are repetitive in melody and lyrics, many lines return with a slight syncopation and melodic variations that diversify the sound. As a result, the song maintains both its sing-along and impromptu qualities.
One of the most refreshing elements of the song is its playfulness, which was enhanced by the music video that accompanied its release. Comic and light-hearted, the video consists of a story within a story showing the behind the scenes of Jay Park and IU’s collaboration. The skit brings to life the chemistry between the two artists and has garnered heated attention on social media. Additionally, the song is studded by amusing ad-libs, including IU’s real laughter that was left in the recording post-production.
Beyond just language barriers, larger themes of communication and empathy thread the piece and provide food for thought on relationships in general. Connection, romantic or not, takes more than spoken words; some emotions transcend language. In a sense, love itself is like learning a language: it requires all parties to take on a learner’s mindset, wipe away all preconceptions, and start from the very basics — namely, the ABC's, or “GANADARA.”

When Megan Thee Stallion and Dua Lipa — two of the world’s most popular artists right now — team up for a song, it seems fair to conclude that it’ll be a guaranteed hit. Unfortunately, their flirtatious new single “Sweetest Pie,” which was released on streaming services March 11, proves this assumption wrong. The pop anthem has its moments that are sure to please, but it ultimately suffers from generic, forgettable melodies.
The song begins by jumping into Dua Lipa’s chorus, which also happens to be the song’s strongest point. The upbeat tone, electric bass, and occasional chimes keep this chorus buoyant and airy Dua Lipa also adds some satisfying vocal flourishes to the tune, stretching out a few words while hitting high notes.
Megan Thee Stallion follows this chorus with a rap verse whose passionate delivery cannot save it from sounding much like many of her other works. Listeners who are familiar with some of Stallion’s other songs, such as “Thot Shit,” “WAP,” or “Butter (Remix),” will find her performance in this song largely underwhelming. The uninspired flow and predictable lyrics, such as “I got cake and I know he want a slice,” cause the song to feel hastily thrown together and underbaked.
While this single may be sonically generic, its accompanying music video is a rather remarkable spectacle. Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion dance through an Eden-esque garden in amazingly ornate outfits, full of vivid confections. As the video progresses, the scenery turns hellish as Meg and Dua team up to battle nagging suitors in a campy and enjoyable montage.
With its biggest flaw being its generic nature, “Sweetest Pie” still has the potential to be a fun, albeit short-term, addition to any top hits playlist. The beat is peppy, the lyrics are easy to sing along to, and the star power is undeniable. However, when Megan Thee Stallion and Dua Lipa promise the next big hit and fail to deliver, it will be hard for fans not to feel disappointed any time the song plays.

Oliver Tree, a.k.a. “Alien Boy,” transported fans to his planet inside Boston’s House of Blues on March 11. The attendees, lined up outside the sold-out venue’s red fluorescent signs, wrapped all corners of the block. Their outfits, complete with painted jean jackets, cowboy hats, fur coats with flame motifs, brightly bleached hair, and all kinds of stripes and squiggles, were a fitting introduction to the eccentricity of Oliver Tree.
The packed House of Blues audience welcomed the musician with dim lighting and homey decor. Most attendees were leveled on the floor facing the changing colors of the stage, or standing above it on one of the two balconies, before anyone got on stage. Even then, the crowd’s excitement, expressed through chatter and chanting, was unmistakable.
25-year-old alternative artist Sueco was the concert’s first opener. With his drummer to his right and his smiley tattooed guitarist to his left, the artist stood in front of a neon red sign reading “Sueco” dressed in a striped long sleeve. As soon as he sang his drum heavy hit “It Was Fun While it Lasted” with the shadows of waving hands under blue lighting, the edgy tone of the concert was set. He demanded that everyone rock out with him, threw out merch, and crowd surfed. He even smashed his electric guitar: “Imma throw this out to one of you after the show just so nobody gets hurt right now.” But Sueco truly let the audience know they were in for an interactive ride when he called out for a drummer in the crowd.
The concert’s second opener, 18-year-old Ontario native 347aidan, added a youthful sound to the venue's atmosphere. He passionately sang “Cigarettes and Adderall” before sharing that it was his first tour performance. The new artist proudly sang hits like “Memories” and audience favorite, “Dancing in My Room.”
Oliver Tree welcomed an anticipatory crowd wearing his classic pink and purple windbreaker, oversized blue pants, pink cat eye sunglasses, and blonde half bowl cut. After ending his first song with a dab, he yelled “Let’s make this a night we’ll never forget!” As he stood in front of a backdrop of a barn on fire, Tree dedicated his next song, “Alien Boy,” to “all the alien boys and the alien girls.” He circled the stage doing silly dance moves under iridescent lighting while the crowd chanted the lyrics word for word. After performing two songs, Tree said, “Thank you, goodnight,” introducing the audience to the first skit of the night. He complained that there was no time for another song, and said he was told that the crowd did not want to hear more. The artist's shameless personality and sense of humor was a refreshing complement to his alternative and indie pop sounds.
This concert was perfectly in line with the aesthetics of Oliver Tree’s new album “Cowboy Tears,” which incorporates country elements into his already dynamic and catchy sound. With songs like “Cowboys Don’t Cry,” the artist’s latest release maintains the unconventional lyrics, intricate guitar melodies, and distorted sounds that made Tree an indie chart-topper in the past. His affinity for all things out of the ordinary was clear, and proudly embraced by the crowd. Tree did not hold back. He screamed, “I am a human and I am allowed to grow and evolve and change. I’m taking this stupid ass outfit off,” before stripping to reveal a white and blue tracksuit. While a clone wearing his previous outfit walked on stage to pick it up. He roused the weed smokers in the audience, then jokingly told security to find them. The roaring crowd pumped their hands emphatically under bright red lighting, waiting to see what Oliver Tree would do next. His performance of “All That,” including a fierce death drop and head shaking, certainly gifted fans with the escape they came looking for.
The crowd jumped eagerly during his performance of the raucous hit “Fuck.” But the House of Blues shook most when Tree and his friend, artist “Little Ricky ZR3,” performed unreleased music from their upcoming mixtape. The new songs were well received, and so was the fake cow Tree proceeded to ride during his next, much slower jam. For fans, Tree’s performance was a must see.

The Harvard Crimson: “What’s your trajectory in the next five years?”
Shock: “Right to the top, my boy, right to the top.”
Braden Shock Ellis '24 picked up the violin when he was four. Then he moved to the cello. Then the bass. Between the Juilliard Pre-College program, NYO, Curtis Summerfest, and Interlochen, he found a new love: producing.
“My dad produces for fun and used to do it a lot back in college and I was like ‘that’s so cool’ so I started doing it myself; so I taught myself,” he said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I learned, outside of bass, how to play guitar, electric bass, drums, and a little bit of trombone when I need to, and piano most prominently.”
In high school, rather than the typical path, he took college classes and allowed his musical exploration to take over his academic free time.
“I had all this other time where kids are in school from seven to three … to explore my sound and develop,” he said. Collaboration with other artists, he found, became an integral part of the musical journey.
“One of my friends I used to play with in high school, Julian Miltenberger ’22. I was in a band with him. We had a really nice pianist named Micah Graves. The way that they meshed together, I wanted to be them so bad. They had so much groove, so much style, and I would just try to imitate that,” he added.
Arriving at Harvard, a world of artistic freedom and possibility opened up for Shock.
“In high school, I was always really busy with the classical stuff,” he said. “I have mad ADHD, so making beats was like my escape from everything else; I would always be making all this kind of random stuff, but since I got here more people have a demand for one kind of thing over the other.”
By responding to requests for “slimy” and “Young Thug-type” beats, Shock found a new niche. Indeed, his status as a musician on campus is well-known to both friends and peers alike. “Mostly, what people know me as is the producer or the guy who makes music… that’s kind of been becoming part of the brand that I've been developing, which is cool because I always get to share with people what I've been working on recently,” Shock said.
The moniquer “Shock” is also a testament to his transforming brand in college. Originally, he went by Brady Williams but changed the name to Shock Apollo upon a friend’s suggestion. As he said, “I dropped the ‘Apollo’ later. It stuck because the phrase became ‘Ayo Shock, gimme a beat.’”
Musically, partly thanks to his rigorous classical training aided by natural talent, Shock sees — or rather, hears — the world with a unique perspective.
“As someone with synesthesia and perfect pitch, any time I hear a note I immediately get to thinking something I can’t get away from,” he said. “If I'm at a party, I’m immediately starting to break down what the kick pattern of a song is, what key it's in, what I feel like they — the producer — could've done better. It’s instant.”
He integrates this dynamic relationship into his music, allowing him to create not only a complex product, but a fresh one.
“When I play certain notes, I see certain colors, so when I play chords or chord progressions I see this thing happening…. I try to make my beats kind of vivid in that sort of way,” he said. “ I try to make my beats feel kind of surreal, but very familiar at the same time. It's also what I try to do when I play bass: keep it interesting, but also something you've never heard before.”
When it’s time to make a track, Shock follows one of three paths. One option is to go to YouTube, search by least-viewed first, find a sample, and chop it up as necessary. More often than not, however, he starts with piano and crafts the other sounds around as necessary. Or, if low on inspiration, he searches through his libraries and finds a sound he likes.
Impressively, Shock works without professional machines or studios; all he needs is his mind and his computer. “My dad had this Akai MPC3000 that he got in 1994 or something — the week it came out — but I always thought it was a hassle to use,” the producer said. “Logic has this function called musical typing where you can use your keyboard to play beat pads, although it only uses one velocity … but I've gotten really good at that.”
In Logic, Shock is able to craft his sound and come into his own. To his surprise, people often tell him his tracks sound like Ye’s. He said, “‘I'm like ‘ok, that’s interesting’ because I don't listen to a whole lot of Kanye stuff nor do I really follow Kanye that much. I suppose that’s a good sign, I guess. I like to chop a lot of gospel and soul samples, so that might be why people get that idea.”
Rather than listen to other producers for inspiration — even his favorites Brock Berrigan and 40 Ali — Shock describes his sound as “self-inspired.” “Because I would just listen to my own stuff a whole lot, it would give me new ideas based off of my own sound,” he said. “I've been trying to branch out a little bit — learn something new — which is how you keep developing.”
In terms of genre, Shock doesn’t consider himself tied to one specific area. “I produce pop stuff, future funk, oldies-style 90s-style ballads,” he added. “So whatever you need, I know how to do,” he said. However, Shock’s journey does not stop here. In fact, this is just the beginning. While Shock is currently known as a producer, the goal is to be the headliner.
“I’d like to rap and stuff, too,” he said. “It’d be crazy if I could just hop up on stage and then play every instrument that’s up there, on some Prince-type stuff. I’m not trying to repeat what Lil Wayne did with that little guitar solo back in the day; I know what I'm doing on the instruments.”
The vision is there, and it’s a fresh one.
“I just think that's the type of artist you didn't see that much: someone who can rap, but also be able to play a lot of instruments — like a musician who’s also a rapper but a rapper who's also a really good musician. When was the last time you saw that? Hopefully I can combine those too and bring some good music,” he said.
The ride to the top can be lonely at times, but Shock has a team of supporters following him closely.
“The first person I'd probably shout out is my brother, who’s also a freshman here. When I would be making beats or just any kind of music … he’d always let me know when something sounded fucked up: ‘Nah that was boof bro you’ve gotta take that one back to the studio. Work on it again.’ Even if I thought it was fire, I could always trust his judgment, which has been invaluable,” he said.
The future is bright, but Shock’s vision is brighter. He said, “If anyone sees me out in the street say ‘ayo Shock what’s up?’ If you need beats, I got you. Watch out for me in five years.”

While most modern artists choose to collaborate with their peers, Red Velvet has created K-pop’s next spring classic, “Feel My Rhythm,” by collaborating with none other than classical music legend Johann Sebastian Bach. Cleverly released on March 21 (Bach’s birthday), Red Velvet’s “The ReVe Festival 2022 — Feel My Rhythm,” does more than just highlight fun rhythms like the title suggests; it features six eccentric songs that work together to make one of Red Velvet’s most cohesive, sonically pleasing albums to date.
The album title is a reference to the lead single, “Feel My Rhythm,” and a homage to Red Velvet’s music festival concept, the ReVe Festival. The similarities to previous Red Velvet projects end with the title. On their latest effort, the quintet challenged themselves to create “spring” music. In an interview about the new project, Red Velvet’s visionary leader Irene said, “We wanted to show and branch out to a different side of us through dropping an album in spring. We focused on inviting people to Red Velvet’s spring by expressing how we came to spring from the winter season.”
So far, their style experimentation has worked. As of March 20, “The ReVe Festival 2022 — Feel My Rhythm” has recorded a staggering 516,866 stock pre-orders, making it Red Velvet’s most pre-ordered album to date.
If “Red Flavor” and “Power Up” are Red Velvet’s summer bops, “Psycho” is their winter hit, and “Peek-A-Boo” is their autumn anthem, then Red Velvet completes their title as the “Queens of the Seasons” with their latest title track and spring stunner, “Feel My Rhythm.” Sampling the Bach arrangement “Air on the G String,” “Feel My Rhythm” does not hold back on mashing the elegance of classical music with the intensity of K-pop.
At first listen, the song is a bit overwhelming: The instrumentals and vocals pair into a convoluted sound. It starts off deceptively simple with the pairing of Wendy and Seulgi’s silky vocals and violins playing the melody of “Air on the G String,” albeit in the key of C sharp major (the Bach arrangement is originally in the key of D major. The song does an instant 180 as Irene’s entrance and introduction of high hats that drive the song’s rhythm forward. The violin melody of Bach comes back as a motif, especially during the chorus, to inject a spring-like, elegant quality amid all of the K-pop musical chaos. In the chorus, the descending scale when the quintet sings “바로 지금 (Play my rhythm)” is addicting and the stretching of notes in the following lines, “Follow follow my heartbeat / 해가 떠올 때까지” adds to the song’s feeling of longing. With its energetic, feel-good chorus backed by a soulful orchestral melodic line, “Feel My Rhythm” is the perfect child of Red Velvet’s “Power Up” and “Psycho.”
The second and third tracks, “Rainbow Halo” and “Beg For Me,” both find their roots in the “Velvet” side of Red Velvet’s musical style with R&B-inspired groovy melodies. “Rainbow Halo” excels in its pre-chorus that features the members doing a clever vocal interpretation of the lyrics “니가 쿵하고 떨어진 자리 / 누군가 쓱하고 그려놓은 그림,” which roughly translates to “The place where you fell with a thud / The painting that was drawn by someone with a whoosh,” with fun vocal swoops at the words “thud” and “whoosh.” Meanwhile, Joy and Yeri’s smooth, chic vocals pair especially well with the sexier groove of “Beg For Me” featuring an unexpected, but well-executed rap verse from main vocalist (yes, you read that right) Wendy.
The next track, “BAMBOLEO,” is the perfect song for a late night drive with all of the windows down and the spring breeze floating in. The retro instrumentals and Red Velvet’s dreamy vocals, especially Seulgi’s breathy adlibs, succeed in representing the theme of dancing all night and the title, which is Spanish for “sway.” “Good, Bad, Ugly, on the other hand, lets Red Velvet’s vocals shine through its slower, ballad-like tempo. Although this song is arguably the least memorable one on the album due to its repetitive nature, it features beautiful lyrics that revolve around loving oneself, including, “Life is a box of chocolates / Sometimes good, sometimes bad, and ugly / But I love me.”
But, the best B-side track of this well-crafted album is the finale, “In My Dreams.” The song is like a music box winding up in the beginning with soft vocals and building to the refrain that fills with a powerful fanfare before finally winding down to a soft, wistful echo. The members of Red Velvet take turns singing the main line, “In my dreams, you love me back,” but Irene’s version is the most hauntingly beautiful. This song is the perfect ending to an album that featured the best of Red Velvet.
In their press conference, Red Velvet’s main vocalist, Wendy, said, “Going beyond summer queens, we want to achieve the spot of spring queens.” From this author’s perspective, Red Velvet has more than earned that title with this masterpiece of an album.

When the documentary “Tiger King” premiered on Netflix in March 2020, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. With families across the world suddenly plunged into quarantine, binging television together became a bonding experience many turned to in adjusting to the new normal. “Tiger King”’s absurdity made it an instant success in this domain. With a slew of eccentric characters and an outlandish story, there was immediate interest in adapting the story to a scripted series. In the documentary’s height, production began on “Joe vs. Carole.”. Two years later, the show has finally premiered exclusively on NBC’s streaming platform Peacock.
By now, excitement for “Tiger King” has certainly died down. The Nov. 2021 release of the second season theoretically could have drummed up more interest, but instead was met with poor reviews and accusations of beating a dead horse. "Joe vs. Carole” had a large hurdle to overcome, and unfortunately it didn’t quite make the mark.
When recreating a story that has already been told, it’s important to figure out what a new adaptation adds to the conversation. Because “Tiger King” tells the entire tale of big cats and murder in retrospect, “Joe vs. Carole” adds in the way of recreation. It’s much easier to relate to a lived experience when a viewer can see the events firsthand, rather than through an interview response. In “Joe vs. Carole,” the audience can better relate to Carole Baskin on a human level. She may be odd, she may make some shocking fashion choices, but Carole Baskin should never have been perceived as the villain of the “Tiger King” story. Joe Exotic garnered his audience support through his boldness and charisma, rather than his actions. According to the scripted adaptation, viewers were far too quick to believe his side and dismiss all of the troubling allegations against him. “Joe vs. Carole” fleshes out both characters in a more sympathetic and well-rounded manner, pushing the viewer to agree that, in the end, Joe Exotic should never have been rallied behind.
This series also features a standout performance from Kate McKinnon as Carole Baskin. John Cameron Mitchell also does an admirable job in his role as Joe Exotic, but he’s a far less complex character to portray. McKinnon’s performance is more nuanced and genuine, which informs the uncharismatic reception of Baskin as an interviewee in “Tiger King.” Despite Baskin’s humorous personality, McKinnon entirely deviates from her comedic roles in a more grounded portrayal. Her dynamic with Kyle MacLachlan, who plays the role of Baskin’s husband Howard, is perhaps the most compelling element of the show. The remainder of the cast, with a few exceptions, has clear difficulty hitting the mark of realistically depicting these characters and storylines, with many performances coming off as forced and awkward.
What the series lacks compared to the original documentary is the element of surprise. What made “Tiger King” so compelling was the unbelievable twists and turns in the plot. Any scripted adaptation of this material will inherently lack the suspense that created the foundation for the franchise. In “Tiger King,” we knew the outcome from the first episode, but the path to get there was unwaveringly fascinating. In “Joe vs. Carole,” we are following a path that we already know. Those that have delved into the “Tiger King” universe, including those who watched Season Two, would already know all of the information provided. “Joe vs. Carole” merely repackages it.
Another glaring shortcoming of “Joe vs. Carole” is its underwhelming use of visual effects. Of course, using real tigers would defeat the purpose of protecting the wildlife that was shown abused in “Tiger King.” Still, the CGI animals are painfully distracting. Furthermore, the cinematography also remains uninspired and flat. The scripted series would have been the perfect opportunity to diverge from the documentary’s straightforward visual style and try something more experimental, but it is shot in essentially the same way as the original.
While “Joe vs. Carole” may cement Carole Baskin as a maligned woman in the scope of public opinion, it adds exceptionally little in the way of entertainment and information. Even the most loyal fans of the “Tiger King” franchise will have difficulty connecting to the series. When a new fad show reaches popularity, it’s important to evaluate its longevity. “Tiger King” benefited heavily from a miracle of timing — but given “Joe vs. Carole”’s two-year production timeline, it was unrealistic to expect the audience would stick around.

With melodramatic music videos, erotic fanfictions, and witty memes, the Harry Potter fandom has fully embraced shipping culture. Unfortunately, not all these ships have sailed: Here are the top five Harry Potter ships that are not canon.
5. Drapple (Draco & Apple)
Praised by Draco actor Tom Felton for its creativity, this ship is mostly known by fans who are too deeply immersed in the Potter shipping scene. Draco’s fruity love interest first makes an appearance in the movie “The Prisoner of Azkaban,” where his bite out of the juicy green apple looked a tad too sexy to Drapple shippers. In “The Half-Blood Prince,” Draco uses a Vanishing Cabinet as a passage between Hogwarts and a dark magic store. Before the Death Eaters enter Hogwarts this way, the apple becomes Draco’s partner in crime as he tries out the Cabinet with it. When the apple comes back to him, a disturbed Draco finds that someone has taken a bite — one can only hope that he did not say “Avada Kedavra” to the apple’s affair.
4. Harmony (Harry & Hermione)
Could Hermione really have fallen in love with Ron? Harmony shippers think not. Obviously, Harry is much better suited for the beloved heroine ­— mainly because he is not Ron. Unlike Ron, Harry doesn’t leave his friends on their search for horcruxes because he is bored. Luckily, Ron’s exit gave Harmony shippers some cute Harmony scenes — including the duo’s spontaneous dance that definitely appeared more romantic than friendly. They stay on people’s minds: Dumbledore tries playing Cupid for the two, Rita Skeeter wrote an article about “Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache,” and Ron’s jealousy itself conjured a Harmony kissing scene… So just admit your feelings, you two!
3. Snily (Snape & Lily)
“After all this time?” ”Always.” This exchange between Dumbledore and Snape has made it onto tattoos, tote bags, and wall decor. While no other characters have the same patronus, Snape’s undying love for Harry’s Mother Lily is reflected in his doe patronus, which is identical to hers. After Lily’s death, Snape’s guilt inspires his double-agent death eater role through which he tries to protect Harry. Even in his last moments, Snape only wants to think of Lily by looking into Harry’s green eyes that resemble Lily’s. As much as the secret hero of the series deserves a happy ending, if this ship had sailed, the series would have never been born.
2. Grindeldore (Grindelwald & Dumbledore)
After the duo that would have destroyed the series, here comes the couple that would have annihilated the world! In their younger years, Grindelwald and Dumbledore bonded over sweet ideas such as wizard supremacy and world domination. Although J.K. Rowling has confirmed that the two were in a romantic relationship during this time, neither the original books nor the newer spin-offs include this fact. After Dumbledore’s political views took a liberal turn, he defeated Grindelwald in a legendary duel — Or as Grindeldore shippers would say, they let sparks fly!
1. Dramione (Draco & Hermione)
Dramione is the ship that dominates fanfictions. One factor contributing to its popularity is an Emma Watson interview in which she admits to having a crush on Tom Felton during the earlier movies. The popular “bad boy falls for the good girl” trope also lends itself neatly to the troubled Slytherin and the studious heroine. Of course, Draco and Hermione clearly loathe each other, as evidenced by his degrading comments and her well-placed punch in “Prisoner of Azkaban.” Nevertheless, Dramione shippers simply rely on the next trope to solve this minor problem: They are “enemies to lovers!”

After spending an entire year on Billboard’s Hot 100’s top 40, nearly every regular radio listener or TikTok user has heard the wildly popular song “Levitating.” Sung by 26-year-old British pop star Dua Lipa, the song has been on a wild ride since its release in October 2020. From its immediate radio success to viral runs as a TikTok sound to the questionable remix with Dababy, Dua Lipa’s catchy melody has spent the last 18 months at the forefront of listeners' minds.
But, according to band Artikal Sound System, that melody is not Lipa’s to claim.
Founded in 2012, Artikal Sound System is a reggae band hailing from South Florida. Initially performing with Carribean singers, the band has been releasing music independently in the past several years. And, in defense of their 2017 song “Live Your Life,” the band filed a lawsuit against Lipa on March 1 for copyright infringement.
The band argues that the pop star stole the melody of their 2017 song, which — to an untrained, casual listener’s ear, at least — seems believable. Aside from “Levitating” being slightly faster, the melody is essentially identical to that of Atrikal’s “Live Your Life,” even down to being in the same key.
What makes this copyright dispute more complicated for Dua Lipa — and, frankly, for Artikal as well — is that they are not the only groups vying for rights to this content. On March 4, L. Russell Brown and Sandy Lizner filed another copyright infringement lawsuit against “Levitating.”
Brown and Lizner assert that “Levitating” lifts artistic property from their 1979 disco song “Wiggle and Giggle All Night,” performed by Cory Daye. The resemblances between “Levitating” and “Wiggle and Giggle All Night” are not nearly as striking as those to“Live Your Life,” but the melodies are suspiciously similar. And, considering that “Levitating” and “Live Your Life” have nearly identical melodies, Artikal Sound System should tread carefully before they, too, are implicated in a copyright debacle.
Ultimately, it is impossible to create art in a vacuum. Of course, some instances of “inspiration” are more egregiously plagiaristic than others, but the statement stands: Art begets art. And this all boils down to the age old question of who gets to use what, when, and how? This question, as with most things, always seems to become more urgent and significant as more money becomes involved. With a thriving TikTok presence and the honor of being No. 1 on Billboard’s 2021 year-end Global 200 chart, “Levitating” involves big money. But if Dua Lipa is held responsible for failing to credit the writers of “Live Your Life,” then both she and Artikal Sound System need to appropriately acknowledge their mutual predecessor: disco.

Though William Shakespeare’s works were written centuries ago, their messages remain topical, and their malleability allows directors, actors, and production teams to push those messages further or even in alternate directions. Shakespeare’s works are timely, controversial, and radical — artists can and should approach them as a vehicle for activism.
The common modern-day sentiment around Shakespeare mischaracterizes his plays as outdated and boring. The misconception is understandable — due to the unexciting way they are presented in many middle and high schools and the barrier of the old, heightened language — but inaccurate. Shakespeare’s plays can make for thrilling performances, with their timeless and labyrinthine plots, fierce and assertive female characters, bone-chilling and coldhearted villains, and carefully crafted verse and prose. With just a couple of choices by the production team to make the stories more accessible, the audiences, too, can find the plays thrilling.
Not only are Shakespeare’s plays entertaining, but they also offer unparalleled potential to address contemporary issues. In fact, the content suggests that Shakespeare wanted his plays to be used in this way. He packs many of them with sociopolitical commentary: “The Tempest” urges audiences to question colonialism and slavery, “Othello” prompts reflection on racism and misogyny, and “Twelfth Night” begs for consideration of gender and sexuality. It would be remiss to ignore these opportunities, and even his seemingly non-activist plays can be performed through an activist lens.
Shakespeare’s plays hold a huge potential for activism, and they also serve as a blank slate because so much about them is unclear and unknown, rendering it appropriate and even necessary for theatermakers to contemporize them. Half of Shakespeare’s plays were never performed in his lifetime, the earliest known publication of his complete works was not arranged until after his death, and the various early editions of his texts have significant variations, which means it is impossible to know his original intentions. With Shakespeare, the pursuit of authenticity is futile, which gives artists greater flexibility and creativity with the source material. Artists should take advantage of this interpretive potential, because as recent stagings show, by doing so, the plays become the perfect platform for activism.
In 2021, Shakespeare’s Globe in London presented an edgy, fast-paced, contemporary “Romeo and Juliet” directed by Ola Ince. The play commented on adolescent mental health. Statements such as “about 20% of teenagers experience depression before they reach adulthood” and “75% of children with mental health issues are not receiving treatment” hung above the stage during the play; one deliberately chosen statement at a time framed the audience’s comprehension of each scene. The choice was slightly heavy-handed but powerful and effective, particularly in conjunction with red heart Converse high-tops, a Squishmallow plush, and Mercutio’s e-cigarette vaping habit, which ensured the audience never forgot the characters were representing present-day teenagers.
“Romeo and Juliet” is usually an exhausted play, but Ince re-energized it and reworked it to make audiences reflect on modern-day societal issues she finds important. She examined Shakespeare’s text and highlighted moments and concepts that resonated with her. When Juliet killed herself — in this adaptation, shooting herself in the mouth with a handgun — it was devastating and painful to watch, but it did not feel silly and meaningless, as it does in many productions. It felt like she and the other teenage characters were vulnerable to mental health struggles and not provided with sufficient support from adults, a message that rang relevant to 2021 theatergoers.
In 2019, The Public Theater brought Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing” to New York City with an all-Black cast, directed by Kenny Leon. The play was jubilant, it was full of both laughable and soft, heartfelt moments, and crucially, it was unapologetically Black. It embraced Black culture through music, hair, costumes, and other key choices, like a distinct “okurrr” uttered by Brooks. Aside from the “Stacey Abrams 2020” banner positioned onstage, this production of “Much Ado About Nothing” was not overwhelmingly political — but it was a celebration of Black joy and Black excellence, which is in many ways a radical act.
Casting only Black actors in a play featuring happy, affluent, confident characters allowed Leon to uplift and center Blackness — a powerful and much-needed endeavor in today’s America — through a play written in 1599. Shakespeare probably did not have this goal while creating “Much Ado About Nothing,” which contributes to the brilliance of Leon’s work. Leon reclaimed the play, and another director may reclaim the same play in a different way. Not only did Leon add the unexpected racial dimension, but he also identified ideas that already existed within the text (the value of protest, appreciation of nonconformity, and challenging the patriarchy) and emphasized them in harmony with the racial messaging. “Much Ado About Nothing” is not inherently an activist play, but Leon realized it as such.
Some Shakespeare plays are socially problematic, but they can still be shaped into activist theater. For example, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s 2020 London production of “The Taming of the Shrew,” directed by Justin Audibert, reimagined the misogynistic play by gender-swapping the roles and setting it in a matriarchal society. Perhaps there is space to develop a progressive production of Shakespeare’s misogynistic “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” or his antisemitic “The Merchant of Venice.” It would require intense creative reworking, but it may be possible.
Activist productions such as Ince’s “Romeo and Juliet,” Leon’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” and Audibert’s “The Taming of the Shrew” are the most successful approaches to Shakespeare performances. They resonate with modern-day audiences and fully exploit the opportunities extended by the text. Art is political; artists should claim this fact and use it to their and others’ benefit. Shakespeare’s works are too valuable for theatermakers and theatergoers to allow them to fall out of relevance. There is no need to paraphrase the language; Shakespeare’s 16th-century words can and should be used to speak to 21st-century issues.

As the final days of Cambridgian winters draw to an end (save a few snowstorms interspersed between 60-degree days), Harvard students begin to emerge from their thinly insulated colonial dorms and shed their goose-feather overcoats in exchange for sunglasses and T-shirts. Nothing could be more timely than the opening of Harvard Square’s newest establishment and blackhole for college student dollars: Life Alive.
Life Alive is a Boston-area chain of cafes that serve organic, plant-based dishes. With a cluster of brightly colored balloons welcoming visitors into a bohemian space decorated with aptly chosen hanging flowers and beach signs, Harvard Square’s Life Alive exudes a sense of calmness. The first floor is bright and floral, lined with colorful furniture and exposed brick, and when coupled with “Mystery of Love” by Sufjan Stevens playing on the loudspeaker, the restaurant’s ambience feels neither artificial nor deliberate.
Life Alive’s menu takes special care to highlight the various health benefits of their products. For example, lattes: a Matcha for “Stress Relief,” or a “Heart Opening” Mexican Chocolate. And their “Greens” menu section is hardly Annenberg lettuce: some bowls come with kalamata olives and bok choy, others “forbidden” (black) rice.
When asked to recommend the quirkiest items on their menu, Life Alive cashiers gamely proposed “Blue Magic” — a smoothie made of blue-green algae, coconut in three different forms, and chia, among other ingredients found only at Whole Foods. Alongside the Blue Magic smoothie, they also recommended Watermelon Poke, which although not in season still sounded intriguing enough to try.
“Blue Magic” tasted, unsurprisingly, much like coconut. The smoothie comes in a glass jar, with no straw because Life Alive doesn’t have straws. Although this omission was not a problem for this drink, as it had a more or less homogeneous consistency, thicker smoothies like the Mango Slush require a spoon for consumption. The smoothie itself had an overall mild taste, although it was rather gritty at the bottom due to the chia seeds. The smoothie’s greatest appeal is its color: something that falls between baby blue and cornflower. There is some self-satisfaction in knowing you’re getting your daily antioxidants through flashy health foods bolstered by everyone’s favorite cyanobacteria. All in all, this melted coconut gelato drink should have been icier for a more refreshing experience. Just as adding banana to a smoothie automatically makes it a banana smoothie, Blue Magic’s amalgamation of unique ingredients were lost in the overpowering flavor of coconut.
The watermelon poke was surprisingly good at impersonating fish: dispersed chunks of watermelon soaked with just enough chili lime and ginger miso vinaigrette flavor meant the only indication of watermelon was the subtly crunchy texture. Other pieces still retained a hint of sweetness, which combined with the mango pieces proved to be the perfect balance between savory and sweet. Despite the watermelon poke being labeled a seasonal dish, coupled with the juxtaposition of Life Alive’s beachy interior design against the month-old snow mound somehow still existing outside, the vegetables and flavors proved impressively fresh and alive. Certainly worth a re-order!
Life Alive feels like the perfect place to wistfully stare out at a bustling JFK Street, pretending to aimlessly stir (remember, no straws) my Golden Milk latte, after a long day sustained on multivitamins and seminar classes. It would be the place to go to aggressively type out emails while indulging in a palate of all conceivable forms of vegetables, fruits, and macro and micro nutrients. It is, to put it succinctly, incredibly vibeacious.

In “This Is How Your Marriage Ends,” Matthew Fray argues that marriages end not with a bang but with a whimper. In his debut self-help book, the relationship counselor offers readers insight into how to save their relationships using examples from his own marriage and those of his clients. Unfortunately, the advice he offers fails to consider the female perspective and in fact often infantilizes and vilifies women.
To start, take the so-called “Fish Sandwich Incident” that Fray highlights in the introduction to the book. In the anecdote, one of Fray’s clients, Grayson, calls him in an irate panic. He has eaten a fish sandwich and is calling preemptively to solicit advice on how to deal with his wife, who is sure to freak out about his eating a fish sandwich despite their collective resolution to be vegan. Grayson is defensive and attempts to dismiss his wife’s hypothetical anger, blaming his decision on a lack of restaurant options during the pandemic and his overwhelming hunger. But Fray tells Grayson that none of that matters — the wife would be hurt that Grayson betrayed her and a promise they made. It’s not about the fish sandwich, it’s about the way she feels.
The problem with this approach, as with many of Fray’s pieces of advice to his presumably male audience, is that teaching men to navigate around the feelings of women doesn’t take into account that women are rational beings capable of understanding logic as well as emotion. In this example, Grayson’s wife is so hypothetically blinded by the stinging betrayal of Grayson’s fish sandwich consumption that she cannot grasp any of his reasoning. By advising Grayson to cater to his wife’s feelings, Fray perpetuates the image of Grayson’s wife as irrational and driven by emotion rather than reason.
Another example of Fray magically projecting the feelings of women is when he explains the true problem with leaving dishes in the sink instead of in the dishwasher. For three-quarters of a page, Fray urges his readers to imagine themselves as a woman who spends all day thinking about her husband: what to make him for dinner, what gifts to get his parents for the holidays, how he would feel about every decision she makes. At the end of the day, how frustrating is it that she also has to deal with his dishes? While his intentions are good, Fray sounds blatantly misogynistic in assuming that there is very little going on in any given wife’s life outside of her husband and her kids.
Fray initially gained traction on the internet from this very anecdote about his dishes in a blog post titled “She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By The Sink”. Many portions of the book are lifted from his blog posts — for example, his “Monster-Under-the-Bed-Theory” comes from a blog post he wrote for “The Good Men Project,” a site with the copyrighted slogan “the conversation no one else is having” to which Fray often contributes. The theory goes like this: When a kid says there’s a monster under his bed, you don’t dismiss his feelings and tell him there’s no monsters. Instead, you tell him that you hear him, that it sucks to have that feeling, and that you’ll check and make sure there’s no monsters. He applies this to relationships, and argues that everyone should use the same tenderness with their partner. Like in the fish sandwich example, Fray has decent intentions but infantilizes women and reduces them to illogical emotions.
Fray’s framework is to explain how the way he hurt others helped him become a better person and attempt to guide others towards self-improvement. Fray relies on self-deprecating humor to describe the ways in which his actions hurt his wife, emphasizing his poor character to establish credibility for the advice he gives. This has two negative effects: First, it makes readers feel uncomfortable and guilty to support, with their time and money, someone making a career and profits off of treating his wife poorly. Second, it erodes readers’ trust in the author.
In one section, Fray describes the adverse effects of toxic masculinity, citing the statistic that men are more likely to commit suicide and have more trouble reaching out for mental healthcare. While this is an incredibly important issue to discuss, 50 pages earlier, Fray recalls how he and his friends bullied a gay kid at their high school into attempting suicide. His hypocrisy makes readers less sympathetic to his struggles, which he blames vaguely on the way society treats men.
Fray’s book is bound to leave readers with more feminist rage and less faith in men than when they started reading. While the author has good intentions, “This Is How Your Marriage Ends” reads more like a guide to making readers feel better about the people they hurt, rather than a roadmap to a successful 21st-century marriage.

Coming off the success of the critically acclaimed “Freshwater” and “The Death of Vivek Oji,” Nigerian author Akwaeke Emezi tackles the romance genre with their new novel, “You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty.” Ripe with paradisiacal imagery, “You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty,” is an elegant take on the modern love story, despite its slow start.
It’s been five years since Feyi Adekola lost her husband in a harrowing car accident, and she’s ready to start dating again. After an encounter at a rooftop party, Feyi finds herself drawn to the younger, impossibly handsome Nasir Blake. It’s the kind of romance that’s perfect on paper: He’s patient, and charming, and they look good together. But when Nasir invites her on a whirlwind trip to the Caribbean, Feyi finds herself falling for the one person that’s unequivocally hands off.
“You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty” is a novel that takes its time. The story lingers in New York for a moment too long as Emezi struggles with setting the course of Feyi’s journey. Nasir isn’t introduced as a character until a couple of chapters in, and their will-they, won’t-they romance feels superfluous. The core of the story is the inconvenience of the central romance; the romantic and narrative tension that arises between Feyi and her eventual love interest is what draws readers in. Scenes in the first quarter of the novel feel like they are simply stalling until the “real” plot begins. Since the bulk of Feyi’s character development and healing occurs later, it’s easy to want to skip over the first couple of chapters of the novel.
But, Emezi makes up for the slow start as soon as Feyi’s plane touches down in the Caribbean. Their affection for the island is obvious: Pages are soaked with sensory imagery, grounding the reader in the naturalist landscape of the island. Emezi’s magical realist roots come through in their descriptions of the island, writing of “soaring birds of paradise,” “kaleidoscopes of butterflies,” and “monkeys peering between the leaves.” Emezi flexes their descriptive skills as the protagonist luxuriates in a Caribbean estate, eating food prepared by celebrity chefs and attending art-world parties. It's almost like a dream, a phrase Feyi repeats multiple times over the course of the story. And parts of this book do feel like a fairy tale: the insta-love between Feyi and her eventual love interest, the grandiose lifestyle that Feyi finds herself in.
One must forgive Emezi for Feyi’s idealistic love story. Stories like these, where characters profess their love for each other within two weeks of meeting, where protagonists find themselves whisked away to a tropical paradise where they meet the man of their dreams, constantly populate the romance genre. “You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty” brings a fresh perspective. Characters in the novel are unabashed in their sexuality, and natural hair is spoken about with ease. In a genre permeated by white protagonists and white love stories, it is refreshing to see a queer Black woman take center stage. Feyi is given the room to make mistakes, she is allowed to feel beautiful, and most of all, she is allowed to be happy — something that doesn’t often happen to protagonists with similar identities in the romance genre. The strength of Emezi’s protagonist drives this novel; despite the trauma she has endured, she consistently chooses her own happiness.
Even with the novel’s slow start, Emezi’s three-dimensional characters and beautifully descriptive writing pull the novel together. One is propelled through Feyi’s dreamscape and comes out with a greater understanding of love, loss, and life. Above all, “You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty” is a stunning portrait of one woman’s search for beauty and life after trauma, and is an enjoyable read for anyone looking to pick up a book this spring.

The curtain at the Citizens Bank Opera House rose on March 3rd for the first show of Boston Ballet’s program ChoreograpHER, which runs until March 13. The opening night featured five world premieres choreographed by female artists from a variety of creative fields, ranging from visual arts to modern dance.
The choreographers included New York City Ballet principal dancer Tiler Peck, award-winning modern dancer Melissa Toogood, Boston Ballet’s own principal dancer Lia Cirio, internationally acclaimed visual artist Shantell Martin, and renowned choreographer and Harvard alumnus Claudia Schreier ’08.
The program featured a diverse set of ballet and dance styles, each representing different meanings.
“It was really amazing to see so many of my colleagues stepping into different styles of dance,” company dancer Schuyler C. Wijsen said in an interview about the program.
Melissa Toogood’s dance featured contemporary styles and techniques, a contrast to some of the other more classical pieces in the program.
Wijsen continued, “Watching Melissa’s ballet in the studio for the first time I was blown away, and I thought these are my colleagues; I take class with them every day and here they are doing these incredible things.”
For many of the performers and choreographers, the show was a long time coming. Another company dancer, Louise C. Hautefeuille, recounts the process of starting Lia Cirio’s piece, “Chaptered in Fragments,” two years ago during the pandemic:
“The 60 [or so] person company was divided into 5 or 6 different pods,” she recalled. “We were masked, and we relied on big screens in front of the room to connect each of the studios so we would have entire rehearsals over zoom. There were these big massive cameras in front of the room. And that’s how we started Lia’s piece.”
In fact, Hautefeuille learned the entire choreography of “Chaptered in Fragments” over Zoom. The piece is split into several parts, each highlighting different small groups of dancers, making it easier to safely create over the pandemic. One part seamlessly transforms into the next with help from creative lighting and music changes.
“I think that’s part of what inspired her piece ‘Chaptered in Fragments’ — the fact it was choreographed in fragments and different moments in time,” said Hautefeuille.
Dancers Hautefeuille and Wijsen both expressed their admiration for the choreographers, especially pulling off their work in such a challenging time.
“[Claudia] was so organized with her vision … It was really cool to see the whole thing being put together and how she would work with the dancers to make the movement she wanted but also fit each dancer’s personal artistry. I think that was my favorite part … seeing how she would adjust and how the dancers would adjust to make it a cohesive piece,” said Wijsen.
Hautefeuille described working with Cirio, who, as a principal dancer at the Boston Ballet, is also a colleague of Hautefeuille’s:
“Lia I have watched and admired for years and years now, and getting to know her better through this process has been amazing … She has this very distinct vision and mind that is really impressive to me … She knew exactly what she wanted and she knew the things to say to help us get to that place because she’s been in our position before.”
Hautefeuille adds, “[Lia] managed to find the right balance between choreographer and colleague, which I think is really hard.”
The Boston Ballet started the ChoreograpHER initiative in 2018 to celebrate female creators, who have been historically underrepresented in that side of the dance field.
In 2018 and 2019, ChoreograpHER performances were presented in BB@home, a series that took place in the Boston Ballet rehearsal studio with limited tickets for the general public. The initiative was set to debut at the Opera House in 2020, but it was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the current program featuring at the Opera House is the first time the initiative has taken the stage there.
Many have expressed appreciation and gratitude for the initiative.
“Ballet is such a women dominated artform that you would want and hope that women have an equal voice in more artistic leadership positions. Seeing that I’m in a company that really prioritizes giving a platform to those voices is amazing,” said Wijsen.
Not only has it pushed barriers on the artform, the initiative has helped open up a new realm of possibilities for many female artists.
“When Mikko first approached me [to choreograph a piece] I thought no, this isn’t what I do. But then he gave me total permission to fail and I thought, ‘I should try,’” said choreographer Melissa G. Toogood.
Hautefeuille said, “When I was watching the ChoreograpHER choreographers, I felt like it spoke to me a bit more because it was women only. I remember it being like `Oh. Maybe someday I could do this,’ and that was something special.”

What happens when a person leaves a place but never arrives at their destination? What happens when an immigrant leaves their entire country and family behind only to immigrate to a culture with no aligning values, and seemingly no sense of connection or acceptance?
In “Customs,” Solmaz Sharif examines the American immigrant experience: “to exist in the nowhere of the arrival terminal” — to completely leave one’s people and home behind, but never arrive at an accepting culture. Born to Iranian parents, Solmaz Sharif uses poetry to address the stark difference between her identity and American culture, and what it means to live in the no-man’s land between two different cultures.
A large portion of the collection highlights Sharif’s culture shock when experiencing American materialism and her disillusionment with its glorification of war, obsession with innovation, and tendency to exclude. In a poem entitled “Planetarium,” Sharif describes her trip to Joshua Tree, awes at the explosive testing at a distant air force base reminiscent of shooting stars, and meditates on the glorification and beauty that America can find in war.
“Now What,” one of the first poems of “Customs,” explains the American discontentment and constant need for innovation and materialistic gratification: “On Instagram: a man / has bought a ten-foot-by-four- / foot photo of a bridge / he lives / beside, bridge he can see just outside / his window, window which serves / as a ten-foot-by-four- / foot frame”
America isn’t the land of the free, writes Sharif — even for those who can make it across the wall. The central theme of the work focuses on displacement and a lack of acceptance from a culture so often advertised as a melting pot. Sharif refers to America as a “kingdom,” one in which immigrants live on the edge. Further than physical exclusion, however, Sharif suggests that there may be an even more painful, less physical exclusion — a cultural shunning from within. In “Without Witch,” Sharif writes, “I am without the kingdom / And thus of it. / I am– / even when inside the kingdom– / without”.
While the speaker finds herself physically living in America, she laments the common, immigrant truth of never experiencing cultural acceptance. And, if her writing centers around her immigration experience, the very structure of the poetry confirms the incessant identity battle of immigrants. The very last stanza of the poem cuts mid-sentence as if the story portrayed through this poem is ongoing, never finished — just as her life in between cultures will still remain.
The style of the poetry itself reads as if looking into the inner thoughts of the speaker; the ideas themselves are profound and enlighten the immigrant struggle, though the fragmented stanzas and structure often disrupt the reading flow and the overarching message. The combination of prose and fragmented poetry may make this piece of poetry inaccessible to the average reader.
Though it may be tough to understand at first glance, “Customs” gives the reader the opportunity to empathize with a speaker deeply troubled by the immigrant experience. By sharing her experience, Sharif looks to reshape the way readers think about America's relationship with other cultures and calls for change in the way that America accepts difference. It’s only right that a piece entitled “Customs” has so much to declare.

With her debut novel “The Idiot” having been crowned a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, Elif Batuman set towering expectations for the sequel “Either/Or.” Beginning where the first novel left off, Harvard College sophomore Selin Karadağ realizes she has reached the age where the contemplation of love is absolutely vital. In her youth and her “overprivileged” position at Harvard as a Turkish immigrant’s daughter, this newfound obsession means a tangle of personal grief, classic literature, Freudian psychology, and the self-centered agonies of a college student. However, overbearingly well-read and obnoxiously far from self-aware, Batuman’s protagonist is hard to love and even more difficult to trust.
Both “The Idiot'' and “Either/Or'' evoke Batuman’s own life, fictionalizing and re-casting the autobiographical. Selin and Batuman are both daughters of Turkish-Americans raised in New Jersey and attending Harvard College to pursue literature, and Ivan, Selin’s persistent object of desire, is a narrative iteration of Batuman’s own 18-year-old crush.
Batuman’s “Either/Or” is a labor of love and practice in reflection, split into Fall Semester, Spring Semester, and Summer. Time seems to pass without consequence inside Selin’s matter-of-fact narration. Days are slow but weeks fly by. Obsessive fixations on Ivan, on partying, and on her roommate’s beauty fade in and out, eclectic and paradoxically insignificant. There are points where life is beautiful, where the anxieties of being loved and desired become all too relatable, and where Kierkegaard’s “aesthetic life” seems to hold all the answers. Yet “Either/Or,” while mirroring its predecessor’s structure, fails to capture the charmingly infuriating naïveté of Selin and instead drags readers through an overly familiar tale shoved through the lens of a Harvard student. Any relatability that a growing, insecure Selin might have, even the tragedy of losing a best friend to an all-consuming relationship, is thwarted by her persistent inability to perceive accurately and empathetically. Instead, she works overtime to map her own life onto Russian literature.
It is hard to not look upon parts of this book with affection, especially when writing from the very same Quincy dining hall Selin frequents. But despite Batuman’s references to Mather’s objective ugliness and the BDSM-themed parties of a certain literary magazine, she perhaps plays too far into the expectation of a Harvard student’s psyche and the collection of individuality complexes gathered here. Anxieties of a university student are bogged down with literary allusions and self-aggrandizing proclamations of growth, evoking the trope of a Harvard student in hasty, reductive explanations of André Breton and the categorical imperative.
These gaps are perhaps a symptom of the book’s distance from the experience that inspired it. Batuman began “The Idiot” a few years after graduating Harvard but did not write “Either/Or” until turning 40. Sentimental observations of “how brief and magical it was that we all lived so close to each other and went in and out of each other’s rooms, and our most important job was to solve mysteries” speak more to the meditations of a seasoned adult than a depressed and naïve college sophomore. Youth is no longer a source of great curiosity and odd charm, but a sin Selin is not aware she is committing.
A nerdy child of immigrants in a New Jersey high school, college Selin finds herself intoxicated by newfound male attention, sexually liberated in some instances and painfully unaware in others. Her intellectual, emotional, physical, and sometimes psychological obsession with sex is just another bend in her all-important journey to adulthood, with subsequent sexual encounters fading into Selin’s distinct narrativizing of her summer traveling project.
The greatest pause Selin (and this book) fails to take is a moment of critical thought for the many instances of sexual assault and harassment she encounters and perceives. Perhaps Selin is all too unaware to register her friend Lakshmi’s assault or her own brushes with violence, or perhaps her dismissive descriptions result from her lack of vocabulary. Regardless, Selin’s inability to articulate their implications does not play into her favor nor her likeability. In her own biographical description, Batuman does acknowledge Selin’s journey takes her “to some pretty dark places, which she takes to be unavoidable and part of the rich tapestry of life” and asks readers, “but are they?” Yet for all the conversation of French feminist theory in Selin’s life, a conversation about consent and intent is strikingly absent — even for a ’90s college campus.
Batuman is certainly the writer Selin aspires to be: exceptionally talented, obviously well-read, risk-taking, and recognizably unique. And in many ways, that distance of age prevents an older, wiser, contemplative Batuman from accessing Selin’s voice with authenticity. However, self-reflective insights and witty allusions still populate the text, and readers will find a fruitful exercise in young love, identity, and philosophy.
“Either/Or” is available on May 24th, 2022.

Brendan Slocumb’s debut novel “The Violin Conspiracy” begins near the story’s end: Rayquan “Ray” McMillan, a classical violin soloist, has just had his Stradivarius violin — an instrument valued at over 10 million dollars — stolen less than a month away from the most important competition of his life. Throughout the rest of the novel, Ray reflects on his career and the events leading up to the robbery, allowing readers to uncover the mystery of his past while he sorts out the issue at present.
The plot covers a great deal of temporal ground — readers follow Ray from his first violin gig in high school through college and into his professional career. Luckily, the beginning of the story sets up the necessary context for his career and relationships, making these transitions seamless and easy to follow. From the start, readers know which of Ray’s relationships are strained, and which are positive ones with people he looks up to and admires.
The narrative’s clear structure comes from Ray’s reasoning as he attempts to solve the violin mystery. He jumps from one incident to the next without confusion and navigates different settings to yield a captivating yet manageable pace. The inverted time structure also does much to keep the reader curious and engaged; the start of the story introduces many questions that the rest of the novel sets out to answer.
However, the novel’s timeline occasionally produces an emotional disconnect between the reader and the characters. For instance, when Ray’s violin is stolen at the beginning of the novel, he is incredibly distraught and reluctant to play another violin in the meantime. With a big competition in the near future, which is emphasized as extremely important to Ray’s success, his emotional reactions are hard to justify without understanding the family history of his violin, which is not revealed until much later in the story.
Additionally, at times the characters’ reactions do not seem appropriate for the situation at hand and instead only serve the purpose of creating suspense or adding drama. This is often the case for Ray’s family, especially before anyone knows about the value of Ray’s violin. For instance, when Ray’s Grandma Nora gifts Ray the old family violin, most of the family vehemently protests despite believing it to be worthless and not caring about the violin’s existence before she made the decision to give it away. Similarly, Dr. Janice Stevens, Ray’s mentor, has a dramatic reaction over the phone with Ray when she first suspects the true value of Ray’s violin. This moment creates high suspense which is further built by the following flashback, but when she meets with Ray in person, her tone is entirely different and the growing suspense falls flat.
Beyond the mystery of the violin theft, “The Violin Conspiracy” highlights two main struggles in Ray’s life: the difficulty of being a Black soloist in a white-dominated field, and the strain his money and success has placed on his relationships, particularly with his family. Slocumb’s skillful exploration of these complex issues through the lens of Ray’s career effectively creates a nuanced and cohesive plot.
The novel highlights each of these issues by weaving them throughout Ray’s life. The story jumps through settings, from his childhood home in Charlotte to concert halls across America. In each, Slocumb goes in depth into select moments which showcase the different facets of prejudice faced by Ray on his journey to become a professional musician.
Ray faces discrimination from not only his superiors but also his colleages, law enforcement, and total strangers. The reader sees this discrimination come up repeatedly in different forms, from people making assumptions about the kinds of music he plays to people doubting his merits and abilities. These moments come both when Ray is excelling and when he is just living life as a normal person. Slocumb's inclusion of small everyday moments that are punctuated by racism towards Ray brilliantly captures Ray’s reality and allows the reader to understand the depth of Ray’s challenges by experiencing it through his first-person perspective.
However, not all of Slocumb’s descriptions are so skillful; some feel a bit bland. His music metaphors sometimes feel cheesy and forced, and he occasionally breaks into overly flowery language, which is out of place in the rest of the work. Some sections are too descriptive and over explained: After showing, there are times the text proceeds to unnecessarily tell, to explicate in a repetitive way. For instance, the story gives many examples of Ray’s Aunt Rochelle looking out for Ray and helping him when no other family member would. Aunt Rochelle is clearly contrasted with other family members who are only nice to Ray when they need something from him. After illustrating this contrast with repeated examples throughout, near the end, the text unnecessarily spells out this contrast for the reader.
Nevertheless, Slocumb does a great job at giving a deep look into the world of classical music and telling a story of challenges that resonate with a large audience. Coming from a background of classical music and music education, Slocumb is clearly knowledgeable about the specific worlds present in the story, and he does a great job of painting it for everyone else.
Overall, the novel tells a very compelling and valuable story of a Black musician from his childhood to his professional career. It confronts privilege, racial discrimination, complex family relationships, the strain of success, and the stuggle of upholding a family legacy, all in a unique way. With a well-thought-out plot infused with both mystery and complex relationships, “The Violin Conspiracy'' is a thrilling tale not to be missed.

Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for “After Yang."
“After Yang” has all the trappings of a modern sci-fi film: stunning cinematography, an experimental premise, and a beautifully austere score (in this case composed by the legendary composer Ryuichi Sakamoto). Its setting is futuristic, but the technology that the characters interact with is not particularly exciting; we’ve seen similar holographic glasses and humanoid robots in last year’s “Swan Song” and A24’s own “Ex Machina.” What is undeniably new about “After Yang,” though, is its ultimate undertaking: By building a world in which families may buy synthetic, “Chinese” humanoid robots meant to connect their adopted Chinese children to their heritage, the film approaches the question of whether culture can be programmed.
At times, this theme is tackled with painful blatancy. At one point, a prominent character asks in reference to Yang, one such robot or “techno,” “What makes someone Asian?” The remainder of “After Yang” lords the question over the audience, as if leading up to an answer. Despite some poignant metaphors and standalone tearjerker moments, though, the question is left sorely underexplored, and the film’s impact is dampened by this ultimate failure to rise to its occasion.
“After Yang” centers on a family living in a futuristic setting, possibly the United States — minimal other clues are provided. The mother, Kyra, is Black; the father, Jake, is white; and their daughter, Mika, is Chinese. And then there’s Yang — the family’s “techno,” who is somewhat considered Mika’s brother, though the fact of the parents’ ownership of him and their overdependence on him to guide Mika through everyday life casts him as more of a servile figure. When Yang malfunctions and begins to decompose during a nationwide family dance battle, Jake turns to several specialists for help, some sketchier than others. One sketchy specialist has flyers reading both “No yellow in the red, white, and blue,” and “YELLOW PERIL” on a corkboard in his breakroom. (Whether this literature is intended to situate the film’s futuristic setting within the modern-day movement against AAPI hate is not immediately evident, but it is immediately confusing.) The specialist, named Russ, grants Jake access to a gadget loaded with short clips of Yang’s memories. Jake’s findings cause him to rethink his relationships: with Yang, with his daughter, and with the uber-advanced technology so intertwined with his conception of humanity.
The incredibly specific premise of “After Yang” is refreshing, regardless of the confusion it may cause its audience. (In this future America, do considerably more couples adopt Chinese children? If not, what is the market for “technos” like Yang?) However, the film’s themes of displacement and ethnic belonging — sorely under- or misrepresented themes in film today — are not adequately addressed. In short, the film bites off more than it can chew. The tragedy of Yang’s undying subservience to the family, even amid their neglect to affirm him as an individual, is left to the viewer to bemoan. But it would be easier for the viewer to mourn this loss of individuality if Yang were given more screen time. Despite some flashbacks, Yang’s character growth is stunted by the fact of his deadness; he is a robot corpse for three-quarters of the film.
Kogonada, the director of “After Yang,” also directed the 2017 film “Columbus,” at once a story of intellectual love and an ode to the architecture of the American Midwest. Kogonada’s directorial tendency to decenter plot in favor of more spontaneous, nonlinear filmmaking does not succeed in “After Yang” the way it did in “Columbus.” “After Yang” would have benefitted from additional backstory as well as a more concrete form of world-building — which “Columbus,” backlit by predictable American suburbia (while itself not a predictable film), didn’t quite need.
Yang’s character shines in its fullest form in various flashbacks, after Mika’s dependence on him over her overworked parents is established. Yang applies a repository of fun facts to questions in Mika’s life, and even uses the metaphor of grafted fruit trees to assuage Mika’s complicated thoughts on familial belonging. Jake ultimately sees these moments through Yang’s eyes — the chip in Yang’s body seems to have stored his prominent memories as rewatchable clips. More tree imagery appears when a love interest of Yang’s reads him an excerpt of Maya Angelou’s poem, “When Great Trees Fall.” Had the reference been more prominent, rather than relegated to a hazy montage, it would have struck harder. Instead, any pathos stemming from the inclusion of the poem is Angelou’s own doing.
Earlier in another flashback (which, in an innovative and effective strategy, staggers slightly varying visuals and dialogue to mirror the subjectivity of each person’s memory), Yang and Jake chat over tea and question a line from a documentary in which a German man claims that an authentic tea can transport its drinker to a different place and time. The two down their cups and ultimately disagree with the German man. The message is clear: The notion that technology can replace cultural experience is a myth. This tea metaphor is fitting; the premise of “After Yang” hints toward immense possibility, but its execution ultimately leaves little taste in the mouth.

After a long time, “The Music Man” has finally returned to Broadway with none other than Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster ready to take on two of the most iconic roles musical theater has to offer. Expectations and ticket prices were high and while the revival of “The Music Man” might not be an artistic masterpiece, it sure is entertaining.
When Professor Harold Hill (Hugh Jackman), a notorious con artist posing as a charming, smooth-talking salesman, sets foot into River City, the naive and stubborn citizens can only imagine the trouble that is coming their way. Selling instruments to people that have neither knack nor appreciation for music might seem impossible, but not for Professor Harold Hill. He promises to create a marching band that will bring life, love, and laughter to everyone in River City, claiming to be able to exchange trouble for talent.
Now one could surely question the sanity of the people of River City who buy into the ludicrous idea that you can learn to play an instrument in a week. But that person has probably never seen “The Music Man.” After all, Professor Hill is not just known for his elaborate cons but also for his charm and good looks, something that can apparently take you far in River City. Hill manages to cast a rhythmic spell onto the people of River City, including Marian Paroo (Sutton Foster), the town's kind-hearted yet principled librarian and piano teacher. Casting such a spell is not instantaneous, however, but takes two hours' of dancing, singing, and flirting. The musical theater marathon never turns tedious with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster in the starring roles, but even they cannot avoid stumbling here and there along the way.
Hugh Jackman succeeds in bringing the handsome salesman to life. However, his version at times struggles to appear well-rounded and dynamic, often coming off more flat than anything else. He exudes charm and friendliness while posing for pictures and signing autographs in front of the theater, but on stage that charm is less palpable. Not to say that Hugh Jackman does a bad job: He acts, dances, and sings with energy, commitment, and determination, perfectly blending with the ensemble. Rather, separating Jackman from Professor Hill was at times a challenge. That may well be the price to pay for his level of stardom.
Co-star Sutton Foster, on the other hand, does not struggle with similar problems. The Tony-Award winning triple threat has just recently ventured into other areas with the grand finale of her television show “Younger.” Yet she will always remain a Broadway actress at the core. Her return to Broadway was highly anticipated by fans all across the country. “The Music Man,” unfortunately, might not be the ideal show for the grande homecoming.
Casting Sutton Foster as Marian Paroo, an iconic soprano role, is a very unconventional choice. Even though she never showcases her typical Sutton belt, her voice still sounds too “belty” for Marian Paroo, forcing her to sing her way through a lowered version of the songs with less of a crystal clear quality than others had before her. The songs end up sounding different but nevertheless great. What Foster lacks as a soprano she makes up with great wit, impeccable comedic timing, and fabulous dancing. She ultimately succeeds in making the role her own, resulting in a version of Marian Paroo that might be less “legit” but all the more heartwarming, funny and original.
Besides that, the revival is not a new take on the 1957 production. Instead, it aims to convey a feeling of nostalgia and the old “Americana” of lush green hills and white picket fences. The musical is old and some lyrics aged better than others. The director could have put an ironic spin on the lyrics, forcing the audience to confront the bigoted attitudes of that time, or rewrite controversial lyrics to avoid any source of confrontation. This revival chose the latter, lulling its audience members into a blissfully naive sleep. The director clearly chose comfort over provocation.
What the revival lacks in originality, it makes up for with a breathtaking ensemble, featuring beautiful professional dancers and singers. Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster have sizzling chemistry and are a joy to watch, but the ensemble steals the show. Featuring 21 Broadway debuts, the show is a triumphal entry for a new and spectacular generation of performers. The Revival of “The Music Man” might not be original or perfect — and maybe even unnecessary — but it presents a moment of joy in a world that is, now more than ever, darkened by violence. By the time the curtain falls, the audience members are filled with positive energy, joy, and excitement. They might not leave the theater smarter, but at least they leave it happier.

Aureum Collective, founded by Cass DiMicco and Matthew L. Hoyle ’13, is a jewelry brand combining high quality metals with timelessly beautiful designs to create pieces that exude luxury and versatility. Hailing from backgrounds in fashion and finance, respectively, DiMicco and Hoyle decided to pursue their passion for design, marketing, and direct consumer interaction in 2019 by founding Aureum Collective. In a recent Zoom interview with The Harvard Crimson, the pair sat down to discuss their growing brand.
DiMicco and Hoyle were excited to talk about what inspired Aureum’s founding and what makes the brand stand out. Motivated by a hole they saw in the market, DiMicco and Hoyle wanted to create pieces that had a “high-fashion feel at a more accessible price point.” Hoyle emphasized on the Zoom call how 24-carat gold wasn’t prevalent in pieces they saw from other brands.
“It’s kind of like our brand ethos, it differentiates ourselves and really stands out when people wear it,” Hoyle said of their use of material.
According to DiMicco and Hoyle, Customer feedback is at the core of Aureum’s values. The brand launched in September of 2019 with an eight-piece collection, a short five months from its initial conception. Hoyle said this quick turnaround was made possible by direct communication with customers. “We really had this direct feedback that we used to design the pieces and design the company itself,” he said.
DiMicco left her corporate job several years prior to Aureum’s founding to become a full-time influencer. Around the same time, Hoyle left his finance job, giving the pair time to focus on getting the brand off the ground. Their experiences in fashion influencing and finance, while not directly related to their current work, helped DiMicco and Hoyle find their true passions and set them on this path. “It gave us a specific bit of professionalism, and working in a corporate environment helps when starting to run a company,” DiMicco said.
Aureum’s jewelry is a unique combination of effortless classical style and modern trends that remain wearable for months and years to come. When asked about design influences for Aureum’s pieces, DiMicco said her and Hoyle took inspiration from a variety of sources, from high-end fashion to trending time periods or colors to even the furniture in DiMicco’s home.
Though Aureum has seen success since its launch, DiMicco described the challenges they’ve faced finding people to join their team. While Hoyle and DiMicco have been at the helm since Aureum’s inception, giving up total control and hiring a team has been a difficult but necessary step. “Matt and I really pour our heart and soul into Aureum and work like seven days a week,” she said. “So finding people that will maybe share even just a fraction of that passion for it has been difficult,” DiMicco said.
Social media has also been invaluable to Aureum’s success. DiMicco has always wanted to start a brand and envisioned social media being a key part of that brand’s marketing. Of the brand’s aesthetics, DiMicco said, “We always put a lot of effort into what our packaging looks like and the unboxing, because we’ve had so many people who will share the unboxing of their Aureum products and it’s nice to have a more personable touch to everything we do.”
DiMicco and Hoyle are quite proud of the community that they’ve created through Aureum. Going beyond influencers, celebrities, and models, Aureum caters to a wider audience and encourages active engagement over social media.
Looking to the future, DiMicco said Aureum is in search of companies to do co-branded products and social shoots with. Hoyle and DiMicco hope to expand into categories beyond jewelry with brands that share their values.
Quality, style, and community are at the heart of Aureum Collective, making up the brand’s past, present, and undoubtedly its future. For now, readers can check out DiMicco’s Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok for more information on her work.

In early 1971, Terrell Don Hutto was the warden on a cotton plantation the size of Manhattan. About a decade later, he’d use lessons learned on the plantation to create something new, crude, and often in Harvard’s portfolio — the world’s first corporate prison.
Hutto began his career in incarceration on the Ramsey Prison Farm in the 60s.
In many ways, Ramsey was a typical Southern prison. After slavery’s abolition, former Confederate states realized the 13th Amendment handed them a path forward. “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude” would exist in the U.S., it declared, “except as a punishment for crime.” So states with economies bruised by emancipation eyed prison labor as new fuel for the old slave economy. They purchased plantations, attached them to prisons, and began filling them with Black men — many for crimes, like selling crops without a white person’s permission, invented to incarcerate them.
When Hutto ran Ramsey, every Black person it imprisoned was forced to work the cotton plantation, plus a fraction of the prison’s few white prisoners. Dusk to dawn, they picked cotton across sprawling fields. None were paid. Slow hands in the field often meant solitary confinement or being fed a punishment diet, which one man testified he lost 30 pounds on. Academics flocked to Texas to document the old slave songs, reaching back to West Africa, that rang out on its prison plantations.
In the 1960s, plantation prisons brought Texas $14.7 million annually in today’s dollars. Hutto’s success running them like labor camps for startling profits led to every Arkansas prison being placed in his care.
In 1978, the Supreme Court Case Hutto v. Finney ruled that, under Hutto’s leadership, Arkansas’ prison system committed “cruel and unusual punishment.” Testimony revealed the cruelty reserved for those on his fields who missed cotton quotas: the “Texas TV” — you pressed your forehead against the wall, took several steps back, and were forced to hold that stance for hours upon hours, often after being stripped naked — and forcing cuffed inmates onto the hood of a truck, then driving them at breakneck speed across the plantation. Many fell.
Luckily, this history didn’t shake investors.
At Ramsey, Terrell Don Hutto learned to view incarceration as a lucrative industry. Like most successful founders, he was just slightly ahead of the curve.
By the 1980s, the war on drugs had engulfed state legislatures. Annual spending on prisons quadrupled and, in a decade, the prison population nearly doubled. America scrambled for space to incarcerate everyone it convicted.
To Hutto and his co-founders, this looked like demand. They wondered: Could they transfigure this influx of people behind bars into profit?
So on Valentine’s Day, 1983, Hutto co-founded the Corrections Corporation of America — a company whose product would be the imprisonment of people in detention centers it’d build, own, and operate. In 2016, after a scathing Department of Justice report declared private prisons unsafe, the company rebranded as CoreCivic.
Hutto’s cofounders were Tom Beasley — a former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party who brought political connections — and Robert Crants, a Harvard Law and Business School graduate with real estate know-how and the legitimacy Harvard confers.
They wooed shareholders with the pitch that, far from uncouth, explicitly introducing profit motives to incarceration would foster competition and consequently improve conditions. Beasley bragged: “We’re the best thing that ever happened to corrections since they stopped beating ’em.”
If only.

Since CoreCivic opened its door 40 years ago, prison privatization has been a race to the bottom — which, in this context, is torture.
Charles A. Fried, a Harvard Law Professor and Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan, is a vocal opponent of Harvard’s investments in private prisons.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on this article. A spokesperson for the Harvard Management Company did not respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon.
Fried’s high-level post in the Reagan administration — the militant drug policies which helped birth CoreCivic — has led some to paint him as an unlikely objector.
But to him, the case against profiting off prisons is obvious.
Fried describes prison to me as “a kind of prolonged mutilation.”
When you incarcerate someone, “you take over a large part of a person's life, the totality of it, for a period of years, or months, or decades.” This degree of domination, he emphasizes, is “drastic.”
“What you're doing is, in principle, a very terrible thing. To do it right is expensive.”
He articulates the danger of for-profit prisons simply.
“Corporations have the obligation to their shareholders to be profitable. And that is inconsistent with the obligation which the government has to its prisoners and to wider society” — which is to behave humanely.
Prison operators fight tooth-and-nail to expand incarceration. The pursuit of profit leads them to imprison people, for similar sentences, months longer than their public counterparts. In the 1990s, CoreCivic began building prisons “on spec” — before a contract for a new prison was even signed, assuming need. Tellingly, prison operators have spent tens of millions successfully lobbying Congress for harsher sentencing laws, and block carceral reform.
Bribery is also on the table. In the infamous “Kids for Cash” scandal, judges were caught accepting bribes from private prison executives to imprison kids for offenses, including fighting in class, where lighter sentencing was warranted: inflating the population and profits of juvenile prisons.
“So, the private prison system encourages — and of course, its corporate rate on debt encourages — longer terms of imprisonment for more people” Fried tells me. “It's more business, which is exactly the opposite incentive that we want.”
He describes the for-profit prison as “a kind of slow-motion version of the death penalty.”
In 2014, while undercover in a CoreCivic prison, investigative journalist Shane Bauer saw a man lose both his legs and every finger to gangrene after his nine requests to visit a doctor were ignored.
Claudio Fajardo Saucedo, a man held in a Texas for-profit prison, complained at least 18 times over two years of ratcheting pain, only to be handed Tylenol and denied access to a doctor. Eventually, he collapsed and, at a local hospital, was instantly diagnosed with a treatable virus that killed him days later. This extreme medical neglect, highlighted by reporter Seth Wessler, was found to be pervasive.
“Essentially, the private prison system is a way for the state to ignore its moral obligations,” Fried tells me.
Most major banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, cut ties with private prison companies in 2019, citing these abuses. Columbia University divested from private prisons in 2015.
Still, Harvard has decided to hold on.
***
CoreCivic is now the country’s largest private prison operator; GEO Group is close behind. Both are publicly traded, and, alone, manage over half of America’s private prison contracts.
Through investments in these companies, Harvard’s $53.2 billion endowment grows each time their prisons fill a cell or cut a corner.
Or at least, it definitely did until the end of the last financial quarter. And might still. And surely will again.
It’s complicated.
CoreCivic, GEO Group, G4S, and Serco. These are the for-profit prison operators Harvard invests its endowment in, and consequently reaps returns from when they ink lucrative prison contracts.
Harvard’s investment in prison companies is contained within two exchange-traded funds — bundles of hundreds of companies any investor can place in their portfolio with a few clicks.
In a 2019 meeting with student activists, University President Lawrence S. Bacow admitted Harvard had $18,000 invested in private prison operators through two ETFs. This calculation excludes potential private prison investments contained in the 98 percent of Harvard’s portfolio it is not federally mandated to disclose, despite Bacow’s access to this staggeringly fuller picture.
Harvard’s most recent filings reveal that, in the last quarter of 2021, HMC sold every ETF it invests in. This means Harvard has sold the slim part of its endowment publicly known to be invested in private prisons.
Yet this ETF dump is not a moral statement or divestment, which implies a commitment to scrubbing an entity from your portfolio permanently.
As soon as they become profitable, Harvard will surely purchase ETFs again, including those containing for-profit prisons. It may already have. This coming quarter’s SEC filings will tell.
This moment — when whether Harvard bets billions on more people being imprisoned is a question and not dreadfully certain — begs: Why can’t Harvard just quit private prisons?
Since 2018, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign has called for Harvard to divest from the prison-industrial complex, which it defines as private prison operators and other players like bail bondsmen and taser manufacturers.
Harvard administrators have met with prison divestment activists but dismiss them. Rather, they hold the party line: How Harvard invests its money is apolitical and irrelevant. The endowment exists to feed itself and is beholden to no other aim. Bacow says students find many industries “offensive.” Do they really expect him to hear out the case against each one?
In a 2019 press release, Harvard Divinity School graduate and HPDC organizer Ismail Buffins wrote: “Harvard gets to look good by meeting with us. But of course, they’ll just dangle the carrot on the stick forever.”
The idea that Harvard’s endowment exists in a realm detached from societal consequences is directly contradicted by modern instances in which Harvard chose to divest.
In 1986, from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa.
In 1990, from the entire tobacco industry.
In 2005, from a company tied to the Darfur genocide.
And, perhaps most famously, its 2021 pledge to halt investments in the fossil fuel industry.
On Earth Day 2020 Harvard pledged its endowment would be carbon neutral by 2050. To simultaneously announce, with fanfare, socially conscious endowment decisions while scorning the idea HMC managers should consider ethics is obvious hypocrisy. Clearly, the endowment is only apolitical when grappling with Harvard’s investments gets sticky.
Bacow has conceded that his endowment philosophy has given way to rare exceptions. Why doesn’t the cruelty of corporate prisons qualify?
Fried chalks it up to “a lack of imagination.”
***
Terell Don Hutto passed away in 2021 after dedicating much of his life to running CoreCivic. How long his company and for-profit prison model can outlive him is an open question.
“If private prison businesses were to be treated as a pariah, I think they would die,” Fried tells me.
“The fact is, of course, organizations like Harvard have a great deal of leverage over the mutual funds and the private equity funds, and generally how they do things,” he argues.
“If they said to a Fidelity, or Vanguard, or some other private equity groups, ‘No, we will not invest with you, as long as you have private prisons in your portfolio,’ they wouldn't have them. It's clear that that's what would happen.”
There’s precedent. Companies including BlackRock, which manages one of the ETFs Harvard has prison investments through, have created new funds that exclude other contested industries, including weapon manufacturers. It’s easy to imagine asset management firms providing investors the option to select ETFs which don’t bet on the profitability of incarceration.
The for-profit prison industry has already shown it’s susceptible to divestment blows. When major banks cut ties with private prison companies — cutting an estimated $2.4 billion in loans to industry giants GEO Group and CoreCivic — both companies' stock prices nose-dived. Their stocks similarly plunged over 40 percent when the Obama administration announced in 2016 it would restrict the Justice Department’s use of for-profit prisons, and again in 2021 when the Biden administration announced a similar measure.
So what’s been keeping private prison operators afloat?
The same thing that keeps any stock afloat: Faith.
Through investing in private prisons, Harvard actively affirms the idea that incarceration is a financially and morally viable industry to put money in. Divestment, then, is a wedge to erode that faith.
The divestment spring witnessed after Harvard announced its intended fossil fuel divestments — many universities and trusts followed suit — demonstrates that Harvard has considerable power to shape how others invest. Harvard pulling its investments in private prisons has the potential to deal the final blow to this kneeling industry.
Instead, Harvard is helping CoreCivic weather the storm.
Fried paints Harvard’s willingness to profit from imprisonment as the result of passivity. “Many institutions have refused, for instance, to have even a smidgen of tobacco stocks in their portfolios. So I think it's a kind of laziness, a moral laziness, which allows this.”
These portfolio decisions suggest our institution’s concern for the torture of prisoners ranks somewhere below our distaste for cigarettes and misleading advertising.
Yet the line connecting slavery and modern private prisons is straight and glaring. If we can see the evil in big tobacco, how can we not see the evil in profiting, however marginally, from the imprisonment and torture of the over 100,000 people held in America’s private prisons? Of propping up a model we could help erase?
Maybe we view the suffering of anyone convicted as justified. Or think of their lives as too foreign to our own.
What does it mean for the richest university in the world — one which has dedicated $5 million dollars to plumbing its relationship to the institution of slavery, and sent out countless emails affirming its anti-racist commitments — to continue to seek profits from, and therefore uphold, America’s last legal home for slavery?
It means we’re not being serious.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nation’s harrowing mental health crisis has offered a ripe opportunity for bipartisan action, and the current administration has snatched it: Earlier this month, President Joe Biden touted his mental health care plans in his first-ever State of the Union address, including expanding access to telebehavioral health care coverage to every corner of the nation.
This is promising: Behavioral telehealth services — especially video therapy sessions — are demonstrably safe and effective, reduce administrative costs for providers, and ensure faster and more affordable access for those who are most struggling to enter and navigate the system. Dr. Risa L. Gold ’78, a New York psychiatrist who began offering video therapy at the height of the pandemic – and whose patients have swiftly embraced the benefits of the new modality – is highly hopeful that telehealth is “here to stay.”
Less promising, however, is the fact that the same opportunity for digital reformation hasn’t been grabbed at Harvard. The University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has been pierced by daggers of excess capacity — leaving gaping holes in their provision of mental health care. But while a brief stint with the telemental health care provider iHope back in 2017 offered some hope, the prompt shut-down of the system suggests that, if anything, Harvard seems to be moving in the wrong direction.
The lackluster character of CAMHS’ virtual options becomes particularly pressing when brought into conversation with the importance of early mental health intervention at colleges. There exists an evidence-based need for colleges to build mental health support systems that are proactive, rather than reactive, according to Dr. Caitlin M. Nevins, instructor in Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Yet from the student standpoint, Harvard’s approach embodies reactivity to a tee — those in need of urgent support are given priority to skip ahead on CAMHS’ months-long waiting lines, while those with less immediately dire concerns are left to wait.
Telehealth, according to Nevins, is “adding more resources, but it's doing it in a way that I think can happen a lot quicker for students.”
In the face of such strained choices, CAMHS’ prioritization of crisis intervention over prevention is the safest, most straightforward of moves. What remains problematic is the fact that such impossible trade-offs stand so firmly in the first place. That problem is, to be sure, largely attributable to CAMHS’ seemingly unchangeable funding strains. But on some level, these trade-offs are also self-imposed. Unwittingly, I suspect, CAMHS has spent years scrambling within a maze that has become outlined by boundaries of its own creation, too busy dealing with immediate, short-term crises to address surmountable long-term shortcomings.
The fact that CAMHS’ most creative digital explorations are all internally based serves as a testament to this point. As of today, CAMHS offers a series of digital group sessions led by their own clinicians, plus a tangled array of external links on their website. A new 24/7 hour hotline was also thrown into the mix this academic year, but it still fails to address the empirically-backed need for continuous, not sporadic, care. Worse still, students have been put on hold for what should be an on-demand 24/7 service — highlighting the limitations of working within CAMHS’ own strained internal ecosystem.
Let me be clear: CAMHS’ efforts are clearly well-intentioned. But that doesn’t change the difficult truth that their dedicated staff can’t fix this problem on their own. Ultimately, CAMHS continues to spend too much time working within the limited architecture of its own internal world – and nothing will change until it dives into the universe of opportunities that live beyond it.
Institutions like our own seem to have grown used to a very specific, short-term approach to behavioral care. “Do they have to rethink that, given what's going on in their student population? Rethink their role entirely, and their model?” Dr. Haiden Huskamp, Henry J. Kaiser Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, tellingly asked when we spoke on the phone in February.
Some colleges, in fact, are beginning to blaze such innovative external trails. Key among them, a chorus of community colleges across California, whose mental health teams managed to combat internal resource problems by partnering with TimelyMD, a telehealth company that specializes in higher education. Duke and the University of Virginia have also entered the video therapy domain, and other schools have made similarly innovative moves – including Penn State, which began this year by offering students three months of free access to telehealth behavioral coaching using an evidence-based messaging service.
The impact of these offerings speaks for itself: As Harvard’s students watch the clock tick away with wait times of six weeks, some of these schools have been able to bid farewell to ungodly wait times entirely. And as wait times themselves repeatedly deter prospective patients from seeking care, telehealth actively pulls students in: In one case study, 82 percent of student patients reported that, if digital services had not been available to them, they would have “done nothing.”
But doing nothing — or what feels like nothing, compared to the options offered by Harvard’s more innovative peers — is rarely enough. The precedents set elsewhere illustrate that Harvard has been entrapping itself within a prison of avoidable trade-offs — plagued by impossible choices that, with digital innovation and expansion, it wouldn’t be so pressed to make.
Ultimately, to achieve their desired ends, CAMHS needs to stop dipping its toes within familiar yet shallow waters; and to instead submerge itself within the expansive sea of online possibilities out there — head, neck, toes, and all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Vice President Emmet E. de Kanter ’24 unveiled the final draft for a new student body constitution in an email to undergraduates Monday.
The draft, if passed, would entirely dismantle the current UC structure, replacing it with the "Harvard Undergraduate Association," a body led by two co-presidents and made up of fewer elected members managing seven issue-focused teams.
In their email, Cheng and de Kanter solicited student signatures to place the draft constitution before a school-wide referendum, which would take place between March 28 and April 1.
In order to take effect, the HUA constitution must be ratified with over two-fifths of the student body turning out to vote and a two-thirds majority voting in favor — a threshold that was controversially raised by the UC in the weeks leading up to Cheng’s inauguration.
Cheng also claimed that more than $125,000 of UC funding has been withheld from the body by the Dean of Students Office in response to an ongoing audit of the UC’s finances by Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services. The audit — a central plank of Cheng’s campaign platform — would be required to take place every three years under the new constitution.
If the new form of student government takes hold, Cheng and de Kanter pledged in the email to return this money to students via “direct refund checks,” but Cheng admitted in an interview that the exact form of repayment was pending.
Assistant Dean Kate Colleran, who has previously acted as a mediator for the body and represents the Dean of Students Office, did not respond to an inquiry about the withheld funding.
The new constitution was drafted over the course of several months by the Citizens’ Assembly, a group of randomly-selected undergraduate students convened by Cheng for this purpose.
The HUA constitution differs radically from the body’s current governing documents. It spans just 11 pages, a stark departure from the 59 of the current UC constitution.
“It is a lot shorter than the UC constitution, but it has everything you need,” Cheng said in an interview.
But other members of the UC saw the document’s short stature as a downside.
Dunster Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24 defended the length of the current constitution in an interview in late February.
“It's big for sure, but it's a complex document,” Taylor said. “All constitutions for all organizations that fill complex roles, like the UC, are going to be complex documents.”
In another proposed change, financial grants for clubs would be distributed through semesterly budget requests or monthly grant applications. Any requests above a designated threshold, which is yet to be determined, would be at the discretion of the treasurer, while any amount under the threshold will be handled by the finance team with approval from the treasurer. The document promises clubs will receive their funding “within 1 week of [their] application being approved.”
Leadership would also shift drastically from its current form. The HUA constitution details a system in which two co-presidents, running on a single ticket, are elected by the student body to serve a one-year term.
The co-presidents would preside over seven teams — finance, social life, extracurriculars, academic, residential life, well-being, and sports — each led by a popularly elected “officer.”
These teams would be staffed by volunteering students, deemed “team members,” who would work on specific projects. These project teams would be managed by “team leaders” appointed by the officers.
It is a structure that has previously drawn criticism from some UC members.
In an interview earlier this month, Kirkland Representative Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 called a previous draft of the proposed constitution a “pretty ridiculous proposal,” fearing that the structure would lead to nepotism.
Lowell Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24, a member of the Citizens’ Assembly, disagreed in an interview earlier this month.
“It confuses me that people would think that a system of committee chairs elected by a 40 member council would have more integrity than a team officer elected by the whole student body,” she said.
Acknowledging some reservations around the proposed structure, Cheng remained confident that the proposal would pass.
“It’s not gonna be perfect — no systems are perfect — but I think it’s hard to do worse than the UC,” Cheng said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With indoor mask-wearing now recommended — but not required — at Harvard College, undergraduates have been left to decide for themselves whether to mask up in most indoor spaces.
Harvard lifted its mask mandate on March 14, when the City of Cambridge ended its own requirement. But the change came on the heels of a surge in cases among undergraduates in the four weeks prior to spring break, when 765 College students tested positive for the virus.
Because of the spike, the school rolled out “College-specific” guidelines that strongly recommend mask-wearing in common spaces and prohibit non-sponsored social gatherings in indoor residential spaces. The College also increased the undergraduate testing cadence to three times per week until March 28.
In interviews this week, some students expressed apprehension about the timing of the change — which came during spring break — while many others said they were relieved the school is rolling back restrictions.
“I kind of wish we’d wait it off a little bit, especially with everyone coming back for spring break,” said Jamal Nimer ’24.
Scott W. Arbery ’24 agreed the mask mandate was dropped “about a week premature,” but he said it was “about time” for Harvard to lift the requirement.
“I am surprised they did it this early,” said Robert M. “Bobby” McCarthy Jr. ’23.
Others said they trust the school to handle public health decisions.
“I personally trust the administration when it comes to data and health-based decisions they are making,” said Daniel Shin ’22.
In an email on March 7 announcing the changes to the school’s masking policies, Harvard’s top administrators wrote that “despite the large number of reported cases, there have been very few hospitalizations and no Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions this year.”
“Although public health authorities have concluded that the virus causing COVID is likely to continue to circulate among us like the cold or flu, the risks it poses for the health of our community can be managed effectively with less intrusive measures than before,” the email read.
Mask-usage has been mixed, with some students eager to pull them off and others more apprehensive.
“It’s not necessarily something I feel comfortable with taking off yet,” said Sonya R. Ganeshram ’24. “It’s important to protect my own health, but also protect the health of the people around me.”
Other undergrads are comfortable saying goodbye to face coverings with case counts down across the country.
“I feel comfortable not wearing it,” said Sawyer B. Cooper ’24.
Still, he said, “If I’m ever in doubt of whether I am healthy or not, then I’ll wear a mask.”
Niara C. Botchwey ’23, who previously contracted Covid-19, said she would be personally comfortable taking off her mask. However, she said she would continue to wear one in common spaces out of respect for others.
“Particularly in common spaces, for people like dining hall workers that need to be here, I think it just makes sense to have that sense of safety for them,” she said.
Some students said they would take a hybrid approach, continuing to mask in crowded areas, but not small groups.
“I’ll probably keep masking for now,” Nimer said. “Maybe not in smaller social environments — but in bigger social environments, I’ll absolutely be masked and probably encouraging some of my friends to stay masked for now.”
Others said they would wait to see how case numbers look post-spring break before making a decision.
“My plan right now is to continue wearing a mask,” George C. Guarnieri III ’22 said. “I’m definitely open to taking off by the end of the semester, obviously seeing how things go.”

UPDATED: March 22, 2022 at 3:40 p.m.
The Harvard Divinity School will increase its stipend payouts for need-based and merit scholarship packages beginning this fall.
The change, which was announced by HDS Dean David N. Hempton earlier this month, will apply to incoming and returning students.
The Divinity School currently provides three levels of need-based financial aid — a package covering 75 percent of tuition, a second package that covers full tuition, and a third that covers full tuition and provides a stipend. The change will increase stipend amounts, but need-based aid that covers tuition will remain the same.
“Our grant aid packages of 75 percent and 100 percent will remain the same, but HDS remains committed to working to identify opportunities to continue to strengthen our aid programs in the years to come,” Tim Whelsky, HDS’s associate dean for enrollment and student services, said in a Q&A posted on the Divinity School’s website.
Whelsky said in the Q&A that the change reflects increases in the cost of living for students.
“Our hope is that the new stipend levels will allow us to provide meaningful support to our students and keep pace with the rising cost of living,” he said.
In a message sent to HDS affiliates announcing the change, Hempton wrote that the stipend increases would help make the school more accessible to students.
“This latest increase in vital financial support will enhance both our merit and need-based offerings and ensure an HDS education is accessible to a greater number of students,” Hempton wrote. “Our commitment to investing in our students will open doors of opportunity and will serve to strengthen HDS overall.”
Whelsky added that the increase in stipend amounts for merit packages will help HDS remain competitive.
“While our need-based programs are our priority and comprise much of the aid we award, merit awards remain a valuable tool for helping us stay competitive amongst other institutions who only award based on academic merit,” he said in the Q&A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie analyzed the state of the Republican party and President Joe Biden’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in a Harvard Institute of Politics Forum on Monday.
Christie served two terms as governor from 2010 to 2018 and briefly ran for president in the 2016 election before dropping out of the race following a loss in the Republican New Hampshire primary. Harvard Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen moderated the event alongside Bridget K. Toomey ’23.
When asked about the Biden administration’s response to the war in Ukraine, Christie criticized the United States’ relations with Russia throughout the last two decades.
“To look at it just as a Biden administration technique is to not really understand the nature of the crisis,” he said. “This crisis, in my view, really started in 2008 when President Bush, 43, took a rather passive approach to Vladimir Putin’s entry into Georgia.”
Christie added he believes former President Barack Obama also did not adequately react to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, setting a precedent that failed to deter Putin from invading Ukraine.
He also said he thinks pressuring Russia to completely withdraw from Ukraine would be “an impossible task” and called for the United States to follow the lead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in any future negotiations.
“I think we should be guided in large measure by what Zelenskyy is willing to accept,” Christie said. “And if Zelenskyy is willing to accept something that doesn’t morally offend us, we should be willing to back them up.”
Looking forward to the 2022 midterm elections, Christie was optimistic about the Republican party’s future, predicting the party may assume a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. He noted, however, that the Senate may pose a larger challenge for the Republican party.
“It’s tougher math in the Senate for Republicans in 2022,” Christie said. “So I’m not supremely confident we’ll take the Senate, but I think it’s more likely than not.”
“I am supremely confident we’ll take the house, as long as we don’t do anything stupid,” he added.
Mikaël H. Scaramucci ’22, who attended the forum, said he was eager to hear different political perspectives regarding the country’s future.
“I’m always open to hearing other perspectives and other opinions, and Chris Christie has been a bit more critical on some aspects of Trump and the political party,” he said. “I thought I’d want to hear him out because he’d do so in good faith here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Professor Danielle S. Allen, who recently ended her bid for governor of Massachusetts, spoke at a panel on Black history at the Cambridge Forum on Monday.
Harvard Law School Professor Randall L. Kennedy and Cheryl T. Gilkes, a professor at Colby College and a pastor at Union Baptist Church in Cambridge, spoke as panelists alongside Allen. The event also featured introductory remarks from Cambridge City Councilor E. Denise Simmons and was moderated by PBS producer and filmmaker Roberto Mighty.
The event, entitled “Black History: On Rewind,” was co-hosted by the Cambridge Forum, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and the Harvard Square Business Association. The Lincoln Institute is a think tank that advises local, national, and international governments and organizations on land policy.
Launching the discussion, Mighty confessed that witnessing Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 become the first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court has been very emotional.
“What made me want to cry about this? Why is this so important?” he said.
Kennedy admitted to feeling “choked up” in response to the nomination as well, attributing the emotion to the centuries-long lack of racial and gender diversity on the court.
“The fact that this is a first says something — that’s an indictment of our country and that’s something about which everyone should be very sad,” he said.
But Kennedy also acknowledged the progress that led to Jackson’s historic nomination.
“There is a tremendous struggle that has been waged to make this day possible,” he said. “I bet she will be confirmed, and that will be wonderful.”
Allen — who has spent the past few months on the campaign trail discussing the challenges Massachusetts faces — cited the immense racial wealth gap in Boston as evidence that an understanding of the history of racism is crucial for addressing today’s challenges.
“The median wealth held by a white family in Boston is $250,000. For an African American family, it’s $8,” she said.
Denise A. Jilson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said in an interview after the panel that she began planning the event to celebrate Cambridge’s history of giving a platform to Black social justice leaders.
“It occurred to me that, really, what we ought to be doing is having an event that celebrates the Cambridge Forum,” she said. “Because for 50 years, Harvard Square — through the forum at First Parish — had been celebrating and welcoming Black leaders to our community to talk about these really hard issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An around-the-world finish on a bullet of a feed from first-year midfielder Owen Gaffney to junior attackman Hayden Cheek set the tone for a week of decisive play by the men's lacrosse team as it toppled two ranked opponents, Michigan and Brown. The wins set up Harvard well for conference play, as the team enters the season with a 4-1 record.
The Crimson battled against The University of Michigan on Saturday, March 12. At the time of defeat, it was ranked no. 13 with a 7-0 record. Harvard came in with a sense of determination to prove itself, as the young team took on its second ranked opponent in almost two years.
The squad took control of the game as it made plays on both ends, playing a solid game all around the field. The attack was able to pick apart the Wolverine defense with coherent and connected sets. The offensive effectively drew the Michigan slides, which enabled them to move the ball quickly to open players as the defensive rotations were a step behind. Junior midfielder Nick Loring is a great example of this as he facilitated play with five assists and two goals. The veteran commented that the win came down to the team’s grit.
“It was a hard-fought, full team win. Our guys fought till the final whistle and made plays on both sides of the ball that allowed us to stay ahead for most of the game and hold off some of their runs. Obviously any time you’re playing a top-15, undefeated team you know it’s going to be a battle but I think we proved to ourselves that regardless of the opponent, we can play at a really high level,” he said.
Gaffney said that the team worked hard on cleaning up the offense. An emphasis in practice was on looking for the right, simple, play instead of forcing the ball.
“I think we were all motivated by our past three games, win or loss,” Gaffney said. “We knew what we could do as a team, and we just needed to prove it to ourselves. We obviously have much more to work on, but it was nice to get a win against a great team.”
Gaffney was particularly complimentary not only of his offensive unit, but of the defense as well.
“I think our defense played a great game. Michigan has a great offense, and our defense was really impressive in stopping them. Kyle Mullin really took charge and led our defense and team as a whole.”
The defense was strong on and off the ball as it solidly forced the Michigan team to stretch its field and was quick to talk through its slide packages. The unit was scrappy on ground balls and sent two or three to box out, a major change from the team’s last showing. This gave Harvard a much higher percentage of possessions, and set the team up for clean and quick clears.
The team won 14-9 after senior goalie Kyle Mullin saved two buzzer beater attempts by Michigan with about twenty seconds left on the clock. This shut-down mentality carried into their next game against no. 15 Brown, in which The Crimson won its first league contest of the season.
This past Saturday, The Crimson took on its first Ivy League competitor in its home game against Brown. Harvard built on a lot of what it did well against Michigan, but also had some areas in which the team needed to improve for later games.
An area to focus on would be the face off, as Harvard had difficulty winning that aspect of the game cleanly. The game against Michigan started off favoring the Wolverines until senior fogo Steven Cuccurullo was able to figure out how to get the ball out of the initial clamp in order to factor in the solid play of the wings, which was driven by a rotation of guys including sophomore lsm Greg Campisi and first-year defensive-middie Andrew O’Berry. The Brown game exposed this weakness despite Mullin and the defense warding off countless fast-break attempts. Harvard went 4 for 26, which is something that the team needs to work on in order to capitalize on possession time.
The defense, led by Mullin, who had 18 saves, did a phenomenal job locking down the players flying in for the fast break, and did a heads-up job of talking through these faster sets. The team excelled at communicating for the entirety of play, and forced Brown to play wider and sloppier than it had been. Harvard looked solid on ground balls and cleared really well.
The offense capitalized on its possession time and put in action the mantra of smart shots over volume of shots, like Gaffney noted after the Michigan game. Cheek was a standout, facilitating play on the offensive end with four goals.
“Our offense worked well off the ball. We found great opportunities and didn’t force shots," Cheek said. “We need to focus on clearing the ball as well as getting extra opportunities in special teams situations.”
Cheek is looking forward to the game on Tuesday, March 22nd in which Harvard will take on No. 12 Boston University on Jordan Field at 7 p.m.
“We are super excited about the opportunity to play another top 20 opponent in BU on Tuesday," he said. "I think we are playing at a high level right now but need to focus on ourselves and make sure we get better everyday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of the student body dispersed for a much-needed mid-semester recess, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (3-3, 1-0 Ivy League) traveled to Jacksonville, FL for two Spring Break matchups. Following a hard-fought loss on Monday to MAAC opponent Monmouth (5-3, 0-0), the Crimson came ready to battle with No. 20 Jacksonville (4-3, 0-0 ASUN) on Thursday. Despite two early goals from sophomore midfielder Maddie Barkate, the high-powered Jacksonville Dolphins stormed back and then some, defeating the Crimson 21-8.
“Those programs…the style of the game, are gonna give us a lot of good experience heading into this next stretch of games with our Ivy opponents,” said Harvard head coach Devon Wills. “Jacksonville was really skilled in some of the offenses that they were running against us. They were really patient defensively. So again, it kind of helped to prepare us even though it was a disappointing trip. You have to play these top 15 opponents to be prepared for your Ivy League games.”
The pair of goals by Barkate were quickly followed by eight Jacksonville goals to close out the first quarter of play. Although the Crimson fought an uphill battle for the remainder of the game, they certainly never gave in. As Harvard headed into the second quarter down seven, Coach Wills made a swap at the goalkeeper position, subbing in first-year goalie Lizzie Francioli for sophomore Chloe Provenzano, who already has 46 saves on the season. Wills commended both of her keepers, who constantly help each other improve even while competing for time.
“My mentality has been to always be ready if my name were to be called. At that point in the game I just wanted to do whatever I could to help my team. I was just thinking about trying to generate a little bit of offense and be a spark for the team,” said Francioli, who was recently cleared to return after an ACL injury. She made eight saves on the day, bringing that spark in the second quarter, though Harvard headed into the second half down 13-4.
Francioli and Provenzano are two of 19 underclassmen on the 33 member women’s lacrosse roster. In addition to the obvious inexperience of first years and sophomores due to the pandemic, it should be noted that the junior class also played very few games before the pandemic hit. Nevertheless, the group attacks every challenge and carries itself with an impressive maturity and levelheaded-ness on the field.
Seven of the eight goals contributed in the loss to the Dolphins were secured by sophomores. Along with Barkate, sophomore attacker Riley Campbell and midfielder Callie Hem each scored a pair of goals. Junior captain Grace Hulslander also contributed a beautiful diving goal from the crease. Three of these goals came in the third quarter, when the Crimson was able to match the tempo of Jacksonville, but it would not be enough.
“I'm just really pleased with how they've embraced the challenges of every different game and really how they've…handled themselves out on the field, both from a tactical standpoint as well as a mental standpoint,” Wills said when asked about the contributions of her younger players. “It's not always going to be about the X's and O's—but the process that they're embracing, and it’s really fun to watch.”
The team certainly reflects the optimism and drive of their coach, who gives credit to a talented and well-coached Jacksonville team, but also recognizes the potential of her squad.
“They are really eager. They want to keep learning. They want to keep competing. They have a vision for this program,” said Wills.
Francioli echoes the message of her coach when asked about what this game means for Harvard moving forward.
“Games like that give you an opportunity to show what your team is about and what we can do as a team,” said Francioli, referencing the challenge of playing a ranked opponent. “It was the perfect opportunity for us to gauge what we need to work on.”
The Crimson get their next opportunity to compete on Saturday, March 26th at home in an Ivy League matchup against Cornell.

Search history happens to be a closely guarded secret — it’s a ~window into our souls~. We all know that feeling when your friend grabs your phone and opens your browser — pure panic as every search you’ve done this week flashes before their eyes. They’ll know you searched for “Harry Potter fanfiction” and “how many states are there in the U.S.” (Obviously you knew it was 50 but just wanted confirmation.) The fear is too much to bear so you snatch your phone right back. Except now they’re even MORE curious.
People hold their search histories close to their chest, but I think it’s a constructive exercise to try to guess someone’s searches. So here, I will try my hand at guessing yours, dear reader, so long as you’re an undergraduate at Harvard (we’re a predictable bunch).
“What should I major in: personality quiz”
One thing I discovered early on in my first semester: No one really knows what they want to do. The ones that supposedly do have roughly an 80 percent chance of changing their mind at least once by the time they graduate. The other 20 percent question their life decisions on the regular but are too lazy to switch paths at this point.
“Finance jobs for people with a Folklore and Mythology degree”
That Harvard name will get us somewhere, right?
“How to tell people I go to Harvard without sounding pretentious”
A struggle that is somewhat niche, but an awkwardness many of us have encountered time and time again. How do you say it politely without sounding pretentious? At this point, I just say I go to college in the Boston area and people don’t question it a whole lot.
“Will I have a social life after getting quadded?”
Sweetie, did you have one before getting quadded? But I assure you, you can.
“What to do with my life now that I’m not pre-med”
See: next item. But for starters, you actually have a life now. I get it — being a pre-med is hard and now you suddenly have all this time on your hands. Well, I admire you all for choosing that route in the first place.
“How to get a job at McKinsey”
Nepotism is a great place to start!
“Is it possible to write a ten-page paper in four hours?”
Ten pages is pushing it, but five? No problem. It’s been a busy week, and you’ve been putting off that paper for English 20, and then it hits you. That essay is … due? Like, really soon. Time to hunker down with some Red Bull and crank out a paper at an inhuman speed. You no longer know what words you’re writing, but, by god, this paper is going to be done by 11:59.
“Why am I crying?”
First things first, walk out of Lamont and into the sunlight. But in all seriousness, it’s okay if you’re overwhelmed — we’re all under a lot of stress. You got this, babe <3
“Number of injuries by turkey 2021” or ”Can a college student take a turkey in a fight?”
The turkeys prowl campus just waiting to harass the next unsuspecting victim innocently trying to enter Lamont. One would be crazy to not be terrified that one of those oversized birds would come for them next. And yet some particularly confident students think they absolutely could KO one of the campus turkeys. My advice? Don’t even try. Those things are machines, built for destruction and war. Avoid at all costs.
“Is the Owl a birdwatching club?”
Literally what else would it be?
Well, there you have it. The search history of your average Harvard student. Of course, I could be wildly incorrect in my guesses for any given student on this campus, but I’d like to think I hit the mark for at least a few of you.
