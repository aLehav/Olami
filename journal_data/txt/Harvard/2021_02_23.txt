2018 was a big year for Asian American representation. Yes, because of “Bao” and “Patriot Act” and “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” and “Searching” and, of course, “Crazy Rich Asians,” but I would argue, far more because of the birth of “subtle asian traits” (the Facebook group that has become refuge for 1.9 million members of the Asian diaspora, filled with memes about being lactose intolerant or having an unpronounceable name). As uplifting as it is to see people who look like you on screen, it’s arguably more uplifting to know that others share your lived experience — that the little, subtle things are just as important as the crazy, rich ones. This is exactly what “Minari” is about: those infinite little things.
Inspired by writer-director Lee Isaac Chung’s childhood, “Minari” is set in the 1980s, but its characters are timeless. Jacob (Steven Yeun) and his wife Monica (Yeri Han) have just moved out to rural Arkansas with their children, Anne (Noel Cho) and the adorable David (Alan Kim), leaving California behind so Jacob can pursue his dream of running his own farm.
Not much happens in the film. Jacob works out in the field, the family goes to church, and at some point, the kids’ grandma Soonja (Yuh-jung Youn) shows up. It lacks the narrative breadth of “Tigertail” or the sweeping cultural clashes of “The Farewell” — opting instead for a subtler, relaxed sensibility; it feels less like a story and more like a portrait.
And in this portrait, subtle Asian traits abound: Monica picks earwax out of David’s ears; Soonja swears and doesn’t bake cookies “like a normal grandma.” At church, a girl asks Anne, “Can you stop me if I say something in your language?” and then proceeds to spout gibberish. As spot-on as these little things are, what’s more striking is what they add up to: the intangible feeling of being an Asian American immigrant, a feeling that Chung argues is wrought with struggle — not just against the land and people around you, but also within yourself.
Jacob is Chung’s centerpiece: a man who is both addicted to the American dream and staunchly skeptical of it. “Korean people use their heads,” he says to David, mocking a salesman touting a water-detecting stick and opting, instead, to dig his own well. But he quickly runs out of water, forced to drain the rest of the family’s water supply to grow a crop of vegetables that he ultimately cannot sell. It’s a Steinbeckian image, for sure — a man persevering against forces beyond his control — and one that Chung posits as quintessentially American too, despite what the HFPA says.
This isn’t to say, however, that Jacob is a passive victim of a difficult immigrant journey. He is consumed by his desire to build up his farm, to achieve that rustic American Dream, even at the cost of his family’s well-being. His is a case study in the Asian and American blend of toxic masculinity.
And Soonja is, in many ways, Jacob’s foil: a Korean grandmother who wears men’s underwear around the house, spends afternoons watching wrestling on TV, takes money from the church collection basket, and — most importantly — loves her grandson unconditionally. Youn’s performance is delightful and heartwarming, filled with enough charm to uplift an otherwise heavy-hearted film.
The film is not depressing, per se — in fact, it ends on quite a hopeful note — it’s just subdued and unglamorous. The production design definitely helps; the trailer is sparse and homey, but also distinctly Asian American. It’s not like there are Korean flags and paper lanterns dotting the walls: Once again, it's the little things — the patterns on the bed sheets, the sauces lining the kitchen counter.
And when you add up all the little things, it does become a film about the big things, too: family, spirituality, Mountain Dew. It touches on the struggles of being a working-class family, the importance of ethnic networks, and the resilience of the immigrant spirit — all without smacking the audience over the head with poverty porn and racial slurs.
A film about little things can, at times, be frustrating. Chung is very good at defusing tension, often right before it reaches its peak. Then again, that’s probably closer to how the world really works, right? Most ignorant comments aren’t made by a racist, pimple-faced school bully. Most family arguments don’t come to explosive, marriage-ruining ends. And “Minari” shows us exactly that.
“Minari” is a beautiful film. Yes, because of its grounded, lush depiction of rural America, but also because of the story it tells: the immigrant experience — the American experience — and all its idiosyncrasies, its ups and downs, and its unparalleled beauty.

Nearly a year after the release of “Future Nostalgia,” Dua Lipa continues to capitalize on the success of her sophomore album. The deluxe re-release “Future Nostalgia (The Moonlight Edition),” which Lipa teased on Instagram, takes listeners on another journey back to the future. Lipa says that the original album “served as a form of escapism” for her around the time of its release, as it did for many of her fans. Coupled with an escape from “timelines, deadlines, people telling me what to do,” Lipa says that she has since been able to “make something that [she] really loves.” Listeners will surely also appreciate how “The Moonlight Edition” departs nicely from the cohesiveness of the original album, incorporating a variety of different styles and speaking more to Lipa’s diverse musical ability and development as an artist.
On the day of the reissue, Lipa released its promotional single, “We’re Good,” an unconventional breakup song that strays vastly from Dua Lipa’s usual electro-pop style. With lines like “Let’s end this like we should and say we’re good,” combined with a much calmer tropical beat, “We’re Good” explores the idea of an amicable break-up with a partner. This provides both thematic and sonic contrasts to some of the original record’s tracks such as “Break My Heart.” Mixing elements of dance-pop and disco-funk, “Break My Heart” is a high-energy, upbeat track all about vulnerability, as Lipa expresses her concern that a new lover could leave her brokenhearted. Lipa’s desire for a much more idealistic end to a relationship in “We’re Good” gives listeners a glimpse into her growth during the past ten months, a time that she says helped her develop self-confidence and become the “best performer [she] could be.”
After “If It Ain’t Me” was originally leaked as a collaboration between Dua Lipa and ex-Fifth Harmony member Normani, many fans were disappointed when they found out that “The Moonlight Edition” featured a solo version of the song instead. As catchy as the sad but danceable love song may be, with similarly upbeat tracks such as “Don’t Start Now” and “Break My Heart” already in the album, “If It Ain’t Me” does not add anything new to “Future Nostalgia.” In contrast to the innovative composition of “We’re Good,” “If It Ain’t Me” appeals more to Lipa’s original sound ultimately seeming like an unnecessary addition.
The re-release’s next new solo track, “That Kind Of Woman,” is a retro love song filled with energetic ‘80s beats and synths. As its title suggests, “That Kind Of Woman” drips with a new confidence Lipa said lockdown helped her gain, with lines such as “I’ll pick you from the crowd / Don’t come to me.” This track complements the more positive themes of love and personal growth on “We’re Good.” “That Kind Of Woman” also seems to suggest that Lipa now has the confidence to take an energetic charge in her romantic pursuits, which fits in nicely with the ideas of female empowerment found in “Boys Will Be Boys.” “That Kind Of Woman” is a wonderful contribution to “The Moonlight Edition,” as it effortlessly displays Lipa’s growth as both an artist and an individual.
In addition to new solo tracks, “The Moonlight Edition” also introduces a variety of different features from Angèle, DaBaby, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, Tainy, JID, and Miley Cyrus. After Lipa’s first multilingual feature with the K-pop group BLACKPINK on her self-titled debut album, tracks such as “Un Día (One Day)” with J Balvin, Tainy, and Bad Bunny, and “Fever” with Angèle add to Lipa’s growing list of bilingual bops. Unfortunately, JID’s and DaBaby’s features both diverge from Lipa’s typical style and don’t seem like worthwhile additions. Lipa’s song with Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, “Prisoner (feat. Dua Lipa),” is arguably one of the best new additions to Lipa’s discography. By mixing elements of punk, disco, and pop, the duo elevate each other rather than competing.
While Dua Lipa may not be going on tour anytime soon, her newly released “Future Nostalgia (The Moonlight Edition)” is sure to help listeners through quarantine with a variety of different dance bops, features, and unconventional breakup songs to sing and dance along to while they recreate their own Dua Lipa World Tour in their living rooms.

This review includes minor spoilers from Season One of “Bridgerton” on Netflix.
“Bridgerton,” the latest series to take Netflix by storm, is based on a series of eight historical romance novels by Julia Quinn ‘92. Each novel focuses on one Bridgerton sibling as they meet and fall in love with their eventual spouse. While the plot of the first season of Netflix’s adaptation was mostly based on the first book in the series, it also borrowed storylines from several others and created entirely new ones as well. Each book offers something individual, even as the series is unified by tropes of the genre and Quinn’s distinctive style.
The novel that primarily inspired Season one is aptly titled “The Duke and I” as it focuses solely on Simon and Daphne. Where the Netflix adaptation explored the dynamics of the family, this book — and indeed those that follow — are exclusively about one main pairing. While the show presents Daphne with multiple possible suitors, the novel presents only Simon. Additionally, there is a greater exploration of the continued impacts of Simon’s stammer on his life and Daphne’s struggle with looking for love when she is always viewed as the friend rather than the bride. They continue to have enjoyable chemistry and witty repartee in the book, so its insular nature is not a drawback. Unfortunately, however, one of the most problematic elements of the show — when Daphne finds out Simon has been lying to her about his infertitlity she decides to rape him — is somehow far worse in the book. Simon is drunk and asleep and Daphne holds him down. Daphne never regrets her actions, and the narrative never holds her accountable. It is shocking this flew as a plot point, even in 2000, and that it remained, if in a more sanitised form, in the 2020 show. It causes unconscionable harm to the story and has no place in what is purportedly to be light-hearted, escapist romance.
Despite continued criticism about the show’s shallow handling of issues concerning race, gender, and consent, Netflix has greenlit “Bridgerton” for a second season that seems to plan to pull from the second book, “The Viscount Who Loved Me,” about eldest child Anthony’s complicated courtship with a Miss Kate Sheffield. Thankfully, all of the most harmful tropes are absent from this novel. It is arguably the most enjoyable, with a brave, selfless and funny romantic lead who challenges all of Anthony’s previously held convictions. It’s about overcoming unresolved childhood trauma, being ultra-competitive as a way of showing affection, the value of familial love and the unique tension generated by the path from loathing to lovers. While accent at times, Anthony and Kate have hilarious, electric, and moving interactions in perfectly measured doses. Where the show made Anthony an obstacle in the early episodes, book Anthony was an exemplary guardian to his sisters and held his responsibilities as head of the family as the most important aspect of his life. It is interesting how the show plans to reconcile this with his roguish and short-sighted behaviour in Season One. Regardless, far more so than with “The Duke and I,” the source material has a lot of potential.
The third book, “An Offer from a Gentleman,” follows second-born Benedict who is perhaps only distinguished as the artsy sibling. The novel is a Cinderella reimagining that breaks the mold by having the love interest be Sophie Beckett, an illegitimate child and servant rather than a fellow member of the upper classes. Benedict meets, and pines for, a beautiful masked woman (Sophie) at a ball. He then meets the beautiful but troublesome servant (also Sophie) whom he cannot love because he is still hoping to find the masked woman again. Full of hijinks and miscommunications, it carries a lovely message about how the messy and imperfect reality of loving someone will always outshine an idealized dream. Unfortunately, this is dampened with more gross misunderstandings about consent as Benedict relentlessly pursues Sophie, despite her asking him to stop as Benedict’s privilege allows him to ignore the danger the disparity between their circumstances presents to Sophie. In the show, Benedict was used to introduce the idea of queerness-or-something (the show doesn’t seem to be sure) but this could be a chance to scrap the whole book in favour of a male love interest for Benedict. There is potential if tweaks are made, but this is not the best of the books despite a promising premise.
The fourth book, “Romancing Mr. Bridgerton,” follows third-born Colin as he realises that if he wants his life to mean something he has to put some effort in, and that as a rich white man, doors are — shockingly — open to him. Love interest Penelope Featherington finally gets the appreciation she deserves as Colin and Penelope’s relationship blossoms from friendship to something more, with many bumps in the road in a way that feels remarkably genuine.
The fifth book, “To Sir Philip, With Love,” follows fifth-born Eloise as she runs off to meet a secret suitor. Claudia Jesse’s version of Eloise is very different from her characterization in the books where she does, in fact, want a husband (quite desperately as the book begins) — she just wants one she can love and respect. The novel includes demonic step children that can only be wrangled with the wisdom that comes from having seven siblings, the poor use of a deceased character’s mental illness as a plot device for angst, and a hilarious incident involving all of the Bridgerton men and a dining table. It’s a perfectly enjoyable book, if a bit trite. Based on the show’s version of Eloise and its drastically different inclusion of Marina Thompson and Philip Crane, some degree of retconning would be needed. Though, since so many changes involving the loudest Bridgerton sister have already been made, it would be lovely to see her fall in love with a woman, or alternatively no one at all, as romantic partnership is not the be all and end all. Regardless of the specific choices made for her, it is clear that Eloise’s character needs more to do than just judge her sister.
The novels about the youngest three siblings are all fun and interesting contributions to the historical romance genre; however, at this point, the sameness in which all of the books are fun and interesting becomes particularly apparent. Sixth-born Francesca’s novel “When He Was Wicked” deals with finding love again after the untimely death of her first husband, deciding what you want your life to be, and seeing love where it wasn’t before. Youngest Hyacinth’s novel, “It’s In His Kiss,” features a mystery, a love interest hated by his father, dubious methods of seduction, and the realisation that you have to try for the things you want. Finally, seventh-born Gregory’s novel, “On The Way To The Wedding,” is the only story to involve more than one love interest and contains seventh-hell levels of drama in a comedy of errors where everyone falls for the wrong person and gets engaged to the wrong person. As a story about being brave and going after what you want, it is truly ridiculously over the top.
Overall, the “Bridgerton” novels are strong examples of their genre. Like the first season of “Bridgerton,” they all have potential. Despite containing varying degrees of entertainment and romance, most of them are worth picking up.

Ahead of dropping a deluxe edition of her latest album, “Positions,” Ariana Grande released the music video for her latest remix collab, “34+35,” featuring Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion.
The video opens with a shot of Grande alone by the side of a pool, swans swimming by in the silence, before the camera pans back and her fellow artists appear. The next few seconds define the rest of the video: opulent but deserted scenery, sultry stares at the camera, and desultory choreography as no one takes themselves too seriously. It’s a vibe and an aesthetic free of any particular narrative, which perfectly fits a song that was supposed to be “ridiculous, so funny and stupid,” as Grande described it on the Zach Sang Show.
Next, the iconic trio hang out in lingerie in an empty hotel, quickly graduating from lounging by the side of a pool to dancing by a luggage cart to reclining on a staircase. All the while, Grande lip syncs the chorus, crooning “Can you stay up all night?” to the camera. While her voice is beautiful throughout, it’s a shame Grande’s portions of this remix are not markedly different from the original and that “34+35” isn’t more vocally demanding. For a singer as talented as Ariana Grande, her shift away from belts and traditional singing in favor of breathy speak-singing is disappointing.
The video continues with a verse from Doja Cat as she raps at the camera while lounging on a sofa in front of two dalmatians, intercut with the three artists dancing in a bathroom. It’s wacky and perfectly compliments the light-hearted nature of the single.
This verse ends abruptly with a cutscene. In the style of Grande’s “Legally Blonde” skit in the middle of her “thank u, next” music video, the song pauses so Grande can order various desserts for herself and her friends over the hotel room intercom. It’s off-kilter and tongue-in-cheek, and while it doesn’t quite manage to be funny, it further supports the video’s whimsical tone.
As Ariana Grande, Meg Thee Stallion, and Doja Cat now hang out in a bedroom, drinking champagne and eating candy, the video begins to feel a bit like a cross between an upper class lifestyle and a girls’ slumber party fantasy filtered through the male gaze. Since the video’s substance is its lack of substance, it struggles to stay engaging when there are only so many ways for twenty-something-year-old artists to make eyes at a camera.
The next verse follows the trio dancing on the bed, spliced with Meg Thee Stallion vibing in an empty bathtub. The lack of choreography given to the artists becomes painfully clear by this point in the video, but Meg Thee Stallion makes up for it with how hard she owns her verse.
The trio return to the bedroom and film each other with a retro camera as the song reaches its iconic ending that reveals just how many people, when presented with a simple sum, will choose not to compute it. As Grande declares in this version, “Math class / Never was good.” The video ends with a meta shot of the three stars of the video watching themselves in videos they supposedly took before a continuation of Grande’s difficulties in attempting to order dessert that screams “look how relatable I am.”
The music video for the “34+35” remix is pretty and mindless, and if you’ve seen any of Grande’s other music videos, you’ve basically already seen this one too. But since it’s for a song about sex that has no other discernable narrative, it works: After all, it’s just a bit of fun.

Not even the pandemic can stop the Opportunes — Harvard’s oldest all-gender a cappella group — from making a splash on the national stage. The tight-knit group of vocalists won first place at the UpStaged National Collegiate Performing Arts A Cappella Championship this January, and have continued to collaborate musically despite being physically apart.
UpStaged AID: One World, Every Student Voice, the largest virtual collegiate a cappella championship, invites groups from around the globe to submit a performance clip for evaluation. This competition cycle, judges received more than 160 applicants from across 11 countries and 5 continents.
President of the Opportunes Carly A. Tiras ’22 who sings soprano and mezzo-soprano said that the application process was surprisingly simple, consisting of a single video submission.
“We got an email about it or found it online somehow,” she said. “That’s all we had to do — this one video was carrying us through the whole competition.”
The Big Three — which consist of the Opportunes’ president, music director, and business manager — were the ones to decide which performance clip would be sent to the competition, according to Tiras. After some deliberation, the three members were between “Hard Place” by H.E.R., featuring and arranged by Devon N. Gates ’23, or “All for Us,” by Labrinth and Zendaya with solo performances from Tiras and Hirsh S. Sisodia ’20.
Tiras had high praise for Gates, whom she described as “incredible.”
“The arrangement — which [Gates] also did — is really, really different than the original song, but it just turned out really amazing.”
Ultimately, “All for Us” stood out because of its ability to tap into the synergistic energy of the team, Tiras said.
“It just feels like such a communal song, and so many people in our group put so much into it,” she said. “It just showcases our talents as arrangers, as choreographers, as singers.”
“We all kind of stand together at the end and sing all together,” Tiras added. “It’s just a super amazing, powerful moment to all be singing the same thing together in a little clump.”
Ben J. Dreier ’22, who is the music director of the Opportunes and sings bass, jokingly mentioned it was “also an amazing and powerful moment” when the group found out that Sisodia had been singing the wrong lyrics for a portion of “All for Us” all along.
“He was mixing up two versions of the song,” Dreier said. “One of which is ‘No food in the kitchen,’ and one of them is ‘Too much in my system.’ Instead he was saying ‘No food in my system,’ which is meaningless,” he said, laughing. “I love Hirsh.”
Tiras said that the competition had allowed representatives from each a cappella group to get on Zoom together and figure out who had qualified for the top 64, and later 32.
“From there, people could watch the videos that were submitted — that were the top 32 at that time — and vote online,” she said. “It was a public audience kind of thing that took us through a bracket.”
Near the end of the tournament, a panel of judges were introduced, who Tiras described as “really cool and impressive,” hailing from renowned musical institutions such as Berklee College of Music.
For the final round announcement, a majority of the members united through Zoom to witness the results together, Dreier said.
“We got a nice gathering of Opportunes,” he said. “Most of the 16 of us showed up just to hang out on the Zoom. And then when they released the video, we all watched it together and had some suspense and then they said our names.”
“We were excited. It was exciting,” Dreier said. “Especially for the last round, the other competitors are in the a cappella world, top of the game. Really, really great groups.”
In second place was Vanderbilt University’s Melodores, a young a cappella group founded in 2009 that has since made headlines by performing for shows including Good Morning America and the Today Show.
“It was intimidating to be up against them, and really cool to come out on top,” Dreier said.
“People were surprised,” Tiras added. “We had a poll in our GroupMe that said ‘What do we think the results are going to be,’ and it was half and half.”
Per competition rules, the $3,000 prize for first place was split between the Opportunes and a charity of their choice. The Harvard vocalists chose the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund (LDF) because of the timeliness and efficacy of the fund’s mission and capacity for change.
“We did some research to try to pick something that was both socially relevant at the time and that we thought would actually be very effective,” Dreier said.
“It’s always a problem historically, with underrepresented minorities not getting the proper legal defense that they need, and that enables a whole cycle of oppression,” he added.
When asked what their favorite aspect of a cappella was, both Tiras and Dreier responded along the same lines: the people.
“It’s such a fun part of college to have this group of people that are just separate from other friends that you make otherwise, and from all different grades, from all different backgrounds, different majors — we all just have this one similarity that really bonds us together,” Tiras said.
Dreier said that despite the “bummer” of having to leave campus and not being able to sing together anymore, the group has been actively experimenting with ways of “still participating and feeling ownership” over diverse musical projects, one of which was a virtual jam performance in the fall.
“We put together a sort of toned-down, chilled-out version of [a jam] where everyone in the Ops got to do a little solo performance,” he said. “We got a huge number of alumni and friends and fans to come on a Zoom call and hang out.”
“It was very fuzzy and warm,” he added.

With his new project “Santa Barbara,” Detroit rapper and longtime Danny Brown associate Fat Ray delivers tremendous hardcore rhymes over classic grimey production, putting himself and the independent Bruiser Brigade Records on the map.
The Bruiser Brigade has existed in some form or another for a decade running, first popping up on the seventh track of group architect Danny Brown’s 2011 project “XXX.” Yet, the label of the same name is just getting off the ground, after launching last January with the release of “GOD GOKU JAY-Z” by signee, rapper-producer J.U.S. The second official Bruiser Brigade release “Santa Barbara,” which is available exclusively on bandcamp and executive produced by Danny Brown, pays homage to the Detroit underground scene that birthed Brown and is evidence that Fat Ray is criminally underrated.
The album features stellar vintage production from Bruiser Brigade affiliates Raphy, Crisfantom, and veteran Detroit beatmaker Black Milk and is reminiscent of early Danny Brown projects. All except for three tracks on the album are produced by Raphy, who channels the versatility and off-kilter groove of Brown’s 2010 debut “The Hybrid.” On the album opener, “Santa Barbara,” Raphy places a crawling trumpet loop over simple boom-bap drums to create a slow-roll groove that flawlessly complements Fat Ray’s punchy flow. On “Top Ramen,” the producer ditches melodic elements, instead using an array of abrasive drum and electric guitar textures similar to the punk-inspired “XXX” era Danny Brown. “Dopeman Heaven,” which features Brown, sees Fat Ray match wits with the spiritual leader of the Bruiser Brigade supported by expert, straightforward beat-making from Black Milk that bolsters the dynamic chemistry between the rappers. Two-part songs excluded, every track on the project is less than three minutes, a concise and perfect length that allows each beat to shine without overstaying its welcome.
Throughout the album, Fat Ray channels a throwback attitude that is both thrilling and nostalgic. On “Menacing,” the rapper shouts out the Wu-Tang Clan in his intro adlibs, paired with sampled dialogue from a vintage Kung Fu movie courtesy of Raphy. Ray’s deliberate flow and unapologetic bravado on the song evokes the mafioso style rap pioneered by Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon. With “The Sword,” produced by Crisfantom, Ray speaks of his love for his hometown and the late Detroit legend and producer J Dilla: “I do this shit for Dilla dog.” Many of the beats on the project from Raphy, especially the two by Crisfandom, take direct inspiration from J Dilla in the use of experimental melodic samples and drum breaks — all of which Fat Ray masterfully rides with clever bars and versatile flows. By directly acknowledging his influences throughout the project, Ray invites comparison and proves that he has the chops to match any of them.
Clocking in at just under half an hour, “Santa Barbara” is short as debut albums go but packs an undeniably hefty punch. From a city primarily known for Big Sean, Eminem, and current it-man Sada Baby, Bruiser Brigade Records is a welcome addition to the Detroit scene that continues the legacy of underground mid-‛90s giants like J Dilla and the experimentation spearheaded by Danny Brown. A decade in the making, Bruiser Brigade Records is just getting started. And Fat Ray is the one to watch.

The transition from childhood to adolescence is a difficult one, filled with inner and interpersonal strife. The uncertain struggle to discover one’s own place and purpose in life constitutes much of this conflict, as depicted in many coming-of-age films. Likewise, “The Life Ahead,” which is now available on Netflix, speaks to the story of a troubled, immigrant boy grappling with his own life trajectory and desire to be accepted in Italian society. However, despite nuanced characters and a well-woven plot, "The Life Ahead" feels like it's missing a dimension of insight into the personality and inner thoughts of its protagonist.
Momo (Ibrahima Gueye) is a young Senegalese immigrant living in a scenic Italian coastal city. Orphaned at a young age, he is left in the care of a local doctor, Dr. Coen (Renato Carpentieri), but is forced to turn to the streets after his guardian can’t devote enough time to raise him. Instead, Momo finds a father figure in a drug dealer who treats him with respect and takes Momo under his wing. Seeing that Momo’s life is heading in the wrong direction, Dr. Coen sets him up to live temporarily with Madame Rosa (Sophia Loren), a Holocaust survivor. Both oppose the arrangement at first but inevitably share several heart-felt moments over the course of the film. Madame Rosa is a strong-willed woman who, like Momo, is reluctant to let people in, and their unlikely blossoming connection speaks to the innate human need for love and acceptance.
The film’s raw surges of sentimentality and moments of loss and personal anguish convey a liveliness that bursts through the screen. This is most powerful in a scene where Madame Rosa and her friend Lola (Abril Zamora) start dancing in a sunlit room. They celebrate amidst intermittent periods of grief and emptiness, illustrating the complex and intimate relationship between joy and hardship.
The unity of emotional experience is one of the film’s most resonant aspects; each of the characters come from different backgrounds and walks of life, yet many of their struggles are one and the same. However, the film fails to give real emotional insight into these struggles, and the audience gets only a glimpse of the characters’ true depths. Momo starts out on a self-destructive pathway as a drug dealer, but suddenly gives up this lifestyle without actual insight into his decision. Any evidence of the reasoning behind this impulsive decision would have given it greater significance in Momo’s character development and the overall trajectory of the story. Although Momo’s feelings can often be perceived without much interior narrative, some of his emotional considerations can only be guessed at best.
Given its ambiguous name, it seems appropriate for “The Life Ahead” to more concretely articulate the meaning of its title to the audience. Nevertheless, “The Life Ahead” is still a breathtaking work of art that can be admired for its emotionality and realistic perspective. Its message of inner peace and unity of feeling can be applied across languages and time frames, especially in our current situation, as we hope for brighter days along the horizon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For almost 20 years, Chris Harrison, longtime host of “The Bachelor” and its gargantuan franchise of reality television spinoffs, has built a career by making broken-hearted people cry in the back of company cars. Now it’s his turn for an unbecoming departure.
Following his racist comments in a Feb. 9 interview on “Extra,” Harrison announced that he will temporarily leave the series, including the remaining episodes in the current season of the franchise’s flagship show — starring Matt James, the first Black Bachelor.
Harrison, who is white, appeared on “Extra” to discuss allegations against Rachael Kirkconnell, a white finalist in James’s ongoing season who has been accused of racism. Among the bevy of alleged offenses are liking Instagram pictures with Confederate iconography, spreading QAnon theories, wearing an appropriative Indigenous costume on Halloween, and bullying a high school classmate for dating Black men. Before these claims gained traction, Kirkconnell was by all accounts a well-liked personality. And with the end-of-season marriage proposal filmed in advance, rumor has it she will go on to win the competition.
Rachel Lindsay, Harrison’s “Extra” interviewer, knows firsthand that the outrage in response to Kirkconnell’s behavior marks the latest in the franchise’s long line of race-based controversies. Lindsay became the first Black Bachelorette in 2017, and one of her most prominent suitors was later revealed to have posted racist Tweets, including one comparing the NAACP to the Ku Klux Klan. More recently, former Bachelorette Hannah Brown apologized after saying the N-word in an Instagram video. And throughout the history of “The Bachelor,” BIPOC contestants have been tokenized, protected by the producers for a few episodes devoid of character development, and then unceremoniously dumped.
But in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, Harrison’s remarks this month pushed the anger among so-called “Bachelor Nation” to a breaking point. Rather than denouncing racism and calling for a statement from Kirkconnell, he admonished “the woke police” for pressing the issue. “Who the hell are you? Who are you that you demand this?” he asked Lindsay, a Black woman who has been a outspoken advocate for her fellow BIPOC contestants in the franchise. He urged her to “have a little grace” and give Kirkconnell a chance to respond. “I respect her enough to allow her the courtesy of time,” he said, even though six weeks had elapsed since the first accusations — and years had passed since the alleged behavior took place.
Many of Harrison’s most incendiary comments surrounded pictures of Kirkconnell attending a sorority party that celebrated the antebellum South. He seemed to imply that because the party was three years ago (though he falsely said it was five), Kirkconnell could not be held responsible for her actions. He also claimed that “50 million people” participated in similar events that year. As the hosts of the “Rosecast” recap podcast pointed out, the total number of enrolled college students in America at the time was less than half that figure. Still, Harrison was adamant that times have changed. “Is it [not] a good look in 2018 or is it not a good look in 2021?” he asked.
“It’s not a good look ever,” Lindsay said. “If I went to that party, what would I represent?”
Almost immediately, Harrison faced fierce backlash for his remarks, prompting a next-day apology on Instagram. “What I now realize I have done is cause harm,” he wrote. “I promise to do better.” But for many fans, it was too little, too late. On Feb. 13, a second statement on Harrison’s account explained he will leave the franchise “for a period of time,” including the live season finale, to educate himself. It is unclear whether he will return.
Continuing news coverage — not just from entertainment and gossip publications but from major news outlets like The New York Times and National Public Radio — is cementing the story’s status as a major scandal, and the fallout is far from over. Fans still have many questions about the show’s policies. Why wasn’t Kirkconnell thoroughly vetted, for instance? After the “Extra” interview, Lindsay took to her “Higher Learning” podcast to announce her likely departure from the franchise when her contract expires. Contestants from the current “Bachelor” season — the most diverse yet — and the most recent “Bachelorette” season posted joint statements supporting her. Kirkconnell published her own Instagram apology on Feb. 11, but with just three contestants remaining, James may propose to her on television in a few short weeks. Bachelor Nation is divided. Prominent comments on Harrison’s statement are split between support for the decision and support for the former host. “Cancel Rachel Lindsay,” one commenter wrote. “I refuse to watch the bachelor without you.”
Perhaps surprisingly, “The Bachelor” has been one of the most unifying cultural forces in the country until now. Amid an intensely polarized media landscape, the franchise has managed to weather every storm with a robust fan base largely intact. Its strategies for appeasing as many constituencies as possible — for example, casting James, who was a registered Republican until 2020, as its first Black male lead — have secured its consistent top spots in ratings. But Harrison may be the first casualty in a firestorm that brings down the once-incombustible franchise.
Only time will tell if the series earns a rose or ends this episode sobbing in the backseat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mom always emphasized the importance of education outside of the classroom when my sisters and I were younger. One of her avenues for accomplishing this was through informative placemats at our kitchen table. While the adults would eat on traditional placemats, we were assigned ones with maps of the United States to learn geography, phonics to improve our reading and pronunciation, clocks to learn time telling, and a list of “Great African Americans” to learn our history.
The Great African Americans placemat contained short biographies and images of 45 Black history icons spanning over 200 years of American history. Without this placemat, I may have never learned about Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, Mary McLeod Bethune, or Carter Godwin Woodson.
Unfortunately, not every child has a Great African Americans placemat to read when they’re bored at the dinner table. Instead, they rely primarily on their schools to teach them about Black historical figures. Right now, these schools are generally failing. According to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center on civil rights education in schools, 20 states were assigned an “F” for their instruction of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and only three were assigned an “A.” Students across the country are lacking in their knowledge of one of the most important rights movements in U.S. history.
When I was between the ages of eight and 13, every February my uncle would host a Black History Month program. He would rent out an auditorium on a Sunday afternoon and invite our relatives and local community members to watch Black youth pay tribute to Black icons, artists, and revolutionaries from before our time. It was an opportunity for us to practice public speaking and remind us who paved the way for so many in our community to achieve.
Every year at the program, the size of the crowd would grow while the list of names discussed stayed the same. The biographies of Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and the like were recycled each year. I noticed the same pattern at school. Ten years after my first Black History Month program, the set of Black History Month names remain unchanged while Black history itself progresses every day. It begs the question: What is the relevance of Black History Month if our knowledge of Black history isn’t evolving year to year?
Black History Month is no stranger to evolving its practices, however. In 1926, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, today the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, organized a Black History week in February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass — two integral figures in the advancement of Black people in the United States. The commemorative week was celebrated across the country. Following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Black History Week expanded in importance and length. In 1976, ASALH officially changed Black History Week to Black History Month, as we celebrate it today.
In the wake of 2020’s racial awakening, Black History Month in 2021 presents the perfect opportunity to update how we celebrate the Black past. Instead of confining general knowledge of Black history to a list of ten names, February can be used to honor those tackling the issues that plague the Black community today. I don’t suggest that we discard the history entirely; instead, I propose a more dynamic list that elevates figures that rose to prominence past the year 2000. Names like Tarana Burke, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Ava DuVernay, each a Black activist in their own right, should enter Black History Month discourse in years to come.
Educational institutions must place more emphasis on Black history, and not just as an afterthought when February rolls around each year. Modernizing Black history lessons can make them more engaging for students, and potentially correct recent failures of our education system. K-12 and higher education institutions have a responsibility to show students why Black history should matter to them. In an America where Black voices are so often marginalized, any opportunity to uplift them should be immediately seized. Black history is American history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Are all corporations evil? If you’re a member of Harvard’s environmental and social advocacy circles, the answer is most likely an unequivocal “yes.”
I used to agree. Now, I’m not so sure.
I became interested in environmental advocacy after watching Food, Inc. in high school, a documentary describing how mega agriculture companies like Monsanto (now Bayer) corrupted the U.S. food industry. My distrust of corporations solidified as I exhausted media like Merchants of Doubt and Dirty Money — books and documentaries describing egregious examples of corporate greed.
This view was only reinforced by the people I surrounded myself with at Harvard. “Bring down the Capitalist Patriarchy!” my Social(ism) Studies peers cheer. Environmental advocates agreed, brandishing their tofurky sausages.
In an effort to learn more about keeping evil corporations accountable, I enrolled in Professor Jane Nelson’s class on International and Global Affairs 165M: “Corporate Responsibility and New Governance Models”. Instead of a lesson in how to body slam ExxonMobil, I was forced to reconsider my overgeneralized views on corporate activity: This is my plea for my fellow granola advocates to do the same.
Over the past several decades, corporations have increasingly published Corporate Responsibility reports outlining their sustainability initiatives. Corporate Responsibility (CR) is a “management practice whereby companies integrate social, environmental, and economic concerns into their business operations.” In 1999, 35 percent of G250 companies published sustainability reports. Now, 80 percent of companies worldwide report on sustainability, 40 percent acknowledge the financial risks of climate change to business operations, and a majority have plans to reduce CO2 emissions.
Following the horrific murder of George Floyd, businesses pursued various strategies to combat systemic racism in America and within their own operations. Many donated to racial justice organizations, made Juneteenth a holiday, and pledged to increase office inclusivity. Amazon and IBM placed moratoriums on racial recognition technology due to potential human rights violations. Esteé Lauder Companies and Facebook pledged to employ more Black and Latinx workers and Black-owned suppliers.
When Covid-19 struck, corporations everywhere utilized a variety of tools such as philanthropy, core business activities, and partnerships to fight the virus. Amazon’s $4 billion Covid-related initiatives focused on employee health and supporting hard-hit communities by donating money, PPE, and other equipment.
Self-interest is undoubtedly driving corporate participation in such initiatives. CR initiatives can improve a company’s image, increase brand recognition, and build community dependence on temporary services. Sustainability reporting can also serve as a cover up for significant irresponsible actions — in mid-February, New York’s Attorney General sued Amazon over its alleged failure to protect more than 5,000 employees in two facilities from exposure to Covid-19.
Despite the blatant gap between sincere motive and outcome in these initiatives, CR has contributed billions of dollars globally towards social and environmental causes and put pressure on complicit peer corporations to improve unscrupulous practices, helping facilitate broader cultural shifts. The potential for good here should not be ignored.
The anti-capitalist in me was initially perplexed by this information. How can it be that some corporations are at once self-interested and philanthropic: the modern-day perpetrators of grave social ails and some of the leading champions of social responsibility?
Consumers and evolving market forces are incentivizing corporations to act consciously, as well as irresponsibly. From this, we can glean that not all corporations can be subjected to a rigid good-bad binary.
As the father and skeptic of unregulated capitalism Adam Smith, once wrote: “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity, but to their self-love.”
Using this corporate self-interest as a lever, consumers, employees, and investors are demanding more than just products and services. Many employees and consumers, especially those with the financial privilege to choose, will select careers and products based on a corporation’s initiatives. Sustainable investments globally more than doubled from $13.3 trillion in 2012 to $30.7 trillion in 2018.
Additionally, taking action to mitigate natural disasters, pandemics, and humanitarian crises helps businesses manage risk. The rate of such crises has accelerated over past decades and is projected to continue due to climate change, urbanization, globalization, and other transformations.
Despite these powerful forces, corporate greed — a cultural fetishization of profit — is inextricable from the corporation. So too is the profit-motivated corporation woven into the fabric of America’s capitalist spirit and cultural desires. Capitalism’s drive for endless growth puts pressure on corporations to meet consumers’ endless demand for cheap beef, plastic products, energy, and clothing regardless of the negative externalities. Dehumanization, corruption, and glossy CR reports are its products.
I’m a pragmatist. While I want to uproot the Capitalist Patriarchy as much as the next granola advocate, I do not see an alternate economic system being instated fast enough to solve the dire problems capitalism has created. CR, however, can be a solution if we nurture it effectively.
Yes, corporate incentives are flawed, but many have conformed to demands for social responsibility and have made tangible steps in the right direction. More will do the same if advocates condemn the plethora of bad while celebrating the significant good. Doing so may even open up opportunities for us — as advocates, consumers, future workers, and dare I say, investors — to collaborate with willing corporations.
Ultimately, wielding corporate self-interest wisely will serve our own interest in making the world a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard loves Harvard — that much seems sure (and, hey, sometimes we do too!). But does Harvard love education more broadly? There is mounting reason not to be so certain.
Since its 2011 inception, the course General Education 1076: “Equity and Excellence in K-12 American Schools” has been elevated to the status of a beloved and transformative “must-take” amongst students at the College. The course, taught by lecturer Katherine K. Merseth, has managed to attract students across concentrations and backgrounds with its commitment to dismantling students’ traditionally “myopic view” of the educational system. Yet on Jan. 14, after almost a decade of continued success, Gen Ed 1076 was abruptly canceled for the 2021 academic year and placed on a two-year rotation due to budget constraints.
The harm that will stem from limiting the availability of Gen Ed 1076 runs deep. Typically, the course draws in 400 to 600 interested students each year; among these eager students, only a fortunate 160 of them emerge as enrollees following the competitive course lottery. Now, that small fraction of lucky enrollees has been halved, leaving an unnecessarily large number of students deprived of the unparalleled opportunity to deeply engage the strengths and glaring inequities in the American schooling system from an academic perspective. Given that Harvard undergrads tend to lean wealthy (and may consequently have blind spots on these issues), removing this opportunity to probe the socioeconomic disparities plaguing public education is disastrous. This is particularly unnerving given the stigma the small sect of Harvard students hoping to pursue careers in education say they experience because of their intended career path. Gen Ed 1076 — with its far-reaching nature and broad appeal — played a large role in combating that stigma. Now, that potential is fairy dust.
Beyond that, Gen Ed 1076’s cancellation seems to implicitly advance the notion that the University grants preferential treatment to some fields of study over others. Gen Ed 1076 is a particularly meaningful course for those students pursuing Educational Studies, a nascent secondary field made official two years ago, who describe the class as a “gateway” into the program. Inevitably, the strength of the Education secondary field will be severely diminished through its loss of this foundational course. Yet as the Education secondary threatens to wane, many Harvard students continue to be funneled into a narrow, select number of concentrations — Economics, Computer Science, and Government, to name a few. By further limiting an already-overlooked field, the College has actively chosen to maintain the status quo; to champion some disciplines over others while educating on issues of education inequity — which we, as students of the world’s most elite university, would do well to have an awareness of — is earmarked as dispensable.
The discontinuation of Merseth’s class also comes during a global moment in which the future of education is more uncertain (and opportune for transformation) than ever.
While the U.S education system has long been marked by inequality along racial and socioeconomic lines, the Covid-19 pandemic has inflamed these disparities. This unprecedented moment has ultimately drawn much-needed attention and interest in studying education and working to enhance equity, innovation, and care within the classroom. After years of grappling with educational issues in the lecture hall, there is no doubt that Merseth’s digital classroom would have been the ideal place to pursue such inquiries. Now, the absence of such a space has placed undue boundaries upon students’ ability to engage with the challenges of this all-encompassing period; in doing so, it has severely undercut the gravity of the moment.
Gen Ed 1076’s former students are not taking the course’s cancellation sitting down. Only one day after learning of its cancellation, three prior enrollees and teaching fellows of the course forged a petition urging the Harvard administration to reverse their decision — and, before long, nearly 1,000 students, faculty, and alumni joined their ranks. These collective efforts are an inspiring example of dismay being turned into urgent, uplifting action.
The strength and scope of this communal discontent also highlight the disjointedness between students’ wishes and the University’s demands. Too often, administrative decisions about curricula lack transparency and fail to involve constructive, much-needed coordination with students.
The opportunity to make positive and productive changes to course offerings — to, as a student, have a stake in the trajectory of our own education — is a necessary learning experience in and of itself. It’s an exercise in making our voices heard, and in fighting for the education we know we need. The University would do well to listen.
It is jarring that a course so fiercely beloved by students is being slashed. This dynamic cannot continue to prevail. When it comes to making critical choices about course offerings, students deserve a seat at the table.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Cambridge woman in her 20s became the first person in Massachusetts to test positive for the Covid-19 variant originally detected in South Africa, the city’s public health department announced last Thursday.
The woman tested positive for the variant — officially designated the B.1.351 variant — in January and isolated after the positive test, according to the health department statement. There are no known contacts or travel history related to the case. A second Massachusetts case of the variant from South Africa was detected on Feb. 19.
Detection of the variant takes several weeks to process after a result comes back as positive. The variant was confirmed with genetic sequencing by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, according to a release from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The Broad Institute also processes Covid-19 tests for Harvard affiliates, which detects the presence of known Covid-19 variants.
“Detection of the B.1.351 COVID-19 variant is testament to the strength of our communicable disease surveillance system in the Commonwealth,” Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude A. Jacob said in a press release. “It is also a reminder that this pandemic is far from over, and we all must continue to wear masks, social distance, and get vaccinated when it is our turn.”
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance states the variant from South Africa spreads more easily than the original strain, as does the variant from the U.K. In its last update on Feb. 17, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed 44 cases of the variant from the U.K. in the state. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of the variant from Brazil.
Since Covid-19 tests target specific viral genes, mutations in the virus may bypass tests targeting only one genetic location. In late January, Broad Institute upgraded its testing, adding a second genetic target to its tests, helping Broad identify unknown Covid-19 variants, according to Broad Institute spokesperson Karen Zusi.
“One of several advantages of adding a second genetic target to the test is to help guard against new, unknown variants of the virus that could affect the performance of the assay, as well as increasing the sensitivity of the test,” Zusi wrote in an emailed statement.
Zusi added the Broad Institute has not adjusted its PCR cycle threshold for tests, meaning that tests still return a negative test result after viral RNA is not detected during the process.
While the PCR test administered to students at the College cannot identify which specific variant a person is carrying, the test detects the presence of known variants, Zusi wrote. Still, an “inconclusive” result should not be interpreted as a signal towards a positive or a negative result.
In an emailed statement, Harvard University Health Services spokesperson Michael Perry wrote that HUHS was keeping close track of variant-related news and urged Harvard affiliates on campus to continue safe practices.
“HUHS, like every other health care organization, continues to closely monitor the status of the pandemic, including information regarding variants of the virus,” Perry wrote. “The presence of variants in the broader community underscores the critical importance of continued masking, distancing and handwashing, and other relevant practices and protocols that have helped us limit the transmission of COVID-19 on campus.”

Amid Cambridge’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign and phased reopening, city officials urged the public to remain vigilant against the spread of virus variants during a Monday City Council meeting.
On Feb. 18, Massachusetts progressed to Phase Two of its vaccination program, which extends coverage to individuals over the age of 65, residents and staff of low and affordable income senior housing, and individuals with two or more comorbidities. Teachers, service workers, and individuals with one underlying medical condition also fall under “Phase 2,” but are not yet eligible to receive the vaccine.
The general population will have access to the vaccine under “Phase 3,” which is set to begin in April, per the Massachusetts Department of Health.
As Cambridge residents receive the vaccination, cases of Covid-19 in the city are continuing to drop, according to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale. The case positivity rate in the city decreased from roughly 1 percent on Feb. 8 to just over half a percent as of Feb. 18.
Despite the auspicious data, DePasquale urged residents to continue practicing health protocols to mitigate transmission.
“I want to strongly encourage the public to continue to adhere to our public health guidance and please don't let your guard down,” DePasquale said. “I also want to thank our local businesses for following sector specific safety protocols and placing and adhering to capacity restrictions.”
DePasquale noted during the meeting that Cambridge still lacks a public vaccination site due to a statewide shortage of doses. The state retracted support for individual municipal vaccine clinics, which includes Cambridge, in a notification to local boards of health on Feb. 17. Effective March 1, the state will stop providing dose one vaccines to local municipalities unless they can vaccinate 750 individuals per week, a number which Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob said the city can accommodate.
“We are capable of administering this volume based on our experience at the CambridgeSide Mall and other on site vaccination efforts,” Jacob said at Monday’s meeting. “We are actively discussing with regional partners to ensure access to vaccines and the coverage of our respective communities and our higher risk populations.”
Since Jan. 4, Massachusetts vaccinators have administered 1,209,614 doses with 225,341 utilized in the last seven days.
Cambridge continues to test for Covid-19 variants among its population. The first case of the B1.351 variant — a variant that originated in South Africa and is more contagious — reported in the state was in Cambridge, the Cambridge Department of Public Health announced last week. Jacob also announced at Monday’s meeting the city had detected another case of the B1.351 variant.
As of Feb. 21, 34 cases of the B1.1.7 variant, which originated in the United Kingdom, were reported in the state, in addition to the two cases of the B1.351 variant in Cambridge.
Jacob cautioned that testing numbers might underrepresent the number of variant cases in the city and said residents should continue to adhere to public health guidelines.
During the meeting, Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he is concerned the city’s messaging about remaining vigilant against the virus conflicts with its phased reopening.
“We’re going to have very little influence on how and when our residents get vaccinated at this point,” Zondervan said. “Then we’re being told it’s okay to go out and dine indoors at restaurants even at higher capacity than before, so that’s a real contradiction to me.”
In response, DePasquale cited that Covid-19 cases are down in the city and Cambridge’s effective and individualized response to the public health crisis.
“No city, except for maybe Somerville in some cases, has had more delays or adjustments to the Governor’s recommendation than the City of Cambridge,” DePasquale said. “It’s something we’re very proud of, and it’s something we’ve worked on.”
“Based on where we are now, we feel we are in a good place,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the twenty-first consecutive year, Harvard University has been named the largest employer in the City of Cambridge.
The Cambridge Community Development Department — the city’s planning agency — releases a report detailing the 25 largest providers of jobs in the city each year. Harvard has been the top employer since 1986, except the three years when MIT clinched first place instead.
In 2020, Harvard employed 12,858 “full time equivalents,” which the CDD defines as an employee working 35-40 hours per week.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that Harvard strives to complement Cambridge’s mission to be a “thriving place in which to live, learn, work and play.”
“The university is proud of its partnerships and shared commitments in our host communities, including efforts that advance educational opportunities, support economic development, and address a range of community needs in Cambridge,” she wrote.
There are over 57,000 FTE positions spread across Cambridge’s top 25 employers — nearly 43 percent of the city’s workforce.
MIT and Takeda Pharmaceuticals provided the second and third highest number of jobs, respectively. MIT employed 9,322 FTEs, while Takeda Pharmaceuticals employed 3,484.
Though Harvard and MIT appear regularly on the top 25 employers, the CDD notes that the list has boasted 66 different employers beyond these “regulars” throughout the years.
Ten of the 25 employers are involved in the biotechnology cluster — a high density of biotechnology companies in a small area. Industry giants such as Pfizer, Novartis, Biogen and Sanofi are among those that have locations in Cambridge, and Kendall Square has even been dubbed by some the “most innovative square mile on the planet.” Biotech industry leaders attribute this to the City of Cambridge’s decision in the 1970s to regulate DNA experimentation, thereby creating business opportunities for the nascent biotech industry.
Despite Harvard’s title as largest employer in the city, the pandemic also forced Harvard to permanently close four University Dining Services facilities in January, resulting in 20 layoffs. Harvard also announced a salary and hiring freeze in April 2020, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences furloughed a number of workers in June 2020.
Still, the University had 293 more full time equivalents in 2020 than in 2019.

Harvard spent $555,000 on federal lobbying in 2020, outpacing all other Ivy League schools for the fourth time in the last five years.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and representatives from the University’s Office of Federal Relations lobbied the White House and Congress on issues tied to student financial aid, research funding, and taxes on Harvard’s $41.9 billion endowment. Last year also brought legislation related to the coronavirus pandemic and immigration to the forefront of the University’s lobbying activities.
“There has also been extensive outreach this year on the challenges surrounding the pandemic and the impact on the University and its students as well as the engagement of the faculty directly on COVID-19, on testing, treatments, vaccines, and health disparities,” University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email.
Harvard’s spending decreased $40,000 from 2019, according to federal disclosures, marking the third straight year lobbying costs have fallen for the University. The drop over the past year — eight times larger than the 2019 change — marks the most significant decrease in lobbying expenditures since 2011.
The Harvard School of Public Health also hired Center Road Solutions, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm, to advocate for initiatives relating to eating disorder awareness on behalf of the Strategic Training for the Prevention of Eating Disorders program. The School of Public Health’s lobbying expenses totaled $40,000.
Harvard’s efforts brought several successes, including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act in March 2020. The $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package provided direct assistance to American individuals and small businesses and allocated nearly $14 billion to supporting institutions of higher education.
Though the package initially granted Harvard nearly $9 million dollars, the University announced it would not “seek or accept” any CARES Act funding following backlash from members of Congress and former President Donald J. Trump.
In addition to the spat over CARES funding, the University publicly clashed with the Trump administration over immigration issues on numerous occasions. Harvard sued federal authorities last July over a policy that would have barred international students taking classes online from staying in the United States.
“Immigration and the issues faced by international students have been a particular focus in concert with the work of our peers, associations and the strong support of the Massachusetts delegation,” Newton wrote.
In a speech last Friday at the New England Business Immigration Summit, Bacow called on Congress to pass an immigration overhaul that provides “the broadest possible relief” for undocumented individuals.
“After an unprecedented period of hostility towards immigrants, towards refugees, we’re at a critical turning point,” he said. “We need Congress to pass legislation to put the undocumeted on a path to citizenship and to win back international students and scholars to avoid lasting damage to our national competitiveness, security, and prosperity.”
Across the Ivy League, legislation related to the pandemic and immigration remained high priorities. Nevertheless, all Ivy League universities for which data was available saw their spending drop from 2019. 
 
Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth have consistently spent the least on lobbying activities among Ivy League schools. Dartmouth’s expenditures have not met the minimum threshold for disclosure in recent years, according to Heather Drinan, the school’s institutional contact for the federal government.
For most Ivy League universities, 2020 lobbying expenditures reached their peak between January and March before declining through the rest of the year.
Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education, said this trend may represent the limitations on in-person lobbying activities due to the pandemic.
“A lot of this was about person-to-person contact and advocacy with legislative officials, staff, and members, and that got real hard after the first quarter of the year,” Hartle said.
Harvard’s lobbying expenditures remained roughly steady over the past 10 years following a steep five-year drop between 2007 and 2011, a period during which the Democrats controlled the U.S. House and Senate.
“Harvard’s big focus is going to be on scientific research,” Hartle said. “Democrats have recently been much more willing to invest in scientific research than Republicans have.”
The University’s lobbying spending peaked in 2007 when Congress considered reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, which provided financial aid funding for students. Though the act was not reauthorized in 2013, Hartle said he hoped before the pandemic that Congress would address it in 2020.
“Last year, in the Senate, we had two really good senators in key positions to get that done, Lamar Alexander from Tennessee and Patty Murray from Washington,” Hartle said. “So there were hopes that Congress would get around to finally rewriting the Higher Education Act, but that simply didn’t happen.”
Hartle said that pandemic and economic recovery are going to be “job one for Congress” in 2021. He added, however, that he expects higher education lobbying activities and the White House’s priorities to center around reversing Trump-era policies, such as visa restrictions for international students and Title IX guidelines.
“There is just a whole raft of things where the Trump administration was moving in directions that were of great concern to many colleges and universities,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III said in a Thursday interview with The Crimson that the School has made “great progress” in implementing its “robust” diversity plan.
SEAS is in the second year of its five-year Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Strategic Plan — spearheaded by Alexis J. Stokes, SEAS assistant dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging — to ramp up efforts of diversity and inclusion across the division, according to Doyle.
The five-year plan has five priority areas: recruitment and access, community engagement, retention and success, assessment and tracking, and external outreach.
One element in the plan is a diversity dashboard — which the school released in early February with data from fall 2020 — that outlines the most updated breakdowns on gender, race and ethnicity, and retention among undergraduates, graduates, faculty, researchers, and staff.
While the breakdown between male and female undergraduate students was 66 to 34 percent, respectively, in the School’s 2017-18 diversity report, the dashboard reports a current breakdown at 59 to 41 percent, respectively.
Among Ph.D. students, the change is smaller, from 69 percent male and 31 percent female in 2017-18 to 66 percent versus 34 percent as of fall 2020.
For ladder faculty — faculty with tenure or on the tenure-track — the current disparity is much greater, currently sitting at 81 percent male and just 19 percent female, as compared to 82 percent and 18 percent in 2017-18.
Though the plan — outlined in a 37-page document released in 2019 — has concrete steps outlined under its goals, Doyle said the plan is continually reexamined and improved.
“A big part of what we learned in our climate survey is that transparency is important,” Doyle said, referring to a 2018 survey that found women and minorities reported higher rates of discrimination at SEAS. “We didn’t create a five year plan and [say], ‘Okay, hit the goal button and just execute’ — we come back and review and reassess.”
Doyle noted that the Black Lives Matter protests of the summer also led SEAS to reassess the structure of its plan to promote awareness of racial justice.
“The events of the summer really made us look deeply at the plan and whether we should have prioritized things that might have been in the outyear,” Doyle said.
Outside of bolstering racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, the SEAS Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging has also focused on providing equal opportunity for students from more disadvantaged financial situations.
SEAS’s graduate programs originally told graduate admissions candidates that sending GRE scores was optional. The GRE is a graduate school entrance exam usually mandated by many Harvard graduate programs. Doyle said, since many students still fretted over their scores, the requirement created a “financial barrier.” He added that, since the GRE was also not a helpful metric for its admissions process, SEAS will not request any exam results moving forward.
“The GRE is not a reliable indicator of the success of a degree candidate,” Doyle said. “It does a much better job of screening certain demographics, which is the opposite of what you want to do.”
In the past admissions cycle, SEAS Ph.D. programs saw a 34 percent increase in applications from underrepresented minorities.
Many graduate programs across Harvard have seen reductions as a result of the pandemic downscaling, but Doyle said one of SEAS’s priorities amid the pandemic is to maintain and increase diversity in admissions.
“While we might be more attentive to making sure we got the right-sized cohort to support, we want that to be a diverse cohort,” he said.
Research opportunities were another concern for some students, according to Doyle, who noted students often have to network based on connections or email faculty members out of the blue, which he believes “shouldn’t be the entry point.”
Finding and joining labs as an undergraduate researcher through such networking connections is "an insider’s approach" and "not an equitable process,” Doyle said. In response, he noted that SEAS has held open houses showcasing lab groups and their projects, which students can join.
“All students who might have an interest would find a comfortable, convenient gateway to come in,” Doyle said of the open houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union met with University administrators last Tuesday to discuss concerns over health and safety, including access to mental health and specialist care, Covid-19 contact tracing, and protections for student workers working remotely.
Per Article 10 of its contract, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and the University meet to discuss health and safety at least twice each contract year. Wednesday’s meeting between HGSU-UAW and Harvard representatives from the Office of Labor and Employee Relations, Harvard University Health Services, and Environmental Health and Safety occurred just days after the union filed an intent to bargain for its second contract.
“It was very obvious to us that health and safety was a key concern for people, and we couldn’t wait till the contract fight to start bringing some demands up to the University,” HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said. “I think it was a time for them to sit with us and meet us and actually hear directly from us.”
According to Mancilla, the union began scheduling the health and safety meeting in December and surveying members in preparation. From those survey results, the union presented four central topics for discussion: mental health, specialist care, Covid-19 contact tracing, and protections for student workers while they are working remotely.
HGSU-UAW Grievance Officer Andrew N. “Drew” Dates said many union members reported long wait times for initial mental health screening appointments in the last year. Students living outside of Cambridge are also uncertain about how to access mental health care through Harvard, he said.
“The goal is really to make sure that all members of the community at Harvard are unified in their expectations, needs, and goals for University-provided mental health care,” Dates said. “We see this as a step forward, working together with the University, but also to make sure that things like this don’t happen again.”
According to Dates, the union and the University have discussed a potential “mental health bill of rights,” which Mancilla said is inspired by the Vanderbilt University’s Mental Health Bill of Rights for its graduate students.
The union also brought up concerns over the lack of access to specialist care during the pandemic, according to Dates. He cited diabetic students and others seeing endocrinologists experiencing delays as appointments transitioned to telemedicine.
Dates said HGSU-UAW has requested that the HUHS website reflect recent changes to the services it provides, especially for students not living in Massachusetts.
Besides health care services, Mancilla said the union is also concerned about the University’s contract tracing program.
“They’re following the state policy on informing the person who got tested positive and those who had close contact with them, but beyond that they were not doing anything,” Mancilla said. “One of our issues with that is that’s not how Covid works.”
Harvard, Dates said, has no mandate in place to tell graduate students if anyone in their building or on their floor at work tests positive for Covid because those distances do not constitute “close contact” — being within 6 feet of someone for at least 15 minutes — as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“If you’re working 6 feet apart all day, that is longer than 15 minutes,” Dates said, specifically pointing to union members who work in labs. “That is a close contact. This is something that the University has really not controlled.”
Although Mancilla acknowledged privacy concerns stemming from more rigorous contact tracing, he said students are taking risks when they go to work in-person and should have more information.
For graduate student workers operating partially or fully from home, HGSU-UAW is also calling for the University to make the home a workplace to expand student workers’ access to necessary resources and injury-related compensation, according to Dates.
“The most important thing that we find critical right now to the success of every single student worker is that the home is officially considered by the University as a workplace,” he said. “We have won many rights about what student workers are owed by the University in their workplaces.”
Article 15 of the contract says the University will provide HGSU-UAW members with the materials necessary to complete their jobs. Article 10, concerning health and safety, allows HGSU-UAW members to file for workers’ compensation if they are injured at work. Defining the home as a workplace would give members access to both of these provisions as they work from home, Dates said, offering examples such as adequate internet access and compensation for spinal issues from non-ergonomic work stations.
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, Harvard is reviewing a summary of the information provided by the union and will take the concerns into consideration.
Now that the union has begun an official conversation with the University over its concerns and demands, Mancilla said next steps are drafting policy proposals ahead of a second meeting union officials anticipate later this spring.
“We’re encouraged at the end of this meeting that the rigorous and thorough feedback we’ve now given Harvard will be taken into account moving forward and that a lot of these issues can and will be solved if we can work together on this,” Dates said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
D. Anthony Alvarez ’21, a member of the Harvard Latter-day Saints Student Association, has attended religious services at the same congregation off campus since he arrived at Harvard as a freshman.
This semester, Alvarez said he still attends services at that same congregation. Amid Covid-19, though, he must sign up to attend ahead of time, don a mask, and eschew singing, which can spread infectious particles.
As the College approaches the first anniversary of sending students home due to the pandemic, students said they have adopted new ways to practice their faith in the Covid-19 era, including attending reduced-capacity services, convening for religious conversations over Zoom, and seeking support from Harvard chaplains.
Without a physical space to practice her faith, Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 said she finds solace in Zoom meetings with the Sikhs and Companions of Harvard.
Ahuja said she appreciates how the virtual space has provided her spiritual and personal relationships.
“Practicing faith in a pandemic is obviously really, really difficult because you can’t practice in person like you used to,” Ahuja said. “There are frankly so few Sikhs at Harvard, so finding that community was definitely difficult over the first semester.”
“Having that footing has really meant the world,” she added.
Matthew M. Jelen ’21, a member of Harvard Hillel, said the organization has adjusted most of its social programming to an online format. For ritual and prayer, members have turned to their local congregations.
“What’s really missing is the more religiously oriented programming,” Jelen said. “Students have been forced to turn to their home communities — especially students who are living off campus — to basically get the religious programming that they would normally find at Hillel.”
Bracha Rosenberg ’21, another Hillel participant, said online services — which have become popular during the pandemic — can be restrictive to people who closely observe Shabbat, including herself.
“On Shabbat a lot of Orthodox students don’t use electronics, so we can’t do any kind of Zoom programming on Shabbat, we can’t do any services,” Rosenberg said.
The pandemic has also created difficulties for Muslim students who partake in Ramadan — a month-long holiday that practitioners observe through fasting and prayer — which begins April 12.
Before the pandemic, Harvard Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid said he hosted nightly Ramadan dinners for students to break fast together and have access to halal dining.
“[Harvard University Dining Services] had not really offered halal dining in the past, other than just halal chicken occasionally,” he said. “Because of the Covid situation, the really good thing that has come about is that HUDS is reforming how they’re doing dining, particularly for Muslim students.”
Aisha C. Abdelhamid ’23, co-president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said the group successfully advocated for HUDS to expand its dining options to include halal food this semester.
Abdur-Rashid said he hopes Muslim students living on campus will be able to come together to observe the holiday.
“Maybe something can be done at the College where students can break fast together, even in groups of two,” he said. “In some way that is acceptable so that some sense of community can be retained.”
Reem K. Ali ’23, Harvard Islamic Society’s other co-president, said her group has carried out programming including discussion groups, “big sib, little sib” pairings, and speaker events during the pandemic.
Christian student groups have also attempted to strengthen connections among students online.
Harvard College Faith and Action maintained weekly programming on Zoom for discipleship and fellowship groups, per member Festus O. Ojo ’21.
Ojo said he and other students have tried to replicate the “intimate interaction” provided by in-person group events.
“We still try to simulate the same thing over Zoom, so definitely grateful for that space because it has been a hard time,” he said.
John E. “Jack” Markert ’23, a member of the Harvard Baha’i Association, said he has found it difficult to build connections through online programming. Still, he said the organization has seen sizable turnout at its virtual events.
In addition to replicating its in-person programming virtually, Harvard Dharma, a Hindu student association, has created unique events tailored to the remote setting, per the group’s co-president Pranati P. Parikh ’21.
“Rather than doing really, really big Zoom calls once in a while, we’re trying to do smaller things more regularly and let people know that we’re here in spirit,” Parikh said. “We’re here to support them.”
On one Zoom call, for example, club members shared with one another how they practice Hindu rituals in their households.
Harvard Buddhist Chaplain Lama Migmar Tseten said he has found Zoom conducive to holding meditation retreats.
“The very meaning of the retreat is retreating from all the distractions in the outside world,” he said. “I think it’s working very well.”
Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein said he has made it a habit to check in on his students directly.
“We should all have opportunities to talk about what we’re feeling good about, what we’re feeling terrible about, and what we’re feeling uncertain about,” he said. “That’s not a program, it’s not a special guest speaker, but it’s what we need.”
Chana “Adelle” Goldenberg ’21, co-president of the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics, said she turned to the organization to cope at the start of the pandemic.
“I returned again to the basic questions that led me to a spiritual organization, which is, ‘What’s the meaning of life and how do we make the most of it?’” Goldenberg said.

Every Valentine’s Day, the Harvard masses wake up to the most highly anticipated email of the year: “Your matches are ready.” The suspense crushes us as we open our account to find what the Supreme Cupids have made of our scientific survey choices. Then we see our matches… and for the *unfortunate* (read: me and you) the list of matches crushes us too. See if your worst Datamatches can top these five!
That match who helped you find your phone when you lost it at Visitas
Small details. They probably don’t remember. But I do. I remember Visitas. I remember that awkward breakout room. In addition to all our mutual friends and overlapping affinity spaces. I can’t get away. When I signed up for MIT’s Aphrodite, I didn’t plan on getting matched with someone at Harvard — especially not someone I already knew. Lesson learned: don’t cheat on Datamatch.
That match that’s your best friend’s blockmate
Maybe this one shouldn’t be so bad. But knowing the inner workings of their blocking group dynamic feels like you’ve breached boundaries. You know them. You’ve hung out with them. You know you don’t vibe, but Datamatch thinks you do. Apparently your similar taste in One Direction boys was enough for them to be on the list, but not high enough for a free meal. Tough.
That freshman who is ~persistent~
For upperclassmen, this one is self-explanatory. For all the 2024’s let me spell it out: Open your match. Read the class year. If it’s not 2024, forget it. You’re barely (or not even) 18. If you matched with an upperclassman, don’t stalk our insta and try to slide into the DM’s (dude, if you’re reading this, please stop). For your own sake, the best answer an upperclassman can give you is “pass 😪” and the worst is “yes 😳".
That match that’s your friend’s ex
Do I even have to explain this one? The game plan for this one went something like this: screenshot, text, laugh-react, and ignore. If you happen to be the ~spicy~ type and want to go for it, just know there’s going to be some serious bro code group chats in your future — good luck.
That #1 friend-match that apparently doesn’t want a free meal
Yeah. This hurt. It’s literally free food. Call me narcissistic (please don’t), but is 45 minutes with me too much to handle for free boba? I can’t be that bad. Maybe I should’ve unlinked my Spotify? I knew Shawn Mendes was a red flag…
Anyway, here’s to hoping next year goes any better — and, dear Cupids, please find me someone new to simp over.
