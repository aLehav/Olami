Drag is a nexus in the whole sphere of art,” student drag performer Casey R. Goggin ’19 says.
Amidst students’ half-century long fight for a multicultural center and an ongoing legal battle between single-gender social groups and the University, Harvard students have long grappled with creating and finding affirming spaces on campus.
For a growing contingent of student drag performers, drag — an art form that tackles definitions of expression, privilege, and identity — has emerged as a way of addressing this need. Though the venues and environments in which students perform vary widely, the central role of drag as community building reverberates throughout campus.
Harvard’s long history has been fraught with challenges when it comes to navigating BGLTQ identity. The Secret Court of 1920 — a secretive ad hoc tribunal consisting of five administrators led by then-Dean Chester Noyes Greenough — questioned and eventually removed a group of gay students and an assistant professor from the University. These removals followed the suicide of Cyril B. Wilcox ’22, who had recently confessed to having an affair with Harry Dreyfus, an older Boston man, to his brother George L. Wilcox ’14. After his brother’s death, George gathered names of other men suspected of participating in homosexual activities and presented his findings to Greenough, who then convened the court.
Members of the BGLTQ community at Harvard argue the University still has a ways to go despite its significant strides since The Secret Court. Just last year, BGLTQ graduate students spoke out about a lack of resources for the community, which prompted the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to respond by hiring a BGLTQ fellow. In December, graduate students submitted a proposal to administrators calling for more support structures for underrepresented minorities and BGLTQ students. In response to these criticisms, GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an email to the Crimson that the school remains committed to diversity-related programming, regularly working with student groups in a variety of capacities.
These issues of identity, representation, and support for the BGLTQ community are not confined to Harvard, however.
Jonathan M. Square is a History and Literature faculty member studying fashion and visual culture in the African Diaspora. “It’s important to remember the tension between thinking of Harvard as its own petri dish or microcosm, but also remembering that the walls are permeable. It’s in dialogue with things that are happening outside of Harvard,” Square says.
Drag is a prominent subculture that has taken root at Harvard. Drag in its most current, well-known form arose in the early 1900s from “ball culture,” a BGLTQ subculture known as the “house system” in which individuals performed in different drag categories to win prizes.
Excluded from “high society,” performers used drag as a way to experience “an executive realness,” according to Square.
“Within the space of these balls, they experiment with new identities and play the high society mistress, or the Wall Street banker, or the straight-presenting banjee boy, or the street walker,” Square says.
Despite their liberating potential, however, these spaces weren’t open to everyone. In response to historical exclusion, black performers decided to establish their own underground ball culture in the 1960s, which coincided with the Civil Rights Movement. The 1970s saw an increase in competition categories as well as participation of previously marginalized performers.
Campus performers today say situating and recognizing drag in its historical context shapes their understanding of its current iteration. NancyBoi is a student drag performer who asked The Crimson to only be identified by drag name.
“From Stonewall and trans women and drag queens of color rebelling against the institutions and laws of that time and subverting these things in a time when that was not as accepted as it is, trying drag here gave me a greater connection to the greater history of drag in the U.S. context and other people of color in the queer community,” NancyBoi says.
For the last three decades, Adams House Drag Night has been one of the house’s proudest traditions. Featuring drag performances by students, tutors, and current faculty deans Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, the annual event is deeply symbolic of Adams House’s identity and history.
“Adams House has an important tradition of being inclusive — inclusive of racial identities, inclusive of gender identities, and sexual orientations — and putting that on stage for whoever wants to be on stage,” Bailey Colfax ’19, former Adams House Committee chair, says. “I think that’s a nice assertion of why Adams House is special. No matter what oppressed group you remain a part of, you are welcome and supported in our house.”
Before the randomization of Harvard’s upperclassmen house lottery system, Adams was known as a safe haven for those in the performing arts and members of the BGLTQ community, according to the house’s website. After an assault by three Kirkland House students on a gay Adams House resident in 1980, the House came together and organized the first Adams House drag ball in a show of support.
Through many conversations within the House committee and with the broader Adams House community, Drag Night has undergone several changes. Though Adams Drag Night was initially conceived as a drag ball, the event has since incorporated drag ball elements into a more standard house-wide social event. During the most recent Drag Night, former house committee co-chairs Colfax and Brady Stevens ’19 delivered a speech to educate audience members about Drag Night’s history and importance. The Office of BGLTQ Student Life helped edit the speech to ensure sensitivity and accuracy in language used.
One student, whom the Crimson granted anonymity because he has concerns about being outed at home, performed at Drag Night for the first time last year. He says the performances were a way for people in the House to learn and support each other, and also serves as a reminder of people coming from backgrounds where their identities weren’t accepted.
“It’s a reminder of how people were treated in the past for whatever they identified as and how we can support them,” he says. “I grew up somewhere where something like this would be unheard of.”
Drag Night has received resounding support from Adams House residents, according to Colfax. In anonymous surveys sent out to the house, students have shared the deeply personal ways Drag Night helped them come to terms with their identity.
“They said they were very uncertain about their own gender identity and were very uncomfortable conforming to what they believed were the expectations for how they presented and how they dressed,” Colfax says of a specific anonymous student response. “Being able to play with that on Drag Night itself maybe inspired an awakening in them and made them realize that it wouldn’t be weird within Adams House.”
For student performers, Drag Night is a freeing space. The fact that Drag Night is open to everyone regardless of gender and sexuality means students who have yet to come out can perform without being outed.
Another student, whom the Crimson granted anonymity because she also has concerns about being outed at home, performed at Drag Night after coming out just a few months before.
“Literally anyone can go on that stage and do whatever they want. No one asks any questions,” she says.
While Adams Drag Night has been a longtime house tradition held annually in Adams Dining Hall, Saskia’s Incorporated has provided an emerging counterpoint to college-supported drag. Founded in 2017 and described on its Facebook page as a “a DJ/artist collective building community and safe spaces for queer people, womxn, and QPOC (queer people of color),” Saskia’s is a growing scene among the BGLTQ community at Harvard.
Luke A. Martinez ’19 founded Saskia’s Inc. in 2017. DJ Saskia, Martinez’s alter ego who DJs at Saskia’s parties, arose as an outlet to express their femininity. Though Saskia is not a drag queen, Martinez is invested in creating spaces for drag performers on campus. Following their experiences in techno clubs around Berlin two summers ago, Martinez, who is studying ethnomusicology, was determined to replicate those kinds of spaces back in Cambridge.
Sonya Kalara ’21, who currently helps organize Saskia’s parties, said they have found them empowering.
“Saskia’s is the one time a semester that you could just be fully in yourself,” Kalara says. “Harvard is not really a place that encourages divergence from the norm, but Saskia’s is fully built on the idea of divergence and loving yourself because of it.”
Bringing together DJs, drag performers, and attendees from across Greater Boston, a night at Saskia’s typically begins with two hours of DJing, followed by drag performances by around a dozen performers and concluding with more dancing and music, according to Kalara. Though many of Saskia’s parties, which occur once every semester, have taken place in the Cabot Aquarium, the collective has more recently expanded to other venues such as Elks Lodge in Cambridge.
Frustrated with the lack of BGLTQ spaces on campus as well as BGLTQ party and drag spaces for those under 21 years old in Boston, Martinez founded Saskia’s with the history of the house music scene — an alternative, underground scene mostly consisting of black and Latinx gay men — in mind.
“Queer people deserve to have amazing music on an amazing sound system with amazing people dancing right next to them,” Martinez says. “They deserve to have a space where they can go and just throw everything to the wind.”
Saskia’s has intentionally centered around BGLTQ people and people of color, attempting to create a necessary space and audience for performers in that community at Harvard and in Greater Boston, according to Goggin, a performer and organizer at Saskia’s.
“What is supremely important to me for all spaces, but especially Saskia’s, is having a space that is explicitly and essentially at its core a safe place that is centered around and made for queer people, and women, and people of color, and queer people of color, and any targeted person under the sun — with a loose center around those who are the most marginalized,” Goggin says.
The “empowering” and liberating nature of Saskia’s derives from the organization’s explicit service to the BGLTQ community and its place in the “underground,” detached from the University and beyond the University.
“Saskia’s is fundamentally not about Harvard,” Kalara says. “You can be and do whatever you want to. It just really became a space of healing and appreciation of the beauty of queerness for me in a visceral and real way.”
Goggin attested to the discomfort of performing in front of a majority cisgender, heterosexual audience — especially because they say their performance is intended for those “who aren’t safe in the outside world, who don’t have that space, particularly those at Harvard who don’t have those space.”
While Goggin believes that drag should ultimately be for everyone, they certainly acknowledge — and encourage others to acknowledge — the power structures at play in any drag performance space.
“You’re absolutely still welcome,” Goggin says. “But you have to acknowledge and be conscious of the fact that you have however many layers of privilege and the people the space is centered around don’t have those layers of privilege.”
As an inherently personal art form, drag is subject to the whims of its performers who have significant license in the messages they wish to convey. For some Harvard performers, drag serves as a way to explore their identity.
“I grew up in the American South. I was closeted for a lot of my childhood. I started coming out my senior year of high school, and I wasn’t out to my family at all when I started,” Goggin says.
For Goggin, time at Harvard has been a continual growing experience. Experimenting with drag has been a key part of that process.
“By my sophomore year of college, I started coming into conflict with my own gender identity and my own gender presentation. For a long time, I thought maleness was unsettling to me just because I didn’t like it socially or institutionally,” Goggin says. “I think for the longest time, I wrote off my discomfort as general discomfort with feeling implicated in patriarchy. I started dressing in a lot more of a fluid way. I was living with roommates who were very encouraging and validating.”
Reminiscing on their journey, Goggin smiles.
“I started crossdressing for myself and it felt good,” they say. “I wasn’t doing it very intentionally. I was literally doing it because it felt good.”
For others, drag’s position in challenging gender norms addresses ongoing conversations about structural inequities and to call in the marginalized.
Last year, RuPaul came under fire for justifying barring cisgender women as well as transgender women who have not fully transitioned from participating in the show, claiming that women’s participation in drag subverts the “irony” and “danger” of male performers shedding and rejecting their masculinity. In January, Drag Race Thailand cast its first-ever cisgender female competitor.
Many performers refuse to adhere to these expectations.
For performers like NancyBoi, drag is about examining structures with a critical eye and tearing down barriers.
“I like to look at gender through the lens of androgyny and the idea of not fitting on either side of the binary,” NancyBoi says. “So while I do wear wigs and do my nails and do makeup, I tend not to pad, since I like the aspects of maleness that is seen within femaleness and the blending of masculinity and femininity into an entirely new thing.”
In the wake of Harvard’s ongoing battle with exclusive organizations, most notably its remaining final clubs, drag, an artform built on inclusivity of identities, serves more than just performance or hobby; it’s about solidarity.
“As an art form, it’s very unique because when you keep in mind where it comes from and what it should do, in my opinion, drag is not just art for presentation,” Goggin says. “It’s community building.”
Navigating this type of performance within an institution as long-lived as Harvard brings about a special set of challenges and opportunities for performers. Performers recognize both the distinguished nature of Harvard’s physical spaces, while offering new interpretations on how to repurpose them. Dining halls and common rooms are often beautifully outfitted, but cannot always be easily reserved for late night events. Baby Satin, a student drag performer who asked The Crimson to only be identified by their drag name, says the University offers unique venues with potential.
“[Harvard] has many cool spaces. Especially because drag is so visual, it would be really cool if we could use the spaces in a more non-structured way,” Baby Satin says.
For some performers, it is not the issue of physical space, but rather affirmative social space that drag seeks to address. Goggin pushes back against the idea of inaccessible spaces on the campus social scene.
“I’m interested in spaces that are genuinely communal and what that means to me is the space is not owned by any one person,” they say. “It’s shared and it operates cooperatively.”
In certain enclaves, including ones as prominent as Adams House, students believe drag has taken on the role of fostering inclusivity. But navigating drag at Harvard continues to challenge students involved in the scene. “We play roles in negotiating institutions whether we like it or not, whether it’s intentional or not, whether it’s conscious or unconscious,” NancyBoi says.
The question remains whether drag, rooted in subverting and challenging norms, will ever become commonplace on campus.
“It should be mainstream, because engagement in drag teaches you how much power you have to shape the way people see you. And I think that power can be translated into other arenas,” Square says. “Your individual power is a reflection of collective power.” 
Some performers, though, remain unconvinced that drag will, or even ought to, become mainstream as an art form. For these artists who have taken comfort in their drag shows, the unseen offers both intrigue and power.
“I think drag still lives in liminality and underground,” NancyBoi says. “I think that’s very evident here at Harvard.”
Baby Satin echoed the sentiment, asserting that drag’s ability to remain unseen unless sought out facilitates its subversiveness.
“Underground drag is so powerful because it’s going against the mainstream, going against something which gives it strength and community which doesn’t need validation from an institution,” Baby Satin says.
What these student performers can ultimately agree on is the important purpose that drag plays on campus in fostering inclusive spaces, particularly ones for the BGLTQ community.
“The heart of drag, and what distinguishes it as an art form, is that it does build queer community," Goggin says. “It’s supposed to call people in, who need a space, who need to see what is possible for them in terms of how they can exist in the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the surface, it’s kind of ridiculous that it’s taken Marvel 11 years to release one movie led by a woman. There are plenty of female superhero characters in the comic books they’re based on (30.9 percent of the Marvel world and 30.6 percent of DC). And yet, in the 20 movies the studio put out before Captain Marvel, it didn’t have space for a single female lead.
But on the other hand, it’s not really that surprising. Superhero movies have a formula that has worked: There’s a good guy, his supportive and usually hard-to-get girlfriend, some villain he needs to defeat, a world on the edge of chaos, and an eventual happy ending. A little tired, but it sells.
The long-awaited “Captain Marvel” attempts to simultaneously conform to the mold and get credit for being groundbreaking. It serves up a mediocre-at-best heroine with nothing new to bring to the tired realizing-you-have powers archetype than her gender. Brie Larson is painfully generic in her cookie cutter blonde bob and almost nonexistent personality. The story is jarring, the pacing is off, and the audience never gets a good reason to care about a single green CGI alien.
But that’s not really the point. The problem is that the movie has no idea why it exists, what it’s trying to be, or who its main character is. “Captain Marvel” just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and her femininity is only ever a detractor, not a contributor, to her ability to help people. Criticisms of her for being stereotypically “emotional” or physically “weak” by other characters are almost always left unanswered.
Why, then, does a woman shouldering the responsibility of saving the world, instead of a man, matter? Is she a hero just because the men are busy, or the screenwriters couldn’t think of any other way to sell movie tickets? From the first scenes, it’s established that Captain Marvel can’t actually beat her male opponents in a fair fight. When locked in a hand-to-hand fight with her male sparring partner, she loses, as he then reminds her, just like she “always” does.
In their penultimate final battle, that same opponent attempts to convince her to take him on in another hand-to-hand fight where she agrees not to use her powers. As triumphant music plays, Captain Marvel “beats” him by admitting her physical inferiority and relying on her superpowers to just blast him away instead of fighting him. That’s the opposite of an empowering message about female strength.
Are women equal to men only when they’re “given” physical dominance by some vaguely-defined extraterrestrial force? Are they worthy of narrative attention and positions of power just because they can blast photons out of their hands? Good male superheroes have their weaknesses: Iron Man is arrogant, Spiderman is clumsy, the Hulk is angry. It’s obnoxious that the directors of “Captain Marvel” think they have a moral high ground because they’re presenting women whose only attribute is artificially-induced “strength.” Or, as many critics have noted, women “without insecurity.” If these movies want to include preachy montage scenes about a woman’s strength, they should back up that claim of empowerment by showing her good ideas, her ability to lead, her interesting thoughts and opinions. But instead, Captain Marvel herself feels utterly replaceable, a bland vessel for an electromagnetic something whose only narrative tension is trying not to be “too emotional.”
You’re not fighting for equality by proving you can punch harder. It’s only by respecting the humanity in one another that we can understand the real reasons why every person — regardless of gender, physical ability, or radioactive spider bites — can save the world in their own individual way. Just substituting a woman into the existing hierarchy of physical dominance doesn’t change anything.
At the end of the day, female superhero movies attempt to upend a formula without proving why that formula doesn’t work in the first place. Putting a blonde girl in a metal skirt and spandex and telling her to save the world is not radical. If these movies want to flaunt their in-your-face messages of “female empowerment,” they had better explain why women are powerful and where that power comes from. And that answer needs to be a lot stronger than whatever the hell a Tesseract is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The financial costs of having a family weigh heavily on student parents at Harvard, and the University must do more to improve the conditions of current and to-be student parents. Between childcare, dental, health insurance for dependents, and transportation, the prohibitive costs of having a family violate the University’s values of equity and inclusion. As a result, our elected Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers bargaining committee is currently negotiating to codify improvements to our working conditions and benefits in a union contract.
The cost of being a parent while a graduate student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is outrageous. Monthly childcare costs can exceed $3,000 for infants, completely cannibalizing a typical GSAS student stipend. On top of that, Harvard charges $7,178 to insure a spouse or partner and $3,802 to insure a minor.
If a graduate student is expected to take $11,000 — about a third of a graduate student stipend — just to insure their spouse and new child's healthcare costs, the remainder of their "fully funded" Ph.D. is insufficient support their young families. If we made the difficult decision to start our families during graduate school in spite of these financial burdens, we can only imagine that many prospective students’ family-planning priorities prevented them from starting their careers at Harvard, and countless student workers were forced to delay their family decisions due to a lack of financial support.
The administration subsidizes child care for faculty to up to $24,000 per year, with various child-care scholarships available. Surely, the University can also afford us child care support that also allows us to focus on our research and academic work.
In response to these concerns and other issues, student workers began organizing publicly to form a union in 2015. The administration suddenly became willing to make improvements: A 2015 flyer for an 11 percent discount for the semester MBTA pass was then accompanied by a half-off subsidy – a sum that has long been available for MIT graduate workers or Harvard employees — and parental leave was extended from no guaranteed leave in 2010 to 12 weeks of leave today. The increase from six weeks to 12 weeks leave coincided with the timing of the first unionization election during the 2016-2017 academic year.
Recent unionization efforts show that positive change happens only when student workers have organized to apply visible pressure. As support for graduate unionization grew on their campus, Columbia University went from only subsidizing half to fully waiving dependent healthcare premiums for students with funded Ph.D.s.
This April 18 will mark one year since the election forming our union, and we are still without the security of the union contract. It is no surprise that gains in these accommodations reversed and our uncertainty returned as soon as Harvard believed the potential for graduate students unionization had disappeared with the first flawed election in 2016.
But these improvements still fall short. Whether one continues to be paid a stipend during 12-week parental leave or is required to take courses appears to be at the discretion of the program and funding source. Many new parents have not known about the $6,516 one-time payment in support of a new or adopted child. The annual $542 fee for dental insurance covers little beyond two cleanings, forcing international students to delay needed dental work until their visits home. For those of us who cannot afford the housing costs in Cambridge and who commute, MBTA commuter rail passes still take out up to $3000 dollars per year from our already-tight budgets. Further, the MBTA subsidy applies only during the semesters, and our lab experiments do not stop during the summer months. The absence of any MBTA subsidy during the summer is a burden for those of us who cannot afford to live closer to campus with our families.
Our Harvard Graduate Students Union has been a critical vehicle for making these needs known to the administration, but we still have a long way to go. Our union and successive union contracts provide an opportunity to consolidate and document the vast improvements to working conditions for student parents. Having these provisions listed in a union contract may make it such that accessing benefits — such as the $6516 one-time-payment — is not a matter of word of mouth.
We urge the administration to realize the values it professes in inclusion and equity by completing our union contract by the end of this academic year. It is ironic that, even at the world’s wealthiest university, those of us doing cutting-edge research to advance human healthcare and improve the human condition continue to struggle to access basic housing, transportation, and healthcare services for ourselves and our loved ones.
With both of us expecting to graduate the coming year, a completed union contract with provisions that finally make graduate study viable for student parents would be a fitting way to conclude our graduate careers. In the meantime, Harvard could define itself as a leader in supporting graduate workforce, adding heft to its values of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years ago, a group of Harvard students sought to protest the University’s role in the Vietnam War. Around 500 students occupied University Hall refusing to leave until Harvard abolished its Reserve Officers’ Training Program, among other demands. The University called in city and state police; dozens of students were injured. But they did not act in vain, making lasting change that impacts the Harvard community to this day. As our campus witnesses a resurgence in student activism, the events of 50 years ago provide an important opportunity for reflection.
Protest is an essential component of a vibrant democracy — it is something to be promoted, not silenced. As students and journalists, we stand behind the beliefs that those in power must be held accountable for their actions and that morally repugnant actions should be met with an equally vigorous response.
While administrators may prefer students seek official channels for feedback, we believe that this method does not always achieve sufficient attention to create change. Speaking to protestors from the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that he responds to “reason” rather than “demands.” But in drawing this distinction, Bacow fails to recognize the degree to which demand and reason are not mutually exclusive. The passion of a demand does not undermine its logical origin, nor does reasoned thought preclude outrage or calls to action.
Moreover, in making this distinction, Bacow minimizes the degree to which student activists on this campus put considerable thought and discussion into the demands behind which they rally. Writing off protest as unreasoned — and here the proximity of reason with reasonableness should ring strongly — presents itself as dismissive to student protesters, despite the hopefully deep considerations and conversations being had about these important issues at the University level. As such, we urge Bacow and other administrators to think more broadly about what thoughtful discourse means, historically and in this present moment.
Bacow would not be the first University president to call upon students to act with reason. Nathan M. Pusey, who served as president during the 1959 University Hall occupation, responded by contrasting “thoughtful and concerned individuals” with a loud minority of “self-righteous zealots.” Though it would be unfair to compare Bacow and Pusey too closely, Bacow and other administrators — as they look to protests today — should take into consideration the history of protests on this campus, their receptions, and the legacies of their predecessors.
Protesters, too, should be historically conscious. Like their predecessors in 1969, protesters today have the power to make enormous change — for better or for worse. The 1969 protests not only contributed to the creation of an African-American studies program and affordable housing that Harvard built on Mission Hill, but also led to the ouster of ROTC from Harvard’s campus for more than 40 years.
Student activists cannot take this power to change lightly. Precisely because of this capacity to create such pivotal and long-lasting change, students must consider carefully about why, on whose behalf, and how they protest. They must have a clear sense of what they demand and how those demands will impact the world around them both for better and also for worse.
Finally, student activists should operate cooperatively. The 1969 protest boasted large numbers — thousands of students gathered in Harvard Stadium a few days after the University Hall sit-in. Coalition building between movements is as key today as it was in 1969, both because issues rarely exist in a vacuum and — as the 1969 protesters demonstrated — large movements attract considerably more attention.
We encourage students to continue to speak loudly and passionately for their beliefs as they work together to make this campus and the world beyond it a better place. And we encourage them to do so always with one eye fixed on the past and the other on the future they hope to build.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is no secret that Harvard undergraduates are believed to lack humility. Widely perceived as high-achievers but also entitled and elitist, we jokingly embrace this stereotype, often alluding to it in memes or self-deprecating humor. When asked where we go to college, we murmur “a school in Boston” as we believe that this is somehow less pretentious than the honest, straightforward “Harvard.” Such cosmetic charades are harmless; however, our lack of humility has translated into a lack of respect for the very things that we pretend to be modest about.
It is clear that we recognize that we will graduate Harvard with a valuable academic education, but we sometimes seem to forget whence this education comes. In the past semester, there have been a number of undergraduate protests against the denial of tenure to various Harvard professors. I have no specific opinion about any one of these cases and I have a great deal of respect for any Harvard faculty member and their body of work. But I do find it troubling, and — depending on my mood — almost comical, that 20-year olds with not even a bachelor’s degree yet think that they are qualified to opine on the scholarship worth of an academic — oftentimes more qualified even than a committee of tenured faculty, each of whom has striven for years to establish leadership positions in their chosen fields. And of course, the forcefulness extends beyond promotion decisions to termination demands, as, for example, in the insistence that a faculty dean be “removed” due to his choice of professional client.
In his remarkable “A Letter to the Director of the London School of Economics” penned in 1968 during the student protests at that institution, the philosopher Imre Lakatos, makes a distinction — that still resonates 50 years later — between student demands for free expression of complaints and criticism (including of academic matters) and student demands for power over appointments and syllabi. Lakatos views the former as entirely valid and justified, but the latter, he argues, “surreptitiously” converts a “revolt against academic paternalism into a political revolt against academic autonomy.” One may not agree in toto with Lakatos’ analysis, but the context in which he wrote is important: This was a man who had seen first hand the demands of Nazi students to suppress “Jewish-liberal- marxist influence” expressed in the syllabi, and later the efforts of the Lysenkoists and the Soviet Communist Party to murderously suppress dissenters in genetics research.
Today, the general sense of entitlement that we feel — “the coddling of the American mind,” as described by Greg Lukanioff and Jonathan D. Haidt — continues to be discussed by many academics and students alike. Lukanioff and Haidt discuss the increasingly common phenomenon of American college students demanding “protection” (i.e. trigger warnings) from words and ideas that they don’t like in the name of improving mental health. The duo argue that such systems of protection are not only deleterious to education and freedom of thought, but also harmful to students’ emotional well being. I will leave it to the reader to evaluate Lukanioff and Haidt’s claims, but one cannot deny that undergraduates today are pampered and cosseted by their institutions.
While I have yet to hear a Stanford student say that they “go to school in Palo Alto,” it is clear that these attitudes are not unique to Harvard students. No university is perfect. As students, we must not be apathetic or blindly compliant to every University policy, and it is important that we think critically and appropriately address problems when we see them. However, we must also be aware of our (lack of) stature and knowledge, and appreciate that we have much to learn from those who have paved the way for us to be here. As an old proverb states: “He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool; shun him.” Let us know that we indeed know not, and be grateful that those who know are willing to educate us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nancy R. Gibbs, the former editor-in-chief of Time magazine, was named the faculty director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy on Tuesday.
Her term as the director will start immediately, per a press release issued Tuesday. Gibbs is currently serving as a visiting professor of press, politics, and public policy at the Kennedy School. At Harvard Kennedy School, she has taught courses about the media and journalism.
In the press release, Gibbs praised the Shorenstein Center for teaming journalists and scholars together to pursue research.
“I am honored to have the chance to shape the center’s efforts at a time in which the changing media landscape and its relationship to our democracy are so crucial,” Gibbs wrote.
In 2013, she became the first woman to serve as Time magazine’s managing editor. She is also the author of two best-selling books about presidential history.
Prior to her leadership positions at Time, Gibbs was one of the most published writers in Time’s history, penning more cover stories than any other reporter. She covered four presidential campaigns and won a National Magazine Award for her cover story in Time’s September 11, 2001 special issue.
Gibbs will replace outgoing director Nicco Mele. Mele said in an interview on Tuesday he is stepping down to work on a new book about reality television and its impact on American politics.
Mele — the former senior vice president and deputy publisher of the Los Angeles Times — will retain his position as a lecturer of public policy at the Kennedy School. He said he is “honored” to have the chance to work with Gibbs in the future.
“Nancy has a deep and exceptional understanding of the challenges facing journalism, more than almost any other journalist in America,” Mele said. “She understands the complicated relationship between media, politics, and public policy.”
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in the press release he was “delighted” about Gibbs’ appointment.
“Nancy Gibbs is an extremely thoughtful and respected voice about the evolving role of the media in politics and society,” Elmendorf wrote. “She is distinguished by her impressive career at Time, culminating in the position of editor in chief, and by the contributions she has already made to the Kennedy School and to Harvard more broadly during her short time here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Friday that he is confident Harvard is on the right side of the law in a lawsuit alleging that Harvard unlawfully possesses and profits off two photographs of American slaves that are believed to be the oldest of their kind in existence.
Tamara K. Lanier filed the lawsuit against Harvard on March 20, alleging that the University illegally maintains the daguerreotypes, which she says depicts her great-great-great grandfather, Renty, and his daughter, Delia. She also alleges that Harvard played a role in perpetuating slavery. Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz commissioned the photos in the 19th century in an attempt to prove a theory of white superiority, according to the complaint.
Bacow took issue with Lanier’s claims that the school has “refused” to acknowledge its ties to the American slave trade and was profiting off of the images.
Though the University has yet to file a formal response to the claims, Bacow defended Harvard’s position, referencing former University President Drew G. Faust’s efforts to recognize Harvard’s complicity in slavery in an interview Friday.
In 2016, Faust, along with United States Representative John R. Lewis (D-Ga.), dedicated a plaque to four enslaved persons who lived and worked on campus in the 18th century. She also accepted a Harvard Law School committee’s recommendation to remove the school’s seal, which included the Royall family crest. Isaac Royall, Jr., whose family owned slaves in the 18th century, helped endow Harvard’s first law professorship.
“The suggestion that Harvard has failed to acknowledge its past links, or to engage on these issues, it's just not true,” Bacow said.
Bacow said the images were displayed with the intent to illustrate the slaves’ humanity.
“The way in which the University displayed the images of the daguerreotypes, my understanding from President Faust — and you may wish to speak to her — was designed specifically to call people's attention to the fact that these were not chattel,” Bacow said. “These were real people.”
Lanier’s lawyer, Joshua D. Koskoff, wrote in an emailed statement that Bacow’s comments do not absolve the University of the allegations filed in the lawsuit.
“President Bacow’s comments are sadly nothing more than a continuation of Harvard’s refusal to fully reckon with its past, as well as its ongoing campaign of belittling the legitimacy and seriousness of Ms. Lanier’s claims, that resulted in her having to file this lawsuit,” Koskoff wrote.
“We encourage all Harvard students to read our complaint and make up their own minds about whether they share President Bacow’s sentiments and whether the conduct of the institution reflects the laudable principles it claims to abide by,” he added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Koskoff’s statement, citing the fact that the suit is pending litigation.
In Friday’s interview, Bacow also said the University does not profit of the images and only charges a “nominal fee” for reproductions.
Though he said he is confident that the University is on the right side of this case, Bacow said he hopes the suit can stay out of the courts.
“I think we have the law on our side. Again, I would hope, though, that we could resolve this not purely by resort to legal process,” Bacow said. “I think there's recognition that we need to be sensitive in the utilization of these images.”
Bacow added that he hopes to “engage in a conversation” with the family about the photos.
“Our desire is not just simply to litigate this, but rather to engage in a conversation with family and see if we can reach some reasonable accommodation,” Bacow said.
However the University decides to respond to the daguerreotypes lawsuit, Bacow said the school has not hidden the images’ “troubling” circumstances.
“My understanding is that the University has acknowledged those circumstances,” Bacow said. “And it’s not tried to hide them in any way, shape, or form.”
Lanier’s lawsuit is not the only instance of Harvard revisiting its controversial past in recent weeks.
Two days after Lanier filed her suit in Middlesex Superior Court, incoming Lowell House Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser announced they would not display portraits of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and his wife Anna Parker Lowell, when the house reopens after its complete renovation in the fall.
Lowell served as University President from 1909 to 1933 and is remembered for creating the house system and integrating students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. He was also known, however, for being a racist, homophobe, xenophobe, and anti-Semite.
During Friday’s interview, Bacow said the decision to not to hang the portraits in the renovated Lowell House should be up to the Faculty Deans.
“The faculty deans are — David and Nina — are far closer to this than I am,” Bacow said.

Though much of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has seen recent increases in the proportion of underrepresented minority tenure and tenure-track faculty, the Sciences division continues to lag behind.
Students and faculty say this lack of diversity limits the perspective that faculty can add to their research, teaching, and mentorship and leaves minority students — and prospective faculty members — feeling they do not belong. Administrators acknowledge that more work remains to be done, but say they believe they are making progress in both recruitment and retainment.
An annual report on faculty diversity released last week shows that the proportion of tenured faculty in the Sciences who identify as Hispanic, African American, or Native American has remained at 5 percent when compared to 2015, whereas the rest of FAS has grown. And unlike in the Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the proportion of tenure-track faculty from underpresented minorities in the Sciences has fallen — from 10 percent to 3 percent — from 2015 to 2018.
As of Sept. 1, 2018, just one out of 31 tenure-track faculty members in the Sciences self-reported as an underrepresented minority. Recent hires have brought that figure up to four, according to Dean of Sciences Christopher Stubbs.
Still, over the 15-year period highlighted in last week’s report, the proportion of underrepresented minorities in the Sciences has increased — from 1.9 percent of ladder faculty in 2004 to 4.5 percent in 2019. The University’s ladder faculty comprises both tenured professors and those on the tenure track, including assistant and associate professors.
That incremental progress, though, is not enough for some students.
“The lack of diversity in the faculty for the Sciences has made me question my future more than once,” Arin L. Stowman ’19, president of the Harvard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, wrote in an email. “While I am confident in my own abilities, not seeing people who look like me in the positions that I want to be in someday makes me question whether there will ever be any space for me.”
The lack of diversity within the sciences extends beyond Harvard. Hakim J. Walker, a mathematics preceptor, said that while he has recently observed a field-wide push towards recruiting a diverse pool of faculty, he believes there has historically been a lack of drive surrounding diversity initiatives throughout his career.
“I think that's kind of the ethos of many math departments, and many mathematicians, is we care about your talent, we care about whether or not you can contribute and gain something from the math curriculum here,” Walker said. “I think we're seeing more of a push against that in more recent years.”
The pipeline of underrepresented minority Ph.D.s remains slim. According to data released by the National Science Foundation, 27 Black and 35 Hispanic students received a Ph.D. in mathematics and statistics out of a total of 1864 recipients in 2014, amounting to 1.4 and 1.9 percent, respectively. The fractions of underrepresented minorities who have recently received Ph.D.s in other fields within the sciences are similarly low, with none above 5 percent.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay said in a March interview she believes Harvard plays a vital role in helping to expand that pipeline. For example, the University currently funds summer research opportunities for minority undergraduates across the country to attract talented scholars at an early age and encourage them to apply to graduate school.
“I don’t think there is any field in which there’s truly no pipeline, but yeah, there are some fields where in terms of the level of gender diversity, racial and ethnic diversity, it’s not as robust as we’d like it to be,” Gay said. “There are things we could be doing at Harvard to help build that pipeline.”
Stubbs outlined a number of measures the Sciences have taken to address the pipeline issue, including implementing a “Future Faculty Fellows Program” to provide better advising for minority students. The Astronomy department is also piloting a new initiative in which it has eliminated the consideration of GRE scores in graduate student admissions.
Faculty and administrators said conducting broad faculty searches and looking for young scholars from underrepresented backgrounds are key mechanisms for increasing diversity. Gay said in a March interview that seeking out prospective hires as opposed to waiting for applicants to apply is a vital component of ensuring diverse applicants are considered.
“We have to be proactive in making sure that that we are really activating our networks, attending professional conferences and actually setting up a booth at professional conferences where there might be opportunities to kind of get Harvard in front of people who could be strong candidates for positions here,” she said.
Yet ultimately, hiring decisions depend on an applicant’s body of work, according to Charles M. Lieber, chair of the department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, who noted that his department has implemented numerous formal and informal mechanisms to ensure minority applicants are fairly considered in searches.
“It just can't be solved by just saying ‘Okay, we're going to hire “x” number of different faculty,’ because if there isn't a pool of viable, strong candidates, it is not a good thing to hire a weak candidate,” Lieber said.
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences — one of the few schools currently increasing its faculty ranks due to recent donations and its upcoming expansion into Allston — offers a counterpoint. Nineteen percent of SEAS’s tenure-track faculty are underrepresented minorities, compared to six percent in the life sciences and zero percent in the physical sciences as of September 2018.
The disparity between the proportion of tenure-track faculty in the sciences at Harvard compared to engineering could in part reflect differing levels of support at the undergraduate level, according to some faculty and administrators. Without support at the undergraduate level, students may feel limited in their ability to pursue an academic career in the sciences, creating a vicious cycle.
Walker said student affinity groups provide essential support for minority students.
“You need the right number and type of people with the initiative — and the time honestly — to form a group, make it a strong presence on campus, and sustain [it],” Walker said.
SEAS has recognized chapters of both the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, while the College does not have any student groups dedicated exclusively to serving underrepresented minorities in the sciences.
The Black Premedical Society caters to black undergraduates seeking to pursue a career in medicine and the Harvard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers serves all black STEM students at the College.
Stowman said that the need for HSBSE stems from Harvard’s lack of support for minority students.
“Ideally, the university would already be providing multiple levels of support to black students studying STEM knowing the history that exists and that has kept black people out of STEM,” Stowman said. “However, because those options do not yet exist, it is up to organizations like HSBSE to provide for students.”
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on criticisms about Harvard’s lack of support for students and faculty diversity.
Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser acknowledged that certain fields, such as mathematics, could “put more effort” into developing outreach programs such as those already available in engineering and physics.
Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21, the founder of the Black Premedical Society, wrote in an email that she believes the lack of diversity among faculty affects the curriculum of science classes at Harvard.
“I can only assume a lack of institutional support across the board for Black premedical students aids in this problem of underrepresentation,” she wrote. “I would highly encourage Harvard to consider how adding minority voices to its faculty could enhance our perspective on medicine and could aid in generating a future force of well-rounded, diverse doctors.”
Several students and faculty commended initiatives SEAS has taken to promote diversity and minority recruitment, including the hiring of a director of diversity and inclusion, Alexis J. Stokes. SEAS has also begun to require incoming faculty to submit a “diversity statement” as a part of their application and now offers diversity-related trainings for faculty and staff.
Gay said in March that she plans to “study” the success of those initiatives before deciding whether to roll them out on a broader scale.
Rahel M. Imru ’21, incoming president of HSBSE, wrote in an email that while she agrees that engineering has become more diverse, she still believes black students are not “properly represented” in either engineering or the sciences.
“I have noticed that SEAS is more diverse than the life and physical science departments, but from what I see, I still do believe that the number of Black faculty members is at an alarmingly low level in both,” she wrote.
Outside forces and internal constraints could inhibit efforts to further diversify the faculty, according to some administrators and department chairs.
After the 2008 recession, FAS instituted a hiring freeze. Though FAS resumed normal hiring practices several years later, the school still faces limits in the number of faculty it can hire every year. FAS generally must wait for a tenured faculty member to leave before hiring a new member.
Currently, the faculty turnover each year across the University stands at roughly 70, only half of whom are in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, according to Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer. The lack of turnover limits opportunities to diversify the school.
The historically racially homogenous makeup of FAS could also affect its ability to hire faculty from underrepresented backgrounds, according to multiple department chairs in the Sciences.
Lieber said some of his “senior colleagues” once had “very different views” about the importance of diversity in the sciences, though many have since changed their views. Still, he and others said they remain cognizant of implicit biases when hiring new faculty.
“There can be hidden biases because of how you’re brought up, what time you're brought up, if you don't make an effort to, you know, learn about things,” Lieber said.
Venkatesh Murthy, chair of the Molecular and Cellular Biology department, said the low diversity figures among science faculty could in part be contributing to a self-perpetuating cycle, in which prospective hires are unwilling to “take a chance” with a department lacking individuals who share similar backgrounds.
“The existing palette of people here clearly makes an impression,” he said. “If we’re all male, we're all a certain kind, then it becomes more difficult even if we convey verbally or maybe even through actions, that we are welcoming.”
The departure of even one of a few underrepresented minorities can have an immediate and lasting effect on faculty demographics, Lieber said.
He cited the case of chemist Alán Aspuru-Guzik, who won numerous awards after joining the faculty in 2006. Asparu-Guzik — who identifies as Hispanic — told The Crimson last year that he left Harvard to take a position at the University of Toronto due to “uncertainty” about his future in the wake of the election of President Donald Trump.
“Because you're working with small numbers, these percentages can fluctuate quite a lot, at least in our department,” Lieber said. “You try to bring up a young faculty, and then factors out of your control can change things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard Divinity School students have joined undergraduates in criticizing the school's decision to deny Associate Professor Ahmed Ragab tenure in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton this week.
Ragab is the first Muslim faculty member to come up for tenure at the Divinity School, according to the letter. In the letter, members of the Harvard Divinity School Students Association praised Ragab’s teaching and mentorship of students from underrepresented groups. They asked the Divinity School to review his tenure process and reconsider him, citing the school’s mission of “building a world in which people can live and work together across religious and cultural divides.”
“We strongly believe that the denial of tenure to Professor Ragab is antithetical to the vision of this institution,” the students wrote.
Multiple members of HDSSA’s board did not respond to request for comment or declined to discuss the letter.
The HDSSA letter is the second large-scale student statement sent to administrators about Ragab since his tenure denial. Last week, hundreds of students and alumni signed a letter denouncing the Divinity School’s decision and calling on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — where Ragab holds an affiliate position — to put Ragab up for tenure review. The undergraduates' and alumni's letter said Ragab is the first scholar at the Divinity School in a decade to be denied a full professorship without receiving a review from an ad hoc tenure committee.
Both letters pointed to Ragab’s scholarly contributions, contending that he is the “most published” professor of any who has come up for tenure at the school in the past two decades.
Ragab — who is the director of the Science, Religion and Culture program at the Divinity School — did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Divinity School does not appear to publish its tenure policies on its website.
Divinity School spokesperson Gordon M. Hardy declined to comment on the most recent letter, pointing to an earlier statement in which he said the school does not publicly discuss individual tenure cases. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on behalf of Bacow and Garber.
HDSSA’s letter also called on the Divinity School to increase the “transparency” of its tenure process, arguing that decisions about whether to grant tenure affect not only professors preparing for tenure, but also their advisees and the broader community.
“Many students were wholly unaware of the Divinity School’s decision until weeks after the decision; it is still unclear as to what the exact reasons for denial of tenure were,” the letter reads. “We maintain that releasing the rationale behind Professor Ragab’s denied tenure, as well as future decisions regarding tenure, is vital to the health of this community."

Harvard has put forward its economic proposals outlining compensation and benefits for student workers represented by the graduate student union in a bargaining session Monday, University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday.
The University’s proposals — which came a month after Harvard Graduate Students Union–United Automobile Workers presented its full set of economic proposals — drew heavy criticism from union negotiators.
Harvard has estimated that the union’s economic proposal will double expenditures for each graduate student, according to Garber’s email. He wrote that the union’s proposal would have a “significant” financial impact on the University.
“Were the University to agree to these proposals, there would likely be direct consequences for the number of graduate students who could be supported,” Garber wrote in the email.
Union bargaining committee member Ashley B. Gripper, however, contended that the University’s proposals did not adequately address student concerns.
“The administration’s proposed economic package, taking into account cost of living increases, would likely amount to a net loss for student workers over the next three years and a net loss as compared to the status quo,” Gripper wrote in an emailed statement.
The union described the University’s compensation plan as an “effective pay decrease” in a bargaining update posted to the group’s Instagram account. The proposed increase in graduate student stipends across a three-year period would be the smallest raise over a three-year period in a decade and would not keep up with the living cost, according to an HGSU-UAW bargaining update.
The University, however, contends that its proposals are “responsive” to the union’s requests.
“The University has put forward a strong set of economic proposals that are responsive to HGSU-UAW’s stated priorities and further recognizes the significant role student workers have in Harvard’s mission, while also ensuring their opportunity to succeed in their academic pursuits,” University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
The union also criticized the University’s proposals for childcare and a set minimum wage across Harvard, calling them inadequate. Gripper wrote that while more than 400 student workers at Harvard are parents, Harvard’s proposal would only cover the cost of childcare for 14 children.
Gripper also said the University’s $15 minimum wage proposal is lower than current standards in most departments. Current Massachusetts law stipulates a $12 hourly minimum wage. The living wage at Boston is calculated to be $14.85, according to the City of Boston.
Swain wrote that Harvard’s proposal would ensure salary increases.
“The University’s proposals would guarantee salary increases for the next three years for non-hourly student workers, including research assistants and teaching fellows/assistants, while raising the minimum pay rate for hourly workers,” Swain wrote in the statement.
Swain also wrote that the University’s proposal is in line with the contractual terms negotiated by United Automobile Workers – HGSU’s affiliated international union – at other institutions and informed by data that included the living wage rate for the Boston-Cambridge area.
“It would also extend additional student worker benefits HGSU-UAW has advocated for, including creating new funds for child care, emergency grants, dental coverage and healthcare coverage for dependents,” Swain wrote.
Harvard and HGSU-UAW’s economic proposals are not the end, but the starting point, for the negotiations surrounding economic issues, wrote William A. Herbert, the executive director for the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York.
“During the bargaining, it is likely that the parties will be discussing the overall cost of the respective proposals, the negotiated economic packages at other institutions, and ways to reach agreement acceptable to both sides,” Herbert wrote in an email.
Garber’s email comes just a few days before the one-year anniversary of student workers’ vote to unionize at Harvard. On Thursday, HGSU-UAW will release an ad campaign across national television networks criticizing Harvard’s approach to handling allegations of sexual harassment on campus.
HGSU-UAW has repeatedly called on Harvard to agree to a proposal that would allow student workers to pursue a third-party grievance procedure for resolving sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. Harvard has countered, arguing that the school’s current Title IX processes — with small adjustments — are sufficient.

Residents of Cambridge and neighboring cities, including several Harvard affiliates, testified in front of the Cambridge City Council Housing Committee on its proposed “100% Affordable Housing Zoning Overlay” at City Hall Tuesday.
The proposed zoning reform would incentivize affordable developers to build residential units across the city, aiding them to successfully compete with for-profit developers. The legislation would also amend zoning regulations to increase approval process efficiency, reduce costs, and facilitate new affordable housing construction. Tuesday’s hearing is the latest step in the rezoning process and follows a roundtable discussion within the Housing Committee last week.
City Councilor E. Denise Simmons called Tuesday's meeting to order, and urged councilors and residents alike to “remember the human element” during the process.
“Ultimately, we're talking about people, families,” she said. “And we're talking about doing what we can to allow our affordable housing to be built in the fairest way possible throughout our city.”
Many advocates for the overlay referenced the housing crisis in Cambridge, which they said made immediate expansion of affordable housing urgent. Among them were more than a dozen Harvard affiliates, including College students.
Zoe L. Hopkins ’22 argued that affordable housing is a critical way to support Harvard employees who cannot afford to live in Cambridge. Hopkins, who said she spoke on behalf of the Student Labor Action Movement, referred to Harvard employees as the “lifeblood” of the University.
“How can Harvard, how can Cambridge, call itself a community when many people who have dutifully served are denied the ability to live here because it isn't financially viable for them?” she asked. “To claim that it is legitimate to oppose this overlay because it will make neighborhoods less desirable or less attractive is not only a farce, but it is also an offensive and anti-poor afront to those who work tirelessly to support this community.”
Many attendees said that while they support affordable housing efforts, they are unsatisfied with the current proposal. They cited the lack of a complete and comprehensive plan; concerns that the city is rushing the process; and the exitence of an “As of Right” provision, a designation that would protect affordable housing developments from certain court challenges.
Cambridge resident Patrick W. Barrett III said that he supports affordable housing efforts, but is concerned Cambridge is rushing the project. He urged the city to carefully consider the proposal, saying that now is the “time to get it right.”
“Keep it in committee, work on it, make it do something that it’s supposed to, but also don't forget the people who live here in the residence,” he said.
Meeting attendee Francis “Fritz” E. Donovan ’59, who also resides in Cambridge and favors affordable housing, described the current proposal as a “mess.”
“Cambridge needs a well-thought-out plan that both increases affordable housing and enhances quality of life in our wonderful city,” he said. “The 100 percent affordable housing overlay plan is a disaster. We need to go back to the drawing boards and do it right.”
After the meeting, Mayor Marc C. McGovern said in an interview with The Crimson that regardless of how many meetings the city holds, there will always be dissent. But he said he is “frustrated” by residents who constantly oppose the city’s proposals.
“I'm a little frustrated that some of the more vocal opposers to the overlay refuse to acknowledge that there has been movement by the city to address their concerns,” he said.
The Housing Committee will consider the overlay proposal again at a meeting April 25 and vote on whether to advance the proposal to the City Council Ordinance Committee. McGovern said that he plans on voting for the proposal and that the Council needs to advance the proposal.
“At the end of the day, we need to move this forward,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker offered advice to students hoping to persuade the University to divest from companies tied to the fossil fuel industry at an event at the Center for Government and International Studies Tuesday.
More than a dozen Harvard affiliates and college students from nearby universities attended the event, which was organized by Divest Harvard, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Action Coalition, and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. Parker is an economist who co-founded the left-leaning magazine Mother Jones and served as an economic advisor to Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou.
Divest Harvard — a fossil fuel divestment advocacy group — has recently stepped up its efforts to encourage the University to divest Harvard’s nearly $40 billion endowment from fossil fuel-related companies.
On April 4, roughly 30 protesters from the Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign interrupted a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event. A week later, Divest Harvard and the Harvard Political Union held a forum on divestment attended by University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Parker has not been a part of the previous events.
Parker said that while it might not be evident that students could match the power of the University’s administration, they had “already won” in one respect.
“I promise you, [there are] hundreds of millions, if not billions of people on the planet who think the same way you do,” Parker said. “Bacow and the Overseers know that they're outnumbered.”
Parker drew on his experience as a Civil Rights protester during the 1960s to suggest that students should not focus on persuading the Harvard administration, but, instead, “the ones who walk by when you’re handing out leaflets.”
“What you need to be doing is thinking about how many of those people you can cause to pause long enough to at least embarrass them into a kind of engagement that signals to the Bacows of the world, ‘Oh my god, they're building even more support,’” Parker said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred The Crimson to Harvard’s previous statement that its endowment should not be used to “achieve political ends, or particular policy ends.”
“There are other ways the University works to influence public policy, including through scholarship and research,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
Arielle Blacklow ’21, one of the founders of Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice, said the event — which was attended by students from several Harvard schools — was important to “build a coalition” between graduate students and undergraduates on the issue of divestment.
“When we think about the components of this movement, and our strategy, and who we're bringing together, everyone has a role to play in all of the different schools and colleges on Harvard’s campus,” Blacklow said.
Caleb D. Schwartz ’20, a former Crimson photo editor and organizer with HUEJ who coordinated the event, said the talk served as a “unique” way to engage activists because it focused on “how to actually get things done.”
“I think a lot of events that we have been holding have been focused on, you know, why the University should divest, bringing attention to everything, so it was nice to kind of take a step back,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz also said the event was part of the lead-up to next week’s “Heat Week” — a week-long series of events co-sponsored by HUEJ and Divest Harvard that aims to “draw attention to the severity of the climate crisis and raise the call for Harvard to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry,” according to HUEJ’s website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Virginia L. Giuffre sued Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz for defamation in federal court Tuesday, claiming he falsely accused her of perjury after she implicated him in a sex ring operated by billionaire Harvard donor Jeffrey E. Epstein.
Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, first brought allegations against Dershowitz in court in 2015, when she claimed that Epstein, a convicted sex offender, forced her to have sexual relations with Dershowitz multiple times starting at age 16. She is seeking a trial by jury in her defamation suit and at least $75,000 in damages.
Dershowitz has denied the allegations repeatedly, stating that he does not know Giuffre. He has also publicly called on Giuffre and Sarah Ransome — another woman who alleged in a separate suit that Epstein directed her to have sex with Dershowitz — to repeat their claims publicly so he can sue them for defamation.
“Using his role as a powerful lawyer with powerful friends, Dershowitz’s statements were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Roberts’s reputation and credibility; to cause the world to disbelieve Roberts; and to destroy Roberts’s efforts to use her experience to help others suffering as sex trafficking victims,” the complaint states.
Dershowitz said Tuesday that he “welcomes” the suit, that Giuffre’s allegations constitute perjury, and that he has evidence that will eventually exonerate him.
“I've been looking for an opportunity now for several years to be able to prove in a court of law that Virginia Giuffre made up this whole story,” he said. “I never met her. I have evidence from her own words.”
“I have done nothing improper in any way whatsoever, and I will prove that in the federal court,” he added.
The lawsuit alleges that Dershowitz has repeatedly lied about his involvement in Epstein’s activities, and calls him Epstein’s “attorney, close friend, and co-conspirator.”
In November 2018, the Miami Herald published a three-part series that identified around 80 women who say Epstein molested or sexually abused them between 2001 and 2006. The Herald also reported that Dershowitz, who served on Epstein’s six-person legal team, helped strike a plea deal with then-United States District Attorney R. Alexander Acosta that granted Epstein and other unnamed potential co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution.
Dershowitz has stated he only visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence one time and was never in the house in the presence of young women, according to Giuffre’s complaint. The complaint refutes those claims with statements from two former employees of Epstein — Juan Alessi and Alfredo Rodriguez. Both Alessi and Rodriguez allege they saw Dershowitz at the residence on multiple occasions, and Rodriguez confirmed Dershowitz was in the house at the same time as “young ladies.”
Another woman who alleges Epstein sexually assaulted her, Maria Farmer, has stated she saw Dershowitz enter Epstein’s New York City mansion on multiple occasions while she was working there and go upstairs while girls under the age of 18 were present.
Giuffre alleges in her lawsuit that Dershowitz began defaming Giuffre in response to the Herald’s reporting, accusing her of perjury and extortion to deter her from discussing allegations against Epstein and himself.
“The purpose and effect of these attacks has been to damage Robert’s reputation and credibility and to try to intimidate her into silence,” the complaint reads.
Giuffre states in the complaint that Dershowitz’s statements have caused her economic, psychological, mental, and emotional damage.
Dershowitz previously wrote in a letter to the Herald that he not only denied that he had sex with Giuffre, but that he disproved it during an independent investigation run by former FBI director Louis J. Freeh. Dershowitz told The Crimson on Tuesday that he is inviting the FBI to attend and “monitor” the trial.
Giuffre’s lawyer, Joshua Schiller, wrote in an emailed statement that Giuffre and her legal team “look forward” to Dershowitz’s cooperation in the trial.
“Ms. Giuffre’s complaint makes detailed factual allegations, including allegations supported by exhibits and sworn affidavits,” Schiller wrote. “Mr. Dershowitz needs to address those allegations with something more than emotional conclusory denials and ad hominem attacks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard hosted a day-long conference entitled “Young, Gifted & Well” to promote discussion about mental health and wellness among students of color at the University at the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Tuesday.
The University collaborated with the Graduate School of Education, the School of Public Health, and the Steve Fund, which is an organization devoted to supporting the emotional well-being of young people of color.
The conference began with welcoming speeches from representatives of the Steve Fund and University officials, including Provost Alan M. Garber '76, Dean of the Graduate School of Education Bridget T. Long, and Senior Advisor and Strategist to the University President John S. Wilson.
Garber first addressed the audience, speaking about the importance of students' well-being. Last week, Harvard’s Office of the Provost announced the creation of a new task force dedicated to examining and promoting student mental health and wellness on campus.
“It's a particularly acute issue for students of color, and for students of marginalized groups of all kinds,” Garber said. “We increasingly recognize that we need to develop solutions that will address the very needs of our students in our University.”
After introductory remarks, conference attendees participated in four plenaries, including “Cultural and Social Determinants of Mental and Emotional Health,” “Intersectionality and Mental Health,” “Reflections,” and “Promising Practices: How to Foster Well-Being in Students of Color.” Attendees also had an opportunity to engage in five smaller breakout sessions, which facilitated conversations about mental health.
During the first plenary, Josephine M. Kim, a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education, spoke about the factors that play into the mental and emotional health of students of color.
“We're looking at social determinants of mental and emotional health of students of color, which are conditions in which they live, study, learn, participate, socialize and grow,” Kim said. “And the circumstances are shaped by distribution of power, resources, representation, sense of inclusion, and belonging at the campus level.”
The breakout sessions discussed topics ranged from “Decolonizing Mental Health” to “Resilience through Art.” Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services also led a session about self-care and mental health in college.
The fourth plenary featured David Rivera, a member of the Steve Fund’s Knowledge Committee, who spoke about the need for inclusivity on campus and the importance of diverse counseling services.
“You could have the most dynamic counseling center full of culturally competent therapists, but if students aren’t feeling the campus is inclusive, they’re not going to go seek out that support if they’re isolated,” Rivera said.
“Silence about mental health issues is too much a part of the narrative of mental health for communities of color, and we need to start changing that narrative, to have positive messages and stories of persistence,” he added.
Deepali B. Ravel, a lecturer at the Medical School, said that although there are many mental health resources on campus, students do not always know how to access them.
“There’s starting to be this sea of resources here, but students don’t necessarily know about them and they’re not necessarily being told how to use them,” Ravel said.
In his closing remarks, Wilson said the conference is going to initiate conversations "to change our culture at Harvard University and change it throughout American higher education.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2019 Masters Tournament was one that will go down in history. This past weekend the world’s best golfers convened on Augusta, Ga. for arguably the sport’s biggest event.
“When you start hearing the commercials and you hear the music, it’s really that turning point where it’s spring now and the season’s going,” said Harvard golfer and sophomore Ollie Cordeiro. “It’s really great and there are so many historic moments from that tournament, so it’s a pretty big deal for most every golfer.”
What took place was something no one would’ve believed a few years ago. After four entertaining rounds of golf, the sports world erupted when Tiger Woods captured his fifth green jacket and 15th major championship overall. Only Jack Nicklaus, with six Masters and 18 major wins, tops Woods in those two categories.
“I’ve been watching a lot of pro tournaments over the last four years and I have never seen a crazier tournament in that time,” said Cordeiro’s fellow teammate Grant Fairbairn. “There were so many people in contention and in the hunt throughout the entire tournament, and for Tiger to come out on top, that was really special.”
The way it unfolded for Tiger was impressive. It was his first major championship victory without having at least a share of the lead through 54 holes. He began Sunday two shots back of Francesco Molinari, who sat at 13 under par. Six birdies in the final round, including back-to-back birdies on the 15th and 16th holes, propelled Woods to the top of the leaderboard.
“To see what he’s able to do on the course is reminiscent of the way he used to be, in a way that I had never really experienced before,” Cordeiro said. “That’s what made it such a cool moment, to watch what may be the greatest player ever do what he did in his prime, but today in this age.”
That being said, it was Tiger’s journey over the years that made this Masters victory truly special. A combination of personal issues and injuries derailed his career. It appeared he would never again return to good form and reach the pinnacle of the golf world.
However, Tiger slowly crawled his way back, taking on hurdle after hurdle, and experiencing setback after setback. His wait lasted longer than a decade, but eventually it all came together for him. This was Woods’ first major championship since 2008 and first Masters since 2005.
The grit he displayed by staying true to this course is an inspiration for athletes and non-athletes alike. Not many people have what it takes to replicate such a feat in the face of so much adversity.
“It’s super motivating,” Fairbairn said. “Golf is a mental battle in each round in every tournament. Just seeing how Tiger can persevere Fand come back from so many bad things in his life is pretty motivational.”
Woods’ influence on the game over his career has been undeniable. Wherever he’s gone and whatever he’s done, throngs of fans and media members have followed, both figuratively and literally.
That’s why his recent rise back to relevance has been a welcome sight for so many. This translated to Sunday’s final round having the highest metered-market ratings for a morning golf broadcast since at least 1986.
“This is huge for the game of golf, that Tiger won,” Fairbairn said. “It was a super improbable thing that many of us never thought we’d see again. Tiger brings in so many people to the game that wouldn’t really care about golf otherwise.”
Almost 900 miles away in New Haven, Conn., another golf tournament was taking place on the same weekend as the Masters. On Saturday, the Crimson men’s golf team placed fifth at the Yale Opener in a field of 12 teams.
Although the group was focused on its own tournament, thoughts of the Masters undoubtedly crept into the athletes’ minds. For young players, it’s impossible to ignore what’s occurring in the professional ranks, but this can be helpful, not a distraction.
“That gets you in the right mindset of competition,” Cordeiro said. “When you see such great golf it inspires you to try to play to that level. I would say it was beneficial for us to watch and enjoy the Masters in the days before [our tournament]. On Saturday there’s no time to watch but leading up to it I think it’s a good thing.”
This proved to be true for Cordeiro and Fairbairn. The two sophomores both recorded team-best scores of 70 in their second and first rounds, respectively. Fairbairn also notched an impressive 71 in his second round of the day.
Overall, it was an incredible weekend for Tiger Woods and for fans of golf. The whole situation was almost a storybook return to the top that could not have been scripted much better. Tiger’s journey has, and will continue to inspire generations of young golfers who will face challenges in their own respective journeys.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to continue its excellent performance this season, the Crimson will be traveling to the historic Fenway Park on Wednesday afternoon to try and win its second straight Beanpot Championship.
Harvard (18-8, 8-4 Ivy) is taking on UMass (10-17, 5-7 A10) for the Beanpot title.
Follow our live tweets here, and read our full recap below:
@THCSports
The Minutemen started off the season to a rocky start, have turned things around since then. After beating Boston College 6-2 in the opening round of the Beanpot on April 2nd, the surging Umass team has won six of its last eight games, coming into the Beanpot final in good form.
To get into the Beanpot, Harvard beat a strong Northeastern squad 4-3, surrendering only one hit and turning the game over to the strong bullpen as senior closer Kieran Shaw brought home the win. Since then, the Crimson has been on a similar hot streak as the Minutemen, as it has taken two series 2-1 against strong Ivy League opponents, Yale and Cornell.
Harvard is led by Shaw who is second in the nation in saves with 11, a school record, and senior first baseman Patrick McColl, who is fifth in the nation in batting average, hitting a strong .443. Both lead the Ivy League in their respective categories.
“I think the key will be coming out aggressive early and trying to set the pace,” said McColl about the Crimson’s approach to the game, “Playing at Fenway can definitely cause some nerves, so trying to take an early lead will help calm those nerves.”
The key to the game for the Harvard pitchers will be to shut down a balanced UMass offense who, one through six, can put the ball in play. With a strong bullpen, Harvard hopes to jump on the Umass pitching staff early with their hot bats.
The team is led by a tight knit and hard-working ground of upperclassmen: McColl, senior outfielder Ben Skinner, junior outfielder Jake Suddleton, and junior infielder Chad Minato are all hitting above .300 and slugging above .400. It will be the difficult task of the Minutemen to slow down this potent upperclassmen offense.
For the Crimson, this game represents an opportunity to immortalize their names into the record books: never in the program’s history has Harvard won back to back Beanpot Championships. This game also is the fourth time that the Crimson have been in the Beanpot Championship in the past six years. In a year chock-full of incredible individual performances that rank on the national NCAA leaderboards, this game is a chance to break one more program record, this time as a team. The strong season so far shows the commitment and dedication of the baseball program as a whole: in the offseason, the practices, and the games.
The team is excited to play at one of the most famous parks in the sport. The players collectively anticipate the nerves that surround the game, but are prepared to go out and perform to the best of their ability. For many of the upperclassmen, their last time at Fenway was clouded with bad weather, and this game represents possibly their last chance to play in the historic ballpark.
“I’m excited to be back at Fenway, because my sophomore year the game got cut short due to rain,” said McColl on the opportunity to play at Fenway, “It doesn’t look like that will happen this year so hopefully we can defend our Beanpot title.”
All ticket proceeds from the game will go to support a great cause, the Pete Frates 3 Fund, named after a Boston College baseball captain who was diagnosed with ALS. The game is set to start 45 minutes after the consolation game between Boston College and Northeastern ends at approximately 5:00 PM.

April 16 2019. Boston has never been stronger.
Thousands of runners from every background crossed the finish line of the 123rd Boston Marathon which is held annually on Patriots Day, the third Monday of April. The sprinkle of rain towards the end of the day greeted each runner with a cooling finish to the 26.2 miles they had just conquered.
The first of eight waves of racers began at 9:30 a.m. that morning with the final wave beginning at around 11:30 a.m. Months of hard work and training were put to the test as the runners traveled through the notoriously hilly route and mixed Massachusetts weather.
The immense difficulty of the route left runners emotional as they finished the marathon. The most well known of these challenges is Newton’s Heartbreak Hill, an obstacle that runners must face deep into the race after they have already run 20 miles. The hill is a constant incline for a half-mile stretch that tests every runner. Once completed, runners began to feel the accomplishment and emotion of the marathon as they entered the final 5-mile stretch.
Thousands of people lined the sides of Boylston Street in downtown Boston to see their family and friends cross the finish line. The crowd greeted each runner with cheers, laughter, and smiles. Tears of joy filled the eyes of proud parents and loved ones and hugs were everywhere in sight.
People ran for awareness, some people ran for themselves, others ran for their families and their children, and those dedicated to the sport ran to compete.
As participants crossed the finish line, volunteers congratulated each individual, giving out high fives and hugs as they made their way to their families and friends. Volunteers were everywhere handing out waters, snacks, heat blankets, first aid, medals, and most of all smiles to every racer that passed by.
