After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BATSI, Greece—I have met dozens of strangers in the past few weeks. The man selling olives in the farmers’  market, the woman in the Syntagma metro station, the gypsy girl selling (God knows why) tissues. The man who sold me souvlaki, the man in the Orthodox church, the waiter at the restaurant where I had dinner two nights ago, the person who had stopped to stretch in the National Garden whom I asked the distance of the loop we were both running, separately. The person I asked for directions I don’t know where, the woman who tore my ticket boarding the ferry to Spetsos, the man who tore my ticket boarding the ferry back to Athens. I will never see any of these people again.
There are also the people with whom my interactions have been slightly more extended. The older couple at the table next to mine a week ago, I think they were from Delaware, who helped swat away the bee that had landed on my plate. The waiter who, when he saw me enter the restaurant and ask for a table for one, repeated “alone?” probably five times and proceeded to assume that alone meant lonely and that a free glass of white wine would be enough to convince me to go out that night with his 30-plus year old self. One Hundred Years of Solitude, which I used as my shield to his repeated attempts at conversation, was better company. The twenty-something year old and his mom, who watched my bag when I went into the ocean at Aegina, which I visited on my day off.
And then there are the unexpected repeats. Vacili, the waiter at the taverna next to my hostel, who says “Alice!” whenever I walk by (he misheard my name when we humorously introduced ourselves to each other when I had walked by the taverna enough times for the each of us to be recognizable to the other, and it didn’t seem worth it to correct him. Funnily enough Alice is one of my middle names.). Pam, from New Zealand, who likes to write and is staying at the same hostel as I and has been here for just as long. Noel, the Canadian business school student, and Erik, the archeologist from Denver, and Sarah, the ballerina from Philadelphia, and the two Finnish boys whose names I couldn’t spell if I tried and could pronounce only when I tried very hard. The staff at the hostel, the man who plays the accordion up the block, the waitress at my favorite café beside the Roman Agora.
For a month I have been alone in Greece, Athens, Mykonos and now Batsi, to be specific and only in a few isolated moments have I felt solitude to be sad. I have read many books, and I am no longer self-conscious about sitting down in a restaurant absolutely “alone?” “alone.” But what I had expected to be time exaggerated by extended silences, increasingly depressing musings, and homesickness of the first-week-of-sleep-away-camp variety has actually been filled with a series of inconsequential interactions with strangers and some interesting moments by myself.
I have thought about adopting the character of a book I had most recently read (“Hi! I’m Ursula, from a small village. You’ve definitely never heard of it. There are lots of birds there, and a while ago there was an enormous rainstorm. People don’t even know I’m alive actually.”) Or just being Sarah, from Chicago. Because it would make no difference to Noel or Pam or Vacili whether my name were Elyssa, or Sarah, or Ursula, or Alice. Each of us shares only what we want to of ourselves. Nothing rides on these interactions. They are friendships of convenience, maybe necessity. The interactions are superfluous pleasantries, or those of utility – I wanted olives and to board the ferries. But it’s still been fun. Hi, Vacili!

MUMBAI, India—Mumbai is simultaneously one of the greenest and least green cities in the world. Monsoon season means lushness—dangerously swaying palm trees dot the cracked sidewalks and overgrown plants crowd out village streets in Bandra, my neighborhood outside of the center of the city. But in terms of environmental standards, Mumbai is the opposite of green.
The city’s lushness is not what first caught my attention when I arrived in Mumbai a few weeks ago. Instead, I noticed the swerving rickshaw taxis, and the blaring horns of trucks and cars as they wove in and out of cows, children, vegetable stands, and heaps of burning trash. Traffic congestion in Mumbai has meant not only slow commuting, but an increasing number of fatalities on the road, and abysmal air-quality—by some accounts, breathing the air in Mumbai is equivalent to smoking two and a half packs of cigarettes a day. Waste disposal runs directly into the toxic sea. I have been instructed to dispose my own garbage into the massive pile that sits decaying behind a nearby bakery.
I may believe that my neighborhood is a less-than-perfect eco-system, but there is one place in Mumbai seemingly devoid of anything leafy and green: Dharavi Slum. The slum, made famous when featured in Slumdog Millionaire, is populated by upwards of 1 million people, making it the largest slum in Asia.
Dharavi sits on the edge of Mumbai’s massive railways. Homes constructed from metal scraps and tarp pile on top of each other. Children play on the towering heaps of waste behind one neighborhood of the slum. City garbage collectors are supposed to clear out this area regularly, but often they remove only minimal amounts, or do not show up at all. The smell of burning plastic and oil in the slum is overwhelming.
Recently I spent an afternoon in Dharavi as part of a site visit for the organization I am working for this summer. I accompanied three Indian women who have started an initiative in Mumbai called “Go Green Marketplaces.” They are all mothers who wear colorful printed clothing and have warm smiles. These Green Ladies of Mumbai plan to adopt different marketplaces throughout the city and turn them into plastic-free zones. They are hoping to introduce cloth bags to replace plastic bags in major stores.
When I heard about their project, I almost laughed at its absurdity. The lines between waste and the environment are blurred here to the point where it is impossible to tell where homes end and dumping grounds begin, or where sewage areas become public beaches. I tried to imagine the Dharavi women in saris toting around canvas grocery bags, like the New York City mothers I know who shop exclusively at Whole Foods.
In Dharavi, hunger trumps carbon-footprint reduction in most families’ list of priorities. Where in the world did these three Indian women come up with the idea that Mumbaikars might be interested in adopting green practices?
But that afternoon, the Green Ladies managed to unearth another layer of Dharavi. I learned that the smell of burning plastic comes from workspaces where plastic garbage (such as yogurt cups, old toys, and containers) is sorted by hand and then melted down to be reused by major companies. The smell of oil emanates from a warehouse where metal oil canisters are washed and recycled.
The slum dwellers are doing sustainability’s dirty work—it is the type of recycling that eco-conscious New York City mothers would never dream of doing. A recycling hub has emerged in one of the most unlikely place in the world, and the Green Ladies were very pleased.
Perhaps this is what the Green Ladies understood when they began their “Go Green” enterprise. Dharavi residents may not be “green,” but they are resourceful and enterprising. They may not care very much about sustainability, but they care about functionality and salvageability. And they are good at it—there is over $650 million USD annual turnover in the slum. And as of a week ago, Dharavi has become a Harvard Business School case study.
I have the Green Ladies to thank for peeling back the layers of Dharavi to reveal the environmentally friendly, vibrant life and community that resides under the surface of destitution. They helped me to notice the entrepreneurial spirit in indigence, to look past decrepit homes and see family joy, to detect the wafting smell of frying samosas among the smell of burning plastic, and to discover the greenness among the garbage.
Mumbaikars might be a long way from canvas bags, but the Green Ladies are here to help.

DAMASCUS, Syria—Damascus Airport’s main terminal has no ATM or cash machine. Its sole restaurant and Duty Free shops do not accept credit cards. For the many travelers who pass through the airport quickly and tentatively—the airport’s atmosphere is not what one could call a happy one—such facts might not be critical or even noticeable.
They can be quite important, however, if you are detained in the terminal for an extended period of time. A week before discovering the difficulties of not being able to purchase food in a confined area I could not leave, Syria decided to change its visa policy for American travelers. The reasons, my friend and I were told by apologetic and friendly Ministry of the Interior officers, were largely in retaliation for actions by the United States.
Until that decision, travelers could purchase an entrance visa right before the immigration officers, a system still available to American travelers in nations such as Turkey. Syria, however, has a curious way of sending foreign governments a message—changing its entrance rules without notifying its own embassies abroad. Ultimately, the only people who suffer are the individual tourists denied at its airport and borders—and we heard there were many others.
Over the hours we spent in pseudo-detention, we befriended the officers who appealed on our behalf but to no avail. They spoke passionately of peace and improving relations between Americans and Syrians.
Welcoming university-age students who study the region and its language and could provide informed opinions back in the U.S. about the charms of the country would seem a logical move for the Syrian government. Unfortunately, many of those potential advocates of international cooperation are instead deprived of basic dignities and their passports until they return the way they came.

BOSTON, MA-For anyone working in an office this summer, there is arguably nothing worse than to walk in and see “that guy” in the cubicle next to yours. He shows up an hour earlier than everyone else, and puts in the late-night hours even when it is completely unnecessary. He’ll likely spend more time dropping by your boss’s office than seems within reason, and will promptly seize any and all opportunities to impress the other full-time co-workers—especially all those who have the power to make job offers. Though the most eager of temp employees, they undoubtedly leave a sour taste in the mouths of their co-workers who uncomfortably witness their charades and daily dog-and-pony shows. It quickly becomes far too obvious that this guy comes to work everyday just to secure a full-time offer for the year after.
While some regard summer internships as an extended interview, to treat them purely as an opportunity for networking forgoes the otherwise valuable opportunity they provide to gain insight into a company’s inner workings and culture.  The glamorous perquisites and MD Happy Hours of the summer will only trickle to the true day-to-day monotony of a 90-hour, unforgiving, pitch-book job should one sign in the fall. And so, every second spent kissing up is one less evaluating work culture and job responsibilities so as to avoid taking a job you might ultimately find hateful. To be clear, obviously execute the tasks and projects assigned to you whole-heartedly,but remain willing to critically challenge and defy workplace convention, as a summer job is one of few opportunities to do so.
A temporary summer intern is empowered with the important mission of providing outside evaluation and judgment for the company, from a mind and eye untainted with the often immoral norms engrained into office culture. They may be wrongful business practices by management, to which the employees turn a blind eye, sexual harassment or discrimination,  or an intricate web of office politics. Among those full-time, these processes gain momentum, permeating rank and propagating over time. Any mitigation to such behavior is often quickly crushed In order to fit in, new employees, who could bring a fresh perspective the work place, are instead forced to adopt bad practices to impress management and to remain in line.
Furthermore, in most offices, institutional barriers prevent first-year hires from challenging these established office norms. When hired, the office throws new employees directly into the deep-end, forcing them to struggle to merely stay afloat. The hire’s objective is always “to catch up” and thus objections to managerial convention are efficiently skirted.. In the process of running to catch a train powering ahead at full-speed, there is never an opportunity left to ask why or where the train is even headed.
On the contrary, however, like a child, pure of office politics or moral corruption, outsiders to a firm are Corporate America’s internal whistleblowers and are supposed to provide a check to corruption and bad practices, ones accumulated with the disillusionment and cynicism of “old age” in office terms. Seasonal interns provide a firm with this rare opportunity for outside evaluation, one lost when myopic hopes of full-time offers come in the way. And so, ultimately, by pleasing a little less, we can learn a lot more.

BEIJING, China—We were standing outside of the crowded Mexican restaurant in the college district when he approached us, making a direct beeline for the only blonde in our group while ignoring the rest of us.
“Hey, brother, you seem like a chill guy,” he said in a distinctly Californian drawl, handing my friend a flyer. “I want to invite you to the party I’m throwing at my club this Saturday, right across the street. It’s going to be off the hook.”
With the swagger in his stride, the monogrammed fitted cap, and baggy blue jeans with the florescent Nikes underneath, the club promoter was a better fit for the streets of my hometown of Oakland than the Beijing boulevard where we had rendezvoused.
During the Summer Olympics hype of 2008, Beijing tried to rebrand itself as an international metropolis that could cater to the foreign crowds that had arrived en-masse for the games. Nowadays, the Bird’s Nest is empty and regular primetime TV shows have returned to the airwaves, but a part of that glorious summer’s dream still lives on in the vibrant expat population of the city.
Expat, short for expatriate, refers to the growing band of international dissenters who have flocked here to make Beijing their home while still retaining the passports of their respective motherlands. Mostly American or European, the stereotypical expat is a flaxen, middle-aged, mid-to-higher-level executive with only enough Chinese in his arsenal to direct his taxi driver. If you can speak English without a heavy accent, know a few of the right people, and have access to several English websites stationed in the capitol city, you will be able to find the niches in Beijing where this new lost generation, and the rising class of Chinese natives that want to rub elbows with them, have carved out their own separate world.
Several weekends ago, I was dining at a French restaurant where the Chinese waitresses wouldn’t even look at me till I started ordering in English instead of Mandarin. During a night out on the town, we ran into a huge guerrilla campaign pushing tickets for the upcoming Usher concert. I have seen at least four separate branches of Coach located in one region of the city alone. Pizza Hut here is the type of classy sit-down dining experience where you might take a first date. The hottest clubs in the city do not blast Jay Chou or Wang Leehom but the Black-Eyed Peas and 3OH!3.
However, the Sanlitun district still reigns as Beijing’s expat capitol. In the daytime, it is a neighborhood marked by the presence of most of the city’s embassies and consulates, but at night, the area is aglow with the neon Heineken signs of its infamous bar scene that caters specifically to expats and foreign-exchange students. During this World Cup season, a group of us Harvard students hit up sports bars in the area after work to feast on slider burgers and pizza while listening to the English commentary above the never-ceasing buzz of the vuvuzela.
Welcome to the imperial city of Beijing—I’m 9,727 miles away from home but it feels like I’ve never left.

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers reached a tentative two-year contract agreement with the University on Wednesday morning, marking the first time in the union’s 22-year history that it has not settled upon a three-year agreement.
HUCTW and Harvard decided to draw up a two-year contract as a result of differing opinions on the University’s ability to increase wages and extend benefits in subsequent years. Both parties also disagreed on whether the University’s finances are improving and will continue to improve, according to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, who could not elaborate further on the specifics of the discrepancy in opinions.
"This way we’ll come back in a year and quarter and see what’s happening with the economy, with Harvard’s endowment," Jaeger said about the decision to draft a two-year contract, which will be effective July 1. “This is a good answer, and also the right answer for this time.”
Concluding the eighth round of contract negotiations with University management, the newest contract includes a $1,000 raise for all HUCTW members this year, and a 3.5 percent salary increase for the majority of union members—significantly less than the salary increases in the 4 to 4.5 percent range outlined in the previous contract.
The new contract also increases the size of the union’s membership by granting union eligibility to non-exempt jobs in salary grade 56, or Harvard employees who earn between $49,800 and $82,000 a year—a salary grade higher than was previously covered in the contract. The change will lead to "important new career development opportunities for current Union members," according to an e-mail from HUCTW leadership to union members.
In what seems to be a reactive measure to the slew of staff cuts that swept through the University during the budget crisis last year, the new contract features strong language that seeks to ensure that the Union and the University work together to manage layoffs. Though such a measure was already in place, Jaeger said he hopes to make sure that union-management collaboration happens "earlier and more meaningfully."
“The worst of any layoff experience for our members is almost certainly behind us,” said Jaeger, in reference to the layoffs of about 100 union members last year.
The new contract expresses a commitment on behalf of the union and the University to determine when it is appropriate to hire employees for “term jobs,” positions with a designated end date that can be extended by the employer. The issue has been a source of tension between union members and the University, since employees whose jobs end on the specified date after less than two years of employment do not receive unemployment benefits.
There will be no cuts in union member’s benefits, such as health care, tuition assistance, and retirement.
Before HUCTW members will vote to ratify or reject the contract on July 22, the union says it plans to issue a statement summarizing all of the negotiated changes in the settlement. Union meetings will take place in all sectors of the University so that members can ask questions and discuss the agreement, according to the e-mail from HUCTW leaders.
HUCTW ratified its first contract with Harvard in 1989, after a protracted struggle to gain recognition from the University. Between then and 2007, the union has achieved a 145% salary increase for workers, strengthened its work-security program, and worked to preserve full health benefits for part-time employees.

On the third day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee accused the former Harvard Law School dean of withholding her personal opinions on key legal issues. 
On Wednesday, Kagan continued to defend her policies toward military recruiting during her time as dean of the Law School—an issue that faced intense scrutiny on the second day of hearings—and avoided offering judicial opinions on issues like same-sex marriage and detention of prisoners, arguing that they were matters not yet decided by the Supreme Court.
When asked what her judicial opinion would be on a case that she had considered as Solicitor General, Kagan opted to withhold her opinion in an effort to separate her decisions as Solicitor General from her potential rulings as a judge and said, “I’ve not read the petitions and I’ve not read the briefs as I would as a judge.” 
Senator Arlen Specter—a Pennsylvanian Democrat who was a Republican until last month—made clear his belief that Kagan was deliberately offering unsubstantive answers rather than being forthcoming with her opinion, and even cited a Chicago Law Review article in which Kagan criticized Supreme Court nominees for not being candid with their answers.
“Perhaps you haven’t answered much of anything," said Specter, who was one of 31 senators who voted against Kagan’s confirmation as Solicitor General last year. "It would be my hope that we could find some place between voting no and having some sort of substantive answers. But I don't know that it would be useful to pursue these questions any further.”
In an attempt to elicit a personal opinion from Kagan, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey O. Graham pointed to a 2009-2010 case in which then-Solicitor General Kagan’s office argued on behalf of the federal government that habeas corpus do not extend to detainees at the United States Air Force Base at Bagram, Afghanistan. But when Kagan was asked to make a decision on the case, were it to reach the Supreme Court, she again avoided the question.
“I don’t believe that that is a question that has come before the court,” Kagan said. “And given that I would not want to suggest how I would decide that.”
Though Kagan’s deanship at the Law School was examined with less vigor than the day before, Graham and others did raise the question of whether Kagan attempted to push a particular agenda by restricting recruiters’ access to the Law School’s career services office.
“I was simply trying to…enforce and defend the school’s very long-standing non-discrimination policy,” Kagan said. “The purpose of the policy was to express support for our students who were being discriminated against, for our gay and lesbian students who wanted to serve in the military and at the same time to ensure that our students…had excellent access to recruiters and vice-versa.”
Despite the persistent scrutinizing of Kagan’s past, some lawmakers are confident that the hearings are nearing their end and that Kagan’s confirmation is close to certain.
“I assume she will be,” Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn said of Kagan’s potential confirmation.
The probing lines of questioning were interspersed with some light-hearted banter by Graham, who preceded his inquiry about Kagan’s time at the Law School by saying that he “couldn’t even play football at Harvard University,” given his SAT scores. Kagan assured him that she would have accepted him.

Barry S. Kane, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar noted for overhauling and modernizing his division during his seven-year tenure, will step down on July 16 and move to Wellesley College to head the Registrar’s Office and assume an assistant deanship there, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday.
At the head of an office charged with coordinating the myriad moving parts of the University’s academic everyday—a busy mosaic of student records, course registrations, grades, transcripts, classroom assignments, and final examination administrations—Kane oversaw the migration of the Registrar’s systems and processes to online platforms. The move was in some ways a reprisal of a previous stint as Yale Registrar, where he used online interfaces and software to streamline academic operations before making the move to Cambridge in 2003.
"Barry transformed the Registrar’s office," said Secretary of the Administrative Board John "Jay" L. Ellison, crediting Kane with overseeing the “complete transition of the registrar duties onto the online world."
In an interview on Thursday, Kane ticked off a number of processes that moved online during his tenure: "Registration was done manually on paper in sort of an arena setting in Sever Hall, course evaluations were manually completed, class lists were paper, grading was paper," he said. "The world has changed."
Hammonds’ e-mail, addressed to "FAS Colleagues," cited Kane’s role in developing the online system and lauded him as well for directing two major reorganizations of his division—giving a greater role to the Information Technology team early in his tenure and later, in the midst of the historic economic crisis that winded the University in the 2009, adjusting to "align the office with new financial realities."
Kane did not command a highly visible presence on campus—a fact very much in keeping with his own conception of the Registrar’s role and profile, which he outlined in a rare, early interview with The Crimson in 2003.
"Our job is to fit into the background," he said then. "Students shouldn’t have to think about the registrar too much. After all, how many students can remember the name of their registrar after they graduate? But I bet they can remember the names of the professors who most influenced their lives."
For many, Kane was a disembodied voice, often exhorting the student body via e-mail to rally to such tasks as the completion of the semesterly course evaluations—known as C.U.E.s and later Q’s—whose online administration fell under his office’s purview.
In one representative spate of correspondence, over the course of two days in 2007, Kane sent three e-mails imploring students to fill out the C.U.E. evaluations, dangling a $10,000 reward for the undergraduate House whose students mustered the highest level of participation. At the end of the following spring, Kane launched a similar campaign, signing his name to e-mails entitled "The Q is now open," "Please, do the Q now," "Final Days to Evaluate Your Courses," and "Six Hours Left to Evaluate Your Courses."
"For those of you who tend to wait until the last minute to attend to responsibilities, that last minute is now fast approaching," Kane wrote in one e-mail to students. "For yourself, for your professors, for your teaching fellows, and for your fellow students, take the time now before the spring term begins to complete your course evaluations. Nothing could be more important to teaching within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences."
In an interview on Thursday, Kane said that he believes the changes he made to course evaluations had been his most significant accomplishment at Harvard. Before Kane arrived at the University, course evaluations were optional for professors, generally took place during the last class of the year, and were filled out by hand.
Kane’s work ethic and dedication to the position will be missed, colleagues and administrators said.
"Barry is a consummate professional, very dedicated to his work, exacting and demanding as a registrar must be," Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an e-mail from Jerusalem. "I have found him a pleasure to work with, even when we did not see eye to eye, as sometimes happened."
College administrators learned about the decision Monday, according to Ellison, who said Kane was leaving because he was "looking for new experiences and new challenges."
"It’s been seven years. Don’t you think that’s been long enough?" Kane said. "I’ll also say that Harvard has been fabulous probably the best professional experience of my life."
But Kane, who has occupied posts at Yale, Colgate, and Drew Universities prior to his work at Harvard, said he is ready for new challenges.
It remains unclear when the College will select a replacement or who will fill Kane's position in the interim. But, Kane said, work remains for his replacement: his biggest regret is not implementing an electronic platform for professors to submit midterm grades to the College.
Kane will leave behind what some called a time-consuming and sometimes thankless position.
"Registrar is one of those positions where everybody thinks of the registrar as a nuisance, if they think about them at all, until something goes wrong," said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68, who called Kane’s departure "a huge loss for Harvard."

University President Drew G. Faust declared global universities the new engine for the world economy—particularly during a time when other institutions "falter in dispiriting succession," she said, hinting at the great number of failed financial firms.
In a speech to the Royal Irish Academy at Trinity College in Dublin on Wednesday, Faust cited U.S. statistics that showed a 24 percent increase in the number of people who believed education to be "absolutely necessary" from 2000 to 2009—a fact, she said, corroborated by 2002 U.S. Census Bureau statistics showing that college-educated Americans earn about twice over their lifetime than citizens with just a secondary education.
"Prevailing discourse, familiar since at least the 1990s, emphasizes the university's place as a paramount player in a global system increasingly driven by knowledge, information and ideas," Faust said. "We live in a time when knowledge is ever more vital to our societies and economies."
But Faust also highlighted several potential deterrents that might threaten this knowledge-fueled economy: the global economic recession, the unilateral focus on the sciences, and the current security and competitive notions that deter immigrants to study in the United States.
Noting that the financial crisis left many universities struggling to support all of their educational operations, Faust identified this "paradox" as a direct threat to the "knowledge economy."
"While the knowledge economy drives and indeed requires the unprecedented growth of higher education, in many places university budgets decline, and courses, faculty and opportunities are cut back, even as enrollments and expectations rise," Faust said.
But Faust went further, saying that she was afraid that in some universities, these cuts were beginning to target disciplines that did not fall under science, technology, engineering, and math—a trend, if globally realized, that could "distort our understanding of all that universities should and must be."
"When we define higher education's role principally as driving economic development and solving society's most urgent problems, we risk losing sight of broader questions, of the kinds of inquiry that enable the critical stance, that build the humane perspective," Faust said.
In this effort to expand universities' inclusion of disciplines and voices, Faust also cautioned against stricter immigration laws, saying that "talent comes with many passports." She discussed how these strict immigration policies, born out of local "fears of economic competition," led to the detainment of Eric Balderas '13, an undocumented youth who gained national attention last month when he faced possible deportation to Mexico.
Though she recognizes that these stricter measures built upon strong security initiatives to keep immigrants out of the country after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Faust said that these additional bans affect faculty and student alike.
"The numbers of international students at Harvard and across the United States have now returned to earlier levels, but security concerns continue to inhibit ease of movement for many who wish to cross borders to study or to undertake research collaborations," she said.
Faust spoke at the Royal Irish Academy as a part of Academy President Nicholas P. Canny’s discussion about the place of the university in a changing and developing world."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An alleged cocaine dealer was arrested on Monday within 1,000 feet of the King Open Elementary School and charged with cocaine trafficking and drug violation near a school or park, the Cambridge Police Department announced.
 
The arrest of Jeffery Appolon—which took place around 7:30 p.m. near the rear of the Roosevelt Towers—came on the heels of recent complaints of drug activity, and tip-offs from Cambridge citizens that an individual with a large amount of cocaine would be in the area, according to a CPD press release.
 
“We are very proud that a known drug dealer and a large amount of cocaine were removed from Cambridge city streets,” said Police Commissioner Robert C. Hass in the release. 
 
While conducting surveillance, detectives of the Special Investigation Unit found approximately 50 grams of cocaine hidden in the waistband of Appolon’s pants. In addition, officers found a digital scale disguised as a CD case and a Pringles potato chip container with a concealed compartment.
 
Sergeant Robert W. Grey, a member of the Cambridge Police Special Investigation Unit, emphasized the importance of anonymous tips from the community to yield arrests like Monday’s.
 
From the 13 Neighborhood’s in Cambridge, the neighboring areas in north eastern Cambridge-Agassiz, Mid-Cambridge, Inman/Harrington, and Area 4-have shown high—and, in most cases, increasing—number of drug incidents. Most of the remaining neighborhoods have shown decreases—and sometimes no—drug incidents over the past three years. 
 
"Cambridge is a big city and it has the assorted drug problems that any city would have," Grey said. "[The drug dealers] are trying to fit into the neighbourhood....It’s very hard to infiltrate these groups."
