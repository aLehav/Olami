After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Cambridge zoning board will consider a bid this week to replace Harvard Square’s family-run newsstand and gift shop Crimson Corner with Washington, D.C.-based eatery 
&pizza.
The pizza chain has applied to renovate and combine the Crimson Corner space and adjacent Tory Row, which closed in October. The Board of Zoning Appeal will discuss architectural plan at its next public meeting on Jan. 12.
If approved, 
&pizza, which specializes in individual made-to-order pizza pies, would join a myriad of pizza shops in the square, including Pinocchio's, Otto, The Just Crust, and Cambridge, 1.
Meanwhile, Crimson Corner, located at the intersection of Brattle St., JFK St., and Massachusetts Ave., would shutter at the end of the month after 54 years in the Square.
Crimson Corner owner Chris Kotelly said he has been looking for a new location in the Square after the store lost its lease earlier this month. He added that he hopes Cantabrigians’ resistance to chain restaurants will keep the newsstand at its current location.
“There was a lot of public outcry against our newsstand leaving and the pizza shop coming in, so I think that is kind of building momentum for us. Whether that keeps us here or not, I’m not sure,” Kotelly said.
The news comes at a time of heavy construction and rapid turnover in Harvard Square. Multiple businesses have closed in recent years, and the future of other local mainstays—including the Curious George store at the corner of Brattle St. and JFK St.—remains in limbo.
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, says she is helping Kotelly find a location for Crimson Corner to relocate, but the search has so far been unsuccessful.
“We’re looking in the Harvard Square area for a retail spot,” Kotelly said. “We just haven’t found anything that’s feasible.”
Jillson added that she values having local businesses operate in the Square.
“The fact that Crimson Corner is a locally-owned independent is really important to us, but all businesses are important to us because they all bring something,” said Jillson.
Michael Lastoria, the founder and chief executive of &pizza, said he is excited at the possibility of &pizza coming to the Boston area.
“We love Boston and know &pizza will fit right in. As soon as we have more news to share, you can expect us to be shouting it from the rooftops,” Lastoria wrote in an emailed statement.

Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 will serve as the College’s next BGLTQ Student Life director, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in an email Tuesday.
Scarborough, currently the assistant director of student services at Harvard Summer School, has acted as interim director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life since August, following the departure of previous director Van Bailey for the University of Miami in July. Bailey was the first director of the the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, which the College opened in 2012.
“I think that it was a real affirmation to receive the position, an affirmation that I have what the College wants and needs right now,” Scarborough said. “I think that [the BGLTQ Office has] so much potential. There’s so much that we can do over the next few years and I’m so glad to be able to continue that work.”
Scarborough, who holds degrees from both the College and the Divinity School, said he thinks his time as interim director prepared him well for the new position, adding he is “ready to hit the ground running.”
Looking ahead, Scarborough said his top two priorities are ensuring BGLTQ students who have yet to come out feel welcome at the BGLTQ Office and creating a “more visible presence” for the Office in students’ residential lives.
He said he sees both issues as “big needs,” and areas where the College must do better.
Scarborough said his own experience coming out as a senior at the College will inform his work as the BGLTQ office’s director.
He said he wants to work with “students who aren’t out and who may not feel like the BGLTQ Office or BGLTQ student life may be for them—students who maybe are going through the same things that I went through as an undergrad.”
Scarborough said he aims to welcome these students by offering “expertise” and “compassion,” and by helping connect them with peers “feeling the same thing.” He also intends to improve relations between the Office and BGLTQ tutors and proctors stationed in the undergraduate Houses; he said the current relationship is “disconnected.”
“We want to see how we can be a part of that in supporting students where they live, not just where we exist as an office,” he said.
Scarborough said he has yet to make any definite plans for his office and wants to move forward “carefully and thoughtfully.” He has, however, proposed to recreate “Faith and Sexuality Initiative,” a group he co-founded at the Divinity School that gathered students together to discuss religion and sexuality.
Scarborough hopes the club, which he plans to form in the next two years, will help members explore their religious and BGLTQ identities. He said he will invite campus religious groups to participate in these conversations.
Patric C. W. Verrone ’18, who interns in the BGLTQ Office, said he was “very glad” that Scarborough will be the next permanent director. He said he was pleased with Scarborough’s work as interim director, and that Scarborough’s decision-making capabilities fit him well for the new role.
“From the perspective of an intern, he’s just been very mindful and respectful and just a great person to work with,” Verrone said. “Among the staff, we all love him.”
Though excited to start work, Scarborough said the United States’s current political landscape poses challenges he “might not have anticipated” prior to November’s presidential election. As an example, he referenced the recent wave of proposed “bathroom bills,” legislation decreeing that transgender people must use bathrooms corresponding to their sex assigned at birth.
“We have to be ‘anxious and jealous guardians’ of… the rights and privileges that we have been able to accomplish and gain over the past few years with BGLTQ rights,” he said, alluding to remarks President Obama made in his farewell address Tuesday.
Scarborough will officially assume his new position on Feb. 6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard Law School alumni and officials are confident that the school’s fundraising success will continue “unabated” after Law School Dean Martha L. Minow steps down at the end of the academic year, building on momentum that has already carried the school past its capital campaign goal of $305 million.
When Minow announced last week that she plans to return to teaching full time at the end of the academic year, she also said the school has surpassed its fundraising goal. Publicly launched in October 2015, the Law School’s ongoing capital campaign is more modest than the school’s last campaign, which set a $400 million goal and ultimately raised $476 million. The campaign seeks to raise funds for financial aid, legal clinics, and recruiting and maintaining faculty.
In an email, Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean for alumni affairs and development, declined to disclose the exact amount the Law School has raised in its campaign so far. He said the school “will not be setting a new goal but will continue to raise money for our ongoing campaign priorities.”
Deans often play a leading role courting donors and traveling to raise money for capital campaigns: When David T. Ellwood ’75 stepped down as the dean of the Kennedy School of Government in 2015, for example, he said he expected fundraising to slow down. But some Law School donors and alumni said they do not think that Minow’s departure will hinder the ongoing capital campaign and that the next dean will continue to fundraise successfully.
Lynn A. Savarese, a Law School alumnus and a former chair of the school’s Annual Fund, said in an email that she doesn’t think Minow’s departure will slow down fundraising efforts over the remainder of the campaign.
“Over the course of her tenure, Dean Minow has re-engaged alumni and generated tremendous good will and excitement within the alumni community, which will no doubt carry over and be helpful to her successor,” Savarese wrote.
Law school alumnus Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, who writes legal analyses for the New Yorker and CNN, said that while Minow’s reputation as a major figure in American law helps fundraising efforts, the dean is not the only factor that drives donations. He said he expects the next dean will also be a leading legal mind.
“I think alums want a dean that reflects well on the school. I anticipate that the next dean will be well regarded,” Toobin said. “By and large alums are loyal to the institution, more than they are giving to the current dean, but the fact that she is so well-regarded is certainly a major plus.”
Robb London, a Law School spokesperson and assistant dean, wrote in an email that the school expects continued fundraising success despite Minow’s departure before the end of the campaign.
“We are well-positioned to continue that success during the transition to a new deanship and during the celebration of our Bicentennial year,” London wrote.
Toobin credited Minow with leading a successful fundraising drive despite the economic turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis.
“I think she has done a heroic job, because she came as the economy was collapsing and she had to maintain the standards of the school in very difficulty financial circumstances and while being a major voice for progressive legal education and progressive politics in the country at large,” Toobin said.
Law school alumnus Peter L. Malkin ’55 said the results of the campaign were a wonderful surprise, and that he thinks Minow’s departure might inspire special fundraising efforts.
“I think that the fundraising will continue unabated and I hope that some special fundraising might be done in honor of Dean Minow,” Malkin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started with a free throw. Then came another. Then came a three pointer and before long Harvard had erased what matched its lowest scoring first half this season against a visiting McGill squad.
After shooting 35 percent from the field and going 0-of-6 from deep in that first frame, the Crimson (8-5, 1-0 Ivy League) began the second period on a 13-3 run, building a lead they wouldn’t give up en route to a 70-45 win over McGill (12-8) at Lavietes Pavilion on Tuesday.
Coming off a matchup against Dartmouth where Harvard’s depth was the key to a win, Tuesday’s victory was a lot of the same—in total 11 Crimson players saw the floor, with eight scoring 5 or more and only freshman guard Justin Bassey playing over thirty minutes.
“We really tried to stay true to our identity of playing team defense and I think we really picked that up in the second half,” junior forward Chris Egi said. “I think we got into a rhythm defensively.”
What ended as a runaway Harvard win, however, began as a close matchup. With both teams turning the ball over eight times in the first half alone and with McGill dominating the offensive glass, the Crimson struggled to hold a lead early.
In the first frame, McGill outrebounded Harvard 21 to 17 and 8 to 4 on the offensive end. Despite poor first half shooting, the difference for the Crimson came at the line. While McGill struggled, going 5-of-10 at the line through the first frame, Harvard converted on 9-of-12 at the charity stripe.
“We want to pressure the basketball, we need to see that we can speed up our opponent when they’re not in rhythm on the offensive end, make them do things that they’re not comfortable doing,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “All these things that we’re talking about needs to be done without fouling and that’s hard.”
While McGill and the Crimson would trade the lead four times, Harvard closed the half on a high note. After retaking the lead off a layup from freshman Henry Welsh assisted by sophomore Corey Johnson, Bassey would go to the line twice and convert on all four to end the half on a 6-2 run, giving the Crimson a lead they would only build on in the next frame.
“They were great in the first half, but they’re a good team,” Amaker said. “This is a good basketball team and program. I just think our bench and our balance again becomes the difference for us.”
In the second half the Harvard offense came out shooting. After starting the second frame on a 13-3 run, the Crimson kept rolling, with Johnson leading the way for Harvard. After totaling only two points in the first half on 0-of-4 shooting from the field, Johnson went off for 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting from the field and 3-of-4 from deep. He led all scorers with 15 points and added a team high five assists.
Despite the strong shooting from Johnson, McGill made a dent at Harvard’s lead midway through the second. The Canadian squad went down by as much as 13 early in the second half, but went on a 7-2 run to close the gap to eight with just over 13 minutes left on the clock. Harvard responded quickly, however, putting up nine points and forcing two turnovers in a span of two minutes to put the game out of reach.
After turning over the ball 8 times the first half, the Crimson turned things around and protected the ball in the second, turning it over only twice while forcing 12 turnovers from McGill. On the game the Harvard would total 21 points off turnovers to McGill’s five.
“I think there are a lot of things we can pull from this, most importantly our defensive effort in the second half was outstanding,” Amaker said. “You could see how hard we played and rotated and kept fresh bodies out there and our kids were giving multiple efforts on the same possession, it was really, really neat to see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: January 11, 2016, at 2:00 p.m.
Playing a hockey game in a baseball stadium is unusual. Playing a hockey game in a baseball stadium while it is pouring rain is almost unheard of.
But that is exactly what happened on Tuesday night as the Harvard women’s hockey team (1-11-2, 1-7-2 ECAC) faced off against No. 6/6 Boston College (14-3-4, 11-2-2) in the Frozen Fenway series at Fenway Park. With many players hailing from the Boston area, playing hockey at Fenway is something that has only been a distant fantasy until this year.
“Coming from Boston, it’s one of those things that’s on you bucket list that you want to do,” junior Lexie Laing said. “I was thinking during the game even playing in the rain is something that’s on your bucket list, but you don’t realize it until you experience it, so for me it was pretty cool.”
In a waterlogged game where the puck moved slow and the ice was slippery, the Eagles clinched a 3-1 victory over the Crimson with two goals coming from the stick of freshman Erin Connolly.
Coming into the game Harvard had been on a on a slide where it had not won a game since Oct. 23. Six out of its past 10 games were forced into an extra frame, leaving the Crimson on the cusp of victory many times before.
On the other side of the puck, BC went 10-1-2 over that same span with a record of 6-0-2 in the eight games leading up to Frozen Fenway. The last time these two teams met, the Eagles lit Harvard up for eight goals while giving up none and shutting out the Crimson 8-0 in the opening round of the 2016 Beanpot.
This game went a little differently from the beginning. Harvard came roaring out of the starting gate and controlled the puck in the BC zone for the opening two minutes of the contest. The Crimson was able to hold the Eagles scoreless through the first period of play and almost halfway through the second frame before the scoring started.

Boston College broke the silence at the 9:45 mark of the second period when senior Andia Anastos fed a pass to freshman Bridget McCarthy who found a hole in front of Laing. The Eagles struck again within the next five minutes of play when Connolly was again fed from Anastos and caught Laing in transition, hitting the puck home in the corner of the net. Connolly would score again in the third period on an unassisted shot.
As time elapsed and the conditions started to worsen on the ice, Harvard head coach Katie Stone had one message to her players; keep it simple.
“When you’re playing outside, whether it’s raining, whether it’s snowing, you’ve got to simplify your game,” Stone said. “When we did that I think we had a lot of success. When we started to over-handle things a little bit and tried to make something that wasn’t there, that’s when things get a little scattered.”
The Crimson was able to pull together a scoring effort late in the third period and ruin BC goalie Katie Burt’s shutout when freshman Kat Hughes punched in a pass from Bradley Fusco that found the back of the Eagle goal.
In the final two minutes of play, Harvard pulled Laing out of the goal in an attempt to erase the divide in the score, but it was to no avail.
“BC is a really good team, and they have some really good players but we’ve had some success against them,” Stone said. “We’re in a rebuilding mode, and they’re still in a pretty strong place in their program. Things go in cycles.”
A lot of legends have been honored at Fenway, and Tuesday night’s legend in residence was Denna Laing, older sister of the Crimson’s Laing sisters, who played hockey at Princeton before going on to play in the inaugural season of the National Women’s Hockey League for the Boston Pride. Denna was a promising star to guide the NWHL’s debut into the sporting world, but an accident in her first outdoor game left Denna with an injury that would end her hockey career.
The entire Harvard team honored Denna during Tuesday night’s game by wearing ‘14’ patches on the shoulders of their uniform, and Denna dropped the ceremonial first puck before the game.
Integrating women’s hockey into the Frozen Fenway series also included high school girls hockey as well as a clinic provided by the Boston Pride before the game.
“I think as a player who’s riding the wave of women’s hockey coming to the forefront, it’s awesome,” senior Sydney Daniels said. “You get the sense of recognition now that growing up, the players above us didn’t have. Going to games and having the younger players look up to you and aspire to be in the shoes that you’re in, it just makes the position you’re in feel that much more of a privilege.”
