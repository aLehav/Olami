After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disputed romance, political discourse, rousing speeches, ostracized individuals just trying to gain acceptance... On paper, these elements promise great potential for an inspiring, powerful film. However, in the case of “A United Kingdom,” directed by Amma Asante, such dramatic structures are thrown together with what seems to be a formulaic and all too familiar recipe.
The movie is based on a true story about the romance between Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo), the prince-turned-king of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), and Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike), an English typist. Set in the late 1940’s, the story follows Seretse and Ruth as they overcome stereotypical conflicts of social dramas. Jack Davenport plays Alistair Canning, the British representative to Southern Africa and a plot device who makes it his mission to prevent Seretse and Ruth from being together, supposedly to avoid chaos in Southern Africa.
One of the first apparent issues with the film is that it attempts to be both a political drama and a love story, without allowing either concept to be fully established. Seretse and Ruth’s budding romance is hastily developed, and within the first 10 minutes the two are already infatuated with each other. They go on a date, and then a montage shows that they go on many more, but the audience is not privy to the details of those interactions. By the time Seretse asks Ruth to marry him, the rushed romance has barely been established. This is particularly problematic as the rest of the film hinges on the strength of their relationship.
Seretse must then return to Bechuanaland to fill his role as king. The British government, fearing conflict between Bechuanaland and South Africa due to the South African apartheid policy, send Alistair Canning to attempt to prevent the marriage. Additionally, both Ruth and Seretse get backlash from their own families. With all of this opposition, it almost seems ridiculous when both Ruth and Seretse persist and continue to proclaim their love for each other, as their relationship on-screen has hardly been developed to that point of commitment.
The rest of the film follows a predictable formula. Ruth is initially met with disapproval and even scorn by the people of Bechuanaland, making it her goal to win their trust and respect. Seretse fights against the condescension of Canning while trying to gain permission to become the rightful king of his country. By giving its characters stereotypical obstacles, the movie fails to develop its main characters into unique and memorable individuals. The resulting product is a film that incorporates just the superficial elements of a great drama.
One bright spot in the movie is Oyelowo’s performance as Khama. His acting goes beyond the depth that the plot and dialogue offer. When Seretse delivers a passionate speech to his people, he cries, “I love my wife!”, a fact that might not be entirely obvious if not for Oyelowo’s delivery and emotion. However, the movie relies too much on Oyelowo’s acting, and he can only carry the film so far.
As a whole, “A United Kingdom” is passable. Its dialogue is not utterly bland, the acting is strong for the most part, and in the end it is a remarkable story that actually occurred in history. However, in order to tell this story, the filmmakers resorted to cliches, creating a movie that tries so hard to be multi-dimensional that it turns out as flat as they come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Get Out” starts with a classic problem—meeting the parents. But in this rendition, the largest problem for a happy, interracial couple quickly shifts away from not being able to start a conversation with the father to something much more tense. The boyfriend, an African-American man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), grows concerned that he may be walking into hostile territory as his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), takes him to a whitewashed environment set at an estate in the woods. As soon as the couple reaches the home, it gets increasingly clear that there is something off.
The movie is full of overpowering twinge of racism, one example blatantly observed as Rose’s father points out the fact that they are an affluent white family with an African-American maid and groundskeeper. This is followed by more metaphorical suggestions throughout the movie, often drawing on the power of visual language, as images of racism become an underlying theme in the movie—Chris himself is a photographer, stressing the importance of imagery even further. The angles and compositions match the undertone of their scenes. For example, when the couple first drive up to the home, all seems to be going well, and the audience gets a simple view of the property; however, when Chris is overwhelmed by an impromptu hypnosis session with Rose’s psychiatrist mother, a nightmarish vibe consumes the screen.
The artistic camerawork blends into the music and mannerisms of the characters, who try to reassure that everything is in order while simultaneously betraying, through tilted smile and wide-open eyes, a feeling that can only be described as creepy. Everyone unsettlingly slips into their role like a piece to a grandfather clock. The only ones that seem to be concerned are Chris and Rose. Scenes that seem normal to the white characters (except Rose) are uncomfortable and especially disturbing to Chris. For example, when a party of the parents’ friends is held, a woman blatantly grabs Chris’ arm and stares in awe at his physique in a degrading way.
Only one other character fully catches on to the peculiarity, but doesn’t come in contact with the couple for most of the movie. Rob, a friend of Chris’, gets to hear about snippets of odd events, but from miles away through the security of a cell phone. He still manages to have quite the presence, providing lines of humor to break the unnerving images of the movie. These comments add more of a rhythm to the movie as fear is shattered by a witty joke and then gradually resurfaces. His conversations with Chris are also comforting in a way, suggesting that Chris is fully aware of the weird clockwork characters and their actions around him.
“Get Out” is certainly a refreshing twist on movies that address racism. The panel of white actors and actresses separate themselves from Chris, but not in the stereotypical way. He is not looked down upon, but rather is insulted by being observed and admired as some sort of trophy. Even the other African-American characters at the estate—the maid and the groundskeeper—detach themselves from Chris. The only person that manages to treat him like a normal person is Rose. What about him causes such an eerie effect of delight on the people of the estate? Is it solely his race, or is there more to it? The answer is one that might send a wave of chills down the audience’s spine.

In the wake of Harvard College's recent announcement that it had, for the third time in a row, set a record for the number of applications received, we urge the College to accept a class that is reflective of the size and diversity of this applicant pool. Admissions officers should prioritize the creation of an educational experience involving a multitude of perspectives.
Harvard’s new applicant pool represents an increased interest in fields such as the humanities, computer science, and theater, but it more importantly shows the promise of increased representation of minority students. The number of Asian American, Latino, African American, Native American, and Native Hawaiian applicants has increased since last year’s application term. The number of women applying to the College has also increased by 2.5 percent. While the College continues to accept a record-low proportion of applicants, the decrease in Harvard’s admissions rate speaks to the reduced barriers in applying to this institution rather than its exclusivity.
We commend Harvard’s outreach efforts to students of low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds in recent years and encourage the Admissions Office to continue their efforts. First established in 2004, Harvard Financial Aid Initiative has made notable strides in making Harvard affordable for families from all rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Currently, if a family earns less than $65,000 per year, the parents pay nothing towards Harvard’s tuition. The newly announced “start-up” grant, which provides $2,000 to incoming freshmen of such backgrounds, has aided the transition for about one in five freshmen in the Class of 2020. Similarly, the Admissions Office’s Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program annually spreads awareness about the Harvard experience to minority middle and high school students across the country. Harvard’s dedication to reducing economic and social barriers has made an impact on prospective applicants as it continues to open up its gates to a wider range of students than ever before.
In addition to the College’s efforts to recruit students from a variety of socioeconomic and minority backgrounds, Harvard’s continued commitment to accepting international and undocumented students is also commendable, especially considering the current political climate. President Donald Trump’s recent immigration ban and his harsh stance against undocumented immigrants has already prompted unrest from students on campus, and administrators have continued to respond to these pressing situations. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 added to this support when he formally acknowledged the Admissions Office’s pursuit of exceptional students regardless of citizenship status. The College’s continued acceptance of such students in this application cycle despite the current administration’s stance on these issues demonstrates Harvard's dedication to opening its gates to a true diversity of backgrounds.
It is not enough, however, to simply have a diverse applicant pool if the College does not take the next steps to translate its rich source of talent into a diverse Class of 2021. We hope to see the College’s efforts to recruit a wider range of applicants manifest itself once acceptances are released at the end of this application cycle. The Harvard experience thrives on diversity of thought, identity, and experiences. The College must continue to enrich this experience in the coming years.

Something potentially as important as the Democratic and Republican primaries is occurring tomorrow and it’s not receiving nearly as much attention as it should. Tomorrow, Democrats will elect a new leader for their party. Their decision matters.  The Democratic National Committee Chair decides how the party should spend its resources and what image it should brand itself with. It works to fundraise for races across the country and to connect grassroots organizers with the greater party. Currently, Donna Brazile holds the position temporarily after the July resignation of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.
Democrats have the choice between two very different paths. Keith Ellison is a lifelong community activist who is supported by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, with endorsements from Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Chuck Schumer. His opponent is the Democratic establishment candidate Tom Perez, who has the backing of Joe Biden and other Obama administration politicians.
As a moderate, I naturally wouldn’t care about internal party issues like this race. But as someone who has had Ellison as my U.S. Representative for the last 10 years of my life, I feel obligated to express my belief that Ellison is the only candidate that can restore the DNC and bring back a sense of political legitimacy in a time when many people feel lost in today’s big data, mass fundraising, and divisive politics.
Ellison does this by being humble, visible, and available to his district at a level that is far out of the norm for politicians. Ellison speaks at my high school and other public schools in my district at least once per year. He engages in Twitter conversations with his constituents over issues like Black Lives Matter protests, challenging people on both sides to find common ground. This local involvement translates into high support. In his last election, Ellison beat the Republican challenger by an unheard of 47 point margin.  He does all this while garnering national recognition in Congress where he is a member of over 20 caucuses.  He is also the founding member of the Consumer Justice Caucus, which tasks itself with listening and responding to the economic concerns of ordinary Americans.
Meanwhile Perez, reigning from New York, is the classic political insider. Obama’s former Secretary of Labor, Perez built his career as a federal prosecutor and civil rights attorney. You might also remember him as a potential Hillary Clinton Vice President pick. Never popular but always well-connected, the highest position Perez has ever been elected by the people to was County Councilman in Maryland’s Montgomery County. And although Perez spent much of his career in Maryland working as the State Secretary of Labor, Ellison was the candidate endorsed by a majority of the Baltimore City Council to be the next DNC Chair.
As the DNC Chair, Ellison would bring fresh ideas from a part of the country where Democrats have recently lost much ground. Besides Minnesota, the only Midwestern state to vote Democratic in the 2016 Presidential Election was Illinois, the home state of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Ellison and other Minnesota Democrats deserve respect for keeping Minnesota blue and are best prepared to win back voters in Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and across the country.
In this time of change, Democrats need to embrace a post-coastalist leadership search  that looks beyond Perez’s connections to Washington elites and seeks out ideas from politicians across the country. I am confident that Ellison will unite the Democratic party―not just its current factions, but also the large number of Americans who lost hope in the party after the last election cycle. If party members vote against Ellison tomorrow, it’ll be a sign that they want to pursue the same strategy that lost them the 2016 election. For these reasons, I hope you will support Ellison in this important moment for both Democrats and Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Dimetrodon milleri lurks in the Harvard Museum of Natural History’s Romer Hall, the museum’s vertebrate paleontology room. About six feet long from tail tip to snout, the dimetrodon resembles a large lizard with a flared ridge “sail” down its spine and an obstinate blunt snout, like a cross between a dog’s and a crocodile’s. The Dimetrodon display’s interactive screen presents a trivia question: To which is the dimetrodon most closely related—dinosaur, chicken, lizard, or human?
The HMNH features bright hallways of animals taxidermied and fossilized, extant and extinct. Hummingbirds float in neatly pinned columns. South American armadillos rear twelve feet into the air. Crustaceans glow in the buttery distortion of preservative jars. Soft-bodied sea creatures, impossible to naturally preserve, attain immortality as glass recreations by the Blaschkas, the father-son duo also responsible for the museum’s acclaimed glass flower collection. In a room dedicated to geology, white shelves offset the glittering fractal palettes of rock specimens.
The museum’s physical artifacts literalize metaphors and freshen worn sentiments—we leave them more viscerally aware. The otherness of specimens sharpens estrangement and apartness; we can know more about the complete trajectory of a species that died millions of years ago than we can about humans. We will not, after all, be around to document our own demise. The vast time scales highlight ephemerality: tales of rise and fall, so often told about human empire, are immediate and unforgettable when expressed as twelve-foot-tall creatures, once terrors of land and ocean, stagnating behind thin panes of glass. To some degree we love museums not only for the novelty of the differences between us and these other creatures, but also for what these differences can reveal about us.
Despite its alien anatomy and its display grouping with the triceratops, velociraptor, and kronosaur, the dimetrodon is actually our proto-mammalian ancestor. (Humans and the dimetrodon are both synapsids, while dinosaurs, chickens, and lizards are sauropsids; these two groups branched around 320 million years ago.) The species went extinct in an event known as the Great Dying, which wiped out 70 percent of terrestrial vertebrates and 96 percent of marine species at the end of the Permian some 251 million years ago. Hypotheses for causes of the Great Dying include meteor collision, widespread volcanism, and climate change, intensified by a positive feedback loop in the biosphere, atmosphere, and ocean that eventually released massive quantities of methane from the seafloor and warmed the planet beyond habitable levels.
The Great Dying is one of the Big Five mass extinction events in Earth’s history. We are now undergoing the Sixth Extinction, an anthropogenic one. In 2014, Elizabeth Kolbert’s “The Sixth Extinction,” aggregating extinction predictions, reported that “One-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward extinction.” The World Wildlife Fund recently predicted that, at our current rate, 67% of wild animal populations alive in 1970 could be extinct by 2020. Beyond certain quantities, the numbers start to become senseless. We cannot visualize all of the pandas, polar bears, black rhinos, African elephants, Panamanian frogs, tigers, hammerhead sharks, gorillas, penguins, river dolphins, tuna, spider monkeys, bats—spinning too quickly through the Rolodex of pamphlet covers, the poignant faces become a futile blur.
Travesty though it is, the main point is not that these precious animals will be gone. It is that, at such scales of damage, we are no different, not so exempt from natural law as the glass between us and the Dimetrodon may suggest.
At the end of the 19th century, the cyclical El Niño-Southern Oscillation caused widespread drought and famine across swathes of Brazil, Africa, India, Russia, and Asia. Unrest racked the affected regions. The natural disasters killed a staggering 32 to 61 million people across what we now think of as the Third World, a death toll that historian Mike Davis argues was severely exacerbated by the Western world’s response, or lack thereof, to the devastation natural forces initiated. Davis’s book includes photographs of famine victims as “accusation, not illustrations,” faces stretched taut above skeletal bodies.
There are ghostly echoes today to the Great Dying, and to the 19th-century carnage that Davis calls the Late Victorian Holocaust. Accelerated ocean warming unpredictably destabilizes circulation and weather patterns. Heat waves roll across India. Droughts precipitate bloody conflicts. The first generation of climate refugees seek shelter—not just from distant places we bracket off as developing, but from as close as an island off the coast of Louisiana. Our faces are in the catalog next to the Dimetrodon’s, separated by a handful of genealogical branches and a few blips in global cycles.
Unlike the Dimetrodon, however, we have hope. We can learn, innovate and, most importantly, cooperate. Most of our contributions will, realistically, be microscopic—but we do have a choice. Read about climate policy. Donate to support good work. Talk to people; listen to people. We inherit all the millennia that led to the existence of places like the Museum of Natural History, all the love and curiosity that drives us to reassemble the past and worry about the future. Individual actions feel meaningless, but in aggregate we shape the world. This has been the problem, and can also be the solution. I, at least, am not resigned to leaving the planet in great exhalations of methane. Two hundred and fifty million years is a long, long time to wait.

To the Editor:
I have no doubt that Mr. Cullen speaks for many Americans in wishing that the words "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddle masses" had never made it anywhere near the Statue of Liberty. That being said, he might have mentioned the immediate and severe legal challenges President Trump's executive order has faced from the federal judiciary, which has thus far struck down his all-advised, slapdash, and transparently heartless first go at "making America safe again." I do hope that Mr. Cullen makes it to Puerto Rico sometime, although I still have no idea how that relates to his argument.

The moa—a large, flightless bird native to New Zealand—has been extinct since the 14th century. But thanks to an art installation at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, it is making a reappearance.
Looking to make a statement about species extinction and climate change, the “Next of Kin: Seeing Extinction Through the Artist’s Lens” exhibit features daguerreotype photographs and specimens of extinct, endangered, and threatened animals like the moa.
The exhibit showcases the work of Dartmouth professor Christina Seely, who spoke Wednesday at a panel on the exhibit with Visual and Environmental Studies and History of Art and Architecture professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty and Dartmouth Environmental Studies professor Ross A. Virginia. Edward Morris, co-director of the Canary Lab at Syracuse University, moderated the discussion.In his opening remarks, Morris described the exhibition as a “meditation upon the extinction crisis” and “a memorial for some of the species already lost.”
Seely recounted her experience conducting research in the Harvard museums’ archives and working with faculty members to develop the installation.
She said she choose to imprint the photographs of the endangered and extinct species animals on reflective surfaces to allows the viewers to see themselves within the frame of the portraits. The images were also placed over lights which brighten and dim to evoke gradual extinction.  
The exhibit sought to “work through a conceptual idea to its completion” and try to “honor the essence of the specimen,” Seely said.  The purpose of the installation, Seely said, is not to provide answers for the natural world as scientists may typically do, but instead to inspire questioning and disorientation.
Seely has worked with Virginia in her previous projects, as well as with Morris’s organization The Canary Project, an organization that produces art concerned with ecology and environmentalism. The Canary Project collaborated with Seely on the sculptures featured in “Next of Kin.”
“This is the product of a multi-year effort by Christina,” Virginia said in an interview before the panel. “I think we’re just all trying to find new ways to engage the public in thinking about and taking action on critical issues of climate change and species loss.”

UPDATED: February 24, 2017 at 2:11 a.m. 
A committee studying how to implement the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social organizations has recommended significantly increasing the number of post-graduate fellowships off-limits to members of final clubs and Greek organizations, according to three people involved in crafting the recommendations.
The suggestion is one of multiple recommendations listed in a report the committee prepared and marks an expansion of the College’s original penalties, first announced in May. When Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana unveiled the policy, it applied only to a select few fellowships—like the Rhodes, the Marshall, and the Schwarzman—that require the Dean’s endorsement.
Under the guidelines proposed by the committee, members of single-gender social organizations would be barred from several more post-graduate fellowships.
The significance of the recommendations, however, remains uncertain. Several administrators and a new, separate faculty committee—with the power to replace the entire policy—will review the proposed changes before they go into place.
The College’s current policy—set to take effect with the Class of 2021—will also bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from leadership roles in recognized student organizations and varsity captaincies.
Implementation committee members did not receive copies of the report, developed over the course of last semester, according to several members of the body. Rather, committee co-chairs Douglas A. Melton and Kay K. Shelemay printed copies of the document and placed them in University Hall. Members traveled to the building at select times earlier this month to physically examine the report and offer feedback.
The Crimson granted anonymity to members of the committee because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the report.
After Melton and Shelemay reviewed members’ comments, they submitted a final version of the report to Khurana. Melton, Shelemay, and Khurana declined to comment on the contents of the report until it becomes public.
“I have received the final report of the Implementation Committee, and at this time, am carefully reviewing the Committee’s recommendations,” Khurana wrote in an emailed statement Thursday. “I will release the final report, along with any response, after my review is complete.”
Khurana formed the 36-member implementation committee, composed of students, faculty, and staff, in Sept. 2016. The body has worked for months to craft its recommendations.
In another section of the group’s final report, the implementation committee recommended that The Crimson and the Undergraduate Council be subject to the College’s policy, according to the three committee members. Such a step would aim to bar members of final clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions on either The Crimson or the UC.
In an email sent to undergraduates hours after the announcement of the sanctions last May, then-UC President Shaiba Rather and then-UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 wrote that they were concerned that the sanctions might apply to the Council’s leadership.
“Vetting of elected members of student government based on affiliation in certain groups is detrimental, and fundamentally opposed, to the vivacity of the democratic process,” Rather and Banks wrote.
Current UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, who is a member of the all-female Bee Club, did not speculate on “hypotheticals” in an interview Thursday evening, but said the UC hopes to ensure all students can run for leadership positions.
“In general, one of our top priorities is non-discrimination, so we support any initiative that is trying to remove discrimination,” Sachee said.  “However, we also are an organization that seeks to represent all students on this campus, and we would like our membership to be available to all students.”
In a statement Thursday evening, President of The Crimson Derek K. Choi ’18 said The Crimson is exempt from the College’s policy.
“The Harvard Crimson is editorially, organizationally, and financially independent from Harvard College,” Choi said. “As a result, the sanctions policy does not apply to The Crimson.”
The faculty committee reconsidering the College’s policy will submit its own set of recommendations to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in the fall.

Harvard Law School’s Project on Predatory Student Lending has sued the federal government in an effort to access documents from the Education Management Corporation, an operator of for-profit colleges that settled a case with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2015.
In the original case, filed in 2011, the federal government and five states filed a complaint against the EDMC, alleging illegal recruiting practices and consumer fraud. The case was settled for $95.5 million, none of which went to relief for students who incurred federal loan debt from attending EDMC schools.
“The primary allegation was that EDMC unlawfully recruited students, in contravention of the Higher Education Act’s Incentive Compensation Ban, by running a high pressure boiler room where admissions personnel were paid purely on the number of students they enrolled,” according to the press release from the Department of Justice’s Office of Public Affairs after the case was settled.
The Law School’s Project seeks documents produced by EDMC during the original lawsuit and provide details about the fraudulent practices. Attorneys for the project say the documents could help affected students recover from their debt.
“The documents from this lawsuit regarding EDMC’s recruitment practices are likely to strengthen claims for reliefs of hundreds, if not thousands, of former students of EDMC-owned schools,” wrote Amanda Mangaser Savage ’10, the Project’s attorney who filed the lawsuit, in a press release.
The Project first submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for EDMC’s documents on June 20, 2016, and the Justice Department were summarily denied the request on Sept. 6, 2016, according to the lawsuit.
In Dec. 2016, the Project appealed the denial on the grounds that the Department of Justice’s ruling was not specific enough to justify withholding the records.
Since then, the Department of Justice has not responded to the Project’s request for the documents.
“DOJ’s withholding of responsive records and failure to make a determination with respect to the Project’s appeal not only violate the Project’s rights under FOIA, but also hinder the Project’s ability to obtain relief for former EDMC students; inform the public about for-profit education; and advocate for policies that will protect low-income student loan borrowers,” the plaintiffs write in the lawsuit.
Savage said the Law School Project’s lawsuit aims to benefit students who incurred debt from EDMC schools and also taxpayers whose dollars are going to for-profit colleges. The $95.5 million the case was settled for was “less than one percent of the more than $11 billion in taxpayer-funded federal student grants and loans that the government alleged EDMC received between July 2003 and the suit’s filing,” according to the Project’s press release.
“I think the most palpable way that this will assist students is in getting their federal student loan debt canceled, but I also think there is a significant, broader public interest here,” Savage said.

Cambridge city officials will solicit feedback from the public as it searches for a new police commissioner, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale announced Wednesday.
Robert Hass, Cambridge’s  last police commissioner, retired in May after nine years of service in the role and 40 years of law enforcement work. DePasquale has scheduled two open public forums for Cantabrigians to give input on the search. Specifically, the city officials will seek to learn about leadership qualities residents wish to see in the new commissioner and the biggest challenges facing Cambridge police.
DePasquale also wrote that the city has hired the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit group founded in 1976 with experience in developing community policing and assisting city leaders in “recruiting and selecting well-qualified candidates,” to aid in the search.
The Research Forum will conduct interviews with various city groups over the coming weeks, reaching out to school and university officials, city employees, business leaders, and community associations, among others.
The collective feedback, DePasquale wrote, will help the city develop the final recruitment profile they plan to use when screening candidates.
City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen lauded the city’s decision to involve Cambridge residents in the search process, though the search is only in its preliminary stages.“I think it’s really wise for a city manager to really make it a community affair,” he said. “I think there’s a very long and deep conversation to have about community policing and restorative justice.”
Mazen emphasized the need to ensure that marginalized groups in Cambridge receive equal treatment by the police.
“I want to reach a community that take bias and take conflict out of the equation,” he said. “The issue of racial bias in policing, implicit or explicit, should come up.”
The public forums will be held Thursday, March 2 from 6 to 8 p.m. at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Saturday, March 4 from 10 to 12 p.m. at the Citywide Senior Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second day of a hearing that could decide whether Harvard teaching and research assistants may unionize, lawyers from the University and union effort continued to contest which groups of voters were eligible to cast ballots in November's election.
Thursday’s arguments focused on the “lookback list,” a list of students who were defined as workers one year ago and therefore included in the bargaining unit, but did not work in the fall of 2016. Before the November election, which remains too close to call, Harvard and the union agreed that this group of students would vote under challenge. Now, remaining challenged ballots may determine the fate of the election.
By the time the National Labor Relations Board counted ballots from the election in December, Harvard and the union had resolved the eligibility of most of the challenged ballots, but 313 remained in question.
In December, 1,272 students voted in favor of forming a student union, while 1,456 voted against it. Since the margin of votes was smaller than the number of remaining challenged ballots, the National Labor Relations Board decided to resolve them in hearings.
Harvard’s evidence on Thursday centered around a subgroup of students on the lookback list—Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students who have finished “guaranteed teaching.”
Harvard ensures Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students work as teaching fellows for four semesters, but permits them to teach for more semesters after that. University lawyers argued that students whose guaranteed teaching periods have expired and who are not currently teaching should not count in the election.
Union organizer Andrew B. Donnelly disagreed and said these students should have their ballots counted. “If the administration thinks that its humanities graduate students only teach for four semesters then they have no idea what happens here,” Donnelly said after the hearing.
“The hearing process will continue until all the relevant facts and evidence are presented, and the NLRB issues its decisions based on the totality of these proceedings,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in a statement. “We are eager to conclude this hearing process and confirm the results of this election."
During the first day of the hearing Wednesday, union lawyer Thomas W. Meiklejohn argued there should be a “lookback period” to allow students who had worked at most one year prior to the election to vote, pointing to previous NLRB decisions. The unionization effort argued that these students will likely work for the University again.
“It is Harvard’s contention that none of these individuals should be counted,” Joseph P. McConnell, a lawyer for Harvard, said. “There should be no lookback period. And it’s certainly not an anathema to the Board’s policies that there not be a lookback period.”
Challenged ballots are not the only issue that the NLRB will rule on during the ongoing hearing. Hearing officer Thomas A. Miller will also consider evidence about objections filed by both the union and the University in coming days.
After the vote count in December, the union effort filed an objection arguing that the NLRB should invalidate the results of the November election and call for a re-vote. The union’s lawyers asserted that Harvard’s list of eligible voters was incomplete and prevented eligible voters from casting ballots.
Harvard, too, filed an objection, albeit on a smaller scale. The University argued that the NLRB improperly voided one ballot because the voter wrote a note to the vote counter and drew a smiley face.
According to an order from NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr., the hearing will continue until March 3. If discussions have not concluded by that date, the hearing will resume March 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates will likely remain “insulated” from potential changes in federal healthcare policy, according to University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira.
Since its signing in 2010, Republican lawmakers across the United States have vowed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, which currently provides millions of Americans—and more than 200,000 Massachusetts residents—with health insurance.
In January, Republican lawmakers voted in favor of a budget resolution that instructs committees in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to work towards repealing large parts of the bill. Later that month, Trump signed an executive order giving various federal agencies broad powers to dismantle parts of the Affordable Care Act.
Although Barreira said he is unsure how many Harvard students are insured under the program, he estimated that 60 percent of undergraduates waived health insurance through Harvard’s Student Health Insurance Plan, meaning they are insured through their parents’ plans. According to Barreira, only students who both waived Harvard’s insurance and have parents covered through the Affordable Care Act will be affected in the event of a repeal.
However, even if students covered under Affordable Care Act lose their insurance, Barreira said their care at Harvard would likely not change. He added that Harvard’s student health fee, which all full-time undergraduates are required to pay, covers most services provided through HUHS. Specifically, the fee covers 24-hour urgent care, primary care, mental health services, physical therapy, and surgery, all with no copay.
“Your student health fee pays for the care that you get here and for most of the health care you get,” Barreira said. “The Affordable Care Act wouldn’t change that.”
Benjamin D. Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and a former advisor to former President Barack Obama, agreed that Harvard students would likely suffer little if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.
Sommers said that a Massachusetts-specific policy—a health care reform law passed in 2006—insured most state residents before the Affordable Care Act came into effect. He added that Massachusetts’s own health insurance program is unlikely to change regardless of federal policy.
“Overall, younger adults and people in Massachusetts are fairly insulated from some of the worst potential effects of a repeal. Coverage for people in other states is much more at risk,” Sommers said.
UHS spokesperson Lara Cameron said that even in a worst-case scenario, all Harvard students can enroll in Harvard’s own insurance plan, administered by Blue Cross Blue Shield.
“Students may enroll in the Harvard University Student Health Insurance Plan due to a qualifying life changing event (such as loss of other insurance coverage),” Cameron wrote in an emailed statement. The Student Health Insurance Plan costs $2,630 for two terms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A College subcommittee is working with the Undergraduate Council to improve residential security after a string of dorm thefts this month.
Albert B. Corvah ’18, a Mather House Undergraduate Council representative and a member of the security committee, met with the UC’s student life committee Feb. 13 to discuss potential areas of collaboration between the two groups.
Corvah said the security committee ultimately looks to prevent dorm room thefts, which have occurred at the College in past months with frequency.
Earlier this month, several students reported stolen laptops and wallets in Lowell House, prompting at least two other Houses to send emails urging residents to properly lock their doors. In Lowell, belongings were stolen out of unlocked rooms, according to Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. Earlier this year, students lost thousands of dollars in personal property in a string of similar threats across many river Houses.
Led by Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten, the subcommittee on residential security is a part of the larger Harvard Safety Committee, which strives to raise awareness about security breaches across the College. According to the committee’s website, the group “conducts educational safety campaigns throughout the year and makes recommendations for policy and infrastructure modifications.”
According to Rosengarten, the subcommittee is currently in its investigative stage and plans to finish a report early next month.
Corvah said he met with the UC committee to discuss the issues brought forth at a previous security committee meeting, including the possibility of installing security cameras at certain entry points in Houses and dorms. He added that the committee also ultimately looks to curb students’ habit of propping or taping doors, leaving them unlocked.
Corvah said he hoped for student feedback at the UC committee meeting.
“I was working on behalf of [Rosengarten] because he wanted to hear our opinions,” Corvah said.
A particular idea that received wide support at the meeting, Corvah said, was the possibility of receiving crime and robbery updates from HUPD. He said he thought such updates would remind Harvard undergraduates of the severity of security breaches.
“There are often safety violations like the Kirkland House shooting or robbery sprees like the one in Mather House just last year that can result from students not taking care of their rooms,” Corvah said. “It’s just a matter of pointing to a certain instance to remind them that the risk is real and they could be next.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team has a storied history. The Crimson won 12 Ivy League titles in 13 years between 1981 and 1993 and picked up an NCAA championship in 1990.
Recently, though, Harvard’s status of old as a league powerhouse has seemed more and more like a distant memory.
Over the past five seasons, Harvard has posted a record of 39-40. In fact, the Crimson has only registered a winning record in the Ivy League six times since its last conference championship 24 years ago.
All but one of those winning seasons in-conference came in the last six seasons, with the Crimson making an appearance in the league tournament in each of those years. In short, Harvard’s fortunes seem to be turning around.
Recruiting has played a huge part in the team’s improvement. Since 2011, head coach Lisa Miller has brought on 28 high school All-Americans. In 2014, the team’s incoming freshmen—now seniors—were ranked the seventh-best recruiting class in the nation. That group of rookies has made its worth felt, posting an overall winning record since their arrival and qualifying for three-straight Ivy League tournaments.
But Miller’s requirements for recruits go beyond rankings and on-field accomplishments.
“[I look for players who], beyond their lacrosse skill and athleticism, are team-first kids, incredibly loyal to each other, enthusiastic, never quit, are willing to learn, love to dive in and compete, and my favorite, laugh when they fail and go right back at it,” Miller said.
The formula seems to be working, with all of the program’s winning conference records in the last 20 years achieved by teams composed by Miller and her staff. As such, the expectations for this season’s nine rookies are considerable.
“I have really high hopes for them as a class,” tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey said.  “Not only do I think they will be able to make an impact right away on the field, but I can see the group stepping up as leaders on the team, even as underclassmen.”
The rookies will likely have the greatest impact at attack. Although the team lost a number of key defenders to graduation, the freshman class includes only a single listed defensive player in Tate Green.
Fellow rookie Jackie Cuccurullo is named as a midfielder but has seen time at defense this season. The first-year hails from Smithtown, N.Y., where she won three consecutive all-county honors and was voted all-division once.
Meanwhile Green, a Skaneateles, N.Y., native, garnered three academic All-American honors in high school while picking up 210 ground balls. She also boasts a 70-percent success rate on draws.
Along with Cuccurullo, the rookie defender will likely be called upon right away this season, as the graduation of co-captain and defensive standout Tory Waldstein ’16 left a spot open in the Harvard back line. Green’s skill with draw controls will be valuable for the Crimson, which was third-worst in the Ivy League in that category last season.
Excluding the two defensive-minded players, the rest of the rookie spots are devoted to three midfielders and four attackers, brought in to bolster an already potent offensive unit.
Harvard was ranked in the top three in the Ivy League last season for goals per game and assists per game and was first in the conference in shots on goal per game. The Crimson also stood among the top 50 programs nationwide in points per game.
The majority of Harvard’s formidable front line will return this season, including junior midfielder Julia Glynn and senior attacker Marisa Romeo, who both finished last year among the top 100 players in the country for points per game and assists.
With few spots open, it’s not clear how many of the Crimson freshmen will see significant playing time up front.
Nonetheless, the rookies bring some significant talent to the table. Two of them also arrive with preexisting chemistry, having played for the same high school team. Kristin Burnetta and Hannah Keating both attended the Agnes Irwin School in Pennsylvania, where the duo led its team to a state championship in 2015.
Burnetta was a two-time Academic All-American and was named to the Under Armour Senior All-American team in 2016. She also holds the all-time assists record for Agnes Irwin.
Keating missed her final high school season due to injury but was still voted the fourth-best senior in the country. She was also a U.S. Lacrosse All-American, earned three Under Armour Underclass sections, and was voted the U.S. Lacrosse/Nike Lacrosse player of the year. She finished her scholastic career with 300 goals and 162 draw controls despite missing her senior campaign.
“[Keating] has shown a lot of enthusiasm, effort, selflessness, psychological toughness, persistence, and investment in the program,” Miller lauded.
The standout duo is joined on attack by one of two other freshman not originally from New York. Julia DiNovi hails from Wellesley, M.A., and played for the Noble and Greenough School in Dedham, M.A. In her senior year, she was the team’s leading scorer, as she led the school to its first-ever league title.
The rookie attacking unit is rounded out by Isabella Di Pietro, a two-time all-league honoree at the Trinity School in New York, N.Y. Di Pietro has a direct connection to the Crimson’s successful history, as she is the daughter of Kate Felsen Di Pietro `88, who, as a member of the team, won three Ivy League titles and enjoyed a trip to the Final Four her senior year.
With the Crimson’s offense already stacked with talent, some of the freshman attackers may have to adjust.
“They all will have the opportunity to make an impact right away,” Hennessey said. “A couple of them have slid into midfield positions, allowing us to run a few different middie lines, which has helped to give us more depth in this area of the field.”
However, there won’t be much more space in the midfield, with four rookies joining an already full core of upperclassman returners.
Two first-year midfielders, Bridget Flynn and Katie Muldoon, hail from New York, while the third, Sara Cami, comes to Harvard from San Francisco. Muldoon and Cami were both two-time Academic All-Americans in high school.
Muldoon attended Garden City High School, where she was voted all-county three times. She also guided her team to a New York State championship.
Cami brings an equally impressive list of accomplishments to the team. The midfielder from San Francisco University High School earned three consecutive all-league honors and was chosen as her conference’s player of the year in 2016.
Flynn, having collected three all-county honors for Victor High School, received the sportsmanship award at the 2016 state championships.
The rookie midfielders, along with the rest of the freshman class, will be hoping to convert their impressive list of high school accomplishments into success for their college team, as they seek to put Harvard back on the path to its former powerhouse status.
“Regardless of their position on the field, the freshman class as a whole brings energy and athleticism across the board,” Hennessey said. “I know they will do a great job embodying what it means to be a Harvard athlete, and I hope that they will continue to carry on the legacy that we leave for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior attacker Marisa Romeo has a singular focus when she takes the field for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team.
“I am motivated by my desire to win,” Romeo said.
Her succinct attitude is reflected brightly in the success she’s had as a player. Since her freshman year, Romeo consistently has been both a force for the Crimson and a scoring threat to the entire Ivy League.
Romeo’s career began late in high school when she committed to Harvard, giving the school the country’s seventh-best incoming freshman as ranked by InsideLacrosse.com. As her rookie season in 2014 progressed, her highly-recruited status proved justified, and Romeo has gone on to achieve much more. Since then, the Syracuse, N.Y native has been the team’s top scorer and an All-Ivy player in each of her three years on the team. In her freshman season, Romeo started all 16 matches, ending the season with nine hat tricks and a league-high 48 goals.
Now, as she enters her last season donning the Crimson, Romeo looks to conclude her successful career with another great season. In early January, giving her a jumpstart, InsideLacross.com named Romeo to the preseason Honorable Mention All-American list.
Her history of winning precedes her tenure at Harvard. In high school, she claimed two lacrosse state championships, and the motivation to win Ivy League titles continues to drive the senior attacker to achieve more each game.
Even before she joined the Crimson, Romeo was always passionate about sports, playing almost every sport imaginable. Lacrosse, though, has always topped the list.
“I love lacrosse because it is very fast-paced—there’s a lot of room for creativity and innovation,” Romeo said. “It’s very rewarding.”
However, many players has that one outside factor that keeps them going. For Romeo, it has always been her family.
“My family members are unbelievably supportive of me,” Romeo said. “My family lives five hours away, and they never miss a game. They are so encouraging and have so much confidence in me. I owe anything I've ever accomplished to their unconditional love and support.”
According to Romeo, her passion for lacrosse and love for her family shine through in each game she plays. She also feels that she’s built a new family through Crimson lacrosse. The senior points to the relationships that she’s made on the lacrosse team as pillars defining her time in Cambridge.
The respect and admiration that she holds for her team is mutual.
“Marisa has a huge presence on the field and is a significant piece to the attack,” tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon added.
As a crease attacker, Romeo controls the offensive tempo, an important role in the team’s play. The other captains point to Romeo’s work ethic and commitment as inspirational to the rest of the team.
“She’s the type of player who makes those around her better and is very easy to play with, making her a special player,” McMahon said. “The rest of the team has mimicked [her] commitment in investing extra time outside scheduled practice, which has been great to see.”
Romeo’s contribution to the Crimson attack was illustrated most strikingly during a 2014 road game at Vanderbilt, in which she scored career highs of six goals, six points, and one draw control.
However, Romeo’s success at Harvard has not always come easily. During her sophomore season, the attacker suffered a torn ACL and MCL. The road back from injury was not an easy one, but when she returned to the field, Romeo immediately continued her streak of dominating play.
“Throughout the season [of Romeo’s injury], she became stronger and stronger and regained and increased the ability she had before injury,” McMahon said. “Watching her get back to playing the game she loves at a very high level is definitely a memorable moment I have of her.”
Following her recovery, Romeo consistently led the team in goals and assists, posting season highs of four goals and three assists along the way.
For the Crimson senior, the 2017 lacrosse season has gotten off to a great start. During Harvard’s first game at University of New Hampshire on February 18th, Romeo scored four goals and registered an assist to help lead Harvard to a season-opening victory.
Romeo will hope to maintain that form throughout the season in pursuit of the team’s first Ivy League title since 1993.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A top-heavy Harvard roster graduated 15 seniors in 2016—a class that included two Ivy League First Teamers and a nominee for the Tewaaraton Award, which recognizes the top collegiate player. In the wake of this mass exodus, the 2017 Crimson has mighty shoes to fill.
Last season, Harvard fought to a perfectly even campaign—8-8 overall and 3-3 in the Ivy League. Media members projected a similarly middling record this year. In early February, the inaugural Ivy League preseason poll slotted Harvard at fourth behind Yale, Brown, and Penn. The Crimson received points in the national poll but landed just outside the top 20.
“There’s certainly no one key to our success this year,” tri-captain Ryan Norton said. “But as a team we are focused on being the best we can be in all facets of our lives. We believe that striving for excellence both on the field and in the classroom is vital to our team’s success.”
Missing this year is attackman Devin Dwyer ’16. Last season, the then-senior combined with then-sophomore Morgan Cheek to account for 132 points, good for 44 percent of Harvard’s overall offense.
While Cheek returns, Harvard will miss Dwyer’s productivity. The veteran’s mark of 72 points in 2016 tied the third-highest single-season total in program history, and his four-year aggregate of 211 points ranks third all-time for the program. Dwyer tallied a point in a record 49 consecutive games—a streak which began during his freshman year.
Already, Cheek has proven that he can produce in Dwyer’s absence. In Harvard’s season-opening win at UMass Lowell, the junior notched seven points (four goals and three assists). Still, as any first-grade student can tell you, two is better than one.
“My favorite part about this year’s team is our chemistry,” Norton said. “This is definitely the most close-knit team I have been a part of. Being a cohesive unit on and off the field is another key component to our success.”
The newcomers to the team may well be the deciding factor between a year labeled as “rebuilding” or one in which the team competes for an Ancient Eight title. Of the 300 points that Harvard amassed 2016, the graduating class accounted for 171.
“This year we really want to play fast and push the tempo in transition, and defend teams in transition,” junior goalie Robert Shaw said. “We’ve really got to dominate teams between the lines, on ground balls, faceoffs, and early offense [and if we do so] we’ll be able to have a pretty good season.”
With 57 percent of the Crimson’s offense now graduated (read: investment analysts on Wall Street), Frisbie Family Head Coach Chris Wojcik ’96 will have to look elsewhere for an attacking spark.
In Harvard’s first tilt of the season, that spark came from two freshmen—attackman Ryan Graff and midfielder Dalton Follows. Hailing from Bloomington, Minn., Graff scored three goals off six shots on goal, tallied five ground balls, and caused two turnovers. Meanwhile, the Canadian Follows fired home two scores and scooped three ground balls of his own.
Both underclassmen have deep ties to the Crimson. The father of each player played lacrosse for Harvard. Robert Graff graduated in 1987, and Peter Follows graduated in 1986 after skating for the hockey team.
On the defensive side of the ball, three new faces have appeared. With the departure of Ivy first-teamer Bobby Duvnjak, Stephen Jahelka—the Denver Outlaws’ 14th overall pick—and All-NEILA second-team selection Walter Kirby, the Crimson’s stalwart defense has transitioned to a younger core. Tri-captain Ryan Norton spearheads the unit, and Jonathan Butler (sophomore) and top-50 recruit David Strupp (freshman) round out the trio.
Last season, the team ranked fifth in the Ivy League in goals allowed, conceding nearly 11 scores per game. Meanwhile, Harvard posted 11.4 goals every contest, good for third in the Ancient Eight.
The Bears boasted the most potent obvious by a huge margin—over 16 goals an outing, over four more than nearest competitor Yale. The Crimson may need to approach this level of explosive scoring in order to keep up with top league opponents.
Inside the crease is one place where Harvard sports some consistency. Robert Shaw returns for his junior campaign after playing in all 16 games a year ago. The Canton, Ohio native made 181 saves in his first year as a starter and stopped 53 percent of shots.
“Obviously, we lost a bunch of guys from last year who had been playing for a long time, but we’ve got a lot of new guys who are ready to step into new roles,” Shaw said. “We have a big freshman class—15 guys—and all of them have been doing a good job so far this year. It’s definitely a little different than last year when we had a lot of seniors on defense, but we’re doing our best so far this year, and I’m looking forward to playing with these guys for the next few years.”
With Shaw returning, as well as Cheeks, Norton, and other key contributors, the Crimson has the task of battling off top-ranked opponents. Every year, the Ivy League sports some of the best programs in the country, and it is in this jungle of predators that Harvard must carve out a place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As the snow melts and the days lengthen, the Harvard women’s softball team prepares for the start of its season. The Crimson is ditching the infamous New England weather to open its season at the EMU Madeira Beach Invitational in Madeira Beach, Fla., this upcoming weekend.
Harvard has its eyes set on the Ivy League title that slipped through its fingers last season. The team had a heartbreaking loss to Princeton in the conference’s championship game last May. The program welcomes just five freshmen this season after coach Jenny Allard brought in an eight-person class last year.
“Last year was a turnover year,” Allard said. “We had graduated eight seniors, six of whom were starters. I feel that the now-seniors, then-juniors, really stepped up into some key roles. They had been playing behind seniors and then when those seniors graduated, it was their chance to step in and they really in their own way tried to step up last year.”
As the freshmen look eagerly ahead to the start of their Harvard softball careers, the seniors are looking back as they prepare for their last season on the diamond.
“If I could sum it up concisely, the friendships that I have formed and being part of a hardworking team with a great, gritty culture has been really fun in my time here,” co-captain Savannah Bradley said.
The class of 2017 is made up of six players with a lot of experience to their names in positions across the field.
Harvard has Jillian Leslie and Bradley covering first base, and co-captain Giana Panariello manning second.
Leslie came to Cambridge after a decorated high school career in Gilbert, Ariz. She played in 26 games as a sophomore and 29 as a junior. She split time with Bradley and was a catalyst for Harvard’s offense, chipping in multiple hits in last season’s opening tournaments as well as three RBIs and a stolen base in the Cornell series last year.
Bradley played first and pitched at Strawberry Crest High School in Tampa, Fla. During her prep career, she served as captain of the varsity softball and swimming teams before walking on at Harvard so it was no surprise when she was elected captain after last season. Bradley played in 40 games as a junior, posting a .305 on-base percentage to go along with four doubles and two home runs.
Panariello has had an impact for the Crimson since stepping foot on campus. Her breakout season was her sophomore campaign, in which she played in 37 games with 27 starts. Offensively, she hit four doubles and three home runs. During her junior year, she played in 44 contests and registered 11 doubles, finishing the season with a .318 batting average. Her consistency was key in multiple conference victories and earned her a spot on the All-Ivy League First Team.
The senior class also boasts a pitcher-catcher duo in Lindsey Hagberg and Taylor Cabe. An injury kept Hagberg from the field last spring. As a sophomore, she was able to play in nine games, with five starts, before her injury progressed. Hagberg, along with the rest of her classmates, is healthy and cleared to play for her final season.
Cabe has been a prominent player in the pitching rotation from the get-go. She recorded her first complete game, a four-hit shutout in March of her freshman season. The following year she made 27 appearances, including 12 starts, and posted a 4.12 ERA and 68 strikeouts, which ranked second on the team. Cabe had a coming out party as a junior, posting a 15-3 record and establishing herself as the team’s ace as she entered her senior season. The highlight of her junior campaign came when she blanked Princeton over seven innings to lead her team to a 1-0 victory.
The lone senior in the outfield this season is Los Gatos, Calif. native Cat Callaway. Callaway has been a key utility player for Harvard, seeing action in 40 games during her sophomore year with 39 starts coming at third base. At the plate, she batted .304 with 19 runs batted in, seven doubles, and three homers. Last year as a junior, she made the transition to left field and appeared in 39 games.
“This class has been a very solid, very reliable, very dedicated class for Harvard softball,” Allard said. “I think they have all grown in their owns ways throughout their four years. My goal for them this year is that they all have their best seasons of their careers. That is what I always hope for the seniors—they will leave putting their best season on the field.”
But just as impactful as the seniors’ stats are their contributions to a team culture off the field that fuels their on-field success.
“We have a strong team culture because we are all geared on the mindset of winning an Ivy championship, and that translates into our lives on this side of the river and across the river,”  Bradley said. “We work really hard in school to stay on top of our work. We study in solidarity in dining halls or Starbucks or what have you. We will work on a Friday night when most of Harvard’s campus is not working. So we spend a lot of time together outside of softball.”
The senior class has been consistent and hardworking on the diamond and in the classroom. They have all at some point been recognized by the Coaches’ Association for having a GPA over 3.5 during the season.
“All of the seniors are really looking forward to working towards an Ivy League championship and hopefully finally getting it,” Bradley said. “It is something we have yet to experience in our time here. We are really looking forward to just one last season with our teammates and friends and hopefully getting what we have always been working for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot has changed for the Harvard men’s baseball team in the nearly 10 months since the Crimson played its most recent game. The 2016 season was a rollercoaster of sorts for a program that finished 9-11 in the Ivy League.
Harvard showed flashes of promise during its spring break and early-season trips to the South. Ace Nick Gruener shone against A.J. Puk, the No. 6 overall pick in June’s MLB Draft, and his top-ranked Florida Gators team during the the Crimson’s most high-profile nonconference series of the year.
However, Harvard ended up going just 5-5 over its next 10 nonconference games, seven of which came against teams from the Northeast that finished the season with losing records. Harvard’s hopes of winning its first Ivy League championship since 2005 were essentially dashed in the conference’s opening weekend after the team dropped all four of its contests to Cornell and Princeton.
The Crimson did finish with some individual milestones and wins over top teams, splitting with Columbia and Penn while taking three of four from Yale, the eventual Red Rolfe Division champion. The conference record was the best in coach Bill Decker’s four seasons in Cambridge.
As unpredictable as the team was last spring, its offseason was arguably even more tumultuous. In addition to graduating nine seniors, the team lost Gruener, the top junior arm in the conference last season, when he was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 22nd round of the MLB Draft and opted to forgo his final year of eligibility and sign. Four other players from last year’s squad—Greg Coman, Dylan Combs, Conor Quinn, and Kevin Rex—also left the team.
Of the 28 players on this year’s Harvard roster, only nine are upperclassmen. Given the personnel changes, the biggest question mark for the Crimson this season is its pitching staff. Junior Ian Miller and sophomores Kevin Stone and Simon Rosenblum-Larson figure to be three of the team’s four weekend starters. The trio combined to start 21 games last season, with Stone leading the way with a 4.22 earned run average and four wins.
“We’re in an exciting spot,” Miller said. “The guys who have been here for a while were able to learn from some really great pitchers, but at the same time, we’re at a point where a lot of guys are going to have to step up and pitch well for us this year. Even though we have a void to fill, guys are really stepping up for us. I think we can be a very exciting and dangerous pitching staff.”
Harvard will largely rely on pitchers with little or no college experience to fill key roles this season. Junior Noah Zavolas will slide into the fourth rotation spot while classmate Garrett Rupp, who appeared in just one game last season, will shoulder a more prominent role out of the bullpen this year. The pair gave up 12 earned runs in seven-and-a-third innings last season.
Decker’s freshman recruiting class features four pitchers, each of whom will be tested early and often. Hunter Bigge and Kieran Shaw are righties who hail from the same Bay Area hometown, while 6’6” Grant Stone is the younger brother of Kevin Stone. With the departures of Coman, Combs, and Rex, JT Bernard is the only left-handed pitcher on the roster. Last season’s squad featured 16 pitchers while this year’s has only 10, including senior Matt Hink, who was recruited as a pitcher and first baseman but did not pitch during his first three seasons.
“What people see when they look at our roster is that we did lose a lot on the pitching side,” Hink said. “So far, the freshmen especially have stepped into the role pretty well. I think they’ll obviously have those goosebumps and nerves at the beginning, but I think they’ve now seen that they’re going to play a huge role.”
While uncertainty abounds on the mound, the infield will be Harvard’s greatest strength this season. John Fallon and Matt Rothberg both had breakout seasons as sophomores last year. Fallon, who is recovering from knee surgery but is expected to be ready for the start of the season, led the team in home runs and received both Juniors and All-Ivy Honorable Mentions.  Rothenberg had the highest batting average among regulars and was first among Crimson players in walks and doubles.
Senior Drew Reid has been the team’s starting shortstop for each of the last two seasons but struggled to get on base last season. Sophomore Patrick McColl was a bright spot for Harvard last year while filling in for an injured Hink at first base. The Los Altos, Calif. native drove in 21 runs and was fourth on the team in hits. He figures to shoulder a bigger offensive load and bat in the middle of the Crimson lineup this season. Freshmen Quinn Hoffman and Chad Minato are both highly-touted middle infielders.
“The really cool part about practice at this point is getting to see the younger guys start to compete against the established teammates that we’ve had,” Miller said. “So far, the freshmen have been very successful. It’s been cool to see them grow as players.”
With Hink fully healthy, Decker will have to be creative when it comes to getting bats in the lineup. Fallon and Reid will make up the left side of the infield while Rothenberg has played all four infield positions and the outfield during his time in Cambridge. He was the team’s primary designated hitter last season when he was second in the Ivy League in batting average.
Captain Josh Ellis was an Ivy League Honorable Mention last season after slashing .304/.375/.374 in 40 games. The senior will see the lion’s share of his innings behind the plate, but has also played outfield for Harvard. Ellis, Fallon, McColl, and Rothenberg figure to make up four of the top five spots in the Crimson’s batting order.
With the departure of Quinn, the success of the outfield will largely hinge on Harvard’s sophomore class. Trent Bryan and Ben Skinner were regulars for the Crimson last season. Bryan was the team’s starting center fielder while Skinner found his stride during Ivy League play, reaching base in 13 consecutive games and stealing five bases on the season.
Sophomores John MacLean and Patrick Robinson combined for 68 at-bats last season and figure to split time in right field. On an extremely versatile roster, Ellis, Rothenberg, McColl, junior Austin Black, sophomore Dylan Peterson, and freshman Jake Suddleson could also see time in the outfield. While the problem with pitching for Harvard this spring likely will be lack of experience and keeping arms fresh, on offense it will center around forming a lineup for each game that draws from a deep pool of both experience and talent.
“The pitchers have done a really good job of being aggressive, throwing a lot of pitches for strikes, and the hitters at the same time, to their credit, have put some really good swings on the ball, have worked some really good at-bats against quality pitching,” Miller said. “It’s a nice even split, and I think that’s a really good place to be in.”
The Crimson will begin its season in the nation’s capital next weekend with doubleheaders against Lafayette and Coppin State. The team will spend spring break in Florida, playing 10 games in as many days in three different cities.
“All Ivy League teams try to stack the front end of their schedule with some really difficult teams,” Miller said. “The Ivy League teams are surprisingly competitive with the teams they play on the front end. It’s a really good way to prepare for the Ivy League when we get to face some of the top teams down South.”
Games against Army and Holy Cross precede Harvard’s Ivy League opener against Columbia on April 1. The Crimson will take on UMass in the first round of the Beanpot and will face off against either Boston College or Northeastern at Fenway Park on April 19. Harvard hosts Yale April 15 and 16 before closing out its 20-game Ivy League regular season with two home games against Dartmouth on April 30.
The conference’s top two teams on paper—Columbia and Penn—are both in the Lou Gehrig Division, meaning that the Crimson has to face each program only twice during the regular season.
Yale broke Dartmouth’s streak of eight consecutive Red Rolfe Division crowns and returns All-Ivy pitcher Scott Politz. Despite the graduation of Duncan Robinson, Dartmouth looks poised to make another run at the division crown due to its strong pitching staff.
Senior right-hander Christian Taugner is one of the best arms in the conference and leads a Brown team that was tied with Harvard for third in the Red Rolfe Division a season ago. If the Crimson wants to bring home its first division crown since 2006, its largely untested pitchers will need to step up in bigger roles and stay healthy while its offense will have to be consistent throughout conference play, something the team has struggled to do in recent years.


“I think our pitchers are pitching it well,” Hink said. “I think offensively, in my four years here, this is one of the better offensive bubble seasons we’ve had. If we can stay healthy and keep the same mindset we have right now, good things will come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard baseball takes the field for its 2017 season opener against Lafayette, two of the team’s coaches will have the distinction of commencing their “first year” with the team—a slight misnomer given that they both have over six months of experience working within the Crimson’s coaching structure.
Technically, though, Ron Rakowski and Tom Conley are first-year assistant coaches. The titles don’t translate to a lack of experience. Talking to them within the confines of Dillon Fieldhouse leaves one with the impression that Harvard baseball is in experienced hands—and the new duo hasn’t even relayed any hand signals yet.
BUILDING CULTURE
Rakowski, who graduated from San Francisco State in 2002, is the new pitching coach and assistant recruiting coordinator. Conley, a 2012 graduate of UMass, is the new first base coach and primary coach for the catchers.
In their short time working with the Crimson thus far, both have bought into the culture that Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 Head Coach Bill Decker has created in the clubhouse—and have worked to transition that to the players.
“We’re all working together, we all lean on each other, and [we’re building] a culture where we compete every day and we are great teammates,” Rakowski said. “It’s one where we’re all working towards the same goal. We want the players to be leaders, not just here on the baseball field, but in the community and in the classroom.”
Rakowski and Conley were brought onto the Crimson coaching staff in the mid-late summer of 2016 as part of the program’s transition away from previous assistant and volunteer assistant coaches Mike Zindler and Ernie Mays.
“I am excited for our players and program that Ron will be our pitching coach moving forward,” Decker said in July 2016, speaking on Rakowski’s hiring. “He brings a wealth of experience and success to the program and is truly passionate and enthusiastic in his ways, especially when it relates to the coaching, mentoring, and day-to-day relationships with players.”
Conley joined the team soon after Rakowski, coming to Cambridge in August after receiving his master’s degree from Trinity earlier in 2016, where he worked with the Bantam catchers and hitters for three seasons. Though his coaching career is shorter than Rakowski’s, Conley first experienced success as a coach in his very first year—the 2012-13 season—of volunteer assistant coaching at Bryant. That season, the Bulldogs went 45-18-1 and advanced to the Manhattan Regional in what the team’s website describes as “one of the greatest, and most historic, seasons in Bulldogs history.”
“We had a really good team that year,” said Conley, describing his learning experience as a first-year coach out of college. “It was fun to be a small part of it—that was a great experience for me right out of the gate. I had a great head coach at Bryant. [Bulldog head coach Steve Owens] was a really competitive guy, demanded a lot from the players, and at the same time rewarded them when they played well. [He] tried to pick them up when they were down.”
Rakowski, for his part, brings a wealth of experience at all levels of baseball to the Crimson dugout. Since graduating in 2002, Rakowski has coached at the Division I, Division II, Division III, and junior college levels, primarily working with pitchers. His learned credo of improving all characteristics of a student athlete is something he’ll be carrying over to O’Donnell Field.
“Coaching is coaching,” Rakowski said. “Wherever you go, whether that’s Division III or Division I, ACC or Ivy League, whatever it is, I think the trick is to help the student athletes develop not only as players, but as people as well. I think that’s the one universal thing.”
RECRUITING ON A HIGH LEVEL
Rakowski’s passion is evident when he talks about the academics-athletics nexus. Since part of his duties are to assist with recruiting at Harvard, he’s big into examining how the two pillars can complement each other when recruiting top high school talent.
“Baseball is really based around making it a positive experience for the players,” Rakowski said. “I tell people all the time that at a lot of institutions, especially in academic institutions, there can tend to be friction between the athletic and academic sides. The biggest thing I’ve found here is how wonderful the relationship is between the athletic and academic components here at Harvard. They really work to help the other.”
Decker has praised Rakowski’s recruiting know-how in the past, and the new Crimson pitching coach also has experience getting high school recruits to the next level. During his tenure with the Crusaders, Rakowski helped 27 players earn All-Patriot League recognition. In addition, he mentored five players selected in the MLB draft.
“I know the coaches here at Harvard, our staff and all the other coaches here in the athletic department, and our athletic administration, work extremely hard to make sure our student-athletes get everything they need from an academic standpoint,” Rakowski said. “In return, the academic side of the school really embraces the fact that we have the largest athletic department in the country. And they embrace that and they allow those kids to really enjoy that experience here.”
Rakowski and Conley’s sharp focus on intimate player development holds quite a bit of promise for the pitchers, catchers, and the rest of the team as they prepare to travel to Washington, D.C. on Mar. 3.
“You go to some places, and you don’t see that really good balance,” Conley adds. “When the players cross the river and come over here, there’s just a different mindset, and they’re all baseball. And then they go back over, and it’s all class. I’ve been really impressed with it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team enters 2017 with a chip on its shoulder after coming within one game of winning an Ivy League championship and advancing to the NCAA Regional tournament in 2016.
A season ago, the Crimson got off to an uneven start, at one point losing five games in a row between the Loyola Marymount Tournament and the San Diego State Classic.
However, the team regrouped after the tournaments, rattling off two separate winning streaks of eight games to finish the season 29-17. Harvard also went 16-4 in Ivy League play, good for the best record in the conference.
This barrage of wins set up a best-of-three showdown between the Crimson and the Princeton Tigers in the Ivy League Championship Series. Princeton prevailed in three games on Harvard’s home turf, however, sending the Tigers to the NCAA Regionals and putting an abrupt end to the Crimson’s season.
Harvard has won six Ivy titles since the league’s inception in 1980. This mark is second only to Princeton, which added its 17th title after its triumph over Harvard last year.
“Our goal all the time is to win an Ivy championship,” co-captain Savannah Bradley said. “We’ve been working toward that these past few years, and we got the closest that we have been in a while last year.”
The Crimson did lose several key pieces to graduation after its Ivy League championship bid, but improvement from returning players coupled with contributions from incoming freshmen should put Harvard back in contention for another title this season.
OFFENSE
The Crimson likely will continue to be an offensive force in the Ivy League in 2017. The team returns many of its top contributors this season, with the only significant losses being 2016 co-captain and outfielder Zoe Galindo and utility infielder Haley Davis.
Junior Maddy Kaplan and sophomores Rhianna Rich and Meagan Lantz will once again be counted on to do damage at the plate.
Kaplan seemed to be on base all the time last season, raking her way to a .472 average and a 1.163 OPS. The Santa Monica, Calif. native anchored the offense, playing both left field and designated hitter.
Rich, the starting shortstop, contributed a .381 average to go along with a .971 OPS out of the leadoff spot in 2016. She essentially took the reigns from the outset of the season, playing a full slate of 46 games.
Lantz provided much of Harvard’s power, leading the team with seven home runs and 37 RBI, the second-most runs batted in among all Ivy League players. Lantz also swiped 10 bases and played solid defense at the hot corner.
The incoming freshman class can produce all over the diamond and will be depended on to fill any gaps in production both offensively and defensively.
“We brought in an infielder who can play second, short, and third,” Allard said. “We brought in a utility player who can play the infield or the outfield. We brought in another pitcher who can play first and can hit, so I think the big words for these freshmen are versatility and depth.”
PITCHING
Last season, Allard opted for a rotation with two main starters and a mix of bullpen arms who could also stand in and make spot starts as necessary. This year, the rotation may take a different form after the departure of 2016 co-captain Morgan Groom.
“That’s kind of what worked last year,” Allard said. “This year we might have four starters. As we head into the conference, we’re going to play the same team some weekends four times, so we’ll have to see where people are, where their development is, and where they’re effective.”
Last season, Groom pitched to a 10-4 record with a sterling 2.30 ERA, second-best in the Ancient Eight. She also recorded 95 strikeouts.
Returning this year will be Groom’s 2016 counterpart, senior Taylor Cabe. The Boiling Springs, S.C. native contributed 15 wins, second-most among Ivy pitchers, to go along with a 3.12 ERA. She starts the 2017 season as the presumptive ace of the staff.
Behind Cabe, there are some question marks. Allard has a mix of sophomore and freshmen pitchers who will slot in behind Cabe both to start games and come out of the bullpen.
“All of our pitchers tend to throw a lot of innings,” Bradley said. “Obviously we’ll see the leadership from our senior pitcher, Taylor, but we’re also looking to use the depth that we have in our pitching staff.”
Sophomores Sarah Smith, Katie Duncan, and Nicki Nishizawa all will have to make up for the 103.1 innings tossed by Groom the previous year. Smith and Duncan both pitched in key spots in the late innings and in spot starts last season.
“Last year Sarah Smith was so very effective for us as a closer… but this year she’s really worked hard to be a strong starter, so she’s going to be somebody that can play both roles,” Allard said.
Along with Cabe and the trio of sophomores, freshmen Olivia Giaquinto and Alissa Hiener will spend some time in the circle.
IVY LEAGUE OUTLOOK
Though the Crimson has retained much of its core from last year, it will still have to contend with a fairly deep Ivy League. Alongside Harvard, Dartmouth and Princeton stand atop the league.
All eight Ivy teams have to deal with difficult competition at the weekend tournaments early on in the season, but relative to other Northeast teams, the Ivy League is competitive. The only clear-cut bottom feeder team in 2016 was Cornell, which tallied only three wins in 20 league games.
Allard cautions against counting out any Ancient Eight squads, however. The 23-year veteran skipper remarks that on any given day the Crimson has to be prepared for a tough contest due to the relative parity in the conference.
“We think every team in the Ivy League is a tough competitor, so we’re always bringing our A-game no matter who’s on the other side of the field,” said Bradley, echoing her coach’s sentiments.
Two other factors complicating Ivy League play are other teams’ familiarity with Harvard’s breakout stars of 2016 and a new crop of talent throughout the league.
“Coaches in the conference are really going to have strategies against some players who established themselves as key starters,” said Allard, referring to Lantz and Rich in particular. “In the conference, there are several new freshmen pitchers, so I’m really interested to see how those freshmen pitchers develop.”
One of the league’s dominant offensive forces, Dartmouth shortstop Katie McEachern, has graduated, much to the relief of Ivy League pitchers. McEachern topped the league in home runs in 2016 with 12, and she also hit .442 with a 1.380 OPS.
However Penn’s Alexis Sargent, arguably the league’s top pitcher in 2016, returns in 2017 for her senior year. Sargent paced the Ivy League with a 2.29 ERA and 124 punch-outs, holding opposing hitters to a meager .237 batting average.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re going to learn a lot about the Yale men’s basketball team this weekend. The Bulldogs are losers of its last three and find themselves sitting two games behind Harvard for the second spot in the Ivy League and two games ahead of Penn, a team that streamrolled the Elis in New Haven last Sunday. The team’s recent play has raised some questions about how good Yale really is. Wins over the Bulldogs by the Crimson and Quakers have served as signature Ivy League wins for both programs, but given Yale’s poor performance, are those wins really as valuable as they seem?
Yale was picked third in the preseason coaches’ poll behind Princeton and Harvard after losing star junior point guard Makai Mason to a foot injury. Despite the injury, the Yale University Sports Analytics Group gave the Bulldogs a 98.5 percent chance of making the inaugural Ivy League Tournament.
Yale shocked anyone who was aware of Mason’s injury when it opened the season with a win on the road against a Washington team led by Markelle Fultz, the projected top pick in June’s NBA Draft. Four days later, the Bulldogs impressed its home crowd with a win over Lehigh, the favorite to win the Patriot League in the conference’s preseason poll. As every Ivy League team with tournament aspiration does (see: Harvard, 2014), Yale looked like a junior varsity team against Virginia in Charlottesville. The Bulldogs lost by 24 to the Cavaliers before dropping a five-point decision to another ACC foe in Pittsburgh two days later.
After Thanksgiving, Yale lost by two to a Vermont team that was the last squad to hand the Crimson a double-digit loss. Four nights later, the Bulldogs suffered its worst loss of the season, a 79-70 defeat at the hands of a Bryant team that lost to Brown and Dartmouth—which have combined to go 17-32 this season—and fell by 39 to the Bulldogs last season in New Haven. Yale turned the ball over 18 times and blew a 15-point lead down the stretch as its losing streak reached four games. A soft stretch in its schedule allowed the Bulldogs to win its next four before falling to Temple on the road to close out 2016. That streakiness has been a common theme this season for Yale.
As Ivy League play began, the Bulldogs looked like a scary team on the surface. It had won eight of its 13 non conference games, including six of its last seven. The team took care of Penn on the road before falling to Princeton in a close game to open Ivy League play. Yale had a bit of Harvard syndrome against Brown the following weekend, playing a terrible first half before staging a comeback after the break to win by one.
Since weekend back-to-backs have begun, the Bulldogs have been consistent but not always in a good way. It beat Columbia and Cornell in similar fashions. Against Dartmouth and the Crimson the following weekend, it had strong first halves both nights and tried to hold on. Yale was successful against the Big Green,  but lost to the Crimson by eight. Last weekend, the Bulldogs was still hungover from its 19-point loss to the Tigers and was almost successful in losing to the Quakers by a larger margin.
So, what has changed? The difference between its last four games and the three preceding ones is stark. The most glaring difference for Yale has been in the scoring column. The Bulldogs has been averaging fewer than 62 points per game over its last four contests, quite a drop from its season average of 73.5 points per game. Poor three-point shooting and turnovers are at the root of the offensive cold spell. The Bulldogs has shot 26 percent from long range over its last four and has more turnovers (58) than assists (48) during that same stretch.
Yale is streaky and its level of play largely depends on the style of its opponent. When the Bulldogs can get inside offensively, it usually wins. When it has to be a jump-shooting team, it does not. Against the Quakers on Sunday, it was outscored 40-20 in the paint. During its three-game win streak against Brown, Columbia, and Cornell, Yale got to the free throw line 90 times. Over its last four, the Bulldogs have taken just 56 attempts from the charity stripe.
The Yale of 2016-2017 doesn’t deserve the “could beat anyone, could lose to anyone” label befitting the 2015-2016 Crimson since it has beaten most of the teams it was supposed to, but the Bulldogs do not look as scary as it did in December or January.
How Yale fares against the Crimson on Saturday will tell us a lot about whether the Bulldogs have a real chance of leaving Philadelphia with a trophy or if the team is just there as a formality for Harvard or Princeton.
Now to the picks:
YALE AT HARVARD
The sports section of the Yale Daily News—a newspaper, we think—recently published a piece with the following title—By the Numbers: Counting Yale’s Losses. We’re well aware counting isn’t necessarily a strong suit for students down in New Haven, but losing isn’t the kind of thing you’d want to advertise either.
To be quite honest, we didn’t actually bother to read it given the fact we think the title said it all: Yale takes L’s. Friday probably won’t be any different.
Pick: Harvard
PENN AT CORNELL
A year ago this game would be pretty much meaningless. With the addition of the conference tournament, however, Penn is fighting for its opportunity at a postseason of sorts.
With Columbia taking on Princeton on the same night, this may  be the Quakers' best shot to set themselves up for a loss at their home arena when they are technically the road team. If that doesn't get you excited for the Ivy League Tournament, I don't know what will.
Pick: Penn
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
Opponents might argue that a Brown Bear could in fact maul a Big Green, but the thought and intangibility of this only inspires a images of a herbivorous beast lost somewhere between Providence and Hanover. Either way, it’s not a good look for Brown.
Pick: Dartmouth 
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
We’ll defer to what we said earlier this season: ancient gambling markets suggest the tiger mauls the lion most of the time.
Pick: Princeton
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
We know these things are supposed to be unbiased, but seeing as how that went out of the window after our first pick, we’re throwing it all out here—we have been absolutely aching to see Princeton lose in conference all season. The Tigers are a team that you just can’t get behind. To prove our point we once again dove into Princeton’s assortment of self ascribed ‘fun’ facts. Here’s what we’ve got this week: “The nation’s first cheer took place at Princeton during a football game in the late 1880s, when a group of male students led a crowd in the first recorded, organized chant, which today is Princeton’s legendary ‘locomotive.’”
We have never in our lives heard about this ‘legendary’ cheer.
We did, however, witness the cheers coming from Princeton’s bench a few weeks back when it stole a win at Lavietes off a missed free throw.
Pick: Princeton
PENN AT COLUMBIA
We think the reason that we’re so bad at these is because a lot of the Saturday games are pretty contingent on what happens Friday. We usually don’t get Friday right, so Saturday is pretty much a coin toss when you consider how bad at this we are.
In all seriousness though, if Penn wins on Friday and Columbia inevitably takes an L to the Tigers, then a win here would ice the four seed for Penn.
It sounds almost sacrilegious to say the Quakers smell blood so we’ll just say Penn men’s basketball has a strong incentive to win this one.
Pick: Penn
YALE AT DARTMOUTH
Brutal. 
Pick: Yale
BROWN AT HARVARD
Last week we discovered that the Columbia Spectator quite endearingly refers to Columbia as the ‘Light Blue’ despite its savage mascot.
This week we realized the Brown isn’t far behind, lovingly referring to its mascot as Bruno—we’re not 100 percent sure the Quaker smelling blood thing was sacrilegious but calling a bear Bruno most definitely is.
When Brown moves past this, then maybe it can move past Harvard too.
Pick: Harvard

Unless you’ve avoided human contact for the last 24-48 hours, it shouldn't be news to you that Rihanna is coming to campus next week. Yes, Rihanna, the love of our lives ever since “Unfaithful” made us consider ending it with our 4th grade significant other. And while we ended up miserable  after trying to follow the advice from her songs, we still have love for her. Not everyone (read: not you) can be a savage like Rihanna.
Here’s the rundown on Ms. Fenty’s visit—as if we needed prompting to be at this event. As if.
Actual Event: Why are we this blessed?
As great as Harvard students tend to think we are, Rihanna is not coming just to hang out with us. She’s being presented with the the Harvard Foundation’s Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian of the Year Award. The Harvard Foundation. Aka the people who are also bringing Viola Davis on Mar. 4. Aka the people who seem very dedicated to preventing our mental breakdowns over the next two weeks.
Ms. Fenty is being presented with this award for all the charitable work, work, work, work, work she’s been doing. And she’s done this all while dealing with Drake’s childishness!
Time and Date: The best moment of our young lives
If you’re lucky, you’ll get to breathe the same air as Rihanna as soon as next week. She’s coming on Tuesday, February 28th from 4:00 to 5:30 p.m. If you’re one of those unlucky souls who have class or section during this time, we are not telling you to skip class. On the other hand, we’re not not telling you to skip class.
Location: So we know where to camp out
Sanders Theatre. Finally there might be an event magical enough to rid us of two semesters worth of Ec10 PTSD. What could be more intimate than a room with Rihanna and 1,000 of her closest friends?
Ticketing: Will we have to sell our souls?
This event is free. We’re so excited about it that we’re going to repeat it. This event is free. We don’t have to offer up our firstborn to see her. And don't try to say you wouldn't do that. Because that’s a lie. You would. We all would.
Tickets are only in-person distribution. You have to go pick up your ticket at noon from Sanders Theatre the day of the event (Tuesday, February 28). It’s first-come, first-serve, so if you’re a true fan, you better be lining up early.
Once again, if you’re unlucky enough to have class, we’re not telling you how to live your life. But every person can pick up two tickets, so we hope you have a friend who likes you.
Lastly, this event is only for Harvard ID holders. So if you’re reading this from your MIT or Tufts dorm room, it’s too late. We don’t feel bad at all. But we do appreciate your page views.
Much Rihanna Love,
Flyby.
