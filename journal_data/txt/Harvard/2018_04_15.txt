After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first saw Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” in middle school. Of course, as with many adolescent boys of the time, I was fascinated [by][WITH] space, and I went into the film fully expecting aliens, faster-than-light travel, and hyper-advanced technology. In all fairness, “2001” did deliver, but I reached the end credits not with the thrill of a flashy space battle, but with confusion, wondering “What on earth did I just watch?” The year 2001 is long gone, but through the simple space saga, which turns 50 this April, Kubrick has captured a timeless picture of humanity’s pursuit of the unknown.
The story begins millions of years ago with a tribe of ape-like creatures in the wilderness. After suffering attacks from an enemy tribe, they learn to create weapons and soon overpower their now inferior counterparts. As the tribe’s leader throws his club in the air, the scene cuts to a space station in the near-future version of 2001.
Scientists David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) venture on an extended research mission to Jupiter. In charge of ship and instrument operations is the artificial intelligence entity HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), a model purportedly “foolproof and incapable of error.” However, as the mission continues, HAL experiences a psychological breakdown, ultimately forcing a confrontation between man and machine. Bowman, the sole survivor, completes the journey, only to encounter a mysterious extraterrestrial monolith, hurtle through a montage of surreal lights and colors, and seemingly break the laws of time and space.
Director Stanley Kubrick is responsible for bringing this vision of the stars to Earth. He came among a midst of “New Hollywood” directors, who arose in the ’60s to challenge the traditional plotlines and artistic decisions of the silent and Golden eras of film. His filmography includes “A Clockwork Orange” and “Dr. Strangelove,” displaying a particular interest in the bizarre. His work touches issues contemporary to his time—the space race, nuclear holocaust, or totalitarianism—yet they also strike a chord with people’s deepest doubts and worries. What is free will? What is insanity? What have we done for mankind? And what is our purpose?
Avant-garde both for his time and ours, Kubrick’s artistic vision was often received with mixed opinions. “2001” gave him his first and only solo Oscar. To be fair, “2001” is not for everyone. If Kubrick helped usher modern art into the film world, his monumental space age piece represents surrealism: Hated by some, loved by others, but bizarre to everyone. Numerous articles and speculation have arisen since the original showing, as people attempted to make sense of the last sequence. Some believe that Bowman represents the first of a new stage of human evolution. Others argue that the film depicts the victory of the human soul over the body and technology. A few claimed that Bowman returned to Earth to destroy it. Part of the very allure of “2001” is its absolute ambiguity, leaving the interpretation entirely in the mind of the viewer.
Part of the heavy weight of the film comes from how very sparse it is in terms of human interaction. Neither the first nor the last 20 minutes of the film contain any dialogue. There are only two conscious men on board the ship. Space is silent, isolated, and empty. The entirety of the journey has an abstract, detached feel about it. Bowman and Poole never receive the benefit of character development, leaving them as generic templates of humanity.
The one character we do understand is the least human of them all: HAL 9000. He is the apex of reason, the sum total of human knowledge. He is adaptable, sentient, and totally obedient—in short, the best that technology has to offer. Unfortunately, HAL’s own logical perfection is his undoing, as he cannot reconcile his mandate for confidentiality with his programmed candidness. As a result, he is compelled to kill his human companions to fulfill his orders. Yet, even when he is being shut down by Bowman, HAL is the one character to show emotion: “I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it.”
The antithesis to HAL’s rationalism is the monolith. In the film, it appears as a solid, smooth, black slab of stone, far too perfectly formed to be natural. It appears in the opening sequence, as the ape-men learn to use weaponry. It appears on the moon, prompting the expedition to Jupiter. It reveals itself once more to Bowman at the end of his journey, taking him on the whirlwind ride through space and time. Those who watch the movie realize that the monolith holds some tremendous, possibly alien, significance. The movie, however, never reveals its purpose.
The trials of David Bowman are another step in the evolution of mankind. The movie concludes with Bowman watching himself turn into an elderly man, die, and become a transcendental fetus hovering over the earth. As apes progressed into humans, and humans into space voyagers, Bowman’s final encounter with the monolith notes another landmark for the species. But what does the final sequence mean? Is Bowman God? Does he destroy the earth to start anew? Does he even exist in our form of reality? Again, Kubrick leaves these questions unanswered.
“2001,” possibly the greatest work of science fiction in film since Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis,” was both a child of and an advocate for the technological age. With the Space Race in full swing between the United States and Russia, “2001” jumped on people’s fascination with space travel. In turn, the film paved the way for the rise of sci-fi in popular culture. Rotating white-paneled space stations, sleep stasis, and rogue A.I. all came to be staples of film’s space age. Later in the same year “2001” came out, “Planet of the Apes” was released, to be followed by the likes of “Star Wars,” “Blade Runner,” and “Terminator.”
50 years ago, in 1968, Stanley Kubrick launched a legacy of science fiction, representing the ongoing pursuit of mankind for higher being. The very next year, Apollo 11 would land on the moon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coming-of-age genre boasts countless iconic scenes featuring teenage girls dancing alone in their bedrooms. Episode 17 of “My So-Called Life” (1994-5) perhaps best captures this liberated and uncaring expression of pure joy when protagonist Angela Chase (Claire Danes), having just gotten over a boy, jumps around her room while blasting “Blister in the Sun” by Violent Femmes.
As Pitchfork’s Steven Hyden writes, “Blister in the Sun” endures thanks to its immortal status as “a killer kick-off for your ‘I’m an Edgy Outsider and Want to Be Appreciated As Such’ mix,” surviving the evolution of music sharing from mixtapes to mix CDs to collaborative Spotify playlists. To this day, nose ring-wearing teens immediately recognize the song’s opening guitar riff. However, “Blister in the Sun” isn’t the only relevant hit off Violent Femmes’ 1983 self-titled debut. “Kiss Off,” “Add It Up,” and “Gone Daddy Gone” (made even more popular when CeeLo Green’s soul duo Gnarls Barkley covered the song in 2006) are just as familiar as the album’s opening track.
Depending on the listener, “Violent Femmes” sounds either like a bunch of teenagers whining about why they can’t get laid, or like a raw, exhilarating expression of the tender transitional period between childhood and adulthood, fueled by a lush cacophony of twangy acoustic instruments. For some audiences, part of what makes “Violent Femmes” so appealing is its simultaneous familiarity and unfamiliarity. The growing pains associated with coming of age are universally salient—almost everyone feels ugly (as explored in “Ugly”), lonely (as explored in “Confessions”), and horny (as explored in “Add It Up,” among other songs). However, not everyone is familiar with the genre of folk punk, especially folk punk made by three unassuming teenagers from Wisconsin. Although “Violent Femmes” is chock full of oddities, from marimba riffs and goofy falsettos to cartoonish voices and a lead singer who isn’t actually so great at singing, each song off the album has a totally infectious, singable melody that’s friendly enough for a mainstream audience.
Violent Femmes actually pioneered the fusion of folk and punk, paving the way for everyone from the country-inflicted Meat Puppets to gypsy punks like Gogol Bordello. In addition, Gano’s wordy, neurotic singing style seems to have inspired all sorts of indie rock lead singers, like Stephen Malkmus, Jeff Mangum, and Thurston Moore. New York Times music critic Robert Palmer was so impressed with “Violent Femmes” when it first came out that he compared Gano to Lou Reed and folk-era Bob Dylan.
Musically, “Violent Femmes” rocks, even today. That being said, in the age of #MeToo, singer Gordon Gano’s lyrics aren’t as easy to swallow as they may have been in the past, since Gano aggressively begs women to have sex with him, demonstrating a lack of respect for the rules of consent and a belief that women owe him sex just because he wants it. Gano most explicitly does this in “Add It Up,” and in these verses, specifically:
Why can't I get just one kiss?Why can't I get just one kiss?Believe me, there'd be some things that I wouldn't miss.But I look at your pants and I need a kiss.
Why can't I get just one screw?Why can't I get just one screw?Believe me, I know what to do.But something won't let me make love to you.
Why can't I get just one fuck?Why can't I get just one fuck?I guess it got something to do with luck.But I waited my whole life for just one.
Feminists today fight the notion that women owe men sex, and here, Gano seems to believe that this woman owes him a kiss, a screw, or a fuck. Gano also isn’t exactly a role model for practicing good consent here, as he does not respect this woman when it’s implied she’s said “no” to his sexual advances.
Gano also sounds potentially threatening in the last track on the album, “Gimme The Car,” where he begs his dad to lend him the family car so he can have sex with a girl who might not necessarily want to have sex with him. He sings, “I tell ya what I'm gonna do / I'm gonna pick her up / I'm gonna get her drunk / I'm gonna make her cry / I'm gonna get her high,” describing how he plans to lower her inhibitions so he can “touch her all over her body.” Presumably, this girl refuses him, because he ends the song having changed the chorus from, “Come on, Dad, gimme the car,” to “Come on, girl, gimme your… / Cause I ain't had much to live for.” By complaining, “I ain’t had much to live for,” Gano seems to be guilting this woman into giving him what he wants, even though it may not be what she wants.
The largely male critics who continue to praise “Violent Femmes” often commend Gano for being so upfront about his regrettable, but relatable inner dialogue, probably because they haven’t had the sometimes scary experience of being on the other end of someone’s sex drive. Perhaps Gano is more immature than he is creepy, but “Violent Femmes” serves as yet another reminder that cultural touchstones aren’t morally infallible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2018 at 2:03 a.m.
A black Harvard College student was arrested Friday night after a physical confrontation with law enforcement for charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest, according to information posted Saturday by the Cambridge Police Department.
In response to the event, the Harvard Black Law Students Association posted a tweet calling the arrest of the student an incident of police brutality. BLSA also later posted a statement on its website calling CPD's version of events—published on social media—"incorrect." Members of BLSA, who wrote they videotaped the incident, wrote in the statement they saw the student, naked and unarmed, surrounded by at least three Cambridge Police Department officers.
In an unusual move, the police department tweeted a lengthy explanation of the arrest in direct response to BLSA’s tweet.
According to CPD’s tweet, officers arrived at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse at around 9:09 p.m. last night in response to “a call from a woman who stated a male had thrown his clothes in her face” and six other reports of a “completely naked” man.
The CPD wrote in its tweet that officers “located and verbally engaged” the student, who was standing on a traffic island in the middle of Mass. Ave. Officers learned from the student’s acquaintances that he previously “took narcotics,” which “could have a hallucinogenic effect when ingested,” according to the tweet.
The officers and the student then engaged in a physical altercation, according to the tweet from the CPD.
“Numerous attempts made by officers to calm the male down were met with opposition and his hostility escalated while officers attempted to speak with him,” department officials wrote in the tweet. “After he was observed clinching both of his fists and started taking steps towards officers attempting to engage with the male, officers made the tactical decision to grab his legs and bring him to the ground.”
BLSA released a statement Saturday evening stating that the CPD’s accounting of events is “incorrect.” BLSA’s statement, signed by “Concerned Members of the Harvard Community,” states that a number of BLSA members and admitted Harvard students witnessed the incident April 13—an incident the statement calls “a brutal instance of police violence.”
“A naked, unarmed Black man, stood still on the median at the center of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street,” the statement reads. “He was surrounded by at least four Cambridge Police Department (CPD) officers who, without provocation, lunged at him, tackled him and pinned him to the ground.”
“While on the ground, at least one officer repeatedly punched the student in his torso as he screamed for help,” the statement continues.
The CPD tweet states that three officers from Cambridge Police and another officer from Transit Police “were required to gain compliance from the male” and place him in handcuffs.
The student was subsequently transported to a local hospital for an evaluation, and, while in transit, spat “a mixture of blood and saliva at an EMT,” according to the tweet.
The BLSA statement notes that “a pool of blood remained on the pavement” as the ambulance departed.
The student is currently under arrest and is facing charges of “Indecent Exposure, Disorderly Conduct, Assault, Resisting Arrest, and Assault and Battery on an Ambulance Personnel,” according to the CPD tweet.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick elaborated on the department’s account of events in an emailed statement Saturday afternoon.
“Once on the ground, the individual party had pinned his arms under his body making it difficult for officers to handcuff him,” Warnick wrote. “Physical force was used to unpin his arms and gain compliance in order to handcuff the party.”
Late Saturday night, Warnick emailed The Crimson a copy of the full police report detailing the sequence of events Friday. The report elaborates on the account of events presented in the tweeted statement.
“We informed him that we were only there to help him and were concerned for his safety,” reads a portion of the report, written by one of the officers involved. “It was made very clear that our pleads were not going to be received.”
The reports adds that the student’s behavior became “aggressive, unreceptive, and intimidating almost immediately.”
After assessing that the student “could not be reasoned with,” one officer grabbed the student’s legs in order to bring him to the ground, according to the report.
Unable to pry the student’s “hands from underneath his body, I delivered approximately 5 strikes with a closed fists to the area of his stomach,” the report reads. “These seemed ineffective.”
In a statement sent to Cambridge City Councilors following the arrest, Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. described the arrest and specifically discussed the five punches the CPD officer delivered to the student's stomach. Bard wrote he had received questions and concerns from "select members of the community" and that "the primary concern" centered on these punches.
"In a rapidly-evolving situation, as this was, the officers primary objective is to neutralize an incident to ensure the safety of the involved party(ies), officers, and members of the public," Bard wrote. "To prevent the altercation from extending and leading to further injuries, particularly since the location of the engagement was next to a busy street with oncoming traffic, the officers utilized their discretion and struck the individual in the mid-section to gain his compliance and place him in handcuffs."
The BLSA statement argues that other Harvard resources should have “been mobilized to come to the student’s aid prior to CPD getting involved.” In particular, the statement notes that Harvard University Health Services were contacted first—but that HUHS transferred the callers to CPD.
The department failed to “appropriately respond to the individual needs of the person concerned” by “resorting to violence unnecessarily and with impunity,” the statement reads. The statement further states that HUHS put the student “at great risk of being killed by the police” by choosing to involve CPD.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said Saturday that HUPD was “aware” of the call.
“Officers responded, but when they arrived the suspect was already under arrest,” he said.
The BLSA statement makes several demands in the wake of the incident, including that the officers involved in the arrest be “investigated and held accountable” and that Harvard create an “internal crisis response team to support” affiliates that “does not involve CPD.” The statement calls on Harvard to offer “support from the school, fellow students and our instructors” to “put pressure on the CPD” to comply with BLSA’s demands.
The statement further demands that CPD respect the rights of civilians to record police conduct. CPD’s own policies recognize that individuals have the “right under the First Amendment to openly record police activity in public in a peaceful manner,” according to the statement.
“It was clear to our Harvard BLSA members that CPD officers were not following these procedures,” the statement reads. “But for our members’ persistence in defying police attempts to obstruct videotaping this incident, there would be no record.”
A Harvard Law student tweeted out what appeared to be a video record of the arrest over the weekend, but later deleted that video.
The BLSA statement calls CPD’s conduct on April 13 “unacceptable.”
“We are reminded, as soon-to-be-graduates of an elite law school that we cannot protect our bodies with our degrees—and that is why we also call our current students and alumni to embrace these demands as inclusive to all Black people, not just Harvardians,” the statement reads.
The statement notes the April 13 incident has "broader political implications" for students and for Bostonians. The statement explicitly states, though, that BLSA is not "contextualizing this event in the broader instances of police violence" out of respect for the privacy of the victim and his family "at this time."
CPD plans to hold an “internal review” of the incident given “use of force was required to gain compliance” from the student to “avoid further injury to himself,” according to the police department’s tweet. The review will be conducted by the department’s leadership and by its Professional Standards unit, according to the tweet.
As a matter of policy, CPD conducts such internal reviews whenever officers use force.
"Because the police department carries an affirmative burden to demonstrate that the exercise of force was necessary and appropriate, the department must conduct a complete and thorough review of all such incidents," the department's 2011 policy reads.
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a statement to City Councillors over the weekend that he believes the outcome of the review will allow CPD to learn "lessons" from the arrest.
"I await the outcome of the internal review and analysis of this incident by the Professional Standards Unit," DePasquale wrote. "I have great faith in Commissioner Bard and the men and women of Cambridge Police Department and I am confident that they will use this as an opportunity to reflect on lessons that can be learned from this incident."
"I know that the Cambridge Police Department takes great pride in serving and protecting the City of Cambridge," DePasquale wrote.
Roland S. Davis, the College's associate dean for diversity and inclusion, addressed the incident in an email he sent to College students Saturday afternoon.
"Please know that our primary concern is for the student's well-being and privacy, and that we will be working with them and their family to attend to these needs," Davis said. "However, we are very much aware of the wider societal backdrop in which this has happened, and want to acknowledge that this incident may be upsetting to many of you."
Davis held a gathering for College affiliates Saturday afternoon at 4 p.m. in the Phillips Brooks House Parlor Room.
BLSA held a gathering in Wasserstein Hall at the Law School at 5:30 p.m. Saturday evening to discuss the incident.
Friday’s incident coincided with the night of Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor spring concert.
University spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University is "aware of the forcible arrest of a Harvard student by the Cambridge police department last night."
"We are concerned and gathering information about the facts and circumstances leading up to the arrest and understand that the city of Cambridge is reviewing the situation," she wrote. "University officials are also working, as they always do, to care for and support our students."
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 14, 2018
A previous version of this story indicated Harvard Black Law Students Association had released a public statement in response to the Cambridge Police Department's lengthy explanatory tweet and quoted some erroneous information contained in that statement. In fact, the document originally referenced in this story was a draft letter being circulated internally by BLSA; the draft contained some incorrect information regarding CPD's videotaping policies. CPD does not, in fact, have a policy requiring its officers to wear body cameras. After BLSA released its official statement Saturday evening, Crimson editors updated this article with the final statement.
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article embedded tweets from the Cambridge Police Department, the Black Law Students Association, and Harvard Extension School student Ernest Owens, who tweeted out an internal draft of a BLSA letter responding to the incident. The Crimson has decided to remove the embedded tweets from the article out of concern for the privacy of the student involved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2018 at 11:01 p.m.
Harvard has raised $9.1 billion as part of its ongoing capital campaign as of March 31, according to a dean of the University and multiple alumni who attended a celebratory event in Sanders Theater Saturday afternoon.
At least seven alumni exiting Memorial Hall Saturday said University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 announced the University had raised more than $9 billion to a crowd comprising donors, professors, and high-level administrators. All of Harvard’s schools have now met their individual campaign goals, multiple people leaving the event said.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences specifically raised $3 billion dollars, a speaker at a luncheon in Annenberg Hall Saturday told attendees gathered to celebrate the FAS campaign.
Donors Michael T. Kerr ’81 and Peter L. Malkin ’55 said the Faculty of Arts and Sciences $400 million fundraising goal for undergraduate house renewal remains unfulfilled, however. Lowell House is currently in the midst of renovations as part of Harvard’s ongoing $1 billion House renewal project, and Adams House is slated for renewal next year. Several other houses have yet to be renovated.
Kerr said he expects many alumni will contribute to this particular initiative as their own House comes up for renovation, even if they have not yet donated to House renewal.
“We are grateful for the generosity of our alumni, donors, volunteers, and the greater Harvard community who have  made it possible for us to reach this milestone,” Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 wrote in an emailed statement Saturday. “The Campaign has expanded access to education; fueled a campus transformation on both sides of the river; advanced critical research and applied work in science, public health, policy, education, and the arts and humanities; and fostered examination and understanding of cultures and values.”
Harvard launched its capital campaign  in 2013 with a goal of $6.5 billion, which it passed in April 2016, breaking a higher education record in the process. That record was previously held by Stanford University, which raised $6.2 billion in its last fundraising drive.
As of June 2017, Harvard had raised $8 billion with a year left in the campaign.
University President Drew G. Faust gave a speech at the event; attendee P. Kent Correll ’76 said she spoke “brilliantly” summarizing her 11 years at Harvard’s helm. The capital campaign—one of the hallmarks of Faust’s tenure—wraps up as she prepares to leave office. Lawrence S. Bacow, who currently sits on the Harvard Corporation, will take her place in July.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, University Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana, and Harvard Corporation senior fellow William “Bill” F. Lee ’72 also attended the event.
At an earlier Celebration of Scholarships dinner Friday evening, a speaker at the event confirmed the College has reached its $600 million scholarship fundraising goal, according to multiple alumni who attended the Friday dinner. The Crimson first reported Harvard had reached its financial aid fundraising goal in March.
Undergraduates receiving financial aid attended the dinner Friday, where they dined on steak and potatoes—many eating alongside the donors who endowed the specific scholarships those students received.
Other speakers at the Saturday event included Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, and a number of professors.
Rogers wrote that the University will continue to solicit donations in the months to come.
“As we enter the final months of the Campaign, we will continue to work with our community to build support for existing and emerging priorities,” she wrote. “Harvard remains steadfast in its commitment to a better Harvard and a better world—and the success of the Campaign helps make this commitment possible.”
The sciences will be a significant focus of fundraising efforts after the campaign concludes just over two months from now, according to Kerr, who attended an event for donors Smith hosted in March.
The campaign officially concludes June 30, and Kerr said he expects many alumni to continue donating through reunion season in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2018 at 2:05 a.m.
In the wake of the forcible arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate Friday, hundreds of University affiliates came together at multiple events held across campus to talk through the incident and to share their concern and support for one another.
Cambridge Police Department officers arrested a Harvard undergraduate Friday night after a physical encounter with law enforcement on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault. Shortly after the incident, the Harvard Black Law Students Association tweeted out a statement calling the arrest an instance of police brutality. CPD later publicly issued its full version of the arrest; BLSA wrote in a statement Saturday evening that CPD’s accounting of events is “incorrect.”
Hours after news of the student’s arrest became public, administrators and student groups including BLSA mobilized to organize meetings to help affiliates process the event. College officials held one meeting, BLSA held another, and multiple House Faculty Deans and tutors hosted gatherings in House spaces throughout the day Saturday.
Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair co-hosted an event Saturday afternoon in the Phillips Brooks House parlor room for students across campus to “come together and be in community with one another” in response to the arrest, according to an email Davis sent to students Saturday.
Roughly 50 individuals attended the gathering, which was off-the-record. Attendee Naomi P. Vickers ’21 said in an interview after the event that she hopes Harvard will take “concrete steps” to ensure local institutions like Harvard University Health Services, the Harvard University Police Department, and CPD protect students. Many people left the event visibly upset.
“I think they tried to accommodate our thoughts, but what will be productive is getting all involved parties in a room to discuss students’ needs,” Vickers said of the gathering.
O’Dair said after the event that she recognizes some students are dissatisfied with the University’s procedures for responding to student health issues.
“I really hear the students when they say they don’t trust the systems here,” O’Dair said.
HUHS received a call about the student Friday night but HUHS staffers redirected the caller to CPD, according to BLSA’s statement. HUPD was also made aware of the incident Friday night but CPD officers had already arrested the student by the time HUPD officers arrived at the scene Friday night, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said in an interview Saturday.
Davis said after the gathering he is satisfied with the way students responded throughout the discussion.
“I am sad that this tragedy happened, but glad and proud of the way the Harvard community is responding and hope we can make progress towards meeting the students’ needs as well,” Davis said.
Shortly after the meeting in the Phillips Brooks House, BLSA held a similar off-the-record event in the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall, attended by more than 150 people.
BLSA hosted the meeting to update Harvard affiliates about what happened Friday and to provide students a place to heal and work through the arrest, according to BLSA member Emanuel Powell III. He specifically credited black women involved with BLSA for their participation in the event, noting the women facilitated conversation and ensured the gathering served as a “space of healing.”
“What we had here today was about people coming together in tears, but also a type of joy that was around, ‘How do we fight so this doesn’t happen again?’” Powell said. “You don’t hear that so often, this part of the story—the people who in their anger actually find love for each other.”
BLSA member Amber A. James ’11, who spoke at the event, said she agrees with Powell and that she thinks the meeting served a key function in allowing Harvard affiliates to “[build] for the future.”
“I think of this meeting as both crisis response to the specific incident that happened and also coalition building and healing and establishing a foundation for the work that will continue to be done, the healing that will continue to happen in order for us to process, and the relationships that will continue to thrive and grow in spite of incidents of oppression and state-sanctioned violence,” James said.
James, who was present during the arrest, said the gathering Saturday gave her a platform to tell event attendees what she witnessed.
“It was incredibly important for this space, the Harvard Law School community, the broader Harvard community, the broader Cambridge community to hear from what people actually witnessed, not the warped version of the story, the self-serving version of the story the police will tell,” James said in an interview after the gathering. “You can’t call me a liar if I tell you what I saw with my own eyes.”
“So I really wanted to make sure that people had the opportunity to hear first-hand,” she added.
Attendee Che R. Applewhaite ’21, who identified himself as an international student of color, said what he called the University’s lack of action regarding the arrest made him feel unsafe.
“There have been ways in which the University could've prevented something like this from happening, and those things not actually being done,” said Applewhaite, who is comping Fifteen Minutes, the Crimson’s magazine.
Anselm Kizza-Besigye ’21, who said he is helping organize undergraduates’ collective response to the arrest, said after the BLSA event he thinks the University should have done more to protect the student involved in the incident. Kizza-Besigye is also comping Fifteen Minutes.
“As I’ve learned more about what’s happened, it’s just become more obvious to me that there is an acute and systematic failure on almost every level of administration to secure black lives on this campus,” he said. “When we talk about how the Cambridge Police Department responded to a medical emergency on a campus, that is absurd and it’s indicative of a much larger issue in which people don’t understand the implications of calling the Cambridge Police in a non-threatening situation.”
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale wrote in a statement to Cambridge City Councillors that CPD is committed to just and legitimate policing.
"I know that the Cambridge Police Department takes great pride in serving and protecting the City of Cambridge," DePasquale wrote. "They are committed to ensuring legitimacy and procedural justice in their policing efforts."
As mandated by CPD policies, CPD plans to conduct an internal review of the event in the wake of the arrest. DePasquale wrote he is confident that CPD will use the review "as an opportunity to reflect on lessons that can be learned from this incident."
Kizza-Besigye added he does not think the University does enough in general to protect its black students.
“I don’t feel safe on this campus. Ever,” he said. “I don’t feel safe walking alone here.”
Catalano did not respond directly to a question asking about black students’ safety on campus.
When asked to respond to students’ criticisms, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to several diversity initiatives the College recently undertook, including the fact that Davis was recently elevated to the position of associate dean, the fact that the College recently renovated Grays Hall to provide a space devoted to equity, diversity, and inclusion, and the fact that administrators moved the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion offices—formerly at 7 Linden St.—to centrally located Harvard Yard.
Several Faculty Deans sent emails to students in their Houses following the arrest Friday. Some announced they plan to hold House events to discuss the details of the incident and to offer students a space to respond and reflect.
In an email to Winthrop House residents sent midday Saturday, Winthrop Faculty Deans Stephanie Robinson and Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.—who serves as an advisor to BLSA—wrote they plan to provide students with a place to share their thoughts about the arrest.
“Winthrop House will provide a space for students to process the incident itself, as well as the broader issues implicated by this particular incident,” Sullivan and Robinson wrote. “We will be in touch soon with specifics, but we want our community to know how deeply concerned we are and that we are committed to listening to your concerns and thinking with you about solutions.”
Faculty Deans and House staff for Adams House, Currier House, Dunster House, Eliot House, Kirkland House, Quincy House, Mather House, and Pforzheimer House later sent similar emails.
Pforzheimer and Dunster staffers hosted open discussions Saturday evening. Adams and Currier administrators will hold similar gatherings in coming days.
Some student groups also organized conversations following the incident. Marcus K. Granderson ’18—president of  Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, a choir and cultural group that performs music of the African diaspora—sent an email Saturday to members of Kuumba inviting them to a discussion at the building that houses the Signet, an undergraduate arts society. He wrote the conversation will “continue indefinitely.”
Kizza-Besigye said undergraduates will continue meeting and planning a response to the arrest in the days to come and that College students will collaborate with BLSA as part of these efforts.
“Black students on this campus are organizing,” he said. “I don’t know specifically what next steps are because we need to think about respecting the victim of this action, but we’re absolutely not going to let this happen idly and we’re going to keep organizing such that Harvard has to hold itself accountable for systematic failures.”
“Our primary focus in terms of next steps is to ensure that the victim of this action receives every resource that Harvard has to offer,” he added.

Congratulations, Class of 2022. You did it. After 13 years of brutal education and more hours invested in extracurriculars than sleep, you made it to Harvard. After you take your first steps past the regal arch of Johnston Gate, suitcase bouncing on the bricks behind you, you’ll have three days of Visitas to test Harvard’s waters, explore what this campus has to offer, and decide whether you can see yourself here for four years.
We remember this excitement. We were once in your shoes. The prospect of college independence and no parental supervision is a rush of adrenaline...which is why, as veterans of Visitas, we have some advice to give you. Prefrosh, for your sake and ours, don’t be dumb. Here are some tips on getting through Visitas and preparations for your first year without too many regrets.
Don’t destroy your liver
We get it. A college party is exciting, uncharted territory, and you want to make the most of it. But you do not want your first experience on Harvard’s campus to be marked with a trip to the hospital at Mt. Auburn. Trust us, there will be plenty of opportunities to drink and make bad decisions here, but save that for after you commit and have Harvard’s Amnesty Policy on your side.
Don’t be disruptive
Visitas may be a new and exciting time for you, but remember it’s still (perpetual) midterm season for students here. Explore our beautiful libraries and aesthetic study spots to your heart’s content, but keep the volume and activity levels to a minimum. However Instagram-worthy Harvard’s nooks and crannies may be, it’s still a school, not a museum.
Don’t flex your college acceptances
Yes, you got into Yale. We know you have a laundry list of other schools you’re “considering,” but it’s not worth bragging about unless you want to be branded as the pretentious kid. Use this time as a chance to learn more about Harvard, not as an opportunity to boast about your other acceptances, or—Drew Faust forbid—your SAT score. You’ll come to realize that only one school matters in the end.
Don’t touch John Harvard’s foot
Just don’t do it. You can take a picture with the guy. Just stay away from his foot. You’ll understand later.
Do reach out and talk to current students
While it can be tempting to stay within the #squad you formed within the first two hours of Visitas, don’t be afraid to get to know current students at Harvard! Whether it’s your host, your host’s friends, or upperclassmen you run into, we’re all excited that you’re here. Not only can conversations with current students help you determine whether Harvard is the best fit for you, but those connections will make the transition into freshman year a lot easier.
Visitas is completely what you make of it. You can love it or hate it, but what you take away from the experience is entirely up to you. Save yourself from an ambulance trip, the dirty looks of stressed students, and the permanent branding of the letter “A” (for bragging A-hole),  and you just might find your future home here.
