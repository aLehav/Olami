After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are more than a few articles I could write about Amy Winehouse. I could tell you how “Tears Dry on Their Own” walked me through my first legitimate heartbreak, or how I’m convinced that her Virgo star sign was a pretty unironically important part of her artistic career. That “Rehab,” in retrospect, was a song that she probably shouldn’t have had to sing in the latter part of her life, or how she spurred my fascination with the 27 Club, a group of musicians who died too young. This essay isn’t really about any of these things.
The short version of my thoughts on Amy Winehouse is that all she ever wanted was to be loved, but instead was used and manipulated. Watch Asif Kapadia’s 2015 documentary “Amy” once, and it’s clear that her father’s love was a conditional sentiment contingent on her success and that her ex-husband’s decision to leave her came nothing short of ultimate betrayal.
I often try to portray my love for Amy Winehouse as something very distinct from that of the ones who hurt her the most. Recently, I’ve been thinking of the fans who booed her offstage for performing inebriated, the tabloids photographing her bloody arms after her post-rehab relapse. I recall the TV show hosts who gawked at her frail, bulimic frame, comparing her to a horse. As fans, we cry out in protest that we would never be like that, because we love her. I can’t help but wonder if we loved and continue to love her, or perhaps more accurately fixated on her, not for her talent or her personality, but because she reminds us of a burning house that we can’t look away from.
I tell people, half-jokingly, that, in my past life, I must have been a creative with some serious problems — that this is why I connect so deeply with Amy. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that the form of love I had for her was self-indulgent. It wasn’t that I appreciated the way her voice could captivate a crowd when she sang “Valerie.” Don’t get me wrong, I do love her for that, but there’s a part of me that is mesmerized by the way she laid out her pain for the world to see. I’ve always felt the need to hide the complicated parts of my life, to wrap my experiences up with a pretty bow, but Amy’s were exposed. Whenever I could glimpse some part of her in myself, I felt like I was reading a more complicated version of “Celebrities: They’re just like us! Look at [Oscar-Nominated Actress] waiting in line for groceries!”
For some time, I couldn’t stop consuming this image of the “hurting Amy,” the “heartbroken Amy,” or the “abandoned Amy.” I romanticized the problems she dealt with, which I believed she channeled in her music. And though they were a very real part of her life, I have increasing faith that there were moments of lightness, of love, and of peace that I never accepted as part of Amy Winehouse’s life but were, probably to her, just as important if not more so.
There are arguments as to whether we should love someone “because” or love someone “despite.” You love someone because they remember the stories you told them in passing or can’t help but smile whenever they see a cute dog. You love someone despite the fact that they grind their teeth in their sleep or think being 15 minutes late to everything is socially acceptable. To love “because” is to acknowledge the facets of someone you hope never change. To love “despite” is to know that there are facets of a person that might change for the better (and you want to stick around while they find that new “better”). So what if people love Amy partly because she was suffering and fulfills the archetype of the tortured artist? I project my fears of abandonment onto my interpretation of Amy Winehouse’s life, and I see that my defenses of Amy, of how she deserved more, were often self-gratifying.
There might be a middle ground between loving someone “because” and loving someone “despite.” I haven’t found the right word yet. To love someone “in hopes that”? To love someone “with faith that”? To love someone “accepting that”? I’m trying to figure out how to acknowledge the suffering that Amy Winehouse went through without letting it consume her remembrance whole.
For me, this means listening to her voice in a different way. It means uncovering the ways she played with her voice at live performances to peak out bits and pieces of herself. It means finding all her different renditions of “Valerie” and discovering that her favorite was the original, “Valerie (‘68 Version”), not the ones she recorded for “Back to Black” or with Mark Ronson. I hope that the next time you want to listen to Amy Winehouse, you’ll consider how you might listen to her in a new way. I promise the experience will not disappoint.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There stood a naked young boy with the wings of an eagle, holding arrows of love, destined for the aching hearts of lonely individuals everywhere. The V formed by the arrows and the tip of his left wing point directly at his genitalia, an indication of the sexually playful undertones of this piece. The fallen violin, lute, and open compass further convince the viewer of Caravaggio’s subtle emphasis of the V, a reminder of carnal pleasures. And with Cupid captured in an awkward yet potentially classically inspired position, Caravaggio’s “Love Conquers All (Omnia Vincit Amor)” captured my attention due to its secular depiction of Cupid in the era of the Catholic Counter-Reformation.
Initially, it might seem that “Love Conquers All” puts it all out there and that his piece isn’t an enigmatic mystery requiring an understanding of Vincenzo Giustiniani, the commissioner of the piece, or an understanding of his rivalry with Giovanni Baglione. If you look closely enough, observing this playful young Cupid and his surroundings with enough attention, you just might be able to draw your own conclusions on Cupid’s true nature. There’s a basic meaning that all viewers can grasp from this masterpiece.
Yet a part of this piece’s real splendor lies in the subtle connections it draws to other pieces of art. Is that black armor besides Cupid’s feet from another of Caravaggio's paintings? The soldier grabbing Jesus by the arm in the “Taking of Christ” dons a cuirass of the same shape and color. What about the lute’s uncanny resemblance to that of Caravaggio’s “Lute Player,” painted nearly half a decade before? Are they in fact the same lute? We may never know for sure, but certainly his piece drew me in, made me think about his other pieces, and allowed me to better understand him as a painter. To understand a piece at its deepest levels might just require more than an eye for detail.
As a result, for me, viewing art has always been treacherous: It felt like a scholar’s activity, trying to understand the hidden meaning behind layers of paint upon a single canvas. My fairly limited knowledge of Caravaggio far exceeds my knowledge for any other artist, and certainly without it, I couldn’t have drawn those connections. What purpose do we have for viewing art when grasping for understanding is so daunting and academic?
Ultimately, Baglione’s “Sacred Love and Profane Love” convinced me that viewing art in museums isn’t meant to be a complex, scholarly endeavor, but a straightforward one. Seeing “Sacred Love and Profane Love” immediately after Caravaggio’s “Love Conquers All,” it almost seemed like Caravaggio’s Cupid lies at the mercy of Baglione’s “Sacred Love” — one love conquering the other. One might second-guess themselves if that connection really exists or if both pieces just happen to employ similar-looking models. But that connection is precisely what these two pieces urged me to make: Baglione’s piece, painted just months after Caravaggio’s, is meant precisely to remind the viewer of Caravaggio’s masterpiece — if anything, it is a mockery of Caravaggio’s work.
But more generally, entering a museum and seeing a list of paintings from their gallery, I couldn’t possibly know enough history about every piece to identify artistic rivalries, remember commissioners, and know underlying relationships between paintings — but that’s precisely the point of a museum. Museums bridge the gap in understanding so that I, as a viewer, can intuitively draw connections, recognize similarities, and draw conclusions. Curatorial teams have devoted hours to perfecting the experience for every viewer.
At the Gemäldegalerie, a museum in Berlin, I found both these works juxtaposed, deliberately placed within view of each other for the museumgoer to see their relationship. There’s an additional layer of depth I might never fully appreciate, but I know that if I look closely enough, observing the piece down to its brushstrokes and being careful to look at paintings in the context in which they are placed, at least I’ll see something. An art piece in a museum is meant to be an experience built around the viewer: For a basic understanding, our eyes are enough.

I consider myself an expert in unrequited love. Frankly, I enjoy it: the stress of trying to hide my affections, the butterflies in my stomach whenever I talk to a crush, the fantasies of a first date. I’m still waiting for my seventh grade crush to fall in love with me, even though we’ve barely talked since then. I deserve an Olympic medal in pining, or at the very least, a Girl Scout badge. Likewise, I prefer my love stories to be full of longing. For me, romance is best when drawn out, but most of the rom-coms I watch manage to blow through a whole relationship in under two hours. It’s horribly disappointing. That’s why I was delighted when “Good Omens,” an Amazon Prime miniseries based on the book by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, came out this summer. The show manages to prolong a will-they-or-won’t-they situation beyond belief. Two hours of pining? Ha! Try 6000 years.
In case you haven’t yet had your emotional stability ruined by the show’s display of yearning, “Good Omens” is about the apocalypse. Except in this iteration, the Antichrist, whose arrival signals the beginning of the end times, is an eleven-year-old boy, and the opposing representatives of heaven and hell who were supposed to influence him to choose the right side realize, with five days left until Doomsday, that they’ve been fighting over the wrong kid. Hijinks ensue as the angel, Aziraphale, and the demon, Crowley, attempt to find the true Antichrist, and maybe even stave off the end times. Aziraphale and Crowley do all this while having had crushes on each other since the very first days of creation. For a show supposedly about the apocalypse, it’s really more concerned with what it means to be in love with your best friend, who just so happens to be your enemy in the battle for eternity.
Of course, not everyone wants to read Aziraphale and Crowley’s relationship as a love story. Gaiman, who wrote the scripts, has stated many times that, despite the characters being played by two men (Michael Sheen and David Tennant), the angel and the demon are actually agender, asexual, supernatural beings, and therefore it’s a story about friendship, not romance. But as this excellent article makes clear, there’s no way Aziraphale and Crowley aren’t in love; there are simply too many nods to it in the book and on the screen. Even Gaiman hasn’t been able to avoid stating that “lots of people have chosen, not unreasonably, to ship [Crowley] with Aziraphale.”
Despite Gaiman’s mixed messages, “Good Omens’” third episode does a thorough job of fleshing out Aziraphale and Crowley’s love story. In a 30-minute long cold open, we see them fight and flirt and fall in love through the ages. They meet in the Garden of Eden, reconvene at Jesus Christ’s crucifixion, attend an early performance of “Hamlet,” go out for crepes during the Reign of Terror, and break up a Nazi smuggling ring together, all while debating the ineffability of God’s plan. Both are concerned about their roles in the coming apocalypse—they’ve become fond of humanity. Crowley decides he wants to skip the final blowout completely, and spends much of the 19th century begging Aziraphale to give him some holy water, a demon’s equivalent of hemlock.
Finally, in 1967, Aziraphale gives in and hands over a thermos full of the stuff. A grateful Crowley offers to take him out to dinner at the Ritz, drive him home, whatever. But Aziraphale, who, by my count, has spent the past 5,971 years pining after Crowley, shakes his head. “You go too fast for me, Crowley,” he says sadly.
To a certain corner of the internet, this statement was cause to go absolutely nuts. Nearly 6000 years of us-against-God’s-ineffable-plan, and Aziraphale thinks dinner at the Ritz is moving the relationship too fast? Has there ever been better evidence that queer cinema is fundamentally about repression and yearning? Aziraphale’s remark is one of the gayest things I’ve ever heard, and I was raised by lesbians.
For the “Good Omens” fandom, Aziraphale’s quiet acknowledgment that he and Crowley want the same thing on different timelines was reason for celebration. “You go too fast for me” has now become a byword for “I love you” among fans. Thousands of people have written fanfics depicting Aziraphale’s pining. These stories revel in the joy that is holding your feelings inside until you think you might burst. They honor the satisfaction created by mooning over a crush until Doomsday (literally), showing, in thousands of ways over thousands of years, that love doesn’t need to be loud to be real.
In the “Good Omens” fandom, I found my people. We like our romance delayed, drawn-out, maddeningly obscured, restricted at every turn. 6000 years of pining is where it’s at. Romance is no fun if it goes too fast.

If you’ve ever listened to the radio in your car or shopped at any department store for longer than you should have, then you’re probably well-acquainted with classic pop love songs — Maroon 5’s “Girls Like You,” Dua Lipa’s “One Kiss,” and Zedd’s “The Middle,” just to name a few.
Sure, they’re fun to sing along to and great for crowds, but most of these songs are formulaic at best — and lazy, unoriginal, and exploitative at worst. It seems as though once you’ve heard one, you’ve basically heard them all.
With services like Spotify and Apple Music, the objective for record labels is increasingly to get a song streamed the most, rather than to make it worth buying. In substitution for quality, we see a growing monotony characterized by a diminishing timbre and range, overused tropes, and overused chord progressions, all of which make songs only superficially entertaining.
Though many habitually turn to pop, listeners who are searching for a meaningful, original love song should put familiarity and catchiness aside. Instead, lyrics can inspire emotion and reflection: The right words to capture a poignant scene or feeling elicit appreciation and awe but are rarely found in pop songs — a study of chart-topping songs found that “lyrical intelligence” has rampantly been on the decline.
In turn, better writing can allow for a more nuanced and genuine experience, as the words you’re singing brim with convincing narratives and complexity. Personally speaking, my favorite band, The Arctic Monkeys, adds a unique sophistication to their love songs through their lyrics. Though their alt-rock discography does not primarily target love, Alex Turner’s attention to lyrics makes each composition a heartfelt experience. In the track “Arabella,” the resonating baseline is complemented perfectly by a detailed description of the singer’s muse: “My days end best when this sunset gets itself / Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side / It's much less picturesque without her catching the light / The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes.” Specificity in writing, though seemingly alienating at first, lends itself more to the appreciation of small moments. Carefully detailing one scene or memory — down to the way a passenger blocks the sun’s light — conveys an admirable vulnerability and wit. Though riding a car is a common experience, framing it in the perspective of an attentive lover imbues the scene with magic.His ed descriptions are simple, yet effective and sweet; rather unlike “Slow Hands” by Niall Horan, that artistically compares “slow, slow hands” with the “sweat dripping down our dirty laundry.”
Lyrics can also speak to the mildly obsessive nature of a relationship. Attachments can be developed not only to someone’s beauty and charm but also to their absence. In “Cornerstone,” Turner sings, “I elongated my lift home / Yeah I let him go the long way 'round / I smelt your scent on the seat belt / And kept my shortcuts to myself.” Missing someone can manifest in unexpected, minute, or even obsessive ways. It’s about more than just missing a sensuous physicality (think of every Drake song involving his longing of “that ass”) or a memorable conversation. It can be about indulging in a silky perfume or the softness of a glance, because missing someone can make you long for the smallest detail.
There’s also something wistful, yet mature, in discussing the ultimate timeline of love. When love loses its glamour, one has to ask: Was it only possible through youth? In “Love is a Laserquest,” Turner takes the liberty to reflect: “Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now / Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet / Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts / With the efficiency that only youth can harness.” He describes the less flashy parts of love that don’t include tire-slashing or angry voicemails. Love, in its earlier stages, is propelled by a youthful energy that is exciting and hopeful. But youth is fleeting and often takes the intensity of emotion with it. But perhaps it’s simply a a hurtful assumption that the narrator (and audience) makes. In any case, there are more nuanced ways of discussing youth than how the Chainsmokers do it in “Last Day Alive”: “Drowning in love affair, The night is young, and we are young”. A few thoughts on how to interpret their youth might make the feeling more convincing.
If you’re looking for love songs in the same place as everyone else, then it’s difficult to discover the nuances worth having. But if you take a spare moment to search for a love song, untangle its truths, and embrace its musicality, then you might just find a love song worth loving.

One of the greatest love songs of all time begins by compressing the human condition into a single word: “pressure.” The eponymous force of nature in Queen and David Bowie’s “Under Pressure” is a powerful one; Freddie Mercury sings that it “burns a building down, splits a family in two, puts people on streets.” The instrumental tracks are upbeat; the opening lyrics suggest doom and gloom; neither feeling entirely captures the point. Though “Under Pressure” has hardly been forgotten, it is rarely remembered as a love song — but it needs to be. We need to hear John Deacon’s bass riff again — ideally without Vanilla Ice coming along for the ride.
Like anyone, I can feel overwhelmed under pressure. Sometimes it comes while staring down the rainbow of death that is my Google Calendar during midterms and concert weeks. Other times, it’s when I encounter a bleak statistic about climate change or poverty. Far too often, we hear rants and chants of hatred and ignorance, whether they be on the news or in front of our eyes. It is even worse to hear pain in the voice of a loved one — or to hear nothing at all. Bowie’s entrance in the song captures the entire feeling in just a few words: “It’s the terror of knowing what this world is about.” These moments of desperation are enough to make anyone feel like they want to “turn away from it all.” While contemplating escape, the song slows down and grows quiet. Bowie and Mercury reflect together that they “sat on the fence, but it don’t work.” We can’t get away; we can’t make it better. “Keep coming up with love but it’s so slashed and torn.” Human beings are obsessed with love. We sing about it. We write essays about it. We pursue it during our waking hours. Yet somehow, love never seems to be winning: If people are so fixated on giving and receiving love, doesn’t it seem wrong that loneliness and pressure dominate our world? Mercury rises to a crescendo. He shows us what his voice can do while lamenting what our endeavors cannot. “Why?” he screams. “Why can’t we give love once more chance?”
Enter Bowie. His baritone voice crests the wave that Mercury created with his falsetto. “’Cause love’s such an old-fashioned word…” We love and seek out innovation and new solutions, but perhaps the ultimate answer is the first one we ever devised. Bowie continues that “love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night.” We keep hearing this theme. Why does a great love song keep reminding us about people on streets? Perhaps every love song should. A thousand pressures are always pushing inward, always making our own lives and our own concerns feel like the only things that matter. Love is the counterbalance; it dares us to look outward. It heightens the intensity and expands the limits of our caring. It is why we march down city streets at noon and why we trudge to a friend’s dorm at midnight. We must love beyond our comfort zones, across every border and barrier that we build. We must care about the people on the edge until there are no edges anymore.
It’s a tall order. The world is getting bigger and hotter. As relationships fray and nations rage, it becomes easier to fold into ourselves. “Love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves.” We need to make “ourselves” a bigger word.
Just like I have felt overwhelmed by pressure, I have also felt overcome with love. Sometimes it comes from the T.F. who stays for hours in a review session, or the conductor who always remembers to tell everyone how beautiful they sound together. It’s the hopeful story in the newspaper; it’s the volunteer who won’t stop working; it’s the hug from a friend; it’s the smile from a stranger. It is among the greatest feelings in the world to realize that someone you know has become one of your loved ones. We need more of that feeling. A good love song can capture it. A great one can inspire it.
“This is our last dance,” Bowie concludes. As we sashay across our lives, some music can bridge our solitude. That is what makes “Under Pressure” an undercover love song — it needs to be shared. I urge you to do just that soon. Maybe you need to share it with one person, maybe a hundred. At the end, as the voices fade into a stream of snapping fingers, you might have been pressed a little closer to whoever listened with you. “This is ourselves under pressure.”
