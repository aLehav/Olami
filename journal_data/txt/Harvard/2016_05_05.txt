After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 5, 2016, at 1:47 p.m.
Three graduate leaders of the all-female Sablière Society have questioned administrators’ actions toward Harvard’s final clubs, accusing them of ignoring the input of female clubs. In an op-ed, published Wednesday in The Crimson, the women also charged that administrators were pushing for final clubs to adopt co-ed policies “primarily as a form of damage control” after a slew of negative publicity.
In an academic year in which final clubs and their membership policies have been the subject of intense scrutiny from both Harvard administrators and the national press, the five all-female clubs have been largely absent from media attention until now. The graduate leadership of the Sablière, or “Sab,” have staked out a position somewhere in between the stances of all-male clubs, many of which have expressed staunch opposition to pressure to go gender neutral, and College administrators who have repeatedly insisted that single-gender clubs move swiftly to widen their membership policies.
The op-ed,  co-written by Sablière graduate president Ariel Stoddard ’10, cultural chair Morgan E. Arenson ’06, and legal chair Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, Sablière leaders, expressed general agreement with the University’s aim of promoting “gender inclusivity” in the historically single-gender organizations, but contended that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and other administrators did not include them in conversations sooner and are failing to consider how co-ed moves could impact Harvard women.
“[F]emale clubs have tried to work with Harvard’s administration to ensure that both men’s and women’s clubs transition safely and that women do not become collateral damage in the transition,” the Sablière leaders wrote. “Harvard has given us no indication it understands these concerns.”
Stoddard, Arenson, and Schraa, a former Crimson News editor, wrote that the administration took too long to include women in meetings they initially held only with leaders of the all-male final clubs. They also expressed frustration that some of the concerns they have raised are now falling on deaf ears. Finally, the op-ed suggested that a “barrage of media attacks” surrounding issues of sexual assault is driving Harvard to “quick-fix solutions” with not enough consideration to how Harvard women could be affected.
Khurana, through College spokesperson Rachael Dane, declined to comment on the Sablière op-ed, continuing a pattern of public reticence surrounding his actions towards the clubs.
Dane sent a statement from Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
“Deliberate and thoughtful approaches to transitions like these are very important, and the safety and wellbeing of students are of utmost concern to the College,” Friedrich wrote. “The College has and will continue to extended offers to meet and discuss the specific situations of the clubs, however, it is up to the clubs to accept those invitations.”
According to Stoddard, Arenson, and Schraa, the Sablière has accepted every invitation to meet that administrators have extended them.
As Khurana, Freidrich, and other College administrators attend meetings with the clubs, University President Drew G. Faust and even the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing body, have also been involved in discussions about the centuries-old institutions and their place on campus.
“I read the op-ed and I was disappointed that the women felt they haven’t been sufficiently consulted,” Faust said in an interview Wednesday. “I know that Dean Khurana has spent a good bit of time with all members of single gender organizations this year and I think their complaint was that only in the past year have they been listened to.”
In an interview, Sablière graduate president Stoddard clarified that her disappointment went beyond exclusion from earlier meetings.
“In the past couple of months when we have finally been brought into this conversation, we feel as though we are not being listened to,” Stoddard said. “So the issue is not that they didn’t involve us two years ago. It’s not that they didn’t involve us five years ago. The issue is that when they did choose to involve us… we feel that we have not been listened to despite the pretense of ‘Oh, we’re having a meeting and would love your input.’”
Stoddard said she and other Sablière leaders have felt they were “having an agenda pushed on us” by administrators at the meetings, adding that she hoped the op-ed would produce a better debate about the place of final clubs on campus.
“I would hope that we hear from Dean Khurana or from one of the other deans or from President Faust and we can have a true conversation about this,” Stoddard said.
The op-ed was centrally concerned with how all-male clubs might make the transition to gender neutral membership. Citing the examples of the Spee and the Fox, two traditionally all-male clubs that added women to their ranks in the fall, Stoddard, Arenson, and Schraa expressed concerns about clubs with all-male leadership and all-male alumni extending invitations to sophomore women.
“These new women members, selected by a pre-existing all-male membership, will lack the benefit of women in leadership positions, who could help develop a truly gender-inclusive culture,” they wrote. “They will also lack a female alumnae base. We have concerns about whether such conditions will be safe and beneficial for women.”
While Harvard’s traditionally all-male clubs have long histories, wealthy alumni networks, and valuable Cambridge properties, the female clubs are comparatively young. The first all-female club, the Bee, for instance, was founded in 1991.  Additionally, most female final clubs have limited access to real estate compared to their male counterparts. Because of this, Sablière leaders wrote, forcing clubs to go co-ed presents “a distinct possibility [that] female clubs will die out.”
“The support systems, safe spaces, and alumnae networks the women’s clubs have been striving to build will disappear,”Stoddard, Arenson, and Schraa wrote. “That strikes us as a tremendous waste, and an ironic one, given Harvard’s stated goals.”
Mergers between all-female and all-male clubs could present an alternative to simply going co-ed, as the Fox and the Spee did. Some male clubs are the result of past mergers between multiple groups. The all-male Phoenix S.K., for instance is an amalgam of three former clubs: the Phoenix, the Sphinx, and the Kalumet. While mergers between female and male clubs have been discussed in the past,  none have taken place yet.
The Sablière leaders’ op-ed comes in the wake of public statements from the then-graduate president of the Porcellian Club and the graduate president of the Fly Club, both of whom were also critical of the administrators’ actions surrounding final clubs this year.
While Khurana and Faust have remained tight-lipped on what may be included in a new set of policies expected to be proposed before the end of this academic year, Schraa and her colleagues had little doubt about one thing when composing the op-ed.
“The three of us are not even thinking in a world where it’s possible to remain single-gender. We’re just making the assumption that it’s not,” Schraa said in an interview.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the future of Harvard’s final clubs uncertain, University President Drew G. Faust again criticized the organizations on Wednesday, calling the “fundamental issue” one of “exclusion and discrimination.”
“There’s a sense that [final clubs] are not available to certain groups of the student body not because of any virtue or accomplishment or achievement on the part of those excluded, but rather because they haven’t had the good fortune to have had certain experiences or origins or genders,” Faust said.
During the past year, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and other administrators have challenged the role of Harvard’s historically all-male and unrecognized final clubs—though there are now some co-ed clubs and clubs comprised entirely of women—in undergraduate life. Earlier this semester, a University-wide task force dedicated to sexual assault prevention released a report castigating the clubs for their disproportionate association with sexual assaults and their “deeply misogynistic” nature.
In particular, the report stated that 47 percent of undergraduate senior women involved in final club activities experienced unwanted sexual conduct during their College career, compared to 31 percent of all female seniors.
Faust articulated criticisms of the clubs beyond their connection to sexual assault on campus, denouncing what she called exclusionary admissions practices. She said final clubs would not qualify for recognition by the College because their membership criteria were not based on measurable talents or abilities.
“To be a recognized organization you have to have a membership that can be based on merit,” Faust said. “It shouldn’t be based on accidents of birth.”
In the past, some students have criticized College administrators for recognizing certain groups that hold competitive comp processes, have largely social functions, and maintain single-gender membership. The Undergraduate Council recently began discussions about whether it should have a role in overseeing comp processes.
Faust said the final clubs’ long history and disproportionate influence on campus social life were particularly alarming, even compared to other similar types of social groups, like fraternities.
“The final clubs have had a focus of concern because they do have a status and an influence on campus that is long-lived… and powerful,” Faust said.
The University task force report also called on Khurana to formulate a plan for the clubs’ future by the end of the semester. Though Faust said the plan was still evolving and did not discuss any details, Khurana has considered potentially barring students in final clubs from receiving fellowships or holding leadership positions such as team captaincies.
As the College has increasingly cracked down on the final clubs, recently, some final club leaders have become outspoken in their criticisms of Harvard.
Last week, the graduate president of the Fly Club called on Khurana to “recuse himself from further discussion” about the clubs and demanded more information about Harvard’s plans for the single-gender organizations. On Wednesday, Faust said Khurana was still formulating his plans and disputed the Fly Club’s characterization of Khurana’s actions.
“I don’t think Dean Khurana has been hiding anything. I think he’s been talking with people in the course of the year in order to develop an approach,” Faust said. “It’s been a matter of interchange rather than he’s been sitting there hiding the ball.”
The 225-year-old Porcellian Club also made a rare public statement condemning Harvard for its approach to the clubs. It also commissioned a statistical rebuttal to the task force report that argued that the survey’s methodology was flawed and its conclusions unsubstantiated. The analysis, conducted by statistical firm Welch Consulting employee Jora B. Stixrud, argued that Harvard conflated correlation with causation with regards to the clubs’ association with sexual assault.
Faust criticized the analysis and said the sexual assault task force report is just one of several sources informing Harvard’s approach to the clubs.
“I think we were pretty clear about a very fundamental reality in statistics which is very rare that you show causation, you show correlation and correlation alerts you to realities that bear further inquiry and consideration,” she said. “That’s very much the attitude that I think was expressed in the analysis of the task force report.”
And on Wednesday, graduate members of the Sablière Society, an all-female organization, charged in a Crimson op-ed that Harvard has left women out of the conversation about the future of the clubs. The graduate leaders argued that Harvard could endanger the existence of the female organizations should it push the all-male clubs to accept women as members.
“I’m sorry they feel that they haven’t had enough voice,” Faust said. “I hope that they come to feel that their concerns and their, I think, different status and different roles on the campus will be attended to as we move forward.”
In his comments last month, Charles M. Storey ’82, the former graduate board president of the Porcellian, said the club’s membership “reflects the diversity of the male population of Harvard College.” While Faust acknowledged that the clubs may count some students of various socioeconomic and racial backgrounds among their ranks, she maintained that their memberships are unlikely to be representative of the student body.
“It’s interesting that their membership lists aren’t public,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior quarterback Scott Hosch was eating in Cabot dining hall when he got the call.
Sliding his phone out of his pocket, he spotted an unfamiliar area code. Even though he was surrounded by lunchtime cacophony, and even though he was in the middle of a conversation with a friend, Hosch decided to grab the phone, touch the screen, and lift the speaker to his face.
That, in short, was how Harvard’s emeritus quarterback learned the news: He had earned a tryout with the Detroit Lions.
“I’ve been playing football since I was six years old,” Hosch said. “If it doesn’t work out, I know I gave it shot and gave it my best….. If I make it, then my dreams come true.”
Two days before and several hundred feet away, senior offensive lineman Cole Toner was lounging in Hosch’s common room with roughly 25 friends and family members when he received a similar call.
Months before, in the fall, Toner had anchored an offensive line that had led the Ivy League in scoring. Throughout the spring, the 6’7” Toner had worked out, practiced his technique, and watched as analysts projected him as a late-round selection.
But sitting in that crowded Cabot common room presented a new kind of challenge. No early-morning workout or late-game situation could prepare a person for that kind of waiting.
Then the Cardinals called. Within seconds, Toner’s grin suggested the outcome, and within minutes, a television screen had confirmed it: “With the 171st selection in the 2016 NFL Draft, the Arizona Cardinals select Cole Toner.”
“I was so happy for Cole when he got drafted because we’ve been working together since he got here in 2012,” senior offensive lineman Anthony Fabiano said. “Seeing all that come to fruition…was just an awesome feeling for everybody surrounding him.”
Over the past week, six Crimson standouts have received such phone calls. Hosch heard from the Lions (a tryout invitation); Toner heard from the Cardinals (a full-blown draft choice); tight end Ben Braunecker heard from the Chicago Bears (a free-agent signing); offensive lineman Adam Redmond heard from the Indianapolis Colts (another free-agent signing); offensive lineman Anthony Fabiano heard from the Baltimore Ravens (a third free-agent signing); and linebacker Jacob Lindsey heard from the Green Bay Packers (a tryout invitation).
That’s a lot of activity, especially for an Ancient Eight program. As of the spring of 2016, the Harvard-to-NFL pipeline is up, booming, and apparently here to stay.
“If you’re talented enough, they’re going to find you,” Redmond said. “We all sat down in August, even before the beginning of the season, and just said, ‘The NFL is just going to happen. Let’s focus on this season here at Harvard.’”
This season marked the first time in recent history that Harvard fielded two players who were projected as official picks. Besides Toner, Braunecker featured prominently on several analysts’ projections. He led the Crimson in essentially all major receiving categories during the season, and at the Combine, he ranked as arguably the most athletic tight end available.
The Indiana native went home to watch the draft with his family. After suffering through hours of drawn-out television without hearing his name called, he ended up signing with a Bears team that had an expressed need for tight ends.
Redmond experienced a similar narrative. Returning to Ohio to spend the weekend with his family, he was passed over during the actual draft but received a phone call soon after the picks had ended.
The 300-pound tackle battled injuries while at Harvard, and the signing offer came as a validation of sorts.
“It was weird how a few days ago I didn’t really know what was going to happen,” Redmond said. “It goes from zero to 60 pretty quick.”
Joining Redmond in this journey is Fabiano, who had started for the Crimson since his sophomore year. He began his career at tackle before moving to right guard as a junior. Then, during the 2015 season, he switched to left guard.
That versatility evidently appealed to the Ravens’ front office. Baltimore has historically proven to be a kind place for Harvard football stars, as Juszczyk and former All-Pro center Matt Birk both launched their careers in black and purple.
More recently, 2015 senior Nick Easton signed with the Ravens after graduating, giving Fabiano quite the Crimson pedigree to follow.
“I hung up the phone, and my friends went nuts,” Fabiano said. “It was a fun experience for sure, and now it’s time to get to work.”
This year, Harvard’s NFL talent also came from the defensive side, with Lindsey getting a chance to demonstrate his chops at Packers’ tryout. Twice a member of the All-Ivy second team, Lindsey led the Crimson in tackles during both his junior and senior seasons.
Now that the NFL signing frenzy has abated, the six Harvard players face a gauntlet of tryouts, minicamps, and potentially contract negotiations. Toner, Fabiano, Redmond, and Braunecker have comparatively more job security, as all four have won formal contracts. Meanwhile, Lindsey and Hosch are hoping to impress enough to earn this luxury.
For his part, Hosch will fly out to Detroit and battle with other invitees from Thursday until Sunday. Then, returning to Cambridge, he will face a different kind of competition: four final exams.
“I’ll be enjoying the tryout compared to the finals period next week,” the senior noted.
The path is no less taxing for players who have signed already. Redmond, for example, will head to rookie minicamp in Indianapolis only to return briefly to complete classes; later he plans to fly in for a day or two to graduate.
The immediacy of action creates a conflicting sense of nervousness and eagerness—or as Fabiano dubbed it, “excited anxiety.” For these players, lifelong dreams have coalesced into reality, and that reality begins in a matter of days.
Another set of Harvard football players is likely experiencing the same mix of feelings, albeit for different reasons. This year, the NFL Draft coincided with the May 1 deadline for committing to Harvard. Just as one set of players was officially leaving the Crimson program, a new set of players was arriving.
In this way, the wheel keeps turning, and the Harvard roster keeps filling up. Four years from now, it may well be the case that some of these now-fresh rookies will be the ones sitting in Cabot dining hall, stabbing at lunch offerings, and feeling a phone vibrate in their pockets.
“It’s going to help out with the guys coming in, motivating them to work out,” Fabiano said. “We can convince these recruits now for sure that, ‘Hey, you can make it to the NFL from Harvard.’ No doubt about that now.”
