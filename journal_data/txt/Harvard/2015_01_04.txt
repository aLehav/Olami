After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days after the announcement that Harvard Law School had been found in violation of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, student activists and the lawyer behind the original complaint have praised the findings and expressed cautious hope for the future. Law School professors who previously denounced Harvard’s sexual harassment policy, meanwhile, criticized the decision and remain in vocal disagreement with the University’s approach to the issue.
Following a years-long investigation, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced on Tuesday that the Law School’s “current and prior” sexual harassment policies failed to meet OCR Title IX standards; in particular, OCR noted the Law School’s handling of two student complaints and what it described as a lack of adequate training for Law School professors and administrators in their decision. The University and the Law School have entered a resolution agreement with OCR to address the identified shortcomings.
The OCR decision comes just months after Harvard unveiled a new University-wide sexual harassment policy and set of accompanying procedures last July. With those procedures, Harvard adopted a centralized approach to handling sexual assault, creating a central office to investigate all claims of sexual harassment filed against students and adopting the OCR-preferred “preponderance of the evidence” standard for determining guilt.
New England School of Law Professor Wendy Murphy, who originally filed the complaint against the Law School in 2010 at about the same time as a since-resolved complaint against Princeton, said she was not surprised by OCR’s findings, though she added that the investigation spanned far longer than most others.
Murphy said the investigation against the Law School could prove significant for dozens of other higher education institutions across the nation currently under investigation for their Title IX compliance.
“I’m hopeful that, with the ruling against one of the world’s most prestigious universities, a law school no less…that the fact that this is a ruling against Harvard Law School will in and of itself…inspire all other schools to fall in line and to strictly comply with Title IX,” Murphy said.
Murphy added that she believes that the findings of the investigation against the Law School were less harsh than they could have been because the school was credited with resolving some shortcomings through Harvard’s new policy and procedures—changes that Murphy said she believes would not have been crafted if not for her original Title IX complaint and the subsequent investigation.
Murphy’s response to the news stands in stark contrast to what some Law School professors are saying about OCR’s decision and the federal government’s enforcement of Title IX more broadly.
Elizabeth Bartholet, a Law School professor, wrote in an email that the OCR decision “represents nothing more than the government’s flawed view of Title IX law.” She wrote that OCR’s interpretation of Title IX deviates from what she called the “much more balanced” interpretation found in the courts and argued that OCR’s role is not to interpret the law to begin with.
She criticized Harvard for entering the resolution agreement, rather than “stand[ing] up against the federal government.”
Janet Halley, another professor at the Law School, echoed Bartholet’s criticism of the OCR decision, arguing that “We, as a Law School and as a individual members of the Faculty, have nothing to be ashamed of.”
Halley and Bartholet spearheaded the writing of an open letter from more than two dozen Law School professors published in The Boston Globe in October that criticized Harvard’s new University-wide sexual harassment policy and procedures, alleging that they are biased against the accused. Discontent among Law School faculty members over the University’s central framework led to the adoption of new Law School-specific procedures that await OCR’s approval.
Student activists, meanwhile, lauded Harvard’s agreement with OCR. Jessica R. Fournier ’17 and Julia R. Geiger ’16, organizers for Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate activist group, said they were pleased with the conclusions of the Law School investigation. They added that they hope changes in staff training and policy clarity—terms of the resolution agreement in the Law School case—will make their way to the College, which is currently under investigation for its own Title IX compliance.
Further impact of OCR’s findings at the Law School are still pending, as Harvard and the Law School still must make Title IX policy and procedural changes, as required by the resolution agreement. Murphy said she will be waiting to see how the Law School and University respond to the agreement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a new year, but the No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team brought the same skills back to the ice as it defeated Brown in a shutout on Friday at Meehan Auditorium in Providence.
The Crimson (7-2-2, 6-1-1 ECAC) opened 2015 by extending its winning streak, outskating the Bears (4-10, 1-6 ECAC) in the first Ivy League game of the year to a 6-0 win. This was Harvard’s first time taking the ice since Dec. 6.
"We only had a week prior to this game that we've been together, so we were pretty nervous coming into the game," sophomore forward Sydney Daniels said. "Overall I don't think it tampered with our performance too much."
Nerves aside, the Crimson dominated on the ice. Daniels led the way for the offense with two goals.
Harvard set the game pace less than four minutes into the first period. Daniels fired a shot off of a pass from senior forward Lyndsey Fry. Brown’s sophomore goalie Monica Elvin deflected the shot, but Daniels was right there for the rebound that put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
"Sydney’s first goal was pretty awesome," junior forward Miye D'Oench said. "She drove to the net hard, took a nice shot, and then got her own rebound, which is always an impressive thing to do. It was the first goal of 2015, so it's just an exciting thing."
Early on in the 3rd period, Daniels extended Harvard’s lead by another point. Senior forward Kalley Armstrong-- who earned her first point of the season with the assist--fed her a pass to the low circle near the slot, where Daniels put one past Elvin.
This was Daniels’ first multi-goal game of her Crimson career. But the rest of the team matched Daniels’ efforts.
"We came out with a lot of energy, and that really helped us," Daniels said. "We had a lot of chances that really generated a lot of momentum for us."
Though Harvard was unable to capitalize on its two power plays, it did earn its first shorthanded goal of the year. Just over four minutes into the second period, junior forward Mary Parker offset a Crimson penalty by taking the puck back up the ice and putting it straight past Elvin.
Senior forward Hillary Crowe rounded out the display of individual effort on the Harvard side. Midway through the third period, Crowe took a pass from freshman forward Haley Mullins around the Bears' goal and drove the puck into the top right corner of the net. This marked Crowe's fourth goal of the season.
D’Oench and freshman forward Karly Heffernan also found the back of the net.
On the defensive side, Harvard held the Bears to just 11 shots on goal. Though it gave up six power plays, the team fought off the one—sometimes two—man advantages to keep Brown off the scoreboard.
"Both penalty killing and power plays are something that we've worked on a lot in practice lately, so it was nice to see a lot of success on the penalty kill," D'Oench said.
Junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer made eight stops during her 40 minutes in goal. Sophomore goalie Molly Tissenbaum also made three key saves in the final period that helped maintain the shutout.
"Starting out with a win, and having such a big win--winning by six goals--is always great," Daniels said. "It gets the season started off on the right foot [and] just makes us even more excited to... prove to people what we're capable of."
With the win, Harvard moves to within three points of Quinnipiac for first place in the ECAC standings. The Crimson also sit three points ahead of Princeton in its quest to earn the Ivy League title.
"Every Ivy game is huge," D'Oench said. "We don't have an Ivy championship or playoffs, so every regular season game counts towards the Ivy title.... As much momentum as you could possibly have going into 2015 is what you need, so I'd say [this] is a really good start."
