After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a recent host on SNL, Ariana Grande proved herself to be a triple threat—great at singing, acting, and now comedic impersonations. In a sketch where she played a lowly Tidal intern named Chloe, Grande displayed her vocal versatility in brilliant impersonations of Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Rihanna, Shakira, and Britney Spears. Her imitations could hardly be more spot-on… which begs the question: Could it be that Grande has been singing vocals for these music icons this whole time?
Grande first hinted at her impersonating prowess back in 2015 on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, when she gave a spot-on impression of Celine Dion’s “Beauty and the Beast.” That video garnered nearly 32 million views on Youtube; this sketch on SNL has, as of publication time, been viewed almost 10 million times and has served as the source material for a plethora of Vines featuring Grande.
What’s more, Grande also delved into actor territory, impersonating Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence in another sketch on SNL. Grande, wearing a blond shoulder-length wig, uncannily resembled Lawrence, adding further fuel to the theory that Grande provides vocals for the young actress. Lawrence herself confirmed that she hated singing. How was it, then, that she sang in the “Hunger Games” series, seemingly so effortlessly, to release hit single “The Hanging Tree?” It’s well known that actors rarely dabble in the music industry successfully. Could it be that Lawrence, too, is a client of Grande’s vocal services?
What does all this mean? Does no one use her own voice anymore? Is Grande’s voice even her own, or has it been reappropriated by the numerous talents she just “impersonated?”
All this speculation might just be a well-hidden, successful publicity stunt meant to bolster interest in “Dangerous Woman,” Grande’s upcoming new album. But these impersonations are too spot-on not to consider this dangerous new possibility.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opening of the Y2Y young adult homeless shelter in December marked a new phase in the continuing effort to combat Harvard Square’s decades-long homelessness challenge. As seen in a recent in-depth article, the shelter has since had a significant impact. Though only a small part of the effort that will be required to combat the immense issue that is homelessness, Y2Y’s successes are a hopeful sign that coupling initiatives like it with larger institutional responses can help solve this deep-rooted problem.
Located in the basement of First Parish Church, the shelter has hosted more than 60 guests since opening last semester. The majority of the young adults, who are allowed to stay for 30 nights at a time, have responded positively to the beds, meals, clothing, and other benefits that the shelter provides. “There’s food whenever you want to eat. There’s showers available whenever you want to shower. It’s basically kind of like a home,” said one guest.
As one of just two youth homeless shelters in the greater Boston area, Y2Y’s success is a great feat. The shelter, founded by two recent Harvard graduates, continues to be operated by Harvard students. “It’s 200 Harvard kids saying, ‘We care. We don’t think that our peers should be homeless,” said co-founder Samuel G. Greenberg ’14.
Yet in spite of Y2Y’s tremendous accomplishments, the limit of students’ ability to fight Cambridge’s homelessness problem has become increasingly clear. The shelter relies on volunteers for almost all of its operations, from cooking meals to cleaning the space. This sort of model is quite effective when students are on campus and available to help, but is more difficult to sustain during breaks when students are not on campus. Of course, this is not to say that students are doing a poor job with the issue. Rather, it is evidence of the inherently limited resources that students are able to contribute on fighting homelessness.
Given the understandable limits on how much students can do to solve the homelessness problem, the responsibility of confronting it in the Square lies with larger, more capable institutions like Harvard. In a survey conducted over one night in 2015, Cambridge’s homeless population totaled 464 individuals, many of whom live in Harvard Square. Providing these Cambridge residents with new opportunities for a better life will be no small feat.
The University and its students should thus continue to support organizations like Y2Y and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. But the University should also contemplate broader action. For example, Harvard could pursue a partnership with the shelters in Harvard Square to create a hiring and job training program targeted at homeless individuals, which would both supplement student work and address one of the root causes of homelessness.
Although Y2Y reflects the potential for students to have a positive impact, it is clear that the problem is much larger than anything that can be solved by students. Lasting  improvements in the situation of Harvard Square’s homeless will require ambitious actions by the University, and by the wider society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, usually-garbage Georgia Governor Nathan Deal surprisingly vowed to veto House Bill 757, which would have given organizations and businesses the legal ability to fire or refuse to serve BGLTQ people out of respect for business owners’ religious beliefs. Still, the bill was able to get past 236 elected officials to end up on his desk in the first place.
Last week, North Carolina’s House of Representatives passed House Bill 2—a law destroying all previous anti-LGBT discrimination laws and prohibiting trans people from using public bathrooms.
Ostensibly, this bill just prevents trans people from using the “correct” bathroom, but let’s call a spade a spade: This isn’t a question of comfort or preference. This is a question of safety. Trans people, particularly trans women of color, are murdered at unfathomable rates, the crimes are not tried as hate crimes, and murderers go free. Bigots do evil things and call it “fear,” call it “invasion,” call it “infringement.” The next time you sit down to write another unnecessary think piece about free speech and “sensitivity” and the encroachment of the ghastly notion of safe spaces, consider what is actually at stake. And by that I mean take a seat.
Now, activists are organizing efforts to convince Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam to veto Senate Bill 2387 and House Bill 2414, which would do much of the same work as North Carolina’s bill, making it (again: Let’s call it what it is) illegal for trans students to use the bathroom in school.
There is a certain feeling of growing up in a place that wants to make your existence impossible.
This is, of course, a story about the south, my home. But it is not just about the south. Self-congratulatory northerners will leap to slay the monstrous bigotry of their neighbors down south when the exact same beast is subletting a whole floor of their decrepit, poorly decorated house.
And lest we forget this place: Four weeks ago, someone tore down an all-gender bathroom sign in Harvard’s Eliot house in a fit of stupid rage. Last semester, I facilitated a discussion on gender and sexuality with the faculty of a house on this campus, and one of the Faculty Deans expressed (out loud!) profound discomfort at the idea of all-gender bathrooms in his house because of his fear that having trans women in bathrooms with cis women would lead to increased rates of sexual assault. A world scholar, a man of the northeast, a man of Harvard.
But you’ve heard this from me before. I didn’t come here to talk about this, again, nor did I come here to mourn another name, to hold any more bones that do not belong to me in my fingers, on my keypad, in my mouth.
I came here to pay a tribute.
Ma Rainey was a professional blues singer born around 1886, often referred to as “The Mother of the Blues.” She got her start in minstrel shows, working with a company that literally had “black face” in its name. I am not one to project contemporary labels and constructs onto non-contemporary historical figures. However, I do feel comfortable saying that Ma Rainey pushed the boundaries of what was an acceptable heteronormative, binary presentation of gender and sexuality in the early twentieth century. She wrote lyrics as bold and unapologetic as “They say I do it, ain’t nobody caught me. Sure got to prove it on me. Went out last night with a crowd of my friends. They must’ve been women, cause I don’t like no men,” referencing a gathering of women at her home that was raided by the police, as was often the legal practice of preventing congregations of “deviant” groups (read: BGLTQ people, black people) during this time period.
Ma Rainey grew up in my hometown. Despite the fact that I spent an entire year of my middle school career devoted to learning “Georgia Studies,” spending entire class periods discussing the various types of black cotton “workers” that created the backbone of the southern economy, (One day my teacher actually brought in raw cotton plant for us to pick and sort. Unfortunately, I am not joking,) I never learned about Ma Rainey in school. I remember there being a small photo of her on the back of my Georgia Studies textbook, though I remember none of the other photos on the book—she must have been calling to me even then. We never talked about her, not in that year or any other year of my public schooling.
There is an active and violent agenda in the south—and in the north, and on Harvard’s campus—that tries to convince people like us that we are new and inconvenient kinds of people. We are so new and inconvenient in fact—and so deviant, and so wrong—that other people and their beliefs and imagined “free speech” determine the terms by which we are allowed to exist. They make it seem like this is a new movement, that this is a new identity, that we and our problems are new, and thus invented, and thus unimportant. And they are wrong.
I cannot know that any young BGLTQ folks from anywhere near back home will ever read this, or if they would even benefit from it if they did. Honestly, I wouldn’t bet on it. So perhaps I am writing this to me.
Maybe if I had known about Ma Rainey when I was a teenager in Georgia, I would have realized that these people were wrong sooner. But I didn’t know. And that was on purpose too. This, for me, at least, is not the “you are not alone” or the trite murmurs of “It gets better”; it is the “you are not alone” of something old and black moving in the thick air that I moved through, too, when I was a beautiful, self-loathing, queer 13 year-old. It is about me coming to college and imagining myself into an academic to excavate proof of my own belonging. It is about the blues, and one moaning, booming voice that bloomed out of the ground right down the street from where my grandma n’em lived. It is about the blues, about a century-old sound demanding: “Prove it on me.”

I write today about history, about legacies, and about our responsibility to our past and our future. On the morning of April 6, I, joined by Congressman John Lewis, will install a plaque on Wadsworth House in memory of four enslaved persons who lived and worked there during the 18th century in the households of two Harvard presidents. I have also convened a committee of historians from our faculty to advise me about other sites on campus that should be similarly recognized as significant symbols of Harvard’s connections to slavery. Next March, with support from the Office of the President, the Radcliffe Institute will host a major conference on universities and slavery, offering a broader exploration of the complexities of our past.
Although we embrace and regularly celebrate the storied traditions of our nearly 400 year history, slavery is an aspect of Harvard’s past that has rarely been acknowledged or invoked. The importance of slavery in early New England was long ignored even by historians, and the presence and contributions of people of African descent at Harvard have remained a largely untold story. But Harvard was directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage from the College’s earliest days in the 17th century until slavery in Massachusetts ended in 1783, and Harvard continued to be indirectly involved through extensive financial and other ties to the slave South up to the time of emancipation. This is our history and our legacy, one we must fully acknowledge and understand in order to truly move beyond the painful injustices at its core. As the late John Hope Franklin, distinguished historian and Harvard Ph.D., put it, “Good history is a good foundation for a better present and future.”
We must explore this past first of all to recognize and honor the place and importance of enslaved individuals in our history. The plaque at Wadsworth will record the names of four women and men, Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba, whose work formed a foundational part of what Harvard was in the 18th century and what it has since become. Until now, these laborers and their contributions, as well as the broader participation of people of color in early life at Harvard, have been all but invisible. The plaque is the beginning of an effort to remember them and our shared history.
There is a second essential purpose in confronting the distressing realities of America’s racial past and Harvard’s place within it. We need to understand the attitudes and assumptions that made the oppressions of slavery possible in order to overcome their vestiges in our own time. It should not be because we feel superior to our predecessors that we interrogate and challenge their actions. We should approach the past with humility because we too are humans with capacities for self-delusion, for moral failure and blindness, for inhumanity. If we can better understand how oppression and exploitation could seem commonplace to so many of those who built Harvard, we may better equip ourselves to combat our own shortcomings and to advance justice and equality in our own time. At its heart, this endeavor must be about "Veritas," about developing a clear-sighted view of our past that can enable us to create a better future.
The past never dies or disappears. It continues to shape us in ways we should not try to erase or ignore. In more fully acknowledging our history, Harvard must do its part to undermine the legacies of race and slavery that continue to divide our nation.

Drew G. Faust is the President of Harvard University.

To the editor:
Prof. Stephen Peter Rosen's recent letter about diversity in Winthrop leads me to highlight two more aspects of Winthrop's diversity. The original article seems to accept an important but fairly narrow understanding of diversity.
Although we are some of the "white males" mentioned in Robert Proctor's original article, as far as I am know, my husband and I were, at the time, the only openly gay couple in the tutor system when we were hired in 2005. Although there was a pair of LGBTQ House Masters at the time, we constituted the full set of gay people in committed co-habitation among that strange species of grad and professional student known as "tutors." And this was more than a year after marriage equality became legal in Massachusetts.
Upon being hired as a couple (by Prof. Rosen, I add), an old friend of mine, who finished his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1961, noted that it was fitting that Winthrop should be the house to hire a gay couple. When he was a grad student, Winthrop was known as the house "open to Romans and Jews" back in the days when other houses commonly discriminated against Jews and Catholics. We felt proud to be part of a tradition of diversity—not only of race but of religion, culture, and sexual minority, too—so proud that we held our wedding reception in Winthrop.

Nathan A. Paxton, who received his Ph.D. in Government from Harvard in 2010,  was a tutor in Winthrop House from 2005 to 2009.

A lawsuit brought against a local Boston union is anticipated to have no effect on the union’s upcoming negotiations on behalf of Harvard University Dining Services staff or its ongoing representation of Harvard Club of Boston employees.
The complaint, filed by the United States Department of Labor, alleges that UNITE HERE Local 26—a Boston-based foodservice and hotel worker union—denied an employee access to contracts with other employers for comparison. The complaint argues that the reported denial of access violated the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which requires employers to provide contracts and other pertinent employment documents to employees who ask for them.
According to the complaint, the union granted an employee unfettered access to other contracts until she campaigned for a candidate running against incumbent union president, Brian Lang, in 2014. In the aftermath, the lawsuit alleges that the worker requested a copy of such contracts and was denied access.
Brian Lang, the current president of Local 26, said that “both the facts and the interpretation of the law are in dispute.”
“It has no bearing on any of our contract negotiations,” Lang added of the complaint. “We are very confident that we’re going to dispose of this expeditiously.”
Local 26 represents hotel and food service workers across the greater Boston area, including Harvard University Dining Services staff and the employees at the Harvard Club of Boston. The University plans to renegotiate contracts with HUDS staff in 2016 and in the interim period, students and workers hosted events that call for favorable health care packages in the negotiation process.
Local 26 is currently engaged in a notably tense negotiation process with the management at the Harvard Club of Boston, which is not officially affiliated with the University.
Diana C. Pisciotta, the spokesperson of the Harvard Club, indicated the Club did not expect the lawsuit to have any bearing on their open negotiations with Local 26.
“The Harvard Club remains focused on arriving at a contract that reflects the respect we have for our team members who are represented by Local 26, regardless of any issues the Local may have with its members,” Pisciotta wrote in an emailed statement. “The lawsuit speaks for itself.”
In February, workers from the Harvard Club staged a Donald Trump-themed rally outside of a Harvard Business School event to voice their dissatisfaction with what they believe has been a futile process. In response, Pisciotta wrote that the organization was “disappointed that Union organizers are focusing energies on false comparisons instead of coming to the negotiating table.”
According to Lang, Local 26 is slated to renegotiate every contract that the union currently holds—approximately 50 contracts—within the span of the next year.

UPDATED: March 30, 2016, at 7:58 p.m.
Harvard Business School graduate and Bain & Company manager Chad Losee will be the next Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid at Harvard Business School.
Losee succeeds Deirdre  C. Leopold, who has acted as the head of Admissions and Financial Aid since 2006. According to the Business School’s press release on the administrative change, Leopold will continue to work at HBS as the director for 2+2 program, a deferred admission option for students in college or in a full-time master’s degree program.
According to Jana P. Kierstead, the executive director of the MBA program, the school interviewed over 100 applicants for the new director position.
“We spent a fair amount of time thinking through what we were looking for. Higher education experience was an important factor, as was an ability to lead a multifaceted organization,” she said.
The Executive Dean Of Administration Angela Q. Crispi emphasized the many components the directorship role encompasses, such as admissions, financial aid, recruitment, and enrollment yield of admitted students.
“Admissions is one of the most important positions at any university because you are selecting a class. In doing that, at the core of the position is working with an admissions board to spot talent,” she said.
Losee is coming to HBS from a management position at Bain & Company’s Dallas office. Since finishing the MBA program in 2013 he has worked closely with senior leadership at HBS on a number of projects, including on the online platform CORe, according to Director of Media and Public Relations James E. Aisner.
According to the press release, Losee spent time as an observer for the HBS admissions board, where he interviewed prospective students during their application process. He was also a Leadership Fellow in the Dean’s Office for a year.
“The decision boiled down to a couple of things,” Kierstead said. “One is Chad’s incredible interpersonal skills—people meet him and feel at once comfortable and confident in him. The other was that his analytic and strategic skills are extraordinary.”
According to Kierstead, since Losee has spent time at HBS as both a student and a staff member, he is very familiar with the school’s “DNA.”
Crispi said she does not anticipate any changes in the way the Business School operates its admissions process, but that under Losee they will “continue to preserve” their method of reaching out to people who want access to an HBS education.
Losee will begin his new role as director in June, after Leopold wraps up the semester with the current MBA class of 2016 and steps down.
Kierstead attributed Leopold’s departure to a natural career change, as she has been in the position for ten years.

UPDATED: April 2, 2016, at 11:20 p.m.
For the past seven weeks, a project has presented 300 Harvard students with a different kind of challenge: to be happy.
The Happiness Challenge is an eight-week event that encourages participants to make small changes to their daily routines in an effort to bring more happiness to campus through better mental and physical health practices.
The Happiness Challenge sends out a weekly email with a new challenge for the week, such as goal setting, time management, and exercising. A student group called the Harvard Happiness Project hosts the challenge, which is part of a larger, multi-campus initiative.
“Instead of rushing to class or a different building, slow down and observe your surroundings,” one of the challenges asks.
Participants can log their activities on the Happiness Challenge website for the chance to win weekly prizes ranging from gift cards to local restaurants and concert tickets.
“The challenges are meant to be simple and hopefully very accessible for students to get involved with,”co-director of the project Julia L. Versel ’17 said.
Alan Castro ’18, a Happiness Challenge participant and winner of last week’s prize, said he has benefited by making a schedule for the day and sticking to it to fit in time for work and the gym.
“It’s just a way to mold your life into who you want to become through changing small habits. I think the Happiness Challenge fills a gap that is not currently served by the courses that you can take,” Castro said. “I think we all want to change who we are, that’s why we’re in college.”
Leslie R. Rith-Najarian’s ’12 began the student group “The Happiness Project” in 2010, and began developing the Happiness Challenge in 2012. The initiative has since evolved into a larger organization which has spread to other campuses.
This April, theproject is partnering with the Harvard Health Advocacy Program to host a culminating event for the challenge, “Happy Break,” a chance for students to relax with friends, music, food, and crafts.
Both organizations seek to better mental health on Harvard’s campus by centering the conversation on happiness instead of focusing on helping students react to negative emotions.
“I think by now just the word itself—mental health—has so much baggage,” said Co-President of the Health Advocacy Program Gita Bhattacharya ’16. “At least at this moment it’s not worth it to try to re-appropriate that word but instead to focus on something that’s inherently positive which everyone can achieve… and that is happiness.”

UPDATED: April 1, 2016, at 8:07 p.m.
Some undergraduates are continuing a push that calls on the College to officially expand gender-neutral housing options to freshmen and make the process easy.
Since 2014, all rising sophomores, juniors and seniors can request gender neutral housing in their upperclassmen Houses.
According to Resident Dean of Freshman for Ivy Yard and liaison to the BGLTQ office Michael C. Ranen, incoming students who would prefer gender-neutral housing must contact the BGLTQ Office and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
“Freshman students can’t choose their roommates, so it makes gender-neutral housing slightly more complicated,” Ranen said. “We work with [those who want gender neutral housing] on individual basis to find what’s best for them.”
Ranen said that while the BGLTQ office and FDO have discussed the possibility of officially adding a gender-neutral housing option to the housing application for freshmen, they have not crafted any immediate plans.
Undergraduates advocating for such a policy argue that administrators should apply consistent policies to the Houses and freshman dorms, but acknowledge extending the option might be currently unfeasible.
“If this is something that upperclassmen Houses are now universally granting, there’s no reason why Harvard can’t adapt its current model to include an option for freshmen as well,” Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said.
Nonetheless, Keith W. Mason, a fellow at the BGLTQ office, said that they work closely with the FDO to ensure that first-year students have their needs met, particularly for those who are non-gender conforming.
“Trans and gender nonconforming students may have needs related to sharing space, such as bedrooms and restrooms, that we strive to address through our continued relationship with the FDO,” Mason said.
Blecher-Cohen pointed to other universities, like University of Pennsylvania, that provide an option for incoming freshmen to easily indicate their interest in gender neutral housing. Administrators then form a pool of students who can be matched to one another.
“Penn has proven that it’s a viable option and those who are interested in gender neutral housing should know it when they come in,” Blecher-Cohen said. “There’s no reason why it should affect Harvard’s housing process.”
Noah R. Wagner ’18, who prefers to use the gender neutral pronoun they and currently lives in a gender neutral double in Quincy, said they would have liked the option of gender neutral housing on the housing application freshman year.
“I think that if it were presented as a option you could check, it would make a world of difference for a lot of people,” Wagner said. “It’s kind of puzzling that the administration thinks it’s more important to consider as a default whether you like listening to country music in your dorm than what genders you want to live with.”
Wagner added that the students may be discouraged from seeking gender neutral housing because they must actively contact administrators.
“It shouldn’t be considered an unusual alternative accommodation but something people could consider for themselves, rather than have to go out of their way,” Wagner said.
Leah U. Rosen ’19, a board member of Queer Students’ Association, said that the lack of the option on the housing form poses an additional barrier for students.
“If you don’t have the option on the form, that is already an eraser. Having to contact the FDO is an added hurdle,” she said.
Incoming freshmen receive housing assignments in August.

This article is the third in a series about sexual assault prevention at Harvard. The first part can be found here, and the second part here.
Harvard, like many colleges, has a troubled history with hard alcohol.
Over the past six years, the College has wavered back and forth on whether to allow liquor at some campus events, creating new policies and, at times, revoking them soon after. In 2010, the College banned hard alcohol at on-campus House formals, extending that ban to formals outside of Harvard’s gates a year later. In spring 2012, though, Harvard overhauled its alcohol policies to enforce greater regulation of overconsumption College-wide, but at the same time reversed its rules on liquor at formals.
Now, after the release of a University-wide sexual assault prevention report, Harvard again has returned to the debate. Stating that “One cannot uncouple the role of alcohol and sexual assault,” the report suggests that a campus-wide restriction on hard alcohol could be on the horizon.
The report suggests Harvard “consider a pilot study of policies to discourage consumption of hard liquor,” though it acknowledges “valid concerns that students in search of hard liquor might be driven off campus to high-risk locations” as a result. Still, the report suggests Harvard could experiment with banning the possession of hard liquor on campus.
The report stated, “Penalties worth studying need not be draconian—the goal is to bias drinking away from its most dangerous forms”
In years past, the rhetoric surrounding alcohol consumption at Harvard has focused primarily on student health and safety. While health concerns have not dissipated, the relationship between alcohol and sexual assault has now become a driving force behind discussion of alcohol consumption at the College.
Indeed, former University Provost and Steven E. Hyman—who chaired the sexual assault prevention task force—noted in a report last fall that alcohol is a “potent” risk factor for sexual assault. In the report, which accompanied the results to a University-wide survey on sexual assault at Harvard, more than 60 percent of surveyed respondents who indicated they had been assaulted by force said that the incident involved alcohol.
Beyond considering a campus ban on hard alcohol, the sexual assault prevention report suggests that students undergo additional and more rigorous education on safe drinking habits, and that the College create alternative events on campus for undergraduates that do not involve alcohol, thus mitigating potential risks for sexual assault.
When crafting their report, Harvard’s sexual assault prevention task force looked specifically at Dartmouth, which in 2015 instituted an unprecedented campus ban on hard alcohol.
In response, College administrators said they did not expect Dartmouth’s new policy to have much effect on Harvard, citing a “different ethos” between the Cambridge and Hanover campuses.
But now, with a similar move proposed in the report, liquor consumption at the College could become a practice of the past.
Hyman said that, although implementation of a policy similar to Dartmouth’s is unlikely, Harvard could still draw lessons from the ban.
“We’re different. We’re a different kind of place,” Hyman said. “I don’t believe that we can just take things away.”
“We can probably still learn something from their experiment,” he added.
For students, a potential hard alcohol ban could be counterproductive and possibly encourage students to socialize at off-campus venues, which the report cites as a potential aggravator of sexual violence. Earlier this semester, staff in Mather House banned hard alcohol consumption in the House’s Junior Common Room, a measure students criticized for its lack of student input and potential to encourage more intense pre-gaming. Just weeks after establishing the policy, administrators eventually called it off.
Al B. Corvah ’18, one of Mather’s Undergraduate Council representatives, said in seeking to prevent sexual assault at the College “outright banning [hard alcohol] would only lead to more smuggling, more concern.” During the short lived ban in Mather’s JCR, Corvah said students snuck hard alcohol to into the House to bypass the policy.
Undergraduate Council parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16 echoed the sentiments.
“What's going to end up happening is that more and more people are going to host social events that are unrecognized on campus, and that in turn encourages further bad behavior,” he said.
Additionally, and more broadly, the report recommends that students and staff across the College receive education on the relationship between drinking and sexual assault. The report recommends that annual student trainings include information on safe drinking procedures, and that streamlined party registration procedures throughout the Houses require party hosts to learn about safe drinking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting next fall, incoming freshmen from some low-income families will be eligible for a yearly $2,000 “start-up” grant in addition to their existing financial aid. This announcement from college administrators Tuesday came with another one: tuition will increase 3.9 percent for the 2016-2017 academic year.
Undergraduates in the Class of 2020 from families with annual incomes up to $65,000, representing about 20 percent of the incoming class, will receive $1,000 at the beginning of each semester of their freshman year.
“We hope these grants will help students be able to engage fully in all that Harvard has to offer as they transition to college and as they plan for the most effective use of Harvard’s many academic resources during the school year and the summer,” University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven said in a statement.
The grant is part of a three-year pilot program, so qualifying freshmen of the Class of 2021 and the Class of 2022 will also receive the grants. Afterwards, the College will assess the impacts of the program to determine whether or not it will be continued, according to Cowenhoven.
“We’re working to remove the financial barriers to education,” Griffin Director of Financial Aid Sally Donahue said in a press release. “We recruit students of talent and focus our financial aid on students who need it. We want every student to fully experience the life-changing adventure that is a Harvard College education.”
Harvard's spending on financial aid has increased over the past several years, according to the Griffin Financial Aid Office. In 2015, the College spent $170 million on financial aid, in comparison to $67 million in 2005.
Under Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative, launched in 2004 by former University President Lawrence H. Summers, parents who earn $65,000 or less are not expected to contribute to their child’s tuition.
Undergraduate Council leaders applauded the new initiative, and said that the new grant would help incoming freshmen adjust to campus life.
“When you’re a freshman and you come in, especially from a low-income background, it can be really overwhelming when your roommates or all your friends are eating out every day, or they’re spending money on going to events,” UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 agreed that the new grants could help alleviate some of the financial challenges that low-income students face.
“While getting into Harvard is need-blind, so few things on campus are,” Banks said. “Social life, and especially your adjustment as a freshman, are very often decided…by your socioeconomic background.”
UC Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19, a first-generation student himself, said the grant would help fill in the gaps in the College’s existing financial aid program.
“[Students on financial aid] still have to pay for books. They still have to cover everyday living expenses, which are even more expensive. They have to cover travel, if they want to go back and see their family,” Bonsall said. “These are struggles that a large number of Harvard students experience every day.”
“I think this is a really great development. I wish that I had had a grant like this to help me out this year,” Bonsall added.
The announcement of the program also noted that the tuition for Harvard College undergraduates will increase 3.9 percent next academic year to $63,025, compared to $60,650 for the 2015-2016 academic year.
The new “start-up” grant comes at a time when college affordability has reached the forefront of national and University politics, as Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and likewise a ticket of Overseer candidates advocate for free college tuition.
Seventy-six percent of last year’s graduating class graduated debt free, according to the announcement. Though the Financial Aid Office’s website states that students “are not expected to take out loans” as part of their financial aid packets, 24 percent of graduating seniors last year did, with a median total amount of $10,900.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four female leaders in the environmental movement shared their respective stories in combatting climate change on Tuesday at the Kennedy School.
The event, organized by the Belfer Center and the the Center for Public Leadership, featured environmental advocacy leaders from the academia, the non-profit sector and the government.
Neenah Estrella-Luna, an assistant teaching professor at Northeastern University pointed out that many prominent environmental groups in the United States have female leaders.
“Historically women have led most social movements, certainly in the United States and definitely around the world,” Estrella-Luna said.
She mentioned the Green Schools Alliance, a network of schools, as an example of an environmental  institution that is led mainly by women.
“It's an extension of women’s historic perceived goal of protecting the family and of protecting the community,” Estrella-Luna said.
Errin Douglas, an organizer of the event, said the choice of the female panelists was inspired by women’s history month. The panelists expanded the event’s topic to a general discussion of current environmental issues due to the diverse audience.
Amy Luers, the assistant director of Climate Resilience and Information at the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy, argued that adapting to consequences of climate change is equally, if not more important, than preventing climate change.
“Most people who think of climate adaptation think it’s giving up,” she said. “When I engage people on the climate and tell them what I do, if they’re interested in the issue, they spark up. Then when I tell them I work in adaptation their face lulls.”
While many climate activists focus on preventative measures, Luers noted the importance of creating more resilient communities.
“The reality is that even with aggressive reductions in greenhouse gases, we will still see climate disruptions for decades to come,” Luers said.
Reflecting on the outcome of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, all of the panelists agreed the creation of the Paris Agreement was an important first step in addressing climate change globally.
Amy Larkin, Vice-Chair of the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on Climate Change said it was “a miracle” for 195 nations to agree on the importance of addressing climate change, but noted that much more work has to be done. She added that even though local actions are important in order to slow the pace of environmental degradation, a global framework is essential.
“It was only a signal. The hard work begins now,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when long-buried legacies of racism at Harvard have increasingly fueled campus discourse, University President Drew G. Faust will dedicate a memorial to slaves who worked at Harvard in the 18th century.
Faust wrote an op-ed in The Crimson Wednesday announcing that she will undertake several initiatives to unearth and reflect on Harvard’s history of slavery. Next Wednesday, Faust wrote, she will dedicate a plaque on Wadsworth House—a yellow-paneled building on the Yard’s fringe—in honor of four slaves who lived and worked there nearly 300 years ago.
Faust wrote that she has convened a committee of Harvard faculty to propose other similar memorials on campus, and the Radcliffe Institute will host “a major conference on universities and slavery” next spring.
The plaque at Wadsworth will bear the names of Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba, four enslaved people who labored in the house under Harvard’s early presidents. Congressman John R. Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights activist, will join Faust in installing the plaque on April 6.
“Until now, these laborers and their contributions, as well as the broader participation of people of color in early life at Harvard, have been all but invisible,” Faust wrote in her op-ed. “The plaque is the beginning of an effort to remember them and our shared history.”
Faust’s announcement comes as Harvard more broadly reconsiders a number of titles and symbols across the University because of their ties to slavery, drawing national media attention and debate. Harvard Law School will change its seal because of concerns about its associations with a former slaveholding family; the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, approved the change earlier this month. This semester at the College, now-Faculty Deans retired their long-used “House Master” title because of  perceived racial implications of the term “master.”
In her editorial—a rare action for Faust, who last published an op-ed in The Crimson in 2010 based on her Baccalaureate address that May—she ruminated on Harvard’s historical relationship to slavery. Though historians had long ignored the story of slavery in New England, the troubling truth must be understood, she wrote.
“Harvard was directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage from the College’s earliest days in the 17th century until slavery in Massachusetts ended in 1783, and Harvard continued to be indirectly involved through extensive financial and other ties to the slave South up to the time of emancipation,” Faust writes. “This is our history and our legacy, one we must fully acknowledge and understand in order to truly move beyond the painful injustices at its core.”
Faust, a Civil War historian, has previously warned that renaming Harvard’s buildings en masse would amount to an improper negation of history. A number of buildings and streets around campus bear the names of slaveholding former Harvard presidents, including Benjamin Wadsworth, Edward Holyoke, and Increase Mather.
“The past never dies or disappears,” Faust wrote. “It continues to shape us in ways we should not try to erase or ignore.”
Faust’s is not the first effort to study and understand the legacy of slavery on Harvard’s campus. Sven Beckert, a history professor, published a book and website called “Harvard and Slavery” in 2011, the result of several years of research with undergraduate students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2016, at 1:55 p.m.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has issued an April 15 deadline for final clubs to inform administrators whether or not they will go co-ed, according to three club leaders present at a Tuesday meeting with undergraduate leadership of female and male clubs.
The deadline marks the latest in a series of escalating efforts from the College to compel the historically single-sex organizations to open their memberships. The meeting was the first between undergraduate club leadership and the College since the University Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention released a report that sharply condemned the clubs.
The report blasted the clubs with data that showed 47 percent of female College seniors who participated in the groups’ activities had experienced “non consensual contact,” the highest rate among a list of other student organizations in a University-wide sexual climate survey.
The report also criticized the historically all-male final clubs for a culture “often inimical to Harvard’s mission.” A subsidiary subcommittee report even recommended forbidding simultaneous College and single-sex final club membership, a policy that Amherst College adopted in 2014 after releasing a similar report. Khurana’s deadline indicates that the College could still be seriously considering Amherst’s strategy.
An emailed invitation from Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich billed the meeting—held Tuesday in a penthouse conference room in Student Organization Center at Hilles—as an “important opportunity for continued dialogue particularly in light of the recent report of the University Task Force on Sexual Assault.” Before the meeting, Friedrich emailed undergraduate leadership “kindly ask[ing]” them to read two documents: the Task Force’s report and an Inside Higher Ed article headlined  “A Rare Focus on All-Male Groups.”
Over Domino’s pizza and soft drinks, Khurana, joined by Interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña, and Friedrich, fielded numerous questions from undergraduate leaders and wrote on the conference room’s whiteboard for nearly two hours.
After the two-hour meeting with final club leaders from both male and female clubs, Khurana met with undergraduate leaders of  unrecognized fraternities and sororities at Harvard. According to two undergraduates attending that meeting, Khurana did not issue a deadline on a co-ed decision to the Greek life organizations.
After the meetings, administrators expressed optimism. While Friedrich and Khurana declined to go into detail, emphasizing that the meetings were “confidential,” Dingman, attending such meetings for the first time, called them “constructive.” Dela Peña said there were “a lot of questions,” and emphasized “nothing [was] decided.”
However, three undergraduates at the meeting, who were granted anonymity due to the confidential nature of the conversations, said that administrators did announce something: an explicit deadline for clubs to inform the administration whether or not they would shed their single-sex status. College administrators could not be reached for comment late Tuesday night.
Khurana has adopted a sharper tone towards final clubs since beginning his tenure as Dean of the College in July 2014, and last semester, two clubs—the Spee Club and the Fox Club—decided to invite women into their membership. In an October 2015 letter explaining to their graduate board the sudden move to go co-ed, the undergraduate leadership of the Fox referenced a Khurana-imposed November 1 deadline for all clubs to go co-ed, writing that Harvard had “forced [their] hand.” There were no apparent repercussions for the six all-male clubs who did not act on the supposed deadline.
Tuesday night’s meetings were two of many called in an attempt to respond to the sexual assault prevention report. Last Wednesday, graduate members of the eight historically all-male final clubs and five all-female clubs met at the Fly Club for an hours-long meeting. According to two attendees, the meeting did not yield any concrete decisions, with many advocating a wait-and-see approach until Khurana releases his plan to implement task force proposals.
The report has also sounded alarm bells at the College’s burgeoning, though unrecognized, Greek organizations. Representatives from at least three national Greek organizations with unrecognized Harvard chapters—Kappa Kappa Gamma, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and Kappa Alpha Theta—have said they are aware of the report and monitoring the situation.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed that Khurana also met last week with graduate representatives of the A.D. Club, though Khurana declined to comment on the content of the meetings. In the fall, undergraduate members of the A.D. Club wrote that they “strongly” oppose changes in membership policy. At least one A.D. graduate member was also preparing a possible legal defense to a University mandate on final clubs.
University President Drew G. Faust has previously questioned whether final clubs fit into Harvard’s undergraduate social scene. Earlier in March, Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates that the College will develop a specific “implementation plan” about sexual assault prevention by the end of the academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2016, at 1:05 p.m.
Two runs knocked in by the Crimson’s 3-4 combo of Meagan Lantz and Savannah Bradley in the bottom of the third lifted the Harvard softball team past Boston College at Soldiers Field on Tuesday.
Scoring no further runs and registering no more hits over the next three innings, the Crimson (10-11) was forced to rely on its tentative lead the rest of the way. BC (18-13) surged in the sixth inning in an attempt to rally back, but the one-­run lead proved just enough for Harvard to secure a 2-1 win in its home opener.
The one-­run difference was all too familiar to the Crimson, who fell 5­-4 to BC on the Eagles’ home turf in their one meet-up last year.
Harvard maintained the lead for most of that contest before BC came up with three runs, including the go-ahead score, in the bottom of the sixth inning.
The Eagles got going in the sixth yet again on Tuesday, but this time around, only one run was in the cards, ultimately allowing the Crimson to hold on.
The first two innings passed quickly with no hits for both teams. And after freshman infielder Rhianna Rich grounded into a fielder’s choice at second and senior outfielder Zoe Galindo popped out, the bottom half of the third inning seemed destined to end like the scoreless ones before it.
However, a steal of second base by Rich changed the course of the game. After securing her position on second, Rich advanced another scoring position to third on a wild pitch.
Then in her second at bat, Lantz, a freshman third baseman, singled to the right side of the infield, batting in Rich from third for the first run of the game.
Still with two outs, Bradley, a junior infielder, doubled to left field, allowing Lantz to touch home­ plate and increase the lead to two runs.
“The BC pitcher was a very good pitcher with good movement and good pitch placement and command of the zone,” senior catcher Rachel Halperin said. “She was a very effective pitcher, but we were able to string some good hits together against her in the third. Overall I think people had great at bats, but BC is a very respectable opponent.”
Sophomore Allyson Frei went the distance for the Eagles, striking out seven batters in six innings, while allowing no hits outside of the third inning.
Meanwhile, Harvard co-captain Morgan Groom proved vital to the Crimson win as she was able to hold BC to just one hit in five innings. Groom was relieved by junior Taylor Cabe in the top of the sixth.
“Morgan pitched a great game and the ability to string together some hits in the third inning is what got us through against a good pitcher today,” co-captain Zoe Galindo said.
Harvard’s 2-­0 lead was placed in doubt when the Eagles sought to capitalize on the change of pitchers. A Crimson throwing error allowed BC’s Loren DiEmmanuele to reach second and Megan Cooley, whom Groom walked right before being pulled, to advance to third.
A single to right field by senior Jessie Daulton in the following at bat put the Eagles on the board, but right fielder Haley Davis gunned out DiEmmanuele at home, removing a key opportunity for BC to tie the game.
With Daulton moving to second on the throw home, the Eagles still had a chance to close the gap. This gap seemed even smaller when she advanced to third on a passed ball.
But a pop-out in BC’s next at bat effectively decided the game. Cabe gave up just one hit in the top of the seventh to maintain the score as the Crimson held on to its one­-run lead.
“I think the team had fun today,” co-captain Zoe Galindo said. “We were excited to play our first home game with our warm­-up mix there to get us pumped and to defend our home turf. BC is always a talented team on our schedule, and it felt good to get the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a strong indoor season in which she claimed four titles at the track and field Ivy Championships—including individual wins in the 60-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and long jump—freshman Gabby Thomas was faced with high expectations for the outdoor season.
So far, she’s more than lived up to them.
This past weekend at the Raleigh Relays in Raleigh, N.C., Thomas set three new Ivy records, the most notable being a then-NCAA best time of 23.18 seconds in the 200-meter dash—good enough to automatically qualify for the 2016 Olympic Trials.
Thomas will attempt to become Harvard’s first female Olympian in track and field since Dora Gyorffy ’01, who competed in the high jump in the 2000 Sydney Games.
“[Qualifying] was a total surprise,” Thomas said. “I didn’t even know the qualifying time…. After the race, when I went over to my coach and he told me that I made the Olympic Trials, I was like, ‘What did he say?’ I couldn’t believe it.”
Those who have closely followed Thomas’s freshman year, though, could. After all, Thomas had a historically great indoor track and field season, culminating in her dominant performance at the Ivy Championships a month ago.
Indeed, she already owns the Ivy League’s indoor 200-meter dash record—courtesy of a 23.37 she ran back in February—and a plethora of other indoor Ivy records, including in the 60-meter dash.
“As a freshman, at first I didn’t know what I was capable of,” Thomas said. “It’s been a lot of really hard work, and sometimes it’s hard to go to practice every day, but it’s rewarding to know that it’s all paying off.”
And paying off, it is. Thomas’s outdoor season has picked up right where her indoor season left off, exemplified when Thomas ran a 11.39 in the 100-meter during the season’s first meet.
That time was a personal-best and would have been an Ivy record if her run had not been wind-assisted.
Thomas attributes her success this season in part to the leadership of the upperclassmen, including junior Jade Miller and senior Autumne Franklin, who both usually run along with Thomas in the 4x100 and 4x200-meter relays.
“[Jade and Autumne] push us to do better too because they’re so focused and talented,” Thomas said. “We don’t want to let them down when we go out there, since I know they’re putting in their all every time they go out to the track.”
Besides finding inspiration from the upperclassman, Thomas also finds motivation from competition with best friend and fellow freshman sprinter Ngozi Musa—who runs in the same events as Thomas.
“It’s really awesome having an athlete just as strong as I am to compete against in practice,” Thomas said. “At the same time, we’re super supportive of one another, so it’s a good combo…. The competition just drives us to do better individually.”
Musa, besides being a competitor, is also a crucial teammate in the Crimson 4x100 and 4x200-meter relay squads, composed of Thomas, Musa, Miller, and Franklin. This past weekend, the four-girl squad broke program and Ivy records in both of these races. The 4x200 Ancient Eight record even fell by more than a second.
“As one of our two captains, I’m thrilled to see such strong performances coming from our girls,” co-captain Paige Kouba said.
“Coach [Jason Saretsky] knew [Gabby] was good in high school, but she hadn’t yet shown the world what she could do yet,” she added.
And what better platform to show the world than the qualifying trials for the world’s biggest sporting event?
“At the Trials, I’m just going to do my best and trust in my coach,” Thomas said. “I’m excited to learn a lot about the people around me… so it’s a really good chance for me to focus on my own race and get better using the competition there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After their client, Jimmy Vesey, elected to test August's NHL free agency period rather than sign immediately with the Nashville Predators, Peter Fish and Peter Donatelli of Global Hockey Consultants, Vesey’s agency, issued this statement Wednesday afternoon:
After being fully advised of his options and upon the recommendation of his advisors and counselors, Jimmy Vesey shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent on August 15, 2016. The Nashville Predators were informed of this decision. Nashville now claims and it has been widely reported that they were without knowledge of this possibility and that this lack of knowledge precluded the hockey club from acquiring a player at the Trade Deadline. This contention is not accurate. The Nashville Predators were informed prior to the Trade Deadline that they should conduct their business as they saw fit and that the potential of signing or not signing Jimmy Vesey should not be a factor in their decision.
The club has further claimed that the decision to elect Unrestricted Free Agency is bizarre and does not make sense financially. If this election was based solely in regard to money Jimmy would have signed after his third college season, burned a year off of his Entry Level Contract, and been eligible for both signing bonus and salary compensation. A full analysis of his options was conducted. Whether Jimmy will lose any money is speculative at best. However, it is believed such a loss, if any, can be more than made up as a result of on ice and off ice opportunities in the City and Organization of his close. Without question there will be excellent opportunities presented to Jimmy and his success, including financial success on and off the ice, will be determined by hard work, ability, and the opportunity to choose the City and Organization that best suits his skill set.
The decision to become an Unrestricted free Agent was ultimately determined by what was best for Jimmy Vesey’s hockey career. This election, although unrelated to the determining hockey factors, will also allow Jimmy to graduate from Harvard University this spring. Jimmy and his family are very proud and pleased that this will indeed happen. The Harvard community and alumni have rallied around him. Jimmy is very appreciative of this support and the fact that he will now be able to graduate.
