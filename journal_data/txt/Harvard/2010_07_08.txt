After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents Donald H. Heathfield and Tracey L. A. Foley are being held in New York, along with the other eight defendants, to await their arraignment later this afternoon.
During a surprise hearing in court yesterday morning, Heathfield and Foley waived their right to fight a transfer to New York for further legal proceedings.
"My client would like to go to New York to face the charges which are pending against them there. He’d like to do that as fast as he can," said Peter Krupp, Heathfield’s lawyer, to Marianne B. Bowler, the magistrate judge who presided over the hearing at the U.S. District Court in Boston.
The two defendants, who will be prosecuted in a federal court in Manhattan, are not contesting their purported identities as spies, nor are they admitting to the allegations, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney John T. McNeil.
Heathfield, a master's in public administration alumnus from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2000, and his wife were arrested at their Trowbridge Street home in Cambridge last Sunday. The duo was charged with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Heathfield allegedly met with a U.S. government official involved with nuclear weapons research and was tasked with assembling data on U.S. foreign policy.
The decision to waive rights to fight the transfer comes amidst news of possible negotiations of a spy swap between the United States and Russia. The Russian spy suspects in the U.S. that were arrested last week could be traded for a group of foreigners being held in Russia.
According to The New York Times, the federal government is also in talks with the lawyers of the 10 defendants to develop a resolution that would allow the defendants quick guilty pleas with potentially fewer charges or lesser penalties.
The resolution would save the United States from entering protracted trials during which intelligence information could be exposed, the Times reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Police are on the lookout for the perpetrators of three separate  assaults against women—two of whom were minors—in public spaces  throughout Cambridge earlier this week.
The Cambridge Police Department has increased patrols following the  recent string of assaults—which police believe to be unrelated,  according to spokesman Daniel M. Riviello—and relased two citizen  alerts, warning readers against wearing headphones and advising women to  avoid walking ouside alone.
The most recent of the assaults took place at around 9:50 a.m. yesterday, when a 15-year-old girl was accosted by a man on Fulkerson Street, less than two miles east of Harvard Square. After trying to lure the victim with candy, the suspect grabbed her hand. When she attempted to move away from him, he jogged toward her and grabbed her hand again.
The victim described the suspect as a 45-year-old white man between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-7, who possessed a cane and had blond hair with a bald patch near the front of his head.
Earlier that morning, a 16-year-old girl was assaulted on a Red Line train at the Kendall T station. At about 12:25 a.m., a man reached for the front of her shirt, pulled it down, and grabbed her right breast, according to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police.
Security cameras captured an image of the suspect—who was described by the victim as a 6-foot-tall white man between 23 and 27 years of age with short blond hair, blue eyes, and no facial hair—and the MBTA Transit Police posted the picture on its website and on "Wanted" posters.
Both of these assaults came a day after a woman was attacked while jogging near Kinglsey Park, about a mile away from the Quad. Upon seeing the jogger pass him, the assailant followed her and threw her down to the ground, according to the CPD alert. The victim, who did not sustain any injuries, described the assailant as a 5-foot-9 white man with a dark buzz cut.
Following the Kinglsey Park incident, the Cambridge police released a set of guidelines for those who walk and jog outdoors, such as varying one’s route, exercising with a friend in a known area, wearing bright clothing, and carrying pepper spray or a personal safety alarm.

Ten individuals suspected of serving as unregistered agents for the Russian government pled guilty during their arraignment Thursday afternoon in New York City.
The defendants included Cambridge residents Donald H. Heathfield—an alumnus of the Kennedy School of Government—and his wife Tracey L. A. Foley, who were arrested last week at their home on Trowbridge Street. Their real names, they revealed at today’s hearing, are Andrey Bezrukov and Elena Vavilova.
The couple was transferred from Boston earlier this week to join the eight other defendants arrested in the United States. Their arraignment comes after a multi-year investigation by the FBI and other federal agencies into a program that officials believe was sanctioned by the Russian foreign intelligence service.
The defendants, who could face up to five years in prison, lived in the United States under false identities and were charged with infiltrating U.S. policymaking circles.
Heathfield and Foley were charged with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to their lawyer, the couple wanted a quick resolution to the prosecution if that would best help their two sons, Timothy and Alexander Foley.
Heathfield, who graduated from the Master’s in Public Administration program at the Kennedy School in 2000, allegedly met with a U.S. government official involved with nuclear weapons research and was tasked with assembling data on U.S. foreign policy.
The outcome of Thursday’s arraignment serves as a crucial step in a spy swap negotiation between the United States and Russia. Judge Kimba M. Wood of United States District Court described a separate agreement in which the Russian government would release four individuals who are incarcerated in Russia for “alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies.”
Eight of the 10 suspects had been under surveillance for at least four years, and only one of the defendants is a naturalized American citizen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After thousands of hours of weight lifting, conditioning, and shooting drills over the course of his basketball career, Jeremy Lin’s dream of playing in the NBA could come down to just the next 240 minutes of basketball he plays.
Tomorrow afternoon, Lin makes his NBA Summer League debut for the Dallas Mavericks.
Like many NBA hopefuls who were not selected on the June 24 draft, Lin was invited by the Mavericks immediately following the draft to compete on the squad’s summer league roster, which will participate in a series of five games in Las Vegas from July 9 to 18.
While the odds are stacked against undrafted players getting signed to an NBA contract, a strong performance could land the point guard an invitation to the Mavericks mini-camp and potentially a spot on the team’s roster.
So far, Lin has gotten off on the right foot, impressing members of the Maverick’s organization.
“[Lin’s] opened my eyes,” said Monte Mathis, coach of the Mavericks summer league squad, to the Dallas Morning News. “He’s deceptively athletic and knows how to play. He’s just got to get the shot together a little. But he guards and stays in front of people. He’s a dark horse in my eyes right now.”
But if Lin hopes to keep his NBA dream alive, his first step will be a strong performance tomorrow afternoon.
The Mavericks are set to tip-off against the Denver Nuggets at 1 p.m. The game will air on NBA TV or can be seen online by purchasing Summer League Broadband through NBA.com for $14.95.
