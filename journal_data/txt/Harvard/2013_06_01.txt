After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2012-2013 Harvard men’s basketball season began in the shadow of the Gov 1310: “Introduction to Congress” cheating scandal, which led to the withdrawal of the team’s co-captains, Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13. From the start, the defending Ivy League champions were no longer favored to repeat. The year started with a blasé fan base and a turbid forecast, with the springtime frenzy of last season’s run long dissipated. But it ended with a bang, not a whimper.
Harvard’s season opened without its captains, and its record started out at a mediocre 2-3. Slowly, though, things changed. A freshman point guard, Siyani Chambers ’16, thrust into a starting role, emerged as Ivy League Rookie of the Year. A veteran, Christian Webster ’13, once relegated to a bench role, came alive as a leader. A team coalesced under its coach and played as a well-knit unit. And Laurent Rivard ’14 hit a lot of three pointers.
That last item might not count as a change (although it did reach a program record). But suffice it to say that Harvard’s against-the-odds push to the postseason, coupled with an earth- and bracket-shattering win over third-seeded New Mexico, took the school and the NCAA by surprise. Of course, for most of the world, Harvard’s basketball run was just that: a basketball run. An ESPN image reading “Harvard Just Busted My Bracket” (and featuring a paper bracket two-thirds through a shredder) surely summed up the impact on the majority of Americans—a few dollars lost in the office pool or a few days of gloating over a bit of clairvoyance. But to Harvard, the basketball performance meant more than the 68-62 final score against New Mexico. It meant more both as a direct cause and as a sign of something bigger.
As for the causal side, Harvard’s basketball run caused what March basketball success causes at most colleges fortunate enough to obtain it. It caused giddiness, camaraderie, and pride in the school. The basketball team’s run ignited the student body in Cambridge and Harvard alumni around the globe. Some fans helped give the seats in Salt Lake City’s EnergySolutions Arena a redoubtable Harvard presence. Others partook in on-campus viewing parties, and alums filled bars to watch the team together. Although scattered during spring break, students turned to social media to connect, to gnaw their collective nails, and then to celebrate. Even the Crimson’s loss two days later to the Arizona Wildcats did little to dampen the communal spirit.
But Harvard’s men’s basketball ascendancy, from 66 straight years without NCAA appearances to a ranked, national competitor and producer of NBA talent, is also proof of athletics’ potential on an unlikely campus. This campus qualifies as “unlikely” in part because the Ivy League owes its renown to research and academics, not to basketball. But a concerted administration and alumni push garnered a top-class coach and built a winning team in Cambridge. Similarly, a fusion of coaching and talent (and this year, an NFL draft pick) helped the Crimson football team earn wins in eleven of the past twelve Harvard-Yale games.
“Unlikely” also fits because athletics do not carry a clear, tangible advantage for Harvard. The school is hardly wanting for applicants, a common justification at many colleges. As for money, the Harvard basketball team earned $1,225,999 million in 2011-2012. It also spent $1,225,999. But a prime if less calculable result of Harvard’s athletics success comes in the community it engenders—or perhaps reveals. That community spans generations: A seamless line of succession links the student sections at Harvard Stadium, or Lavietes Pavilion, or the Bright Hockey Center with alumni and their televisions across the country and the globe.
At times, the phrase “Harvard community,” a claim of unity and identity, seems more the stuff of Admissions Office agitprop than a student reality. Harvard is a kaleidoscope of clubs, organizations, teams, concentrations, origins, and more. But the example of Harvard’s basketball run shows that room remains for the school to unite. Fandom is a great leveler. It orients a group toward one common goal and one common set of emotions, a brief but salubrious respite from the more personalized rigors of academic and extracurricular life. Just as both individual diversity and social cohesion boost corporate productivity, a cohesive Harvard is worth having too.
Of course, while Harvard’s athletic successes, especially in basketball, evince the real presence of a community, they do not circumscribe it. Basketball is not religion at Harvard. Tommy Amaker is not a god—although more Crimson success might make us revisit that. The Harvard-Yale football game’s allure, for instance, derives in part from the sporting event, but very significantly from students’ events and experiences surrounding it.
In a non-athletic example, Housing Day channels school pride through the spirit its Houses stir up. And on a different note, even the Marathon bombings and ensuing manhunt, a time of tragedy and threat, revealed a communal character: Students and administrators reached out to friends and family who had run or watched the race, then huddled around police scanners or took to the open air of Harvard Yard in a move of confidence and resolve. Sometimes, the Harvard community truly shows itself—maybe when a new class learns its House for the next three years, maybe when tragedy strikes, and maybe when five young men step onto a wooden court and produce something special.
Looking ahead, the apparent future for the Crimson on the court has us excited. Erstwhile captains Casey and Curry will return for a final year. Zena Edosoman ’17, the first Scout.com Top 100 prospect to grace the Ivy League, will join the team this fall. Wesley Saunders ’15 and Siyani Chambers ’16 will both be a year older. Laurent Rivard will keep shooting. Meanwhile, Class of 2015 players like Steve Moundou-Missi and Kenyatta Smith will enter the season with experience after bolstering a depleted roster. And of course, Tommy Amaker will be the coach.
Still, as last season demonstrated, predicted success is not assured success, but nor is a single tournament win what this is all about. The essence lies in a Harvard basketball team and a broader athletic program with relevance and excitement to draw in students, to bring them together. Then again, when March 2014 arrives, a win or two would be nice as well. Harvard basketball has us dreaming. Better yet, it has the Harvard community dreaming, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little over a year ago, Harvard University made an unprecedented announcement that presented a stark challenge to those who would color it as a bastion of exclusivity and elitism. The announcement was of the creation of edX, a series of massive open online courses—commonly called MOOCs—offered in conjunction with Harvard’s Kendall Square neighbor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. EdX seeks to use open source software to provide online education to thousands of students across the world, free of charge. We have been highly supportive of this ambitious proposal from the start, and the program’s inaugural year has only made us more optimistic about the role Harvard will play in the future of accessible higher education. Last semester, edX expanded to partner with local community colleges in an effort to broaden its reach. This past week, edX added 15 course-offering schools across the globe, including six in Asia, three in Europe, and one in Australia.
This recent development has brought the program’s member count to 27, a number that seems to be in the process of perpetual growth. We are heartened by the efforts Harvard has taken to be at the vanguard of groundbreaking online pedagogy and are excited at the next steps in innovation undoubtedly still to come. Occasional news of faculty opposition to the program—at Harvard as well as Amherst College and San Jose State—while perhaps understandable, is ultimately unfortunate and has the potential to contravene must-needed ingenuity in the field of higher education.
The scale of edX as an institutional commitment can hardly be overstated. Harvard and MIT each invested $30 million into the program, a necessary sum to provide free coursework to students across the world. It is no great secret that higher education is increasingly becoming prohibitively expensive, a disastrous trend considering the amount of employers that now require college degrees. As a result, young adults are entering the workforce up to their knees in student loans to be repaid, with young adults reporting a median debt of an eye-popping $38,100.  That edX offers students the option of obtaining a certificate of mastery upon course completion could be a game changer, opening up job opportunities to the underserved individuals that had been previously unable to attain a college-level education.
Harvard and MIT proved their commitment to this end by welcoming two local community colleges to the program. This culture of inclusivity not only serves to enlarge the number of students with access to higher learning, but it also leads to the enrichment of didacticism as an art form and as a product in constant development. For example, the addition of Bunker Hill Community College and MassBay Community College was concomitant with the combination of virtual and in-person learning as an element in the program. Furthermore, a recent New Yorker profile of edX discusses the necessary modifications that come with transferring traditional lecture hall coursework and subsequent evaluation to an online medium, which include discussion forums, Google Doc-like paper annotation, and multiple-choice quizzes. The future of higher education is still up in the air, and we appreciate any and all experimental efforts to come up with the best possible regiment for the next generations of students.
It is clear that higher education is at a turning point and that the present model, which prices a large chunk of the populace out of a traditional campus education, is unsustainable in the long run. So far the market solution to the problem of high costs and limited enrollment has been for-profit universities, largely predatory institutions that capitalize off federal loan programs and feel little remorse when their usually low-income students default on those massive loans. Thus, the addition of widely available low-cost education should be a welcome antidote to this toxic nostrum.
While edX and the other MOOC offerings in the nation are certainly not in their final or perfect forms, their desire to experiment with providing universal access to scholarship is one that must be commended. Thus, letters like the one just signed by 58 Faculty of Arts & Sciences professors are worrisome. While we sympathize with the signatories’ desire to clarify “ethical and educational principles” as they pertain to edX, we should resist any move toward faculty oversight of the edX program, which would only serve to add more hierarchical bureaucracy to what, in its ideal form, should be egalitarian and democratic. It is not difficult to surmise the fears of these professors, who likely worry that the quality of higher education will be significantly debased by presenting it in a format amenable to mass-consumption. Others, such as the critics at Amherst fear that the program militates against the very goals of a “a purposefully small residential community.” Criticism that online-only education diminishes a crucial in-person aspect to tutelage is neither new nor unwarranted. However, the establishment of faculty oversight is not the solution. Such a move could put needless bureaucratic strictures on a program that needs to be nimble and adaptable.
Unsurprisingly, professors at many institutions outside of the edX consortium have expressed fears that MOOCs will replace in-person instruction almost entirely.  In an open letter to Harvard professor Michael Sandel, the Philosophy Department of San Jose State University wrote that MOOCs might eventually reduce professors to mere “glorified teaching assistant[s].” Yet these fears are overblown. Scholars who create new, valuable knowledge will always have a place in academia. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine that society will be, on the whole, worse off by increasing access to top-notch educational resources. When one weighs the concerns of the San Jose State faculty against the numerous benefits that edX provides—largely to underprivileged students—it is clear that the program presents a net gain.
It is altogether possible, and certainly desirable that, further down the road, the online platform may benefit from the input and insight of the FAS and other faculty organizations. But in the short run, it would be unwise to place edX under a governing body that has an interest in restraining the growth of MOOCs.  The potential for online education remains relatively unexplored, so platforms like edX require, at minimum, an incubator period in which to expand, change, make progress, and make mistakes that eventually lead to advancement and refinement.  Reacting too quickly to faculty concerns about edX while it is still in its infancy may cut this period of maturation short, limiting its potential growth and impact.  We hope that Harvard will continue to nurture the process of innovation in the promising field of online education.
