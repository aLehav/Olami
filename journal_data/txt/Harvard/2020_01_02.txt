After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past 127 years, Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker” has come to dominate the ballet world. Year after year, kids charm their grandparents in giant gingerbread costumes, budding ballerinas compete for the coveted role of the Snow Queen, and dancers of all ages are awed by the superhuman Sugar Plum Fairy. What explains the “The Nutcracker”’s enduring charm, and can it still thrill modern audiences? While other ballet companies are shying away from the Christmas classic, the Boston Ballet’s 2019 production, which ran Nov. 29 - Dec. 29 at the Citizens Bank Opera House, sought to answer these questions. With everything from giant, sparkling set pieces in full Christmas glory to charismatic cast members that infused familiar choreography with energy and humor, the Boston Ballet’s production proved “The Nutcracker” is truly built to last.
Starting off, the show’s production design felt both fresh and nostalgic. Set and costume designer Robert Perdziola opted for giant, glittering murals over typical three dimensional trees or clouds. The incredible detailing — hundreds of tiny cherubs in The Land of Sweets, tiny painted ornaments on the famous giant Christmas tree — added fun and character to the classic settings. The costumes, likewise, were delightful down to the little details, such as tiny sequined snowflakes on layers of rich tulle or subtle petaled ruffles for the Waltz of the Flowers.
The vibrancy of the performance came not just from gorgeous sets and costumes, but also from key dancers’ truly top-notch performances. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping of these was 12-year-old New Jersey native Emma Blake’s performance as the beloved Clara. Blake was completely self-assured, imbuing even the space between each movement with utter energy and excitement. With the charisma of a born principal, she stole the spotlight even from mature dancers like the experienced Drosselmeier (Paulo Arrais). Blake did not waste a single famous step, her flawless articulation and radiant joy lending her Clara with both the maturity of an older dancer and the excitement of someone dancing the steps for the first time.
In contrast to Blake’s youthful exuberance, Chisako Oga’s Sugar Plum Fairy had a coy, graceful restraint that made the ballet as a whole all the richer. In a show that gave a lot of stage time to very young dancers from the Boston Ballet School, Oga's restrained grandeur lent her iconic character all the mystery and maturity of the original.
Another standout was Chrystyn Fentroy, whose sultry adaptation of the famous Arabian variation showcased the powerful, alluring fluidity of its more contemporary choreography. Moving through superhuman lifts and mind-boggling extensions with subtle, sensual ease, Fentroy and her partner Paul Craig were possibly the night’s most unforgettable performers. In contrast to the very classic choreography around them, their movement was all the more explosive and awe-inspiring. In a short routine, they reminded the audience of all the possibility of ballet at its most boundary-breaking, taking each reach, each arch, and each intimate contour of expression one step farther than seemed possible.
While showcasing carefully fine-tuned technique, the Boston Ballet’s production also embraced the childlike humor of the show and never took itself too seriously. In fact, the show’s particularly comedic moments were also some of its highlights. From the adorable black sheep’s intentional missteps, to the mouse King’s minions posing as vogue models and yoga students, to their signature confusingly large and athletic Nutcracker Bear, the performance was marked by its whole-hearted embrace of ballet as not just serious, but fun.
From its adorable groups of young dancers to its mesmerizing principals, the Boston Ballet’s “The Nutcracker” has something for everyone: not just serious, but fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1868, “Little Women” was a radical book. Spotlighting the independent, subversive imagination of ordinary teenage girls, it challenged both the absence of women’s voices in literature and what literature itself could look like.
More than 150 years later, Lousia May Alcott’s classic novel is no longer alone in a tiny canon of serious books about women. Has the book, then, become just a reminder of outdated forms of oppression, a nostalgic memory of scarlet fever, and sexist marriage laws? Or is it something more timeless, something beyond its giant dresses and mind-boggling labor laws — a book that can still speak to the challenges of womanhood today? In her glossy and ambitious 2019 update, Greta Gerwig seems determined to prove the latter. But while visually ravishing and brimming with standout performances, Gerwig fatally misses the revolutionary core of the story. A mix of preachy tirades against marriage and cheesy rom-com happy endings, the film trades Alcott’s original radicalism for an Austenian marriage-drama without any of the subtlety or cynicism.
To start off, you cannot understand the disappointment of “Little Women” without understanding its many strengths. From a visual standpoint, the film is a masterpiece. Gerwig spares no expense in bringing each setting — from the March family’s cozy, perfectly decorated home to the worn lace drapes in Aunt March’s empty mansion — to lavish life. Its rosy, afternoon-glow lighting draws viewers into the life of the March family as though they are an intimate part of it. And for a story that’s been adapted into 12 different TV series, Gerwig’s ability to fit the highlights into a satisfying, if rushed, 2 hours and 15 minutes is impressive.
Under Gerwig’s deft hand, many of Alcott’s rich, fascinating characters are brought to life like never before. As Meg March, the oldest of the four titular sisters, Emma Watson appears fully at home in a role in a way she has in few previous performances. Perhaps this is because Watson’s previous roles have been held back by a kind of perfectionism, a heroism and flawlessness that can make her noble Disney princess or Biblical hero feel a little flat. Watson’s understandable tendency to turn the women she plays into faultless role models is finally tempered here — Meg simply cannot satisfy everyone no matter how hard she tries. Watching Watson’s Meg grapple with impossible personal and financial choices not only puts Watson at her best, but allows her to embody and satirize the straightjacket of her own public persona. Herself a victim of a culture that demanded perfect boyfriends and perfect feminism in equal turn, Watson makes the prim and proper Meg more sympathetic and relatable than ever before.
Like Watson, fellow social media darling Timothée Chalamet both fills out and contemporizes a character that can easily be read as one-dimensional. As the March sisters’ brooding, rich neighbor Laurie, Chalamet’s utter physical creativity delights and surprises at every turn. Whether drunk and twirling at a party or serious and bored in Latin class, he manages to be comic and heartbroken, stupid and serious all at the same time. As he grows up and out of conventional masculinity, Chalamet’s Laurie develops a vulnerability and maturity throughout the movie from the women around him that is more rich and thoughtful than any previous incarnation of the character. He doesn’t just model a humbler, more sensitive version of masculinity — he markets the hell out of it.
Unfortunately, Saiorse Ronan, the movie’s third millennial celebrity, leaves far more to be desired. As unbridled, hot-headed Jo, Ronan constantly feels like she’s half-heartedly dressing up as an unconvincing caricature of a tomboy. While Jo’s words in the book on her “disappointment at being a girl” and how she “loves her liberty” come out of Ronan’s mouth, her acting and mannerisms not only fail to embody those words but undermine them. It seems as though the sheer number of times the script finds it necessary to call Ronan’s Jo an “unladylike girl” is compensation for the fact that Ronan barely stands out from her sisters.
The dissonance between Ronan’s performative so-called radicalism and generally unimpressive performance is not the only problem with her Jo, however. Beyond this dichotomy in personality, Ronan constantly tells the audience how much she hates marriage and romance without ever showing it. On the one hand, Gerwig scatters the film — which ricochets between childhood and adulthood in rushed, arbitrary fashion — with scenes that attempt to paint Jo as Alcott’s mirror image. Not only does Gerwig add scenes to the story where Jo writes her own “Little Women” about herself and her sisters, but the struggles Jo faces in negotiating its publication are clearly based off of Alcott’s biography. These original additions skew her character toward Alcott’s likeness, who was famously “committed to never marrying.” She ultimately married her beloved Jo off “out of perversity” — not because she (or Jo, for that matter) really wanted to get married, but because her publisher forced her to do so.
But Jo, in Gerwig’s adaptation, is far from anti-marriage. Gerwig subverts this aversion to marriage by altering the story’s most infamous, radical moment: when Jo rejects Laurie. To many, Jo’s decision is the revolutionary core of “Little Women” — an earth-shattering, genre-defying declaration that a girl could want something more than to marry her rich best friend. But Gerwig’s adaptation utterly dilutes the radicalism of that moment. It flounders, first, in the childish, giggly and flirtatious relationship she has with Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel), whom Gerwig changes to a less mean, less ugly “heartthrob” and Jo’s fairytale happy-ending.
But the adaptation’s hypocrisy is not just that Jo marrying the 30-year-old hot teacher version of Timothée Chalamet is pawned off as independent and radical. Rather, the biggest hypocrisy is that Ronan’s Jo doesn’t even really reject Laurie in the first place. No longer does she boldly declare she “did not love her boy, and never could.” Rather, she offers Laurie a list of worries that ultimately melt when she changes her mind and sends him a letter begging for another chance. Perhaps, the idea of softening its unbreakable heroine in an ostensible moment of weakness could be viewed as making Jo more relatable or more emblematic of a version of feminism that is not “anti-men.” But this interpretation misses the motivations of Jo’s character in the first place. Jo’s decision was never about being anti-men, but about subverting the male-dependent nature of the entire genre of inevitably romantic stories about women. By finding her fulfillment not in the perfect relationship, but in her writing and her career, Jo as a character championed a new vision of happiness that was just as fulfilling as Austen’s or Brontë’s.
This is not to say that wanting to get married — as Meg’s character has always so beautifully dramatized — is unfeminist. The problem is that marriage in their world was nonnegotiable. A woman could marry happily or unhappily, in life and in literature, but she could not be happy alone. Jo’s entire character arc poses the question: What if a woman who needed the money met a nice, wealthy boy she got along with, but only loved him “like a brother?”
It’s difficult to watch Ronan’s heartsick pining over romantic montages of Laurie in the final scenes of the movie and believe this is the same Jo who told Laurie she was “happy as I am, and love my liberty too well” to marry him. Rather, Gerwig’s Jo feels like a contradiction, a woman who rather than celebrating her fiery independence, ends up ultimately regretting it.
Without question, Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women” is gorgeous and impressive in many ways. But with Ronan’s meandering, unsatisfying Jo at the helm, this beautiful, saccharine update’s wavering heart holds it back from its real potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s Office of Career Services urged its students to apply for clerkships with Trump-appointed judges last month after they failed to utilize the office's internal network to work with the jurists, drawing criticism from some students and scholars.
In a series of messages to students and alumni, the Office of Career Services and alumni said that the lack of applications on file seemed like “wasted opportunities,” according to Bloomberg Law.
On Dec. 17, the school sent a message encouraging students to apply to work with newly confirmed Ninth Circuit judge Lawrence VanDyke in Nevada.
“Lawrence VanDyke (HLS ’06) was confirmed last week to become a new judge on the Ninth Circuit based in Reno (‘next to Lake Tahoe and great skiing!’),” the message read.
VanDyke was confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 11. In October, the American Bar Association found him to be “Not Qualified” to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In a letter to United States Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ABA cited interviews in which VanDyke was characterized as “lacking in knowledge” and “arrogant,” and raised concerns about his judgment towards LGBTQ individuals.
The Ninth Circuit did not respond to a request for comment.
Based in California, the Ninth Circuit, which reviews cases for several western states, is one of the most desirable clerkships, according to Bloomberg Law.
In a follow-up message on Dec. 19, the Law School referenced other 2020 clerkships that received zero applications from Harvard, including the Los Angeles chambers of California appellate court judge John Wiley and a recently confirmed Ninth Circuit judge, Patrick Bumatay.
“If you could be available for a 2020 clerkship, now is a time you can stand out with just the Harvard brand name, not to mention your other qualifications, as the applicant pool nationwide shrinks,” the message read.
That same day, the People’s Parity Project — a Law School student group that has pushed law firms to dispose of controversial arbitration policies — tweeted criticizing the school’s messages.
“Harvard thinks we have ‘wasted opportunities’ by not applying to these judges,” the group wrote.
A screenshot posted on the organization’s Twitter shows listings for clerkships for VanDyke, Southern District of Ohio Judge Douglas Cole, Eastern District of Missouri Judge Sarah Pitlyk, Ninth Circuit Judge Patrick Bumatay, and California Court of Appeals Judge John Wiley in Los Angeles.
Both Pitlyk and VanDyke have received “Not Qualified” ratings by the American Bar Association.
Law School Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark Weber wrote in an emailed statement that his office works to share available clerkship opportunities for students.
“We work to share available clerkship opportunities with our students, confident they will apply for the ones that best suit their interests and needs,” he wrote. “We understand that different judges appeal to different applicants for different reasons.”
University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman — who previously taught at the Law School — also sharply criticized Harvard’s message on Twitter. Litman previously clerked for the Sixth Circuit and for now-retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
“It’s not responsible to tell students that they should apply to any/every judge, or to say that *anyone* with whom the students might disagree is a judge they should be willing to clerk for,” she wrote on Dec. 20. “It is also a good reminder to our profession that we should be thinking (and rethinking) the kinds of positions/jobs/work experiences we reward."
In a blog post, Litman added that Harvard students are in a "fortunate position," as they come from a “top law school.”
“HLS students are in an extremely fortunate position – because they’re at a top law school, they have more choices among clerkships than students who might be applying for clerkships from a lower ranked school,” she wrote. “If some students are exercising that privilege to stand up for themselves or others, they should be applauded, not chastised.”
The Law School’s Office of Career Services wrote in a post that it will continue to promote more clerkship opportunities in the future.
“We will continue to post separately about any new opportunities that come to our attention for before Fall 2020,” the school wrote. “There will be more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal judge charged a Harvard Medical School-affiliated researcher Monday with attempting to smuggle research from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at the behest of the Chinese government.
Zaosong Zheng, who is from China, received a Harvard-sponsored visa to study in the United States last year. In a Monday hearing, U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge David H. Hennessy said evidence suggested Zheng tried to smuggle vials of specimens out of the country in a sock packed in his suitcase, according to the Boston Globe.
Zheng — who was arrested Dec. 10 — allegedly stole the materials from a lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he worked.
Zheng’s arrest comes shortly after the National Institutes of Health and the FBI have begun launching investigations into Chinese scientists and researchers who have purportedly stolen research from the United States for the Chinese government.
At Harvard, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs announced at a November faculty meeting that the school had formed two new oversight committees in response to NIH inquiries into potential “academic espionage” by faculty members at American universities. One of the Harvard committees is tasked with reviewing sensitive research projects; the other is examining Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies to ensure the school complies with guidelines set forth by federal funding agencies.
During Monday’s hearing, Hennessy said Zheng was a flight risk, noting that his connections to the Chinese government, which gave him a scholarship, would facilitate his travel. The judge also granted federal prosecutors’ requests to detain Zheng until his Dec. 30 trial, according to the Globe.
In an affidavit, Kara D. Spice, an FBI agent, wrote that there was probable cause to believe Zheng made a series of “false, fictitious, and fraudulent” statements to Customs and Border Protection.
After CBP agents assigned to Boston Logan International Airport identified Zheng as a “high risk for possibly exporting undeclared biological material,” officers went to the bag room of Hainan Airlines, where they located two checked bags in his name.
“The checked bags were physically examined,” Spice wrote in the affidavit. “The examination resulted in the discovery of twenty one (21) vials wrapped in a plastic bag and concealed in a sock. The vials were visually inspected and appeared to contain a brown liquid with both typed and handwritten descriptions and notes.”
Spice wrote that, based on her experience, the vials “contained what appeared to be biological materials that were not properly declared or packaged.”
Zheng repeatedly denied carrying biological materials, according to the affidavit. Asked why he did not declare the vials, he initially told CBP officers that “they were not important and had nothing to do with his research.” As the interview continued, he said a friend gave him the vials.
Zheng eventually confessed to stealing eight vials from his former research lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
Though Zheng stated that no one else was aware of the incident, he told authorities that he replicated 11 vials based on Zhang Tao’s research at Beth Israel over a period of two to three months, per the affidavit. Eventually, he told officers he planned to take the vials to his lab at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital and publish a paper in his name if the research was in any way successful, according to Spice.
The precise contents of the vials that CBP found in Zheng’s bag remain unknown, Spice wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email to The Crimson that Zheng’s visa sponsorship began Sept. 4, 2018, but that the University offers visa sponsorship to faculty and researchers in the Harvard-affiliated hospitals who hold joint academic appointments with Harvard Medical School. Beth Israel, which is a Harvard teaching hospital, fired Zheng after his arrest at Boston Logan International Airport on a charge of making false statements.
Beth Israel spokesperson Jennifer Kritz wrote in an email that she is “deeply proud” of the hospital’s research programs.
“Any efforts to compromise research undermine the hard work of our faculty and staff to advance patient care,” Kritz wrote. “We are grateful for the diligence and professionalism of federal law enforcement in this case and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation of this matter.”
The U.S. District Attorney's Office in Boston declined to comment on the case, citing their ongoing investigation into the matter. Brendan O. Kelley, who is serving as Zheng’s public defender, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Correction: Jan. 2, 2020
A previous version of this article stated that Zaosong Zheng was a Harvard Medical School student. In fact, he was a researcher at a Harvard-affiliated hospital.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to the ice just days before the new year, the No. 17 Harvard men’s hockey team jetted to Southern California for a double-header against No. 16/14 Arizona State. The Crimson had had a three-week winter break to put its four-game losing skid behind it; for their part, the Sun Devils were looking to steady an up-and-down year before the second half of the hockey season began in full swing.
The contest, played at the training facility of the NHL’s Anaheim Ducks, marks the first time since the 1999 Frozen Four that a college hockey game has been played in the Golden State.
“Playing here is really special,” said Anaheim Ducks prospect and rookie defenseman Henry Thrun. “Coming back here for the first time since the summer has been a lot of fun. And seeing a lot of fans here, that was pretty cool.”
Harvard (7-4-1, 6-2 ECAC) put on its usual show of offensive talent and goaltending prowess to take the first game by a score of 4-1, but Arizona State (10-7-3) came back for a closely-fought overtime contest that ended a 4-4 tie. While college hockey officially counts this a draw, the teams played an NHL-style extra frame of 3-on-3 overtime, in which Crimson sophomore forward Casey Dornbach punched home the winner.
“I thought it was an exciting game,” said head coach Ted Donato of the overtime contest. “Coaches don’t always appreciate that... I think our team took a step forward, from where we were before the break. That’s a good sign.”
In what has become a normal disruption for Harvard this time of year, the team was missing one player to Team USA at World Juniors — in this case, sophomore forward Jack Drury. In his absence, freshman forward John Farinacci was called upon to center the Crimson’s productive top line, alongside Dornbach and fellow rookie Nick Abruzzese.
But the squad also had a happier lineup change, as first-year forward Austin Wong was finally able to make his debut after weeks of injury recovery. Wong slotted in at right wing, playing alongside sophomore Baker Shore and senior Colton Kerfoot.
“I thought he was excellent,” coach Donato said of Wong. “His compete level was great; it was nice to see him light up after he scored [on Saturday]. Our whole bench was really excited for him.”
HARVARD 4, ARIZONA STATE 4 (OT)
At the start of the second period in Sunday’s game, it seemed as though the Crimson would be taking home two wins. The squad held the lead after two first-period goals. Starting off the scoring, freshman defenseman Ryan Siedem stuffed in a rebound off a shot from senior forward Frédéric Grégoire, beating Sun Devils rookie net-minder Max Prawdzik. Soon after, Abruzzese’s pass from behind the goal line found Dornbach in the slot, and the sophomore shot the puck past Prawdzik’s blocker.
“I thought that whole [first] line looked like they were creating chances and creating opportunities,” coach Donato said. “[The Sun Devils have] got some big guys on the blue line, but I thought they battled and kept their feet moving, and did a lot of good things.”
Early on in the middle frame, ASU sophomore defenseman Joshua Maniscalco was whistled for hooking, giving Harvard its first powerplay of the night. It took the Crimson less than 30 seconds to find the back of the net. Puck movement in the offensive zone saw the biscuit find sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone at the point. Prawdzik, effectively screened, could not make the stop. Sophomore Evan DeBrouwer replaced the first-year in net thereafter.
The 3-0 deficit spurred a quick response from the Sun Devils, though. Not long after Rathbone’s tally, Maniscalco’s own shot from the point resulted in ASU’s first goal of the night. A minute later, sophomore forward Austin Lemieux buried a rebound in front of the net, bringing the score to 3-2. For the first time all weekend, the Sun Devils stood within a goal of Harvard.
Before ASU mounted its full-fledged comeback, the Crimson extended its lead. A cross-ice flip pass from Dornbach in his own zone found a streaking Abruzzese, who cut between the Sun Devils defensemen and went five-hole on DeBrouwer. The tally is the first-year’s fourth goal in four straight contests, extending his point streak to five games (4–2—6).
The final period, however, was all ASU. Harvard’s 4-2 advantage was erased by tallies from junior forward William Knierem and sophomore forward PJ Marrocco. The first 5-on-5 OT frame was goalless, so the game officially ended as a 4-4 tie. In an additional 3-on-3 period, however, the Crimson earned a powerplay in the closing minutes. Junior defenseman Reilly Walsh shot the puck from the top of the right circle, and Dornbach redirected it past DeBrouwer to earn the “win.”
“We talked about [having an extra 3-on-3 period],” coach Donato said. “By NCAA rules, the first five minutes is really all that matters, and then we played the 3-on-3. I think you’d have a hard time convincing me that that’s not exciting.”
Offensive contributions continue from the likes of Abruzzese and Dornbach, who is fifth in the NCAA in points per game (1.42). Though Harvard’s goal-scoring has cooled since the start of the year, the team still averages above four goals per game, good for second in the country. Rookie goaltender Mitchell Gibson’s performance on Sunday was among his worst of the season, though his overall numbers continue to impress (.931 SV%, 2.38 GAA).
HARVARD 4, ARIZONA STATE 1
The Crimson’s scoring came in a burst on Saturday as well; this time, however, the Sun Devils were unable to respond — in large part because of Gibson, who would end up turning aside 43 of 44 shots on the night (.977 SV%). The first period was scoreless, despite a Harvard powerplay opportunity midway through the frame.
“I know the shots were 12-8 [in the first] but I thought we had, like, six grade-A opportunities,” coach Donato said. “I felt like we were just looking for the perfect pass, and passed the puck out of prime shooting areas four or five times.”
Early on in the second, the Crimson was swarming around the ASU net. From behind the cage, Kerfoot dished the puck to Siedem at the boards, who passed to Wong in the slot. Wong’s one-timer zipped past DeBrouwer — the rookie’s first career goal came in his first college game.
Harvard found its next tally less than a minute later. Captain and forward Nathan Krusko collected the puck after a net-mouth scramble, looking to hand off to junior forward Henry Bowlby in the low slot; though a sprawled-out DeBrouwer stopped that attempt, he could not prevent junior Jack Badini from tucking in the rebound.
“Personally, I felt pretty good,” Badini said. “My legs felt good, felt like in midseason form. So that was important for us...getting back in the swing of things… Once the second period came around we were clicking on all cylinders.”
The Sun Devils had opportunities of their own in the second period. The most promising of these came on the powerplay, as Gibson fought off a redirected shot and the ensuing stuff attempt.
The Crimson killed off that penalty and retaliated with a goal, as Dornbach picked off a pass in the offensive zone and fired a shot that DeBrouwer struggled to hold onto; the rebound trickled into the slot, where Dornbach took a second chop at it. The puck carrommed over the net-minder and into the net, giving Harvard a 3-0 lead.
Gibson’s shutout bid was broken early into the third period, however. ASU began the final frame on the powerplay after the Crimson was whistled for too many men at the end of the second, and a point shot from Maniscalco put his team on the board.
“In the third period they turned it up,” said coach Donato. “They’re a good hockey team, well-coached, so we knew there was going to be a push. For us, we’re young in a lot of areas and we’re still learning how to close out a game and how to make things easier on ourselves. Tonight we didn’t do a great job, taking some penalties.”
The last tally of the game was Harvard’s, though, coming at the six-minute mark. Farinacci battled three Sun Devils players at the boards, stealing the puck and passing to Abruzzese at the goal line. Left all alone, Abruzzese skated in on Prawdzik, who had replaced DeBrouwer between the pipes, and outwaited the goaltender before tucking the puck home, far-side.
More than half the period remained. Though ASU had multiple powerplay opportunities, the Crimson effectively shut down its opponent — Maniscalco’s goal would be the only time the Sun Devils capitalised on the man advantage all weekend.
“[Gibson’s] been the brick wall for us since the start of the year,” rookie defenseman Henry Thrun said. “He’s just gained confidence as he’s gone. So it’s huge as a defenseman, knowing he’s back there behind us.”
