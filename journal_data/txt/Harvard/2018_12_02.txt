After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Crimes of Grindelwald,” the second installment in J.K. Rowling’s “Fantastic Beasts” series and prequel to the Harry Potter series, bears many delightful Easter eggs from the Potter universe: a spry and cheeky young Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), a nostalgic visit to the Hogwarts Castle, and the hallowed Mirror of Erised, which reflects one’s deepest desire. The first film followed the unassuming hero Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) through New York as he collected information for his forthcoming textbook on magical beasts, which effected the capture of the rogue wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), and set the scene for a sequel.
But the film, despite its highly anticipated revelations, was also plagued with a non-insignificant amount of controversy. The revelation that the South Korean actress Claudia Kim would play Nagini, Voldemort’s pet snake and one of his Horcruxes (physical hosts for fragments of his soul that needed to be destroyed before Harry could vanquish him), sparked a firestorm of internet controversy among Harry Potter fanatics. Fans raised ethical concerns about killing Nagini if she had a residual human consciousness, and also worried that Kim would be siloed as the archetypal Asian dragon-lady. They called out Rowling’s half-hearted retrofitting of “woke” backstories to her characters, since she only revealed that Dumbledore is gay after releasing the last Harry Potter book. The potential problem, though, with a film that is heralded by so much press is that it can get summarily dismissed before it can be received with an open mind.
The sheer volume of detail that Rowling is able to conjure and build upon in the first place, despite the tight logic of the Harry Potter stories, is a feat in itself. It’s simply enjoyable to burrow into the details of her world, just as Newt’s niffler, a tittering, mischievous platypus-like creature leaps into piles of shiny trinkets. It might do one well to forget for a moment that the franchise is probably a ploy by the Rowling industrial complex to ensure the continued indulgence of Harry Potter fans and will likely become wearisome in its third iteration — which is promised by a cliffhanger — and to admire the sensuousness of Rowling’s magical spectacles.
“The Crimes of Grindelwald” picks up where the first film left off, although the focus is less on Newt and rather on a tangled web of untimely encounters, awkward reunions, and unexpected connections. The enigmatic opening scenes are rendered exquisitely through CGI and the plummeting thrill of the chariot chase that ensues can be experienced as viscerally as Harry Potter’s first ride in his flying Ford Anglia. Due to the damage that Newt wrought on his previous quest, the British Ministry of Magic threatens to discipline him with an international travel ban unless he joins their forces. Its ranks include his buttoned-up war-hero brother Theseus (Callum Turner), with whom the eccentric Newt has a complicated relationship, not least since Theseus became engaged to Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), Newt’s close but now-estranged friend from Hogwarts. However, duty calls when Grindelwald escapes from prison and starts in hot pursuit of Credence (Ezra Miller), a boy with supernatural powers, and Dumbledore appoints Newt to find him in Paris before Grindelwald can recruit him to his cause. Grindelwald plans to violently restore power to pure-blooded wizards over the non-magique (the French term for the non-magically gifted), who have systematically discriminated against wizards and have even instated laws that prohibit their inter-marriage. It seems that Rowling has reprised her affinity for quests as propulsive plot devices and for unwittingly powerful, soulful orphans as her centerpieces, as Credence had a tumultuous upbringing in loveless foster homes and embarks on a search for his birth mother and for the truth about his identity.
The J.K. Rowling imprimatur guarantees emotionally compelling storylines and complicated characters who nurse dark pasts, as is the case with basically every central character in this film. There is a lot, thematically and technically, that Rowling juggles somewhat clumsily as a screenwriter, compared to the relatively straightforward first film, which felt like a wondrous trolley ride that even made time for Newt to enact an erumpent (a rhino-elephant hybrid with a glowing horn) mating dance. Dumbledore makes a slapdash admission about his sexuality when he addresses his boyhood friendship with Grindelwald, distinguishing them as “closer than brothers.” This curt nod to Rowling’s momentous reveal is vexingly imprecise, hardly perceptible to the uninitiated as well as tackily on-the-nose to devout Harry Potter fans. Grindelwald’s fascist agenda is heavy-handedly redolent of the modern political climate, with his fear-mongering and claims to victimhood. When he declares, “The old ways serve us no longer,” he might as well distribute bumper stickers that read, “Make Wizards Great Again.” Rowling’s overindulgence in character exposition to the effect of a bloated plot manifests in a confusing digression where the characters nearly partake in a bloody family feud.
1920’s Paris, where most of the action takes place, has the romantically grungy aspect one would expect, and Newt’s menagerie of magical creatures, like a majestic kelp dragon and a giant cat with a sparkling mane, attest to Rowling’s peerless gift for world-building. Fussy fans aside, the stellar acting and Yates’s impressive stagecraft are enough to recommend the film. Kravitz is a perfectly mysterious, tortured Leta and Redmayne manages Newt’s bumbling yet charming indirections with ingenious expressiveness. It’s remarkable that Rowling’s constellation of characters coheres as well as it does; she creates real emotional resonances between their epic, intersecting histories in the same way she endeared millions to the sprawling, complex world of Harry Potter. Rowling goes the extra mile with this origin story, unleashing a deluge of details and bewildering plot-detours, but better that than vague, hand-wavy lore that might do injustice to her legendary characters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a riveting fourth game, Harvard sophomore John Finley Ong fought back from a deficit to delight the crowd by winning a nail-biting game and tying his match at 2-2. It was the loudest the crowd got all afternoon, but it was not enough for Ong, who ended up losing the fifth game handily.
That was about the only thing that went wrong Friday for the No. 2 Crimson (3-0), who thrashed MIT 8-1 in the Murr Center for a third straight easy win to start the season.
The next-most exciting match took place at the same time on the furthest-away court, where senior Rana Bansal roared back from a 2-0 deficit to eek out the third game and then take the fourth and fifth, ensuring that Harvard would go at least 8-1 for the third consecutive match.
“Rana had a great comeback,” sophomore Samuel Scherl said. “He was down and won in five, that was awesome.”
The other seven matches lacked the same level of intrigue that came with Ong’s and Bansal’s. The Crimson swept all seven, with the gap in talent evident pretty early on in most of the matches. Freshman Marwan Tarek, playing from the No.1 position, was especially impressing, wowing the crowd with difficult shot after difficult shot en route to a smooth victory in which he only allowed 11 points.
Tarek was one of two freshmen who played Friday. On an adjacent court, freshman George Crowne took a little while to warm up, falling behind in the first game before battling back to take that one and the next two for good measure.
“They [the freshmen] are looking really strong and really composed,” junior captain Timothy Brownell said. “They’re playing beyond their years and I’m really impressed so far. If they can just stay the course, it’s looking like a good season so far.”
While the first three matches of the season have not been especially competitive, they still serve as valuable experiences for everyone, particularly the freshmen.
“I think it’s been great getting the freshmen used to college matches in less intense situations,” Scherl said. “It’s hard when you’re playing at Trinity and there are 150 Trinity people yelling and getting in your face. It’s an easier way to ease into college competition and see what it’s like.”
Brownell, playing from the No. 2 position, and Scherl, No. 3, both matched Tarek’s dominant performance, ceding just 11 points each in their respective matches. They both looked assured from the get-go, jumping out to healthy leads in each game and winning wire-to-wire.
“I thought my movement was pretty good,” Brownell said. “It was my first match this season competitively, so it just felt really good to be out there wearing the jersey.”
Harvard was sure not to underestimate MIT(6-3) despite the gap in quality between the two teams.
“It’s about taking everyone seriously and preparing well,” Brownell said. “For these guys [MIT] we’re one of the biggest matches of the year, so they come out to play hard and we’ve got to respect them.”
This was the last of three matches against Boston-area rivals, and the Crimson took care of all three with ease, winning by a combined 25-2. Now, though, the going will get tougher, as the Harvard’s last match before a month-long gap comes next Wednesday against No.7 Dartmouth (1-0). The Big Green will be the best opponent the Crimson has faced all season, and it will also be Harvard’s first Ivy League match.
The Crimson will hope to match last year’s dominant 9-0 victory over Dartmouth. It will seek the return of a few injured players, one of whom, junior Saadeldin Abouaish, played from the No. 1 position in that match last year and came back from a 2-1 deficit to edge out his opponent 3-2.
“I think when we get our injured guys back in the lineup we’re going to be a notch better,” Scherl said.
After the Dartmouth match, Harvard will have played a lot more matches (four) before the semester break than it has historically (usually no more than two). Scherl downplayed the significance of this schedule shift and went on to say that he has been happy with the team’s early preparations this season.
“We’re using every match as an opportunity to identify some gaps and weaknesses and fix those,” Scherl said. “Over the course of the season we’ve gotten a lot fitter – fitness has been a big component this year.”
The national championship hopefuls will look to use that enhanced fitness to cruise into the semester break at 4-0. The Crimson’s match against Dartmouth starts at 5 pm Wednesday at the Murr Center courts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a back-and-forth matchup where momentum swings reigned, Harvard men’s basketball’s early offensive struggles paired with Siena’s runs just before and after halftime ultimately sunk the Crimson in Times Union Center in Albany, N.Y.,. Despite a few late comeback attempts, Harvard’s efforts were too little, too late to overtake the Saints.
“We dug ourselves a hole, and we didn’t play particularly well in the first half, and I thought that spilled over somewhat into the second half,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “We had some life and tried to dig out at the end.”
The Crimson was finally able to break the back-and-forth play of the game with a pair of consecutive second-half threes from junior guard Christian Juzang, bringing the score to 54-48. Harvard’s momentum was short-lived, however, as Siena struck with explosive back-to-back dunks within 31 seconds to extend the lead to 10 points and reclaim the energy of the game. This departure from the see-saw play that defined much of the second half proved to be an exception, as the Saints’ reclaimed momentum would last for another five minutes.
With 2:32 left to play in the game, the Crimson (4-4) broke the game’s standstill once again and found new life on a three-pointer from sophomore guard Rio Haskett. Junior wing Justin Bassey then contributed his own three-point play, this one the old fashioned way, knocking down a layup and completing the and-one opportunity by sinking his free-throw.
Siena (3-5), despite earlier struggles from the line, was able to do enough with its late free-throw opportunities to keep its lead into the final minute of play.
Free-throws were an issue for both sides, with the Saints and Harvard both having dismal performances from the line. Siena was 9-17 from the stripe, and the Crimson only made 7-14 free shots. These struggles especially manifested at the end of the contest, for both sides. It was a miss from the Saints, however, that made the final seconds competitive.
A Siena missed free-throw with 23 seconds to play kept Harvard in the game. A rebound by sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic lead to a missed layup by Bassey, but Djuricic was there to follow up the miss with a tip-in. Djuricic was fouled on the tip-in, and converted on his free-throw. Holding onto a fragile three-point lead, the Saints took a timeout to regroup.
The stoppage in play was not enough to keep the Crimson off of its back, as Siena turned the ball over quickly. Following Juzang’s steal, Bassey pulled up for a final shot, but his attempt to tie the game from behind the arc was no good, and Siena took the game 67-64.
In contrast to the latter period, the first half was offensively challenged, as each team struggled to put the ball in the basket. Both teams shot under 40 percent from the field, as Harvard shot 36 percent while the Saints made a slightly better 37.9 percent of its shots. Of the Crimson’s 25 shots, 10 came from beyond the arc. This reliance on outside shot attempts could be due in part to the continued absence of junior forward Chris Lewis, who missed his third straight game, having previously sat out Harvard’s victories over Saint Mary’s and Holy Cross.
Despite the halftime score of 27-22 in Siena’s favor, the Crimson actually controlled much of the opening period. Harvard led the Saints for 65 percent of the first half, holding it for the last time until the break when Siena drilled a three-pointer to take the lead 20-19. The Saints would hold onto this lead into halftime, stretching it to five points with 37 seconds left on the clock. This would be its largest lead of the half.
The Crimson came out of the gates running, despite allowing the first points of the game. Harvard quickly struck back in the opening minute of the contest with a triple from senior captain Corey Johnson. Junior forward Henry Welsh and Bassey followed with quick buckets of their own. The reminder of the first half was mostly back-and-forth play, until Siena seized control of the momentum near the end of the period.
With just over five minutes left to play in the first half, the Saints started their tear from outside the arc. In the span of 2:03, three different Siena players knocked down three separate three pointers, interrupted only by a Crimson dunk from junior forward Robert Baker. A three-pointer from freshman guard Noah Kirkwood was Harvard’s only way to slow down the attack near the end of the half, keeping the Saints’ late run to marginal 8-3.
“I thought they played harder and more together than we did,” Amaker said. “And that was the difference.”
Following the break, the two squads returned to the back-and-forth play that dominated the first half, alternating for the first six baskets of the period. Siena first broke this streak with 16:15 left, following up a jumper with a three-pointer and denying the Crimson the opportunity to continue trading points. Not to be outdone, Johnson responded with a quick triple of his own. After a pair of baskets from the Saints made the game 41-31, the lead would hover around the low double-digits for the next seven minutes, with easier side able to string together any scoring runs and gain ground on the opposition. Despite Harvard’s late runs that pulled it close, Siena did not relinquish the lead it seized late in the first half for the remainder of the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A late-regulation comeback and 27-point effort by junior guard Katie Benzan wasn’t quite enough for Harvard’s women’s basketball (4-4) Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, who dropped 72-67 to Quinnipiac (4-3) in a double-overtime thriller to open its four-game homestand.
Down 52-44 with seven minutes to play in regulation, senior guard Madeline Raster went on a late-game tear, including hitting a triple with three minutes left to bring the Crimson within striking distance at 57-54. A Quinnipiac layup put the Bobcats up 59-54, but Benzan quickly responded with a deep three with a minute left in regulation to keep the game at 59-57.
A Harvard stop on defense gave the Crimson the ball back with 28 seconds to play, who fed the ball to their hot hand in Benzan. Benzan drove hard to the basket in the final seconds, but the ball sailed out of bounds off Quinnipiac with 1.1 seconds left.
Needing a two to send the game to overtime, Benzan inbounded the ball to Raster, who nailed a buzzer-beating baseline jumper over a Bobcat defender to close out regulation.
“We all knew she was going to make [the shot],” Benzan said. “We all believed in her and that was just a magnificent shot over two defenders, and she just had the mental toughness to lock in and nail it.”
Harvard continued to carry that late-game momentum into overtime, racing out to a 64-59 lead with a minute left, including off a scrappy dive from sophomore forward Jadyn Bush to set up Benzan with a deep three.  Benzan finished 7-12 from distance.
“Jadyn just did a great hustle play, like we were talking about getting those 50-50 balls and she dove on the floor and kicked it out to me, and I shot it, and thankfully it went in,” Benzan said.
The Bobcats weren’t done yet though, as they rallied back and finished the period with their own buzzer-beating heroics with a three to tie the game at 65 and send it to a second overtime.
Harvard’s magical run didn’t quite make it into the second overtime, as it fell behind 72-67 to close out the game, giving the ball away on a few critical possessions. Turnovers proved costly on the night overall for the Crimson, who finished the game with 23 turnovers in spite of outboarding Quinnipiac 50-35 and finishing with a 42.9 field-goal percentage, compared to the Bobcats’ 35.6 percent.
“They did a really nice job getting in our passing lanes and taking our sets away from us...we were frenetic and played at a pace that was too fast,” Delaney-Smith said.  “We can’t turn the ball over 23 times and beat a team like Quinnipiac, and so to oversimplify things, we lacked the discipline to run a play and get to the end of the play.”
The finish may be difficult to digest for the team, but Harvard will move on towards its next contest, a home stint against Maine on Tuesday.
“There are always learning experiences in every game, but especially in losses,” Benzan said.  “Going down the stretch when it’s a neck and neck game, you have to be mentally tough every single play.”
