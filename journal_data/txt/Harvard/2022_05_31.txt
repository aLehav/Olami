After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the sun set over the Harvard Athletic Complex, crowds flocked to the Delta Air Lines Blue Stage to witness the Boston Calling debut of pop-punk princess Avril Lavigne.
Following an audience-led sing-along to “Dear Maria, Count Me In,” an anxious quiet fell over the crowd. The anticipation built as Lavigne’s logo popped up on screen and the band walked on stage. Both the logo and the silence shattered when Lavigne’s shout of “Hey you” rang out as she opened the set with an energetic rendition of “Bite Me.”
The singer’s set served as a time capsule that preserved the style, sound, and energy of the mid-2000’s emo punk scene. Lavigne’s band sported matching blazers paired with spiked jewelry and early ’00s fringe and mohawks.  It was a crew that wouldn’t have looked out of place as the emo friend group in a high school romcom. The squad was completed as Lavigne took the stage. Sporting platinum blonde hair with neon pink ends and heavy smudged eyeliner, the singer channeled the classic ’00s emo aesthetic that she helped to establish.
Lavigne comes to Boston Calling as a leader of the pop-punk renaissance. Fueled by the success of songs like Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 You” and Machine Gun Kelly’s “my ex’s best friend,” the genre has made an emphatic return to the mainstream. While Lavigne’s 2019 song “Head Above Water” received mixed reviews from audiences and critics, February’s “Love Sux” has been applauded as a return to form for the artist widely considered to be rock royalty. The warm reception was evident among attendees who sang along to new tracks like “Bite Me” and “Love it When You Hate Me.”
“This song goes out to anyone who's been around since day one,” said Lavigne while introducing “Complicated.” Released in 2002 as her first entry to the music industry, the song today represents a celebration of Lavigne's 20 year career. The track seemed fresh as ever as the entire crowd — an eclectic mix of 20-somethings and middle aged rock dads — sang along to every word.
The set benefitted significantly from Lavigne's lengthy career, over which she has built up an impressive collection of Top 40 earworms.  With the performance coming in at just under an hour, it was a non-stop showcase of Avril Lavigne’s greatest hits.  From the rebellious teen perspective of “What the Hell” to the spiteful “Sk8er Boi,” the crowd rode the wave of nostalgia as they jumped, danced, and sang along.
The highlight of the show was Lavigne’s performance of “Girlfriend.” From the high energy chorus to the rhythmic breakdown on the bridge, the song showcased Lavigne in her element. In the loudest festival moment yet, the crowd screamed out “hell yeah, I’m the motherfucking princess” while pointing to the artist on stage.
Audience members were treated with a surprise appearance by MOD SUN, who Lavigne brought out as a special guest midway through the performance. Together the duo performed “Flames”, an angst filled duet featuring Lavigne from MOD SUN’s 2021 album “Internet Killed the Rockstar.” In a set that at times lacked energy, MOD SUN injected the audience with some much needed exuberance.
While the hour-long journey into the past left the audience pondering who and where they were when these songs were released, outdated references and resurfaced high school memories weren’t the only reasons to cringe. Lavigne continues to use a remixed version of her song “Hello Kitty” as she transitioned between parts of the set.  The song, as well as its accompanying music video, faced backlash when released for appropriating and objectifying Japanese culture. With Hello Kitty artwork stylized in her signature pop-punk aesthetic flashing on the screen behind the stage, the track continues to feel inappropriate and out of place nearly a decade after the song's 2013 release.
Lavigne closed out the show by slowing it down and showing off her vocal strength through a performance of “I’m With You.”  After a lengthy applause full of cheers and shouts, the audience filed out, heading back to the main stage for the final performance of the night. As Greenday’s “Basket Case” played over the speakers, the audience sang along as they left, not quite ready to leave the past behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
City manager finalist Iram Farooq — the only candidate currently working in the city government — describes Cambridge in her candidate questionnaire as “a mecca of learning, an engine of innovation, of commerce, and economic opportunity.” All of this, she writes, makes Cambridge “uniquely positioned to lead.”
Cambridge’s Initial Screening Committee announced four finalists who will move forward in the search for a new city manager earlier this month: Iram Farooq, Cheryl Watson Fisher, Yi-An Huang ’05, and Norman Khumalo.
Farooq has served as Cambridge’s assistant city manager for community development since 2015 and has worked in the city’s Community Development Department since 1999.
Farooq — who holds a master’s in landscape architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and a bachelor’s in architecture — previously served as a land use planner and parks designer.
In her application, Farooq describes her commitment to furthering her work at the CDD on affordable housing and sustainability — work she claims allowed Cambridge to be recognized as a leader in these fields.
Farooq highlighted social justice, transportation, and “enhancement of the arts” as her priorities for the city, citing related initiatives she has worked on at the CDD.
In addition to continuing work in housing and sustainability, Farooq lists several policy “priority areas,” which include promoting digital equity, furthering access to early childhood education, building a collaborative team of city leaders, and developing “trauma-informed law enforcement and restorative justice.”
Farooq noted her “positive working relationship” with the City Council in her questionnaire responses.
“I prioritize keeping the City Council’s goals front and center in my work and the work of my team,” Farooq wrote.
Farooq cited past experiences advising the Council and creating a budget for the CDD that was “consistent with and responsive to City Council goals.”
In the past, city councilors and Cambridge residents have criticized Cambridge’s form of government for delegating more power to the appointed city manager as opposed to the elected representatives. The City Council began a charter review process in July 2020.
Farooq writes that her “bold long-term vision” for the city involves creating “a livable, sustainable, equitable, resilient and just city.”
“I am proud to call Cambridge my home for over twenty years,” Farooq writes in her cover letter. “I am excited at the possibility of continuing to serve the Cambridge community over the coming years in the even more meaningful role of City Manager.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Affordable housing, climate change, universal pre-K, and equity — these are just a few of the issues that Cambridge city manager finalist Cheryl Watson Fisher said she hopes to tackle if appointed in June.
Cambridge’s Initial Screening Committee announced four finalists who will move forward in the search for a new city manager earlier this month: Iram Farooq, Cheryl Watson Fisher, Yi-An Huang ’05, and Norman Khumalo.
Fisher currently serves as Chelsea’s city solicitor and previously served as Cambridge’s assistant city solicitor.
“I have been in the management of a city — a little smaller than Cambridge, but right here in the metro Boston area — for 18 years,” Fisher said in an interview.
In response to a question in the city’s candidate questionnaire about experiences relevant to Cambridge’s priorities, Fisher cited her past work on issues such as anti-racism, transportation, and promotion of the arts when asked about experiences relevant to Cambridge’s priorities.
These initiatives included a “bus/bike lane down the main avenue in Chelsea,” the revival of “Chelsea Day, a full day of the arts celebrating the city,” and efforts to re-start the Human Rights Commission, a group “that oversees possible discrimination in private workplaces and other industries.”
As for Cambridge, Fisher said in an interview that she is focused on improving residents’ quality of life.
“All people need to have a quality of life that they all want to enjoy,” Fisher said. “Whether it be housing, bike lanes, affordable food and groceries, a universal income — all of this makes a better community for everyone.”
Asked about her policy interests, Fisher said affordable housing was her “number one priority” and connected its importance to “equity and inclusion.”
While Fisher said that she was “impressed” by Cambridge’s efforts to combat climate change, she said she would push for more initiatives.
“I believe that Cambridge can do more,” she said. “Cambridge could be greener and more resilient and have more projects in place on the community level.”
Fisher also said she hopes to further the policing alternative laid out by outgoing City Manager Louis A. DePasquale in the proposed budget for fiscal year 2023. This alternative — known as the Community Safety Department — would provide “non-police response to non-violent and behavioral crisis calls.”
Asked in an interview why she chose to apply to be city manager, Fisher cited her personal connection to the city as a former resident and a graduate of the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, saying she was “proud to be from Cambridge.”
“What a great opportunity to become the manager of a city I grew up in,” Fisher said. “I’m a Cambridge girl, Cambridge heart — That’s who I am.”

City manager finalist Norman Khumalo said he is driven to Cambridge as a “community in transition” in his candidate questionnaire. Cambridge, he wrote, is “pursuing contemporary ideals and in some cases losing ground on gains achieved in the past.”
Cambridge’s Initial Screening Committee announced four finalists who will move forward in the search for a new city manager earlier this month: Iram Farooq, Cheryl Watson Fisher, Yi-An Huang ’05, and Norman Khumalo.
Khumalo is currently the town manager in Hopkinton, a role he has held since 2009. Previously, he served in management and planning roles in the governments of Westford, Walpole, Wellesley, and Lawrence in Massachusetts. He also worked as a senior town planner in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.
In his resume, Khumalo, who declined an interview request, describes himself as a “highly talented town manager” who “seeks to apply his extensive skills to a municipal organization.”
Earlier this year, Khumalo was named one of three finalists for Watertown’s city manager but was not selected for the role.
The cover letter he submitted for the Watertown position, which was made public by the Watertown City Council, is nearly identical — with the exception of several minor changes in phrasing — to the one he submitted for Cambridge.
Khumalo says in his Cambridge candidate questionnaire that he is “inspired by Cambridge’s commitment to addressing income inequality, social change, social justice, equity, and anti-racism.” He also highlights affordable housing, public transportation, and sustainability as other top priorities.
Some of Khumalo’s past initiatives described in his application included establishing “the first public transportation routes in Westford and in Hopkinton” and introducing the Dial-A-Ride program for elderly residents. He also detailed projects designed to mitigate climate change — what he describes as Hopkinton’s “strategic priority” — such as a stormwater management plan and adding more green space in Hopkinton developments.
When prompted to describe his leadership style in the questionnaire, Khumalo centered his description around “Ubuntu.” Khumalo describes the philosophy as an understanding that “as human beings, we are attached in every respect.”
He frequently employs the term “balance” to describe his leadership principles — balancing “confidence with humility,” “a desire to accomplish with patience,” and “hard work with having a joyful experience.”
“The pandemic has strengthened my belief in ‘Ubuntu,’” Khumalo writes. “Especially concerning the need to be holistically human-centered, to better understand my colleagues, and residents, including placing their needs, aspirations, resilience, wellness front and center in my daily routines with renewed enthusiasm.”

City Manager Finalist Yi-An Huang ’05 — if appointed in June — said he hopes to spur Cambridge to “be more ambitious and act with greater urgency.”
Cambridge’s Initial Screening Committee announced four finalists who will move forward in the search for a new city manager earlier this month: Iram Farooq, Cheryl Watson Fisher, Yi-An Huang ’05, and Norman Khumalo.
Huang, who currently serves as the Boston Medical Center Hospital’s executive director of clinical operations, has spent the majority of his career focused on promoting health care both nationally and globally.
In an interview, Huang said he sees several parallels between his work in health care administration and the work of the city manager.
“I saw some of these parallels around ‘How do you take an organization that’s done a lot of great things and really build on that?’” Huang said. “And, ‘How do you get to the next level?’”
While Huang said his health care management experience has “parallels operationally” to the role of city manager, he said he “recognize[s] that there are a lot of nuances to city, municipal government, urban planning and design.”
“Of the candidates, I am the one who is coming without direct city management background,” Huang said. “I would definitely approach this role with a lot of humility.”
Huang cited the city’s Covid-19 response and the guaranteed income initiative as some of Cambridge’s recent strengths.
Huang highlighted climate change, housing affordability, universal pre-K, and digital equity as issues that could use additional attention. However, Huang said he would not “articulate a really specific personal agenda” going into the role.
In a city candidate questionnaire, Huang responded to prompts asking about experience with various city priorities — including anti-racism, environmental issues, and promotion of the arts — with a combination of professional and personal experiences.
He described his experience leading diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at Boston Medical Center — including anti-racism and implicit bias training — and argued that the Center’s “path to carbon neutrality” could be a model for achieving Cambridge’s environmental goals.
Huang also recounted when he welcomed a group of Afghan refugees to live in his Cambridge home. Huang wrote that the refugees’ struggle with navigating Cambridge’s market for affordable housing “underlined the challenges we face as a city.”
In his candidate questionnaire, Huang said his motivation for applying to be City Manager stemmed from his career focus in public service and belief in the city’s goals.
“I have a personal stake in the future of this community,” Huang wrote. “It would be a privilege to serve and shape the future of the city.”
