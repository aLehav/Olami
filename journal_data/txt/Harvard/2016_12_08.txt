After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her latest and longest work to date, the much-acclaimed author Sabina Murray set out to write a “500-page meditation on colonialism.” The result is both half as intelligent and half as interesting as the phrase suggests. “Valiant Gentlemen” attempts to immerse its reader in histories both personal and political to explore relationships and revolutions in the rapidly changing world of the 19th century. Spanning several continents and decades, the storyline of “Valiant Gentlemen” has the potential to develop into a gripping literary narrative and discussion of colonialism and conquest in Africa and South America; instead, Murray delivers a light, readable novel that—while occasionally entertaining—stops short of becoming something truly powerful.  Murray’s style lets down the potential of her content; despite her strong ability to develop memorable characters, her narrative often falls victim to an overabundance of context, a cloying sentimentality, and an underdeveloped prose style.
Set in 1886, “Valiant Gentlemen” is a fictionalized retelling of the 30-year friendship between Herbert Ward, an English explorer and artist, and Roger Casement, an Irish-born diplomat and humanitarian activist. The two met as young men in 1884 while working for the Sanford Exploring Company in what was then known as the Congo Free State (the Belgian-controlled forerunner of today’s Democratic Republic of Congo). A teenage runaway, Ward had held a variety of oddball jobs even before his stint in Africa—coal and gold miner, stock-rider, and circus performer—after which he went on to marry Argentinian heiress Sarita Sanford and have a successful career as an artist in Europe. Casement came from a poor family in Ireland but managed to carve out a career in diplomacy as an agent of the English government after working for commercial interests in the Congo. After years in the diplomatic service, he compiled reports on the Belgian abuse of natives in the Congo and the rubber enslavement of Peruvian Indians, which had wide-reaching impacts on the cultural dialogue surrounding imperialism in the United Kingdom (and were later immortalized in James Joyce’s “Ulysses”). Despite his early work for the British, Casement later became  a fervent Irish nationalist and spent much of his later life working to further the goal of Irish home rule.
The book’s redeeming quality is Murray’s charismatic sketches of these historical figures. Murray develops these larger-than-life characters into believable, likeable people—a technique that is essential in a story that progresses over several hundred pages. The only way to draw a reader into a book as long as this one is to create characters power enough to drive a complex plot; there is no room for weak or ineffectual characters because their personalities are sustaining the work. It also is no small feat to convince a reader to sympathize with men and women whose motivations are linked to long-dead political causes and a world long since past. Few writers are able to make a modern reader feel connected to the interior life of a minor figure of the Irish Home Rule movement or interested in the politics of the Belgian Congo.
Her style, however, has an irritating quirk—it seems to analyze the action of the plot as it unfolds. It does not simply present its ideas and characters to the reader but also, annoyingly, tells the reader what to think about them: “Ward is going to have to get used to it, because marriage is all about the person in the other room, or the other person in the same room, the other, who, like a volcano, can threaten to explode across one’s landscape.” Making this comparison outright is not an awful way to get the point across; but a more sophisticated approach would be to write the novel well enough that the parallel between volcanoes and marriages comes to the reader without outright suggestion.
Another problem in “Valiant Gentlemen” is Murray’s orientation of the reader to somewhat obscure elements of European history. One of the drawbacks to telling a story as deeply rooted in history as this one is that the plot requires an enormous amount of context. The background information inserted into otherwise complete paragraphs of prose reads awkwardly; it throws off the flow of the narrative when a phrase explaining the factional violence in Africa suddenly makes an appearance within a description of a spring day. Maybe this slightly sloppy technique is a necessary evil for keeping the narrative rolling when the author aims to discuss so much; Murray covers an extensive amount of historical material as the story follows colonization attempts in Africa and South America, as well as the swift unraveling of Europe as World War I approaches.
Despite its length, the plot of “Valiant Gentlemen” possesses an exciting momentum from the beginning: From one moment to the next, Ward’s and Casement’s adventures become transporting as Ward and Casement hunt elephants, escape cannibals, and negotiate with world powers. But the story wanders away from the adventurous into the overly sentimental from time to time. Murray’s writing is the weakest in the narrative’s most emotional moments. At an early emotional climax in the book, Ward finally realizes the depth of his attachment to Sarita Sanford. The realization comes to him as he watches her play with her young nephew in the park, skipping and pretending to be a horse: “Ward hadn’t been in love with her. He had appreciated her, like a well-sighted rifle or an excellent wine. Maybe it was seeing her gallop down the street, unconcerned.” As this excerpt makes clear, this novel hits its high points when it tries to deliver action and adventure; when Murray wanders into the realm of the emotional, things quickly become maudlin.
The worst thing one can say about this book is that it is somewhat mediocre, both in terms of style and content. Nothing in it is daring enough or of a high enough quality to earn it the title of being “literary”—it is essentially a really long beach read. There is nothing wrong with a novel being accessible or fun; however, the concept of beach reading is simply incompatible with the length of this work. The time invested in this novel demands a greater reward than it delivers. “Valiant Gentlemen” is no masterpiece, and maybe writing a masterpiece wasn’t the author’s intention. But all one can get out of it is an adventure yarn, no more and no less.

The University has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent since 2006, reaching a short-term goal University President Drew G. Faust set in 2008, according to a sustainability report released Thursday.
The Office for Sustainability implemented Faust’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent over 10 years, working with individual schools and departments to reduce emissions across the University. Faust appointed an executive committee of faculty experts and senior administrators to oversee the project.
“The standards and policies we put into place were clear but also allowed each school to determine how to do their energy audits and meet their standards,” Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the Office for Sustainability, said.
To begin the project, the Office for Sustainability partnered with a nonprofit organization to take an “emissions inventory” from over 600 buildings in North America and 25 million square feet of space. Ninety-seven percent of the University’s emissions come from “building electricity use, heating, and cooling,” according to the report.
On campus, while laboratories account for 46 percent of the University’s energy usage, they only occupy 22 percent of Harvard’s square footage, which the report says illustrates “the unique challenge that research-focused organizations face as they seek to reduce their emissions footprint.”
The University reduced its emissions by making buildings on campus more energy efficient, purchasing local renewable energy, shifting towards natural gas as an energy source, and improving refrigerant tracking and management, among other steps.
Building managers and facilities teams installed new heating and cooling systems and lighting in buildings across campus. Overall energy use on campus is down 10 percent since 2006 with campus growth factored in, according to the report.
“Climate change is a threat to our future, and it deserves nothing less than our best efforts in the present,” Faust wrote in a statement emailed to University affiliates.
Henriksen said the University-wide nature of the project helped make it successful.
“There aren't a lot of non-academic university-wide initiatives,” she said. “Because there was top-down support from the President and the Deans and bottom-up from the students, and our office in charge, it’s made it need to meet in the middle.”
Henriksen added that, moving forward, this “foundation” can be applied to other sustainability efforts.
“This is short-term, and there’s more to be done,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has made plenty of history when his Crimson teams have squared off with Boston College. In 2009, Harvard beat the Eagles in what was the program’s first ever win against a top 25 team. The victory was the first of six straight wins over BC, the longest Crimson run in a series that has featured 50 matchups dating back more than a century.
On Wednesday night at Conte Forum, Amaker added another notch on his belt as a 74-66 win over the Eagles gave the 10th-year head coach the most victories in program history with 179. Amaker passed his predecessor, Frank Sullivan, who led Harvard to 178 victories over 16 seasons in Cambridge.
“When we get a chance to reflect and let things settle we’ll probably let our minds race and run with some thoughts,” Amaker said. “We always felt coming aboard to Harvard was an amazing brand, amazing institution, and we just thought if we could somehow build our basketball program to try and match things that go on at Harvard we would feel very good about ourselves.”
Freshman forward Chris Lewis paced the Harvard effort with 22 points and five rebounds as the Crimson (4-4) held off a Jerome Robinson-led BC (4-4) rally in the game’s final minutes. After entering the second half holding a 16-point lead, Harvard kept BC at arm’s length for a majority of the final 20 minutes. Whenever the Eagles hit a shot to cut the lead, the Crimson had an answer on the other end. However, BC’s run-and-gun offense, consistently open looks, and ability to corral offensive rebounds made the double-digit lead never seem safe.
The Eagles had 20 points off of 14 Harvard turnovers and made 11 three-point field goals on the night. The Crimson began settling for shots and the jumpers Harvard’s defense was daring BC to take all night started finding the bottom of the net. Going into the penultimate media timeout, the Crimson lead was down to 11, and then with 5:17 to play, the Eagles were within single digits.
Both teams stayed off the scoreboard for over three minutes before Robinson sunk his third triple of the game. After another stop on the defensive end, BC had an opportunity to make it a one possession game, but his three was long. A Justin Bassey layup off of a Siyani Chambers deep pass proved to be the dagger for the hosts.
“Two veteran teams [Northeastern and BC], especially tonight, just wouldn’t give up on the floor which is really clear,” Chambers said. “Just need for us to continue to play our brand of basketball and continue to get better every day.”
Despite the rocky finish, Harvard had a cushion due to a strong showing in the game’s first 30 minutes. After missing its first two field goal attempts, the Crimson zeroed in in its second game in as many nights. Following freshman Seth Towns knocking down a three to kick off the scoring, Harvard jumped out to an 11-point lead by the game’s second media timeout.
The Crimson posted its second consecutive 46-point half in the first frame on Wednesday while shooting a blistering 57 percent from the field. Lewis, Towns, and classmate Bryce Aiken accounted for 33 of the first half points. Harvard went inside early and often on Wednesday, with 50 of its 74 points coming in the paint or from the charity stripe.
“As a freshman, I think we’ve really come together,” Lewis said. “Personally, I just have to learn my role and step into it. I’ve had great captains who’ve helped me see how to blend into the program and where to fit in.”
The Eagles’ start was marred by turnovers and missed jump shots. The Crimson lead peaked at 18 as Lewis was a menace down low and Towns showed off his versatility, peppering the BC defense with long balls, up-and-unders, turnarounds, and stepbacks. Robinson paced the Eagles’ offense with 25 points on 10-of-23 shooting but it was not enough to push the home team over the top.
Chambers posted his third consecutive double-digit assist performance and did not turn the ball over. It was the 73rd win for the on-court personification of Amaker, a fitting performance for a night in which Amaker, per usual, focused on his team and the people who helped him get to win number 179 rather than himself.
“I’m very proud of our team and certainly for these kids right now.” Amaker said. “You get a chance to look at those things as time goes by...but also you have had some amazing staff members and players that have come through the program. Proud to be a part of that with Harvard.”

Make America Great Again? More like Make Harvard Great Again.
With a string of recent athletic, social, and political misfortunes, many Harvard students have been left slightly dazed and confused about the outcome of 2016.  Well, our lives may be sad and miserable at the moment (with reading period and imminent exams the cherry on top of a long year), but Tiffany Trump’s life definitely isn’t.
A recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and aspiring lawyer (according to her Instagram, at least), Tiffany is perhaps better known as the younger daughter of Donald Trump, who in case you missed it is our country’s president-elect. Tiffany Trump is reported to have visited Harvard Law School this past Tuesday, with law students claiming that the tall blonde, with her posse of Secret Service agents, were unmistakable.
With many celebrities drawn to the prestige of a Harvard education, it doesn’t come as a surprise to us that Tiffany Trump is interested in Harvard as well. We’re interested to see how her father will react if she decides to attend Harvard for law school, especially given his past skirmishes with Harvard (namely with the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine) and resulting negative rhetoric about Harvard students being “fraudsters and liars”.
