After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since its inception in 1912, “Milk’s Favorite Cookie” has been around for over a hundred years, dominating CVS store shelves, and serving as the go-to snack for comp meetings, social gatherings, and late-night study sessions. The Oreo cookie has come in glossy blue packaging, in limited editions and countless varieties, with thick and thin stuffings, with flavors like birthday cake and lemon twist, and with bright colors of all sorts.
Despite its enticing packaging and crunchy savoriness, the vegan two-wafered cookie has given rise to heated debates between friends and family members, angry Redditors, YouTube commenters, and banterful Crimson Editorial editors. Each person has their own way of answering the question, “What is the right way to eat an Oreo?”
When properties such as bestness, properness, correctness, or rightness float into this question, in virtue of declaring that there is some golden standard way to eat an Oreo, we are making a normative statement. We hold claim to a higher, singular truth. Any deviation from this ideal pinpoint is often taken to be wrong or misguided, and to be discouraged, mocked, or rejected.
Certainly, the creators of Oreo, at least, intended the very opposite of this right-wrong dichotomy. In one of their promo commercials, the narrators chant to the backdrop of sparkly music, “... twist it, lick it, dunk it, munch it … roll it, stack it, flip it, crunch it … snack it, hack it, crack it, creme it … share it, dip it, dare it, dream it!” The video cheerily concludes, “It's an Oreo and you can eat it anyway. If you wanna, you can do it different every single day.”
The spirit of this ad encourages us to employ our creative freedom and imagination, playing with the Oreo in new ways rather than insisting that we all adhere to a single, rigid normative standard. It encourages us to distinguish preferences from other evaluation concepts that involve truth content.
Preferences are subjective and depend heavily on the pluralistic upbringings, backgrounds, and worldviews of each individual. Preferences can change over time, due to changing reactions, values, tastes, or some combination of these. Even if one approach to eating an Oreo, such as licking it bit by bit over the period of two hours, garners greater net hedonic utility for certain people, we need not enforce this norm across the board.
Some individuals might abide by different standards and cultural norms, and others might be subject to special circumstances, such as being pressed for time. But more importantly, there is a satisfaction to be gained in the action of willing one’s ends for oneself, and the very decision to commit to a choice over another is what confers value.
Thus, the question — “What is the right way to eat an Oreo?” — is itself misguided. It is predicated on the assumption that there is an objective standard of truth that ought to regiment our attitudes, beliefs, experiences, feelings, and activities. That every Oreo is exactly 71 percent cookie and 29 percent cream is a statement of a distinct nature than the claim that there is only one right way to eat an Oreo. There is no rightness or wrongness involved with dunking a chopped Oreo in skim milk, or with twisting off one side of the cookie and eating the filling first. We might try to rationalize or justify our preferences, but they need not be grounded in any appeal to truth.
More broadly, we should not be so quick to judge others on matters of mere preference. That one person is a devoted conservative does not mean that we should shun their opinions without taking them seriously. That one person decides to pursue the study of philosophy over the natural sciences need not bring about a tirade of criticism. The fact that we place ourselves upon this normative pedestal, a place of higher moral authority, to govern right and wrong over subjects that do not even fit this dichotomy is a mistake. Everyone’s putative preferences weigh equally, and paternalistic despotism is unwarranted.
Even if we completely disagree with others’ preferences and judgments, sometimes tolerance is the appropriate response. Sustaining a framework of mutual respect and correspondence in spite of our deepest preference conflicts is especially vital for our society today, within and beyond the college campus.
Again, this is not to say that there is never a correct answer. In fact, there are debates in metaethics concerning whether or not morality takes a precise form — whether morality is relative, a social construct, or absolutely true. Regardless of whether there is an answer that clearly settles the matter, we should be open to new perspectives, potentialities, and possibilities. For what is an Oreo if it’s not wonderfilled?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard classes switch online and students leave Cambridge in response to the coronavirus, a growing number of undergraduates have called on the University to modify its grading requirements.
The College currently permits students to take certain courses on a pass-fail basis. Last week, Harvard extended the deadline for students to switch their courses to pass-fail grading to April 13.
While individual departments have announced they will now also allow courses taken pass-fail to count for concentration credit, some students said an opt-in pass-fail policy is insufficiently equitable.
Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20 argued that the College should adopt a “universal pass” system where all students would pass all their courses this semester. Yale University students first proposed this model through a petition called “No Fail Yale.”
“Given the variety of conditions that students are facing right now at home — whether that’s limited internet access, or having to find a way to make money for the families, or the stress that having another individual in the household brings — it is my belief, and I think the belief in a lot of people in first-gen community, that there should be a different kind of grading accommodation for students during the semester,” Sorkin said.
Sorkin said he believes that, under an opt-in pass-fail system, students whose home environments are hospitable would be able to take courses for a letter grade and boost their GPAs. By contrast, he said their less privileged peers will be more likely to take courses on a pass-fail basis and will miss out on the GPA-boosting opportunity.
Abigail “Abby” R. Lockhart-Calpito ’23, who said she is a first-gen, low-income student, agreed. In response to the change in course format, she drafted and distributed an email template aimed at encouraging professors to champion the universal pass system.
“I believe that applying it to everyone just levels out the playing field completely,” Lockhart-Calpito said. “Students, especially first-gen, low-income students shouldn’t have to decide between their education and taking care of their family.”
Other undergraduates have proposed a second model — a “Double A” system, under which students would receive either an A or an A-minus for their courses this semester.
A new student group — Harvard for All — began circulating a petition in favor of the Double A model Wednesday afternoon, which quickly garnered over 500 signatures.
Carrington McDowell-Walsh ’20 said she supports the Double A system because she believes it ensures educational equity while still providing letter grades to students who require graded courses for scholarship eligibility, graduate school applications, and professional certifications.
“The issue with [universal pass] is that for kids who are pre-med, they need grades for certain classes and people who are going to grad school also need grades for certain classes so it doesn’t make sense entirely to do full pass,” she said. “It also goes for kids on scholarships because they sometimes need to maintain a certain GPA.”
Denisse Cordova Carrizales ’22 also said she favors Double A over universal pass. She said first-gen, low-income students rely on grades to show how they have improved academically over the course of their time at Harvard.
“I think that the first-gen and low-income community had a hard time adjusting to Harvard their freshman year or their first semester, and a lot of these students still want to attend a competitive graduate school or a professional school,” Carrizales said. “A pass-fail system wouldn’t impact a student’s GPA positively or negatively, and so some students wouldn’t be able to show off their improvement.”
Lockhart-Calpito said students should not have to worry about how losing grades will impact their future. If the College adopts a universal pass system, she said, graduate programs should respond by reading students’ transcripts with the radical changes brought on by the pandemic in mind.
“These competitive graduate programs and professional schools and summer programs are just going to have to change the way they think about student GPAs, especially at this very critical time,” she said.
Whichever new system — if any — the College adopts, Walsh said Harvard must “equalize” the differences in students’ resources and living situations, which she said recent upheavals have thrown into relief.
“When you’re on campus, we all have the same resources,” Walsh said. “But when you put us all in different places, Harvard needs to make sure that the grades that end up at the end of semester don’t just show differences in income and background.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty percent of surveyed Central Square businesses will not survive another eight weeks under the current economic strain brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent study.
The District Impact Study, released by the Central Square Business Improvement District on Sunday, aimed to quantify the “damage to-date” wrought by the virus. Fifty-one CSBID member businesses and organizations participated in the survey.
The businesses reported varying degrees of economic impact: sales losses, staffing issues, layoffs, cancellations, investments to accommodate new safety protocols, and even closed doors.
The pain was nearly universal among respondents; 96 percent said they have felt the effects of COVID-19 on their establishment.
In the report, owners shared serious business woes. Jonathan Mendez, co-founder of the Saloniki Greek chain, which has a location in Harvard Square, called the virus’s impact “paralyzing” in the report.
“It’s not a snowstorm, it’s not some event that can be ‘stopped,’ we don’t know when it will be over,” he said in the report.
The survey found that 72 percent of respondents are waiting on further directions from local and state governments on whether to remain open.
On Sunday, Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all dine-in restaurants to close for a month, but some Central Square businesses closed before then amid COVID-19 fears.
Adam J. Penn, co-owner of Veggie Galaxy — which suspended operations prior to Baker’s announcement — said in an interview that the idea of remaining open “made us very uncomfortable.”
“We’d rather be a part of the solution,” Penn said. “So we made the call early. It was hard.”
In the report, CSBID Executive Director Michael Monestime urged the closure of all non-essential businesses and called for immediate financial aid from the city government. He also made a series of “emergency relief recommendations,” including establishing a relief fund for businesses, waiving meals and sales taxes, and protecting local tenants from eviction.
The report also includes numerous public health recommendations, such as providing hygiene packs to the homeless and creating public hand-washing stations.
Some stores that rely on public gatherings for large sales boosts have taken a particularly big hit. Heartbreak Hill Running Company, which expected to see a bump from the Boston Marathon, could lose “$200,000 to $300,000” as a result of the pandemic, according to owner Justin Burdon.
The Boston Athletic Association recently rescheduled the annual event for September.
Steve Adelson, owner of Teddy Shoes — a family-run store specializing in dance wear that has operated in Central Square for 63 years — shared similar sentiments in the report.
“The dropoff is alarming,” Adelson said in the report. “We can’t stay in business if no one comes in.”
Other business owners said they had initially attempted to continue operating under social distancing guidelines, but eventually had no choice but to shut down indefinitely.
Dennis J. Silva, general manager of Miracle of Science Bar and Grill, detailed new safety measures the restaurant had implemented in a Wednesday interview, including increased sterilization efforts and the removal of salt and pepper shakers from tables. But even with these measures, Miracle of Science since closed its doors indefinitely.
Other Cambridge neighborhoods are also feeling the effects of the pandemic. The Porter Square Neighbors Association postponed its Thursday meeting this week over outbreak concerns; the Kendall Square Association announced that all of its events will move online.
Despite the gloomy prospects for many businesses, some respondents to the CSBID survey remained hopeful about possible governmental relief. As of Wednesday evening, Congress and the White House continue to negotiate possible stimulus funds for individuals and small businesses.
“All indications are that there will be some sort of government intervention,” Penn said. “We're anxiously waiting to see what that will be.”
“It’s really going to be up to the community,” Silva said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The novel coronavirus pandemic has nearly emptied Harvard’s campus, sending students and faculty home for the remainder of the semester. It has also plunged the world into what Rutgers Business School professor John Longo called “the most serious financial crisis since the Great Recession and perhaps the Great Depression.”
“Huge swaths of the economy have been shut down with no clear sign that the bottom is near,” Longo wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Financial markets are in a state of panic, despite attempts by the Federal Reserve and the federal government to stem the decline.”
Experts like Longo say that the impact of coronavirus on the global financial sector presents risks to the University — namely, through its endowment.
Harvard retains most of its wealth in the endowment, which totalled $40.9 billion in June 2019. It’s also the single largest source of revenue supporting the University, comprising 35 percent of its operating budget.
Darrell Duffie, a professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, said Harvard’s endowment will likely shrink due to the volatility in the market.
“Financial markets are reflecting a very big macroeconomic shock,” Duffie said. “What was 40 billion is going to be a lot less by the time the devaluations are marked into it.”
Patrick S. McKiernan — a spokesperson for Harvard Management Company, which manages the endowment — wrote in an emailed statement that while they are monitoring the situation, HMC is focused on its long-term financial stability.
“While we always seek to mitigate the effects of market downturns on our portfolio — and capitalize on them when we can — the ten-year and twenty-year investment returns are where our sights remain focused to ensure the endowment can support the University’s mission in perpetuity,” McKiernan wrote.
The University's endowment is allocated into different asset classes — each of which will reflect the shock differently. For example, 26 percent of the endowment is in public equities, the prices of which are already down about 25 percent, according to Duffie. Based on those figures, Duffie estimated that the endowment has already lost “at least 6 percent of market value” in public equities alone.
Longo estimated that the portion of the endowment invested in public equities has “very likely taken a double digit hit.”
Another 20 percent of the endowment is in private equity, and 33 percent is in hedge funds, per the University’s 2019 financial report.
Duffie said that the performance of private equity funds and hedge funds under current conditions will vary.
“Some will do well, some will do very badly,” he said.
Overall, though, he said he expects losses.
“I assume they’re going to be down, perhaps substantially, because hedge funds tend to take more risk than the kinds of risks we see in public equity markets,” he said.
Longo predicted that hedge funds could help cushion the blow from private equities.
“Hedge funds are a broad asset class, but it is conceivable that Harvard’s market neutral and long/short hedge funds actually delivered positive returns,” Longo wrote in an emailed statement. “If this is the case, it would materially soften the blow from the sharp drop in equities from around the world.”
As for private equity funds, Longo wrote that, because they tend to be valued with a lag, it “may take a while to get a true picture of the endowment’s performance during the current bear market.”
In the aftermath of the Great Recession in 2009, the total value of the endowment declined almost 30 percent — equal to $11 billion of the then-$37 billion endowment.
Timothy J. Keating ’85, the president of Keating Wealth Management, wrote that the current situation is “directly comparable” to that period, with regard to short-term investment returns. After the 2009 crash, the endowment’s invested assets took a 27.3 percent hit.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, wrote in an emailed statement that the University’s financial situation is “grave.”
“Along with most of its peers, Harvard has huge fixed costs which can’t be easily shed or diminished,” Parker wrote. “Tenure limits its ability to downsize faculty; Harvard has enormous pension and retirement health benefit obligations. It’s impossible to imagine a scenario in which the endowment, especially in its diminished state, can spare Harvard from major reductions in operating costs.”
Parker wrote that that situation could pose major challenges for the University.
“Spending down an already drastically diminished endowment in order to avoid reducing operating expenses could be the beginning of a death spiral in which endowment shrinkage multiplies,” Parker wrote.
Keating also theorized that the crisis could impact another source of the University’s revenue — the amount of donations it brings in.
“I suspect the most immediate impact will be on alumni giving,” he wrote.
Duffie agreed that there’s a chance donations could drop, since “the people that give gifts to Harvard may themselves be affected,” he said.
“On the other hand, people that give gifts that are in a good financial position may see that Harvard could benefit, especially now, from additional donations, so they might be even more forthcoming than normal,” Duffie added.
In response to concerns about the revenue streams of colleges and universities across the country, Moody’s Investors Service — a credit rating agency — flipped its rating on the financial outlook of the higher education sector from “stable” to “negative” on Wednesday.
“Universities face unprecedented enrollment uncertainty, risks to multiple revenue streams and potential material erosion in their balance sheets,” the report from Moody’s read.
Still, both Duffie and Parker said that Harvard is relatively well-situated for the crisis.
“The University as a whole has an excellent reputation, that has lots of resources beyond its endowment, including new fundraising and new development fundraising, so Harvard is in a very strong position,” Duffie said.
Parker credited University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who is an economist by training, for working to prepare the University for the next recession since he took office in 2018.
“Larry Bacow deserves credit for flagging ‘recession planning’ as a priority two years ago well before most of his colleagues,” Parker wrote. “This should enable the administration to better execute the difficult reductions in expenses which are now inevitable.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton said that the current state of affairs evidences why Harvard engages in such planning.
“This is a rapidly evolving situation that illustrates why we practice contingency planning as a precaution,” Newton wrote in an emailed statement. “The University will continue to leverage its contingency planning to inform and help guide our decisions for the future.”
Duffie also emphasized that the long-term financial consequences of coronavirus remain uncertain.
“We’re still in the early stages of this. We don’t know much and people shouldn’t jump to conclusions,” Duffie said. “We’re in a period of high uncertainty, so it’s going to take a little while before we get a better sense of what are the true market values, and how different investors are going to come out of this.”
Much of the future depends on how the market responds to the changing circumstances in the coming weeks and months.
“The impact of market declines on Harvard’s expenditures are unclear at this time. If weakness persists, then it is likely that there will be cuts to planned expenditures,” Longo wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent months, a new campus organization, Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, called on Harvard to divest from companies tied to the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
When it comes to divesting its $40.9 billion endowment, that call marks only the latest in a series of demands activists have made of the University, including divesting from fossil fuels, the prison industry, and Puerto Rican debt. 
At a Junior Family Weekend event, activists hoisted a “Justice for Palestine” banner in front of University President Lawrence S. Bacow. The recent movement boasts prominent backers, like African and African American Studies Professor Cornel R. West ’74, who said Harvard “should disinvest in terms of its complicity with the Israeli occupation of Palestine” in February. In its 2019 report, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign named four companies in which Harvard indirectly invests that it said were linked to the Israeli military. Those investments amount to $86,625.
For the most part, though, the University’s financial involvement in the conflict has remained unclear.
The Crimson’s analysis of the Harvard Management Company’s latest filings found that HMC had over $194 million directly invested in Booking Holdings, a company that a United Nations human rights body ties to Israeli settlements in Palestine.
Booking Holdings — the parent company of a number of travel-related businesses, including Booking.com, Kayak, and OpenTable — is one of just nine companies in which Harvard has direct public investments.
In 2018, Human Rights Watch found that Booking.com and other services that connect travellers to accommodations — like Airbnb — list rental properties in the Palestinian territories.
Omar Shakir — the Israel and Palestine Director for Human Rights Watch — said he thinks the settlements are “at the root” of human rights abuses, criticizing Booking's decision to list properties in them.
“They basically broker rentals on land stolen from Palestinians who themselves can’t stay in those listings,” Shakir said. “Booking — by brokering these rentals in West Bank settlements — is helping to entrench the settlement enterprise.”
Shakir added that he believes the rentals listed on Booking.com — which are not available to Palestinians — are “benefiting from the infrastructure, the water, [and] the electricity” in the region.
Booking Holdings did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Harvard also holds $294,988 in indirect investments through Exchange Traded Funds in other companies on the list that the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights released in February. Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, are exchange-traded securities that often contain small investments in hundreds to thousands of other companies that meet certain criteria.
The list from the U.N. includes 112 business entities, 20 of which — including Booking Holdings, Expedia, General Mills, and Motorola — fall within the ETFs Harvard is invested in.
Kelsey Roemhildt, a spokesperson for General Mills, wrote in an emailed statement that the company is included in the United Nations list because it holds a factory in the Atarot Industrial Park in East Jerusalem, which uses natural resources like land and water.
“General Mills stations personnel at the facility to monitor product quality and we regularly monitor to ensure safe working conditions, adequate work and rest areas, and compliance with labor and human rights laws,” Roemhildt wrote.
She also wrote that roughly 50 percent of the workers at the factory are Palestinian, and that they work “alongside” Israelis in addition to receiving “full social benefits without prejudice to race, religion or nationality.”
Shakir, however, said he believes that all businesses that operate in the area are “complicit” in human rights violations since its Israeli and Palestinian workers are governed by a “two tiered labor system.”
“The Israelis are governed under Israeli civil law and the Palestinian under military law, so that applies to things like wages, minimum wage, labor protections,” Shakir said. “Companies have a role to play in terms of entrenching the settlement enterprises, and what Human Rights Watch has found over the years of research is that businesses that operate in settlements are invariably contributing to and benefiting from serious abuses of human rights.”
Expedia and Motorola did not respond to request for comment.
A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Israel noted that Israel “condemns” the list of companies from the United Nations.
“Israel condemns the publication of this discriminatory list, which unfairly singles out Israel, provides support for the anti-Israel Boycott Divest Sanction (BDS) movement, and lacks fundamental requirements of due process,” the statement read. “No other disputed region of the world has been subject to a similar type of attempted sanction.”
Sarah H. Gold, a volunteer with the Palestine Advocacy Project and a student at Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said she believes the investment in Booking Holdings amounts to “profiting off war crimes.”
“Harvard is a world renowned institution. What it does matters. People are watching. People look to it. And what it’s doing right now is profiting off of war crimes,” Gold said.
Hind Awwad — a member of the steering committee of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel — wrote in a statement that the organization is “troubled” by Harvard’s investments in Booking.
“We’re particularly troubled that Harvard is investing in Booking Holdings, owner of Booking.com, a company that profits from stolen Palestinian homes and lands,” Awwad wrote. “We urge the administration to divest from this, and all, companies on the UN List.”
Gold said she also hopes Harvard Management Company will reevaluate its investment in Booking and in other companies on the list. In total, the direct and indirect investments amount to nearly $200 million.
“Is Harvard an irresponsible institution that does not consider where its money goes? I don’t think so,” she said. “There are plenty of other investment options that do not necessitate complicity and oppression. And the question is, is Harvard going to be a principled institution or not.”
Patrick S. McKiernan — a spokesperson for Harvard Management Company — wrote in an email that HMC takes “environmental, social, and governance factors (ESG) factors that may impact the performance of our investment” into account in its investment decisions.
“HMC strongly believes that considering all data is not only in line with our fiduciary duty, but simply something that thoughtful investors do,” McKiernan wrote.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also claimed the list is “not based on any acceptable legal or quasi-legal process,” and therefore encouraged companies not to boycott the companies on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Sciences Christopher W. Stubbs reiterated the University’s current remote-work policy in a Wednesday email to divisional chairs and leaders after a graduate student complained they had been coerced to report in person for work at a lab.
In an announcement last week, Stubbs and other administrators mandated all research laboratories affiliated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences “ramp-down” non-essential activity by March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“To minimize community interactions, we ask that each lab identify at most 2-3 key individuals, in discussion with the department chair, to manage issues such as animal husbandry or essential experiments—those that if discontinued would generate significant financial and data loss,” the administrators wrote.
On Tuesday, Stubbs forwarded a message he received from an unnamed source to divisional chairs and leaders. In the email, the source claimed a graduate student had come to them with concerns that their lab was coercing its students to come in after March 18 — the final day for laboratories to suspend regular operations.
“I had a graduate student ( I will not name) who works in an experimentalist lab (I will not name) that is coercing their students to still come in after tomorrow. Could someone tell faculty that NO ONE is allowed to come in,” the email read. “Because the person I talked to was worried and it sounds like some of their other lab mates were worried as well.”
Stubbs followed the forwarded message with a request that chairs broadcast the remote-work policy to “one and all.”
“Everyone is working remotely. Period,” he wrote.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Stubbs wrote that it is crucial scientists follow the recent measures against in-person laboratory activity.
“We are taking a very aggressive stance on social distancing and reducing personnel on campus to essential individuals and those students who were, for a variety of reasons, not able to depart,” Stubbs wrote. “We expect all members of our community to abide by this policy, and any pressure to do otherwise is unacceptable.”
Stubbs added that the graduate student’s concerns were addressed swiftly and positively by the Sciences administration. He encouraged other members of the Sciences to direct similar complaints to supervisors.
“I view this exchange as the system working in our favor- the graduate student reached out to a trusted individual, who brought this to my attention, which in turn prompted immediate action,” Stubbs wrote. “I urge anyone in our community who is aware of actions that are inconsistent with our policies to bring that to a supervisor or Division of Science leader so we can rapidly take corrective action.”
“We take our social responsibility very seriously, and urge everyone to make prudent decisions in the time ahead,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has identified four University affiliates who have tested positive for COVID-19, though several undergraduates reported in interviews that, despite experiencing symptoms of the disease, they have been unable to get results amid a nationwide test shortage.
The four positive and “presumptive positive” cases include those tested by Harvard University Health Services as well as people who self-reported their test results, according to an HUHS website last updated Wednesday.
One Harvard undergraduate, who requested anonymity out of privacy concerns, said she went to a hospital near her home on Sunday with symptoms including a cough, shortness of breath, headaches, and fatigue. A doctor told her she likely had COVID-19, but said her symptoms were not severe enough to merit admission to the hospital and testing, according to the student. The student also said the doctor prescribed an inhaler for her asthma and sent her home to self-isolate for 14 days.
HUHS has advised Harvard affiliates to report if they have been tested for COVID-19. Still, COVID-19 tests are in short supply in much of the United States, and as a result many patients experiencing symptoms go without an official diagnosis.
The student, who did not receive a test, texted her resident tutor Monday morning to inform them of the situation. She said she was uncertain if the tutor or other Harvard officials took further action. The tutor did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that HUHS does not comment on individual cases, but the University shapes its policies regarding coronavirus using public health guidelines.
“HUHS addresses each case based on the unique characteristics of the situation at hand,” he wrote. “HUHS’s decisions and recommendations are based upon the latest guidance of the CDC, as well as state and local departments of public health. External guidance changes rapidly in response to the science and the available resources in this public health emergency, so the advice from HUHS may also evolve over time.”
Another Harvard College student, who also requested anonymity out of privacy concerns, said she went to HUHS three times last week with a fever and soreness. That student, who said she tested negative for the flu, said no one she saw at HUHS raised coronavirus as a concern.
On her third visit to HUHS, the student said a doctor advised her to go to Mount Auburn Hospital for further testing. Upon arrival, the student said doctors immediately isolated her out of concern she might have had COVID-19.
The student criticized HUHS for prompting her to pay for a ride to the hospital and for a $100 copay for the visit to the emergency room. She said HUHS contacted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health asking if she qualified for a COVID-19 test but did not update her on her status.
The student also said HUHS did not give her clear advice regarding whether she should quarantine on campus or board her scheduled flight. She said she has not received a COVID-19 test as of Wednesday.
The rising number of cases at Harvard comes as states including Massachusetts, which now has at least 218 recorded cases of COVID-19, take drastic steps to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The state closed public schools through April 6 , limited gatherings to 25 people, and prohibited on-premises consumption of food or drink at bars and restaurants through April 6.
As of Wednesday evening, at least 8,260 cases of COVID-19 and 147 deaths were reported in the U.S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard released guidance on how the coronavirus will affect University health plans, students said they remain uncertain about costs and complications associated with the new policies.
The University’s Student Health Insurance Plan will front all costs associated with COVID-19 tests and consultations that members receive at medical providers affiliated with Blue Cross Blue Shield, the health insurance company Harvard uses, according to a health insurance primer published on the University’s Health Program website last week.
The plan will also lift the preexisting six-visit limit cap on medically necessary visits outside of Harvard University Health Services and the 40-visit limit cap on mental health visits through July 31, 2020. HUHS also unveiled a temporary medical hardship fund that will reimburse selected students from $500 to $1,200 for out-of-pocket costs, not including pharmacy tabs.
Although the majority of students have left Cambridge, HUHS will remain open for urgent care from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week, while other services will operate remotely. Students can also consult with a trained medical professional through a remote healthcare app, and appointments through Counseling and Mental Health Services and Behavioral Health will take place via phone.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that “HUHS is singularly focused on helping ensure the safety and wellbeing of every member of the Harvard community.”
“In line with that, and the University’s efforts to decrease the number of individuals on campus, HUHS has taken steps to temporarily enhance and adapt the terms of the [Student Health Insurance Plan] to ensure plan members are able to continue to access the health services they need, wherever they are located geographically at this time,” Newton wrote.
For all other medical services, standing copayment rates apply. They will vary, however, based on whether the medical provider is “in-system” — meaning that it is affiliated with Blue Cross Blue Shield — or it is “out-of-system” — providers which tend to charge higher rates. The Harvard website states members can search for in-network medical providers through a Blue Cross Blue Shield database online, and also advised members to “familiarize yourself with plan benefits before needing care.”
Harvard Ph.D. student Max G. Ehrenfreund said he believes the modifications Harvard made to its health care plan are necessary. Still, he said the University’s Health Program website is “vague” and does not clearly state how much members will have to pay for services. As a result, he said some Harvard families may incur significant medical costs because of the logistical complications finding in-system providers presents.
“If you’re traveling, you have to make a plan for where you’ll go if you get sick,” Ehrenfreund said. “I don’t think many undergraduates are going to do this. And as a result, some of them or at least their parents are going to be paying potentially really big medical bills.”
Ph.D. student Carleigh A. Beriont, who was traveling home to Hampton, N.H. on Tuesday, wrote in a text that she is concerned about the costs she will owe if she or her daughter — who is a dependent on her plan — need medical attention. She wrote that the closest in-network medical provider is 100 miles away.
“Mostly I’m worried about what might happen if one of us gets sick. She’s out of daycare now—so I’m not as worried about her getting sick in the immediate future. Just not sure what we’ll do if she gets sick,” Beriont wrote.
Some students said they appreciated HUHS offering medical advice remotely.
Peyton S. Williams ’23 said she appreciates the efforts HUHS has taken to help students get medical care as the healthcare system remains in flux. She said she is confident HUHS will continue to provide her medical advice even though she no longer lives in Cambridge.
“I think it’s good that they’re letting us contact them so that they can answer our questions and provide care over the phone, and they can still order us tests, come up with referrals,” she said. “I think they’re doing the best they can.”
Nicole M. Daurio ’20 said she will likely not personally benefit from medical attention over the phone. She said she has stopped using CAMHS’s services because therapy sessions via phone calls do not meet her personal needs. As a result, she said she will pay hundreds of dollars per 50 minute session.
“Online is great for a lot of people. It does not fit my needs. So I then canceled my three upcoming appointments,” she said.
Ehrenfreund, who previously reported on the Affordable Care Act for The Washington Post, said he thinks the FAQ fails to address several important questions about the state of student health plans.
He said that while he found several in-network hospitals near his home in Portland, Ore., he does not know to what degree insurance will foot the bill.
“I found three hospitals in Portland that are in-network, which is great news. But there’s a catch, which is that hospital cost choice sharing means that even for in-network hospitals, the hospital still determines the level of insurance for different services,” he said. “So even now, I still don’t know how much I’ll be paying if I have to go to one of those hospitals. I know that they’re insured, but I don’t know to what degree.”
Ehrenfreund also said that though he was happy to see HUHS remove the cap on appointments and mental health visits, it is unclear what costs, if any, members will have to pay for those additional visits.
“If they can make clear that reimbursement will not be required — that these costs will be covered in the clinic or at the hospital — that would be a real relief for a lot of people,” he added.
Newton wrote in his email that the healthcare system more broadly is changing rapidly to meet the public’s needs. Harvard members should regularly check Harvard’s website to learn of new coverage policies, he added.
“The current public health crisis is a rapidly evolving situation, with new guidance and regulations being issued on a near daily basis. With that, HUHS encourages SHIP members to continue to monitor the FAQs it has posted online for updates to the plan,” he wrote.
CLARIFICATION: March 19, 2020
A previous version of the Harvard University Health Services FAQ referenced in this article stated that urgent care services will remain open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The page has since been updated to reflect the correct hours — 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will provide 30 days of paid leave with benefits to employees whose work cannot continue remotely during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, such as dining hall staff and custodians whose facilities have closed.
The “emergency paid time off” benefit applies to those staff who are healthy and able to work, but whose jobs cannot occur remotely and there are no alternate work assignments available, according to a dedicated coronavirus page on Harvard’s Human Resources website. Employees who are sick, self-isolated, quarantined, or taking care of a family member due to COVID-19 may use sick time, including up to 14 unearned days as a loan.
Last week, the University transitioned all classes online and asked undergraduates not to return to campus in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, resulting in numerous closures, from research labs to dining halls.
UNITE HERE Local 26 President-elect Carlos Aramayo, whose union represents Harvard dining hall workers, said he is “happy” with the 30-day paid leave policy, which will kick in next Monday for Harvard University Dining Services staff whose dining halls have closed.
Only the Eliot, Kirkland, Lowell, Quincy, and Adams House dining halls will remain open to serve the few undergraduates who were allowed to remain on campus. Cabot and Pforzheimer dining facilities will also remain open to serve graduate students, according to Local 26 chief shop stewards Laquiesha N. Rainey and Aaron J. Duckett. The halls will serve exclusively bagged meals — with three options each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner — to comply with new Massachusetts rules prohibiting on-site food and beverage consumption.
These dining halls employ fewer than 25 people normally, according to Rainey, meaning they comply with University policy prohibiting non-essential gatherings of more than 25 individuals.
Aramayo added that the union’s initial agreement with Harvard met Local 26’s top priorities, which were to maintain healthcare benefits for members during the crisis and to prepare them for the “income hit that’s coming.” Local 26 employees at Harvard receive year-round health benefits, despite only working during the school year, meaning the University will continue to provide benefits despite the closures.
Rainey said Harvard has also agreed to continue making regular contributions to employees’ benefits during the 30-day paid leave period. Employees whose dining halls remain open may take sick leave according to the new, more flexible sick time policy.
“This health crisis kind of came at us rather quickly,” Rainey said. “Harvard and the union were real quick to come together and try to meet in the middle and make sure that the members and the students were taken care of in this situation, and keep everybody safe as best as possible.”
32BJ Service Employees International Union Vice President Roxana Rivera wrote in an emailed statement that no custodians have been laid off or seen reduced hours due to the outbreak thus far.
“While some buildings on campus have closed, we’ve been able to work with the University to move workers to other buildings rather than reducing staff,” Rivera wrote.
“These are difficult and scary times for all, and we’re doing everything within our power to ensure that Harvard workers are able to support themselves and their families while having access to the resources they need,” she wrote. “We are in daily contact with Harvard management, along with their contractors, to ensure that workers have the supplies they need to do their jobs safely, and can stay on the job despite university life being shut down.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that any custodians put out of work by building closures will receive 30 days of paid leave with benefits.
Aramayo said that discussions are still underway about whether the 30-day paid leave policy will extend to subcontracted employees also represented by Local 26. Food service workers at Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Graduate School of Design are employed by Restaurant Associates — a national dining services firm — rather than directly by the University.
“It’s not been resolved as of yet, but we’re hopeful we’ll get to a good resolution on that,” Aramayo said.
A Restaurant Associates spokesperson declined to comment on applying the 30-day paid leave policy to Restaurant Associates employees, referring to Harvard. Newton, the University spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that the University’s initial priority is to its direct hire employees, adding that Harvard will continue to review its policies.
Employees whose facilities have closed will still face a gap between the end of paid leave and the scheduled end of the school year in which they could go unpaid — an issue Aramayo said Local 26 continues to discuss with the University.
“This is a very fast moving and very fluid situation,” Aramayo said. “Just because we’ve gotten this initial agreement to have this 30-day period, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to stop talking to the University.”
Duckett said that, even as the pandemic has continued to unfold, HUDS workers have continued to report to work out of care for the students.
“We love the students, and we’re really worried about the students,” Duckett said. “That’s always been our job and always something we’ve been proud of.”
