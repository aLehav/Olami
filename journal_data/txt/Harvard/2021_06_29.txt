After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of my first semester at Harvard, I wrote my final essay for my freshman seminar on being queer. Well, more accurately, I was writing about Sappho and classicists’ icky history of removing the gay from Sappho and portraying her as just a gal with her pals in order to keep her work in the classical Greco-Roman canon, but those are kinda the same thing.
I’ve never been queerer in my life than I’ve been at Harvard. I come from a suburb in the Bay Area of California, which is the kind of place you’d think would be liberal as could be, because duh! California. But I wouldn’t be surprised if half the parents in our school district voted for Trump. We didn’t talk about queer people, except when glossed over as fast as possible or as the butt of a joke about toxic masculinity. I didn’t tell anyone I was queer in high school. I didn’t even tell my closest friends when I started dating a member of our friend group at the conclusion of senior year.
Then I came to Harvard, where I could say the words “girlfriend” and “any pronouns” and “queer” and no one would bat an eye. No pause, no awkward giggle, no immediate attempt to divert the conversation. People looked me in the eyes and accepted me.
They did more than silently accept me — they were bold in their allyship and solidarity. My Computer Science professor called my (now ex-) girlfriend my “hot French girlfriend.” One of my housemates last semester asked me with genuine care in his voice how to address people before learning their pronouns and how to ask for pronouns respectfully. When filling out an application to be a teaching fellow for a class, I made a passing comment about figuring out “how to subtly slip in the fact that I am gay,” to which one of my friends responded, “why do you need to be subtle?”
The tension between subtlety and outness is, of course, a cornerstone of the queer experience. Being vocally, unabashedly, look-at-me-once-and-it’s-so-obvious queer is important to me. (Once a girl at a party asked me if I was, verbatim, “not straight,” and I rode that elation for a solid week afterward). It’s my way of saying I am here and I have gone through so much strife, internal and external, to be here and so conspicuously queer in front of you, and I’ll do it again. But it’s not how I am everywhere. It’s definitely not how I am in my sleepy hometown. The volume of my queerness is directly proportional to how comfortable and safe I feel in a space. And I’ve never felt safer in my queer identity than at college.
Unfortunately, especially in the month of Pride, seeing those beautiful rainbow and leather-filled Pride Parades, homophobic people who don’t like to be called homophobic love to say, “I don’t find anything wrong with queer people! I just don’t like how they have to shove their sexuality and gender in my face all the time.”
How dare you.
Queer people blossom into their identities when they are put in caring, accepting environments. I know so many people from my hometown who switched high schools or left for college and came out as queer not long after. “Baby gays,” as they are fondly referred to within the queer community, burst into color-coded streamers when they find the words and communities to describe themselves as. They talk a mile a minute about gender and sexuality for all the years they couldn’t. Who are you to deny the power of expression to people who have spent their lives up to this point hiding?
There is so much joy in being loudly, freely queer. My friend from home sculpting the Venus de Milo with male genitalia at the pinnacle of her trans self-actualization journey. The bisexual triumvirate of my house last semester getting drunk and passionately advocating for WLW relationships. Completely painting the face of my dear friend who I lovingly refer to as “the most lesbian lesbian to ever exist” with giant rainbow stripes for the San Francisco Pride Parade that never happened. I have so much pride in my queer community. Every time I think of all the beautiful, strong, amazing queer people I know, and the community at large, it all comes flying out of me, over and over again: I’m queer. I’m queer. I’m so queer and I love it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Tuesday, June 29 at 7:03 p.m.
Harvard University and MIT will sell edX — a virtual learning initiative launched jointly by the two schools in 2012 to expand education access — to the Maryland-based tech startup 2U, Inc., the schools announced Tuesday morning.
Subject to regulatory and governmental approval, the schools will receive $800 million in cash for the acquisition, which they announced would go towards a non-profit aimed at advancing inclusion in education and closing learning gaps.
In the nine years since its creation, edX has grown to offer 3,300 courses with more than 160 partner universities. But a large portion of its more than 39 million learners worldwide are college-educated individuals aiming to continue their learning.
Through investments in new technology and marketing, 2U will be equipped to reach more diverse learners and compete with for-profit platforms while continuing the mission of edX, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote to Harvard affiliates in an email announcing the acquisition Tuesday.
“The agreement with 2U ensures the sustainability of the edX mission—including continued access to low-cost and free courses—through capital investments at the level required to reach learners globally with a wide range of courses across multiple disciplines and fields,” the administrators wrote.
2U, which was founded in 2008 and went public in 2014, offers online courses and degree programs through partnerships with other universities. The acquisition of edX will increase the number of online offerings the service provides from 500 to well over 3,000.
“2U and edX were founded on a shared vision that online education has the power to expand access, create opportunity, and transform lives,” the company’s co-founder, Christopher “Chip” Paucek, said in a press release announcing the acquisition.
Anant Agarwal, the founder and CEO of edX, said at a press briefing Tuesday that the growth in users that the initiative saw during the pandemic prompted it to begin looking for strategic partnerships last fall.
“We knew that we had an opportunity to take the whole mission to the next level,” he said.
He said edX “looked at a number of alternatives,” including staying independent as a nonprofit. All edX employees will stay on in similar roles under 2U, he added.
Garber said at the news briefing that “it was essential for us to engage in a systematic process to look at a variety of alternatives.”
“This was all about how best to advance the mission, and the connection with 2U seemed to us to be exactly the right way to go,” he said.
The nonprofit Harvard and MIT will create with the proceeds from selling edX will aim to tackle inequities in education by increasing the impact of online learning, especially within under-resourced and historically disadvantaged populations. It also plans to focus on developing partnerships with educational organizations, including other universities and community colleges, that work directly with disadvantaged learners.
“Increasing access and operating at scale certainly brought more people to the table, but those people most in need of opportunities remain underserved, a situation exacerbated and underscored by the pandemic,” Bacow and Garber wrote. “If we hope to make progress toward addressing longstanding educational inequities, we have to invest our time and resources in those areas where we believe we can have outsized impact.”
Harvard Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Bharat N. Anand ’88 told the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication — another goal of the nonprofit will be to advance the development of online platforms to provide more accessible and immersive learning experiences.
“The nonprofit will support research to learn more about the barriers that disadvantaged communities face in being able to take full advantage of online learning platforms, such as language barriers, bandwidth, and cultural biases in design, and develop actionable strategies to address them,” he said.
Building off of the online education approaches taken by edX, Bacow and Garber wrote that Harvard and MIT hope the nonprofit will be able to “support people at all stages of education” through innovations in learning.
“It is impossible to predict the kinds of impact that reimagining and reorienting our work will have, but it is inspiring to think about what it will mean to meet individuals where they are and to instill in them not just skills for the future but also a love of learning,” Bacow and Garber wrote.
