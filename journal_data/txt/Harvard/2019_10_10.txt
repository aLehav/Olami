After taking a break from Boston for almost 10 years, “Giselle” returns to the city with pomp at the Citizens Bank Opera House this fall. The opening of Boston Ballet’s 2019-2020 season featured the traditional choreography of Jean Coralli, Jules Perrot and Marius Petipa. This particular performance was adapted by the formidable Larissa Ponomarenko, a former principal dancer at the company and one of its current ballet masters. Ponomarenko first played the eponymous role first in 1994, and made it her own with her majestic interpretation. For this reason, Boston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen solely entrusted her to stage this Gothic tale — and she more than delivered. Ponomarenko crafted a traditional and resplendent performance that married both excellent leading performances with gorgeous set design.
“Giselle” takes place in a small village in Germany’s Rhine Valley during medieval times. This quaint village is home to the namesake protagonist (Viktorina Kapitonova),who lives with her mother, Berthe (Elizabethe Olds). Though a beautiful dancer, Giselle’s weak heart makes her hobby quite a dangerous one. With the arrival of the village wine festival comes Count Albrecht of Silesia (Patrick Yocum), who masquerades as a peasant farmer named Loys. He courts Giselle and they fall in love with each other, much to the chagrin of jealous gamekeeper Hilarion (Paul Craig), who is also in love with Giselle. The arrival of a courtly hunting party, led by the Duke of Courland (Desean Taber) and his daughter Bathilde (Lauren Flower), brings utter disaster as Bathilde is engaged to Albrecht. Upon learning the truth about Albrecht, Giselle goes mad and dies from her weak heart. The second act sees both Hilarion and Albrecht grieving at Giselle’s grave when they are attacked by nocturnal spirits, the Wilis, led by their queen Myrtha (Dawn Atkins): The men are cursed by these ghostly spirits and forced to dance to their deaths. Though Giselle’s spirit initially prepares to join the other’s ranks, she returns to earth when she sacrifices her aspirations to save Albrecht’s life.
Kapitonova delivered a luscious and sensitive performance as Giselle. She danced with ease and a delicacy as she leaped across the stage with epic grand jetés in the faster moments and also sustained deep arabesques into penchées during slower parts. Overall, she brought an intense precision with her model technique that did not falter across the two acts. Kapitonova coupled her technique with an expressive take on the melodramatics of the classic ballet. More so than most ballets, “Giselle” requires quite a bit of pantomime, and Kapitonova was well equipped for this, showing off various sides of the character — whether this was the coquettish side or the ghoulish one — with just the right amount of thoughtful exaggeration. In particular it was her madness scenes that impressed. This was largely due to Kapitonova’s ability to imbue her character with a naturalistic and scattered descension into madness rather than an overwrought devolve of the mind. An Ophelia-like childishness to the descent generated much sympathy and was grimly convincing. In the second act, Kapitonova continued to deliver superb jumps that eventually turned into a particularly dizzying variation of chaînées that astounded all the more.
Yocum was slightly less adept at ballet pantomime, yet still managed to act the part of the playboy quite well with his overt courteousness and coy tosses of the head. He and Kapitonova were well paired, as they not only shared chemistry but did an excellent job at showing off each other’s talents. His own jumps and solos were sprightly, and his strong stage presence made him shine all the more.
Craig and Atkins also delivered admirable performances as Hilarion and Myrtha, respectively. In the scene featuring his character’s impending death, Craig showed excellent control. His formerly robust jumps melted into a mess of exhaustion that displayed real discipline. Atkins, with her sweeping arabesques and delicate footwork, brought a haunting quality to the piece as she often appeared to be floating across the stage. Though she might have begun the performance with a slight hint of trepidation — evident in her at times restrained movements — Atkins danced, by the end, with a lightness and commanding spirit that proved her worthy of this difficult role.
The expansive set featured the beautiful period costumes and even more impressive almost-Impressionistic scenery courtesy of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. In the hunting scene, the appearance of two real life Irish Wolfhounds came as a delightful surprise. It was details like these that lent the show an authenticity that brought this production onto another level entirely.
Overall characterized by its expert dancing, thoughtful partnerships, and wildly extravagant set, Ponomarenko’s “Giselle” was a beautiful and original take on a classic that celebrated tradition while heightening and expounding on its original elements.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Politician” predicted the now-infamous college admissions scandal completely by accident. In a plotline from the first episode, Payton Hobart insists that his admission to Harvard is fair and merited — unlike his brothers'. “The college admissions thing was totally psychic,” Ben Platt, who plays Payton on the show, said.
That foresight is indicative of the way that the show — about high-functioning teenage politicians enmeshed in a tense student body election — speaks to the present moment. “It’s now, in the best possible way, trendy to be politically involved, and to have a voice, and to be heard,” Platt said. “I think that it's really no coincidence that this is the show happening while that’s the movement, and I think if anything, hopefully fans the flames of that a bit.”
Seated at a polished wooden table in the Boston Athenaeum — a storied library not unlike one of the show’s recurring settings — Platt was joined by co-star Julia Schlaepfer, who plays Payton’s First Lady-esque girlfriend Alice Charles, to discuss the new show.
Co-created by Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy, “The Politician” follows the political ambitions of a young presidential (and Harvard) hopeful, whose path to power is paved with tragedy, backstabbing, and preppy designer costumes.
“Racks of designer clothes,” Schlaepfer said. “Sometimes you just go in for an hour to go and play dress-up all day.”
The show also represents the first product of Murphy’s $300 million deal with Netflix, the biggest producer contract in television history, according to the Hollywood Reporter. While the gravitas did not escape the actors on set — “It’s Ryan’s first Netflix show, and the optics have been, I’ve felt, a little bit scary,” Platt admitted — the acclaimed producers’ easygoing professionalism put the performers at ease.
“The wonderful thing about Brad, Ian, and Ryan is that they just are our biggest fans,” Schlaepfer said. “I remember Ryan was so worried that we didn’t like the show, and he wanted to make sure we all liked it. They don’t put any pressure on us at all.”
Platt agreed. “In the making of it, you feel very protected because Brad, Ian, and Ryan know exactly what they’re doing, and they’re delivering on all levels as far as the design, and the people that are shooting it, and the cinematography, and the writing,” he said. “So you feel like, ‘This is something fantastic. And I have no choice but to rise to the occasion and bring my best work.’”
An added reason to bring their best work might have been the star-studded ensemble cast, which includes the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange. In particular, Platt lauded Paltrow, who plays Payton’s disaffected mother Georgia.
“She’s effervescent and lovely, like a ray of light, and really just was incredibly protective and maternal towards me,” Platt said. “I think she knew — we both did — that this relationship was going to be a really important one for the show.”
Paltrow’s character even satirizes her own real-life wellness guru persona. “She really took an interest in me as a person, even when she’s in between takes making billion dollar-decisions for Goop,” Platt joked.
Meanwhile Lange, whose repertoire mostly comprises drama, was able to flex little-known comedic muscles. “I think you expect her to be a really brilliant dramatic actress, which she is. But I think that a surprise for all of us, particularly for me, was what a brilliant comedian she is,” Platt said.
Even alongside these industry heavyweights, though, both young actors have managed to make names for themselves. For Platt, who originated and won a Tony for the lead role of the Broadway musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” portraying industrious, power-hungry Payton Hobart was a significant departure from quiet, socially anxious Evan Hansen.
“Physically, that was one of my favorite shifts to make, because he’s so the opposite of Payton,” Platt said. “It was fun to be reminding myself that, ‘You’re no longer having to be fiddling with your shirt. You’re no longer having to hide in the corner. You can come in and hold your head high.’”
Meanwhile, Schlaepfer found herself turning toward real-life political figures for physical inspiration when it came to understanding her character.
“I studied a lot of young Hillary with Bill when all the scandal happened,” Schlaepfer said, “and you know, her drive to stand by him, and to support him, and love him. I was really fascinated by that. And so I watched a lot of interviews of the two of them during that time. And just wanted to study her physical behavior, to try and figure out as much as I could.”
By contrast, Platt turned to fictive reference points in shaping his characterization of Payton.
“Peyton definitely has some Tracy Flick, for sure,” he said, referencing Reese Witherspoon’s “iconic performance” in “Election,” released in 1999. “I love Reese Witherspoon more than life. I also think there’s a bit of John Malkovich in ‘Dangerous Liaisons’ in [Payton] a little bit. I drew on that slightly. And then it’s hard not to draw the Rachel Berry parallels, given the tone and given the drive.”
Though their characters certainly exhibit ruthless ambition, it was crucial for both Platt and Schlaepfer to temper the Machiavellian tendencies with human ones.
“Self-doubt and vulnerability — for me, that was the stuff that felt really satisfying,” Platt said. “This is the way that you can ensure that Peyton is someone you want to follow, or at least want to, are fascinated by, if not rooting for. When those feel like they’re earned enough and big enough, when you’re doing the stuff that’s a bit colder, meaner, [...] you get to go a lot farther because you know you’ve got this moment coming.”

The first of October is the national day of China. This year, it was even the 70th anniversary of the momentous day Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People’s Republic of China at Tiananmen Square. Claiming that “the Chinese people… have now stood up [against the] oppression and exploitation by foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary governments,” Mao announced on October 1, 1949 that “the era in which the Chinese people were regarded as uncivilized is now ended.”
Alongside the symbolic anniversary, I have been reflecting about what it means to be Chinese. And especially as protests in Hong Kong, a place where I have grown up and lived in, continue for the fourth month, in no small part due to the interference from the central Chinese government, I am grappling with the significant identity crisis — whether to identify as a Hong Konger, a Hong Konger in China, a Chinese person in Hong Kong, or Chinese — that many of my fellow Hong Kongers are facing.
Many Hong Kongers recognize that we have lived under legal protections of religion, expression, and assembly and are guaranteed free trials and human rights, most of which are unavailable in mainland China. British colonization, although morally wrong and historically indefensible, left us with a robust rule of law and the promise that our fundamental human rights would be preserved for at least a few decades.
As China justifies its actions during the Tiananmen Square massacre by pointing towards the stability and economic boom that the country has experienced in the past decade, we in Hong Kong cannot help but point towards the atrocity that happened when the army was pitted against its people, the Uyghurs who are forced into re-education camps, and the lawyers who are persecuted for defending human rights. Conscience preclude us from falling in line with the national story and identity that Beijing is spinning.
In China, this view would be dismissed as a blind fondness for foreign powers or a selfish attempt to pit the Chinese people’s government against outside forces. And this is internally coherent with both Mao’s rhetoric at the founding of China and the current government’s understanding of Chinese history — that the modern Chinese state has overcome a “century of humiliation” for the Chinese race. By solely emphasizing the solidarity among Chinese people against foreign powers, the Chinese government has carefully curtailed a narrative that frames democracy as a Western trap and dismisses popular discontent and legitimate demands as foreign conspiracies to divide Chinese unity. According to the Chinese government, one can either buy into its narrative and its version of Chinese identity or betray their Chinese identity.
Undeniably, there is a national interest in cultivating patriotism and stemming the growth of independence or separatist movements, to the limits of a government’s legitimacy. But to ignore the opinions that motivate these tendencies and to deny the right to these opinions is autocratic and delegitimizing. I believe that Hong Kong independence movements are unrealistic, counterproductive and willfully neglectful of the shared cultural and ethnical identities among Chinese people. However, the recent rise of these sentiments is only a symptom of the very real fears of crackdowns and violations by the Chinese government. In fact, Hong Kong independence was never a supported movement even under British colonization. But as the national narrative about identity seems to revolve around the monolithic gratitude towards the revitalization of the Chinese race, Hong Kongers have become more inclined to believe that the current protests are “the last stand” and more have abandoned their Chinese identity.
As we deviate from this predetermined identity of what it means to be Chinese, what are we left with? Can one be Chinese without loyally buying into what it means — for the Chinese government — to be Chinese?
I believe so. Harvard, as former University President Charles W. Eliot’s, Class of 1853, quote on Dexter gate says, encourages students to “Enter to grow in wisdom” and “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” I believe that to fulfill this honorable patriotic duty is not to be blindly nationalistic or to be an apologist about the darker parts of a country’s history. One should love one’s country not because of indoctrination or intimidation. Rather, one should rejoice in one’s national identity because of a shared sense of pride in its history, culture, or fundamental beliefs. Therefore, when facing the human rights violations of the autocratic government, one's duty to their country and kind compels one to speak up and criticise immorality.
I am proud to be a Chinese Hong Konger. My cultural heritage, from gatherings over yum-cha to the actual tradition of brewing tea, has been exported around the world, and my ethnicity is an unerasable component of how I was raised, who I am, and how I see the world. But I regret that this culture and ethnicity is now being championed by a government who purportedly claims to protect its people, yet, at the same time, fails to even respect their basic human rights, dignity, and value.
So for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the modern Chinese state, I call on Chinese students at Harvard to love their country — not by unthinkingly accepting the nationalistic narrative and identity, but by loving and respecting their fellow citizens and being responsible citizens and citizen-leaders who critically consider what is best for their country and kind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let me tell you about the time I got professionally hustled.
It’s fall 2017 — my first semester at Harvard. Having never touched the world of tech entrepreneurship, and seeing the startup scene at the Harvard Innovation Labs, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and MassChallenge, I was itching to try my hand at running a venture.
Enter a new inter-Ivy League honors society — let’s call it AVC for “Actually a Venture Capitalist” — running a huge New England pitch competition where the top three teams win $10,000 each. I had never seen more than a few hundred dollars at a time — to be able to spend $10,000 working on a project of my own choosing seemed too good to be true. I rounded up two equally naive friends of mine and we got to work.
We spent nearly three months tirelessly preparing the engineering and business models for this competition. With a combined total of three weeks of technical expertise under our belts (i.e., one week of an introductory computer science class), we sought the help of engineers at the Active Learning Labs and created a mechanical prototype. And with not even a single day in a macro or microeconomics lecture), we cold-called dozens of business development gurus on LinkedIn for advice. We quit comps and stunted new relationships to put time into seeing our venture succeed. After many sacrifices and weeks of work later, we had our product.
We called it Kumo Drones. Kumo, which means “spider” in Japanese, aimed to create a highly flexible peer-to-peer drone delivery network in densely clustered college towns for academic researchers to exchange samples and specimens across campuses. We envisioned a future where increased collaboration in research generated faster and more impactful discoveries to help advance humanity.
We submitted our slide deck and sent over all our engineering documents. Kumo Drones was ready for its first win.
The huge competition was not as huge as we had expected it to be. Competing for the top three spots, only three teams showed up: A team of Ph.D. students four years into creating their product, another team of business school students engineering a new cryptocurrency coin, and us, three baby-faced amateurs fresh out of high school.
Surprise, surprise: We placed top three. We sat on a coffee table with our slide deck pulled up on my laptop and pitched our venture. After some half-hearted nods and grunts, we got a pat on the back and a photo with all three teams huddled around one certificate that I could have gotten from a Dave and Buster’s birthday party. That was it. A few days later, AVC’s emails bounced, its website went offline, and it had all of our intellectual property.
I was mad. After putting our blood, sweat, and dropped problem sets on the line, we came home with nothing. Saying yes to this venture in effect made me so say no to hundreds of other opportunities. I felt like I wasted my freshman fall.
So I told the story in a different way. I told myself that I placed top three in my first ever pitch competition against teams of MBAs and Ph.D.’s — technically true, but truthful omission in reality. I kept this version of the story to convince myself that I was a natural in the entrepreneurial world. Deep down, though, I knew this was a lie.
It took me a while to finally swallow my pride. Today, I’m okay with saying my first “win” in entrepreneurship was not as impressive as I’d like it to be. I’m okay with having been that wide-eyed freshman, optimistic and unassuming of others. And I’m okay with asserting that while I’ve learned a lot in this journey, I’ve only scratched the surface.
The stories we tell ourselves dictate our truths. The power of controlling the narrative is a power I still struggle to deal with today. Before, I called myself an early success ready for more wins. But that story doesn’t take into account the setbacks and struggles that come along the way. So I’ve revised it: I’m just a guy who’s been lucky enough to mess up so many times that the right path becomes slightly clearer by the day.
Two years later, I’m thankful to have been hustled my freshman fall. Though we didn’t make it out with $10,000 or even a certificate of participation, I take from that experience something greater. At the end of my time at Harvard, I don’t want to leave with just a list of accomplishments — prizes awarded, funds raised, titles earned. I want to leave with a killer toolbox. I left the competition with a faux trophy. Two years later, I have better tools, and the lessons I learned that semester endure in everything I create.
Consider this an open letter to AVC, from the Kumo Drones team: Thank you for leading us down an unanticipated path. We’re better because of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has been under attack since the Trump administration announced its intent to terminate the program, putting the status of approximately 800,000 DACA recipients around the nation at risk. The University of California has fought this decision and it is the subject of upcoming Supreme Court hearings, for which Harvard has submitted an amicus brief in support of the program.
We commend Harvard for representing and advocating for its students on the national scene and urge the administration to continue doing so. Our undocumented peers are facing a difficult time as their safety and the validity of their presence in this country is attacked while the whole nation watches. In light of the scale of the uncertainty they face, Harvard must defend and advocate for their well-being in all facets of college life. To the extent that the amicus brief furthers those ends, we support it.
That said, we are concerned that the brief also perpetuates a harmful narrative. Framing this issue as one limited to “remarkable” students is harmful for undocumented immigrants who are not students at institutions like Harvard. The immigration system is already a meritocratic one — where one’s humanity is measured by how well one does in school or what income one can contribute to the country — and Harvard needs to take a stance that advocates for all undocumented immigrants, not just those who measure up to Harvard’s standard for being “remarkable.” Exceptionalism has no place in a humane immigration system, and Harvard must be conscious of the narrative that this brief buys into.
To truly honor the humanity of undocumented students, Harvard’s advocacy cannot stop here. Harvard’s defense of DACA students must also be extended to undocumented students who do not benefit from DACA. The voices of undocumented students have been silenced in national conversations surrounding immigration reform because all of the focus has been on DACA. Due to cutoff dates for the law’s applicability, many students do not qualify for DACA and are thus not able to legally work or be safe from deportation. Advocating for just DACA is no longer enough. Harvard must unequivocally advocate for all undocumented students, with or without DACA. Period.
Meanwhile, we urge Harvard to take initiative and actively support immigration initiatives on campus, such as the TPS Coalition. TPS holders are especially under threat in light of the program’s possible termination, pending court cases, in 2020. Harvard not only has an obligation to its students, but also to its workers who dedicate both physical and emotional labor to the University.
Finally, we recognize and appreciate the efforts of the University of California system in taking legal action and bringing the case for undocumented students all the way to the Supreme Court. The Court now has the opportunity — indeed, the obligation — to recognize the humanity of undocumented immigrants all around the nation. Harvard, as a leading institution for higher learning, has a similar obligation to lead and continue to advocate for all its students, regardless of their immigration status, whose right to live, work, and belong in this country is under threat.

FM sat down with Thomas M. Scanlon, Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity, Emeritus, to chat about philosophy and the fourth and final season of NBC’s “The Good Place” — a comedy TV series created by Michael Schur ’97 about a woman who wakes up in the afterlife and must grapple with what it means to lead a moral life. Scanlon wrote an influential book on moral philosophy called “What We Owe to Each Other,” whose title was adopted into an episode of Schur’s series.
Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Tell us more about your book, “What We Owe to Each Other.” What is the central message of the book, and how does it feature in “The Good Place?”
The central chapters, chapters four and five, set out and defend a way of thinking about a certain aspect of morality I want to call “what we owe to each other.” This doesn’t cover all of what we normally call “morality,” but it captures a central section of it: Our obligations to other people in general. The idea is that actions are wrong if a principle that permitted that action couldn’t be justified to the affected people in the right way.That’s what gets featured in “The Good Place.”
FM: How did you become involved in the TV series “The Good Place”?
I had no role in its genesis. Well, only a really, really indirect one. If you’re a professor in a place like Harvard or Princeton, you get really good students, undergraduates and grad students. I had a student named Pamela Hieronymi who was a graduate student here, and now teaches at UCLA. And because she had written a paper on the question of whether you could become a good person by trying to become a good person, Michael Schur got in touch with her. And she became a consultant on the show. When she was talking about different views of morality, she mentioned mine as one possibility. So he went and looked at the book.
FM: Has the show fairly represented your philosophical views?
I think they did a very good job. I could quibble a little bit with exactly how [Michael Schur] formulates my views, but I wouldn’t blame it on him rather than on me.
It’s a weird thing to have your book appear as a character on a TV show. It’s sort of like having your child chosen to be in the school play. You’re pleased that they’re there, but worried that something embarrassing is going to happen. But so far not. There was this one scene where somebody mentions to [the protagonist] Eleanor that she ought to be concerned with “what we what we owe to each other.” She Googles it, and she comes up with a YouTube video of Chidi [a character who is a philosophy professor] giving a lecture in which he says: “As the philosopher Tim Scanlon said decades ago…” [laugh] That was really, really weird to see. Of course, I wrote a book and I hoped people would read it, but, anyway, it was a shock.
FM: How do you think that a subject like philosophy should be presented to the general public? Does “The Good Place” achieve this?
I think that one of the remarkable things about “The Good Place” is that it manages to make people feel the pull of these different philosophical positions. Maybe Chidi makes people see why he decided to reject utilitarianism or Kant or whatever. And so it does get people to go through some of the steps that lead to arriving at one kind of conclusion or the other, rather than just being told the conclusion.
FM: Which character do you most identify with?
Well, how could I identify with any character other than Chidi? [Actor] Will Harper gets a lot of credit for this. He really captures a certain kind of academic character: Indecisive, concerned to sweat the details in a way that other people don’t even bother with, and a certain kind of earnestness. He really gets it. I just hope that being like that isn’t going to be made too much fun of.
FM: The ‘Good Place’ and the ‘Bad Place’ both exist in the universe of the show. What is your conception of the ‘Bad Place’?
In a famous play called “No Exit,” philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre says hell is other people. In my view, you could say hell is other people, that is to say, hell is the relationship with other people that you create by treating them badly. My idea of the bad place is the place that you’re in where you’ve spoiled your relations with the other people you’re living with, and you can’t be friends or trust each other, or do any of the things that you’re supposed to do when you interact with friends or even strangers.
FM: Last but not least, why study philosophy?
It’s worth studying philosophy if you’re curious about why you think what you think. The reason to study philosophy is it’s good to have a better understanding of the ideas that we’re acting on, and maybe we would find mistakes that we were overlooking.

In front of an empty, overgrown lot, at an intersection a block away from Central Square’s Massachusetts Ave. hub, I crane my neck, looking for audio sensors that might be able to detect a gunshot.
In Cambridge, ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology, has been in use since 2014. On May 21, the sensors detected gunfire from the location where I’m standing and alerted police. When police arrived, they found five bullet holes in a building but no shell casings injuries.
Here’s how ShotSpotter works: Audio sensors are placed above street level — on the tops of buildings, maybe telephone poles — listening for what Sam Klepper ’87, senior vice president of Marketing and Product Strategy at ShotSpotter, describes as “loud, impulsive sounds.” If ShotSpotter employees deem the sound a gunshot, they alert the local police department.
To Cambridge police, ShotSpotter acts as “another tool in our toolbox,” says Jeremy H. Warnick, the Cambridge Police Department spokesperson.
Across the street, jumbled telephone wires hang low, and paint peels from a building. A woman in a bright red shirt pushes a shopping cart. The street is silent except for its metallic rattle. She stops in front of me. I stick out as some college-age kid with a notebook. She begins explaining that she needs to go get her laundry. Two days ago, she had open heart surgery. As she tells me this, she smiles sympathetically, as if I’m the one who had surgery.
“You have a nice day,” she says, and the rattling begins again. I wonder if our conversation could be intelligibly recorded by ShotSpotter audio sensors.
ShotSpotter technology might not immediately inspire privacy concerns. After all, the sidewalk is public space — ShotSpotter’s sensors aren’t inside private homes or cars. But in 2018, as part of a growing national conversation surrounding police acquisitions of surveillance technology, Cambridge passed a first-of-its-kind ordinance in the Boston metropolitan area, requiring all surveillance technology to be reviewed by the city council for approval.
As a result, ShotSpotter’s future in Cambridge isn’t guaranteed. As debates about privacy and efficacy loom, a broader question remains: Does a technology like ShotSpotter belong in Cambridge at all?
There’s no guarantee that ShotSpotter’s sensors couldn’t pick up my conversation with the woman. It’s a concern that many privacy advocates share.
“Whether they are or are not used for that purpose [is] a legitimate question to ask,” says Chad A. Marlow, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberty Union, regarding the ability of ShotSpotter to monitor street-level conversations. Marlow spearheaded the ACLU’s Community Control Over Police Surveillance campaign, which produced model legislation that inspired Cambridge’s surveillance ordinance.
A privacy audit conducted by New York University’s Policing Project concluded that “the risk of voice surveillance was extremely low in practice.” ShotSpotter has donated to the Policing Project since 2018, and ShotSpotter’s CEO, Ralph Clark, is on the organization’s advisory board. Still, the report allows that it’s possible that sensors will pick up and record “intelligible voice audio related to a gunfire incident.”
The city council guard of 2010 had expressed an interest in the technology. But, when ShotSpotter was finally installed in June 2014, the 2014 guard had no jurisdiction over its use — there wasn’t even a city council vote.
“But it was something that the council was notified of, in advance of it being activated in the public,” Warnick says.
ShotSpotter was acquired the same way many police technologies are acquired across the country — through Department of Homeland Security grants developed after 9/11, a product of increased Congressional “focus on state and local homeland security assistance,” according to a 2016 Congressional Research Service report.
The money for ShotSpotter comes from the Urban Area Security Initiative grant program, which is designed to help secure “high-threat, high-density urban areas” that might need to respond to acts of terrorism, according to DHS’s determination.
The Boston Office of Emergency Management distributes the funds — which, in 2019, totaled $16.9 million dollars. The only requirement is that UASI funds are used on items from the FEMA authorized equipment list, which includes gunshot detection technology as, “Network, Acoustic Sensor Triangulation,” but also air-purifying respirators and “explosive detecting canines.”
This process of funding local law enforcement through the federal government has spurred concerns among privacy advocates, because the outside funding allows municipal police departments to obtain new technologies without city council approval.
“We were caught in this cycle of effectively playing whack-a-mole, where technologies were obtained largely in the dark, behind closed doors without any public debate or democratic accountability,” said Kade Crockford, the director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts.
While the text of the surveillance ordinance includes “gunshot detection and location hardware and services” within its definition of surveillance technology, the role of ShotSpotter specifically in Cambridge will be open to debate.
The surveillance ordinance went into effect on Sept. 10. By March, the city manager must submit a “Surveillance Use Policy” which proposes authorized uses, guidelines on data collection, and oversights for every department that “possesses or uses Surveillance Technology.” This means that Cambridge Police Department must release information on any other surveillance technologies in use, including ShotSpotter. Eventually, per the ordinance, the city manager will also have to submit an annual surveillance report to the Cambridge City Council, including an analysis of audits, costs, community responses, and the civil rights and liberty implications of a given technology’s use.
Last month, the Cambridge Police Department conducted routine tests of ShotSpotter. On Twitter, a video of the testing shows a dimly lit nighttime scene: Cambridge police officers shoot into a box propped on top of an orange truck.
The accompanying tweet from a Boston 25 reporter reads, “If you’re hearing gunshots right now in #Cambridge don’t be alarmed.”
Most Cambridge residents probably would be alarmed: Cambridge has relatively low rates of gun violence.
There have been eight confirmed shooting incidents in Cambridge since the beginning of 2019, along with two reports of gunfire since the beginning of October. By contrast, at least 122 shooting incidents have already transpired so far this year in the neighboring city of Boston.
While ShotSpotter is used nationally — in cities as large as New York and Chicago, but also as small as Somerville and Revere — its efficacy is still in question.
ShotSpotter promises “a service level of at least detecting 90 percent of all outdoor gunfire,” According to Klepper. For shootings within its Cambridge coverage area, it has a detection rate of around 83 percent — 5 shootings out of 6 total detected.
But out of 22 ShotSpotter activation alerts in Cambridge thus far this year, only four have corresponded with actual confirmed shooting events. This gives ShotSpotter a false positive rate of about 82 percent.
Anything from a car engine backfiring to snowplows driving over manhole covers to even the noise of a bicycle tire popping can contribute to false positive activations.
In Fall River, the prevalence of these false positives led to an overextension of officer resources. Besides, shooting incidents that were later confirmed often had accompanying 911 calls from Fall River residents. So, in 2018, the Fall River police department shuttered its ShotSpotter program.
Even with the presence of false positives, Warnick sees ShotSpotter activations as just another call for service — similar to any 911 call. He hasn’t found ShotSpotter to create an additional strain on officer resources.
To that end, Crockford, the ACLU representative, suggests that the CCOPS-dictated approval process provides a critical avenue for evaluating a given technology’s efficacy.
Claims and metrics of the effectiveness of surveillance technology can be “cherry-picked by people who have a lot to gain, even financially, from the spread of these tools,” says Crockford. That’s another reason why the ACLU’s CCOPS ordinances are necessary: “What we need is a fuller picture, the complete picture actually, of how law enforcement is using these technologies,” she says.
Farhang Heydari ’07, the executive director of the Policing Project, says that using federal grant money to obtain policing technology isn’t inherently bad. Often, he says, departments have budgetary constraints that can hamstring attempts to acquire technologies that might improve policing. He pointed to an example: After the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., the Department of Justice issued grants so that local law enforcement could invest in body cameras.
Still, democratic oversight is critical, he says. “We’ve seen across the country police departments have acquired predictive policing technologies, different sorts of databases and social media crawling technologies without any sort of public approval.”
Cambridge is one of 13 jurisdictions in the nation that has passed a CCOPS surveillance ordinance that allows for elected bodies to dictate what kinds of police technologies exist in a community.
For now, ShotSpotter technology exists in Cambridge. Soon, it’s presence will be debated. Whether or not it remains in Cambridge is up to the people.

To properly mold a dumpling, my mom tells me, you first need to ensure that you have the correct amount of filling. Too much, and filling will leak out the sides, sullying the boiling water and causing it to fall apart. Too little, and each bite will be too doughy and unsatisfying.
I’m seven or eight years old, and I nod as I watch my mom deftly scoop xian’er, or dumpling filling, from an aluminum bowl into a dumpling skin settled neatly in her palm, showing her that I’ve heard her instructions. Her sleeves are rolled up, her hair is tucked behind her ears, and flour covers her hands and sprinkles her navy blue apron. Her fingers flutter over the dough, seemingly without thought: a fold over the filling, a pinch in the middle, and a couple squeezes between her thumb and the side of her index finger at each end to form a line of perfect creases. Before long, these crescents stuffed with meat, spring onions, and ginger fill the plate next to her, and I impatiently look on as I know only a brief spell in the pot separates me from devouring them.
At this age, I’m simply an observer. I watch and listen, tucking the images of my mom’s skill away in my mind. But I’m still a child and I look to my mom for guidance. Just learning is enough.
By eleven or twelve, I begin helping. Glad that I can finally participate, my mom trusts me with the easiest task: Now I don the apron as I roll out skin after skin, and my side of the cutting board is dotted with lopsided white circles. I’ve learned how to position the rolling pin so that the dough underneath rotates unassisted, and I marvel at how each thumb-sized ball I start with magically flattens into a disk. After dozens of attempts, their edges begin to smooth; they are uniform and neat. Now I ask eagerly to assist every time I notice my mom making dumplings, excited to show off my new skill.
One day, when I’m a teenager, she challenges me to expand my skill set — she tells me to fold the dumplings. Even though I’ve watched her mold them perfectly hundreds of times, my own hands disobey my brain. As I pinch the edges and work my way toward the center, the filling leaks out the sides, making my fingers sticky. While my mom’s dumplings are curved, neat, and creased along the fold, mine are flat, misshapen, and lack uniformity. Soon my mom scoops the dumpling I’m struggling to fold out of my hands. She curves her palm around it, pinches the sides, and within seconds my disaster is fixed. She kindly tells me I just need practice, and I am relieved to hand the task over to her. I go back to my familiar job of rolling out the skins, still able to help but unable to do more.
***
It’s the summer before my freshman year of college, and my mom is trying to teach me as many recipes as she can before I leave for school. One day, she approaches me — she wants me to make dumplings from scratch, all on my own. While I’m usually enthusiastic about cooking together, that day I balk.
I’m scared — not scared to mess up, because I know I will. If I have learned anything about cooking this summer, it’s that I’m a clumsy mess in the kitchen. My knife cuts are irregular, and most vegetables I stirfry come out in varying degrees of doneness. I lack culinary intuition, constantly questioning if what I’m doing is correct.
When it came to dumplings, I have always been the helper and never the chef. When I placed each circle of dough into my mom’s hand, it was more than just a step of a recipe; I was trusting that she would always be there. Cooking with her was comforting; it felt like home, and it felt like childhood.
The more she asks, however, the harder it becomes to say no. Finally I agree, and I find myself wearing my mom’s navy blue apron. Beginning the recipe feels like a step forward that I can never take back. I sink my hands into the mixture of flour and water, and I feel myself sinking into adulthood. The dough clings to my hands as I try to pull my hands out of the bowl, leaving dredges that dangle from my fingertips. I’m frustrated as I try to shake them off, and it feels like I’m trying to shake away the reality that I’m trying so hard to avoid: I have to grow up soon.
The apprehension sticks to the back of my mind in the same way the dough sticks to my fingers. I grow more unsure of myself: My mom stops me before I add an ingredient out of sequence, I ask her to repeat a step for the third time, and my dumplings fall over themselves after I fold them.
The dumplings have finally finished boiling, and I lift the lid of the pot. I ladle each doughy lump onto a plate — this step, at least, I have practiced many times. I pluck one from the platter with my chopsticks, steam billowing into the air. I blow on it once and gingerly bite off half, taking care not to burn myself.
I nervously wait for the flavor to hit my tongue. After a few seconds the taste registers. It’s different from my mom’s — maybe slightly saltier — even though I followed her instructions exactly. But it’s still familiar, still good.
I’m relieved that I haven’t completely botched the recipe, but also surprised that I don’t mind the slight foreignness of the taste and texture. Somehow, I don’t feel the burden to perfectly imitate my mom’s dish anymore. I’ve learned enough from my mom to make it differently — even unintentionally. Rather than leaving my childhood behind, I’m equipped to take it with me. And, wherever I am, making dumplings will always remind me of home.

A row of colorful, plastic-wrapped toothbrushes –– like the ones dentists hand out after an appointment –– lines a shelf in Christina Warinner’s office at the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Their presence is a bit ironic, as Warinner’s research seems to put her at odds with dental hygiene: some of her most important discoveries come from residue left on the teeth of ancient humans.
As an anthropologist, Warinner studies the relationship between humans, their food, and their microbiomes. By examining traces of food and microorganisms left behind on dental tartar, paleofeces, and ancient ceramics, she is able to uncover lost details of human history that can inform modern humans’ diets and health. Warinner is part microbiologist, part paleogeneticist, part human evolutionary scientist.
“Food is something that unites and connects people all over the world. It’s something we all do every day, and it’s deeply embedded both in culture and biology,” Warinner says. “And people have solved the problem of food in vastly different ways around the world.”
Her interest in food and molecular anthropology has taken her across the globe to countries like Mexico, Nepal, and Mongolia. Recently, she has been working on the Eastern Steppe in Mongolia to study the origins and proliferation of dairy technology. She views dairying as a field “where culture and biology meet,” and she is fascinated by the ways humans have manipulated microbial cultures to ferment and transform animal milk. (One of her favorite foods is aaruul, Mongolian dried milk curds.)
When most people think about the rise of the Mongolian Empire, they think of Ghenghis Khan. But Warinner attributes some of the Empire’s success to a more humble source. “We think we’ve actually captured the introduction of dairy technology during the Bronze Age in Mongolia, which subsequently supported the rise of empire there,” she says. Using the remnants of milk proteins on teeth, she uncovered how herding and dairy preservation afforded Mongolian societies the nomadic freedom to spread and eventually conquer their neighbors.
***
Warinner was born in a suburb of Kansas City, but her academic interests have always been all over the map. Growing up, she loved subjects spanning the humanities and the sciences, from chemistry to history to microbiology to Latin, and she struggled to pick an academic focus. “It wasn't until I got to college that I learned about the field of anthropology and realized that there was a discipline in which all of these different interests could reside,” she says.
Warinner hopes to use her knowledge of ancient diets and health to demystify contemporary nutritional science. This fall, in her new course Anthropology 1255: “Human Diet: From Neanderthals to the Future of Food,” Warinner aims to give students “a perspective on the really long history of food … and the tools and the information they need to evaluate some of the claims that are happening.” Her biggest piece of advice for eating healthy in the modern world is to eat a variety of fresh food from the sections along the walls of the grocery store — the produce, meat, dairy, and bakery sections — while avoiding the processed corn, wheat, and soy products from the center aisles.
Warinner devotes herself to outreach and education beyond the academic sphere. “I feel like we have, as academics, a real responsibility to educate the public,” she says. “And I feel like as archeologists, we’re in a position to do it in a way that's more accessible than other fields.” She has published 75 percent of her articles open-access, given two TED talks, and been featured in several videos and online lectures.
Her favorite outreach project was editing a children’s coloring book called “Adventures in Archeological Science.” The book has been translated into more than 30 languages — including Nepali; Tibetan; Brazilian Portuguese; and Nahuatl, the Aztec language that is still spoken by almost two million people in Mexico. Warinner believes in making her outreach materials accessible in the countries she works in and in smaller communities that speak Indigenous languages. “This could be an opportunity for us to explain what we do and why it’s important, and maybe even encourage children in these places to get interested in archaeology and become archeologists themselves,” she says.
In her upcoming work, Warinner hopes to apply new biomedical technologies to the field of archeology, use modern breakthroughs to better understand the past, and incorporate both of these strategies into her curriculum.
“We’re in a period where we can start to ask questions we never even thought were imaginable before,” she says.

It all started with a flyer. Former Crimson editor Dara Horn ’99 sat with three friends in the basement of the Freshman Union — then the equivalent of Annenberg, but known today as the Barker Center — when she spotted a piece of paper that read, “Come try out for The Real Class of ’98.”
To this day, she isn’t quite sure what the flyer referred to, it sparked an idea for a play centered around one class. Twenty-four years later, this production would be an annual phenomenon and staple of the freshman theater community known as the “Froshical.”
One month into her freshman year, the notion that a group of freshmen could work on their very own theatrical production, without the interference of upperclassmen, intrigued Horn. At the time, she had been rejected from “literally every competitive creative organization,” she recalls.
And she wasn’t alone. Her eventual co-founders, Michelle Chen ’99 , Peter G. Chan ’99, and Jessica Hammer ’99, were under similar circumstances. “We knew a lot of people who were frustrated,” remembers Hammer.
The members of the original team met each other during the First Year Arts Program (FAP), a pre-orientation program for artistically-inclined freshman. In FAP, Horn says, she had found a space where she felt the creativity of the freshman class could blossom. The fall semester, by comparison, was a letdown: The competitive, hierarchical nature of Harvard’s extracurricular activities meant that students like Horn, who were eager to take on creative roles but lacked the necessary seniority or experience, were relegated to the the bench.
In response, the four students decided to put on a musical solely involving first years with the hopes of preventing a system of hierarchy where people were forced to “work their way up” as underclassmen.
Initially, the group didn’t think that much would come from it. They printed posters that read, “No comp. Free snacks. Come try out for the Freshman Musical” and pasted them around campus, hoping to garner at least a bit of interest. To their surprise, on the day of the first meeting, people did come — so many that the Canaday common room could barely accommodate them.
The final production, which both Chan and Horn estimated involved between eighty and one hundred first-years, was titled “Shakespeare in the Yard.”
While later productions would typically take the form of cohesive two-act musicals, “Shakespeare in the Yard” consisted of a series of scenes from Shakespeare plays, adapted to the first-year experience at Harvard. There was no one book-writer, director, or lyricist; the play was the collective effort of dozens of first-years who were willing to contribute bits and pieces of their time.
According to Hammer, the prevailing attitude amongst its creators was, “Why not? Let's try it, and let's find out what we don't know by doing it. And let's find out who we are as creators through the process of making.”
In retrospect, she thinks a large part of the four’s ability to move forward on the project actually lay in their relative inexperience. “Ignorance was maybe not bliss, but it was the willingness to take a risk,” she says. “In retrospect, that was great, because if we understood the full consequences of lots of the things we do, we'd be terrified.”
And the end product, performed in April of 1996 in Agassiz House Theater, was, according to Horn, “kind of amazing.”
**
Nearly a quarter-century later, the First-Year Musical operates a little differently.
The process of change began the next year, when the musical became an established, annual event. “We basically started from scratch,” says Yoon-Ho A. “Alex” Lee ’00, an executive in that year’s musical. “We applied to be an officially recognized organization with a budget and a bank account, all of that.” The tradition of each creative team choosing its successors via a written application and interviews also began with the class of ’00.
While seemingly contradictory to the “no comp” attitude taken by Froshical’s founders, Chloe E.W. Levine ’22, lyricist and co-vocal director for last year’s First-Year Musical, maintains that the founding ideology of making art accessible is still very much alive. Levine acknowledges that an eight-person executive team is limiting, “but it’s really just a core basis for everything else,” she says. “Any person who approached us and said they wanted to be involved in Froshical could be, no questions asked.”
This year, some of the logistical strain on the Froshical production team has been alleviated. For the first time in the musical’s history, the Office for the Arts (OFA) will facilitate its production. This change means that the student team will have easier access to funding and a guaranteed spot in the Agassiz Theater’s Spring season. The OFA is also planning to host a series of supplemental master classes on musical theater performance and production for freshman.
“[It’s about] giving them the tools that they need to feel confident about the product they’re creating,” says Dana E. Knox, OFA Production Coordinator and first-year musical faculty advisor.
Chen, Hammer, Chen, and Horn had no idea that the project they started in a Canaday common room in 1995 would become a longstanding tradition, and they seemed thrilled to hear that it is still a part of the freshman experience. Still, the competitive nature of the musical today raises questions. “Where is the place that people can try on these new roles? What is the opportunity for people who don't think of themselves as experts to take on roles in the theater community that may shape their lives in the long run?” Hammer asks. “I hope someone reading this article decides to pick up that challenge.”

Garbage was strewn across the bathroom floor. Old bottles of shampoo were left empty in the sink. In the common room, a large, sticky stain of spilled soda spread across the floor. The dorm was seemingly untouched since the summer school students had left. This was the first room Samuel Murdock ’23 slept in at Harvard.
Murdock is from Bay Shore, Long Island, a small hamlet beside the sea. He left home for Harvard five days early to participate in a pre-orientation program called Fall Clean-Up, or FCU, in which freshmen are paid $13.50 an hour to clean dorms before the rest of the student body arrives. Murdock was prepared to get dorms ready for his classmates. He did not expect to have to clean his own room, too.
Murdock began by wiping up the stain, taking out the trash, clearing the bathroom. He started to think it was a little odd — “a little awkward” — that the University wanted the rest of the student body to arrive to freshly cleaned dorms, while the Fall Clean-Up participants arrived to dirty ones. It made him feel like Harvard was telling him “that this particular group — FCU people — they don’t deserve or need the dorms to be cleaned for them, but that the incoming class does.” He wondered, “Why aren’t we treated with the same equity as the rest of the class that’s moving in?”
A few months before Murdock moved into Canaday, Harvard Graduate School of Education assistant professor Anthony A. Jack published a book that grappled with that very question. Jack’s book, “The Privileged Poor,” is based on hundreds of hours of interviews with students at a fictional prestigious university — referred to as “Renowned” in his book. Renowned has a program similar to Fall Clean-Up.
In his book, Jack, a tutor in Mather House, explores the ways colleges welcome — or fail to welcome — students to their campuses.
Fall Clean-Up widens class division at Harvard, Jack argues in an interview. “By virtue of how it stands within the orientation lineup,” he says, Fall Clean-Up provides an “economic incentive” for lower-income students to spend pre-orientation cleaning, while other freshmen might paint, volunteer, or backpack. This, in turn, facilitates “segregated networks — and segregated introductions to the University.”
Fall Clean-Up is the only pre-orientation that pays students. It asks them to clean — to excavate dorms filled with dust and debris, to leave the porcelain of their peers’ toilet bowls gleaming. The work can be difficult; the hours are long. Many feel they have no choice but to do Fall Clean-Up. Some contend that the program is “demeaning,” that it creates an uncomfortable power dynamic between students, and that it amplifies cultural stereotypes about who cleans. Others see it as an opportunity: They appreciate the work and the income it provides.
“One of the main goals we seek to achieve through these programs is to create opportunities for students to interact with and learn from fellow students who come from different backgrounds, locations, and carry different perspectives,” says Associate Dean for Student Engagement, and Acting Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging, Alexander R. Miller.
The First-Year Retreat and Experience, a pre-orientation program aimed at first-generation, lower-income students — now in its second year — complicates the decision further: Students from underrepresented backgrounds now must choose between earning $500 and learning to navigate the university they’re about to enter. Harvard only permits 30 students to enroll in both FCU and FYRE — most must choose one. While FYRE prepares students for their first year of school, FCU participants prepare students’ dorms.
The structure of Harvard’s pre-orientation programs, some students argue, divides those who can forgo a paycheck from those who cannot.
Brian K. Conwell ’22 is from Kodiak, Alaska, a small town of 6,000 on a remote island off of the state’s blustery southern coast. In high school, Conwell worked jobs at restaurants and cafes. At Harvard, he spent his first week in the Fall Clean-Up program. He recalls lively breakfasts in the Mather dining hall and days spent working with his team.
Conwell says he preferred the work of Fall Clean-Up to his high school service jobs. He liked the freedom it afforded — no hovering bosses, no arbitrary rules.
Weeks after Jack’s book was published, Temple University professor of education Sara Y. Goldrick-Rab tweeted, “Low-income students at HARVARD working 20 hours a week in their first year of college cleaning goddamn dorms?? And we keep giving this wealthy place our public dollars why exactly?” Her posts set off a furious online debate over the ethics of Dorm Crew and Fall Clean-Up; countless students and scholars weighed in on both sides of the dispute. Her criticism hit on a fundamental question: Is there something inherently wrong with Harvard paying some of its students to clean?
Conwell takes issue with Goldrick-Rab’s criticism of Fall Clean-Up; he does not believe the work should be “stigmatized,” and, in fact, finds it rewarding. “I think manual labor is great,” Conwell says. “I think that no one is above cleaning bathrooms, especially not Harvard students.”
Conwell further refuted Goldrick-Rab’s “20 hours” comment in an email: “This is a vaaaaast overstatement. I would even go so far to call that statement a lie.”
In an email, Goldrick-Rab responds to Fall Clean-Up participants who say they enjoy the work: “It is always possible to find people happy with the status quo and grateful for any opportunity. It hardly means their conditions are just.” She says that simply because participants like Conwell enjoy the program does not mean it should exist.
Ibrahim Ibrahim ’22 argues that the act of cleaning can’t be separated from who is doing it. “FCU is mostly kids that are from low-income backgrounds or some element of minority backgrounds. And the fact that they’re cleaning other kids’ dorms and bathrooms. . . it might sort of inject this false power dynamic in their heads.”
At Harvard, lower-income students and “a disproportionate number of black and Latinx students” clean, according to Jack. Data from The Crimson’s 2018 Freshman Survey indicates that 18 percent of students in Fall Clean-Up identified as black, compared to 4 percent in FOP. Jack contends that cleaning cannot be divorced from the history and stereotypes associated with the task: “You cannot ignore the implication of the fact that the only people — that many of the people who you see cleaning — at a university, typically, are black and Latinx,” he explains.
To Conwell, the criticisms of the power dynamic between peers is a “huge oversimplification” of the work of Fall Clean-Up. He enjoys the work — those who want to do it should be able to, he argues. He’s certainly observed that more lower-income students than affluent students participate in FCU, but he credits that to “the structure of our university and the structure of the way that people work in society.” Conwell holds that these class and power dynamics are larger institutional problems. They go beyond the individual students who participate in FCU: “I don’t think that should be any reason to castigate the students that are working themselves.”
The perceived tensions of Fall Clean-Up carry into the school year during its ongoing semester equivalent, Dorm Crew. While conducting his research, Jack found that Harvard Dorm Crew workers are at times treated dismissively by their peers — more as custodial staff than as fellow students. Their sense of belonging within the University suffers. These students see comments like a recent post on Harvard Confessions, an undergraduate Facebook page, accusing a Dorm Crew worker of stealing their possessions: “To whoever from dorm crew stole my airpods off my bed this morning: fuck you.” Some students who work Dorm Crew are made to feel “that though they may be, you know, at the school, they are not of it,” says Jack.
But not everyone feels that divide. One Friday night, Raul Cuevas Pelayo ’20 was cleaning a bathroom while students were hanging out in the suite’s common room. He says he felt a little “lame” compared to these other students. He was working on a Friday night; they were socializing. “Then as I walked out, I actually saw one of the people who lived there. And he thanked me. And he was just, like, a really cool dude.”
Still, there seems to be something fundamental about cleaning that skews Fall Clean-Up’s demographics. If a paid research assistance program was instituted as a pre-orientation option, Jack suggests that “you would see a much more even spread, or even an overrepresentation of students from more affluent backgrounds and prep schools applying for that program.” Students raised with more privilege, he predicts, would have the confidence to apply for such a program, while lower-income students might not.
Fall Clean-Up ended in early September. The work crews made group chats, promised weekly dinners, and then dissolved. After FCU, Ibrahim thought about doing Dorm Crew as a term-time job. His leaders encouraged it, emphasizing the flexibility and the pay — a starting wage of $16.25 per hour, with a minimum of two hours per week. But Ibrahim eventually decided against it, because to him, the work was “really demeaning.”
Murdock also chose not to do Dorm Crew after Fall Clean-Up, but he still wonders what it would have been like to knock on his peers’ doors, bucket in hand, and leave yellow post-its notes that read, “Your bathroom was cleaned by Sam. Let us know if you have comments, complaints, or compliments” fluttering on mirrors around campus.
For Murdock, one question lingers: “Imagine the scenario that you’re a Dorm Crew worker, and you get assigned to clean your own room. Like, why can’t people do it themselves?”
The earliest iteration of Dorm Crew arrived at Harvard in late 1950, in the form of the Student Porter Program. Before that, the University hired cleaners from outside the school, but they anticipated those workers would soon demand higher wages. The University was also looking to supplement the incomes of working-class students attending with the help of the GI Bill.
In the University’s eyes, the Student Porter Program killed two birds with one stone: a reliable supply of workers to clean dorms and additional income for some students. At first, the program faltered. Dunster House residents told The Crimson in 1951 they had concerns about the “degrading social stigma” associated with the job. Others noticed a decline in quality from the former maids’ work to that of the new student porters. But the program persisted, was rechristened ‘Dorm Crew,’ and grew to its current size of more than 800 affiliated students.
Through Dorm Crew’s history, as financial aid packages have expanded and students have had less obligation to earn money toward their tuition, some have observed, Dorm Crew’s numbers have shrunk. Jack’s “The Privileged Poor” describes a similar situation at Renowned: “When Renowned increased the amount of financial aid it granted to students, the number of students working fell below what was needed to ready the dorms for freshmen to move in.” Administrators at Renowned lobbied the office of the dean of freshmen to move Community Detail — Renowned’s Dorm Crew parallel — into the pre-orientation roster.
Fall Clean-Up became its own pre-orientation program in “the late nineties,” according to head Dorm Crew captain Benjamin E. Frimodig ’21, a former Crimson news editor. Until two years ago, Fall Clean-Up students had to pay out-of-pocket for their food during the week. In recent years, the program has added some additional advising and included HUDS meals.
Fall Clean-Up and Dorm Crew are woven into the fabric of how Harvard functions. But many schools, Jack observes, do not have similar programs: “I can imagine a world in which Dorm Crew does not exist, because Dorm Crew does not exist at the vast majority of places.” At the end of the day, Jack says, “Dorm Crew is not an essential element of life.”
Nia S. Warren ’23 remembers what the Yard looked like when she first set foot on Harvard’s campus for Fall Clean-Up. Each pre-orientation program had its own decorated table. She walked past the First-Year Outdoor Program, the First-Year Urban Program, and the First-Year Arts Program — each crowded with huge signs, bright t-shirts, and spirited students. Leaders were full of pep, waving over their respective freshmen, introducing themselves, and asking for names.
Warren looked around for the Fall Clean-Up table. It seemed plainer than the others; it had just a “small little sign, like it was nothing special,” Warren recalls, “[It was] kind of just like: we’re here because we’re getting paid.”
Harvard offers six pre-orientation programs in the week before Opening Days. FAP costs $460 before financial aid, while FOP costs $460 plus expenses for hiking shoes, backpacks, and other gear. The First-Year Urban Program, the First-Year International Program, and the First Year Retreat and Experience program are free; these programs do not cover incidentals besides room and board.
James A. Bedford ’20 is from Plymouth, England. He lives with his father on a boat because it is “cheaper than a house,” he adds, as if he has explained it a million times before. Like Warren, Bedford’s introduction to Harvard lacked fanfare: FCU skipped the cheers, and they got straight to work. Bedford felt out of place, just as the sight of trash in Murdock’s sink left him feeling neglected by the University. From the beginning, Bedford and Murdock felt that the University deemed them different from their peers.
It took Bedford some time to pinpoint exactly why he felt alienated. Amidst meeting other students and recovering from jetlag, he did not look around and think, “Oh, we’re all here because we’re poor and we need money.” At the time, he says he “had no conception of the” — here, his voice lowers in emphasis — “disparity that is present on this campus between rich and poor.” But shortly into his time at Harvard, he began to reconsider the way Fall Clean-Up functions: It distinguishes between the students who need to earn quick money for school supplies and those who do not.
Many of the students who end up participating in FCU would have liked to do other programs. “What turned me off about FUP at the time wasn’t what it was, but what it wasn’t. And it wasn’t a program that paid me,” Ibrahim says. “Fall Clean-Up gave me dollars, and I needed that.”
During pre-orientation, some students can afford to do what they love. Others don’t have that luxury.
Fall Clean-Up “is not a truly elective choice,” says Jack. Rather, it is a choice “made attractive by money, not because of an affinity.”
Though many students choose Fall Clean-Up to earn cash, neither the program’s mission statement nor its extensive “about” page mentions money. The University presents Fall Clean-Up as a program with the same goals as the other options, to foster relationships and gain access to resources. The financial reality of students tells a different story.
For Fall Clean-Up participants, the day begins at 9 a.m. Students head from Weld Basement to their assigned dorms, brooms in their hands and vacuums strapped to their backs. Around noon, they take a break for lunch, and then, at 3:45 p.m., the workday ends. Students are now free to do as they please. Their first priority: Shower off the layers of sweat and grime that have accumulated throughout the day. After cooling off in the dorms, some socialize, exploring the Square or playing basketball. Others are so exhausted from seven hours of cleaning that they sleep through much of the afternoon.
In 2017, the program added freshmen advising measures such as “Research at Harvard: A Guide for First-Years,” and lunches at the Office of Career Services, as well as a few social activities, like trivia night. Some students also attend on-campus events thrown by other pre-orientation programs.
Roderick P. Emley’s ’23 first day of FYRE was a blur. Breakfast at 8 a.m., welcome ceremony at 9, then a visit to the Harvard Art Museums. After lunch, Emley headed to a financial literacy workshop. Lectures and panels filled his schedule until dinner, which was an open mic with the theme “Harvard, I Messed Up!” Emley then headed to FYRE Family Time. Every day of FYRE ends with Family Time: “families,” cohorts of 10 students carefully placed together by the steering committee, meet and talk about themselves. In preparation for the school year, they reflect on their pasts, their shared anxieties, and their hopes.
Two years ago, Harvard piloted FYRE as a pre-orientation program targeted at lower-income, first generation students. In 2020, it will return for its third year. Due to University-imposed financial constraints, the program is capped at 100 people — this year, close to 300 applied.
Former FYRE director Sade A. Abraham makes a distinction between the by-the-book definition of first-generation, low-income (FGLI) and the students whom FYRE hopes to help. The traditional definition of first-generation is “if one or more of your parents did not attend a four-year college or university,” and low-income status is determined by the FAFSA ‘Expected Family Contribution’ value. However, she adds, “I think that if you’ve had financial hardship, that’s where we’re very flexible, especially in FYRE, in defining who can be there.”
When Emley left his tiny town in rural New Hampshire for FYRE, the trees were just beginning to turn a deep shade of red. Emley wanted to do a pre-orientation program; coming to Harvard was intimidating. He first considered doing Fall Clean-Up. Then, he reconsidered: How exactly did he want pre-orientation to prepare him for a place like Harvard?
He knew it could be a struggle for people from underrepresented backgrounds to find their community at the school. “There wasn’t a structure in FCU. Like, at the end of the day, FCU is just, like, cleaning dorms.” Obviously, he says, there’s value in that: You get paid and you meet your future peers. Ultimately, though, Emley decided to do FYRE.
At Harvard, open access to the University’s resources does not begin with admission; students must have a background that equips them to navigate the landscape. Emley believed FYRE would give him that access. It seemed like it was “trying to level the playing field, rather than just financially trying to level the playing field.”
Emley was not the only first-year who chose between FCU and FYRE. Some interviewees noted that the applicant pools for the two programs have significant overlap. Many students who might attend FYRE, identifying as first-generation or low-income, are the same students who may see FCU as a financial necessity.
Emley recalls of Fall Clean-Up: “Harvard kind of branded it as, like, ‘Oh, it’s the program for the lower-income student or the first-gen student,’ but I don’t know, cleaning bathrooms should not be that type of program.”
In a statement about Fall Clean-Up’s programming, Miller wrote, “Like all programs and initiatives within the Dean of Students Office, we are committed to assessing and making improvements to these programs on an ongoing basis.”
A small handful of students are able to do a joint program — three days of FCU and then the full three days of FYRE. Abraham explains the rationale behind this: “We realized it was a disservice to the students who had to choose between, like, money and resources. I would not want to make the decision.”
However, only 30 students were accepted to the joint program this year. Alyx J. Britton ’21 and Lisette Leon ’21, the current co-chairs of FYRE, explained why the number was so low.
“Hypothetically, if all 100 of our students decided to do both, and then halfway through the week, Dorm Crew has 100 of its people leave, things are going to be so rough for the people that are still there.” Without this cap on enrollment, there would be an exodus of Fall Clean-Up students leaving for FYRE — a problem for Fall Clean-Up’s labor force.
The question remains: Does Fall Clean-Up meet the needs of first generation, lower-income students who do not do FYRE?
Building resources and advising networks is central to FYRE. In Fall Clean-Up, this is not a focus. “The biggest difference for me,” Jack says, “is that when you do FYRE, your networks also include faculty, staff, and administrators.”
Through FYRE, Murdock was able to “find people and resources to connect with.” He met people who he could turn to when he had questions during the semester. He felt comfortable asking these adults and older students: “Wait, how do I do this?”
Both Fall Clean-Up and FYRE appeal to students from underrepresented backgrounds, but FYRE’s appeal is rooted in shared experiences and an exploration of a common identity. Its intense schedule is catered specifically to first-generation and low-income experiences. In Fall Clean-Up, on the other hand, that type of bonding and supportive infrastructure remains a mostly informal element of the program.
David Cao ’23 was assigned vacuuming as his task for the week of Fall Clean-Up. The equipment was heavy and loud. Cao sweat profusely in the hot dorm rooms, unable to hear his cleaning partner over the combined roar of their vacuums. They got close in other ways, though. “Everyone who’s done vacuuming, like, we just have this common suffering, and so we just bond over that.”
In FYRE, Emley found an affinity group, along with the tools he needed to navigate his identity and enter into the school year.
“I feel like [being first generation, low-income] is a bigger part of my identity now because of FYRE,” Emley reflects. “I started school with that kind of identity, and I’m not sure if, if I hadn’t done FYRE, I would have.”
Is Fall Clean-Up a service to students?
Conwell believes that it is. “Students are providing something to the University. And in return, the University is providing to us, as students.” Conwell is a Dorm Crew captain now — he easily balances his job with the other things he loves, volunteering with the Small Claims Advisory Service and after-school tutoring. In fact, he says, because Dorm Crew is flexible and pays well, the job gives him the autonomy to do what he cares about.
Murdock was jarred when he first got to Harvard; so much about Fall Clean-Up seemed to remind him of his difference from his peers. When he switched to FYRE, he began to “feel less like an outlier.” Still, he is grateful for Fall Clean-Up — the people he met and the money he made. To Murdock, Fall Clean-Up is a “double-edged sword.”
“Nobody wants to speak up and complain super heavily about this opportunity, because it is an opportunity,” he explains. On the other hand, Murdock says, “the fact that that is one of the only jobs that is so readily available, almost forces a lot of people into doing it that wouldn’t otherwise want to do it.”
“You don’t want to say, ‘This is immoral, we should stop having students clean dorm rooms,’ because then what are all the students that are employed by Dorm Crew — what are they going to do then?”
Jack believes Fall Clean-Up reminds some students that they are not members of Harvard’s affluent majority — two-thirds of Harvard students come from the top 20 percent of income in the U.S. Certain freshmen are “brought into this place thinking that they are equals to their peers, but from the very first day, they are reminded that they are not.”

Bound in the weathered covers of three black volumes lie pages upon pages detailing one of Harvard’s hidden gems: A senior thesis with the unassuming title “Direct Action Organizing in the 1970s.” As the dust scatters from the typewritten pages, a story of five women, four advisors, and one vision comes to life.
The year is 1978, and five women gather outside the office of Social Studies department chair Michael Walzer. As they wait, shoes tapping, they discuss the most recent Phillips Brooks House Association meeting and debate strategies for empowering marginalized groups. They are here to write their thesis — together, not alone.
In several meetings like this one, these five women — Adair Dammann ’79, Susan C. Eaton ’79, Sarah E. Royce ’79, Karen R. Scharff ’79, and Stephanie A. Van Dyke ’78 — relentlessly advocated for themselves and their idea of writing the first —and to date, only — group Social Studies thesis in Harvard College history.
Walzer was convinced that they were ruining their academic careers by challenging the norm of thesis-writing based on individual thought and opinion. But the “Gang of Five,” as they came to be known, had no doubt that they made the right choice. After all, they were studying collective political action and saw no better way to do so than to work in a collaborative fashion. Together, the women persisted and finally received departmental approval.
All passionate about activism, the women focused their thesis on comparing the inner workings of the five community organizations where they had respectively interned the previous summer. Each woman then wrote a case study of her respective organization in the thesis after conducting interviews and analyzing data.
Despite their independent work, the process remained highly collaborative. “Everything started in one person’s typewriter and then went through everybody else’s,” says Dammann.
In taking on this project, the women challenged a widely-held definition of intellectual excellence — sitting alone in a library, independently working through one’s thoughts. Instead, the Gang of Five charted a unified path to a coherent and academically rigorous collective thesis.
Working in a group gave the Gang of Five a unique set of advantages. “We got so much more from what we got from talking with each other and from the ability to compare these five different organizations, and nobody writing alone could have had that set of data,” Scharff recalls.
“We intuitively believed we were smarter together than we were individually,” Dammann says. They knew they could achieve their highest level of academic excellence through working collaboratively.
Though still plagued by the perennial problems that all thesis writers experience, the Gang of Five had each other to lean on for support. When Dammann was crippled by writer’s block, her “friends circling up” around her and her sense of responsibility to the rest of the team helped her keep writing. After months of hard work, the Gang of Five turned in their final draft.
But, their story did not end there. The hours they had spent laboring over the one thesis had created an unbreakable bond. To this day, the Gang of Five gathers annually — always making sure that long walks and coffee are part of the agenda — and they regularly consult each other on every aspect of their lives, both professional and personal.
Recently, they realized that they could create a book club using Zoom, a video conferencing app. Chuckling, Dammann admits that the book club is just an excuse to catch up on their lives. “We get on our Zoom call for 90 minutes and we mainly talk about husbands and children and lives and careers, and we talk about the book for 10 minutes.”
In 2003, the Gang of Five faced the death of one of their own, Susan Eaton, who died after a battle with leukemia. To honor her memory and her service to Harvard and the greater community, they rallied classmates together and created the Susan C. Eaton Research Fund in Organizing, Leadership, and Social Change. “It seemed very logical to try and help people, to help Harvard students that were interested in working for social justice and social change,” Royce says. With the grant, they hope to enable students to pursue the work to which Eaton had dedicated her life.
Since graduating college, these five women have stuck together, only growing closer with the passage of time. “We do all major life events with the Gang of Five,” Dammann says. “We are with each other at every step.”
It has been 40 years since the Gang of Five turned in their thesis, and while so much has changed in their own lives and in the world around them, their core belief has not: They are, undoubtedly, better together.

Spend enough time on Harvard’s campus, and you’ll inevitably hear a tour guide compare Harvard to Hogwarts. Maybe they’re pointing out Annenberg’s decor or explaining how freshmen are sorted into Houses.
But “House Elves” take the Harry Potter comparison to a whole new level.
Unlike Dobby, the diminutive supernatural sidekick who pops up to aid Harry’s various missions, Harvard’s house elves are human. Officially known as Faculty Dean’s Aides, “House Elves,” as they are affectionately dubbed, are recent graduates who reside in many of the upperclassmen Houses. Elves receive free meals and board in exchange for their commitment to facilitating various House events. The granularities of the Elf programs vary by House, but the overarching goal of the position in all cases is the same: improving the House community.
Jennifer A. Kunes ’19 is one such Elf living and working in Pforzheimer House. Kunes, who is conducting biomedical engineering research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, says she is perfectly suited to the role. Like the elves of Hogwarts, Kunes is small, by her own calculations, “impish,” and “bubbly.”
Kunes approaches her job with enthusiasm. “I think it’s really fun,” she says. Having Elves “makes the House feel very homey.” In fact, Kunes is so passionate about her job that she decided to change her Instagram handle to ‘Jennie the Elf.’
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, who returned to Quincy last year as an Elf after spending two years on Wall Street, shares a similar impression of his integration into the tight-knit house culture at Harvard. One of his favorite memories of being an Elf was watching the Class of 2019 graduate. Not only was he proud to see students he considered his “mentees” receive their degrees, but he also found the experience a helpful reminder of how privileged he is to remain a part of the Harvard community.
Across the board, translating love for the Harvard community into fun House experiences for the current upperclassmen is a staple of the Faculty Dean’s Aide program.
For instance, Pforzheimer House hosted its annual Halloween Open House Sunday. The Pfoho elves — including Kunes and her co-elf Amanda J.N. Mozea, ’17-’18 — organized, catered, and cooked for the event. Starting a week before the event, the Elves convened to decide the menu, figuring out which items needed to be prepared at home and which should be catered. As of the Thursday before the event, Kunes estimated that she and her colleagues would spend upwards of “12 hours, maybe 15 hours preparing for the open house.” They’ll spend the event “scrambling to make another giant pan of something,” and they won’t leave the Dean’s residence until around 1 a.m., when they’ve finished the clean-up.
But as laborious as this might sound, the Elves feel the result is worth the effort. More than 300 students stopped by to enjoy the gnocchi, candied apples, pumpkin spice lattes, and dozens of other culinary creations.
Biebelberg from Quincy shared the same viewpoint when speaking about last December’s Cookie Open House. “Between the four of us [Elves] and our Faculty Dean, Deb, we baked over 1,500 cookies in total. It was a ton of time and energy, but seeing hundreds of students com[ing] through and picking out cookies that looked good to them and laughing with their friends made the event worthwhile.”
For the Elves, the concepts of food and community are fully intertwined. Elizabeth F. Jacobson ’16, another Elf in Quincy, emphasized her belief that home-cooked food brings people together, partly because of its ability to evoke a connection to family.
Kunes agrees wholeheartedly: “I think it also makes a difference when we really love the food we’re making,” she says, emphasizing the joy of drawing on her own heritage in her cooking. “And it comes across, so even if someone is not thinking, ‘Wow, this is my childhood food,’ they can tell it’s someone’s childhood food, and they get really excited to try.”
Many Elves carry into their job the memories of their own time as students in the Houses, and strive to replicate those positive experiences for today’s undergraduate residents.
In fact, the Elves are so integrated into the House community that they’re often mistaken for students themselves. Mozea explains with amusement that, “A lot of people.. .last year thought that I was a sophomore.”
As a result, she spent a lot of conversations “having to explain that, no, I’m significantly older than you!”

I had planned to dislike Remo, the acting professor whose Chekhov class I took last spring. I had planned to feel this way because all the theater people I knew who took his classes fawned over him in a way that drove me nuts. I often dislike theater people and the theater people liked Remo; ergo, I reasoned, I would not like Remo.
I decided that I would, regrettably, be unable to dislike Remo during the audition for his course. Inside the audition room — a cavernous rehearsal space he occupied alone — I said hello and commented on the absurd number of people waiting outside. Remo said hello back and that yes, he hated having to make choices about who got to be in his class and who didn’t. And then he asked me to deliver the audition monologue.
It was not this interaction that made me like him; people are always saying this kind of thing at Harvard without any particular passion, and I am no longer much affected by its sentiment.
I went to perform the monologue as I had prepared it, standing up with lots of pacing and hand gestures. He told me to sit down at a table across from him, and to say the words simply and with intention. This was not what made me like him either, although it chipped away at my frostiness. It was nice to be expected only to sit and speak simply.
Typically in an audition, while you act, the person you are trying to impress stares at the wall behind you, or at your clothes, and glances every once in a while toward your nose; or else if you are very lucky, the person on the other side of the table will lock eyes with you, except that when they do this they will make the most terrifying facial expression, something between disgust and boredom, and you will wish they had closed their eyes entirely.
In this audition, Remo’s eye contact was steady and inviting. When I said a sad line, he looked sad. When I got to a funny section, he laughed. He responded so normally that I began to suspect I might believe the words I was saying, that they might even be my own.
This was what made me decide to like Remo.
**
When I met Remo (Remo Airaldi ’85, if we’re being picky) for coffee on a recent Wednesday, I found him sitting in the sun, flipping through a giant plastic binder. He explained that he was preparing for a side gig at Dana Farber that required him to impersonate a patient or the relative of a patient so that doctors could practice delivering bad news. The intention of the program, he said, is to train doctors to improve their empathetic skills.
Generally speaking, I believe acting is inherently selfish, and that the only truly unselfish people who like to act are those who also devote themselves to its instruction. Remo — spends hours helping students crack scenes, routinely cries during in-class performances, helps doctors be nice — fits this type.
But when I asked him about the potential for theater to affect anyone outside of the person creating it, he did not immediately start on a discussion about how teaching allows him to give back, as I expected him to.
Instead, he explained that when he began his freshman year at Harvard, his ambitions skewed pre-med. Becoming a doctor would please his parents, neither of whom had attended college. He loved student theater but felt that choosing to act professionally prioritized his own desires over those of his family. Plus, he said, “I wanted to contribute to the world in some way, and does theater do that, really?”
He struggled with the morality of potential careers throughout college, but by graduation, had made up his mind. He auditioned for the American Repertory Theatre’s resident company, where he worked for the next twenty years. Since then, he estimates, he’s performed in at least 120 professional productions, though he’s never added them up.
Ultimately, he decided, there is something inherently generous about the act of performing. He likes to give his students copies of a 2009 interview with the British actress Juliet Stevenson, in which she described a proverbial banner that she imagines might hang in front of theaters, reading “Come to Recognise and be Recognised.”
When we go to the theater, Remo said, “we want to realize that we're not crazy, that other people have gone through or are going through an experience like ours. And the responsibility of reflecting that in a real way, in a truthful way — you know, the good, bad, and the ugly… this idea of sitting around, being told stories. We crave that on some primal, lizard-brain level.”
“So that felt like a nice thing to dedicate my life to.”
Mostly, though, acting as conceived by Remo is not about highfalutin ideals of empathy or dramatic moments of revelation — because these highs are tempered, and quite frankly, overshadowed by moments of challenge, frustration, and failure. Mostly, he thinks, good acting relies on an unflashy ability to trudge forward.
“If you stop to do the math,” he advised me, “and I am not one to do math! — But sometimes I’ll do math — ”
He likes to calculate the following equation: Compare the time spent revelling in the product to the hours of suffering through the process, and the odds are not in your favor. If you act because applause feels good, you won’t be long for this profession, he said. “Because the math doesn’t help you.”
“So I always tell my students: you have to fall in love with the process.”
Making a life out of acting requires that you get comfortable “with this idea of frustration — that that's a fun place to be in — rather than dreading it.”
Success, therefore, is “not some talent… it's just the ability to just, when a million people say no to you, you just keep going, and you just keep going.”
**
Remo sees every production on campus. Before I met him as a professor, I knew him as that man all the other theater kids greeted in the lobby after shows. Put up a play in a freshman dorm basement with two actors, one light, and six chairs, and Remo will fill one of them.
He confessed to me gravely during one Chekhov rehearsal that he was concerned about being able to see a play I was performing in that weekend. He had three other student shows to see, and he didn’t think the timing would line up.
I told him he seriously, seriously, did not need to come; that surely he, having made a life in professional theater, could not glean much enjoyment from the terrible plays we make in our twenties, and that he should give himself a break. He showed up at my Sunday matinee all the same.
One possible explanation for Remo’s attentive theatergoing lies simply in his investment in students. Over our coffee, he described teaching as a practice of shifting attention “off of myself, into you.”
“It’s a wonderful reminder that life is over there. Life is over there and over there where this group of people are going” — he pointed to a pack of students — “that's where life is, not sitting here in my own psychodrama.”
But also, he explained frankly, “I get much more bored at professional theater than I do at student theater.”
“There is this sense of this... energy? I don't know how else to describe it. People are trying things, they're trying to figure themselves out. They don't really know who they are.”
Scant resources beget creative solutions, and with a limited pool of student actors, directors often make unconventional casting decisions. This contrasts sharply with high-budget professional theater, the only occupation in the world in which a person can say with complete impunity that another person does not look the right way to book a job.
In his classes, Remo is known for casting scenes ‘against type,’ meaning characters that fulfill tropes — romantic lead, funny sidekick — need not be portrayed by an actor with the specific physical or behavioral characteristics we typically ascribe to such stereotypes.
He delegates roles according to this philosophy because he sees the classroom as a “laboratory” that, like college theater, has low enough stakes to allow for creative liberties.
But he also approaches his responsibilities as a teacher from his experiences acting.
“I'm not going to be the romantic lead,” he joked. “I've never been the romantic lead in anything in my life.” This is a reality he is resigned to. I objected: Typecasting seemed to me a symptom of the theater industry’s chronically underdeveloped imagination. “Everyone falls in love!” I said.
“Exactly,” he agreed. “Right. Within whatever limits of the character that you play, you can bring that aspect out, right?” For example, in a character that is coldly paternal, gruff and unyielding, “I will try to find the opposite of that on some level, which is a softness… a Romeo inside.”
This affinity for nuance reminded me of something he had said to my acting class before I performed in a scene as Natasha, the widely accepted villain of “Three Sisters.” Natasha is manipulative and greedy, increasingly cruel as she accumulates power, easy to hate. But as the rest of the class waited for my scene partner and I to set up our rudimentary set, Remo reminded them that Natasha has the only protagonist’s arc in the plot. She begins the play with very little and through sheer will, ends up with quite a lot. The sisters hurt her; she fights back and she wins. She is not a winner but she wins anyway. Perhaps there is something to admire in her grit, he said.
Remo’s cultish appeal among Harvard theater kids, I think, comes not simply from the fact that he approaches characters and students alike with the generosity he allowed Natasha, treating both as complex entities meriting empathy and respect. We like Remo because he affords us this compassion in the face of the deeply unpleasant requirements of standing in front of a group of people and pretending to be a person that you are not.
Remo is frank about this, the painful reckoning that acting can require: a kind of “taking inventory of yourself and embracing every part of you and being willing to share that.” Because “the more areas of your life that you go, ‘no, no, no,’ the less successful you're gonna be as an actor. You can't have a bunch of parts of you that are off limits.”
He embraces this ruthless vulnerability and says: This discomfort is a good thing, and it can become fulfilling and generative. If you do it right, perhaps it can even bring you joy.
**
“Uncle Vanya,” Chekhov’s last and most intimate play, ends with a monologue delivered by Sonia, the longsuffering niece of the titular character.
In the monologue, Sonia, who is herself mourning unrequited love and facing down the strong likelihood that the rest of her life will contain limited joy, tries to comfort her suicidal uncle.
“It’s so difficult for me,” Vanya says to her. “If only you knew how difficult it is!”
“What can we do?” she asks in response. “We’ll live. We’ll live.” We will live and we will suffer and most of the living will in fact be suffering, she says. And then, when all that is finished, many, many years from now, “we’ll smile and look back tenderly at our past unhappiness. And we’ll rest.”
When I prepared this monologue for performance on the last day of class, Remo and I spent a while mulling over the last line. In Annie Baker’s translation, the version we used primarily in the course, the text reads simply: “We’ll rest… / We’ll rest! / We’ll rest.” But in another translation Remo uncovered on his bookshelf — he liked to comb through alternative translations for fun, bouncing into rehearsals with different options he’d found for us to try — that final sentence reads: “I know we’ll rest.”
The crucial difference lay in our decision about whether to include these two extra words. Is the monologue aspirational? If so, the Baker translation seemed to aptly make space for the potential that Sonia’s vision might not manifest after all. Or is the monologue an affirmation of a truth Sonia is convinced of, the certainty that misery yields reward, that there is some redeeming beauty innate in suffering?
We decided it was the latter.
In my copy of the script, I have scrawled a note; something Remo said while coaching me through the monologue, around the time when the message of the speech and the pedagogical act of delivering it had begun to blur.
“Don’t let anyone make you cynical about the work,” my sloppy handwriting reads. “You have to be able to endure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scientists have settled a long-standing debate about how viruses assemble, according to a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Sept. 30.
Chemical Engineering and Physics Professor Vinothan N. Manoharan led the small team — comprising Applied Physics research associate Rees F. Garmann and former Applied Physics graduate student Aaron M. Goldfain — working on the project.
The specific virus they examined consists of an RNA strand of about 3600 nucleotides, bounded by a protective capsule — known as a capsid — of 180 proteins, according to Manoharan.
Manoharan and Garmann said the team sought to settle a debate between two theories of viral assembly. The first theory — called the “en masse” pathway — posits that most of the requisite proteins glom onto to the RNA in a disordered way, and then subsequently sort themselves into a capsid. The second theory — termed the nucleation and growth model — suggests that a few proteins drift onto and off from the RNA molecule, at some point forming a critical mass — or nucleus — from which the capsid proceeds to grow rapidly.
Manoharan added that past experimentation has not been able to resolve the question.
“People had done experiments looking at many viruses assembling at the same time, and kind of averaging over all of that data. But that doesn't give you enough information to see which of these pathways actually is actually working,” he said.
Manoharan said that his team harnessed the ultra-sensitive technique of interferic scattering microscopy in order to see the tiny individual viruses — which span only 30 nanometers in diameter.
What the team saw, he added, supports the nucleation and growth model for small RNA viruses.
“It could take minutes before the nucleus forms — the nucleus is the cluster of proteins on the RNA. But then once that nucleus forms, the virus grows in a matter of seconds,” he said.
Manoharan added that the team made one further observation — namely, that a high protein concentration can induce multiple protein nuclei to form on the RNA, creating multiple shells that fail to merge together.
“If you get more than one nucleus forming on the RNA before the assembly is complete, you end up with these monster structures, which are imperfect and wouldn’t serve the virus very well,” Garmann said.
Manoharan said this observation has a potential clinical upshot.
“It suggests that one way to disrupt viral assembly might actually be to increase the rate at which these nuclei are forming, which is a bit counterintuitive, because it would correspond to increasing the amount of viral protein that's inside your system,” he said.
Garmann said he spots new questions on the horizon.
“How does the RNA affect the nucleation process? How does it either promote or facilitate it?” he asked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of an August petition calling on the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 to donate funds connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Hasty Pudding announced a $50,000 donation to an anti-sex trafficking nonprofit Monday.
Undergraduates in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which falls under the Institute, organized a petition calling on its graduate board to donate money connected with Epstein to a charity that combats sex trafficking. Dozens of women have accused Epstein, a billionaire investor, of sexually assaulting them when they were children.
The Epstein-linked charity Gratitude America, Ltd. donated $50,000 to the Hasty Pudding Institute in 2016, according to tax filings; Epstein served as president of Gratitude America in 2014. The August petition called on the graduate board to donate an equal amount to charity.
Hasty Pudding Institute spokesperson Guan-Yue Chen ’17 and Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Elias W. “Eli” Russell ’20 did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether Epstein-related pushback prompted the Monday announcement.
Still, the Pudding’s donation satisfies the request outlined by the petition. The organization gave funds to Girls Educational and Mentoring Services, a group that supports underage and young adult victims of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation.
“It is impossible to overstate the import and efficacy of the work that [GEMS President] Rachel Lloyd and GEMS does for horrifically exploited young woman. GEMS is, in many ways, unique in its mission and its success stories,” Hasty Pudding Institute President Andrew L. Farkas ’82 said in a press release announcing the donation.
The Hasty Pudding’s announcement came less than two weeks after The Crimson reported on the petition and other internal efforts to push the organization toward donating the Epstein-linked funds.
The Monday press release also briefly noted other donations the Institute made this year, including gifts to the Arthur Miller Foundation and the Maestro Cares Foundation.
The Hasty Pudding Institute previously named Epstein one of its major donors. The organization’s website listed him among donors contributing over $50,000 in 2018 as recently as April 2019. Epstein is not on the roster of 2019 donors.
In August, current members and alumni of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals questioned the decision to keep the funds associated with Epstein, who faced charges for crimes including sex trafficking of minors.
Epstein died in an apparent suicide in a Manhattan jail cell last month awaiting his trial for those charges.
A November 2018 report by the Miami Herald identified roughly 80 women who allege Epstein sexually abused them between 2001 and 2006 and uncovered a sex ring Epstein operated out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home.
Prosecutors first convicted Epstein in 2008 on charges related to the solicitation of an underage prostitute. He served only 13 months in prison for those charges, however, with a generous work release allowance.
Epstein was again indicted in July 2019 on one count of sex trafficking of a minor and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.
Harvard has announced it will donate funds remaining from gifts Epstein made to the University to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote last month that Harvard would donate an unspent balance of $186,000 in gifts from Epstein and conduct a review into the University’s connections to Epstein. Bacow also wrote that records revealed the University received $8.9 million in donations from Epstein between 1998 and 2007.
Harvard’s Office of the General Counsel is conducting the review. Bacow said in a Monday interview that the University hired an outside firm to assist its lawyers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former United States presidential candidate Ralph Nader urged Harvard Law School students to enter public interest legal careers at a lunchtime event Wednesday.
Around 100 people, including both Harvard affiliates and members of the public, attended the event hosted by the Harvard Law Record — the Law School’s independent student-run newspaper. Nader, who graduated from the Law School in 1958, was a member of the paper’s staff while attending the Law School.
In his remarks, Nader urged current students to pursue public interest law over jobs in corporate law. Historically, Harvard Law graduates have overwhelmingly gravitated toward the private sector though the school has pursued initiatives to encourage students to enter the public sector.
“This is a law school of huge talent,” Nader. “We’re in a major constitutional crisis, the likes of which this country has never seen.”
Nader said there is a pressing need for more public interest lawyers in today’s political climate. Nader has run for president of the United States four times in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. In 2000, he was the Green Party nominee and received 2.7 percent of the national vote.
Nader also spoke about national politics and called U.S. President Donald Trump the “most impeachable president of all time.”
“Lawlessness is the norm when it comes to the rich and powerful, which is why when you come to this law school you should have a choice,” Nader said. “Do you want to be a traditional lawyer who draft contracts, deeds, and represents corporations or do you want to focus on lawlessness, which is the norm?”
Roughly halfway through his speech, Nader asked the audience how many of its members were first-year law students. A handful of audience members raised their hands. He then asked how many were second- and third-year law students. Almost no one raised their hands.
“See what I mean?” Nader said in response. “See what happens to you? You come in idealistic, and then you get processed. It happens all over the country.”
Vincent R. Parascandolo, a first-year student at the Law School, said he attended the talk because he has appreciated Nader’s work in consumer advocacy and considers him a “fighter for justice.”
“I think he makes a good point that we would be best served by using our time here to look beyond the narrow technicalities of the law just for commercial purposes and look to, really, what it means to be an officer of the court and pursue justice,” Parascandolo said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday an external law firm is assisting the Office of the General Counsel in their review of donations made to Harvard by billionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.
Bacow announced in an email to Harvard affiliates last month that the University would review Epstein’s donations, writing that his connections to the school “raise important concerns.” Just over a week after Bacow’s announcement, Vice President and General Counsel Diane E. Lopez disclosed that the Office of the General Counsel would be conducting the review in an email to Harvard affiliates.
Bacow said Monday he made the decision to have the Office of the General Counsel conduct the review. The University also hired Boston-based law firm Foley Hoag to aid in the process.
Bacow said that including external counsel in this review was the proper route to take for this investigation.
“It seemed like the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances to ensure that people felt comfortable talking,” Bacow said.
Harvard has retained Foley Hoag to conduct external investigations prior to the Epstein investigation. In 2013, the University commissioned a lawyer from the firm to review an internal investigation into whether Harvard had authorized secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts.
“It’s one of the more prominent firms in Boston,” Bacow said Monday. “It’s well regarded.”
Epstein had long-standing ties to Harvard, donating nearly $9 million to the University between 1998 and 2007 — including a $6.5 million gift to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. Bacow wrote in his email last month that most of the money Epstein gave to Harvard has been spent, but an unused portion totalling $186,000 would be given to organizations that support victims of both human trafficking and sexual assault.
The billionaire and convicted sex offender died by suicide in August and faced multiple allegations of sexually abusing underage girls. The Miami Herald reported Epstein operated a sex ring out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home for years.
Roughly 80 women said Epstein molested or sexually abused them before 2006, according to the Herald. Epstein only spent 13 months in a county jail after federal prosecutors arranged an extraordinary plea deal. The 2008 prosecution was led by former United States Secretary of Labor R. Alexander Acosta ’90, who resigned after federal prosecutors in New York opened a new investigation into Epstein.
In Monday’s interview, Bacow said the University is investigating Epstein’s financial ties to ensure they have a “good handle” on the donations he has given.
“We think we understand what he’s given directly and the timing of those gifts,” Bacow said. “There were allegations and representations by some that he may have directed gifts from others. We're trying to understand if that happened.”
Bacow said he did not have a timeline for the investigation but that it will “last as long as it needs to.”
“We want to make sure that it's done thoroughly and correctly,” Bacow said. “I'm not going to put a limit on the timing.”
Bacow also declined to commit the University to releasing the results of the review after it is completed.
“I don’t know what the results of the review will be,” Bacow said. “We’ll make that decision when the time comes.”

The Office of the President and the University’s Office for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging officially launched a joint initiative called the Harvard Culture Lab Innovation Fund to promote diversity and inclusion, the University announced in an email Wednesday.
The fund will award competitive grants up to $15,000 or more to pilot and scale ideas that address and solve critical challenges regarding diversity and inclusion at Harvard.
The initiative is now accepting project applications through the beginning of December from teams of Harvard students, staff, faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and academic personnel. The selection process includes a written application followed by a pitch competition.
“We’re going to try to tap into not the entrepreneurial spirit that is tied to personal wealth, but the entrepreneurial spirit at Harvard that is tied to a kind of common wealth — the campus culture and the sense of community that we have here,” John S. Wilson Jr., senior advisor and strategist to Harvard’s president, said in an interview.
The theme of the 2019-2020 funding cycle is “Advancing Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging through Technology Driven Solutions.” The fund is soliciting ideas that leverage technology to “strengthen and advance” Harvard’s culture of belonging, according to the email.
“This Harvard Culture Lab is going to make us proactive,” Wilson said. “Most of the offices of this type are reactive, responding to crises and conflicts all over the campus.”
This past spring, the fund awarded its initial pilot grants — given in advance of the fund’s official release this Wednesday — to projects ranging from web-based platforms to assessment tools, awareness campaigns, and events.
For example, the “This is How You Say My Name” project — one of the spring 2019 pilot grant recipients — integrated name recording into my.harvard, providing faculty, teaching assistants, and advisors the opportunity to hear the correct pronunciation of students’ names prior to engaging with them.
“This project really captured just what’s possible when it comes to leveraging technology to promote belonging and inclusion,” Jainaba M. Seckan, project manager at the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, said.
Wilson said the fund was born out of the framework recommended by the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, which former University President Drew G. Faust convened in 2016.
Over the course of two years, the 55-member University-wide task force — comprising professors, staff, and alumni — evaluated Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and recommended improvements.
In March 2018, the task force released its final report. Its recommendations included enhancing mental health resources, improving faculty recruitment and retention strategies, and building two University-wide centers — one for “identity, politics, and culture” and one for “inclusion and belonging.”
Since the report, the task force has also conducted a pilot “Pulse Survey” — the largest survey ever conducted in the history of Harvard. Around 24,000 University affiliates participated in the “Pulse Survey,” according to Wilson.
Wilson said despite potential financial limitations, the fund’s ultimate goal is to promote innovation and better the campus culture.
“We're not going to be constrained by the funds,” he said. “The bottom line is the culture. We're looking to improve the Harvard University culture and make it reflect one of sustainable inclusive excellence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long-running Harvard-funded efforts to build and renovate pedestrian crossings over Soldiers Field Road in Allston have fallen behind their scheduling projections.
Harvard first committed $3.5 million in 2014 to build pedestrian and bicycle crossings in Allston. The planned footpaths are intended to increase accessibility between the Charles River parklands and the neighborhoods.
The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation announced at a public meeting in November 2018 that final design plans for the project would be completed in spring 2019, and construction on the footpaths was slotted to begin in 2019. The designs of the crossways, however, are currently at only 25 percent completion, DCR spokesperson Olivia K. Dorrance wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
In addition to the DCR, the University has partnered with the Boston Planning and Development Agency and the City of Boston to plan and complete the project.
To date, the DCR has focused designs on building a crossing at Everett Street and renovating an existing footbridge at Telford Street, though additional sites may be considered if funding permits, according to Gerald Autler, senior project manager of the BPDA.
Autler said Tuesday that plans for the project have centered on the Everett Street development following stalled conversations about how to execute the Telford Street construction.
“The decision was made that they should focus on Everett Street,” Autler said. “The reason for that was that there was just a real difference in opinion among different segments among the community about the proper approach to Telford Street crossing.”
After the Everett Street construction finishes, Autler said he anticipates that the discussion surrounding Telford Street will come more into focus. He added that it will be important to evaluate how to best use Harvard’s monetary contribution.
“Once we’ve made headway on working with DCR to get the Everett Street crossing done, the next thing we'll want to reopen that conversation and determine what the most effective way of using the Harvard contribution is and raising additional funds if necessary to complete you know one or both of those crossings,” Autler said.
Some Allston residents said they are disappointed by the delay of construction.
“Making it safer to walk and bike from Allston to the Charles River has been a neighborhood priority for years and years,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said. “There was, I’d say, a lot of enthusiasm for Harvard sharing that interest and it’s just very sad that years after Harvard pledged that money to make it happen that it still feels like we’re at square one.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke reaffirmed Harvard’s commitment to the project in an emailed statement Monday. She did not comment on the timeline delays.
“Harvard is proud of its $3.5 million commitment to helping support safe pedestrian access to the Charles River, and looks forward to the project moving forward,” O’Rourke wrote.
Autler said though BPDA is a collaborator in the crossings project, the scheduling milestones are set by DCR.
“We’re very much a partner in helping them get this done, but it’s a DCR project, not a BPDA project,” Autler said. “Ultimately, they’re the ones who kind of are deciding about the time frame.”
Since 2017, DCR has organized multiple public meetings to gather input for the design and construction of the crossways. Dorrance wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the DCR invites the public to share their perspectives in an open comment period after each meeting.
“DCR recognizes the importance of public input in parks projects and takes pride in listening to stakeholder concerns and addressing them through revised design plans,” Dorrance wrote. “The agency received approximately 100 comments regarding the improvement project, which DCR has reviewed.”
The DCR plans to host an additional public meeting in the coming months to gather more input from Allston residents and present more design ideas, according to Dorrance.

“I think [it’s] a good thing, that what you study does not necessarily have to be what you do for your career,” said Jon Morosi ‘04, former Crimson men's hockey beat writer and junior varsity baseball player for Harvard. “[My parents] very easily could have said, ‘You know, Jon, we didn’t send you to Harvard to be a baseball writer.’”
Morosi graduated Harvard in 2004 with a degree in environmental science and public policy, but has worked in sports journalism and broadcasting ever since his time at Harvard.
“I wouldn’t trade my experience [as a college journalist] for anything,” he said.
The former Crimson editor was a beat writer for the Tigers with the Detroit Free Press from 2006-2009, before joining FOXSports.com as a national baseball writer and columnist. Now, he works at MLB Network, appearing on numerous programs, including the Emmy-award winning MLB Tonight, while also having the chance to cover for NHL Network at times. He resides in his home state of Michigan with his wife and three daughters.
As part of his work study in his first year on campus, Morosi worked in the athletic media relations department, keeping stat sheets at the hockey games. Then, Mike Volonnino ‘01, senior beat writer for men’s hockey at the time, told Jon he should write for the Crimson and cover hockey the following year. Once Volonnino graduated, Morosi took over the open beat his sophomore year (also doing play-by-play on WHRB broadcasts), following the hockey team throughout the winter until the season ended and he took the field for the baseball team.
The highlight of Morosi’s years covering the Crimson’s time on the ice? In March of 2002, Morosi sat and watched sophomore Tyler Kolarik ‘04 bury the puck in the third overtime of the longest championship game in ECAC history (96:11) to secure the 4-3 triumph over Cornell.
“One of the great parts of it too,” Morosi reflected, “is that when you when you...cover a team that's meaningful to you, and then they do something special, there's a really great amount of gratitude in that, and I think that's totally great.”
Among the many thrills of covering professional baseball, Morosi’s favorite might be the World Baseball Classic.
“I think that anybody that knows me and has talked to me about international baseball realizes that I probably say we should have it every single year,” said Morosi. “I love it that much…I'm already getting very excited about 2021.” Morosi said the noise from the 2017 WBC games in Miami left his ears ringing from the time he left the stadium at night to the time he returned the next day. It’s a phenomenon, like the World Cup, “where the fans are not there to see the show—they believe they are the show,” explained Morosi. “That makes for really special sporting events.”
When asked about baseball’s return to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Morosi expressed his excitement for baseball to grow on the world stage. The Olympics provides opportunities “for the sport to grow around the world, in places where it hasn't necessarily traditionally been strong," and you wonder how many dreams will be inspired by young people watching their national team participate.
Morosi acknowledges the difficulty and sometimes volatility of the journalism industry.
“I basically decided around [sophomore year] that I was going to do this until someone told me that I couldn’t,” he said. “And it hasn’t happened yet...It's a funny business, you never know when you get the tap on the shoulder that says ‘Hey, it's time to do something else.’ There's always that possibility out there, because it’s such a competitive and talent driven industry.” In other words, you have to do your homework, and it surely helps to be so passionate about what you cover.
Morosi sees several parallels to Harvard in his profession.
“Your job is to is to comprehensively inform yourself every day on something that you have a very keen interest, “ said Morosi. “That is at its core, still a very academic and intellectual pursuit, whether it's for television... the internet...a newspaper, a magazine, radio—it's still trying to become an expert...by learning new things every day. And that actually, when you think about Harvard's educational mission, lines up pretty nicely.”
For Morosi, interacting with players also incorporates an academic pursuit, considering Morosi learned better Spanish throughout his professional career in order to connect with players more closely.
In September of 2019, “I was in the Mets clubhouse and Robinson Cano called me over,” said Morosi. “Then he just started speaking to me in Spanish. And he was smiling because we've talked before, and he really enjoyed the fact that I did—I've made this effort to speak Spanish.” Despite the benefit of Morosi’s linguistic skills, his one regret was that he didn’t take more Spanish at Harvard.
It’s important to Morosi to connect with players and he enjoys telling the stories of where players have come from and how they’ve emerged as unique performers in such a competitive, talent-driven industry.
“I think in journalism, yes, objectivity is a big part of our jobs,” Jon iterated on the phone. “But humanity is too, and we can't lose that authenticity of who we are... there's a human element in sports, [and] there's a human element in journalism too.”
Since writing for the Crimson, Morosi has provided that human element, whether it be behind the microphone, behind the keyboard, or in front of the camera. He reflected, “I would say that I just feel very, very lucky that I still somehow get paid to talk to people about something I love.” Considering Jon Morosi has made it this far without anyone telling him to stop—and it’s worked out this well—we don’t see him stopping any time soon. Now it’s playoff baseball season. You’re excited, we’re excited, Jon’s excited, and you’ll see him on MLB Network.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football is for everyone. Are we the only country in the world that places such a unique emphasis on the sport? Sure. But it’s still for everyone. People of all different backgrounds, views, and opinions can come together in harmony in the company of a good ole game of football.
Devoted Twitter-goers, such as myself, probably know where I’m headed with this one. This past weekend, while the Dallas Cowboys failed to show up for their matchup against the Green Bay Packers, over 93,000 people showed up to the state-of-the-art AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Most of these fans would leave with the very Cowboys-familiar feeling of frustration and disappointment, customary for big games involving the Cowboys. I was not alone when a certain segment of the Fox broadcast left me laughing on my couch.
In honoring a wonderful new Medal of Honor Museum accompanying the new Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, multiple important people who made the museum happened were pictured on the field before the game, among them former President George W. Bush, a part-owner of the Rangers. When the broadcast went live, President Bush was pictured in Jerry Jones’ owner’s box laughing next to none other than Ellen Degeneres. Many fans cried out against Ellen for “befriending” President Bush due to their clear disagreement on politics. Ellen defended her friendship on her show, saying that disagreements should not pit people against one another in this country.
I stand with Ellen. Everyone should do their best to understand everyone else. And there is no better outlet for such human bonding than football. So with that, I ready for the next installment of one of our most admirable aspects of culture and bonding: football.
LAFAYETTE VS. PRINCETON
For the third straight week, an Ivy League football game will be televised on a national ESPN network on Friday night. This matchup, however, is the first non-conference game to take up that mantle. You can thank nationally ranked Princeton for that one. In its last non-conference game, the Tigers are hoping to stay undefeated heading into Ancient Eight play. To be totally honest, each week I write one of these things and talk about how it’s been even longer since Princeton has lost. At this point I can’t even remember when it was. But it’s been at least since 2017. I doubt that ends this week.
Princeton by 28.
HOLY CROSS VS. BROWN
This week, Brown waived the GRE test for 24 of its graduate programs. I was shocked when I heard this. Not because Brown removed this requirement, but because it meant that before this moment, Brown did require the GRE for these graduate programs. I am surprised that standardized testing had any place on a campus with absolutely 0 (zero) General Education requirements. While it may seem that I’m still poking fun at our neighbors from Rhode Island, I say this past sentence out of envy. I wish that General Education was not so intertwined with a liberal arts education. Those SLS 20 midterms were cruel and unusual. I wish we had the flexibility of Brown’s General Education requirements. Unfortunately, the Bears’ defense is even more flexible than their curriculum.
Holy Cross by 14.
SACRED HEART VS. PENNSYLVANIA
All four of the Ivy League teams playing out of conference this week get to do so at home. This is good news for the conference. Tough to say if this is good news for Sacred Heart. Philadelphia proves a peculiar place, both culturally and academically. This week, one of Penn’s peer institutions from downtown Philly was caught in the middle of a news story that definitely counts as bad press. An engineering professor was caught having spent over $190,000 of federal academic grants on personal costs, most notably on strip clubs. I’m sure he’s very busy writing the engineering paper related to these costs, so I won’t dwell on the story.
Penn by 7.
CENTRAL CONNECTICUT VS. COLUMBIA
I’m not really sure what constitutes central Connecticut, I’m guessing it means not touching New York. If that’s the case, the Blue Devils will be forced to take the bus instead of the train to the Lions’ concrete jungle territory. In my first ATI of the semester, I said that Columbia had turned around its recent history in the cellar of the Ivy League. It is with a heavy heart that I admit this was short-lived. This past week, the New York Knicks conducted an open gym practice at Columbia University. I don’t think I have to explain why this means that Columbia may have some trouble winning from this point on. Let’s hope that the Knicks only rub off on the basketball team.
Columbia by 17.
YALE AT DARTMOUTH
Consider this matchup lucky. Yes, we’re super early in the year. But this contest has some major conference implications. Both teams are undefeated, and Yale started the year picked as the Ivy League favorite thanks to its returning 21 of 22 starters that I can’t stop gushing about. Dartmouth and its Big Green Defensive MachineTM, however, has looked fantastic going back to last season. Its championship hopes were dashed in a similarly undefeated matchup with Princeton last season. Both squads will be taking this early October game with the importance of the last game of the season.
This matchup, while early, has major implications. There’s a reason that this game isn’t slotted into the normal 1:00 P.M. start time for most Ancient Eight football games. It fully deserves the Ivy League primetime spot at 1:30 P.M. that it earned.
Dartmouth by 4.
CORNELL VS. HARVARD
I really want to talk about this game, I do. I really want to talk about how, in the past two years, Cornell has topped Harvard by a combined seven points. I really want to point out that these games, while not expected to be particularly or especially exciting, turned into enthralling barnburners. I really want to talk about how the Crimson, for two straight years, has had some ineffable struggle in close games against its Big Red rivals. I would love to talk about these things. However, there is something much, much more important to address that transcends the game of football.
Last week, some of the most exciting news in the history of the area came out of Ithaca. On October 3, the Cornell Daily Sun excitedly reported that Ithaca, New York, was ranked as the very top car-free city in the nation as apart of the “very small metro” category. I know, I’m not sure why I didn’t see it in the New York Times either. I’m proud of you, Ithaca. This major accomplishment will not be overlooked. I was going to take an easy cheap shot at Ithaca, but not this week. Not in the midst of its finest moment.
Unfortunately for Cornell, this week’s game is not in Ithaca. It’ll be played in a place that sadly did not win the “very small metro” category for top car-free cities: on Harvard’s campus.

Whether you’re a new Quadling or a hardened shuttle veteran, there comes a time when every Quad resident has to decide whether or not to walk to class. Your friend tells you that not only is the walk refreshing and a wonderful time of solitude and reflection, it encourages her to wake up early! You don’t believe her, but you think you should try it out — maybe.
I am that friend. I have walked to my classes in flash flood thunderstorms, blizzards, and sweltering heat, even in uncomfortable shoes. As a self-proclaimed expert in walking from the Quad, let me explain how I do what I do.
Let’s lay out the specifics first. Here is a step-by-step guide on the fastest way to walk to the Yard (entry point: Johnson Gate) from the Quad (exit point: in front of the Student Organization Center at Hilles), during daylight hours. I can only guarantee it is the fastest route for that distance. (You can also follow this route and cut through the Yard to the Harvard Art Museums and the Barker Center.)
Step 1: Walk to the SOCH
Or, more specifically, walk to the corner of Shepard Street and Garden Street. Personally, I would not recommend going down Mass. Ave. to the Yard.
Step 2: Go Down Garden Street and into Cambridge Common
This part is crucial. Do not cross the road. The fastest Garden St. light is a hidden gem that you can and should use in your daily walk.
Step 3: Enjoy the Common!
This too is crucial. It’s a park! Take in the trees! But please walk in a straight line if you’re listening to music, or a cyclist might take you out.
Step 4: Cross Garden Street at the Intersection with Appian Way
The light is right past the Radcliffe Yard and is the key to this whole route. You’re not just walking through Cambridge Common because it’s green and nice. You’re not even walking to the Yard. You’re actually walking to this light because it’s the best light in all of Cambridge. Press the button to cross (bear with me) and watch it change in literally five seconds. Revel in your power. Cross the street.
Step 5: Cross Mass. Ave via General MacArthur Square
That’s the little island with the public restroom booth. This crossing too is pretty legit, even if the first half can be tedious — the light at the second Mass. Ave lane doesn’t change for around 15 seconds after the cross signal goes red, so you can safely get to the other side even if you catch the tail end of the walk symbol.
Step 6: Enter Johnston Gate! You made it!
Except don’t enter the big gate, because of the whole you-won’t-graduate superstition. Take no chances. Now, cut through the Yard, and get to your classroom feeling energized and counting those steps.
Note: This route is not necessarily reversible, and I especially would not recommend it at nighttime because there are no blue emergency lights along the way. If you’re traveling at night, check out our after dark route.
