After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a resolution passed last month, Cambridge’s City Council publicly denounced the right-wing media organization Breitbart.com for spreading what it called “anti-Muslim libel” after the outlet published an article asserting that a City councillor has ties to the Islamic militant group Hamas.
Breitbart’s November article, entitled “Hamas on the Charles,” claims that City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen is connected to Hamas through his work as a founding director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy organization.
The council’s December 7 resolution, proposed by Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, characterized Breitbart as an “illegitimate tabloid” that should be disregarded.
“Breitbart.com has a history of outrageous and sensationalized journalism designed for shock value but which has no proven basis in truth whatsoever,” the resolution reads.
Mazen, who was first elected to the Council in 2013 and was re-elected as the top vote recipient in 2015, has sought to refute many of the article’s claims.
“We’re speaking out against something that is inherently bad journalism and unbelievable in a very real and literal sense,” Mazen said.
Sam Westrop, one of the authors of the Breitbart article, said he does not believe his article is libelous.
“For it to be libel, something would have to be untrue and unfortunately everything we’ve written is true,” said Westrop, who is the research director of Americans for Peace and Tolerance, a group that frequently criticizes Islamist extremism. “This unprecedented attack on media criticism of a public official is highly unusual.”
In response to the December resolution, Breitbart published a second article written by another author titled “War: Cambridge, Massachusetts City Council Censures Breitbart News.” The article claims the resolution is an “affront to the First Amendment” and defends the site’s original story as factual.
Mark V. Tushnet ’67, a Harvard Law School professor specializing in constitutional law, wrote in an email that he “doubt[s] that the city council's resolution could be fairly called even an affront to First Amendment values.” Mazen also said he does not believe the resolution is a “free speech matter”;  nor does Westrop, who said “no one has removed the article or stopped us from speaking.”
John E. Robbins, Executive Director of the Massachusetts branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the article was worrisome to the group, of which Mazen is a member.
“If anything, the article is really demonstrative and emblematic of how those who perpetuate Islamophobia specifically and decisively try to smear or disrupt the work of Muslims who are doing things in the public sphere that would otherwise seem anodyne,” Robbins said, citing Mazen’s work creating affordable housing for low-income residents in Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals announced Wednesday that actress Kerry Washington, known for her starring role on ABC’s political drama “Scandal,” will be honored later this month as the organization’s 2016 Woman of the Year.
In her role as a crisis management expert to politicians on “Scandal,” Washington has received Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. When the show first aired in 2012, Washington became the first African-American woman lead in an American network drama in nearly 40 years.
According to a press release from the organization, Washington will be feted on January 28 with a parade in the afternoon hosted by Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a Harvard-based musical comedy troupe. A celebratory roast will follow the parade, and finally, Washington will receive the group’s signature “Pudding Pot” award in Farkas Hall, where the organization stages its spring show.
Kennedy F. Q. Edmonds ’17, one of the producers of the 168th executive board, said in a press release the organization is excited to welcome Washington to Cambridge and celebrate her achievements, noting that the group may feel “a bit nervous as we set out to coordinate a perfect event for legendary PR whiz Olivia Pope,” the character Washington plays on “Scandal.”
“Kerry is an amazing actress with many fans in the company, and the perfect choice for this honor,” Edmonds said in the press release.
The organization’s Woman of the Year award, first established in 1951 to recognize women entertainers, was awarded to actress and comedian Amy Poehler last year. Previous award recipients include Helen Mirren, Marion Cotillard, and Julia Roberts, among others. According to the press release, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals will name 2016’s Man of the Year, who will be honored February 5, at a later date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of 15 professors from the Yard to Longwood has begun searching for the replacement of Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier, who will step down from his post in July.
The search commences roughly two months after Flier announced he would conclude his nine-year tenure as dean to take a sabbatical year and return to the school as a faculty member.
The new dean will inherit Flier’s leadership role in the Medical School’s ongoing capital campaign, which as of October had raised more than $467 million toward its goal of $750 million. Under Flier, the Medical School also rolled out a new curriculum, integrating multiple disciplines into single courses and emphasizing the flipped classroom model; the new dean will continue Flier’s academic overhaul.
In an email sent to Medical School affiliates Wednesday, University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who will oversee the search, also welcomed confidential input and nominations for the next dean from students, faculty, and staff.
“We would especially encourage observations about the principal opportunities and challenges facing Harvard Medical School, on the professional and personal attributes you regard as most important to seek in the next dean, and on particular individuals you believe would warrant serious consideration for the deanship,” they wrote.
A plurality of the search committee are primarily affiliated with the Medical School, though the committee also includes faculty members affiliated with the Dental School, the School of Public Health, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III is also a member of the search committee.
Longwood also awaits the appointment of a new dean for the School of Public Health after former dean Julio Frenk departed before the beginning of the fall term to become president of the University of Miami.
The committee members, in alphabetical order, are: HMS professor Katrina A. Armstrong, HMS professor Stephen C. Blacklow, HMS professor Emery N. Brown, HMS professor Constance L. Cepko, SEAS dean Francis J. Doyle III, HMS associate professor Levi A. Garraway, HMS professor Galit Lahav, HMS professor Joseph Loscalzo, HMS professor Barbara J. McNeil, Dental School professor Vicki Rosen, School of Public Health professor Eric Rubin, HMS professor Bernardo Sabatini, FAS professor Alexander F. Schier, HMS professor Arlene Sharpe, and HMS professor Vikas P. Sukhatme.
