After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate, thousands of town-hall meetings across the country, countless days of blockading through various Congressional rules and regulations, and preliminary passage in both chambers of Congress, it is high time for our members of Congress to pass comprehensive health-care reform. Yet it seems that partisan tactics will forever stymie any real reform.  Therefore, we believe it was appropriate for President Obama last week to indirectly call on Congress to invoke reconciliation, a budget procedure that allows for a simple-majority vote to overcome fiscal differences in the House and Senate versions of their respective bills on health-care reform. Though reconciliation is a drastic measure that should certainly be used only sparingly, it is perfectly appropriate as a last resort from the Democrats to solve a pressing national issue.
As expected, Republican Congressional leaders have unjustly criticized Obama’s suggestion of reconciliation, declaring that it represents an attempt to subvert the will of the people. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele described reconciliation as “a parliamentary trick”, while Senator Lindsay Graham (R – SC) described the effect of reconciliation as “catastrophic.” The Republican criticisms are highly disingenuous, however; of the 22 times reconciliation has been used since 1980, 17 were by Republicans. Most notably, the measure was used to pass both of President Bush’s tax cuts—an especially salient example, considering the 2003 tax-cut bill passed only after a tie-breaking, 51st vote cast by Vice President Cheney. Comparatively, the Senate passed its version of the health-care bill with 60 votes in December; if the tax cuts were passed using reconciliation by the Republicans, it is fair for the Democrats to use the measure as well.
Furthermore, we disapprove of the media’s reporting on the issue of health care and Congress’s attempt to reach an agreement on reform. Throughout the media coverage, the current effort to pass a bill has been portrayed as ramming reform down voters’ throats, despite the fact that the bill still has 59 votes in the Senate. From the usual conservative press coverage like The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times to more independent coverage like CNN and Time Magazine, the media has consistently and misguidedly portrayed the bill as blatantly ignoring the will of the people. Such reporting distracts from the real issues at hand and has taken away from many of the key issues of the debate.
Despite some botched handling of the issue, we do commend President Obama for sticking to health-care reform in spite of the difficult political climate. Burdened by other pressing issues, like the need for jobs creation and Sen. Scott Brown’s critical electoral win, the president has maintained focus on health care in the rising spotlight and not let the issue die. While many other issues merit action, health care is, nevertheless, one of the president’s top domestic priorities. Given the extraordinary efforts to derail it, President Obama has now acted decisively on the future of the bill.
In light of the current political situation, reconciliation is a legitimate and necessary move to finally assure the passage of a comprehensive health-care reform bill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever wonder whether the pretty blonde girl begging for money in the Square is actually an anthropology concentrator conducting an experiment for her thesis? Ever suspect that the bag she’s got under her poncho is actually a monogrammed Goyard?
Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised.
After all, while last year’s economic downturn may have palpably affected the Harvard undergraduate experience in the more noticeable currency of decreased funding for student initiatives, grants, and, of course, hot breakfast, it seems to have also amplified a peculiar, age-old tendency among the more well-moneyed of our peers. You can probably guess which one it is that I’m referring to—the apparent obligation to demonstrate a visible lack of immunity from economic hardship, when such is clearly not the case.
In other words, for some strange reason, many affluent students seem to be under the impression that by acting as “normal,” impecunious students, they will get more out of the collegiate experience while simultaneously making everyone else around them more comfortable. But hiding the extent of one’s privilege is hardly a means of experiencing “what it’s like” downstairs, and pretending as though certain affordable luxuries are just too expensive isn’t exactly considerate—it’s insulting.
First of all, I do not mean to define wealth merely from a superficial analysis of a person’s appearance or behavior: Obviously, someone in the Yard wearing a Burberry coat is not necessarily a card-carrying member of the American socio-economic elite. But as Harvard still educates a sizeable percentage of the children in this demographic, chances are that you’ve run across more than one in your time here. And I would be willing to bet that these wealthy individuals have actively attempted to hide the extent of their privilege, if only a little bit.
Also, I don’t mean to say that a number of our wealthy peers attempt to hide where they’re from, the schools they’ve gone to, or the things they’ve done in their lives. I merely mean that around Cambridge, they insist on taking the T because taxis are too expensive, avoid shopping at the Tannery because their budgets simply won’t allow, and ruminate deeply before dining out at any Square establishment more expensive than Café of India because, you know, it’s not really appropriate for college students to eat outside of the dining hall without a special occasion, right?
For one, small sacrifices like these come nowhere near simulating what it’s actually like to be on a real budget with a finite number of dollars to spend each week, no exceptions. Does having hot chocolate at Burdick’s only once a week instead of twice therefore teach anything other than affectation? Please. Also, how offensive does it seem to those who do operate on tight budgets when they hear their affluent friends complain about the price of an entrée at Grafton Street, especially when it’s evident that in four years, all of this feigned frugality will be a distant memory, another college phase like Rubinoff or Ritalin?
Regardless of the intentions behind this behavior, our wealthier peers should have no qualms about exercising the spending habits with which they were raised and that many of them will resume practicing immediately upon kissing Fair Harvard goodbye. In that sense, would a little more honesty really be that much more difficult to show?
Granted, it is no secret that the rich are difficult to understand. In fact, the only thing that can really be said with any certainty about them is what the narrator of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Rich Boy” tells us in the second sentence of the story. “They are very different from you and me,” he says.
Considering our very own pool of wealthy Harvard undergraduates, is the imperative to hide wealth beneath a veneer of more frugal circumstances—to be rich and to pretend to be otherwise—just another one of those inexplicable differences?
Let’s hope not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard professor Robert Putnam first coined the term “social capital” in his book “Bowling Alone,” in which he described the importance of a network, or community, for individuals.  Social networks foster a sense of belonging and increase one’s engagement in the community. In an age of technology, college students naturally think of Facebook or gchat as central to our social networks.  Beyond the cyber social circle, our networks may include entryways, teams, classmates, or extracurricular groups.  Each and every circle contributes to a network that builds social capital.
Two weeks ago, as part of Mental Health Awareness Week, Putnam spoke about that critical sense of belonging and its central importance to mental health. Psychological research in mental health shows that sound social support has demonstrable benefits, including greater longevity, greater functional ability, and better treatment outcomes. While the connection between community and mental health may seem obvious, it is a concept that the Harvard community needs to value more.
College years are challenging, and many people are vulnerable because of the pressure to meet exceedingly high expectations coupled with the first move from home. One of the best ways to deal with stress or difficulties is to share concerns with someone—whether it’s a counselor or just asking a friend for help when overwhelmed. A 2008 survey of Harvard students revealed that 77 percent turn to other students when they are feeling troubled.  Nearly 40 percent of Harvard students will have used services at University Mental Health Services or the Bureau of Study Counsel by the time they graduate. Having an accessible and trustworthy professional in one’s community is undeniably important.  These components of a social network are crucial to well-being and sense of belonging.
Not all is well when it comes to mental health awareness in the Harvard community.  The 2009 Freshmen Well-Being survey asked current Harvard freshmen a series of questions regarding their emotional well-being including, “How many people do you have in your life that you can really open up to about your most private feelings without having to hold back?” While a large majority of freshmen could name at least one person, there were 69 students who did not have anyone to share their feelings with.  Furthermore, students without any supportive relationships represented half of the small percentage of students who reported any suicidal indicators.  Loneliness and isolation are two of the risk factors for depression and can place people at risk for suicide.  Both this data and research purport that students with adequate social support have greater protection from major life stressors, and also adjust better to those stressful situations. A reduction in social support may explain some of the symptoms of depression. While these numbers may seem small, if it is you who is faced with a mental health crisis—your own, your roommate’s, or your friend’s—the risk factor is unacceptable. The well-being of individuals ultimately will affect the well-being of the community at large.
Even though students are educated and counseled about matters such as risky sexual behavior or substance abuse, awareness of mental health issues and ready access to resources seem to fall off of the radar. Every member of the Harvard community should be informed and empowered to confront mental health issues.  Harvard provides by-appointment mental health services through the BSC and UHS as well as 24-hour urgent care for students who need more immediate help than the appointment process can provide.  In addition, students from Harvard’s peer-counseling groups—Room 13, ECHO, Response, and Contact—are readily available for trained peer-to-peer support.  A system-wide approach to promoting mental health awareness has been initiated through the Student Mental Health Liaisons.  This student group organizes and presents the annual Mental Health Awareness week.  The purpose of the event is to widely share knowledge about issues of mental health, the importance of students’ mental and emotional well-being, and increase sensitivity to those who may suffer silently. The Student Mental Health Liaisons work within each of the Houses to provide a safe space for discussing mental health issues and help locate appropriate mental health resources for peers.  Informed students are empowered to reach out to friends in distress, and easily find a clear and accessible path to resources.  In an effort to increase awareness and education, the Student Mental Health Liaisons have broken ground to provide informational sessions on the available mental health resources as part of every freshman’s orientation next fall.
Fostering a sense of community, as Putnam suggests, leads to healthier individuals, and stronger communities. Our community must actively work to reduce the stigma surrounding issues of mental health and look out for signs of emotional distress in our friends.  By supporting efforts to increase the transparency and accessibility of campus mental health services, Harvard can be a place where each student feels confident, safe, and a sense of belonging.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are few constants in the video game industry, but console release dates used to be one of them. The closest thing to a law in the business was that a new generation of consoles gets released every five years, as they have since the early 1980s. But although Microsoft’s Xbox 360, the oldest current-generation console, will be turning five soon, none of the three major console makers has announced a new model. The tacit consensus among the big three to put off releasing new hardware may seem like a disappointment, but it is actually a blessing in disguise. Even though power gamers won’t get new hardware to play with, the next few years will likely be filled with incredible games.
Prospects for a new console announcement this year are dim. Rumors circulated that Nintendo might announce a new console at the Game Developers Conference this week, but Nintendo denied that this would be a new version of the Wii, which it hopes still has room to grow. Microsoft has proposed that its video motion-tracking system, Project Natal, will help extend the life of its console until 2015. Natal may be an amazing piece of technology—and a potential paradigm shift on par with Nintendo’s motion-sensing Wiimote—but it’s hardly the leap forward in rendering technology that power gamers crave. Finally, with Sony expecting to turn a profit on its PlayStation 3 hardware by 2011 at the earliest, it’s a bit of a stretch to think that its next console is less than another five years away.
One fortunate consequence is that, for the next five years, at least, gamers won’t have to shell out big bucks for hardware in order to stay up to date. Consoles are already prohibitively expensive for some gamers, and it’s hard to imagine that console makers could put a significant improvement over today’s technology on the market without a significant price hike, as well.
However, an even bigger reason why the console freeze is a boon for gamers and developers is that it will help spur innovation. Without the ability to wow gamers with technical wizardry, developers will be forced to think harder about different styles of play to keep their games fresh.
Take rendering, for instance; photorealism has been the goal for the past decade, and as polygon-pushing power has improved, games have inched closer and closer to a facsimile of the real world. Games that simulate life by rote copying can be very immersive, but developers need to improve constantly the accuracy of the simulation to prevent gamers from being disappointed. If developers aren’t able to cram more detail into their lifelike worlds, they’ll be forced to take the art direction of games away from reality to keep their games fresh and exciting. Games like Team Fortress 2, the most recent Prince of Persia, or even Braid make good use of unconventional rendering styles, but the door is wide open for wilder experimentation.
The console freeze may also lead to better games because it is easier for developers to work on systems that they already understand. Learning how to use the accelerometers in the Wiimote, for instance, may take years, and developers who have already made several titles for the Wii are more likely to understand how to use the controller to innovate or enhance immersion.
Similarly, the PS3 is a powerful but complicated system that rewards long-term effort. Online features like matchmaking are unnecessarily and sometimes deliberately complicated on the PS3. Functions performed easily by the graphics card on the Xbox have to be implemented on six smaller cores surrounding the main core, forcing programmers to have detailed experience with parallel computing. However, a studio that has had time to learn all of the idiosyncrasies of PS3 development may be able to better take advantage of the console’s strengths. Of the three consoles of the current generation, the PS3 has the greatest technical potential, and giving developers more time to understand it will only mean better games in the future.
More generally, having just a few console makers who release major upgrades less frequently and focus more on quality games is a better situation for the industry as a whole.  Video games famously hit rock bottom in 1983 from oversaturation. Developers had flooded the market with new consoles, each with a large library of games that were mostly low quality. Atari’s heavily promoted ET game, for instance, stunk so badly that Atari had to bury unsold and returned units in a New   Mexico landfill. The state of affairs today, with only three well-differentiated systems, bodes well for the industry beating its current slump and returning to form by next year.
Keeping console technology trapped around 2006 is not without its drawbacks. As graphics cards and processors available for PC continue to outstrip the console technology, developers may handicap their triple-A PC titles to conform to outdated console specifications. But for an industry that has been evolving at a breakneck pace for all of its short existence, extending the life of current consoles will be a relief to gamers and game makers alike.

Though the U.S. government has yet to recognize the post-World War I mass killings in Armenia as a genocide, some students and faculty at the Graduate School of Design have—and have taken action.
Two weeks ago, Design School professors Allen Sayegh and Martin Bechthold took 12 of their graduate students to Armenia.
The trip—which concluded last week—was part of a new studio class, which focuses on designing a genocide museum in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan.
In its conceptual phase, the project is meant to reside near the current genocide memorial in Yerevan, and will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the mass killings that occurred in Armenia at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in 1915.
Though the museum is only a design project—meant to encourage students to utilize immersive multimedia techniques to deal with a complex political issue—it has garnered attention in Armenia, the group said.
While in Armenia, Sayegh, Bechthold, and their students met with an array of people, including Armenian students, professors, descendents of survivors, and government officials, to try to grasp the complexity of the event’s legacy.
“It’s a controversial topic, especially right now, how politics is involved in human rights issues, and about how you take all these forces to come up a with a museum when you don’t have any artifacts,” Sayegh said.
Both professors said they felt it was important for their students to physically be in Armenia and experience the ways in which the mass killings have affected the country.
“For the students, it opened up...a complexity which they probably were not able to grasp before the trip,” Bechthold said. “The denial is like a thorn in the flesh that is just not going away.”
Bechthold and Sayegh’s students agreed with these sentiments.
“[Armenians] are trying to emerge out of the genocide and Soviet rule,” said Tricia L. Ebner, who is a student in the class. “The key to attacking this is by inserting elements [in the conceptual museum’s design] which can be identified as moving forward.”
The project comes in the wake of new political developments in the U.S. While the House of Representatives signaled its readiness last week to vote on recognition of the 1915 mass killings in Armenia as a genocide, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the White House would try to block such a vote—despite Obama’s campaign promise to recognize the killings as a genocide.
Turkey is currently an American ally, noted by assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan and involvement in the trade of oil and natural gas.

Few days on campus are host to the emotional roller coaster that is the morning of Housing Day—and upperclassmen in the 12 undergraduate Houses plan to ratchet up the enthusiasm among their new housemates.
Around 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, upperclass dorm-stormers will pound on the doors of freshmen to personally deliver housing assignments. They will then continue the celebration in Annenberg Hall by dispensing House-related paraphernalia to newly-minted housemates.
Some Houses have gotten a head start on Housing Day by promoting their respective homes with humorous videos and eye-catching posters.
Currier, Leverett, and Pforzheimer have already sought to whet the appetite of freshmen with videos ranging from musical homages to “C-Haus,” to an extended rant from Adolf Hitler about the pains of living in Adams.
Meanwhile, Eliot has been working on the production of a video, wrote Eliot HoCo co-chair Tian Feng ’11 in an e-mailed statement. The Mather House Committee promised to release a video a minute before midnight yesterday.
Currier has traditionally set itself apart from the other Houses by “having far more spirit,” wrote Sami Majadla ’11, Currier House Committee chair, in an e-mailed statement. “We plan on keeping that tradition alive this year.”
Majadla added that freshmen who receive Currier as their housing assignment should look forward to “spectacular fireworks over the Quad” and a night of paintballing in the hallways of Cabot.
But not all of the Houses plan on launching elaborate advertising campaigns catered toward freshmen—perhaps the result of the sentiment that such preparations are unnecessary.
“Kirkland isn’t very interested in this Housing Day competition stuff,” said Kelly N. Bodwin ’11, Kirkland HoCo chair. “We know we love it here, and we know the new freshmen will love it here—we don’t feel the need to prove our greatness on one random day out of the year when we’ve already proved it the other 364.”
Bodwin said that her house is not “doing much” in the weeks leading up to Housing Day, though it has voted on a T-shirt design and plans to hold a Master’s Open House on the night of Housing Day to welcome the incoming freshmen.
Despite the advertising campaigns that have emerged in the days leading up to Housing Day, the Houses remain good-natured about the competition.
"Between HoCos, there’s always some friendly competition about making good posters and getting the biggest screaming mob,” Bodwin said. “But there’s not a lot of ‘My House is better’ competition between us—we’re all on HoCo because we think our House is the best.”

The Undergraduate Council’s Election Reform Task Force presented a comprehensive report endorsing 11 specific recommendations at last night’s general meeting to address weaknesses revealed by November’s highly controversial elections.
The task force—which presented the report—proposed preliminary suggestions concerning the Election Commission’s operations and the use of technology throughout the elections process, according to Rules Committee Chair and Task Force Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12.
The report recommended that the Election Commission, a non-partisan body of students that oversees and regulates the elections process, will be reduced from seven members to five in order to minimize coordination costs, said Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11.
Students on the Election Commission would also receive a stipend in order to attract a more diverse group of applicants to the Commission, said UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11. In addition, current UC members or candidates running in the elections will not be allowed to serve on the Commission—a eligibility requirement that would be formalized for the first time.
Voting software would be adjusted to incorporate a “keys” system that requires simultaneous password input from five of eight “trustees” in order to access election results. These “trustees” would consist of some combination of deans, EC commissioners, and the current UC president, the report stated.
Fabrizio added that the UC has worked with the Office of Student Life and Faculty of Arts and Sciences IT Services to replace the current election system with Helios software, a system that Princeton’s undergraduate student government has implemented with favorable results. Helios has a much simpler interface and is compatible with the “keys” system, Hysen said.
“There is still going to be more discussion here, and these are only preliminary ideas from one body,” Martinez said, noting that the report will provide the framework for actual legislation to be passed by the entire UC within the next couple weeks.
In addition to the presentation of election reform, the Council passed legislation to formalize the launch of Crimson Forum, a Web site that encourages undergraduates to discuss a wide variety of academic and campus-related issues. The site’s content will be similar to discussions held over House lists but will instead be consolidated in one spot, according to project manager and Student Initiatives Committee member Tengbo Li ’12.
The site will be implemented as a project of Legata, an independent, student-run company that currently hosts Crimsonlist, Harvard’s version of the online classifieds Web site Craigslist.
Hysen said the UC will be a “non-paying client” that focuses on generating publicity as well as providing 40 student moderators to ensure accurate information and appropriate language on the site. Legata will primarily deal with the technological aspect of the forum.
The UC originally sought to launch its own version of the advising siteunder the name Crimson Commons before realizing that Legata was simultaneously building a similar model of its own.
“It just didn’t make sense to have two,” Li said. “The bottom line is to serve the student body and this partnership will be the best way.”

CLARIFICATIONS: March 8, 2010
Due to an editing error, the print version of the Mar. 8 news article "Election Change Endorsed By UC" featured a jump headline that read "UC Makes Changes to Election Commission." To clarify, the Undergraduate Council's Election Reform Task Force presented a report endorsing 11 specific recommendations that are only preliminary at this stage and have yet to be given final approval.
In addition, due to an editing error, the print version of the article included a glance box that listed the "launch of Crimsonforum" as part of the election process changes endorsed by the UC. To clarify, at the same meeting, the Council passed legislation to formalize the launch of Crimson Forum, but the agenda item was unrelated to the election process changes.

After failing to reach a consensus at its second meeting in January, the Cambridge Climate Congress passed three proposals Saturday with recommendations addressing environmental challenges.
The 50 delegates that gathered in City Hall voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing the proposals, which ranged from creating infrastructure to hiring a point person to direct the city’s sustainability efforts.
Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher applauded the Congress’s initiative at the grassroots level to push through proposals for concrete steps the city can take.
“In order to be successful, you have to have a give and take with the city and the residents,” Maher said. “The city has the resources, but the drive has to come from the residents.”
The 13-member drafting committee spent the last month revising their recommendations after delegates voted to postpone a final vote at the previous session.
The first proposal, which was added since the last meeting, focused on creating infrastructure to integrate environmental efforts across diverse community groups and neighborhoods.
The other two suggested climate initiatives for the city—including setting annual energy efficiency goals and partnering with local businesses to encourage sustainable practices.
The proposed creation of a chief sustainability officer was met with the most enthusiasm, and Maher said he believes this recommendation is the most likely to be passed by the city government.
The Congress will also be sending the City Council a list of specific suggestions, such as establishing tax-incentives for energy-efficient upgrades and revamping environmental education.
Maher said that despite the city’s tough financial situation, he is working with coordinators of the Congress to integrate some of the proposals into the ongoing budgeting process.
After voting on the proposals, the delegates split into working groups to discuss specific city-wide projects, including installing solar panels on public buildings and creating a more sustainable transportation policy.
John Pitkin, a member of the drafting and planning committee, said that these working groups will be largely responsible for implementing plans at the community level.
His fellow delegate Steve Morr-Wineman agreed that Cambridge residents will play a key role in effecting actual change in the city.
“[It’s] a mistake to come out and wait for the council to take action,” Morr-Wineman said. “We need a public ground swell to make something happen. On the other hand we can’t let the city off the hook.”

As the Harvard community celebrates Women’s Week over the next seven days, students may notice a new fashion statement on campus—shirts with the declaration, “This is what a feminist looks like.”
Close to a hundred women and men crammed into the Women’s Week kick-off party last night in Ticknor Lounge, discussing their excitement for the upcoming week as they donned t-shirts stating “Strength Through Solidarity,” a theme that has guided much of the planning.
Several student groups—including Latinas Unidas, the Environmental Action Committee, and Harvard Men Against Rape—will be collaborating on events this week, such as discussions on gender and race, environmental and reproductive justice, and pornography.
“The way the women’s community can be strongest is to work together,” said Alice M. Laramore ’11, an intern at the Harvard College Women’s Center who helped plan the events this week. “This event unites all of Harvard’s women’s groups in support of the common goal of Women’s Week.”
Gina Helfrich, Assistant Director of the Women’s Center, said that the goal of this week’s collaboration is to raise awareness of women’s accomplishments, community, and issues. In keeping with this goal, Helfrich emphasized that the week is meant to reach out not only to women, but the entire community.
“I think it’s a mistake to think about women’s issues as only relevant to women and the niche that women fit into,” she said. “Women face similar problems and callenges across diverse social situations, but that’s something everyone should be able to connect with.”
Harvard kicks off the week with its first annual Feminist Coming Out Day in which students will wear the t-shirts declaring themselves as feminists.
“It’s important for people to embrace that word because there’s such a stigma around it,” said Laramore. “Having people come out as feminists in a public way will bring people closer to the term and allow them to really own it.”
Part of Feminist Coming Out Day is an art exhibit opening tonight which features portraits of students, faculty, and administrators at Harvard who identify as feminists. The participants include Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz, President of the Harvard Democrats Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 and Student Advisory Committee President Mary K.B. Cox ’10.
The portraits in Adams Art Space will be accompanied by paragraphs explaining how each participant understands or connects with the movement and are meant to be visual reminders that feminism can exist in all types of people.
“I think feminism has gotten a bad rap and usually conjures up images of radical and man-hating women,” said Emma Q. Wang ’12, co-chair of the Harvard Queer Students and Allies Political Committee. “But the fact is feminism is really about respecting the equality of genders, and I hope this week will help people realize that.”

A 14-year-old rattles off the names of eight of Harvard’s Houses, listing Pforzheimer, Currier, and Cabot without a second thought. His 12-year-old sister plays on the C-league Pforzheimer House intramural basketball team and participates in the weekly Pfoho craft circle. Their 17-year old brother casually uses Harvard lingo, talking about concentrations, dining halls, and tutors in everyday conversation.
These kids may not be Harvard students yet, but Lena, Lysander, and Sebastian—the children of Pforzheimer House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86—sound and behave just like average Harvard undergrads, despite their ages—12, 14, and 17 years old respectively.
The children of House Masters face an unusual position, living among college students while observing their parents’ responsibilities firsthand.
House Masters may be bringing their experience and knowledge to the Harvard community, but they are also bringing their families, who can be profoundly impacted by having their doors open to hundreds of Harvard undergrads.
JOINING THE COMMUNITY
Having moved in to Pforzheimer House last year, Lena and Lysander say they both quickly fell in love with the House—but only after some initial anxiety on Lena’s part. The two are involved in House life: Lysander visits the Pfoho Grille so frequently that the student employees know his burger order, and Lena participates in intramurals and joins Pfoho seniors for movie nights.
Sebastian says his adjustment was more difficult. As a 17-year-old high school student, he is closer in age to the average Pfoho resident and is often mistaken for an undergraduate, he says. But as a junior preparing for college at the Cambridge School of Weston, he says he has less time than his siblings to devote to House activities.
Still, Sebastian says he enjoys the new resources available to him—especially getting homework help and SAT advice from undergraduates—but he adds that it can be challenging to constantly present themselves as the member of a “House Master family.”
Across campus, Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73 have been Mather House Masters for 18 years, so their son Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13 remembers no other way of life. In fact, he says his first memory is frolicking in the Mather House basement. Most of his childhood memories revolve around Mather House, from playing four square with students in the Mather courtyard to playing Linus in the Mather production of “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.”
Benjamin’s babysitters were a rotating cast of Harvard students, including former Mather resident David J. Malan ’99, who is the instructor for the popular introductory course, Computer Science 50. Benjamin says he considers Malan a part of his extended Mather family.
“It’s part of our mission to have an intergenerational community,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson says. “We think it’s one of our strongest assets.”
KEEPING FAMILY LIFE PRIVATE
Even as the children become an integral part of the House community, they say their parents strive to keep their family life as normal—and as private—as possible.
The daily life of a House Master’s family differs immensely from an average child’s home life. On any given night, hundreds of college students could be in the living room for a Master’s Open House or the Masters could be meeting with tutors or House Committee members.
Many of the House Masters’ residences are even physically connected to undergraduate housing, furthering the sense that the Masters and their family cannot exist as a unit separate from the broader House community.
“There’s a lot of presentation involved in being a House Master family, and giving a good image, and all that stuff,” Sebastian says.
But all the Christakis children and Benjamin say that their parents have successfully separated their private family lives from their obligations as Masters.
“Despite all of that, I respect my parents immensely because they really fostered a sense of home,” Benjamin says, “a sense of having a closed family unit living inside Mather that had its private moments as well as its public moments. It never felt like there were any significant intrusions on our privacy or anything like that. It was just an expansive family.”
HEADING TO HARVARD
Now a Harvard freshman, Benjamin moved from Mather to Matthews this August.
Benjamin says his transition to college life was very different than that of most freshmen. He already knew Harvard lingo, for example, and could navigate the Yard. But he adds that he had to struggle to separate his college life from his home life.
A Crimson arts editor and guitarist in a band, Benjamin says much of his desire to attend Harvard stemmed from his admiration of the Mather residents he knew as a child.
“A lot of people ask me: why would I want to stay here?” Benjamin says. “There’s no better place for me. There’s no place where I fit in more or where I feel as accepted or as free to grow and change, or where I can actually be one of these kids that I idolized for however many years.”
In contrast, Sebastian says he has not narrowed down his choice of college yet, although, as a junior, many months remain before now and the application deadline. Nonetheless, he certainly plans on applying to Harvard.
“I’m really looking forward to starting fresh,” Sebastian says. “I’m looking forward to applying, but I think it will be cool to scope out all of my options.”
HOUSE AS HOME
Despite the arguably unusual nature of House family life, the children of House Masters rave about the benefits of living within a House: learning about college life, soliciting advice from undergrads, and adapting to change as House residents come and go.
Above all, the children emphasize the value of House community.
“Mather House wasn’t just a house. It was a home,” Benjamin says. “There was no better place to grow up than Mather House.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten months ago, a struggling endowment forced the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to cut up to 25 percent of the Houses’ budgets.
The reductions took many forms. Some eliminated jobs held by undergraduate students, while others limited the number of non-resident tutors and the perks they received.
House events also faced minor tweaks. The number of events decreased marginally, and preparations for study breaks and Masters’ Open Houses were slightly altered to save money without students noticing.
While administrators and tutors can speak at length about how the limited effects of the cuts, no one is certain as to when they will end—and given history and future plans, that end may not come anytime soon.
FIRST CAME THE CUTS
While each House has dealt with the increased financial limitations in a different way, no House has been immune to the budget cuts, which FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced last May.
The cuts to the House budgets can be characterized by their minimal impact on student life and their adherance to the top priorities of the College—academics and the House system—according to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
“What we’ve tried to do is not to take what students would experience but try to be more efficient internally,” she said in an interview last month.
After receiving the news that their funds would be restricted, many Houses developed innovative ways to cut costs. Lowell House put its House directory online instead of printing copies out for residents, saving about $10,000, while Mather House Committee members participated in a day of Dorm Crew in order to raise money for Mather Lather.
But the cutbacks have also required the Houses to make some more substantial changes to the services they provide.
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said the House cut “some of the slightly fancier ingredients” in Masters’ Open Houses, but also had to eliminate the federal work-study jobs of students who worked in the library and superintendent’s office.
“The library has suffered tremendously,” he said. “I actually haven’t heard back from the work-study students on where they’re finding roles.”
Some Houses, such as Adams, have resorted to their rainy day funds, while others, like Mather, have had their House Masters subsidize events.
“They’ve been remarkably generous, above and beyond what’s even reasonable, which has been really helpful given our budget,” said Mather House Committee historian Anna S. Roth ’12.
THEN IT WAS ALL RESTORED?
While House affiliates have resigned themselves to the current budgetary restrictions for the time being, what no one has been able to answer is when House budgets will resume the form they had before 2009.
“We hope that it doesn’t last too long, but really that’s out of our hands,” said Lowell House resident tutor Van C. Tran. “That’s really something that the dean has to think about and hopefully allocate money within the constraints of the larger University community.”
Though they may be unpleasant, Nelson said that the cuts have forced Houses to consider how they spend their money.
“Let’s all hope that everything’s going to turn around,” Nelson said. “The whole country hopes for this. All of us will have more breathing room with our budgets.”
Even if the nation’s economy and, in turn, the endowment rebound, Palfrey said he does not anticipate an immediate resurgence in funds.
Moreover, while he acknowledged that administrators understand the importance of the House system, he cited a period between 2005 and 2008 which he described as a time when they bolstered their own offices but not the Houses.
“They had a little more money, so the administration improved or increased the administrative budgets,” he said. “Truth be told, when the budget cuts occurred, they had to cut back their administrative budget, but they also cut back the House budget, which had not increased by the same degree–if at all—during the expansion.”
Where budgetary priorities will lie after the financial crisis is alleviated is also not clear. Assuming an economic recovery in 2011, any possible subsequent increase in the House budgets would coincide with the House renewal project, whose start date of 2012 was maintained as recently as February by Nelson.
But Palfrey is hopeful that the limits on his House’s budget will be loosened.
“We do meet with the President. We meet with the dean of FAS. We meet with the dean of the College, and they do seem to care. So our hope is they’ll restore it,” Palfrey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 150 city and state government officials and Harvard graduate students spent their Saturday at the first “Government 2.0” camp to be hosted in Cambridge at Harvard Kennedy School learning to apply current social media tools in local government.
The free day-long camp—billed as an “unconference” where attendees voted on which topics they wanted to present or discuss—featured discussions ranging from “Tweeting like a Pro” to engaging citizens in data-driven case studies.
Much of the discussion at the unconference, which was sponsored by the Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, centered around using the Web for organizing the community and engaging constituents through social media.
The event organizer and Kennedy School student Yasmin S. Fodil said she hoped participants will apply what they learned at the unconference to “explore how government can use technology to be more efficient, collaborative, and transparent.”
Unlike more traditional conferences, the Government 2.0 camp allowed participants to focus on topics that interest them and share their ideas by leading their own sessions, according to the event’s co-organizer Sarah E. Bourne, who is the Mass. government’s chief technology strategist.
“I’ve never been to a conference where you get so much value,” Bourne said.
Bourne added that she hopes a similar participant-driven event in the future would allow attendees to raise “more sophisticated questions” once local government services start using more social media tools.
“It’s a nice benchmark for how use of these tools has matured and integrated into providing government services,” Bourne said of the level of questions raised during such events.
Jeff Blasius, chief technology officer of SeeClickFix.com, an online tool that allows anyone to report and track non-emergency issues, said that he appreciated the flexibility and emphasis on the participant’s needs at the event.
“It was excellent,” Blasius said. “There are a lot of big thinkers here.”
But Jesse L. Weiss, a social media coordinator who led one of the sessions at the camp, said that though the event provided an opportunity to network with peers, the unconference is not necessarily a better alternative to more structured traditional conferences.
“Both have their time and place,” Weiss said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding the momentum of its team performance at the Ivy League Championships a week ago, the Harvard track and field team sent athletes to three different meets this weekend, notching a number of standout finishes.
After months of posting qualifying times for IC4As and ECACs, the Crimson split up, with the men heading to the BU Track and Tennis center for IC4As and the women taking on the ECAC field at the Reggie Lewis Center in Roxbury.
“Overall for the team, the Ivy League championships are a bigger focal point,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “When you get into that next level of competition...we just try to make the most of a great opportunity.”
The Crimson competitors did just that, breaking a pair of school records and winning an IC4A relay among some of the most talented teams in the region.
“It was a good way to close the season and get some good performances in,” women’s captain Thea Lee said. “We were happy to end on a good note.”
ECAC CHAMPIONSHIPS
The women did not have to travel far to take on a number of unfamiliar competitors during the ECAC championships Saturday and yesterday. The women finished 16th in a field in which 51 teams scored, riding the strong performances of a pair of freshmen and a relay team.
Rookie Sydnie Leroy earned seventh in the pole vault with a mark of 3.55 meters, while classmate Olivia Weeks posted the top individual finish, taking third in the triple jump after a leap of 12.21 meters.
“Olivia had a little trouble getting to the board, but when she hit it, she hit it well,” Saretsky said. “She had the biggest jump of her collegiate career.”
Sophomore Nicole Cochran also had a strong performance in the mile, taking fourth place after a disappointing showing at Heptagonals.
“[Cochran] is the type of athlete that runs her best at championship time,” Saretsky said. “She made a tactical mistake that cost her points [at Heps], so it was great to see her bounce back and place as high as she did.”
But perhaps the strongest effort came from a group of Harvard women, as Lee, junior Claire Richardson, and freshmen Carlyle Davis and Melissa Bellin broke the school record in the distance medley relay en route to a third-place finish. The four Crimson runners crossed the line in a cumulative 11:34.03.
“We were really excited,” Lee said. “We all ran the best leg that we possibly could, so it was a really good showing.”
IC4A CHAMPIONSHIPS
Not to be outdone, the men’s squad enjoyed success of its own at IC4As Saturday and yesterday. The distance medley again proved to be Harvard’s greatest strength, as six runners contributed to the event. After sophomores Darcy Wilson and Brian Paison and rookies Jeff Homer and Jeremy Gilmour posted the fastest preliminary time in the relay, juniors Brian Hill and Dan Chenoweth stepped in to replace the second-years, boosting the team to a first-place finish in the finals—just seconds off the Crimson record. The time of 9:52.66 gave the Harvard men the victory by nearly three seconds.
“[In the preliminaries] the guys rocked it, and today we came in even hotter,” Hill said. “Even better is that all six of us who were involved are returning next year, so we’re going to be looking to knock on the door of the [school] record.”
The victory proved especially sweet for Chenoweth, who had come in as runner-up at IC4As the past two years.
“The distance medley is sort of like ‘Captain Planet,’ because you have to have all the elements together,” Chenoweth said. “[Winning] was definitely better than second. It was a pretty big meet, so it was cool that we put together a good race.”
The meet was so large, in fact, that some Harvard competitors stood out despite finishing out of the top 10. Freshman Ablorde Ashigbi finished 13th in the weight throw while sophomore John Dingus broke his own school record in the 400-meter race with a time of 47.73—but finished one spot out of the finals.
COLUMBIA LAST CHANCE MEET
Hill and Davis logged extra time on the track this weekend, traveling to New York City to compete at the Columbia Last Chance Meet at the Armory Track and Field Center on Friday.
Davis raced outside her normal distance, but managed a fourth-place finish in the 800-meter race with a time of 2:09.17. Hill—right at home at the 800 distance—won the same event in 1:49.96.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After struggling to get a win in its first nine games of the season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (1-9, 1-1 EIVA Hay Division) finally came away with a much-needed victory after splitting two games this weekend with Stevens Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
Using a new lineup, which moved co-captain Gil Weintraub to the setter position, the team got the chemistry it needed to finally get a win.
“Our reasoning behind it was that all our other lineups we were working with, with our various injuries, weren’t working, so we just tried something new,” co-captain Eric Kuld said. “Gil [was] back in as setter. We moved some hitters around. The changes seemed to be working pretty well. Everyone was pretty comfortable with the team.”
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
A kill by Weintraub sealed Harvard’s first win of the season on Saturday against NJIT at the Fleisher Athletic Center. The Crimson took an early lead on the strong performance of sophomores Matt Jones and Nicola Ivica and never looked back, defeating the Highlanders (1-11, 1-4) in straight sets.
“We had to get it, and we got it,” said Kuld about the importance of the win. “It was confidence building. We’re still 1-1 in our conference. It was a huge win. We needed it, and we got it.”
Harvard dominated statistically and led NJIT in every category from kills to team blocks.
Jones recorded 20 kills to lead the Crimson offense, and Ivica had 16 kills while making only three errors on 23 attack attempts.
Weintraub handed out 47 assists on the night, and senior middle blocker Soren Rosier had seven solo blocks to lead the team defensively.
“We have a really great and strong sophomore class,” Kuld said about the strong performance of Jones and Ivica. “It was great to have them firing on all cylinders. It was great to watch.”
Indeed, Ivica sparked Harvard by recording a kill on the first point and building up a 10-5 Crimson lead early in the first set. The Highlanders were struggling with a slew of attack problems, and Harvard took advantage of that to take the first set, 30-21. The second set looked very much like the first, with Harvard jumping out to an early lead due to its strong service game and great defense, recording eight aces and winning, 30-24.
“I think we served well,” Jones said. “One of their outside hitters couldn’t pass very well, so we served to him a lot. We did a good job targeting him, and they were out of sync a lot.”
While the third set was close at first, Harvard went on a 6-0 run to build an insurmountable lead, and Weintraub’s kill gave the Crimson a much-needed victory.
“We kind of found our identity now,” said Jones about the team’s performance. “Playing the way [we are] is definitely a spark for the rest of the season. This is definitely the first of what I think will be many more wins.”
SIT 3, HARVARD 1
Despite a glimmer of hope in the third set, the Harvard men’s volleyball team fell to Stevens Institute of Technology, 3-1 (31-29, 30-27, 23-30, 30-23), at Canavan Arena on Friday.
The Crimson committed several key service errors in the fourth set that sealed the match for the Ducks (13-8, 4-2 NECVA Metro Division).
“It was a game we could’ve won, should’ve won,” Kuld said. “If we were able to play [Friday night] over again, we would’ve definitely won.”
Ivica and Jones again led the offense with 17 and 15 kills, respectively, and Weintraub handed out 44 assists on the night. Harvard also held an 8-7 advantage in team blocks, with freshman Paul Glootz recording two solo blocks.
But the real story of this game was the Crimson’s new lineup, which used the contest as a valuable experience in team building.
“We’re trying a new lineup,” Weintraub said, “[and] I thought we showed a lot of moments of brilliance.”
Harvard made a run in the first set and led SIT, 29-28, before giving up a run on the last three points to drop the set. The second set was close as well with the score tied at 25-25, before the Ducks outscored the Crimson, 5-3, to take the set. After taking the third set, Harvard could not stop SIT’s 8-3 run, which clinched the set as well as the game for the Ducks.
“We were in control of the game for a good portion of it,” Jones said. “It was just giving up those runs. The biggest part of volleyball is minimizing runs, because every team is going to make their run.”

The Harvard women’s tennis team ended its two-game losing streak, defeating the University of Central Florida (7-2) on Saturday in Orlando by a score of 6-1. With the win, the Crimson improved to 6-4 on the season.
The win was the first victory of the season for Harvard on an opponent’s court. The match also marked the first time the Crimson has played outdoors this year.
Harvard’s only two losses in the afternoon were at No. 6 singles and No. 3 doubles.
Still, the Knights kept the contest competitive, as half of the singles matches were decided in the third set.
Junior captain Samantha Rosekrans won in dominating fashion, winning in two sets by the score of 6-1, 6-4.
Most of the other matches, however, were much more back-and-forth. Crimson sophomore No. 84 Holly Cao rebounded after a weak second set to defeat No. 83 Jenny Frisell, 6-0, 1-6, 6-1, in the top position.
“Holly’s a fighter—­she probably got mad after the second set and just decided that she wasn’t going to lose any games. And when she gets mad at somebody...she can do whatever she wants,” sophomore Samantha Gridley said.
Cao was coming off of her first individual loss of the season against Illinois last Sunday.
Rosekrans and Cao, partners in the No. 1 doubles match, defeated the Central Florida team of Frisell and Katie Orletsky, 8-6, to help Harvard take the doubles point.
“It’s really nice to get that doubles win, because it really takes off the pressure going into singles,” Rosekrans said. “So that was a big victory.”
Orletsky picked up the Knight’s only singles victory of the day, defeating Gridley, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5.
“I started off down, and then came back and won a bunch of games in a row to win the first set,” Gridley said. “I ended up fighting back in the third set to five-all after being down, but then just got a little bit tight.”
The Crimson’s other ranked player, No. 113 freshman Hideko Tachibana, defeated Alexis Rodriguez, 6-4, 6-2, at No. 2.
Though Harvard rookie Sophie Chang swept her match against Allison Hodges, it was arguably the most competitive contest of the day. Chang had to win a deciding seventh game in both sets, including a tiebreak in the first set. Chang pulled the match out with a 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 win, despite trailing, 4-1, in each set.
“I really saw her fighting hard and staying really positive,” Gridley said. “That helped her pull through the match.”
Chang’s individual victory was her first since Feb. 14 against Princeton.
“Sophie wasn’t playing her best, but she managed to find a way,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “All semester we’ve been working on trying to find a way, and today she found a way and also got a victory for the team.”
Freshman Kristin Norton, after a sound defeat at the hands of Andrea Yacaman in the first set, returned the favor in the next two, winning the match, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2.
But it was the Central Florida fans who made the match particularly memorable.
“Norton had a really tough match, particularly with the fans—she faced a lot of different characters off the court, but she did a good job of rising up and not acting too emotionally,” Rosekrans said.
“The people kept telling us to go back to the library,” Gridley said, laughing. “Kristin got really, really pissed and just started winning.”
Norton, playing with Tachibana, also won in the No. 2 doubles match, defeating their Knight opponents, 8-3.
“I was really proud of the way we came together,” Rosekrans said. “We showed a lot of heart and...pretty much dominat[ed], so it was a really successful day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everything wasn’t going to be handed to freshman Laura Gemmell so easily.
She’s made winning seem effortless throughout the season, but it all came down to a grueling championship match against Trinity’s Pamela Hathway at the 2010 CSA Women’s Individual Championship in Hartford, Conn. yesterday. Ending the season 16-0, Gemmell maintained perfection in her first year of collegiate squash and has set the bar high for next year when the team and Gemmell seek to defend their respective titles.
“I was very pleased for Laura because she deserved the win,” said Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa. “Based on her overall record, there was a lot of pressure on her. She could see the pressure and handled it well and came through with the win.”
In their first encounter this season, Gemmell had no problems defeating the once top-ranked player in the country. The score line shows that the Bantam player didn’t put up much resistance back in January, losing to the freshman, 11-6, 11-6, 11-7.
This time around, the situation was much different.
Hathway summoned some of her best play for a matchup where everything was on the line. The junior from Trinity knew that this would be one of the few chances left in her collegiate career to shine before the emerging Gemmell would assume the throne.
The rising star started off the day with a solid win in the first game, 11-7, giving the impression that the matchup would be a repeat of what happened earlier in the season. Hathway had different ideas, answering back with a strong 11-5 victory of her own—just the second game Gemmell had dropped all season. The first one came in the first-round matchup against Cornell’s Rebecca Hazwell, a contest Gemmell won, 3-1.
Tied at one, Gemmell and Hathway duked it out in the third game, each one trying to assert her superiority over the other. Hathway took the match, 15-13, giving herself some breathing room and putting all the pressure on Gemmell to come from behind.
The freshman was undeterred. Hathway tried to stand her ground, but Gemmell overcame the German national player in the fourth game, 11-8.
There could only be one champion, and the parity was broken late in the fifth set. With the game tied at nine, it could have gone either way. But Gemmell successfully completed what she started, becoming the first Crimson player to take home the Ramsay Cup since Kyla Griggs ’07 won it in 2007. Gemmell won two straight points to win the fifth game without overtime, 11-9.
“To win anything is difficult,” Bajwa said. “It’s so great to achieve something you fight so hard to win. To win in five is hard to get.”
But Gemmell wasn’t the only Harvard player competing this weekend. Nine Crimson women’s squash players represented Harvard in two simultaneous competitions. Six players, including Gemmell, were entered in the “A” Division, while three competed in the “B” Division.
Harvard showed its depth and finesse at the tournament, with many players making deep runs in each bracket, and ultimately having two champions.
Co-captain Katherine O’Donnell ended her collegiate career with a bang as she captured the Holleran Cup, the “B” Division title. She defeated another Trinity player, senior Jo-Ann Jee, by the same 3-2 margin.
“I felt really excited,” O’Donnell said. “It’s a good way to cap off my college career. During the weekend I had a lot of matches, and it felt good to win them all.”
Fellow co-captain Johanna Snyder also fared well in competition play for the Ramsay Cup, the “A” division prize. She defeated sixth-seeded Trinity player Nour Baghat to reach the quarterfinals, where she ultimately lost to Penn’s Kristin Lange.
“Johanna was wondering whether she would be in the top nine last year, so she worked hard and improved,” Bajwa said. “She had an amazing finish. Both captains really led by example.”
After winning the team national title last week, this was a fittingly perfect end for the Crimson, a program that will graduate three seniors but will still have a core of strong players to defend those crowns next season.

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team couldn’t make a big enough splash this past weekend, as the Princeton Tigers swam their way to the Ivy League Championship.
The Crimson came in second place behind Princeton (7-0) at the three-day meet in Princeton’s Denunzio Pool, matching last season’s finish at the same event. Harvard finished ahead of the six other Ivy League teams, beating third-place Columbia by nearly 350 points and the University of Pennsylvania by over 380 points.
While the Crimson was looking to beat the Tigers this season and finish in first, many team members were still happy with the result and the improvements that the squad had made since last season. Harvard (7-2) finished with 1,341.5 points in the Thursday-to-Saturday meet, while Princeton earned a total of 1,552.5 points.
“I think we’ve improved since last season,” junior Jordan Diekema said. “We were more cohesive and more motivated as a team. We were the underdogs, but we still felt that we had a chance to beat Princeton.”
The Crimson started off the event on the first day with some solid finishes, but did not come out quite strong enough as it ended the day with 317 points, already trailing behind Princeton’s 423.5 points. Co-captain Alex Meyer secured the first event win for Harvard with a time of 4:22.98 in the 500-yard freestyle, an NCAA-qualifying time.
Sophomore Robert Newell finished sixth in 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:48.87, adding 24 points to his team’s total.
Harvard also had good results from its diving team, with freshman Michael Stanton and junior Zac Ranta coming in first and seventh, respectively, in the three-meter diving finals. Stanton’s effort was good enough for an NCAA “A” cut.
“The first day, we came out a little too tense and nervous because we had high expectations,” co-captain Tommy Gray said. “We took a big hit that first day, but we had a great meeting after the final session and we were a ton better the next two days.”
The Crimson held on to second place after the second day of competition but could not catch up to the dominant Tigers. Princeton increased its lead by 61.5 points to maintain the first-place position with 1.027.5 points to Harvard’s 859.5 points.
“The first day was a bit rough, and we started out a bit slow,” junior Jordan Diekema said. “I think the team got better as the meet progressed.”
The highlight for the Crimson on Friday came when Meyer and junior Blake Lewkowitz finished one-two in the 1,650-yard freestyle to pick up a combined 60 points for the team. Stanton took home his second title of the weekend in the one-meter diving competition, making an NCAA “A” cut in this event as well. Diekema also finished first in the 100-yard backstroke.
“I was pretty happy with my performance on Friday,” Diekema said. “I had been out of the water for four months this season due to health issues, so I felt I did well considering the circumstances.”
Harvard tried to improve on the third day of the meet and surpass the Tigers, but even strong finishes in the distance events could not do the job, as Princeton swam to a first-place finish. Meyer won the 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:01.87, almost nine seconds ahead of second place.
“That was just a few seconds off of my best time,” Meyer said. “It was my last race of my collegiate career, excluding the NCAA Championships, so it was good to finish strong.”
Meyer was also given two individual awards at the end of the meet for being the career-high point swimmer in the Ivy League and the meet-high point swimmer. Stanton took home the award for the top-scoring diver at the meet.
“It was an honor to receive those awards,” Meyer said. “I put in a lot of work in the last four seasons with this team, and it feels good, because I worked hard for this.”
The Crimson turns its focus onto the NCAA Zone Diving Competition in Piscataway, N.J. next weekend and the NCAA Championships two weeks after that.
“I’m looking to get back in the water and do a lot of work for the next two weeks [to prepare for the NCAA Championship],” Meyer said. “Hopefully, I can find a way to improve my time by a few seconds to win the title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his last match as a collegiate squash player, Colin West finally accomplished a goal he had been working toward for four years.
At the College Squash Association Individual National Championship Tournament this past weekend, West won his first Individual National Championship and the 33rd title in Crimson history.
“It’s definitely a good way to finish off my career,” West said. “You want to win it for your teammates, you want to win it for Harvard.”
West, a senior and the tournament’s No. 1 seed, defeated Princeton freshman and No. 2 seed Todd Harrity 3-0 in the finals of the Pool Cup division yesterday.
West took a close first game from Princeton’s No. 1 Harrity, 11-9, although he admitted that neither competitor played to his full potential in the opening frame.
“I think we both started off a little bit nervous,” West said.
But during the second game, the match reached the caliber of that of a national championship.
“The second game was where the real thick of the match unfolded,” West said. “He was really in control for most of that game.”
Harrity built up an early 8-5 advantage and had game balls at 10-9 and 11-10, but West was able to save both and win the game 13-11, to take a 2-0 lead.
“The second game was the pivotal point that turned the match totally in Colin’s favor,” said Harvard squash coach Satinder Bajwa.
“[The second game] was the real crux of the match,” West agreed. “Had he won that game, I think it would have ended up being a very different match.”
West easily swept through the third set, winning 11-1 to lock up his first ever national title.
“I was a little bit sharper [in the third],” West said.
Despite the 3-0 score, Harrity pushed West to his limit during the national title match.
“It was a tougher match than the score suggests,” Bajwa said.
West swept through the first two rounds of the tournament relatively easily, although he admitted that his level of play was lower than he would have liked.
“I started off the event a little bit slow,” West said.
On the other hand, Bajwa attributed West’s slow start to the academic pressures placed on any Harvard student-athlete, especially a senior Social Studies concentrator.
“A lot of academic pressure, trying to do a thesis, and all of that were all on Colin’s mind,” Bajwa said. “He was trying to get a good balance between his squash and his thesis.”
Once he reached the later rounds of the tournament, though, West’s play peaked.
“I really saved my better squash for when I needed it,” the senior said.
West took down high-seeded opponents including Trinity’s Vikram Malhotra (No. 8 seed) and Rochester’s Benjamin Fischer (No. 5) in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, without dropping a single game. West also picked up the Skillman Award given to a senior competitor who exhibits sportsmanship throughout his college career. But West was not the only Crimson player to find success at the Individual Championships.
Two other Harvard players, juniors J. Reed Endresen and Richard Hill, also competed in the Pool Division—the top division of the CSA Individual Championships. Both eventually fell to runner-up Harrity.
Endresen put up a good fight in the first round, winning the second game of the match 11-3, but eventually fell 3-1.
“Reed played really well, he mixed the game up a bit,” Bajwa said. “It was a good match for him for the future.”
After falling in the first round, Endresen encountered Cornell’s Alex Domenick in the consolation bracket, but came up short 3-2, which eliminated him from the rest of tournament play.
Hill, also competing in the Pool division, beat the Big Red’s Domenick 3-2 to open tournament play, but couldn’t keep up as Harrity took the second round 3-0.  Hill moved straight into the consolation quarterfinals after his loss, but fell to Yale’s Hywel Robinson, the tournament’s overall No. 7 seed 3-0, ending his tournament run.
MOLLOY DIVISION
In the Molloy division, which serves as the ‘B’ division for the Individual championship, freshman Jason Michas reached the finals before bowing out to Yale’s Chris Plimpton in a close 3-2 match. After a first round bye, Michas beat Scott Phillips of St. Lawrence, 3-2, followed by a 3-2 win against Yale’s Naishadh Lalwani in the round of 16. The Crimson freshman topped Princeton’s Peter Sopher in the quarterfinals, 3-1, before sweeping the Tigers’ Jesus Pena—seeded No. 2 in the division—3-0 to reach the finals.
“Jason has really gotten better each stage of the tournament,” Bajwa said. “He finished off with a very strong showing,”
Freshman Zeke Scherl, the overall No. 4 seed in the Molloy division, earned a first-round bye and cruised through his first match against George Washington’s Omar Sobhy before succumbing to Oscar Lopez in the round of 16, 3-2.  The freshman then moved straight into the consolation quarterfinals, where he beat Rochester’s Matt Domenick 3-2, before falling to Ethan Buchsbaum of Williams in the semifinals, 3-0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The plan was simple.
With the score tied and with 20 seconds left in the game, sophomore point guard Brogan Berry was going to drive, either getting off a shot or finding an open teammate.
The plan was executed to perfection.
Berry drove, only to find a clogged lane in her way. She kicked it back out to junior co-captain Christine Matera, who pump-faked, took one dribble and buried a three, ending Penn’s (1-25, 0-11 Ivy) hopes for an upset bid as the Harvard women’s basketball team escaped Lavietes Pavilion with a 55-52 win on Friday night.
“I saw Brogan penetrate hard, and I replaced behind her,” Matera said. “I just let her know that I was behind her, and she kicked it to me, and I shot it. It felt pretty good.”
“We wanted to use the entire clock; we did not want give the ball back to Penn,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
But the picturesque ending did not match the rest of Harvard’s play, as the home team came out unfocused and slow from the start. The Crimson trailed for much of the first half, and was outworked on the boards, 15-13.
“I think we were a little bit disappointed with the way we came out with our intensity defensively, and rebounding, especially in the first half,” Matera said. “But credit Penn, I thought they played really well defensively and offensively.”
“Penn came out fighting...they brought it tonight,” freshman Victoria Lippert added. “We have to be able to match that, and we didn’t do that right from the start.”
Delaney-Smith admitted that part of the lack of focus might have been due to preoccupation with the game against undefeated Princeton the following night.
“It’s hard to [stay focused] when you know who you have to play tomorrow night, and we need to stop [the Tigers] from being undefeated,” Delaney-Smith said. “Did we overlook Penn? I’m going to have to say we probably did. But we were able to tough it out, and their new coach did a great job with them.”
Lippert led all scorers with 15 points, shooting 7-of-14 from the field. Sophomore guard Caitlin Rowland proved to be a spark plug off the bench, tying a career-high with 11 points, including three three-pointers.
“Caitlin brought a lot of poise off the bench,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought Caitlin did what I wanted the whole team to do. She came out confident, she came out with an attack mentality, and did a great job.”
Rowland scored two of her treys on back-to-back plays in the first half, tightening the game to 18-18. Harvard then took the lead, 21-20, off a jump shot from junior guard Jackie Alemany with 5:39 left in the first frame.
The Quakers would go on a 13-4 run, though, to close out the half with a seven-point lead. Penn shot 52.2 percent from the field in the first half.
“I’ve said all along that Penn is better than their record, and that’s what we saw tonight—they were dangerous,” Delaney-Smith said. “Did I convince my team that they were dangerous? I don’t think so.”
The Crimson and the Quakers would exchange baskets as Penn led for the first ten minutes of the second half. Harvard would finally take the lead at 44-43 off a deep three-pointer from Lippert with 10 minutes remaining in the game.
But the Quakers would respond with a jump shot from senior guard Sarah Bucar. Junior forward Emma Markley then had a layup to retake the lead. Penn would score on three straight possessions to lead, 51-46, with 6:40 left in the game; yet, this would be the last field goal the Quakers would make in the game.
That’s when the Crimson took over.
Lippert scored off a jump shot, and Berry got a steal and fast break layup to bring Harvard within one.
Markley was fouled on a defensive rebound, giving a one-and-one opportunity at the foul line, where the experienced veteran coolly sank both shots.
On the next play, a Harvard foul sent Penn to the line for two free-throw opportunities, leading to a tie game with just 27 seconds left in the contest.
The Crimson would call a timeout with 20 seconds left in the game, leading to the game-winning shot by Matera.
“We had a little luck on our side,” Delaney-Smith said. “We played a little tough in the end. You create your own wins. I’m glad we were able to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—Lockdown—that was the first thing that went through freshman Kyle Casey’s mind after he knocked down two of the biggest free throws of his life.
With Casey’s two free throws, the Harvard men’s basketball team was up by a single point with 11.6 seconds left—just one defensive stop away from earning its 21st victory of the season.
And with the help of classmate Brandyn Curry, Casey was able to secure that victory by stopping one of the Ivy League’s most prolific scorers to keep Penn (5-21, 4-8 Ivy) off the scoreboard on its final possession and give the Crimson (21-6, 10-3 Ivy) the win, 67-66.
Quakers guard Zack Rosen—who entered the contest averaging 17.8 points per game—was the most likely candidate to take Penn’s final shot. Rosen received the inbounds pass and sped up the court guarded closely by Curry. As the seconds ticked away, Rosen used a screen at the top of the key in an attempt to get free from Curry.
But the 6’7” Casey switched onto Rosen immediately and forced the lefty sniper to give the ball up to center Mike Howlett on the perimeter with three seconds left. Howlett took two dribbles toward the basket, then let fly a fadeaway jumper from the left elbow that clanged off the back iron.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin knocked the rebound away as the clock expired and Harvard escaped with the victory.
“Brandyn and I had pretty much been guarding the pick and role the whole game together,” Casey said. “We just looked at each other and reinforced each other and said, ‘let’s lockdown, and let’s get this stop.’”
But just moments before Howlett’s shot deflected off the rim, few could have even imagined that Harvard would find itself in a position to win the contest.
After Rosen knocked down a free throw with 2:06 remaining, the Quakers sported a four-point lead on their home floor.
But costly Penn turnovers combined with aggressive defense from Harvard’s freshman class would equal success for the Crimson.
“I was very pleased with our defensive energy late in the game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We had to come up with some stops and some steals and create some havoc there at the end to give ourselves a chance.”
After Rosen’s free throw, Lin worked with the ball on the left wing. Drawing the defense’s attention, Lin zipped a pass to Curry, who popped open at the top of the key. The freshman received the pass and in one motion let the shot go. When the ball sailed through the net, the Crimson trailed just 66-65.
Rookie Christian Webster forced Rosen to cough it up on Penn’s next possession, and Webster quickly looked up the court to find Lin streaking to the basket. Webster sent the pass to Lin, who pulled down the ball. After being knocked to the ground by a Penn defender, Lin looked for the foul call but was instead whistled for a travel.
The Quakers would return the ball to Crimson on their next possession, though, when Harvard’s defense forced Jack Eggleston to sail a pass out of bounds with 1:10 left.
Lin then attempted to take the ball to the basket but was stripped entering the paint. Sophomore Keith Wright retained the Harvard possession, diving to the floor to force a jump ball. With the possession arrow facing the Crimson bench, Harvard drew up an inbounds play for Curry. But the point guard was forced to rush his shot with just five seconds left on the shot clock and his layup attempt went off target.
Following Curry’s miss, Penn held onto the ball with the lead and 36 seconds left.
The Crimson would utilize its aggressive defense to force one more turnover, this time courtesy of Howlett, who threw the ball out of bounds trying to find his point guard.
With his team still trailing by one, Lin took the ball again. But this time, Lin found Casey open on the left elbow. Casey faked a shot and then looked for Curry in the corner, but before he could let the pass go, Dan Monckton was whistled for the foul on Casey.
With 11.6 on the clock, Casey coolly sank both shots from the charity stripe, setting up the final defensive stop.
“I just went to the line, did my routine, and knocked them down,” Casey said.
Harvard, which led by as many as nine in the first half, saw its lead dwindle in the minutes before and after the break. Behind 5-of-7 three-point shooting from sophomore Rob Belcore, the Quakers were able to turn a five-point deficit into a one-point lead just over six minutes into the second frame.
“[Belcore] making shots gave us a chance to win the game,” said Penn interim coach Jerome Allen. “Overall offensively we didn’t do a good job of executing and to Rob’s credit, he made some tough shots for us.”
The Penn lead would grow to as many as seven with less than five minutes remaining before Curry and Casey combined for their team’s final 11 points, leading the Crimson on an 11-3 run to claim the victory.
“It was definitely a gutsy win,” Casey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a four-game losing streak, the Harvard men’s hockey team was in desperate need of a rapid turnaround to save its season this weekend. That turnaround began on Friday, when the Crimson recovered from a two-goal third period deficit to defeat Princeton in the first game of the ECAC playoffs, 4-2.
The Tigers outshot Harvard in the first two periods, but the Crimson rebounded in the final period to even the shot count at 35 apiece.
“I think it was pretty evenly matched the whole game,” senior Doug Rogers said. “We had our opportunities, Princeton had theirs. We thought we were playing well and realized we needed to be urgent. I think we came out a little harder in the third and pressed offensively.”
Princeton, the eighth seed playing at home against ninth-seeded Harvard, took the lead to start the game. At 15:27 into the first period, Tiger Dan Bartlett collected the puck in his defensive zone and made a break down ice toward the Harvard net. With the Crimson defense converging on him, Bartlett sent a cross-ice pass to a wide-open Matt Godlewski at the blue line. Godlewski then ripped a slapshot, which was redirected past Harvard junior goaltender Kyle Richter by Marc Hagel, who was left alone in front of goal.
The Tigers extended their lead to 2-0 in the second period off a goal by Mark Magnowski. The forward beat a Crimson defender on the left side of the ice and attempted a centering pass to an open teammate in front of the crease. Though Harvard captain Alex Biega slid and blocked the pass, Magnowski recollected the puck behind the goal and backhanded it off of Richter and in for the score.
But through two periods, Princeton goalie Zane Kalemba and his defense stumped the Crimson, keeping the squad off the scoreboard. Kalemba saved 31 shots on the night, while at the other end of the ice, Richter made 33 saves.
Both teams were blanked on the power play with Harvard going 0-for-5 and Princeton scoreless in four opportunities.
With 12 minutes left in the third period, sophomore Daniel Moriarty finally opened the Harvard scoring to start the Harvard comeback. After Moriarty caused a turnover in the Tigers’ defensive zone, junior Pier-Olivier Michaud collected the puck and sent a shot on net. Moriarty, having moved in front of the crease, positioned himself and deflected the Michaud shot past Kalemba.
Just over two minutes later, freshman defenseman Danny Biega evened the game after going five-hole on a distracted Kalemba. Four minutes after that, junior Michael Del Mauro registered the game-winner when he corralled senior Jack Christian’s blocked shot and sent the puck between the Princeton pipes.
“I think there’s something to be said for momentum,” Rogers said. “We scored our first one and got two quick ones after that. I think they kind of built off each other.”
Junior Michael Biega ended the scoring with two minutes left to play to make the final score 4-2.
“Friday was a great game for us in terms of adversity, facing adversity,” Alex Biega said. “We were down 2-0 in the third, [and] our team came back and stuck to the game plan. We never got discouraged but kept going.”
Although the squad developed momentum during Friday’s game, Harvard lacked momentum coming into the contest. The Crimson was on a 2-9 slide before the weekend series.
“I think definitely because it’s the playoffs, you’re in a do-or-die situation,” Rogers said. “We thought we played good hockey [last weekend], we just had to sharpen up a little bit and cut down on mistakes at crucial points, and I think we did that.”
As it moves forward in the postseason, the squad will try to recreate the complete team performance of this weekend. In Friday’s game, 12 Harvard skaters registered points, and the Crimson is currently on a 7-0 unanswered goal streak.
“At this point it’s do or die...I think this team is capable of doing wonderful things,” Biega said. “I’ve said it from the get go. We look at the playoffs as another season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team received little southern hospitality this weekend on its trip to Baltimore, Md.
Taking on perennial powerhouse Johns Hopkins (3-2), the Crimson (1-1) came out flat on Saturday and was not able to recover from an early deficit, eventually falling to the Blue Jays, 15-10.
“I think it was just a frustrating game for everybody,” said sophomore Melanie Baskind, who led her team with four goals. “We didn’t really execute our game plan and got ourselves in a hole pretty early.”
But despite falling behind, 12-5, in the first half, Harvard came out on a tear to begin the second, netting four goals in 10 minutes to cut the deficit to three.
Junior Jess Halpern, the reigning Ivy League leader in goals scored, got things started, notching her first goal of the season five minutes into the period.
Baskind followed with her third goal of the game, this time taking a pass from freshman Danielle Tetreault and beating Johns Hopkins goalie Larash Cosette.
After being held to just a single shot over the first 90 minutes of the season, Halpern scored her second goal in three minutes, taking it unassisted for the score.
Less than a minute later, Baskind added her fourth score of the game, and suddenly the Crimson was within striking distance.
“We kind of decided that as a team we were going to pull it together and come back—and we almost did,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said.
But the comeback was not to be.
The Blue Jays clamped down defensively, holding Harvard to a single score over the next 21:25 of play. Johns Hopkins also found its offensive stride again, netting three scores to close the game.
Blue Jay senior Candace Rossi accumulated her ninth point of the game, finding teammate Colleen McCaffrey to make it 14-10 with seven minutes to play.
But like the rest of her team, Rossi did most of her damage in the opening frame. Rossi found teammate Paige Ibello for the score to open the game. The Crimson kept pace, as VanderMeulen answered with a goal to even the score.
But McCaffrey and Rossi followed up with two score apiece, putting their team up, 5-2.
Baskind responded with her first collegiate score, but the Blue Jays went on a 4-0 run behind two more goals from Rossi and eventually went into the break leading, 12-5.
“Hopkins is obviously a very talented team,” said VanderMeulen, who finished with one goal on four shots. “I thought we came out a little timid and that hurt us in the first half.”
Part of the Crimson’s struggles resulted from trying to adjust to the aggressive style of play Johns Hopkins employed. The Blue Jays defenders doubled the Harvard attackers, making it difficult to find an open path to the goal.
Senior goalkeeper Katherine Martino picked up her first loss of the season in net, finishing with seven saves while allowing 15 goals.
One bright spot for the Crimson was the play of Baskind, a soccer standout who made her debut on the lacrosse field this season.
After tallying an assist in her first game, Baskind added four scores in her second game, helping to keep Harvard within striking distance.
“Mel was hustling all over the field today,” VanderMeulen said. “She really helped us all over the field.”
In addition to her four scores, Baskind caused four turnovers and won three draw controls. But despite her strong individual performance, the midfielder remained disappointed with the contest.
“You can’t really be too happy when the team doesn’t do well, but hopefully it’s a sign of things to come,” Baskind said.
Although the Crimson will return north, the team will still have to find away to win on the road, as its next two contests will take place outside of Cambridge.
“We need to come out stronger,” Baskind said. “The beginning of the game is very important—we definitely saw that [Saturday].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Holy Cross Crusaders (0-4) took an early 4-1 lead on the No. 11 Harvard men’s lacrosse team (2-1) this past Saturday, it seemed as though the usual spark between Crimson players was less than a glimmer and hopes for a victory were dim. But an late offensive charge, coupled with a refocused defense that allowed only three goals in the final three quarters, pushed Harvard to a gritty 9-7 victory over the Crusaders.
The Crimson met Bay State rival Holy Cross Saturday afternoon at Holy Cross Field in front of nearly 600 fans. Harvard was coming off of an emotional road matchup against the No. 14 Georgetown Hoyas on Wednesday that was a constant battle for the lead, but ultimately left the Crimson one goal short of victory.
Harvard jumped out to a 1-0 lead against the Crusaders, scoring after only 1:01 of play with a goal by senior attack Jason Duboe. But aside from Duboe’s early tally, Holy Cross dominated the rest of the first quarter, netting four goals in just over three minutes of play.
“I don’t know if it was actually the physical exhaustion [from our game against Georgetown] or what,” senior defenseman Ben Smith said. “But we definitely came out a little flatter, and we weren’t following the game plan as well as we should have.”
Harvard finally responded to the Crusaders’ onslaught of goals when sophomore attack Jeff Cohen scored with 6:42 on the clock. Then, with less than a minute to go in the first quarter, junior attack Dean Gibbons added his first of what would be four goals in the game, bringing the Crimson to within one of Holy Cross. Harvard battled back to end the quarter down just 4-3.
“The coaching staff stayed positive,” Duboe said. “They basically told us, ‘This isn’t going to be easy, and the magic isn’t there today. So, you’re basically going to have to grind out a win, and that’s just the way it is.’”
Cohen and Gibbons continued to spearhead Harvard’s offense in the second quarter. Cohen first tallied a goal with 11:42 to go. Senior attack Travis Burr joined in the scoring action as well, adding a goal of his own with 9:10 left in the quarter. Gibbons then sent two shots past the Crusader goalie, scoring first with 2:24 to go and then again with just one second left in the half.
“When our offense plays together, everyone is moving the ball, and we just follow the game plan,” Smith said. “Nobody is trying to be selfish or do it themselves—opportunities pop up. Dean and Jeff and Jason are all very opportunistic players, and when they get those opportunities, good things will happen.”
In the second quarter, the Crimson defense dug its heels in a little deeper against what had been an aggressive Holy Cross attack in the first. The Harvard defense held Holy Cross scoreless in the second quarter and ended the half with a 7-4 lead.
“Our defense did a good job of playing very successfully and getting balls off of the ground,” Duboe said.  “This just gave us [on offense] some more opportunities with the ball.”
After the first quarter the Crimson defense—led by freshman goalie Harry Krieger, who made his first collegiate start against Holy Cross—held the Crusaders to only three goals in the remaining three quarters of play. Krieger made seven saves in the win, while Smith, senior defenseman Billy Geist, freshman midfielder Jeff Molinari and freshman midfielder Alex White each picked up three ground balls to keep the offensive motion heading upfield.
“[Holy Cross] had been getting a lot of shots from right in the middle, at the crease, which puts our goalie in a tough spot when they’re only shooting from three yards away,” Smith said. “We started making them take some outside shots, started playing each man up more, and causing some turnovers that then gave our offense opportunities.”
Holy Cross attack Chris Smirti opened the second half with two goals, but sophomore Terry White and Gibbons responded for the Crimson with a tally each before the end of the third quarter.
Entering the final quarter of play, Harvard held a three-goal advantage over Holy Cross, 9-6. The Crusaders would add just one more goal before the end of the game, allowing Harvard to hang onto a 9-7 victory despite not scoring in the fourth quarter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge felt the first rays of spring this past weekend, the Harvard women’s water polo team received a colder welcome in Indianapolis at the Elite Eight Tournament, where the Crimson (8-5) dropped its first two matches against Maryland (8-5) and No. 20 Princeton (7-3) on Saturday. Things warmed up as Harvard rebounded yesterday, defeating Bucknell (5-5) in overtime after having lost to the Bison last weekend.
“This weekend, our first two games were very close, but we just couldn’t pull out the win,” freshman Aisha Price said. “This third game, we really put our heads into coming out with the win and went into the game just ready to give it our all. We are just really really happy that we are able to come out finally with a good win.”
This win was especially important for the Crimson which, without it, would have faced a 7-6 overall record going into the spring break stretch. Over the next two weeks, Harvard will see game time against six different California schools.
HARVARD 13, BUCKNELL 12
After a three-game losing skid, Sunday’s win was a relief for the Crimson squad.
“We just wanted to play our game, and we knew we would have to just get it done,” Price said.
In the first eight-minute period, both squads went on an offensive rampage, scoring nine goals total with the Bison having a 5-4 lead. The next quarter showed Bucknell taking charge, outscoring the Crimson, 3-1, to lead, 8-5, at halftime.
Down for the third time in as many games, Harvard scored four goals during the third period while holding the Bison to one sole tally and tying the game at nine. Both teams found the back of the net twice in the fourth quarter, forcing overtime.
Sophomore Devan Kennifer, who had a season-high six tallies, gave the Crimson a 13-11 cushion as the final minutes ticked down, and even with a Bucknell goal, the squad managed to hold on for a tight 13-12 win. Sophomore goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy made seven saves to seal Harvard’s come-from-behind victory.
“In that game, we were pretty tired from the day, before but we really didn’t want to lose,” Kennifer said. “We didn’t feel that we had played very well the week before, and we would have liked to beat them [then], so I think we just had an extra gear that we reached for to pull it into overtime and [played] those extra six minutes as hard as we could.”
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 6
The evening before, Harvard faced a tough opponent in Ivy rival and No. 20 Princeton, one of the only ranked teams at the invitational.
The game began with the Crimson and the Tigers trading tallies. Tied at two after the first period, Harvard scored one goal less than Princeton in the next two quarters. The Crimson’s fall came in the final eight minutes, as the Tigers recorded six tallies while Harvard could not complete a shot.
“We put up some good fights, and based on our trends, we have very good heart in coming back from deficits,” Kennifer said. “We are not afraid to keep fighting even if we are down, but I also think we have things we know we have to work on to come out on top in this game.”
Sophomore Ita Barton-Kettleborough completed her second hat trick of the day, but even with McCarthy stopping seven of Princeton’s attempts, the scoreless final period prevented the Crimson from grabbing another win.
MARYLAND 13, HARVARD 10
The first matchup of the weekend proved a battle to the finish as the Harvard squad managed to come from behind and create a 7-7 tie going into the final quarter.
“In the Maryland game, we were down, 6-3, and we came back to tie it, and we could have just rolled over at that point,” Kennifer said. “They were seeded above us, and we could have just been happy with that, but we weren’t. We came back and really made a run for it.”
Three Crimson athletes—Kennifer, Barton-Kettleborough, and Price—all produced hat tricks as Harvard’s offense came out hard, but the Terrapins outscored the Crimson, 6-3, in the final period to take the victory.
“Definitely give Maryland the respect,” Price said. “It was a close game. We just couldn’t pull out with the win this time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s hockey team has had its fair share of troubles throughout its season, it proved this weekend that it can win when it counts, sweeping Princeton (12-16-3) in the ECAC Hockey first-round playoff series.
After a 4-2 comeback victory on Friday, the Crimson continued its dominant performance on Saturday in a 3-0 shutout win.
Sophomore Daniel Moriarty and freshmen Danny Biega and Luke Greiner each logged a goal for Harvard, while junior goaltender Kyle Richter posted 37 saves to preserve the sweep.
“Obviously, we’ve had a bumpy road in regular season,” captain Alex Biega said, “but we look at playoffs as a brand-new season.”
The Crimson (9-19-3) finished its regular season on a pair of one-goal losses to St. Lawrence and Clarkson on the road.
Fortunately, Harvard was able to find the back of the net in the Princeton series and hold its lead for the entirety of the game.
Before the decisive third period, Princeton had claimed most of the momentum of the early half of the game.
“Princeton kind of took it to us a little bit early in the game and early parts of the second period,” senior Doug Rogers said. “We were confident that no matter how long it took we would score eventually.”
And score they did.
The first goal of the game came from Moriarty off of a Crimson power play after two scoreless periods. The sophomore capitalized off of passes from junior Michael Biega and freshman Louis Leblanc to put the puck behind Tigers’ goaltender Zane Kalemba.
Just over seven minutes later, Danny Biega secured the Harvard lead with another goal. Biega was able to take control of a high pass from Greiner and beat a duo of Princeton defenders to put the puck between the pipes with a backhanded shot.
It was the fourth goal in five games for the rookie, who has eight points on the season.
Biega returned the favor for Greiner with just over a minute remaining in the game, sending a pass to the freshman for an empty-net goal. Kalemba, who recorded 14 saves on the game, had been substituted for an additional offensive player.
The real standout performance of the night came from Richter, whose goalkeeping upheld not only the victory but also the shutout, the fifth of his career. The junior logged 33 saves on Friday night and 37 on Saturday, allowing only two goals on the weekend and none in the final four periods of the series.
Richter earned All-Ivy League honorable mention honors for posting a .924 save percentage in Ancient Eight play, saving 121 of 131 shots. On Saturday, Richter proved his worth with a shutout in the midst of a shot differential skewed to the Tigers’ side. Princeton took 37 shots to the Crimson’s 17, a statistic that exemplifies talented goalkeeping and effective shooting.
“Obviously, Kyle Richter played incredible [this weekend],” Rogers said. “He made some great saves for us.”
This is the first time Harvard has defeated the Tigers this season, after a 3-3 overtime tie in November and a 2-1 loss at the end of January.
The difference for the Crimson is consistency, the ability to play a full three-period game rather than a match of shining moments and mental breakdowns.
“[Tonight] our team really bought into the system...and followed it consistently whatever the score was,” Biega said. “I think we’ve really started to play 60 minutes and are sticking collectively to our strategy.”
Although Harvard has had an unpredictable season, it exemplified this weekend that it may be reaching its potential. After streaks of wins and losses throughout the season, perhaps it has found a working strategy.
“I think this team is capable of doing wonderful things,” Biega said. “The key is just to show up every night...and leave everything on the ice.”
The Crimson may have only survived the first round of ECAC play, but the sweep provided it with not only two victories, but also momentum moving forward in the postseason. Harvard will hit the road again next weekend to play ***RESULT***
“I think our mindset going forward is a confident one,” Rogers said. “If we bring our best and smartest effort, we can beat everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another year, another conference semifinal nailbiter. And unfortunately for the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team, it was left looking at a 3-2 loss for the second year in a row.
The Crimson (20-7-5) surrendered a late-game goal to end its bid for an ECAC tournament title Friday night, as No. 6 Clarkson (23-11-5) skated away with the win at Cheel Arena.
Golden Knight Gabrielle Kosziwka found the back of the net with 2:07 to play to send her Clarkson squad to its first-ever conference championship.
“It was a great hockey game just to be a part of,” junior Kate Buesser said. “It’s really tough that we came out on the losing end, because I know everyone worked really hard and put a lot of effort in.”
With a trip to the ECAC finals on the line—and important NCAA implications for both teams—Harvard and the Golden Knights both had trouble getting settled in the game’s opening minutes.
The Crimson got the first shot on goal just under three minutes in, but Clarkson netminder Lauren Dahm made the easy save. And although Harvard held the Golden Knights shotless for the first six minutes of the game, Clarkson capitalized on its first opportunity.
Daris Tendler took a pass from Juana Baribeau high in the slot and launched the puck towards the net. Though Crimson rookie goalie Laura Bellamy was in position for the save, the shot deflected off her glove and into the back of the net.
Harvard was only narrowly outshot in the first frame, 6-5, but it skated into the break facing a 1-0 deficit.
“In the first [period]...everyone was kind of holding their stick a little bit too tight,” Buesser said. “Just the atmosphere—playing in a big arena with a lot of people there.”
But when the puck dropped to start the second period, the Crimson team responded with renewed energy.
Though the Golden Knight defense held up to Harvard’s early pressure—including a key stop from Dahm on a shot off the stick of senior Randi Griffin—Buesser broke through nine minutes into the frame.
In the midst of a line change, Buesser charged the net and tipped in a pass from freshman Josephine Pucci to even the score at one. Junior Deborah Conway was credited with the secondary assist.
“The line in front of me had been working really well,” Buesser explained. “Pucci just made a beautiful pass through everyone, and it was a little bit in front of me, so I had to throw my stick out there.”
With the game tied and the Crimson in control, Clarkson resorted to sloppy defense.
“We came out and played our game and were on our toes,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “As a result, we drew some penalties and capitalized on a power play.”
After Baribeau and Tegan Schroder were whistled for consecutive penalties at 13:01 and 13:29, the Crimson set up on a 5-on-3 advantage. Forty seconds later, freshman Jillian Dempsey won a faceoff and passed the puck back to senior Anna McDonald.
McDonald put a shot on net, and though Dahm made the initial save, junior Liza Ryabkina scooped up the rebound to make it a 2-1 game.
The Golden Knights settled down to knot the score again three minutes later on an unassisted tally from Brittany Mulligan. After making a defensive stop, Mulligan beat out two defenders to backhand the puck into the top right corner of the net.
Just like that, the momentum was back in the hands of Clarkson as the squads headed into the break.
The Golden Knights pressured Bellamy in an early-period power play, but the rookie stood up to the test, making three saves on the penalty kill. Bellamy finished with 19 saves.
Harvard had its chances in the third, putting seven shots on net, but with the clock winding down and overtime looming, Clarkson found a way to light the lamp.
“It’s just the fight that’s in that team,” Buesser said. “They were playing for their season there...They have a lot of great personalities on that team, and they just never go away.”
After the Golden Knights won a faceoff, Katelyn Ptolemy took a hard slapshot from the top of the zone.
Kosziwka was there to push the puck between Bellamy’s legs and give the home team the lead—the third time this season that Clarkson has staged a late-game comeback against the Crimson.
“Sometimes it’s a lot of luck,” Stone said. “I think we can do a better job closing out periods and closing out games...but again, hockey’s so free-flowing that momentum swings [matter]. Good teams don’t go away easily, and they’re a good team.”
Stone pulled Bellamy with 1:08 to play, but Harvard couldn’t find the equalizer. Clarkson advanced to the championship game, where it fell, 4-3, to Cornell in overtime—giving the Big Red the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
Harvard received an at-large bid to the national tournament and was named the No. 4 seed last night. It will host Cornell in the quarterfinals this weekend.
“You have to give [Clarkson] a lot of respect for how hard they worked,” Buesser said. “It’s nothing we can hold our heads down about—we can’t feel bad about how we played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard baseball team went two-for-three in its opening weekend, most of its current starters were in high school.
After a weekend in DeLand, Fla. at the Bright House Invitational, the Crimson (2-1) took home more wins in one Saturday than the 2008 and ’09 squads captured in both of their opening weekends put together.
“We definitely came out ready to play,” sophomore pitcher Brent Suter said. “We had a winning mindset.”
KANSAS STATE 6, HARVARD 1
Opening weekend optimism wasn’t enough against a top-heavy Wildcats batting order—especially junior Carter Jurica—who had four RBI for Kansas State.
“We didn’t beat ourselves,” Suter said. “We just ran into a really good ball club.”
Early in the game, Harvard seemed poised to take its third victory of the weekend. Sophomore second baseman Jeff Reynolds hit a home run in the top of the first and junior pitcher Eric Eadington held the Wildcats without a run in his first two innings back from an injury.
“It was good to be out there again,” Eadington said, “good to be healthy again.”
But Reynolds’ home run was all the offense the Crimson would get on Sunday. Kansas State would hit its stride soon enough, and Jurica’s two-run single in the third shifted the scoreboard in the Wildcats’ favor.
But the score stayed close for two more innings, and Eadington, who took the loss, left the game after the fifth with Harvard only down by one.
“I thought Eadington pitched really well,” Walsh said. “‘Boomer’ as we call him—flashing our upper-80 fastball.”
But Jurica struck again in the seventh with a two-run homer. The long ball proved to be the back-breaker for the Crimson, which allowed four runs in the inning en route to its first loss of the season.
HARVARD 6, STETSON 5
Fresh off its first season-opening win since 2007, the Crimson batters didn’t miss a beat against the Hatters, notching two runs in each of the first three innings to take a 6-1 lead that would withstand a late Stetson rally.
Junior Dillon O’Neill had the Hatters concerned early as he stole third base before a catcher error allowed the outfielder to find home plate.
Freshman Dan Moskovits sent Reynolds home on the next play, and before long, the Crimson held a commanding five-run lead.
But the Hatters kept creeping back into the game, reducing Harvard’s lead to one run with two innings to play.
After sophomore left-hander Jonah Klees held Stetson off through the eighth inning, and through two outs and two strikes in the ninth, all he had to do was pitch one last strike.
Klees did just that, inducing a swing, but the throw slipped through junior catcher Tyler Albright’s fingers, allowing the Hatter to advance to first base.
“Tyler Albright had played spectacularly all game, blowing guys out,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “The ball trickled off Tyler’s glove. Now it’s two outs with the bases loaded.”
But Albright was spared punishment for his error as the next Stetson batter popped a fly ball to center, which O’Neill corralled easily.
HARVARD 9, NOTRE DAME 6
When Zach Hofeld allowed three runs in the top of the first inning, it looked to be a rough start to a new season.
“It kind of felt like games last year,” Suter said.
But by the end of the inning, the tide of the game had turned as the Crimson offense kicked off a new decade of baseball with five runs in the bottom of the first.
“We were hitting line drives all over the place,” Walsh said. “We came out hustling and getting aggressive, and next thing you know, our bats were alive.”
But replacing Hofeld with sophomore Conner Hulse couldn’t stop the offensive outpouring on both sides, and the Fighting Irish quickly tied the game back up with two runs in the second.
Hulse finally stayed Notre Dame’s bats in the top of the third, holding his opponent to one run over the next six innings.
The sophomore had seven strikeouts on the game.
“Conner did an outstanding job,” Walsh said.
And in the bottom of the third, Harvard swung itself to a three run lead from which the Fighting Irish would never be able to recover, as the Crimson stormed out to a 1-0 record for the first time since 2007.
“It was a good weekend for Crimson baseball,” Walsh said. “Offensively, defensively, pitching, I thought we played pretty well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team (2-3) left its first preseason tournament with essentially the same answers and questions it had at the beginning of the year.
Sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown was one of those answers, pitching the Crimson to its only two victories of the University of Central Florida Invitational in Orlando, Fla. this weekend. One of the questions for Harvard was how it would score the runs to win games behind its great pitching. That question still remains unanswered, as the Crimson lost a pair of games on Saturday in which it allowed a combined eight hits.
Harvard opened the tournament with an impressive 1-0 win over Georgia Southern (10-6) on Friday, but followed by getting blanked, 9-0, by host UCF (11-8). The Crimson lost a pair of tough games on Saturday to Providence (5-11) and the College of Charleston (6-11) before rebounding yesterday to close out the tournament with a decisive 4-0 shutout of in-state rival Boston College (8-6).
“Rachel had an exceptional start, but the story of the tournament was [that] we had great pitching in four of our games, but the hitting couldn’t come through to win the games for us,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “So we had a team meeting on Saturday, and we came out on fire today, we scored, and we got key hits.”
HARVARD 4, BOSTON COLLEGE 0
Brown pitched a complete-game three-hitter and added nine strikeouts to help the Crimson earn a sweet end to its first preseason tournament of the year. Timely hitting proved key for Harvard, as the team opened the first inning with two runs on three hits and was 4-for-8 with runners in scoring position. Senior Jennifer Francis led the way with a pair of RBI.
“The sun was shining, and we were out there hitting the ball hard right from the first inning,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “That definitely set the tone for our entire season, and that’s the way we want to play every day.”
COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON 1, HARVARD 0
Freshman pitcher Jess Ferri allowed a leadoff double in the top of the first before sending the runner home on a fielding error to give the Cougars the only run of the game. Ferri rebounded to pitch two-hit ball over the next 5.1 innings, but the Crimson couldn’t string hits together and only managed three hits and six baserunners in the game.
Harvard had its best chance to even the ledger when sophomore shortstop Jane Alexander led off the third with a triple to center field. After a groundout, freshman outfielder Ashley Heritage walked and stole second, but the Crimson lined out and struck out to end both the inning and the only real threat of the game.
PROVIDENCE 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard took a 1-0 lead in the top of the second when sophomore pinch-runner Eve Rosenbaum advanced to third on a wild pitch and senior Stephanie Krysiak batted her home with a two-out RBI single up the middle. Sophomore pitcher Julia Moore pitched four innings of one-hit ball, but gave up two runs in the fourth on a walk, triple, and wild pitch.
The Friars added an insurance run in the sixth, but the Crimson had a great chance to do some damage in the top of the seventh. After Alexander singled to right and advanced to second on a groundout, Krysiak singled to left and stole second, leaving runners on second and third with only one out. In what would become a trend for Harvard Saturday, a groundout followed by a strikeout ended the game and secured the victory for Providence.
CENTRAL FLORIDA 9, HARVARD 0
The host Golden Knights spoiled Ferri’s first collegiate start and took care of business in only five innings. The game remained scoreless through the first two innings until Ferri walked four of the first five batters she faced in the third. After a two-RBI single, Ferri’s first day as a Crimson pitcher was done after only 2.1 innings of work.
HARVARD 1, GEORGIA SOUTHERN 0
Brown, the reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year, did what seems to be automatic for her, as she gave up only three hits in eight innings of work to help Harvard sneak by Georgia Southern, 1-0.
In the bottom of the eighth inning, Heritage was placed on second and advanced to third after a Krysiak groundout. Macadam followed by knocking one to shortstop that was mishandled just long enough for Heritage to come home and seal the opener for the Crimson.
“[Rachel] has the poise and confidence of a seasoned veteran,” Black said. “She dominates out there, and she’s very mentally tough. Even if her arm is fatigued, she’s so strong mentally that she can just get through a game like that no problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—The Harvard men’s basketball team has proven its ability to win when co-captain Jeremy Lin isn’t on his game. But when its second option is also struggling, the Crimson’s chances for victory drop dramatically, especially on the road.
Such was the case Saturday night at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium, where the top two stars for both teams had off nights.
In the final conference game of his career, Lin was held to eight points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field. Though he did go 5-of-6 from the free-throw line, the vaunted guard’s only made basket from the floor was a three-pointer late in the first half.
With his mid-range game not working, the senior did not convert any of the seven two-point shots he put up.
Lin’s biggest miss of the game came with 16 seconds left, when his potential game-winning layup bounced off the iron on Harvard’s penultimate offensive possession.
And for the second straight night, freshman Kyle Casey struggled mightily. After only committing one personal foul in the first half, he picked up four in the final frame, fouling out with 3:37 left to play.
Casey scored just five points on 2-of-6 shooting—including two missed three-pointers—to go along with a team-high four turnovers.
Whether it was making passes or receiving them, the rookie simply never looked comfortable and had his hands full on the defensive end guarding Princeton’s versatile front-court.
“If your top scorers aren’t having good offensive games, there’s no question that affects how we play and the rhythm of the game offensively,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Nonetheless we still have to find ways [to win].”
The Tigers experienced similar problems with their standouts.
Sophomore Doug Davis, Princeton’s leading scorer, encountered shooting problems all game, missing all but two of the 11 shots he attempted from the field in 35 minutes of action. From teardrops to triples, the speedster couldn’t get much to fall.
Forward Dan Mavraides—just behind Davis in scoring average—received two quick fouls in the first half and was never a real factor, adding only five points and a rebound. The junior had shredded Harvard for a team-high 14 points back in early February at Lavietes Pavilion.
LIVING THE DREAM
Luckily for the Tigers, a reserve stepped up in a big way.
Junior Kareem Maddox came off the bench to collect a career-high 18 points, going 10-for-11 from the charity stripe. An extremely athletic 6’8” forward, Maddox made a big impact on both ends of the floor with his strength and quickness, which allowed him to post up or drive the baseline on a consistent basis.
The Crimson attempted to slow the big man with a variety of defenders—including Casey, sophomore Keith Wright, and Lin—but had little success. Three of Casey’s fouls came when guarding Maddox, and Wright experienced difficulties keeping up with the junior as well. When faced with Harvard’s wings, Maddox used his body to either convert inside or get to the free throw line.
“The kid Maddox is such a tough player, a tough guard,” Amaker said. “If you got a big guy on him, he’s really good with the ball, and if you try to go a little smaller to stay in front of him, he goes into the post.”
The impressive performance came as no surprise, considering that Maddox tore apart the Crimson to the tune of 14 points in the teams’ previous matchup last month.
Maddox received no breathers on the defensive end, as he was assigned the duty of guarding Lin. With the help of Princeton’s team defense, Maddox was able to hassle the headliner and keep him off-balance.
“His length is something we don’t have at any other spot,” Tigers coach Sidney Johnson said. “Kareem is long and able to disturb people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a season of firsts for wrestling co-captain J.P. O’Connor. The fourth-year grappler is ranked first in the nation, he’s climbing ever closer to first all-time in wins at Harvard, and he just took home his first-ever EIWA championship.
After reaching the finals of the conference tournament for the fourth-straight year, O’Connor (157 lbs.) finally had his hand raised at the 106th EIWA Championships in Lehigh’s Stabler Arena yesterday, as the senior defeated Bryce Saddoris of Navy, 3-1.
“To be honest, it feels like a big weight off of my shoulders,” O’Connor said. “It definitely feels good. It’s nice to get the big hardware instead of the little guy they give you for second place.”
O’Connor was not the only Crimson grappler to make it to the podium, though, as co-captain Louis Caputo and freshman Steven Keith also enjoyed standout tournaments. The three wrestlers who have shouldered much of the load for Harvard all season took the opportunity to shine on the individual stage, taking first, second, and third in their respective weight classes.
Keith (125) had one of the most challenging roads through the championships, as the rookie entered the tournament unseeded. The young grappler cruised through his first bout, besting Columbia’s Kyle Gilchrist, 8-2, to set up a battle with reigning national champion Troy Nickerson. The Cornell standout showed no mercy as he earned a fall in 2:46, but Keith proved undeterred. The freshman stormed through the consolation bracket, winning four more matches to take third place.
“I could talk for hours about how great [Keith] wrestled,” O’Connor said. “I can’t believe how much confidence he showed. He killed everyone on his way back [through the bracket].”
And perhaps none of Keith’s performances was more dominant than his last, in which a trip to the NCAA championships was on the line. Needing a win to qualify, Keith owned the third-place bout against No. 2 seed Joseph Langel, earning a 16-0 technical fall and a ticket to Omaha.
“Steven proved a lot to me today,” Weiss said. “He had no fear. He got taken down a couple times in matches but did what he needed to do. I’m not going to be surprised if he’s on the podium [at nationals].”
While Keith was busy fighting his way back, Caputo and O’Connor continued to dominate their respective weights. Caputo won his preliminary and quarterfinal bouts by eight points each, showing poise in his final conference competition. But a matchup with Lehigh’s David Craig in front of a hostile crowd would test anyone’s nerves. Caputo rose to the challenge, besting his longtime rival 3-1 to earn a spot in the finals.
“Louis had a great tournament,” O’Connor said. “He had a big, emotional win in the semis.”
Unfortunately for Caputo, the finals would not prove as satisfying. The sixth-ranked grappler in the nation faced difficult competition from No. 4 Michael Cannon of American University, and the Crimson senior fell, 5-1.
“I didn’t reach my goal, so I’m a little disappointed,” Caputo said. “I wrestled tentatively in the finals, but overall I’m thrilled to go back to the NCAA tournament. I just have some things to work on.”
O’Connor also felt that he did not have an ideal tournament, but a lack of offense did not stop the All-American from going undefeated in Bethlehem, Pa. O’Connor rolled through his first two bouts with a major decision and a technical fall before running into trouble in the semifinals. The Harvard co-captain took on Daryl Cocozzo of Rutgers and immediately found himself in unfamiliar territory, as Cocozzo notched an early takedown for a 2-0 lead. O’Connor kept his cool, though, and quickly turned the match around for a 4-2 advantage. After sealing the seminfinal bout, 6-2, O’Connor faced a tough competitor in Saddoris, but escaped with the conference title.
“[Saddoris] did a good job of shutting me down a bit,” O’Connor admitted. “He scouted me pretty hard...but I’m happy. It was a stepping stone towards my bigger goals.”
And after finishing the season ranked No. 1 in the country, those goals—including a national title—seem well within reach.
“[O’Connor] didn’t wrestle his best in the finals, but it was good enough to get his hand raised,” Weiss said. “And I think he’ll get to the point with his last national championship tournament where he’ll let it all out.”

While the weather in Cambridge took a turn for the warmer this weekend, members of the Harvard nordic ski team headed north to Rangeley, Maine for one last race in the snow—a 50k-freestyle race at TD Bank Rangeley Lake Loppet.
Sophomore Tor O’Brien took 29th for the Crimson’s top finish. O’Brien was the only member of the men’s squad to compete.
Leading the women’s team was another sophomore, Clare Miller, who placed 41st, just ahead of captain Audrey Mangan. Freshmen Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy finished 47th and 51st, respectively.
Also competing were the two nordic coaches, Chris City ’94 and Sara Cushman ’97. City, competing for the Cambridge Sports Union, finished 45th, two places ahead of Tofte, while Cushman took 49th.
Both City and Cushman are former nordic captains for the Crimson who have returned to coaching after taking time off to go to law school. Cushman was a two-sport athlete at Harvard and was named to the All-Ivy softball team in 1994.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a win against Princeton on Saturday night, the Harvard women’s basketball team would remain in contention for a share of its 12th Ancient Eight title. With a loss, the Tigers would become sole champions of the league.
Immense anticipation culminated in a nailbiter with an energized crowd at Lavietes Pavilion and even more energized players. But despite a strong showing, the Crimson (19-8, 10-3 Ivy) fell, 78-66, to Princeton (25-2, 13-0) in its first home-court loss of the season.
The final score, though, does little to demonstrate the aggressive play and small score differences that characterized much of the game.
“We actually feel we match up well with [Princeton],” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith.
After a slow start, the Crimson indeed matched the Tigers’ every move. In the first three minutes, Princeton jumped out to a quick 6-0 lead. But junior forward Emma Markley put away three jumpers and freshman guard Victoria Lippert sank a three-pointer to get momentum going for Harvard, putting the score at 14-9.
A three-pointer by junior guard Jackie Alemany and another jumper from Markley then knotted the score at 14.
Interestingly enough, Markley started her collegiate career Tigers before taking a gap year and transferring to Cambridge. But her former loyalties did little to slow down her fierce play.
“I was very proud of Emma Markley,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think Emma had a great game [Friday] night, but she picked it up tonight, and she was fantastic.”
With the score tied, the Crimson then took off with the lead. The team carried it well into the first half, and the crowd’s energy grew more electric as Harvard’s lead held on. With 2:23 left in the first, the Crimson was up, 32-29.
But the Tigers’ Lauren Edwards swayed things back in Princeton’s favor. The guard and reigning Ivy Player of the Week proved a tough opponent for Harvard throughout the night.
“When Princeton is feeling pressure, when they want to make a run, [Edwards] does it,” Delaney-Smith said.
Closing out the first half, Edwards did just that. The sophomore nailed a free throw followed by an easy jumper to tie the score at 32. She then picked up a defensive rebound and a steal to help Princeton edge ahead, 36-33, by the end of the first half.
Entering the second half behind on the scoreboard did not slow the Crimson. Markley once again got the action going as she easily netted a shot over the block of her Tiger defender.
Harvard also hustled to slow the quick play of Edwards. Junior guard and co-captain Christine Matera was key to keeping the Princeton star under control.
“Christine was positively outstanding,” Delaney-Smith said. “She had to guard [Edwards], and when she was on her, Christine did her job—[Edwards] couldn’t do much. It was a position that when other people were on [Edwards], she got the points.”
With Matera’s strong defense, the Crimson battled to gain its lead back once more. Except for a brief five-point gap, Harvard stayed within two or three points of Princeton in the first 10 minutes of the second frame. Halfway through, the Crimson trailed by three, 57-54, and the shot at the Ivy League title was still a definite possibility.
But the late minutes of the game brought with them a powerful surge from the Tigers. With just under four minutes left, Princeton sprang into the lead by eight points, 66-58.
“We knew that Princeton was going to have their runs, and we can’t stop that,” noted junior co-captain and forward Claire Wheeler.
Ultimately, the game’s final minutes saw Princeton pulling further ahead against a fading Harvard offense. Freshman and Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week—alongside Lippert—Niveen Rashid led the way, as she added easy baskets to her total of 20 points on the night.
But some in the crowd would insist that the refs played a large role in the Crimson’s lack of success late in the game. After the clock ran out, speculation buzzed, hinting that if a few controversial calls had gone Harvard’s way, perhaps the game would have turned out differently.
Wheeler indicated that the team thinks otherwise.
“Our motto is to not put the game into the ref’s hands,” the co-captain said. “We need to be able to do what we have to do to win, whether or not the refs call everything against us.”
But despite the disappointing loss, the Crimson is positive about the end of its season.
“We’re going to beat Dartmouth, and then we’re going to try to do some damage in the WNITs,” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—In a high-stakes game with postseason implications and second place in the Ivy League on the line, the Harvard men’s basketball team (21-7, 10-4 Ivy) came up short, falling to Princeton (19-8, 10-3 Ivy) on the road, 54-51.
The Crimson had opportunities on its final three possessions to take the lead or tie the game, but the squad failed to convert on any of the opportunities.
Down by one with 57 seconds remaining, Harvard looked to put the ball in the hands of co-captain Jeremy Lin, who was playing in the last Ivy League contest of his career. Lin received the ball on the perimeter from freshman point guard Brandyn Curry and drove to the hole. But as Lin powered to the basket, Tigers forward Kareem Maddox stepped in front of the 6’3” guard and rejected his shot attempt to teammate Dan Mavraides, and Princeton controlled the ball.
After coming away with a defensive stop on the other end, the Crimson had another opportunity.
Lin—who finished the night shooting 1-of-8 from the field—took the ball once again for Harvard. With 20 seconds left, Lin took a handoff from Curry along the perimeter and drove to the basket. This time, Lin got his shot off, but the ball did not cooperate, bouncing off the rim and into the hands of Princeton’s Zach Finley.
“It was great team defense,” Maddox said. “That’s why we were able to hold [Lin] to fewer points than he usually gets.”
With just 12 seconds remaining, Curry was forced to foul Tigers guard Marcus Schroeder. Schroeder knocked down both free throws and suddenly Harvard found itself down by three.
Coming out of a timeout, Harvard looked to give Lin one last opportunity to deliver for the Crimson.
Lin received the pass from Curry on the perimeter, but facing tough defensive pressure, Lin returned the ball to the freshman. Curry looked at the basket, then swung the ball to sophomore Oliver McNally with just ticks left on the clock. As time wound down, McNally was forced to heave a contested shot that deflected off the backboard.
“We just wanted to cover out on their shooters because we knew that was what they were looking for,” Schroeder said.
The Crimson’s failure to convert on its final chances was reflective of the team’s offensive struggles throughout the night. Harvard shot just 35.6 percent from the field and converted just 14-of-21 free throws.
Lin was held to eight points and two assists on eight shots. The Crimson’s second-leading scorer, freshman Kyle Casey, also struggled, finishing with five points,
Defensively, the Crimson had trouble containing Maddox, who finished with a career-high 18 points, most of which came from the charity stripe.
In the midst of disappointment, Curry was one bright spot for Harvard. The 6’1” point guard led his team in both scoring and rebounding, finishing with 11 points and 8 boards. On defense, Curry was largely successful at containing Princeton’s leading scorer Doug Davis, holding the sophomore to eight points on 12 shots.
“I thought Brandyn played a tremendous game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Obviously we need more production from different guys.”
Curry also came through in the clutch for his team, draining a three pointer with 1:15 remaining in the second half to put his team ahead for the first time in more than 14 minutes.
With Harvard trailing 50-48, Lin found Curry open in the corner. Without hesitation, Curry let the shot fly—and it was pure.
With the three ball, the Crimson grabbed its first lead since it held a 33-31 edge with 14:52 remaining.
But two free throws from Schroeder on Princeton’s next possession put the Tigers back on track, and Harvard’s inability to convert on its final three possessions doomed the visiting team.
“In a game like this, [on] every possession you’ve got to come away with something,” Curry said. “They just came away with a couple more good possessions than we did.”
If the Tigers defeat Penn tomorrow, Princeton will capture sole possession of the second spot in the Ivy League. A Tigers victory would mark the first time that the Ancient Eight has fielded three teams with 20-win seasons.
But with Cornell locking up the Ivy’s automatic bid this weekend with its win over Brown, the postseason fates of both Harvard and Princeton will rest in the hands of the postseason selection committee.
“We’re hopeful that we’ll have more opportunities to play,” Amaker said. “We would love to have a chance to be in the postseason...I think that would be a tremendous honor.”
“We had a great season,” Curry added. “Like coach said, we’re trying to see what our postseason chances are but we definitely feel good about our overall season.”

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about our project.
So it’s Housing Day and you just found out you got into Dunster. Though some of your friends may shoot you pitying glances and offer you patronizing words of sympathy, fear not! Dunster’s negative reputation is merely a front to keep the joys of this red-towered House a secret for the worthy only.
Dining Hall: Let’s be serious. Dunster has the best House dining hall. The dark wood panels, lighted chandeliers, big windows, and House Master portraits adorning the beautiful Dunster dining hall is the closest you will get to re-living the grandeur of Annenberg Hall. Even better, Dunster avoids all the things you hated about Annenberg: the staff is exceptionally friendly, the serving area is well-designed and spacious, and there are rarely long lines or limited seating. And there are no unwelcoming dining hall restrictions, so feel free to invite your friends!
As the uninformed rarely make the trek out to Dunster, the d-hall is always filled with familiar faces, and its role as a social hub doesn’t end there. You can always find fellow Meese working through the night on problem sets and papers with whom you can collaborate, commiserate, and procrastinate.
Score: +1000 for just being awesome
Common Spaces: The Dunster Grille is also a popular late-night hangout. Serving up a delicious array of unhealthy snacks seven nights a week, the Grille is an enjoyable and cheap way to fend off those late night munchies. The uber-friendly House Masters also hold frequent open houses and ice cream bashes, featuring home-made food and desserts, not to mention a kick-ass mango sorbet.
Dunster also has a library with secret rooms behind bookcases, a big TV room, a cardio room and a weight room (highly acclaimed by FlyBy!), multiple squash courts, a nice kitchen, and music practice rooms. Unlike some Houses such as Winthrop and Cabot, the underground tunnels connect all the entryways, meaning that you never have to go outside when Cambridge weather acts up (which, as you must know by now, it likes to do often). For the more temperate days in the fall and spring, the beautiful, open courtyard facing the river is a popular spot to work or relax.
Score: +20 for the Grille taking Board Plus and Crimson Cash, +50 for the free food from the Masters, -16 for the sophomore sixteen, +25 for the gorgeous courtyard, -15 for the bars in the library
Rooms: Dunster isn't exactly ideal in its rooming situation. Rooms can be small, and yes, you will probably be forced to live in a walk-through or force two beds into a bedroom at least once during your time here.
That being said, the housing is certainly not deserving of its widespread “Dumpster” reputation. N housing is almost guaranteed for sophomores, and the size and layout of rooms is, at the very least, on par with that of other Houses like Lowell and Winthrop.
Score: +15 for not having n-1 housing, -50 for cockroaches 
House spirit: Whose House? D HAUS! Dunster makes up for its somewhat abominable reputation with a robust House culture. Our happy hours—with themes such as Space, the Cold War, and Anything but Clothes—blow those lukewarm stein clubs out of the water, even attracting members of other Houses with inferior social events. Unlike some other Houses, Dunster has a small and tight community—we love our Moose family!
Score: +50 for actually knowing your fellow House mates, +200 for drunken dancing at happy hours 
Location: Dunster is admittedly one of the farther River Houses. An approximately eight- to ten-minute walk from the Yard means that your lazier friends might never come visit you. Still, you’re closer to most upperclassmen than those unfortunate Quadlings, and you might get a lovely River view from your own room. And once you get used to the fact that nothing will ever be as close as it was when you lived in the Yard, a five-minute walk to most of the other River Houses will seem like nothing.
This distance is ameliorated in part by the super convenient shuttle. When you have a 10 a.m. class in Northwest Labs during the nastiest sleet-rain-blizzard in February, you’ll thank the River Gods that you don’t live in some of the other River Houses, which are roughly equidistant to the Yard but sadly shuttle-less.
Score: -20 for losing friends (who probably didn’t care about you in the first place), +10 for additional exercise, +100 for shuttles, -5 for the addiction to Shuttleboy, -10 for the minor inconveniences when the shuttle isn’t running
Quirks: Be sure to come for the Goat Roast in the spring, a Dunster House tradition when the whole House turns out to literally roast a whole goat in the courtyard along with other things, including vegetarian options. Actually, the goat tastes pretty gross, but come for the other food, the picturesque courtyard, and the great company!
One example of our great House spirit is Blastfest, which was just instituted during the fall semester. Once a week, everyone plays the same song at the same time at max volume, flooding the courtyard with sonic enjoyment and drawing some Dunsterites into a cathartic dance-fest. Though the tradition has been temporarily put on hold, it is sure to return in the fall.
Our spring formal is called Beltane, a festival of fertility. We'll leave the rest to your imagination!
Being in Dunster builds character and teaches valuable life lessons. Dunster House pride is met regularly with pitying responses. But that’s life, isn’t it? Not everything that is good is properly recognized for its merits, and Dunster falls into that category. It’s okay—the knowledge of the awesomeness that other students don’t know of will be more than enough to sustain you through your short three years in this awesome House.
Score: -5 since it turns out goat tastes bad, +15 for the music that suits all tastes at Blastfest, +40 for Beltane “festivities,” +50 for character building
Committee Ranking: 10 out of 12. Solid.

Harvard students have been launching Web sites left and right over the past few weeks. Here are two for your procrastination pleasure.
 
The Harvard Note Pass
This unassuming Web site sells itself as a “chatroom for Harvard students, and only Harvard students” and offers chatrooms for various classes. Bored? Bewildered? Head on over.
Crimson Forums
This forum, which was built by Legata, an independent, student-run organization that now hosts Crimsonlist, is a forum dedicated to discussing campus-wide issues and other miscellanea. The site is affiliated with the Undergraduate Council, which helps to moderate and publicize the forum.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about our project.
The House of the Hare can be described as “Good, thank you very much.” Leverett is a solid House with many benefits to be had, and freshmen should feel a small jolt of excitement and breathe a hefty sigh of relief at getting sorted into this above average House.
 
 
Dining Hall: The dining hall staff is wonderfully amicable. The food stations are intuitively arranged, the drink machines are outside the kitchen for easy access, and there is always a bounty of cereal. The dim lighting may keep our dining hall from sparkling, but it gets the job done and you’ll often finding yourself spending many comfortable hours lounging. The hall is sometimes packed during dinner, in large part because of the dining restrictions of Adams and Quincy, but you usually won’t have a problem finding seating for you and your posse.
Score: +50 for a great design, -10 for being sometimes packed
 
 
Common Spaces: Lacking. The Junior Common Room is a bit of a fail. You can go there to watch TV, but the environment is not exactly a cozy one, with awkward open spaces and not enough couches to go around during social events. The Old Library is more of a space for meetings than hanging out, and the Towers do have the “G-Spot,” which despite its sexy name is a fairly tame common space. Unlike Quincy or the Quad Houses, there are few game rooms or facilities for fun activities.
 
However, there is a conveniently placed library between the Leverett Towers and McKinlock—the main building of Leverett. It has comfortable seating and tables for your studying pleasure and is open at all hours. There is also a computer lab below the library that stocks both Macs and PCs.
 
If you need to GTL, there is a decent gym in A-entryway that you can buy a key to for a reasonable price. There are also laundry rooms in all three housing locations.
Score: +50 for the library, -200 for everything else
 
Rooms: Between good and baller. Leverett housing is divided into three locations: McKinlock (Old Lev), Leverett Towers, and 20 DeWolfe St. Sophomores will be happy to hear that they get to pick from all three of these options upon entry into Leverett. Leverett’s housing options are consistently good, but there are no signature suites like the Currier ten-man.
 
DeWolfe is a great choice for sophomores who don’t mind doubling up in a quad. Rooms boast a small kitchen, an operational thermostat, an in-suite bathroom, and carpeting. Some of the DeWolfe rooms even have balconies.
 
McKinlock is another great option for sophomores with a decent lottery pick. It’s the main building, meaning the dining hall is the closest and can be easily accessed via the basement. Some of the suites also have large common rooms and views of the River that residents will appreciate. There is the occasional sighting of a cockroach or some matter of small insect, but this usually ceases after the first few weeks.
 
The Leverett Towers are characterized by large windows, grey rooms, massive common rooms, and diverse housing options. Rooming configurations include partitioned doubles, which are larger rooms that have been split into two smaller bedrooms and utilize shared bathrooms, and a type of housing called the “U”—large portions of a floor that can House up to seven Leverites or be divided into smaller rooms. Some of the Leverett rooms offer breathtaking views of the River and the Boston skyline, but heating is sometimes an issue.
Score: +200 for room diversity
 
 
House spirit: Leverett House spirit is experienced in short bursts and small quantities. The active House Committee can be credited with being the source of the majority of the House spirit and throws a number of events, including the '80s dance and stein clubs, to foster House spirit. Community nights are sometimes themed and offer an opportunity to get in touch with the weak pulse produced by Leverett pride. 
But the House list, “Leverett Open,” is as boring as its name. It is characterized not so much by conversations as by random requests and HoCo advertisements, and although the subscribers are extremely helpful, the list fails to convey a sense of community. You won’t find the overwhelming sense of House unity that exists in Houses like Mather or Currier, and interactions with your House are largely perfunctory.
 
The Master’s Open Houses are incredible. House Master and resident physicist Howard Georgi '68 has worked his magic to create a mystical concoction of sugar and dough dubbed “monkeybread” that is sure to send you into a divine ecstasy. The palatial Master’s residence is also a good place to hobnob with other Leverites as you subtly but furiously jockey for a position in front of the monkeybread platter.
 
The stein clubs are decent affairs, but underage drinking is officially prohibited and fairly carefully monitored.
Score: +100 for HoCo, +300 for monkeybread, -500 for tepidness
 
Location: Solid. Leverett is in the interesting position of being close enough to Mather for the Mather Express to be an option but still being reasonably close to the Yard and all of its facilities. Lamont isn’t too far away, but given the choice between there and Leverett’s library (which some call “Levmont”) at 2 a.m., you’ll probably find yourself choosing the latter.
Leverett is far from CVS but has a convenient alternative available in Tommy’s Value Convenience Store, which has snacks and toiletries covered.
Score: +20 for options
 
Quirks: Leverett is fairly vanilla as secret passages or hidden nuggets go. The tunnel network under McKinlock is pretty cool and has some hidden secrets, like a random foosball table. Overall, though, what you see is what you get.
Score: +20 for predictability, -50 for plainness
Committee Ranking: 9 out of 12. Two-digit numbers are such a thing of the past.
Our Rankings So Far:
9. Leverett
10. Dunster
