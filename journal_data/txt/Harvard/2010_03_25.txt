After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent announcement that Kid Cudi will perform at this year’s Yardfest was music to many students’ ears. We too are extremely excited for Yardfest—a time for all Harvard students to gather together for an afternoon of tire swings, music, food, and fun. In fact, the College should channel more attention and resources toward creating other large-scale, inclusive social events that are similar to Yardfest.
The nature of Yardfest is quite different from most of the smaller club events that are located in common rooms or dining halls. The latter events, small-scale and exclusive by their nature, do little to foster school spirit. Yardfest has a proven ability to excite the student body and draw out a big audience: Around 7,100 students came out for Sara Bareilles and Ratatat last year, and about 7,000 showed up in 2008 for Wu-Tang Clan and Gavin DeGraw. With mainstream hip-hop artist Kid Cudi, known best for his hit song “Day ‘n’ Nite,” we can expect a similarly strong or stronger turnout at this year’s concert, providing a rare opportunity for students to relish being a part of the Harvard community as a whole.
In addition to fostering school spirit that is otherwise lacking on campus, large-scale social activities offer a much-needed time to relieve stress and take a break from the daily grind of work and exams. The opportunity to see a famous artist will compel students to put down their work for an afternoon and enjoy a stress-free and fun concert. We are also glad that the event is held outdoors in the Yard—the opportunity to leave the dorms and hang out outside is undoubtedly good for students’ mental health.
Though Yardfest in general is a great event, the choice to have Kid Cudi perform is especially commendable. In the past, the Yardfest artist selections have evoked controversy, but this year, the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission made a concerted effort to pick a mainstream artist who would appeal to a larger portion of the student body. As the second-most popular poll response, Kid Cudi certainly accomplishes that goal. And students who prefer a different niche of music will hopefully be satisfied with the choice of Patrick Park as the opening act.
In years past, despite heavily debated choices of performers, Yardfest managed to draw enormous crowds. We are hopeful that attendance this year will be stronger than ever and strongly encourage the College to seriously consider offering more events like Yardfest in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congress is now approaching a crucial opportunity for financial reform. Such a reform must be tough and intelligent, as a weak reform would create a dangerously false illusion of security and stability. The House passed a major regulatory bill in December, and now Chris Dodd has brought his own Senate proposal to the floor, for debating over the next few weeks. Financial regulation must specifically address capital requirements for banks, the tools to liquidate failed financial institutions, consumer protections, derivative trading, and the immense trading operations of many major investment banks.
Raising and strictly enforcing capital requirements is vital to creating a more stable financial system. During the financial crisis, plummeting assets and the consequential market panic caused almost every major bank to fear for its solvency. Had there been more stringent capital requirements, banks would not have been in such dire trouble. As Alan Greenspan notes in his recent paper on the crisis, while requirements should not be onerous, they should leave banks in a position to effectively manage during most crises. The current legislation in the Senate directs regulators to enforce higher capital requirements but without specific capital levels. This policy must be maintained in the final bill with specific requirements, despite almost-certain industry opposition to capital measures that would alter current ways of business.
Even with this cautionary measure in place, the nature of markets and a capitalist economy is such that the failure of major institutions is inevitable. The challenge for regulators in our hyper-connected economy is to ensure that such a failure can occur in a systematic and controlled manner. Resolution authority, the ability for the executive branch to unwind failing institutions in a speedy and contained manner, funded by a bank tax that would facilitate this process, is included in both the House and Senate bills, and is a good step in this direction. Such a resolution authority must be developed in concert with international bodies, as the fallout from the failure of global financial institutions is far-reaching.
An area of fierce contention in the regulatory debate is that of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency, but such an institution is vital. Complex financial products wrought destruction on everyone from pension fund-owners to everyday homeowners. An independent CFPA would regulate financial “innovations” such as clever securitization schemes and subprime mortgages that harm lower-income Americans and pension funds while risking the stability of the economy as a whole. The Senate bill currently has a CFPA under the purview of the Federal Reserve Bank, however the creation of an independent agency would give it greater stature and thus the power and influence to adequately do its job.
In addition, the dangerous market for derivatives, financial instruments that are used to hedge against changes in asset prices, must be strictly regulated. Complex derivatives were often traded without effective monitoring, allowing companies to quietly amass incredible risks on their balance sheets. The House bill proposes that derivatives be regulated through a clearinghouse, a useful suggestion that should be kept strong so that few, if any, derivatives escape the overview of a regulator.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Congress needs to take a hard look at how these banks are structured and the purpose they serve in today’s economy. As Roger Lowenstein wrote in a recent article, banks today make an overwhelming percentage of their profits from trading, in effect making them giant hedge funds-in-disguise that pose a stability risk to the market while also performing some banking operations. The Volcker rule, which would ban banks from engaging in proprietary trading, would change technical classifications that are easy to work around, as investment banks could shift risks or sell their deposit-taking businesses with little pain. As Lowenstein notes, a transaction tax such as the one that has been proposed in England could at least raise revenue and begin to change the incentives for financial institutions.
Congress has made useful progress on some of these steps but faces fierce fights against industry lobbyists in the months ahead. Their ability to keep tough protections as well as develop regulations and structures in concert with the international community will determine whether these regulations are meaningless or create a new foundation for the financial system—and the latter is absolutely necessary to prevent another international crisis.

Why do people visit authors’ graves? What do they expect to find? The writer George Orwell had no special connection to Sutton Courtenay. He died in London and was interred in that part of the English countryside almost by chance. Visitors making the pilgrimage from Oxford ten miles out to All Saint’s Church in the little town of Sutton Courtenay don’t seem to mind; most tend to arrive, as I did, with a simple attitude of appreciation, that near mystical sense of being in the physical proximity of a great writer and decent man. And yet, in Orwell’s case, the visit isn’t arbitrary at all—were he here, he would still have much to say.
Dead 60 years this January, Orwell is today claimed by all political stripes. The familiar phrases he’s bequeathed us—one adjective (Orwellian), one year (1984), at least a few nouns (Big Brother, doublespeak, Ministry of Love)—are culled entirely from his two dystopias, “1984” and “Animal Farm”. But though those books may have earned Orwell admission into the high school canon, they are perhaps least representative of his work overall. Orwell was against fascism, but his keen sense of social injustice also led him to support emphatically a kind of democratic socialism.
Much of Orwell’s writing is unabashedly “realistic,” from his autobiographical first novel about life as a tramp in “Down and Out in Paris in London”, to his exposé of coal mining conditions in The Road to Wigan Pier, to his wartime journalism. (“Keep the Apsidistra Flying” is one of my favorites, but the moment Gordon Comstock bellows “Money, money, all is money!” is about as subtle as a lead-gloved uppercut.) He introduced to literature the lower middle classes: the ones “boozed up” on tea, enamored of tinned foods, wavering between envy of the rich and affinity with the poor.
The social divisions he spoke of persist. Modern Britain may no longer be split along extreme class lines—though several have told me they nearly didn’t come to university for fear of “not being posh enough”—and it’s often held up as more “communitarian” than the U.S. But income inequality is at record highs; the Gini coefficient last year in Britain was 0.36, nearing America’s 0.408. “Poverty for working-age adults without dependent children is now at its highest level since the start of our comparable time series in 1961,” reports the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Few may be starving, but many are simply abiding.
And so Orwell remains startlingly relevant, because—not in spite of—his polemics. “All art is propaganda,” said Orwell unapologetically to critics who thought injecting “journalism” and statistics into Wigan Pier marred the book. As he explains in his essay “Inside the Whale,” that’s what the period called for. Surprising, thought-provoking ideas are spooned up richly everywhere in his prose. The “calculated hypocrisy” in “A Clergyman’s Daughter”, when Dorothy suggests that “perhaps it’s better—less selfish—to pretend one believes even when one doesn’t, than to say openly that one’s an unbeliever and perhaps help turn other people into unbelievers too.” The challenge to Marxist (and capitalist) convictions that machines should replace labor: “Cease to use your hands, and you have lopped off a huge chunk of your consciousness.” The value of nationalism: Orwell loved England’s bad home-cooked food, its eccentric hobby culture, its aversion to French and German-style philosophical system building and yet (hence?) its solid moral core.
Turning left at a roundabout and walking down Abingdon Road toward Cullem, a thin strip of mountain stretches out behind a flat expanse of meadow; solid farmhouses rest behind name placards, and horses stand rigid in mock pastoral tableau. At a gas station, an elderly fellow with a broad pinkish face offered me a lift the last few miles. The inside of his van gave out a stove-warm heat; outside, meadows spun by greenly. “Just past Oxford, but a whole different world,” he nodded. “I try and get out here whenever I can.” He was, it emerged, a plumber driving far out of his route for part: “not the best gig, just trying to keep out of the recession.” An alright job though, he said. At last we found the vicarage on Tullis Close; just down the road was the church.
If you’ve missed the sheet of paper tacked on the door coming in, it takes a few minutes of wandering to find the gravesite. Orwell’s tomb is in the southeast corner of the churchyard, behind a line of yew trees, much more obscure than ex-prime minister H.H. Asquith’s table tomb some dozen meters behind the chancel. The simple headstone uses his birth name: “Here lies ERIC ARTHUR BLAIR. Born June 25, 1903. Died January 21, 1950.” People are still buried here, so many of the other graves have fresh cut flowers; in front of Orwell’s are only two large, thorny rose bushes, completely bare this time of year. No one else was around. I stayed for a while, then caught the next bus back, reading some columnist’s arcane policy chatter on the way home. I don’t remember what it said; it could have been right, or wrong. Anyway, it seemed to miss the point.

To the editors:
James K. McAuley’s editorial comment (“Friends with Money,” Mar. 8, 2010) was crude and ill thought out.  The Crimson Opinion page should be in the business of publishing reasoned and fact-based discussions of important campus and world events, not anecdote and invective filled criticisms of our fellow students.
Mr. McAuley’s piece is grounded in his belief that rich students at Harvard are consciously reducing the level of their consumption in order to demonstrate to their less wealthy peers that they are not immune from the current “economic hardships” most Americans are currently experiencing.
The essay’s attack on the children of the “American socioeconomic elite” rests on conjecture and not a single statement of fact other than an imperfect perception of general campus trends. It suggests that to predict someone’s morality and future conduct all we need to find out is how much money his or her daddy makes. This is just as inappropriate as the commonly held but false belief that Americans on welfare are lazy good-for-nothings looking for a taxpayer handout.
Mr. McAuley somewhat bitterly assumes that rich students are “insulting” the rest of us when they deign to live on a budget and that they do not learn anything valuable about careful spending habits.  To make his point, Mr. McAuley criticizes rich Harvard students who take the T instead of taxis, who frequent sales racks instead of high priced stores like the Tannery, and who prefer to eat in dining halls rather than patronize expensive restaurants. It is a perverse and undeserved assault.
In my view, this is admirable behavior that demonstrates restraint and self-moderation. Why does he insist on characterizing it as insincere? Would he rather that they rent stretch-Hummers and spray Dom and Henny on us poor plebs as they drive by? Would this be in the true nature of rich Harvard students, as Mr. McAuley sees them?
Mr. McAuley ends his essay with a discussion of a quotation from F. Scott Fitzgerald about the rich: “They are very different from you and me.” I will bring my own letter to a conclusion with a line from Hemingway written in response to the very one that McAuley quotes: “Yes, they have more money.”

To the editors:
I am not wealthy, but I understand rules of basic human interaction well enough to recognize the downright offensiveness of James K. McAuley’s Mar. 8 editorial comment, “Friends With Money.”
The article contends that spoiled, “affluent” students should not downplay their wealthy origins because maintaining a “veneer of more frugal circumstances” is “insulting.” Instead, in McAuley’s idyllic fantasy, wealthy students should have no qualms about showing off at every opportunity.
McAuley seems to have missed the point of being a Harvard student: learning to exist within and learn from an incredibly diverse group of individuals. He conflates wealthy students’ actions with attempts to experience “what it’s like” to be on a budget—an essentialism that is, in most instances, entirely incorrect.
The reason that many wealthy students don’t brag openly about their financial security is because it alienates their friends. Minimizing the impact of wealth differences among friends is crucial for sustaining community. Yes, some students can afford taking a taxi rather than the T, but does that mean they should abandon their friends and take the cab? Please.
McAuley’s proposal would reify class divisions and obliterate any chance of cross-class interaction. Dismissing the entire issue with a misreading of F. Scott Fitzgerald, a relegation of the “rich” to impenetrable unknowability, is recipe for disaster. Difference exists, but in situations in which its danger can be minimized without any costs—like adhering to social norms of modesty—there is no excuse to perpetuate it. Not even out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.

The commercial space on the corner of Mass. Avenue and Plympton Street that was left vacant when Adidas closed its doors last December will soon be occupied by TD Bank.
Construction on the 2,400 square food space—which is owned by the A.D. Club—began in February. The new TD Bank branch plans to open its doors this summer.
The location will include a teller line, customer service representative stations, an ATM, and Penny Arcade, TD Bank’s free coin-counting machine. The next closest TD Bank location to Harvard Square is nearly three miles away, near Fresh Pond.
“We look forward to becoming a part of this community and providing Cambridge residents and merchants with the most convenient banking services in the area,” Lauren S. McClintock, a public relations specialist at TD Bank, wrote in an e-mail.
Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was puzzled but not surprised when she learned that Adidas would not be renewing its lease.
Jillson said the Adidas store had been an active member in the Harvard Square Business Association, participating in community events such as Sparklefest. However, she said the Association’s relationship with the store began to falter last fall as communication with the store’s managers dropped off.
TD Bank will join the league of banks already located in Harvard Square, which comprises Cambridge Savings Bank, Bank of America, Citibank, and Citizens Bank.
The explosion of bank branches in Harvard Square has not gone unnoticed by small business owners in the area.
“For Harvard Square, we don’t need to have a hundred banks,” said Christos Soillis, owner of Felix Shoe Repair on Mass. Avenue. “We need to have small businesses. But you can’t tell the banks not to come here. You do need one, two, or three ... but again, you can’t really do anything about it.”

Two weeks before former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis planned to leave for her semester as a Resident Fellow at the Institute of Politics, the Jan. 12 earthquake hit. Pierre-Louis decided to postpone her fellowship until next fall, but as a Visting Fellow this week, she has focused on sharing her experiences in the aftermath of the disaster and her views for the future of Haiti.
IOP Director Bill Purcell said that when Pierre-Louis felt she could leave Haiti this month, the IOP wanted to bring her to Harvard to address students’ interest in learning about the future of Haiti.
Harvard Caribbean Club President Shellonda M. Anderson ’11, who attended a talk hosted by the Haitian Alliance, said that her visit helped remind Harvard students about the work still to be done in Haiti.
IOP President P. Kenzie Bok said that Pierre-Louis’s visit has garnered interest from across campus, including from many students not typically involved in the IOP.
In speaking with student organizations, Pierre-Louis has shared her personal insight into the experiences of Haitians during and after the earthquake.
At the time of the quake, Pierre-Louis was in a building that did not collapse, but she said she immediately rushed into the street to meet up with her daughter and grandson, who both survived.
“People were screaming in the street. I had the image of when the Towers fell in New York. It was pretty mind-boggling to see all the bodies,” Pierre-Louis said at a fireside chat at the Phillips Brooks House Association last night. “All the symbols of state—the ministries, the court of justice, the tax bureau—everything that had to do with the history of that city had collapsed.”
According to Pierre-Louis, the quake has brought to the surface, but has not changed, the problems that the impoverished country is facing.
“The first thing that came to my mind is when you have 300,000 people that died in 30 seconds, it tells a lot about the situation of the country,” she said. “Is it that we mismanaged our country so much that it was so vulnerable?”
The next steps, according to Pierre-Louis, include focusing on constructing housing, reforming an already-broken education system, and creating new jobs.
During her visit to the United States, Pierre-Louis also visited Cornell and spoke at a social venture capital conference in Miami. She will return to Haiti on Saturday to resume working with FOKAL, the independent foundation she founded in Haiti that focuses on education, human development, and economic development. She will return to Harvard in September, and she plans to focus on maintaining American interest in Haiti during her time as a Resident Fellow.
Bok said she is looking forward to the opportunity for students to learn more from Pierre-Louis during the former prime minister’s stint on campus next fall.
“There’s this personal commitment and this sort of realism about problems faced, mixed with optimism about the potential to address them, that is really inspiring,” Bok said. “The real benefit we’ll get is the opportunity to have sustained interaction.”

Just hours after returning from a trip to China, Anthropology Professor Arthur Kleinman delivered a talk about the long-standing stigmatization and subsequent marginalization of the mentally ill population in Chinese society.
Using his expertise in the areas of medical anthropology and psychiatry, Kleinman pointed to various cases of stigmatization in China. People suffering from schizophrenia, HIV/AIDS, leprosy, or epilepsy often face social marginalization because of their illnesses.
Unlike in the United States, where people are born “fully human,” Chinese society demands that individuals “become human,” said Kleinman, who has spent years researching mental illnesses and violence in China and Taiwan.
“Your great task in life is cultivating your humanity,” Kleinman said. “People with stigma not only lose their moral face, but are not considered human.”
Further comparing the U.S. and China, Kleinman noted that Chinese mental illness hospitals emphasize the protection of society from the mentally ill—a mindset that cultivates a perception of the mentally ill as unpredictable, out of control, and potentially dangerous.
“Stigmatization makes a person a dead door, or si menzi, marginalizing them from their families, professions, society and themselves,” Kleinman said.
Kleinman added that the solution to the problems of stigmatization will come from “unintentional cultural changes”—which have been happening over the past couple of decades—that eventually strip mental illnesses of stigma.
Kleinman’s talk was sponsored by the Medical Committee of Harvard China Care, a student-run organization that seeks to guide abandoned, orphaned, and special needs children in China toward brighter futures.
Daphne Y. Xiao ’11, who attended the talk in the Lowell junior common room, said that she found Kleinman’s comparative analysis between Chinese and American societies’ dealings with the issue of stigmatization to be “the most interesting part of his speech.”

Panelists at the Harvard Extension School’s 100th-anniversary symposium yesterday reflected both on the consequences of the economic downturn and offered forward-looking visions of what recovery should look like.
According to Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension Michael Shinagel, the event—entitled “Doing Business in the Post-Meltdown Economy: What, if Anything, Will be Different?”—aimed to bring together panelists of diverse backgrounds in order to holistically inform Harvard students.
Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy and senior fellow of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, spoke of what he called the “pain of the financial meltdown.”
He also cited the deaths of children in Third World countries as a symptom of the financial recession.
Parker emphasized the importance of institutions such as the Extension School for providing knowledge that could potentially combat greed and short-sightedness on Wall Street.
He also characterized the duty of the Extension School as training a new generation of leaders, describing the institution as the “Hope Diamond in the crown of knowledge.”
Stuart H. Sadick, a partner at the executive search and leadership consulting firm Heidrick & Struggles, discussed the process of acclimating to the economy.
“I think I have a little bit of a problem with the notion of meltdown,” he said. “I think what we have just gone through is a profound, challenging adjustment.”
Sadick described the economic slump as an opportunity to reinvent oneself.
“When everyone zigs, you better learn to zag,” he added.

Harvard continued its dedication to dispersing knowledge online Tuesday with the launch of a Harvard page on iTunes U.
The new page, which had been discussed for several years before the University began working to make it a reality about two months ago, allows Harvard to post free podcasts and videos for download on iTunes. Harvard’s first set of content ranges from a series of lecture videos from government professor Michael J. Sandel’s popular course “Justice” to tracks performed by the Harvard Kuumba Singers.
Harvard is the most recent of many prominent institutions to begin this program. Yale, Stanford, Brown, MIT, and Oxford are some of the more than six hundred universities worldwide that post educational materials on iTunes.
The Harvard Extension School launched its own iTunes content page in Feb. 2007 and currently publishes lecture videos of full courses as well as short previews of other classes.
“Harvard has so many amazing stories to tell,” said Perry S. Hewitt ’87, Harvard’s director of digital communications and communications services. “This seemed like a great way for us to connect with many of our target audiences and encourage Harvard’s core focus of teaching, learning, and research.”
Esten Perez, director of communications for the Institute of Politics, said that this new medium would also help the IOP achieve its goal of providing information to as many people as possible.
“If we can grow more of an audience, that can only help contribute to the wide range of issues that we discuss,” Perez said.
The launch of Harvard on iTunes U is aimed at reaching out to an audience that spans far beyond the Harvard student body.
“The impetus for doing this now is the prevalence of mobile devices and the heavy in interest in downloading materials to mobile devices. We wanted to make sure to provide content that is available not only on phones, but also on tablets for the future,” Hewitt said.
Sarah Wang ’10 said that she looked forward to taking advantage of this new resource.
“I think that the coolest thing would be that I could watch not only for classes that I’m in, but for classes I’m not in,” Wang said. “Everyone could tune in and explore topics that they are interested in.”
Maryum J. Jordan ’10 echoed Wang’s sentiments.
“I could definitely see someone like people from my family using this,” she said. “It’s something a parent could use if they want to see what their child is doing at Harvard.”

MIT Ph.D. student Alp Simsek, whom economics professor Jeremy C. Stein called “the most sought-after person on the economics job market this year,” will join the economics department as an assistant professor next fall.
Simsek, whose work focuses on macroeconmics and finance, is the only hire in the department for the 2010-2011 year.
According to Stein, not only is Simseck a “superstar,” but his area of expertise “fit with what we needed.”
“Both for teaching reasons and for the importance of [macroeconomics and finance] to research ... we have made these fields two of our top field priorities,” said John Y. Campbell, chair of the economics department. Acquiring Simsek was a “huge success,” he added.
Economic constraints have limited the department’s hiring ability, making Simsek’s joining even more significant.
The hire is “very encouraging and very important for our goal of maintaining our department at the peak of the economics profession,” Campbell said.
Simsek’s job market paper—the paper he presented to potential employers—was inspired by the financial crisis and “identifies the economic environments that are more conducive to asset price bubbles financed by credit,” Simsek wrote in an e-mail.
Simsek will design and teach a graduate course next fall that focuses on financial markets and macroeconomics. Additionally, he will teach Economics 1723: “Capital Markets” beginning in the fall of 2011.
Inspired by his relationships with professors at MIT, Simsek said he hopes to take on an advisory and collaborative role with his graduate students.
He also said he looks forward to working with undergraduates—many of whom will pursue finance-related careers—and helping them understand economics in a more “sophisticated” and “academic” way.
“[Simsek] is a brilliant young scholar ... and [he] will help a lot both with our finance teaching of undergraduates and with many interests of our graduate students in this area,” Economics Professor Andrei Shleifer wrote in an e-mail.

Guitarist and singer-songwriter Patrick Park will be opening for hip-hop artist Kid Cudi at Yardfest, the College Events Board and Harvard Concert Commission announced yesterday.
Park, 33, will bring his indie-folk stylings to Cambridge on April 18 at Tercentenary Theatre, rounding out the rap of Kid Cudi, whose act was reported by The Crimson on Monday.
“We’ve always tried to get diverse artists so that we can meet all of the musical tastes of Harvard students,” said HCC Director Synne D. Chapman ’11, who is also a Crimson magazine editor.
To date, Park has released two full-length albums. “Life Is a Song,” the first track of his 2007 album “Everyone’s in Everyone,” was featured as the final song during the series finale of “The O.C.”
He is set to release a third album, “Come What Will,” on April 6.
“In general, we like his feel,” CEB Vice-Chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr. ’11 said. “We think he would complement Cudi pretty decently.”
Anastos said that contract negotiations between Harvard and Park were “recently finalized.”
He added that he was unsure as to what songs Park would perform and whether Park was included on the fall CEB poll soliciting student input on potential Yardfest artists.
Park was chosen both for budgetary reasons and for his appeal to students who prefer the indie genre to hip-hop, Chapman said.
Park’s performance will precede the act of three-time Grammy nominee Kid Cudi, who is best known for his song “Day ‘n’ Nite,” which appeared first as a digital download and then on his 2009 debut album “Man on the Moon: The End of Day.”
At last year’s Yardfest, electronic group Ratatat followed singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, who provided more of a “daytime feel,” Anastos said, adding that Park was paired with Cudi to produce a similar effect.
“We’re really excited about Kid Cudi and Patrick Park at Yardfest,” Anastos said. “We think it’s going to be a great show.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two of the University’s largest information technology offices will be merged in an effort to eliminate redundant functions—a move that officials say will improve and standardize a variety of computing processes for students, including e-mail and printing.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Senior Client Technology Advisor Noah S. Selsby ’94 said that the consolidation is a long-term process and is expected to improve administrative efficiency. But he added that there are no concrete plans to merge all of the IT offices across Harvard’s various schools.
The consolidation process was accelerated last semester when the Chief Information Officer positions at both University and FAS IT were vacated. The two positions will now be merged into a single CIO—a symbolic and functional change that will help coordinate IT work across campus.
Selsby said that candidates for that top position have been selected, although the process is ongoing.
“Every Harvard school has had its own IT organization, which is not the most efficient model,” said FAS Associate Dean Robert G. Doyle, who heads FAS Media and Technology Services. “Now, the two biggest units will be coordinating their efforts to improve services.”
Selsby said that while the reforms might cut costs, the move was not motivated by financial reasons alone.
“The objective is not cut, cut, cut,” Selsby said. “It’s about providing really good service.”
Even though the University CIO position has not yet been filled, FAS IT and University IT have already begun to collaborate. Harvard’s internet networks were recently placed under the control of a single University office.
Since last fall, three top IT positions at Harvard have been vacated, leaving FAS and University IT without leadership but also with unprecedented administrative flexibility.
In September, FAS CIO Lawrence M. Levine left Harvard to direct IT operations at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and in February, the FAS IT executive director stepped down as well. In October, University CIO Daniel D. Moriarty stepped down without explanation.
Following the departures of the CIOs, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and University Executive Vice President Katie Lapp began to search for a CIO to oversee both organizations, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Smith said in an interview earlier this month that the search for a centralized IT leader is moving forward, motivated by the “extreme pressures” to constantly manage and update IT services. But he added that FAS will wait until the University CIO is selected to initiate more significant consolidation plans.
“We have slowed down on any further changes until we have had the opportunity to hire the new CIO so that they can be involved in the big picture from the get-go,” Selsby wrote in an e-mailed statement. In the meantime, FAS IT has begun to search for an interim Technical Manager, he added.
Selsby said that FAS IT is continuing to move forward with its planned projects despite the lack of official leadership.
“I might not say that it is ‘business as usual,’” Selsby wrote. “I would definitely say that we have hardly slowed down because of these openings.”
Selsby said that @College e-mail accounts—which have already been successfully extended to the current freshman class and select volunteers—will be issued in April to the incoming freshman class. FAS IT will also continue revamping faculty and staff e-mail servers, a process that has been termed the Iris Project, he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many Harvard students spent their spring breaks relaxing and traveling, some seniors remained on campus or went home last week to work on their senior theses, which were due after vacation.
The Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) and the Chemistry and Physical Biology (CPB) concentration both have senior theses due after spring break—an arrangement that some students and staff say provides needed flexibility for such a large endeavor.
Guy A. Edouard ’10, a CPB concentrator whose thesis is due on Monday, said that some students appreciate having the extra time to complete their work.
“At the end of the day, it’s nice to have the security blanket of an extra week,” he said.
Eduoard noted that writing a thesis for a concentration in the sciences is much different than writing one for the humanities because “science is a little bit finicky by nature,” and “you never know what’s going to go wrong or what’s going to go right.”
He added that the later due dates for CPB might help relieve the stress caused by these unexpected occurrences or results, which cannot be planned for like a humanities thesis chapter.
But not all science concentrations have their due dates after spring break. For example, the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) has theses due the day before spring break.
Andrew Berry, a life sciences concentration advisor and an OEB lecturer, said that until a few years ago, some biology theses were due after spring break. He added that the policy was changed because of Hoopes Prize nomination deadlines and because “students actually like to have a spring break.”
Berry said that while students in the OEB department are  motivated to finish their theses before spring break, the department is often lenient with offering extensions to overwhelmed students.
Professor Daniel G. Donoghue, Director of Undergraduate Studies in the English department, said that having theses due before spring break is needed to give faculty ample time to grade theses and conduct oral exams before final grades are due. Four weeks is usually required for a comfortable grading schedule, he added.
Donoghue said that while setting thesis deadlines for after spring break would give students more time to complete their work, the new academic calendar implemented this year gave undergraduates more time in January to delve intensively into their topics.

Two leaders of the Earthwatch Institute introduced themselves to the Allston community at an Allston Civic Association meeting last night, following Harvard’s announcement yesterday that the nonprofit environmental advocacy group would move its headquarters to a University-owned property in the neighborhood this April.
While one resident voiced concerns that there would not be sufficient parking space in the neighborhood to accommodate Earthwatch’s 42 employees, Allston Civic Association President Paul Berkeley said he thought the presentation “went well.”
“You get that with every project,” Berkeley said regarding the concerns. “People want to know if it will impact them.”
The Institute’s presentation, delivered by founding chairman Brian A. Rosborough, aimed to familiarize neighborhood residents with the organization’s mission of promoting sustainable environments through scientific field research and education.
Rosborough assured Allston residents that the Earthwatch Institute would be a good neighbor.
“We make the kind of noise you make when you’re thinking, so we won’t be noisy neighbors,” he said.
He also noted that the Institute, which plans to offer three fellowships for Allston/Brighton public school teachers, would give back to the community.
“We raise money through foundations that turn around and give it back to students and teachers in the Allston-Brighton community,” Rosborough said.
Starting April 26, the Institute will occupy 15,000 square feet of currently vacant building space at 114 Western Ave., which formerly housed WGBH’s public media headquarters.
The five-year lease represents Harvard’s first successful letting of its vacant Allston real estate holdings since University President Drew G. Faust announced in December that Harvard would be aggressively pursuing tenants for its properties in light of its slowing development in the neighborhood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part III of this story appeared on March 24, 2010.)
After pulling his patrol car to the side of the road, John “Jay” L. Ellison, wearing his police uniform, carefully approached a car perched in a ditch.
After the driver hung his hands out the open window, Ellison—short, sprightly, and still in his 20s—approached the vehicle.
Without warning, the man inside the car grabbed Officer Ellison’s left arm, while simultaneously reaching under a pile of clothes to grab a sharpened screwdriver.
In a flash, Ellison whipped his gun out of its holster with his free right arm and pointed the sidearm directly at the interloper’s head.
The fresh-faced officer explained with expletive-laden speech that if the aggressor wanted to make it out of the car alive, then he had only one choice: pull his empty hand out from underneath the clothes.
Recalling the incident years later, he says his words were similar to what would be in a Clint Eastwood movie.
The man’s hand came out without the weapon, and Ellison pulled him out of the car through the open window. Crisis averted.
Looking at Ellison now, sporting hip, rectangular glasses—picked out by his wife, who is finishing her education at the Extension School—and squirming excitedly in his chair in his University Hall office as he talks about his time spent doing research in Syria, one wouldn’t guess that the scholarly administrator once patrolled the streets as a police officer.
Ellison has since traded his gun for a PhD in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Harvard and a passion for learning and teaching.
Indeed, it was a strange, circuitous, and unlikely path that led Ellison to Harvard and his current position as the secretary of the Administrative Board.
Colleagues say that his unique combination of experiences also make him an effective head of the Ad Board, Harvard’s primary disciplinary body.
“One wouldn’t imagine someone combining law enforcement with his area of academic interest; he’s just a wonderful combination of opposites,” said Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson, who is also a member of the Ad Board.
AN OFFICER
Born in San Antonio, Texas, Ellison spent the majority of his childhood in Georgia, as evidenced by his noticeable Southern accent.
When his father, a large animal veterinarian, decided to get a masters degree in epidemiology, Ellison moved to Minnesota, where he completed the 11th and 12th grades. Before graduating from Spring Lake Park High School, Ellison was trained as an emergency medical technician.
After graduating, he “tried” to earn a degree in criminal justice studies at the University of Minnesota, but gave up after one semester.
“I was a straight ‘C’ student,” Ellison says without hesitation.
Instead of pursuing a degree, Ellison began work as an EMT. He soon moved back to Georgia, where he took a job as a police officer with the Gwinnett County Police Department.
“We hit the Georgia state line with $12 and everything we had in our U-Haul,” Ellison says of returning south with his wife Polly, his high school sweetheart.
AN ACADEMIC
Ellison, who never envisioned becoming an academic, says he originally decided to attend college because he wanted to spend more time with his son Nathan.
“I didn’t think I’d go to college,” he says. “I had no plan. I went to college because it was better than working.”
But while he was enrolled at Southeastern University, a Bible college in rural Florida, the former cop fell in love with an unusual subject—ancient languages.
“I remember him to be one of the very best students I have ever had in my 31-year career. He had a wonderful attitude and a great aptitude for learning as an older undergrad student,” wrote Steven M. Fettke, who is still a professor at Southeastern, in an e-mail.
After taking a course on the Hebrew Bible, Ellison says he developed an interest in epigraphy, the study of ancient inscriptions and their classification. The course’s instructor, Harvard Divinity School graduate William H. Barnes, encouraged Ellison to apply to his alma mater.
Ellison went on to receive a Master of Theological Studies at the Divinity School and then a Ph.D. from the Department of Near Eastern Languages in 2002. His doctoral thesis was the result of a year’s research in Syria supported by a Fulbright fellowship. Entitled “A Paleographic Study of the Cuneiform Alphabetic Texts from Ras Shamra/Ugaritic,” the final product was 950 pages long, split into three volumes, and contained 1,800 photographs.
While at Harvard, he has steadily worked his way up the administrative ladder, moving from the head teaching fellow of a large core class to the Allston Burr Senior Tutor—now referred to as the Resident Dean—of Lowell House.
“I think one of the reasons Jay works so well for us is because he was a senior tutor in Lowell,” Pforzheimer House resident dean Lisa Boes says. “He understands what we do.”
Ellison has remained connected to his academic background; he still teaches Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations classes and taught a freshman seminar last semester.
He says he considers teaching an essential part of his job as secretary of the Ad Board.
“The reason [students] are here is the classroom, and I need to have contact with that,” Ellison says. “I get to see [students] at their best.”
AN ADMINISTRATOR
While Ellison no longer wields a gun, he is still an enforcer of the rule of the land. Today his focus is no longer on the laws of the state, but rather the rules of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Ellison’s responsibilities include working with students who have been reported to the Ad Board, collaborating with resident deans, and organizing and participating in Ad Board proceedings. His plethora of previous experiences help him better understand the perspectives of different people involved in the Ad Board process, according to his colleagues.
“Jay is able to wear an incredible number of hats when he’s on the board,” says former Undergraduate Council President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, who was a member of the Committee to Review the Ad Board.
While Ellison says that he is a “kinder and gentler Jay” than he was during his four years working as a police officer, members of the Ad Board say his experience in law enforcement helped to prepare him to lead Harvard’s disciplinary body.
Ellison’s understanding of the legal system—another by-product of his police work—has also been of use in dealing with Ad Board cases with criminal implications, according to Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Registrar Barry S. Kane, who also sits on the Ad Board.
Moreover, working in the stressful environment of law enforcement prepared Ellison to manage Harvard’s emergency situations, such as the Kirkland shooting last May.
“The fact that I was a police officer means that I understand emergencies,” he says. “I don’t get riled. I know how to handle them.”
While years have passed since Ellison was last paid to wield a gun, he has not lost his affinity for the profession and those who hold it.
When administrators traveled to this year’s Harvard-Yale Game, Ellison rode to New Haven with members of the Harvard University Police Department, recalls Associate Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin II.
“I wouldn’t peg him as a cop except when I see him with other cops,” McLoughlin says. “He might as well have a uniform on. They love him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an orphanage in Botswana, a 14-year-old girl lost her mother to AIDS last year, quietly resigning herself to what must have been a catastrophic blow in the life of a child.
Her mother was one of 11,000 to fall victim to HIV/AIDS in Botswana that year.
Facing the second highest HIV infection rate in the world, the Botswanan government has taken steps in recent years to increase access to antiretroviral drugs.
Of the roughly 350,000 living with HIV/AIDS—or one-third of the country’s adult population—56 percent received treatment in March 2005, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Since the mid 1990s, Harvard faculty and students have flown out to two outposts in Botswana and Tanzania—the cornerstones of Harvard’s presence in Africa—to conduct ground-breaking HIV/AIDS research.
But earlier this year, Harvard’s two HIV/AIDS research centers in Africa each spun off limited liability companies, a strategic move that will open up funding streams that had previously been off-limits due to federal restrictions.
For the 120,000 AIDS orphans living in Botswana, the potential funding increase could speed further advances in research as well as public health initiatives.
When JJ Diah ’10 visited the SOS Children’s Villages orphanage last spring during her semester in Gaborone, she found that this young girl—whose name Diah does not remember—managed to keep an outlook on life defined more by hope than by despair.
“She didn’t expect her mother to die, but she knew that it was a possibility—it was that HIV/AIDS is a reality,” Diah says. “For them it’s like, we know which family members have HIV/AIDS, and we know people are going to die from this.”
A TOWERING FIGURE
The biography of Harvard School of Public Health professor Myron “Max” Essex reads much like the history of HIV/AIDS research.
Essex was one of the first to link retroviruses to AIDS, to discover that HIV could be transmitted through bodily fluids, and to identify the protein now used world-wide to screen for the disease.
Despite Essex’s protests (“I don’t like to use the word ‘breakthrough,’” he says), the founder of Harvard’s facility in Botswana has overseen multiple major advances in the field, saving countless lives in the process.
With the creation of limited liability companies, the research centers—which had been funded primarily through grants from the National Institutes of Health—will gain access to grants from European entities as well, says Jorge I. Dominguez, the University’s vice provost for international affairs.
It remains unclear how much funding the African centers will receive, but Wafaie Fawzi, who directs the program in Tanzania, says he expects an increase in funds available for research.
In describing the future of the centers, Dominguez says that he expects them to partner with a local nongovernmental organization, drawing a parallel to Harvard Medical School’s relationship with its affiliate hospitals.
“We’ve committed ourselves to do the capacity building necessary so we can turn all assets over to a nongovernmental organization in Botswana that will ultimately receive the funding from the federal government,” Dominguez says.
LOCALIZING CARE
Max L. Dougherty ’10 could not help feeling slightly panicky when he first arrived in Botswana to work in Essex’s lab last spring.
“I didn’t really know what to expect,” Dougherty says. “What struck me is the dryness of the land—any sort of open space is just dirt.”
“It’s in the desert,” Dougherty adds. “The country just looks very brown.”
But once Dougherty joined Essex’s lab, the foreignness of the African country began to fade.
“When I first got there I was impressed,” Dougherty says. “It looked like a lab you would expect to see anywhere.”
Interviews with students who worked with Essex last spring paint a picture of a close-knit scientific community holed up in the lab, decoding genomes, analyzing drug resistance, and researching HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children.
Carlos C. Becerril ’10 recalls working late in the lab, analyzing the transmission of drug-resistant HIV.
His research yielded results—the drug-resistant HIV strain typically found in Botswana is usually not transferable. Botswanans infected with HIV can begin treatment immediately upon diagnosis, since the strain they contracted is likely not to be drug-resistant, which would require a different course of treatment, Becerill says.
This finding means that drugs can be delivered faster, increasing health practitioners’ success rates.
“Now that I look back, I’m happy that I spent as much time in the lab as I did,” Becerill says. “It showed me that if you put the work into it, you can really accomplish something.”
Several Botswanans work in Essex’s lab, which is located next door to the capital city’s main hospital, and Essex is quick to emphasize that his facility is not meant to provide care for area residents, but to conduct research.
Health clinics in the developing world face the challenge of striking a balance between bringing in outside experts and building up local expertise to set up long-term care structures.
And Essex doesn’t expect to reach the ultimate goal of establishing locally operated HIV/AIDS clinics any time soon in Botswana.
“We have students for research training and a number of medical students who are training clinical fellows at the hospital, but in relation to turning it over the people of Botswana—certainly that’s a long term goal in 10 or 20 years,” Essex says.
On the other hand, the establishment of the Africa Academy in Tanzania has made progress in training Tanzanians to give medical treatment.
The research and teaching hub for health professionals hopes to apply lessons learned from the University’s research endeavors to improve health infrastructure in the region—an effort that may have long-term positive repercussions for health in sub-Saharan Africa.
“These organizations will allow us to have a better chance to develop initiatives to address public health problems in Tanzania and the region and to tap into our resources,” Fawzi says.

Victory.
It’s what every athlete strives for. From little league to the major leagues, it’s the ultimate goal of anyone who steps onto a field, court, or rink.
For Brent Suter, victory is something he’s experienced his entire life.
The sophomore was a four-year letterwinner in both basketball and baseball at powerhouse Moeller High in Cincinnati. During Brent’s four years at the school, his basketball team won the conference title four times, won a state championship, and went 85-5. His baseball team won three conference titles and made a state final four, with Brent being named to the All-League and All-City teams.
“We were so used to winning, and being so much more talented than the other teams that even if we didn’t play our best, we knew we could still pull out a victory,” Brent recalls.
This dominance is a common thread in the Suter family. Brent’s father, Mike, won a football national championship in 1982 at Penn State. His mother, Shirley, was a state swimming champion in high school.
Having parents who know how to win had a major impact on Brent’s childhood, inspiring him to reach the high level of achievement that his parents attained.
“Seeing their work ethic really influenced me,” Brent says. “My mom still swims a bunch of laps [and] my dad goes to the gym a lot."
Yet despite their athletic achievements, the Suters always stressed that to be a winner, Brent would need to act like one. That meant showing commitment to his sport and giving one-hundred percent every time he stepped out onto the field.
“I think the biggest thing that we’ve probably taught Brent in terms of being a winner is preparation, working hard, giving it everything you’ve got,” Mike explains. “It’s not just the game. It’s what you’ve got to do to prepare.”
The lesson paid off, as Brent has displayed an unwavering commitment to his passion for baseball ever since he was a child.
“What set him apart is he just loved the game and worked hard at it,” Mike says. “He always wanted to throw a baseball, hit a baseball ... it wasn’t work for him, it was something he really enjoyed.”
Brent distinctly remembers a story from seventh-grade basketball, in which he was playing point guard and didn’t take a shot the entire game, even passing up wide-open lay-ups in order to give his teammates the ball. After the game, his parents brought him into a room which had a sign that read, “A ship in the harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are built for.”
“They were saying that if you have the talents God gave you, you should use them,” Brent explains. “You should grab the bull by the horns and take risks. Moments like that really helped me along.”
But for all the individual successes of the Suter family, Mike and Shirley made sure to teach their son that coming out on top wasn’t always the most important result.
“It was more about really being the best I could be, taking risks, working hard,” Brent says. “The focus wasn’t always on winning, it was on doing things the right way.”
In fact, the family of champions always made sure that their son knew there would always be a winner and loser in life. As a result, Brent grew up well aware that, despite his successes, he must always be prepared for a turning of the tide.
“You don’t want to go through your whole life winning,” Brent says. “Because then if something bad happens down the road, you can fall into some type of depression if you’ve never dealt with failure before and can’t see the silver lining in the clouds.”
Though Brent had his parents to teach him this method, Mike had to learn it the hard way. Playing Alabama during the 1982 season, Mike accidentally blocked his own team’s punt late in the fourth quarter, when he backed into the punter and the ball hit off his head.  The play cost the Nittany Lions—who were down by just three points—the game, as the Crimson Tide recovered the fumble and went on to win 42-21.
It was a humiliating moment for Mike, who was called “the loneliest man in college football” by ESPN’s Chris Berman. Ironically, the error occurred when he had just started to get an increase in playing time. Despite the fact that Mike was a key contributor on the team that went on to win 12 consecutive games and the national championship, it was that one moment which people always remembered.
It taught Mike about the unpredictability of sports, how any athlete can be defined by one moment instead of an entire career, no matter how unfair that may be.
“Joe Paterno always said ‘you’re never as good as you think you are when you win, and you’re never as bad as you think you are when you lose.’” Mike says.
It was a message he took to heart and passed on to his son, who also used it for comfort.
When Brent had a similar moment in middle school basketball, giving up a steal that cost his team the game, it was this message of keeping your head up that prevented Brent from getting too down on himself.
Just like his dad, Brent’s team ended up winning the championship that year, and Brent, just like his father, had learned how to accept failure.
It’s a lesson that Brent still holds in great importance today. As an outfielder and pitcher for the Harvard baseball team, which has struggled early in the season with a 3-10 start, Brent is on the other side of the win column for the first time.
But thanks to his parents, the kid who had always won is able to deal with losing.
“It’s an adjustment period right now, but I feel as if it will definitely be a good thing for me in the long run,” Brent says.
Just as he learned about how to deal with the rough patches from Mike’s miscue, Shirley’s advice has helped him fight through the team’s early-season struggles as well.
“My mom told me stories about some of the swimming practices that were just the most brutal things,” Brent says. “Not many people could get through them, but she did, which helps me.”
Despite his team’s woes, Brent continues to work hard, even though playing two positions is no easy feat.
“I’m definitely going through an adjustment period, both mentally and physically right now,” he says. “This year I’m learning new things. I haven’t hit for two-plus years so it definitely feels kind of new being up at the plate.”
After starting nine games as a freshman last season, Brent led the Crimson in wins, strikeouts, and ERA. This season, having to readjust to being an everyday player, he has struggled both at the plate and on the mound.
“It’s a challenge, but it’s making me look inside myself,” Brent says. “It’s definitely a test of my character.”
After a lifetime of triumph, there’s no reason to believe Brent won’t pass that test with flying colors.

For the Harvard fencing team, perhaps the third time really is the charm.
This weekend, the Crimson will be hosting the NCAA Fencing Championships for the third time at the Gordon Indoor Track.
“NCAA championships fencing is a very competitive event,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It brings together some of the best fencers in the world. It’s an opportunity for the Harvard community to see a very special event.”
Both the Crimson men’s team (14-7, 3-2 Ivy) and the women’s team (15-8, 3-3 Ivy) will be sending the maximum number of fencers—two for each weapon­­­—for a total of 12 fencers to the National Championships, out of a field of 144 fencers.
This represents one of the best chances for Harvard—ranked No. 6 for men and No. 9 for women—to take home a number of individual championships as well as a possible team title.
“We qualified 12 [individuals],” Brand said. “I was very, very pleasantly surprised by our performance at the regional event, and consequently we have a shot at the title this year.”
Harvard’s toughest competition will come from No. 1 Notre Dame and No. 2 Penn State, while St. Johns, Princeton, and Ohio State will also look to contend for individual and team accolades.
“Both the women’s and men’s fields are extremely strong,” Brand said. “The last couple of years, Harvard has had a very strong fencing program, and we are always a match for any fencing programs in the country.”
But the opposition is just as talented as the rising Crimson squad.
“The biggest strength [Notre Dame and Penn State] has is that they are such deep teams,” senior Karl Harmenberg said. “All their 12 fencers from both squads have a shot at clinching the competition.”
On the women’s side, sophomore co-captain Noam Mills and freshman Felicia Sun will be competing in epee, sophomore Shelby MacLeod and senior Artemisha Goldfeder will represent Harvard in foil, and freshman Elena Helgiu and sophomore co-captain Caroline Vloka will participate in sabre.
Mills, MacLeod, and Vloka took home All-Ivy first team accolades, and Mills and Vloka took second place at NCAA regionals in their respective weapons, while MacLeod took fourth.
For the men, Harmenberg and sophomore James Hawrot will compete in epee, freshman Tommasso di Robilant and junior Hao Meng will contest in foil, and freshman Michael Tom and sophomore Valentin Staller will represent the Crimson in sabre. Staller earned All-Ivy first team honors while Hawrot and Harmenberg were named All-Ivy second team. In addition, Hawrot and Harmenberg placed first and third, respectively, in the foil at the NCAA regionals last weekend.
Based on these results, Brand has confidence in his men’s team.
“On the men’s side,” Brand said. “I believe right now the person who has a shot is Valentine Staller in saber. I think a dark horse coming in would be James Hawrot in epee.”
Having the competition on home turf will definitely improve the chances of the Harvard fencers, as the Crimson men boast an overall record of 11-2 at home this season while the women’s team holds a perfect 7-0 record at home.
“The home field advantage definitely does enhance our chance,” Brand said. “I think the fencers are really excited for having their family and friends to come and cheer for them … and I think that we’re going to benefit from that.”
The Crimson fencers are taking these last couple of days to prepare both mentally and physically for the championship and the challenges ahead.
“We are working very hard,” Brand said. “We are taking the opportunity to use every minute we have to prepare for this event. We are very excited and we want to put on a good show for our friends and family here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With co-captain J.P. O’Connor’s national championship victory last weekend, The Harvard Crimson has indulged in an outpouring of wrestling coverage. Or at least as the wrestling beat writer, I’ve pushed this coverage to a point bordering on creepy obsession.
But this focus is somewhat understandable. Sports writers love success stories and treasure the idea of reaching that “ultimate goal,” an achievement that only a piece of NCAA hardware or a place on a podium can make tangible.
Yet, in the celebration of O’Connor’s unique feat—the third national championship and first perfect season in Harvard wrestling history—we should not lose sight of the timeless maxim often overlooked in competitive sports: it’s about the journey, not the destination.
By the end of the wrestling championships in Omaha, Neb., the Crimson featured two senior competitors who had arrived at very different finales. As O’Connor (157 lbs.) had his hand raised in triumph, co-captain Louis Caputo (184) was left on the sidelines, contemplating what could have been if not for a second-round exit in the tournament.
“For Louis, I’m heartbroken,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “He’s done everything right to be competitive at a high level—it’s a tough ending.”
But while so much focus rests on these season-ending bouts, no member of Crimson wrestling will suggest that Caputo—a two-time All-American—left anything behind in his Harvard career.
All week, it’s been easy to compare the two wrestlers tied for the most wins in Harvard history—O’Connor and Jesse Jantzen ’04 at 132 apiece—but few have noted that Caputo is next on the list with a career record of 126-35, making the current co-captains the most dominant tandem in program history. With five All-American nods and five first-team All-Ivy selections between them, along with two straight years spent together in the top ten, Caputo and O’Connor mark an historic pairing in Harvard wrestling.
And beyond the duo’s dominance on the mat (in three years of covering the team, I’ve never seen either competitor lose in person), through their friendship and leadership, the two have accomplished more for the Crimson together than either could have done alone—namely by showing other members of the program how tight-knit the team family can become.
“Louis is still one of my best friends, someone I look up to,” O’Connor said.
“I’m just honored to go through the program with [J.P.],” Caputo echoed. “I love him to death. He pushed me, and it made me a better wrestler.”
But this is more than a bromance. The co-captains’ camaraderie and mutual work ethic has attracted others to the program, fostering a genuine sense of community that appeals to recruits.
“They are great guys,” freshman Adam Hogue said. “Both [O’Connor and Caputo] are very willing to help with your technique, but they will also help you get accustomed to something at school.”
And for all the co-captains have given to the program in four years, it seems that they got just as much back. Looking beyond all the accomplishments, others can see just how much Harvard wrestling has changed the grapplers.
“What we had asked more than anything was to help our young boy become a man,” said John O’Connor, J.P.’s father, when reflecting on his son’s choice to attend Harvard. “That’s been a tremendous evolution for him, coming in at 18 years old and developing into a better person…We couldn’t thank all the people that have been around him any more.”
“I feel like I’ve grown up a lot,” Caputo added. “Whatever comes my way, I’ve been through the experience of working hard to achieve my goals.”
Certainly the achievements haven’t come easily. Both co-captains missed significant time due to knee injuries over their careers, with Caputo even withdrawing for a semester to preserve his senior status. And it took John O’Connor a long time to warm to the idea of his son in a perpetual headlock.
“I was concerned about the physical nature [of wrestling] and some of the weight aspects,” said John, a former basketball player. “We just wanted him to be able to stay healthy and injury-free. It’s not necessarily a sport that’s easy to do that in.”
But his son managed to stay on his feet through an undefeated senior season, capping his campaign with something every sportswriter dreams to write about—a hard-fought win for the national championship.
And though only one got to walk away with the trophy, both Caputo and O’Connor leave their names in the record books, and, much more importantly, a legacy that will motivate Harvard grapplers for years to come.
“They’re an inspiration in the room each day,” Hogue said. “[O’Connor and Caputo] are both so successful with the same circumstances, the same training room, that everyone else has. It’s a reminder that if you work hard and are determined, everything is possible.”
For the Crimson co-captains, it seems the journey was well worth it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tension can often run high when a player faces his former team for the first time.
When Mark Coury transferred from Kentucky to Cornell, it didn’t make the radar screens of basketball fans nationwide—or even those following the Ivy League. But now that the Wildcats and the Big Red prepare to face off in tomorrow’s Sweet Sixteen match-up in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, Coury will have the opportunity to help deprive his former teammates of a trip to the Elite Eight.
Coury originally joined the Wildcats as a walk-on before earning a spot in the starting lineup his sophomore year. The post player did not play last year but averaged 11.0 minutes per game this past season for Cornell.
The switch to the Ivy League from a major Division I school is not unique to Coury nor to basketball.
This past fall’s installment of The Game featured one transfer quarterback, Patrick Witt, who transferred to Yale from Nebraska. Next year’s game could feature two if LSU-transfer Andrew Hatch manages to beat junior Collier Winters for the starting nod next fall. Hatch transferred from Harvard to LSU and then back to the Crimson, picking up a National Championship ring on his way.
It remains to be seen whether Coury’s new team will find the same success as Hatch’s second squad did, or if teammate Ryan Wittman will be the one to repeat history, watching the Wildcats end his collegiate career just as they had ended his father’s. (Wittman’s father, Randy, played basketball for Indiana.)
Regardless, hoops fans nationwide will be sitting on the edge of their seats throughout this Sweet Sixteen match-up watching top quality, high-stakes basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re a sports fan and you haven’t been living under a rock without Wi-Fi, you know by now that the Cornell men’s basketball team has become this year’s March Madness media darling during its remarkable run through the NCAA Tournament. After upsetting Temple and Wisconsin, the Big Red finds itself in the Sweet 16 tonight taking on its toughest challenge yet: No. 1 seed Kentucky.
As the country watches, so will a number of Harvard athletes. Cornell’s success evokes mixed emotions here on campus, especially for the Crimson men’s basketball players. Not long ago, it was Harvard that was grabbing the headlines, thanks in large part to star senior Jeremy Lin’s uncanny all-around play and a group of talented, energetic young players.
The Crimson made a name for itself by standing tall against tough opponents, upsetting Boston College for the second year in a row and taking a then-No. 13 UConn team down to the wire. But while Harvard set a school record with 21 wins, it faltered in league play and was unable to secure its first-ever Ancient Eight championship. Now the Big Red has brought the often overlooked Ivy League to the forefront of the sports-watching nation’s consciousness, and Crimson athletes are forced to reconcile Ivy pride with the bitterness of seeing a rival thrive.
“I’m kind of neutral,” Lin said. “The more [Cornell wins], the better the Ivy League looks. But at the same time... being a competitor, playing against them, it’s tough to root for them.”
For some of Harvard’s younger players, many of whom were highly-touted recruits brought in by coach Tommy Amaker to revitalize a long-stagnant program, the Big Red provides a possible glimpse into their own future.
“If they can do it, there’s no reason we can’t do it,” freshman guard Christian Webster said.
Webster alluded to Cornell’s core group of veterans—spearheaded by the now-heralded senior trio of Ryan Wittman, Jeff Foote and Louis Dale—as a model for success that the Crimson may soon be able to emulate.
“They’ve been together four years,” Webster said. “We’re going to be doing the same thing in a few years.”
Whatever their perspective, the Harvard men’s basketball team will be watching the Cornell-Kentucky game closely tonight, along with the Crimson’s biggest fan, senior Cheng Ho.
Ho, a running back on the football team and a blockmate of Harvard hoopsters Lin, Doug Miller and Pat Magnarelli, led student efforts to energize the Crimson’s fan base in Lavietes Pavilion during the basketball season, almost singlehandedly turning the small arena—often derisively compared to a high school gym by other schools’ supporters—into a lion’s den for visiting teams. (See here and here.)
Now, Ho has focused his (albeit dampened) enthusiasm on Cornell’s run, going as far as picking the Big Red to play in the championship game in his personal bracket (“A bold move,” as he called it, made even bolder considering his other pick was the now-eliminated Kansas).
“A lot of people have this idea that the Ivy League is not a contender [in athletics],” Ho said. “The fact that Cornell is doing so well speaks for the league and is related to our school.”
Strange as it might be for a Harvard athlete, most seem to have jumped on the Cornell bandwagon, at least until the Crimson gets another shot at the three-time defending Ivy League champions next year.
“At first, because it’s our archrival, I wasn’t rooting for [Cornell in the tournament],” sophomore guard Max Kenyi said. But after casting aside the initial bitterness, Kenyi reconsidered.
“I guess deep down inside I was rooting for them.”

A reader just sent us this tasty tidbit: a new quick-service restaurant might be coming to Holyoke Street.
According to the notice posted on the door of 7 Holyoke St. (which is across the street from the New College Theatre), a public hearing to discuss granting a restaurant permit for the location was scheduled for Mar. 11, 2010. We just called the city's Board of Zoning Appeals, and they have confirmed—the permit was granted!
But we were told that the transcript of the hearing isn't on file yet, so more details will have to come later. We do know, however, that the permit petitioner was Ayr Muir, an MIT grad and the CEO of Clover Food Lab. According to its Web site, Clover operates a "food truck" near MIT that features local (often organic) vegetarian fare on a menu that changes with the seasons. Yelp tells us that Clover food is both good and cheap. We think that's an auspicious sign.

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 25, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 25 post "Weekend Roundup" incorrectly gave the date of the "OH! The 2000s Dance" as Saturday, Mar. 27. In fact, the event is occuring on Friday, Mar. 26.
