After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Ordinance Committee heard public testimony on granting permits for recreational marijuana shops in Cambridge at a City Council hearing Thursday.
The City Council is currently considering legislation that would regulate the process for acquiring permits to open recreational marijuana shops in Cambridge. The proposed legislation prioritizes the granting of permits to those from historically marginalized groups such as women and minorities.
The prioritization of historically marginalized groups comes from 2017 guidelines by the statewide Cannabis Control Commission that seek to “ensure that people from communities that have been disproportionately harmed by marijuana law enforcement are included in the new legal marijuana industry.” In order to do this, the commission created specific programs to prioritize these applicants.
The discussion at Thursday’s hearing centered on two amendments to the proposed legislation: one submitted by Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Quinton Y. Zondervan last week, and the other by Councilor E. Denise Simmons Thursday morning.
Siddiqui and Zondervan's amendment would bar anyone who is not an “economic empowerment” or “social equity” applicant from opening a recreational marijuana shop in Cambridge for the next two years.
“We have over 100 economic empowerment applicants in the state and not one has been able to open a store yet, so this is a great opportunity for us in Cambridge,” Zondervan said at the hearing Thursday.
In an interview Friday, Siddiqui said the amendment constitutes a “head start” for local businesses over larger corporations.
In response to some local medical marijuana dispensary owners' concerns that this rule might hurt their ability to subsidize costs for patients, however, Simmons introduced a second amendment just hours before Thursday’s hearing. That amendment would allow current registered marijuana dispensaries to begin selling recreational marijuana if they contribute $250,000 annually to a fund to assist “economic empowerment” businesses for the next four years.
During the hearing, Simmons said she was concerned about hurting patient access if Siddiqui and Zondervan’s proposed amendment passed.
“We just want to be sure at least here in Cambridge that we are providing as much equity and continuity of service and care when we talk about the medical part of it as possible,” Simmons said.
Simmons also said the pair’s proposed amendment “may violate state law,” given that it prevents those who do not qualify from opening a dispensary for two years.
Zachary W. Berk, a lawyer from Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr law firm — which represents three Cambridge medical marijuana shops — testified at the hearing that Simmons's amendment is a “win-win for everyone” and urged the councilors to adopt it. The firm submitted a letter Monday to the council on behalf of its clients — Sira Naturals, Inc., Revolutionary Clinics, Inc., and Healthy Pharms, Inc. — that stated Siddiqui and Zondervan’s proposal is unconstitutional and would be "swiftly challeged" by the firm's clients.
Despite this concern, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa said at Thursday’s hearing that she believes it is “legally permissible” to institute a delay of up to two years prior for when anyone other than “economic empowerment” or “social equity” applicants can open a recreational marijuana shop.
In response to Simmons’ proposed amendment, Zondervan said at Thursday’s hearing that “economic empowerment” applicants and registered marijuana dispensaries should discuss the feasibility of the proposed fund in the coming weeks to ensure “the arrangement would work.”
The City Council has been considering how to regulate the new legal marijuana industry for months. It voted to begin drafting recreational cannabis zoning and licensing laws in March 2018. The council heard a zoning petition in September 2018 proposing various conditions for retailers to be able to sell recreational marijuana in Cambridge.
The vote and petition came after Massachusetts voters legalized recreational marijuana through a November 2016 state ballot referendum.
The hearing drew a crowd of hundreds of local residents and advocates who were divided on the two amendments.
In his testimony, Cambridge resident Grant E. Ellis said that Simmons’ amendment would be “tantamount” to giving “corporate marijuana interest” the same advantages as “economic empowerment” or “social equity” applicants.
“I feel personally, along with the people that I'm here with, that the amendment to the ordinance places corporate medical marijuana dispensaries on an equal footing with those harmed by the war on drugs, which is an outrageous affront to human decency,” Ellis said in an interview Thursday.
Nichole Snow — the executive director and president of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance — said she supports Simmons's amendment during her testimony. In an interview after the hearing, Snow said she lobbied Simmons to submit the amendment to ensure that medical marijuana dispensaries can compete in the new market.
Asked about the MPAA’s lobbying efforts, Simmons did not respond to a request for comment.
At the conclusion of the hearing, city councilors decided not to vote on the legislation and said they will continue discussions in July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 40 local residents, including several members of the Cambridge Historical Commission, gathered for a public presentation of a Harvard billionaire’s plan to rebuild the Harvard Square Theater at the planned construction site Thursday evening.
Billionaire and top-tier Harvard donor Gerald L. Chan purchased the theater located on 10 Church St. — which has been vacant since its 2012 closure — in 2015. In 2017, Chan officially announced his plans to demolish the existing theater and construct a new mixed-use building, adding 14 feet of height and establishing a large LED-dotted facade for outside art displays.
Since its unveiling, Chan’s plan has been a subject of controversy among Cambridge residents. In September, the Cambridge Historical Commission postponed granting a certificate of “appropriateness” to the plans, citing concerns over the new building’s size and the lighting of the large, external video screen.
After the presentation — during which three members of Chan’s team showed the audience how the lights would operate and addressed previously aired concerns — the commission voted to hold another public hearing on the plans for the theater in the coming months.
Chan’s project manager Nathan Wong, project engineer Valentin Spiess, and Chan’s lawyer Anthony D. Galluccio conducted the demonstration using a large square panel made of terracotta tiles as a sample of the proposed façade. They showed the audience what the “expressive facade” would look like in different lighting situations: daytime, dusk, evening, and night.
“Every night-evening setting is intended to be no different than any other building, meaning that there's a soft glow of radiant light just washing the wall,” Wong said.
During the presentation, Wong clarified that the lighting would be “dim,” “nuanced,” and “subtle.” Galluccio said the team wanted to alleviate concerns from Cambridge locals that the display could be gaudy or “Las Vegas”-style.
Spiess demonstrated examples of possible animations on the facade, including an aquarium of moving animals and growing trees. Spiess also showed how cameras and sensors could detect kinetic movements of people in front of the building to display their silhouettes.
During the presentation, several audience members questioned the sustainability and energy usage of the LED panels. Spiess said he projects that if the lights ran 14 hours a day, which he said is more than expected, the energy could be produced by solar panels on the roof of the building.
Charles M. Sullivan, the executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, said he found it “gratifying” to finally see a demonstration of the facade in an interview Friday.
“I think it was fairly muted and subtle. And I think that probably will help it gain acceptance in Harvard Square,” Sullivan said. “Most of the people I talked to seem to see it pretty favorably.”
He added that the commission will have to make a judgment on whether the facade is “appropriate” for Harvard Square after further discussion.
“There is really not much like this — this specific kind of facade material with embedded LED,” Sullivan said. “This is not something that's been done anywhere in the U.S. that we're aware of.”
Graduate School of Design student Patrick C. Braga, who attended the presentation, said he believes the project is “very well designed.”
He said he appreciates the facade’s “modular” design, which reflects the brick tradition of the existing wall and the terracotta color palette, which he said incorporates the hues and tones already present on Church Street.
Galluccio — a Cambridge local — said though he recognizes that “change scares people,” he is excited to enliven Church Street with the new design.
“To come back with commercial movie theaters, a facade like this, and new retail, I think it could have a significant benefit to new activity on Church Street,” he said.
Chan’s project team will inform the commission when they are prepared for a hearing.
