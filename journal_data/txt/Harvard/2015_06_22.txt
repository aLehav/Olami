After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What about that moment when a human actively decides to step outside herself? Phrases such as “getting out of the comfort zone” and “taking risks” describe this phenomenon—they point to something deep within us telling us not to be complacent. We hear these words all the time—even the act of applying to college in and of itself is an act of getting outside oneself. And our life at Harvard seems constantly marked with the brush of possibility, if only we get out there and chase it.
The first day I walked on Harvard’s campus as a tourist, I remember going up to a girl after sitting in on a philosophy class. I asked her, “What is it like to be a student here?” She paused, smiled, took a deep breath and looking me straight in the eye, she said, “You can’t expect anyone to hold your hand here, but if you put yourself out there you will love it.”
She was right.
Getting outside the comfort zone can happen intellectually just as much as it can physically. This past semester I experienced this in taking Courtney Lamberth's Religion 57, titled “Faith and Authenticity.” At first, I was skeptical of the class. What was with this nebulous title? I came to Harvard to seek out what is true, but the idea of taking a class about faith or this concept of authenticity was not what I thought I signed up for. Besides, faith and authenticity were personal and not academic to me. How could such concepts that vary from human to human be studied?
But I think I was more scared to take this class than curious. I had some sense of faith, and knew I wanted that faith to be authentic, but I was afraid of what that would mean. What ideas would I have to sacrifice for the sake of truth, for the sake of this class? So in the end and four study cards later, I turned in the only one with Religion 57.
My red-bricked beliefs and my cold-stoned convictions met a blank white wall. This wall gave me freedom—it gave me the space to repaint my entire framework of thinking. In the course of class discussion, I was forced to reconsider my ideas about faith, human freedom, authenticity, love, life and death. Most of these I had previously left unexplored; even though I grew up in a devotedly Christian family, I had not truly taken the time to read and think about what it means to live the authentic life. I want to share that experience, I want this column to be a blank white wall for its readers.
Yet such philosophical and heady subjects are enormously difficult to talk about—they are by nature incredibly abstract and intangible. They can be exhaustive and so cyclical that eventually we find ourselves thinking, “what is the point?” and “why bother trying to understand things that can never be understood?”
I don't have an answer to that question. But I’m not convinced there really needs to be an answer.
Maybe the purpose of thinking about deeply philosophical concepts is not to arrive at a perfectly reasoned answer. Maybe the point is to just be human. After taking Lamberth’s class, I still cannot tell you what faith or authenticity is, but somehow I feel awake and alive to the fact that these concepts in some way give shape to my life. And that’s enough. Through discussing these big concepts, I hope to recreate that feeling for the readers of this column wherever they might be this summer.
My physical journey this summer will take place on the road as I travel across the country as the opening act for Allen Stone and O.A.R. As part of that journey, I am seeing parts of America I never thought I would. What I am seeing is sometimes remarkably beautiful, and other times remarkably ugly. But each sight brings me back to Lamberth’s class and the big concepts discussed. This column will come from that place, from the eyes of a musician travelling all across our country, from someone who is trying hard to chase a feeling and experience life and find a philosophy. In that journey, I hope to discover more of what Professor Lamberth was getting at in the discussion of freedom, faith and authenticity. What drives us as humans? Are we really, especially in America, living the authentic life?
There is a hashtag on Instagram that goes by the title, “live authentic.” The photos tied to this hashtag are posted by people from all over—professional hipsters travelling to Europe, the Rocky Mountains, gloriously rich deserts, and even some enjoying a simple cup of coffee at home. I used to chuckle at the photos’ overly philosophical captions. But something has shifted on the road, and my “faith and authenticity” class is extending. Maybe that is the power and glory of the road and a Harvard education—or maybe, it’s just life. Either way, there is something that travel does to get us outside ourselves and allows us to see the authentic.
One parting thought. In seeking the authentic, I already know that I can’t give any answers to what that is or looks like. I only have mere notions. But I hope that these notions will help make people feel more alive, just like “Faith and Authenticity” did for me. So join me this summer for my notions on the road.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTIAGO, Chile—With the 2015 Copa America soccer tournament taking place in stadiums all across Chile, the level of excitement among Chileans is off the charts. It's not uncommon to see waiters, bus drivers, or coworkers decked out in scarves, jerseys, and face paint representing their beloved national team. And with a flag that looks like the Texas flag I sport on way too many articles of clothing, Chile made it really easy for me to wholeheartedly throw my support behind its team.
It's hard to overstate how big of a deal people make out of this tournament. Imagine if you treated every game your team played in like the Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series, and Stanley Cup combined. That's how Chileans talk about soccer. When the team is playing, normally crowded streets in the middle of Santiago are completely deserted. The TranSantiago metro trains that are normally packed ten-people deep run empty. Street food vendors beg passers-by for a quick update on the score. I even saw a commercial for a portable TV small enough for taxi drivers to watch secretly while they work.While I normally find soccer excruciatingly boring to watch, I couldn't help being drawn in by the Copa America fever that has captured the hearts of an entire nation. When Chile played their first game of the tournament--a 2-0 win against Ecuador--I wanted to watch it where all of the biggest fans did. I talked to several people who told me that La Moneda, a ceremonial government building similar to the White House except the president doesn't live there, was the place to be to watch the game.
There was supposed to be a huge crowd cheering on their team and watching on a giant screen. I was told repeatedly how exciting of a place it was to watch soccer, so you can imagine the disappointment my friends and I shared when we got to La Moneda and found the entire plaza devoid of life. Incredulously, I asked one of the police officers guarding the building where the best place to watch the game would be. She directed us to another empty plaza where another set of officers there told us they weren't showing the game publicly this time. For a life-long soccer hater, I was surprisingly upset that I would have to take my newly-purchased fake number 8 Arturo Vidal jersey to a restaurant to watch the game.
Despite the lack of raucous public viewing places, I was finally able to satisfy my newfound desire to watch soccer when a friend found tickets to a quarterfinal game that Chile could be playing in for a reasonable price online. I can't wait to join the crowd at the National Stadium chanting, "Chi-Chi-Chi Le-Le-Le Viva Chile!" For a proud Texan living in South America for the summer, Chilean pride was all I needed to feel right at home.

Though most of the students and researchers that fill its halls may be gone for the summer, Widener Library was abuzz with activity on Friday as it commemorated its 100th birthday with red balloons, rose-topped cupcakes, and jazz music at a celebration hosted by the centralized Harvard Library system.
Widener Library was dedicated in memory of Harvard graduate Harry E. Widener, Class of 1907, in 1915 when his mother earned naming rights to the building after a donation of nearly $2 million and 400 books—a gift that Sarah E. Thomas, vice president of the Harvard Library, called the “nucleus” of the library system. Widener died aboard the Titanic in 1912.
The library officially opened on June 24, 1915, coinciding with the College’s 264th Commencement Day.
At the centennial event, Thomas lauded the progress that Widener had made in its first century, including allowing women into the library and building upon Harvard’s library system to include a network of libraries encompassing multiple schools.
Thomas also encouraged library patrons to make use of its many resources. “This is your library,” she said. “I hope you will come and visit us again.”
According to Thomas, the centennial celebration will continue throughout the year, with the Harvard Library hosting events in September and November.
At the end of Thomas’s speech, attendees sang “Happy Birthday” to the library.
“I think Mrs. Widener would have been proud,” said Katherine W. Gray, a conservation technician at Widener.

Daniel J. Meltzer ’72, a professor at Harvard Law School who previously served as a legal adviser to the Obama administration, died late last month of cancer. He was 63.
Meltzer attended both the College and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. According to Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, Meltzer graduated from the Law School at the top of his class.
After working as a law clerk at the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, Meltzer returned to the Law School to join its faculty in 1982. As a professor, he was known for teaching a course on federal courts and the federal system which, according to Minnow, covers one of the most technically difficult subjects in the field of public law.
Meltzer is remembered by colleagues as a superb teacher, lawyer, and friend.
“He was just a delightful human being. He was the sort human being you wish every human being would be,” said Law School professor Richard H. Fallon, a close friend of Meltzer who co-taught the federal courts and federal system course with him.
“His co-authors view him as the touchstone of excellence and analytic rigor,” Minow said.
Both Fallon and Minow added that Meltzer was universally adored by his students. “The very best students sought out opportunities to take courses with him, thinking, ‘If I can learn to meet Meltzer's standards, it will make make me a better lawyer and better human being,’” Fallon said.
According to Minow, Meltzer was extremely devoted and kind to his students and “never too busy to talk.”
“His kindness is a quality that people across the community describe,” she said, adding that he is remembered this way not only at Harvard, but at the White House as well.
A memorial service for Meltzer was held at the Law School on Wednesday. Many notable figures in the field of law from Harvard and Washington, D.C., attended, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice and former Law School dean Elena Kagan.
Meltzer is survived by his wife, Ellen Semonoff, and his two sons, Joshua and Jonathan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Commencement three weeks past and most students gone, Kennedy School of Government faculty and staff are working alongside an incessant “banging” noise as construction on the school’s dramatic campus expansion is underway.
The construction project, which kicked off with a groundbreaking ceremony on May 7 and is expected to go through fall 2017, is estimated to cost $126 million, according to Kennedy School Executive Dean John A. Haigh. The school has commitments from donors totaling about $115 to $120 million already, Haigh said, and aims to fund the entire project through philanthropy to avoid the financial pressures of incurring debt.
When construction is completed, the remodeled Kennedy School campus is expected to feature an elevated courtyard and three new buildings to connect existing Taubman, Rubenstein, Littauer, and Belfer buildings, adding 77,000 square feet of new building space, according to preliminary plans submitted to the City of Cambridge last year.
According to Haigh, the Kennedy School’s courtyard will be inaccessible until the end of construction, which currently involves putting in foundations and sawcutting portions of a concrete slab that runs from Eliot Street to Memorial Drive.
The expansion effort, which features prominently in the school’s $500 million capital campaign, will be one of the lasting legacies of outgoing school Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, who will depart from his post at the end of the month. According to Haigh, however, the project only recently became one of the school’s priorities—within the past three or four years.
“As we started to work towards our academic plan, we felt we didn’t necessarily have the facilities that would enable us to achieve those elements of the academic plan,” Haigh said in a March interview. “And then as we were talking to some of our major supporters, they felt like we had an opportunity to transform the campus to support the academic plan.”
A major goal of the new physical space, according to Academic Dean for Teaching and Curriculum Suzanne Cooper, is to facilitate a sort of active, experiential learning that many of the Kennedy School’s old horseshoe-shaped, lecture-style auditoriums cannot easily support.
“Active learning—engaged, collaborative, team-based, group-based problem-solving—really is an opportunity to take the greatest advantage of that time we have together,” Cooper said. “But in a classroom where everybody is facing forward…that structure does not lend itself very well to small groups working on a problem together, and having lots of small groups in that classroom working on aspects of the problem simultaneously.”
The new classrooms aim to accommodate both traditional lecture formats and small group work, with two tiers of seats that each have a conventional forward-facing row in front of sets of small group tables. Cooper emphasized that faculty members would be able to navigate around the room more easily and even project selected group work to the whole class.
Three sets of initial experiments with this layout and teaching approach at a repurposed Kennedy School function room, two One Brattle Square swing classrooms, and the recently renovated Starr Auditorium have all gone well, according to Cooper, with faculty requesting to teach in the venues.

Harvard has jumped into reality—er, supposedly reality—TV.
A group of students have produced an undergraduate dating show dubbed “The Crimson Bachelorette,” a seemingly satirical Harvard version of the ABC program. The first episode debuted on YouTube this month.
We’ll give you a quick rundown. Chase Sui Wonders ’18 is the bachelorette, and the show follows the rising sophomore and her 10 potential suitors in their supposed quest to find true love at Harvard. The show describes the contestants with terms as lovely as “milk taster” and “reptile in human skin,” while Wonders herself is labeled as someone who “tells people she votes independent,” a “sudoku prodigy” and “Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year.” (Watch out, Amy Poehler.)
In the show’s first episode, now available online, Wonders and the 10 contestants first attend a cocktail party, where the contestants try their best to impress her.
Their attempts are admirable: Contestant Gilbert J. Wassermann ’18 serenades Wonders on the mandolin, while contestant Spenser Goodman ’15 shows off his extra-short Chubbies shorts. (Wonders’s take: “He talks about shorts a little more frequently than I’d like him to.”)
Afterwards, contestants gather for a meeting of “The Elder Council,” when they vote one contestant off of the show. Producers then come in and seemingly arbitrarily kick off another contestant (spoiler: The show might be rigged).
Wonders then shares a shot of 2 percent milk with the four final contestants.
We at Flyby would give this show a 10/10 for production value and cinematography, 9/10 for captions and one-liners, and 0/10 for inclusivity of the lactose intolerant. And it deserves a nod for its accurate portrayal of the prevalence of Chubbies at Harvard.
Check back for our review of Episode 2, out later this week.
