After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On her latest effort, “London Queen,” British export Charli XCX marvels at her newfound success across the pond: “I never thought I’d be living in the USA / Doing things the American way.” Indeed, the songstress’s utter domination of international pop charts, buoyed by her appearance on Iggy Azalea’s ubiquitous summer jam “Fancy” and the irresistible, sing-along chorus of her own “Boom Clap,” has been both unexpected and meteoric. XCX’s newest track, however, could slightly hamper her rapid ascent to stardom.
“London Queen,” off of XCX’s eagerly anticipated sophomore major-label release, “Sucker,” represents a stark change in sound for the artist. Though both her 2013 commercial debut, “True Romance,” and “London Queen” are saturated with bubblegum pop and an undeniable, unapologetic girl-power message, the latter eschews her typical army of synthesizers and shimmering electronic aesthetic for hand-claps and a barrage of electric guitars. With the relentless drumbeat and vocals imbued with tongue-in-cheek rebelliousness, XCX seems to be abandoning her trademark slick, beat-heavy production for a more raw, pseudo-punk vibe. Unfortunately, the result is strident, irritating, and most egregiously, unoriginal. While XCX endeavors to paint herself as the hip lovechild of Blondie and Bow Wow Wow, she instead sounds like a poor man’s Avril Lavigne.
XCX is definitely talented, but her growing success is most attributable to her unique fusion of electronica and debauchery-glorifying lyrics, as displayed on her first album. If the “London Queen” aspires to cement her place amongst American pop royalty, she should further cultivate the singular musical identity that first endeared her to the public—plucky, electro-pop pixie—rather than emulate her pop-punk predecessors.
“Sucker” is due out Dec. 12 via Asylum Records.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The title of psychedelic rock group Foxygen’s latest album, “…And Star Power,” gives a concise summary of this work: fully fleshed pieces that are interrupted mid-sentence, combined with a reemergence of ’70s-era love. Their experimentalism is neatly balanced with an ear for melody and a genuine enthusiasm for pure rock and roll. Although at times the nonchalance of their musicianship seems overdone, Foxygen’s latest uses its 24 tracks to experiment to their hearts’ content.
The album opens with an instrumental, triumphant track that fits the mold of progressive rock. The minute-long track ends abruptly, but the atmosphere of progressive rock reemerges several times at later points on the album, interspersed with other, odder sonic landscapes. For example, the least experimental song of the album, “How Can You Really,” embraces upbeat psychedelic pop. Foxygen’s sense of ironic humor emerges strongly on this track. One can relish, for example, the combination of a ’70s pop melody with lyrics that glibly profess, “It's my fault, it's your fault too / How 'bout you go and find somebody who can love you.” Tracks such as “Star Power III: What Are We Good for” and “Everyone Needs Love” have a similar texture as “How Can You Really,” but the lyricism in these tracks is not as remarkable.
In fact, the lyrics in general are quite forgettable. Take, for instance, the refrain of “Coulda Been My Love”: “You coulda been my love (Coulda been my love) / Coulda been my love (Coulda been my love) / Coulda been my love (Coulda been my love).” The repetitive chorus does mesh well with the somber piano and sighing female backing vocals of the track, but ultimately such writing does not impress. “Hot Summer” also disappoints in this respect, with mumbled lyrics that are inarticulate as well as unsubstantial. Foxygen fails to use lyricism to its full potential, and instead of fitting snugly into the album’s sound world, the lyrics often fall completely flat.
But the album’s sonic landscape shines better than the group’s lyricism. “…And Star Power” gives one the impression of a few friends recording some original tunes in someone’s basement. This is definitely intentional; the transitions between tracks are often abrupt and unfinished, and a large number of the tracks include samples of hazy, radio-static conversation. In the end of “Coulda Been My Love,” for example, the snippets of human voices create an experience not unlike scanning through radio stations. In others, such as “Cannibal Holocaust” or “You & I,” the band sounds as if they’re rehearsing brand new material. It’s refreshing to hear music that cements a kind of authentic experience in the listener. So often, albums sound like the product of hundreds upon hundreds of hours of practice, thought, and constructive criticism. “…And Star Power” abandons that approach, offering instead a glimpse of raw creativity. This is not to say that Foxygen does not rehearse; in fact, they most likely design that aesthetic of organic experience from the ground up, creating an authentic sound.
Foxygen’s experimentalism is a strong component of the album. Vague, inarticulate, boyish screams in the background add an edgy atmosphere to tracks like “Freedom II.” At times, the dynamic chord progression quickly falls apart into slow, pared-to-the-bone guitar solos. Foxygen subverts many expectations of listeners by simply playing what they want and avoiding conventions. This can make the album frustrating to listen to, but it is a fresh change from albums that are too polished.
“…And Star Power” is a continuation of Foxygen’s method: artfully constructed songs that aim to both remind people of an earlier time yet also challenge the genre through experimentation. Mostly, this technique gels well with the lyrics, melodies, and moments of unconventional riffing. Foxygen deftly creates a sound world rooted in the feel-good tradition of psychedelic rock without sacrificing their sense of innovation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Can you lift that chair like you’re gonna throw it at him?”
It’s 9:00 p.m. on a Friday; in the west lobby of the American Repertory Theater’s Loeb Drama Center, temporarily transformed into a makeshift stage, the cast of “Little Murders” is heading into the night’s third hour of rehearsal. Director Shira Milikowsky, artistic associate at the ART, is instructing actors Juliana N. Sass ’17 and Matthew J. Bialo ’15. The three have spent the last two hours enacting and reenacting a single scene—each word painstakingly analyzed, each gesture calculated for greatest effect, each line tried dozens of different ways.
“Okay, let’s start again. Let yourself go—see what comes.”
“Little Murders” is the outcome of this year’s Visiting Director’s Project, a collaboration between the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and the ART. Since 2003, the VDP has brought accomplished directors from the ART and beyond to work alongside Harvard students; past productions run the gamut from “Romeo and Juliet” to “Accidental Death of an Anarchist.” Participating in the VDP show offers Harvard undergraduates exposure, experience, and the chance to perform on the Loeb Mainstage, but most crucially, the opportunity to learn from a seasoned professional.
Each of the student actors, directors, and producers interviewed for this article cited this opportunity as one of the most rewarding aspects of being involved in the show. Due to its lack of a dramatic arts concentration, Harvard can be a difficult place for aspiring actors, producers, directors, and theater technicians who face the dual challenge of succeeding academically in one field while seeking to become proficient in another. The Visiting Director’s Project is one attempt to counter this issue. Expectations for the production are high and the time commitment formidable, but for the students involved in this year’s VDP it is well worth it—the closest thing to a pre-professional experience they will get at Harvard.
TWISTED, DARK, AND COMEDIC
“Little Murders,” written by cartoonist Jules Feiffer, takes place in a slightly dystopian New York City in a not-quite-dystopian near future. The play tells the story of one family trying to hold it together in the face of anarchy, violence, and crime, with disastrous results. “We’ve been calling it ‘the darkest of dark comedies,’” co-producer Magdalene M. Zier ’16 says.
In many ways, the Newquists are the traditional mid-century sitcom family—mother, father, son, and daughter—but Feiffer’s script and now Milikowsky’s staging work to upend that paradigm. In one twist, Elizabeth Leimkuhler ’15 plays the role of the father, Carol, while Mark J. Mauriello ’15 is cast as Marjorie, the mother. According to Milikowsky, the decision was entirely unexpected. “It wasn’t like I had this thought, ‘Oh, let’s have a man play the mother,’” she says. “What happened was that we did callbacks, and I thought, ‘The person who essentializes Marjorie for me, in my gut, is Mark. And the person who’s kinda feeling like Carol is Liz.’” Milikowsky initially resisted the idea, concerned that it would feel like a gimmick or fail to mesh with the fabric of the play; it took the support of co-producer Garrett C. Allen ’16 and the rest of the production team to solidify the decision. “Garrett looked at me and said, ‘It sounds like you want us to talk you out of this, but that you want to do it, and we just want you to know that we’re up for it. We’re behind you. Let’s do it.’”
Milikowsky’s decision compelled Leimkuhler and Mauriello to push themselves as actors.  Both express complex relationships to their characters, born in part of the challenge of depicting a different gender. “I had to learn a new approach to identifying with a character,” Leimkuhler says. “I didn’t want to get up there and be a caricature of a man.”
Mauriello offers similar sentiments. “I know that part of the humor is because of the cross-dressing—‘Hey, there’s a guy in a dress’—but I want the audience to feel like it goes beyond that. Maybe it doesn’t matter if Marjorie is actually male or female; the point is that she’s trying so hard to hold on to that mother role, just to keep her family together.”
KIND OF A FUNNY STORY
When “Little Murders” premiered in 1967 on Broadway it was a flop, putting on only seven performances before closing. When revived off-Broadway in 1969, however, it became a huge success, running for 400 performances over two years. “The play is not of its time; it was actually about five seconds before its time,” says Milikowsky. “The difference between those two productions is that 1968 happened in the middle, and with all the assassinations of that year and the riots and the violence and the escalation of Vietnam, people who came to see that show in ’69 were like, ‘Oh yeah, we totally get this.’”
While things have changed between 1967 and 2014, Milikowsky believes that many of the social issues broached by “Little Murders” persist in various forms to this day. “[The play’s] examination of gender and who has the power, and how status is divided among gender, and how that is being shaken up between genders is still very present in our conversation,” she says.
Zier points out another way in which “Little Murders” is relatable for modern audiences: “A big theme is gun violence. We associate it with this world of anarchy, but it’s clear that it infiltrates our own lives. The play really takes a hard look at that problem. What happens when violence becomes the norm?”
These are serious themes to take on, but “Little Murders” tempers its graver concerns with a hefty helping of comedy. “It’s a really fast-paced humor,” Milikowsky says. “In art, I’ve always liked getting to serious things through laughter.”
Comedy is notoriously difficult to get right, though. “It’s hard, because we have characters in these very farcical situations, but we never want to let the characters themselves become farce,” Leimkuhler explains. “Even when the situation is funny and obviously ridiculous to us, it’s life and death for that character.”
Milikowsky’s experience in comedic staging has proven vital to helping the actors navigate this tricky theatrical territory. “Shira is very, very specific with every single beat that happens throughout the show,” Samuel B. Clark ’15 says.
For Milikowsky, this kind of exactitude is essential for a comedic production. “Comedy is timing,” she says. “There have been times that we’ve spent 45 minutes on a double take—who does the double take, in what direction, and at what tempo.” The hope is that all of this work will result in a production that is as precisely staged as a dance performance and devastatingly funny without losing any of its bite. “We want this to be the kind of performance where you laugh, and then you feel slightly uncomfortable about having laughed,” Leimkuhler says.
PATH FINDING
Theatrical skills like the comedic accuracy described above can be learned—but not as part of a Harvard student’s primary field of study. On a list of concentrations that includes Germanic languages and literatures, folklore and mythology, environmental science and public policy, and five kinds of biology, perhaps the most surprising absence is dramatic arts. Harvard students who want to go into acting, production, directing, design, and other performance-related careers are obligated to write papers, study for midterms, and keep up with all the required work for their concentration while using their free time and elective classes to pick up the skills and experience they need.
Weeks spent rehearsing for upwards of six hours a day likely means that some work is left undone, some tests not studied for, some sacrifices made. Yet despite the challenges of the situation, there are also benefits to pursuing theater at Harvard. “This is an amazing place to be if you want to be in the arts,” Sass says. “It might not be an obvious place to be, but the most important thing is to be around people who inspire you and are passionate about what they do.”
Assistant director of “Little Murders” Joey R. Longstreet ’16 describes the Harvard-Radcliffe Drama Club’s status as a thriving, student-run group as another asset for those interested in careers in the arts. “There’s a crazy number of shows put on each semester, so there are always chances to be involved,” he says. He also speaks highly of the few dramatic arts classes offered each semester under the aegis of a dramatic arts secondary, particularly a directing class he took during his freshman year that was taught by Diane Paulus, artistic director of the ART (Milikowsky is teaching a directing class this spring). The Visiting Director’s Project, of course, is another valuable opportunity. “It’s as close to a professional experience as you’re going to get,” Longstreet explains.
Others on the cast, including Leimkuhler and Mauriello, highlight the ART’s contribution to Harvard student theater. “The ART is the best regional theater in New England,” Mauriello says. “I’ve been interning here since sophomore year, and it’s taught me so much about acting, production, and the theater world as a whole.”
“I think that [the difficulty of focusing on theater at Harvard] can be a positive thing,” Leimkuhler says. “You can’t just sign up for the major, make your way through four years, and then graduate and realize ‘Hey, I don’t actually want to do this.’ It’s a constant process of re-affirming that decision; you have to keep going out and auditioning for things, getting involved. You have to find your own path.”
The process of finding that path is familiar to Milikowsky. As an undergraduate at Yale, she was originally a history major. “I loved acting and theater, but I never saw it as something I could do with my life,” she explains. “I thought I’d go to law school.” It wasn’t until her junior year, when she directed a play as a favor to a friend, that she decided her future lay in theater. “‘Just come to the auditions,’ he said. These women were coming in and reading these parts, and I started working with them, and it just felt so good. It was like acting, which I loved, but all the parts that made me uncomfortable were gone.”
“All the things I was good at—seeing the big picture, and communicating storylines, and getting other people excited—were part of directing, and it was clear pretty immediately,” Milikowsky continues. “So that changed everything.”
Following this experience, Milikowsky stopped acting, switched her major to theater studies, and “started directing like mad.” After graduating, she got an MFA in directing from Columbia and then stayed in New York. “I was working all the time, having day jobs, assistant directing on productions, and then putting on shows in basements with my friends at night. It was a lot of fun, but it was tiring.” Then she heard about the Luce Foundation’s Luce Scholars Program, which sends young Americans to countries in Asia for a year. The age cutoff was 30; Milikowsky was 29. She applied.
“At the time, when I said I was moving to Korea, everyone in my life was like, ‘What are you doing?’ I just needed something—it’s important to have a career path, but it’s also important to deviate from that path,” Milikowsky says.
Milikowsky ended up spending a year in Seoul, working as a visiting director at a theater and teaching a class of students. Partway through the year, she received an email from Diane Paulus, with whom she’d worked on the Broadway production of “HAIR,” encouraging her to come to the ART. Three days after returning from Seoul, she packed her things and moved to Boston, where she’s spent the last three years.
INDUSTRY STANDARD
“I don’t think we’ve dug all the way into the complexity of what she’s saying here,” Milikowsky says. It’s late on Friday night, and rehearsal is in full swing. “This play just keeps reinventing itself, and that’s what’s so exciting. I think you guys should be looking at each other when she says that line—do you feel that too?” Nods go around the room, actors reset, and the newest interpretation of the line is tried.
This collaborative, discussion-based approach is the cornerstone of Milikowsky’s style. “Shira is the kind of director who will have a conversation with you about why your character does what they do,” Clark says. “She’s really good—more than any other director I’ve had—about sitting down and having those talks.”
“Shira just knows what to say to actors to get them to understand the story they’re trying to tell,” Bialo says. “She has an amazing way of asking exactly the right questions to help you access that story.”
For Longstreet, who hopes to become a professional director, working alongside Milikowsky has been a particularly valuable opportunity. “It’s been a really exciting experience, and I’m just trying to learn all I can,” Longstreet says. “It’s so great to work with someone who’s had so much experience at the professional level. Directing is such a hard thing to describe, since it can mean a lot of different things, but Shira is really just amazing at interacting with actors—not coming in and saying ‘This is what I think it is,’ but making it really a discussion between her and the actors about these characters.”
In lieu of a dramatic arts concentration, technical training and experiences that approximate professional theater work can be difficult to come by for Harvard undergraduates. But the VDP presents a unique opportunity to help resolve that deficit, providing students with a valuable window into the world they hope to enter. Though Milikowsky’s particular directorial style is unique, the experience of working with a professional director is a more general reward—one that these students can carry with them as they pursue career ambitions not reflected by their diplomas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Judge” is a movie that could have been released 10 or 20 years ago. It tells a classic, if not overused tale—the inevitable clash between the ambitious son who has always craved the love and respect of his father and the patriarch who has always been proud of his son but could never bring himself to express this love. There are no paradigm-shifting twists or flashy gimmicks. “The Judge” tells an old story the old-fashioned way, and that’s why it’s so refreshing.
Robert Downey Jr. stars in the film as Hank Palmer, who reads like many of Downey Jr.’s recent characters—a misanthropic and insensitive but extremely talented defense attorney who isn’t afraid to say, “Innocent people can’t afford me.” Unsurprisingly, Hank is also not a family man. He is getting divorced from his wife, and the death of his mother brings him back to his small-town childhood home of Carlinville, Indiana for the first time in many years. Fate, however, conspires to bring Hank out of his bubble. “Judge” Joseph Palmer, Hank’s father (Robert Duvall), is accused of murder, and the film follows the uneasy partnership that ensues between father and son, client and counsel.
“The Judge” possesses a truly stellar ensemble cast. Robert Duvall, at the ripe age of 83, shows that there is still plenty of Lt. Colonel Kilgore left in him, and Downey Jr. matches Duvall blow for blow in his first truly dramatic role since 2009’s “The Soloist.” Both give stunning performances that show off the entire spectrum from subtlety to explosiveness. The seamless chemistry between the two actors comes to a climax in a chill-inducing confrontation which confirms that, indeed, this is a battle of true cinematic heavyweights.
Supporting the two Roberts is a remarkable lineup of veterans, including Billy Bob Thornton, Vera Farmiga and Vincent D’Onofrio. Dax Shepard also proves to be an unexpected asset for the film as a hilariously incompetent beta-male lawyer who is far more knowledgeable about antiques than the law. Shepard’s character is mostly comic relief, but most of the supporting characters are just as well-rounded as the two leading men, with complete and meaningful stories of their own that refuse to be defined briefly or simply. Such depth of characterization throughout the cast is both hard to come by and crucial for a character-centered drama.
Director David Dobkin does an admirable job of wrapping the fabric of the film around his all-star lineup of actors, which is somewhat surprising. Known mostly for raunchy comedies like “Wedding Crashers,” Dobkin is not the first person that comes to mind when one thinks of a family courtroom drama starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. The pathos of the film is a little forced at times, particularly with some choppy storyboarding and score integration. In some scenes, there is also the sense that the film is struggling to define itself as either a dramatic comedy or a comedic drama. Overall, however, the film manages to capture the dramatic atmosphere well while injecting Dobkin’s well-trained grasp of comedic timing. Credit also goes to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who has worked on every Steven Spielberg film since “Schindler’s List.”
“The Judge” is a film free of fluff and misdirection. It has no high concept. It isn’t topical or controversial. There is no big reveal. “The Judge” is a simple story about a family lost and a family found. But instead of being boring, “The Judge” is timeless. Its first-rate acting, witty screenplay, and steady direction prove that films do not need to reinvent the wheel to be excellent. Sleep easy, audiences. Old-fashioned storytelling is alive and well in Hollywood.

The Bach Society Orchestra has been synonymous with high-caliber chamber performance at Harvard for the past 60 years. Unhappily, BachSoc’s Oct. 10 concert, while containing some shining moments of musicianship, was a somewhat ragged affair and fell somewhat short of the ensemble’s usual brilliance.
The program itself, while presenting no coherent theme or idea in its piece selection, featured three fine pieces that steered clear of being overplayed concert staples or excessively exotic, both of which can pose problems for premiere chamber groups. The compositions provided ample opportunity for the orchestra to display its talent: Mozart’s “Overture to ‘La Clemenza di Tito,’” Ralph Vaughan Williams’s “Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis,” and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 2 all cater to BachSoc’s typically superb strings and present occasions for display of skill on the individual and group level. Unfortunately, execution errors of varying magnitude marred much of the performance.
A major difficulty was the fact that the orchestra did not seem to respond well to the direction of conductor and Society Music Director Sasha G. Scolnik-Brower ’17. Scolnik-Brower’s sensitivity to the demands of each passage was remarkable. Lagging tempo and imbalances in dynamics were met with immediate attention; his directions were clear but restrained, not distracting from the performance at all. Unfortunately, in spite of Scolnik-Brower’s best efforts, the musicians did not translate this sensitivity into their own performance. This sluggishness in response was especially evident in Mozart’s “Overture”: the woodwinds’ dynamics were unsubtle, alternating between overwhelming and inaudible. This unfortunate circumstance was underlined by sluggishness in phrasing and mild tempo problems.
Slow and unclear execution was a pervasive problem throughout the concert. For example, in the first movement of the Beethoven symphony, the violins sounded joyless and nearly funereal in sections typically played with brightness and precision of phrasing. Individual errors, including violin squeaks, took away from the performance as well. The second movement was especially beset by difficulties in the French horn section. After a garbled cue near the end of the movement, the section persistently struggled through the rest of the piece, distracting from competent performances from other sections with occasionally bleating tones.
While these technical problems were frustrating, the concert still had some glorious highlights.  The second piece, Williams’s “Fantasia,” was a true joy to hear. The piece itself is a charming departure from the two older pieces it accompanied on the program, featuring a haunting Phrygian mode theme elaborated by call-and-response between sections. The performance was nearly flawless, with especially strong showings by first violinist Michael S. Hughes ’15 and first violist Richard J. Millett ’15, who were tasked with navigating the piece’s most difficult contrapuntal passages. The passion of the musicians for this piece was clearly evident, and the expressiveness displayed in this piece was unequaled almost anywhere else in the show.
Nevertheless, this concert was not BachSoc’s strongest showing. While a disappointing start to the orchestra’s 60th anniversary season, there is time for improvement and a return to the standard set in prior years. It is clear that the raw talent is as present as ever; it merely remains for the orchestra to synthesize it into the professional-grade product that audiences have come to expect.

“There’s definitely nothing like dancing to live music,” says Hannah S. Firestone ’16, co-director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company. For the first time in several years, all the pieces in the company’s fall show, “Tempo,” are set to songs that will be played live by student musicians.
“Tempo,” which will run from Oct. 16 to 17 at the Harvard Dance Center, showcases a variety of musical genres and modern dance styles, including classical, jazz, and contemporary. “It’s a lot of fun to see the musicians and what they bring to it and to see how they work with the dancers,” Firestone says.
In one routine choreographed by HRMDC co-director Julia K. Cataldo ’15, around a dozen dancers glide to the uplifting yet pensive sounds of four selections from the “Pride and Prejudice” (2005) film score, performed by a single pianist. “[Julia has] been talking about what our faces look like when we dance,” says Greta A. Wong ’18, who performs in the number. “She wants us to just feel the music, and she’s saying when we feel something particularly beautiful, we should smile and just do what feels natural.”
The piece centers on connections the dancers build with each other, the music, and the stage itself. “[It’s] about the relationships between people, relationships in space, and…feeling who’s been in the space before you and who’s there with you now,” Wong says. “Dance is in the moment, and once it’s over, it’s over. That moment’s a thing that will never happen again in the same way, and I think it’s amplified with the live music.”
The entire production is designed to transition from moment to moment as audience members reflect on what they just have seen and then immerse themselves in something completely new. “There’s a lot of shifting around, and it’s exciting,” HRMDC member Lia F. Kaynor ’17 says.
Kaynor and Michael S. Gellman ’17 will be combining improvised music and improvised movement in another routine. Alternating from piano playing to dancing to moving in silence, the performers will be using two different artistic media. “[The piece is] about spatial construction and spatial destruction—what does that mean in your body, how can you translate that into a series of movements—and then tying that to sonic construction and destruction,” Kaynor says. “It’s not about having a story necessarily; it’s really about just the movement itself and then that connection to the sound itself and then how you can play with those relationships.”
Several performers, including Kaynor, act as both dancers and musicians during the show, and this fluidity highlights the crossover between the two art forms. “Tempo,” the name of the show itself, also references the links between music and dance. “There is this common vocabulary between the two art forms, and it’s…a relief to see it all come together and translated into the different modes of art,” Kaynor says.
Modern music also features in “Tempo.” During the performance, a group of student musicians will perform a medley of five contemporary songs for a piece choreographed by Firestone. Firestone first worked with the musicians on the songs—“The Moon” by Priscilla Ahn, “The Rip Tide” by Beirut, “Truth” by Alexander Ebert, “The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!” by Sufjan Stevens, and “Fake Empire” by The National—and then taught the movements to the dancers. Now she is putting both groups together.
“I have a lot of really, really talented—very gung-ho—musicians who are willing to experiment with it and play with it and change it around,” Firestone says. “It gives totally new life and new breath to the pieces, and I think all of the dancers are excited and grateful for that new spark when they’re dancing.”
HRMDC members emphasize the value in dancing to live music, noting that many college students do not have such an opportunity. “If you’re always practicing with a recording, then you can get used to the exact way it’s going to sound every single time,” Kaynor says. “But with live music, it really opens another dimension of interactivity, and I think that’s really engaging for an audience to see as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, media outlet Campus Reform posted a video in which a representative from the organization asked several Harvard students a seemingly simple question: “What is the bigger threat to world peace: America, or ISIS?” The students took that question seriously, offering frank critiques of American foreign policy. The Fox News opinion show Outnumbered then picked up on the story, releasing an episode in which guest commentator John Rich derided the students interviewed as a “bunch of snot-nosed brats.” Another commentator, Andrea Tantaros, expressed dismay that students were increasingly exposed to anti-American viewpoints in schools.
To anyone familiar with the polarized political environment of this country, the fact that a heavily edited series of student interviews were blown out of proportion to such an extreme degree should come as no surprise. To lament the prevalence of shoddy journalistic practices or the use of college students as political cannon fodder is to want for originality. What the actions of Campus Reform and Fox News do reveal, more broadly, is just how the kneejerk tendency to vitriol often precludes meaningful dialogue in American politics. We all have the right to disagree, but we have a concomitant responsibility to teach and indeed to learn from others.
Campus Reform and especially Fox each failed to uphold the latter half of that bargain. To dismiss these students’ viewpoints out of hand as “liberal elitism” for the sake of a political agenda was to do viewers a disservice. It’s useful to pause and recognize that the students made some good points. The question was not which entity is “worse” or “more evil”—the answer to which would undoubtedly be ISIS. Instead, the question deserved nuance, and the United States’ actions in the Middle East should be recognized as one of many factors that may have made ISIS’s rise possible. Outnumbered could have offered a cogent critique of that argument, but chose not to. While the students approached the question given them seriously, Outnumbered approached the students in a manner that was anything but serious.
Public discourse suffers in an environment where ideas are discounted off-hand due to the identity of the speaker. Outnumbered is not alone in this—for every conservative host who dismisses liberals as “elitist,” you can probably find a liberal host dismissing conservatives for similarly vapid reasons. A less combative public discourse probably won’t lead to consensus, but it can help us develop our own thoughts and understand those of others. Outnumbered had a chance to engage in this kind of discourse, to engage and critique in a thoughtful, revealing manner. Instead, in an example far too commonplace, they chose to score points in an unnecessary culture war. Their viewers, and the country, are worse off for that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now many of you have probably seen Campus Reform’s interviews with Harvard students. The question posed to students on the Science Center Plaza: “What is a greater threat to world peace, ISIS or America?” The results were predictable. College students predisposed to a pacifist viewpoint attempt to give a concise, nuanced answer to a silly question, and are made to sound like flag-burning radicals.
America and ISIS are impossible to compare. One has been the world’s greatest economic, military, and political superpower for seven decades, and the other is a band of jihadists that came into existence after most of us began college. When one examines the destabilizing effect that each has had on the world at large, the answer is clear. America has intervened in more countries, supported more resistance movements, and toppled more leaders than ISIS. If the interviewer had asked students which entity is pledged to a doctrine of violence, or which is the least morally admirable, I would assume that most would choose ISIS. Some would still douse Old Glory in kerosene, but most, I think, would recognize that the United States has been a greater force for good in the world than the Islamic State. After all, we are currently helping the Christians and Yazidis that ISIS would like to massacre. Religious liberty and the protection of minorities are worthwhile goals.
America is not wholly bad, or even mostly bad. In fact, we are quite good. One of the students interviewed explained her answer with reference to “American imperialism” and our attempts to secure oil supplies in the Middle East. I find that uncompelling. Americans are not imperialists. There was a time when that label would have applied, those days at the dawn of the twentieth century when we existed in the shadow of the British Empire and tried to compensate by seizing territories such as Puerto Rico or the Philippines for ourselves.
But in the years since Vietnam, that is less true. We tried to expiate some of our prior sins in Latin America by returning the Panama Canal to local control. When we intervened in the Persian Gulf in 1990, we did so only after Iraq invaded another sovereign country–and then refrained from toppling the regime in Baghdad. Charles Krauthammer, the Washington Post columnist, put it best when he said that, “It is absurd to apply the word to to a people whose first instinct upon arriving on anyone’s soil is to demand an exit strategy.”
In the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, many liberals claimed that our sole justification for invasion was our thirst for oil. But last year Iraq was sixth on the list of countries from which we import oil, constituting a mere 4.4 percent of total imports–and its share has dropped over the past decade as we have made efforts to diversify our energy sources. When we went to war, President Bush said we had three objectives: “[T]o disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.” Those goals seem honorable enough, and the government of Iraq is better today than it was in 2003. In the midst of the violence in northern Iraq this summer, Americans might have missed something pretty astounding: Prime Minister Nour al-Maliki peacefully relinquished his office to Haider al-Abadi. In spite of its troubles, Iraq is one of the few functioning democracies in the Middle East, and it is doubtful that would be the case if not for our ill-informed (but not ill-intentioned) intervention.
Now, I do not believe that America should send in the troops anytime we dislike the leader of a particular country. President Obama has deemed this the “whack-a-mole” strategy of geopolitics, and he is right. Yet there is a time and a place for action. This past summer, I was handed a flier by a tearful woman in front of the White House who was begging for intervention on behalf of Syrian Christians. When a nation resolves to defend abroad the principles that it holds dear, it is bound to err. But that is no justification for husbanding our resources here at home and refusing to intervene on behalf of victimized peoples. A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Racist profiling in law enforcement has struck again. Less than two months after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, the release of a dashboard-camera video showing a white South Carolina highway patrolman shooting an unarmed black motorist should remind America that the case of Ferguson, Mo., is not an uncommon one. Racist policing is a systemic problem in a national criminal justice system that all too often demonstrates injustice rather than justice.
In the video, the police officer, Sean Groubert, asks Levar Jones for his driver’s license after pulling Jones over for an alleged seat belt violation. Jones reaches into his pocket, realizes his license is still in the car, and quickly ducks into his car to retrieve it. Believing Jones is reaching for a gun, Groubert yells for him to get out of the car, then opens fire before Jones even turns around. Groubert fires four shots, the final one after Jones has already raised his hands above his head. To anyone watching the video, the horrific excess of Groubert’s actions is unquestionable.
It would be easy to dismiss Groubert’s actions as those of a rogue cop, a mere bad apple. We could condemn him individually and send him to jail for his actions (assuming a jury convicts him, which is by no means guaranteed). We could applaud the rapid response of the South Carolina Highway Patrol in firing and arresting Groubert, and we could forget about the incident.
But to do so would be to ignore the structural racism, the socially dominant stereotypes that caused Groubert to see a gun-wielding criminal where there was no one but an innocent, unarmed civilian.
As Groubert confronted Jones, he carried with him the stereotype of what legal scholar Katheryn Russell-Brown has termed the “criminalblackman.” The result of decades of the War on Drugs, in which politicians and the media have constructed and reinforced the idea that black men are dangerous criminals, the concept of the criminalblackman is deeply ingrained in the psyche of our society.
Michelle Alexander, author of “The New Jim Crow,” explains that “law enforcement officials, no less than the rest of us, have been exposed to the racially charged political rhetoric and media imagery associated with the drug war.” Informed by such a prominent stereotype, deplorable police errors are essentially inevitable.
So, with Jones’s blackness being Groubert’s only reason for thinking he might be armed, the police officer immediately assumed that Jones was reaching into his car not for his license but for a weapon. As this rationale is obviously unacceptable, Groubert’s lawyer has attempted to defend his client by stating that Jones reached into the car “aggressively.” While Jones did turn quickly, there can be little doubt that, had a white man acted in the same manner, his actions would not have been described as aggressive, the police officer would not have assumed he was armed, and he certainly would not have been fired upon.
The obvious racial profiling of the police officer must also call into question the premise on which Jones was pulled over in the first place. It is not clear whether Jones did indeed commit a seat belt violation, but even if he did, there is a substantial chance he would not have been pulled over had he been white. Police officers consistently use minor traffic violations as a pretext to stop minorities—but not whites—and search for drugs.
In her book, Alexander cites several studies to demonstrate this phenomenon. One of these, conducted on the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1990s, shows that “15 percent of all drivers on the New Jersey Turnpike were racial minorities, yet 42 percent of all stops and 73 percent of all arrests were of black motorists—despite the fact that blacks and whites violated traffic laws at almost exactly the same rate.” In addition, whites were actually more likely to be found with drugs, ruling out drug policing as an acceptable excuse for this race-based harassment.
Levar Jones was not seriously injured, but he could easily have been killed for driving while black and moving too quickly to produce his license. Racist policing, whether in the form of something as commonplace as excessive enforcement of traffic violations or of something as disturbing as the unwarranted use of force, must end. It is not enough to punish overtly racist police officers. It is not even enough to outlaw policing practices that involve racial profiling. These incidents can only stop when our society commits itself to destroying the unjust stereotype that sees black men as criminals. Only then can the Michael Browns and Levar Joneses of America go about their day without the fear of being shot by police officers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John P. Carlin, U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, spoke and answered questions about cyber threats and the Department of Justice’s continued efforts to fight terrorism Friday at Harvard Law School.
Carlin’s department, the National Security Division within the Department of Justice, was created in 2006 to create greater collaboration between prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, and the intelligence community.
The event was moderated by Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who serves on the board of directors for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the NSA’s advisory board. In the aftermath of the leak of NSA documents by former government contractor Edward J. Snowden, Zittrain asked about the extent to which the government’s intelligence gathering should be disclosed.
While Carlin acknowledged that publicly releasing information on intelligence gathering presents difficult technical challenges, he stressed the importance of agency transparency.
“I do believe that whenever possible we should try to make as clear as we can what the legal framework or parameters are,” Carlin said.
One attendee asked about the modern challenge of prosecuting those who are responsible for cyber attacks, given the potential for criminal attacks to take place anywhere in the world from behind a computer screen.
“Some folks thought that you could never show who was behind a keyboard, but we have shown that you can,” Carlin said, referencing the capabilities of intelligence-gathering agencies. “When the facts and evidence lead to someone behind a keyboard, we are going to bring charges.”
Carlin also spoke about undercover operations conducted by the intelligence community, which give agents the opportunity to see whether a person who is “talking the talk of violent extremism” will act upon his or her threats.
“In our system...we do not bring charges against someone for their views or beliefs,” Carlin said. “We will use our undercover operations to see whether the individual who has indicated a desire, a belief in violent extremism, or espouses views of a foreign terrorist organization…[will] take the actual step.”
Audience members said that the event presented an interesting depiction of the the National Security Division, yet added that Carlin avoided the moral implications of his work.
“I thought it was interesting how much of his talk was procedural and focused on the different departments and the way things are structured, as opposed to the moral and ethical questions that many of the questioners were more interested in,” said Ben Doernberg, a research assistant at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. “It was kind of worrying that there didn’t seem to be a lot of moral imagination.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an open discussion on Friday, students argued that administrators had not sufficiently alerted faculty members and teaching fellows of the nature of the racially charged, emailed death threat that several hundred Harvard affiliates received in early October.
The discussion in Phillips Brooks House, hosted by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, was the second open meeting on the threat that administrators had organized in less than a week. It drew roughly 20 students and a handful of administrators, including Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter, and Director of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey. Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning sat in the back.
Several student attendees said all professors and teaching fellows, not just students, should have been notified of the threats through an official email from administrators in response to the incident. Khurana had sent College students such an email last Wednesday. Teachers could then have been a source of emotional support for undergraduates affected by the threat, the students at the discussion said.
Khurana explained that it is the role of the assistant College deans in each of the Houses—administrators formerly known as resident deans—to communicate with individual faculty members when students need accommodations in emergencies, but attendees said that depending on the deans was impractical given the large number of students affected by the threat.
“It would be appreciated...in a situation in which it’s clear that a large portion of the campus population has been affected to send a few words to all teaching staff,” said Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a representative for Quincy House on the Undergraduate Council who serves on the Campus Safety Committee.
In response, Khurana said he would talk to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith about such a communication to teaching staff in the event of a similar emergency in the future with guidance for faculty on how to support those affected.
During the meeting, Khurana also took questions on MessageMe, Harvard’s opt-in emergency notification service, and told students that it was not used after the threat because the Harvard University Police Department did not view it as imminent.
The death threat prompted local law enforcement and the FBI to join Harvard police in its investigation. The police have since determined that the threat originated overseas.

A team of Harvard researchers and their colleagues have developed a new software platform that makes it easier for scientists to understand and analyze the many forms of cancer.
Called StratomeX, the software can be used to visualize patterns in cancer-related bioinformatics data in a more lucid and less technical manner.
The field of bioinformatics has been churning out data at a much faster pace than can be analyzed and interpreted, according to a Harvard Medical School release. Databases like the Cancer Genome Atlas are mined by sophisticated computer algorithms, which then provide a researcher with data that indicates how many cancer variants exist and which genes are associated with that type of cancer.
The output of those computer programs can be cryptic and inaccessible to researchers who lack mathematical background, according to Alexander Lex, a postdoctoral researcher and member of the team that created StratomeX.
But StratomeX—developed by researchers from the Medical School, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and two Austrian institutions, the Johannes Kepler University of Linz and the Graz University of Technology—makes that output more comprehensible.
“StratomeX is the first tool that can actually give the everyday bench scientist the power to readily perform cancer subtype analysis,” he said.
Nils Gehlenborg, a research associate in biomedical informatics at the Medical School, explained how StratomeX complements existing statistical analysis tools.
“[StratomeX] is an interface that allows users to import results precomputed by algorithms that analyze the raw data [from cancer genomics studies],” he said. “It then presents visuals to the researchers that help guide investigators through the data.”
Lex also noted that the software allows investigators to make specific queries about the data and then presents the results in a user-friendly format.
Another feature of StratomeX is a built-in adaptor that connects it directly to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This data analysis pipeline lets researchers easily import datasets and saves them time, Gehlenborg said.
According to Lex, current efforts in regards to StratomeX are dedicated to analyzing gene variants, assessing the data at the DNA sequence level in addition to the gene level, and improving the overall user-friendliness.
“It’s a work in progress,” he said.
In the future, the StratomeX team is planning to offer a version that can be run in a web browser without any prior installation.
StratomeX is available for download on the public repository, GitHub, where developers can add extensions and modifications.

Panelists from a number of Harvard’s peer institutions detailed their schools’ efforts to integrate public service and academics at a symposium sponsored by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Standing Committee on Public Service on Friday.
In response to examples of other schools’ service programs, panelist and standing committee member James T. Kloppenberg said that “it’s time for Harvard to do the same.” Kloppenberg, a history professor, clarified that the committee wants to “see Harvard follow the lead of our peer institutions.”
Representatives from Tulane University, the University of Pennsylvania, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and Duke University discussed their schools’ programs for paid summer service trips, for-credit service with classroom components, and socially conscious field research.
Panelist Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African and African American Studies, said that her department is founded on the principle of a service-oriented curriculum. She pointed to the department’s social engagement initiative, which grounds research in issues relevant to people of African descent.
Still, Kloppenberg said that Harvard is in need of a more robust public service program, and that the College’s curriculum should harness the motivation of its students for use in service work.
“What works is student engagement,” he said. “What doesn’t work is passive regurgitation of facts.”
After the event, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith—who moderated the event—said that, among the schools represented on the panel, he has heard Harvard faculty sing particular praise for the DukeEngage program at Duke.
The program provides fully funded summer service trips to more than 400 Duke undergraduates each year, according to Eric Mlyn, the executive director of DukeEngage. He added that about one quarter of the graduating class of 2014 had participated in the program, and it has become the most frequently cited reason for which Duke applicants say they are applying to the school.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email Monday that there have not been any confirmed cases of the Ebola virus on campus or in the region, just hours after Boston medical workers initiated a second quarantine in as many days for individuals suspected of exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms.
“I have been moved by the loss of life and by the courage of those who have selflessly offered their help,” wrote Khurana, recommending that students call University Health Services if they have concerned about their health.
On Sunday, officials quarantined a medical facility in Braintree for hours before doctors cleared a man feared to have been infected by the deadly virus. Workers in hazmat suits at Logan International Airport escorted five passengers exhibiting flu-like symptoms off an Emirates flight, just a day later. The Ebola outbreak, the largest in history, has affected more than 8,000 people in West Africa since March, with more than 4,000 people dead from the disease.

Though public service ought to be further integrated into the academic offerings at Harvard, students should not be required to take courses with a service component, administrators said Friday at a symposium hosted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Standing Committee on Public Service.
The conversation came after Cornell University announced a $150 million initiative, “Engaged Cornell,” which was launched last week and will integrate a requirement to enroll in at least one course that involves public service for all undergraduates by 2025.
“I am opposed to the idea for a required service addition to the curriculum,” said James T. Kloppenberg, a history professor and member of the FAS Standing Committee on Public Service. “However, I would very much like to see more courses offered in the undergraduate curriculum that would enable students to integrate the work they’re doing in various public service programs that they engage in with their academic work.”
Currently, there are 13 activity-based courses with a public service component at Harvard, according to Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service. Courses such as Portuguese 59: “Portuguese and the Community” and African and African American Studies 102x: “Urban Problems and the Role of the Expert” allow students to confront community issues in the Boston area.
Corbin expressed support for increased overlap between academics and service.
“What I hear most from students is they’re juggling coursework and extracurriculars, and the opportunity for there to be intersection between the two helps both their schedules and unifies their Harvard College experience,” Corbin said.
The Social Studies department will take some steps to introduce more of these classes next year, according to Kloppenberg.
He noted that other colleges allow faculty to apply for course development grants, which Harvard does not offer. Yet Corbin does not believe there is a lack of financial support for developing courses that include a public service component at Harvard, but rather a less defined platform.
“It’s not that there are no efforts [to create these courses]. It’s just that they’re fragmented and lack cohesion,” Corbin said. “So we’re coming together and determining how we want to forge this intersection at Harvard.”
One of the goals of Cornell’s initiative, according to a press release, is to “be a major reason why faculty and students choose Cornell.” Kloppenger said that many prospective students are attracted to schools with similar service components and he does not feel the same could be said about Harvard.
“Options are available through [Phillips Brooks House Association] and [the Institute of Politics] and other things, but I think we could do so much more in the curriculum, and that’s what I’d like to see happen,” he said.
Jose G. Magaña ’15, president of PBHA, agreed that there is room for improvement in Harvard’s outlook on public service, but that the current avenues for engagement also deserve recognition.
“We do hear a lot about how public service at Harvard or specifically PBHA was the reason [students] came here,” Magaña said.
Still, he added that if Harvard made more connections between public service and classroom activities, more applicants may cite the availability of those opportunities as the reason they came to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 10, 2014, at 1:15 a.m.
Top Undergraduate Council leaders have dialed up their criticism of a perceived lack of student inclusion in administrative decisions and will meet with University President Drew G. Faust Friday to demand reform.
Critical remarks came from UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 at the Council’s meeting Monday, which also featured discussion of the University’s new sexual assault policy and the Council’s handling of gender and racial equality.
“Harvard actively denies students’ input regarding decisions that affect students,” Mayopoulos said, before detailing several grievances against the University administration.
Mayopoulos first pointed to the creation of the Smith Campus Center, announced last fall. At that time, Faust outlined a goal for the center to unify the community and reinforce her vision of “one University.”
The University formed working groups to oversee its creation, but Mayopoulos said he is the only undergraduate on the common spaces working group. Mayopoulos also contended that he was specifically advised against speaking to The Crimson about the body’s deliberations, hindering his ability to communicate the campus center plans to all undergraduates.
“Believe me when I tell you it’s not going to be a student center. That’s all I feel comfortable saying right now,” he said.
Turning next to the University’s new sexual misconduct policy and procedures, Mayopoulos reiterated a concern about student inclusion in the policy’s formation.
“We were denied a single voice,” he said, emphasizing the fact that no students sat on the committee, convened in May 2013, that eventually formulated the new University policy.
Mayopoulos continued by deeming the roll-out of a recent change to the Q Guide as a “shady call” that “disregarded” the work of the Committee on Undergraduate Education.
Students’ concerns were “thrown out the window,” Mayopoulos said.
Mayopoulos summed up his examples by alleging that they represent a “consistent theme” of disregard for the student voice. He added that both he and UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 will meet with administrators in the coming weeks to advocate for changes, including the input of student voice in Harvard Corporation and Faculty Council decisions.
The UC also welcomed Alison Frank Johnson, chair of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Committee on Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures, to field questions about how FAS might best write its new policy to conform to the University-wide policy and improve programming on sexual violence prevention.
Johnson, a History professor, responded to questions about the lack of affirmative consent in the University-wide policy. Just last week, undergraduate and graduate student groups launched a petition for the inclusion of affirmative consent in the policy.
Johnson made clear she was not advising students against advocating for changes to the policy, but suggested that affirmative consent could persist as a cultural policy, even without its inclusion in the written policy.
“Culturally, affirmative consent is something we can embrace as a community, even if that phrase doesn't appear in the policy,” Johnson said.
The Council also passed two pieces of legislation designed to promote racial and gender diversity on the body. The first allocated $30o from the Student Relations Committee’s budget for the work of two new positions—the gender inclusivity liaison and the race inclusivity liaison.
The second co-sponsored a panel discussion about women in leadership with women’s groups on campus and the Institute of Politics.
UC representatives also approved another wave of grants amounting to about $7,500 and approved plans for a freshman town hall event. The event had originally been tabled last week amid discussions about scheduling.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: October 14, 2014 
An earlier version of this article stated that the committee that ultimately formulated the University's new sexual harassment policy convened in May. To clarify, the group convened in May 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In two separate social media campaigns—one organized by several Asian and Asian-American students and another spearheaded by a handful of black student groups—students posted photos to Facebook last week to show solidarity with those affected by the Oct. 3 emailed death threat.
Citing poor communication from the University and a perceived lack of support, students from both initiatives said that they sought to bring more attention to the issues of race and gender related to the threat, which was targeted primarily at Asian and Asian-American women.
“We really didn’t think of this as a campaign.... It’s really that we just wanted to say to the Asian and Asian American community that we know how you feel, and to say to the rest of the community that you need to listen,” said Sarah F. Cole ’16, president of the Black Students Association.
Black students across campus changed their Facebook profile pictures over the weekend, framing their profile pictures with an overlay captioned, “I stand in solidarity with the Asian and Asian-American Women at Harvard.”
Asian and Asian-American students also participated in a separate social media initiative last week, coordinated by Gurbani Kaur ’17. The campaign, which was first devised at an informal gathering of Asian and Asian-American students held on Oct. 4 to discuss the email threat, invited students to post photos featuring the overlay “#unapologetic,” a reference to an article published last Tuesday in Manifesta Magazine.
Students involved in last week’s photo campaigns expressed their dissatisfaction with the University’s communications with students during the threat.  Although three community advisories were disseminated by Harvard University police detailing physical safety and security procedures, students noted that no supplementary materials were disseminated by the College to offer support regarding the emotional issues related to the violent, racial, and gender-related nature of the threats.
“It was like pulling teeth just to get an email from the Dean acknowledging that this was a threat to the community—that this was something that needed to be taken seriously,” said Shengxi Li ’15, referencing an email sent last week by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acknowledging that the College “can do better” to communicate with students in the future.
Though several Asian and Asian-American students who participated in the campaign maintained that University support was underwhelming, they said they were refreshed to see that they were not alone in their demands for more sensitivity and inclusion.
“When I saw all of these photos saying ‘I stand in solidarity,’ I was pleasantly surprised,” Li said, referring to photos posted by students from the black community.
“This is really an opportunity for students to come together as a Harvard community, regardless of whatever background or whatever clubs you’re involved in,” added Li, who received one of the original threat messages. “This incident affected all of us.”

The Radcliffe women’s crew team started off its fall season with a strong showing at Saturday’s Head of the Housatonic despite the rainy conditions in Shelton, Conn. The team placed three boats in the top 10 of the varsity eight race and four in the top 10 of the varsity four race. The regatta—the Black and White’s first of its four fall season races—was the team’s first since the varsity eight finished seventh and the varsity four finished seventeenth at last spring’s NCAA Championships in Indianapolis. The Head of the Housatonic was also Radcliffe’s final tune-up before next weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta.
“All crews fought hard and raced well,” said senior Eliza Flint, who raced for Radcliffe’s second varsity eight and second varsity four. “Each boat learned something about their race, and they can use that as fuel for Head of the Charles.”
Saturday was the 20th edition of the Head of the Housatonic, annually hosted by the New Haven Rowing Club. In the varsity eight race, Radcliffe’s top boat, stroked by senior co-captain Lizzie Fitzhenry, finished with a time of 14:40, good enough for third behind Brown’s 14:25 and Yale’s 14:33. Radcliffe’s second and third boats finished ninth and tenth with times of 15:06 and 15:13, respectively.
The team also entered three other boats in the varsity eight race, with the first boat finishing 17th after posting a 15:41, the next 20th with a 16:02, and the last 27th with a 17:06.
In the varsity four race, Radcliffe’s top boat finished first with a time of 16:35, edging second place Yale by 14 seconds. The Black and White also had boats finish fourth, ninth, and tenth. Radcliffe also had boats finish 11th and 12th to give the team six in the top 12.
The weather was definitely a factor throughout the day as heavy rain led to poor visibility and high water levels.
“I think we learned what it takes to prepare for a race,” said senior co-captain Jenny Wong, who coxed the first varsity eight and first varsity four. “This weekend it was a little bit tough in terms of traveling, and there was a lot of rain. So it’s definitely [important] staying focused when there are a lot of distractions, which there certainly are during Head of the Charles.”
The regatta featured many top high school, college, and club teams from New England and New York, including 30 boats from 11 schools in the varsity eight race and 21 boats from seven schools in the varsity four race. The course at the Head of the Housatonic is 2.7 miles, slightly shorter and less problematic than the three-mile course Radcliffe will be navigating next weekend. While races in the spring are 2,000 meters, fall races are more of a marathon than a sprint.
“For the long distance racing, the idea is to have the best possible endurance as you’re sustaining a very high intensity for a long period of time, so that’s where the fitness base really comes into it,” Flint said. “There are different mentalities to it and you have a different race plan.”
The team used the race as a gauge of its fall progress, since it was the team’s first chance to compete against other collegiate programs. This was Radcliffe’s first time participating in the Head of the Housatonic since 2012 when it placed second, fifth, eighth, and tenth in the 22-boat varsity eight race and first, fifth, ninth, and tenth in the 15-boat varsity four race.
“Across the board, I think we were very strong,” Wong said. “I think it was a really great opportunity for us to get a first race experience and learn some things with Head of the Charles next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard coed sailing team finished in 11th place this weekend at the Moody Trophy hosted by the University of Rhode Island.
Senior skipper Michael Drumm and freshman crew Kevin Coakley took tenth place in the A division.
“We performed fairly well against a very competitive field of teams,” Coakley said. “[Drumm] and I made a few mistakes throughout the weekend, but we identified them and made adjustments as the racing went on.”
18 teams came out for this two-day inter-conference regatta, as racing took place in FJ boats across both divisions.
“[Drumm] and I have been specifically working on our boat-handling in practice and that paid off this weekend,” Coakley said. “We sailed fast and made some gains with that speed. Personally, I needed to improve on identifying the best breeze on the course before the rest of the fleet did.”
Junior skipper Marek Zaleski and sophomore crew Emma Wheeler finished in eighth place within the B division.
“I think this weekend went decently,” Zaleski said. “[Wheeler] and I worked well together and improved as the regatta progressed. We had a tough time getting off the starting line for most of the regatta but managed to work through our difficulties by the end.”
The weather conditions were not favorable for sailing down on Salt Pond on Saturday. Constant rain and cold air temperature made racing difficult, but the day ended up with several closely contested races. In true New England fashion, the weather turned out to be beautiful by Sunday.
“The weather was more of a factor than usual this weekend,” Coakley said. “Near-constant rain on Saturday made it difficult to see puffs on the water, and a lack of wind on Sunday forced the race committee to call off a few races.”
Roger Williams captured first place in the Moody Trophy, edging out second-place Dartmouth and third-place Yale.
"As a team, we want to continue improving throughout the season, and this weekend was no different," Coakley said. "We used this regatta as an opportunity to face off against strong competition and to identify how we can best prepare for the rest of our schedule."

Nothing screams educational innovation and massive open online courseware like dubstep.
The 2014 edition of HarvardX’s “anthem,” released just last week, already has 725 views and 19 upvotes, a sure indicator of future billboard success. The elegantly noisy dubstep track, punfully (and painfully) titled “Beauty & the Bass,” is intended to inspire students worldwide because yes, a Harvard education is yours too, for free! (Unless you want to earn a “verified” “certificate of achievement” for Cs50x. Pay up $90+ for one of those.)
The video features professorial giants like Robert A. Lue, Peter K. Bol, and Elisa New, who’s shooting hoops with Harvard’s prized men’s basketball team. When the poetry professor shoots the ball, it nervously teeters on the rim. The suspense and excitement are palpable, akin to the hype every student feels when clicking ‘play’ on a lecture video. What will happen? Will the ball make it in? Will the video load? Nothing like an online education to always keep you on edge.
And let’s not forget the tasteful black and white cuts. You can’t have an emotionally-wrought video about online learning without these subtle nods to the masterful filmmaking of Federico Fellini, because yes, those LS1a lectures will be as touching as La Dolce Vita.
This song is definitely the anthem for online education—just wait for the drop.
