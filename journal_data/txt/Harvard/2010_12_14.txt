After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust named eleven professors and administrators last Friday to serve as members of the first Harvard Library Board—an overseeing body that will name an executive director of the newly designed, centralized library structure as its first order of business.
The creation of the board is the first step in an over a year long process to centralize the University libraries to increase coordination between the formally autonomous organizations and boost accessibility to resources.
These appointments come after the Task Force on University Libraries advised the University to make these administrative changes in a Nov. 2009 report, which Provost Steven E. Hyman approved Dec. 1 after a slow decision process.
Chair of the Harvard Library Implementation Work Group David C. Lamberth, a Divinity School professor, said that this administrative change will allow for more centralized redesigning of the IT structure of the library, boosting accessibility to University resources.
The board has the immediate responsibility of naming of an executive director, who will then integrate the library resources from the schools’ discrete collections across the University, Lamberth said in a Dec. 1 interview.
Hyman will serve as chair of the board, which will include five other permanent members, including the Carl H. Pforzheimer University professor and deans or designees from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Medical School.
The other five members will rotate, serving staggered three-year terms. Two members will represent two of the six other schools in the University and the Radcliffe Institute.
The other three members will be at-large faculty members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little heart goes a long way.
That's what Harvard men’s basketball recruit Steve Moundou-Missi found out after his performance at the Hoops with a Heart Classic earned him recognition by ESPN. ESPN Recruiting's Marty Richter named Missi, a senior at Montverde Academy, a "player to watch" and offered the following description:
"Moundou-Missi is a strong bodied, post player with good athleticism who plays with a tremendous amount of energy on both ends of the floor. Moundou-Missi was able to score 18 points down low with drop-step moves to his left shoulder, step through in the post over his left shoulder, spins to finish, rebound put-backs and filling the lane in transition with dunks. Moundou-Missi has good hands and can catch tough passes in traffic. The Harvard commit also rebounds the ball at the highest point, even outside of his area."
Last year, Moundou-Missi's Montverde Eagles went 23-5 and made it to the finals of the National High School Invitational. The only returning starter, Moundou-Missi and teammate Patricio Garino, a former member of Argentina's junior national team, have led Montverde to a 6-1 record as of Dec. 11. The 210-lb. power forward verbally committed to Harvard on Oct. 25 after deciding between the Crimson, Brown, Iowa, and Princeton.
The Hoops with a Heart Classic is played in memory of Rob Graham, a former coach who died following cardiac arrest suffered during a competition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only four teams were in action last weekend as ECAC women’s hockey wrapped up play before the holidays. No team will hit the ice again until Dec. 29, so here at The Back Page, we took this opportunity to look back on the first half of the 2010-11 season. One team is on the fast track to the conference crown, and two seem to be already out of the playoff chase, but everything else is still up for grabs in this week’s edition of power rankings.
 
1. Cornell (13-1-0, 8-0-0 ECAC, 1st in conference)
Cornell has had one of the most dominant first halves in ECAC history, holding onto a slim lead over Wisconsin in the national polls despite its bye week. The Big Red’s only loss came at the hands of No. 4 Mercyhurst, and it’s won all but one of its conference games by at least two goals. Cornell only has five games left at home, but with its nonconference schedule behind it, look for the Big Red to cruise through the conference and earn home ice in the NCAA tournament.
2. St. Lawrence (9-8-2, 4-3-0, 7th)
St. Lawrence upset then-No. 3 Mercyhurst on Friday night with a dominating 6-2 win, proving that the program is well on its way to returning to its former powerhouse status. Though the Lakers brought the Saints back to earth with a 7-3 win in the second game of the series, St. Lawrence is poised to make a run for home ice in the conference playoffs—particularly since it has four more conference games left on its schedule than Quinnipiac and Princeton.
3. Quinnipiac (13-6-1, 6-5-0, 2nd)
Quinnipiac’s been on a roll lately, and though it already has its toughest ECAC tests behind it—the Bobcats have dropped two games to Cornell—road trips to Dartmouth, Harvard, and St. Lawrence still loom. Look for Jan. 7’s matchup between Quinnipiac and the Saints to be a big momentum boost for whichever team emerges victorious.
4. Harvard (5-6-2, 4-2-2, t-3rd)
Harvard did something it hasn’t done since 2003 on Thursday night—it beat New Hampshire (and at the massive Whittemore Center, no less). And then on Friday, it did something it’s never done before—it lost to BU for the first time since the Terriers became a varsity program. The Crimson’s endured one of the toughest schedules in the country in the last month, playing six out of its last seven games against ranked teams, so look for the Harvard women to string some wins together against weaker conference opponents in January.
5. Princeton (6-10-1, 4-6-1, t-5th)
After sweeping Syracuse in a weekend set, Princeton heads into the holiday break riding a three-game winning streak. A date with No. 6 Boston College on New Year’s Eve could put a stop to that momentum, and the Tigers draw Quinnipiac, St. Lawrence, and Harvard in four of their first six conference games of 2011.
6. Dartmouth (6-5-0, 5-3-0, t-3rd)
Dartmouth—a team that was ranked No. 9 in the country less than a month ago—is reeling after four straight losses, including being shut out by a lowly New Hampshire team. The Big Green opens play in 2011 against a comparable Connecticut team.
7. Rensselaer (6-7-6, 4-3-1, t-5th)
Rensselaer finishes the first half of the season with a few signature wins (over No. 8 Providence, Quinnipiac, and St. Lawrence) and a couple of glaring missteps (a loss to Brown, a tie with Union). Things don’t get easier in January: the Engineers’ next four weekends of play come against Cornell, Colgate, Harvard, and Dartmouth.
8. Yale (4-8-2, 3-4-1, t-8th)
Yale’s on the verge of breaking into the middle tier of the ECAC for good, but it draws a pair of top-10 teams—Boston College and Cornell—in the first week of 2011. Luckily, the Bulldogs have a Jan. 12 matchup with Brown to look forward to.
9. Clarkson (6-10-3, 3-3-1, t-8th)
After graduating three of its top five scorers from a team that made it to the ECAC championship game last season, Clarkson has struggled in the first half of the 2010-11 campaign. Senior goaltender Lauren Dahm’s goals-against average is a full point higher than last year, and the potent Quinnipiac offense will provide yet another test on Jan. 8.
10. Colgate (6-12-0, 3-5-0, 10th)
Colgate’s looking...well, mediocre. It’s got no major upsets, no particularly glaring miscues, and no standout players. The Raiders get to warm up against four relatively easy opponents before going head-to-head with Cornell in a home-and-home series the weekend of Jan. 21.
11. Union (1-14-3, 0-6-2, 12th)
Union’s the team you really want to root for, but the Dutchwomen still haven’t quite found a way to break through. The squad played Connecticut and Maine close last week, coming away with a tie and a pair of one-goal losses, and it gets to start 2011 with six straight home games.
12. Brown (2-8-2, 1-5-2, 11th)
In the first 15 days of 2011, Brown will have to play against the No. 1, No. 3, and No. 4 teams in the country, facing off twice with Mercyhurst. That’s just unfortunate scheduling for a team that hasn’t won a game since Nov. 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, The Full-Court Press takes you to Blodgett pool where, after racing against some of the top five schools in the nation earlier this month at the Georgia Invitational, the women’s swim team is back in training mode preparing for the spring season. Leading the charge are seven seniors, including Eliot resident Katherine Pickard. If there’s one thing to know about the senior from Phoenix, it’s that she absolutely loves Frosted Flakes, or as her teammates say, “you don’t get between Pickard and her flakes.” In this exclusive interview, Katherine talks about flakes, Shamu, and most importantly, beating Princeton. Every week The Full-Court Press gives you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Katherine Pickard
Year: 2011
Stats: In Pickard’s first collegiate race at Harvard, she won in the 500-yard freestyle against Cornell. Since then, she’s racked up 11 top-three finishes at the annual Ivy Championships, provisionally qualified for NCAAs every year, and now holds four school records.
Onward and upward! 
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Frosted Flakes, the breakfast of champions.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
It changes from meet to meet but “Infiniti” by Guru Josh Project, “Yeah 3x” by Chris Brown, “Dangerous” by the Ying Yang Twins, “Sexy Bitch” by David Guetta.
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
Princeton so we can jump in their pool and celebrate when we win.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Spontaneous dance party to “I’m On a Boat” while also eating pizza.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had in the pool.
Dropped my pants in the locker room in front of my male assistant coach (on accident).
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I would say Shamu because my tricks look pretty but I have a vicious bite.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a meet you were swimming in.
“Get ‘er done.”
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I’m not much of an athlete out of the water, but definitely tennis so I could wear the cute outfits.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
I’m terrified of heights so I wouldn’t play.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
 
I would have a picnic with Nathan Adrian on the beach.

While you may have been enjoying our tips on procrastination, reading period is officially over and it’s time to start working.
Can’t pry your eyes from Facebook? Unable to stop sparking possible love interests? Addicted to HarvardFML? With impending three-hour exams and take-home finals fast approaching, we have compiled a list of the best sites that can help you keep focused.
LeechBlock: LeechBlock is an add-on for the Firefox browser. It allows you to choose sites that have been distracting, set how long you want to keep yourself from visiting those sites, and presto—no more distractions.
StayFocused:  StayFocused is similar in concept to LeechBlock, but instead of outright blocking the sites you wish to avoid, StayFocused limits the amount of time per day you can spend on them. Conveniently, StayFocused is a free install for the Google Chrome browser.
Freedom: The Internet is full of distractions and it might seem impossible to block them all, but Freedom does just that. Users can turn off access to the Internet for up to eight hours at a time. While the site is powerful, unfortunately it is not free—you’ll need to pay $10 through PayPal or Google Checkout for this ultimate fix.
BSC: Finally, if the above tricks aren’t working, you may want to consider the self-help resources available through the Bureau of Study Council, where you can find information and strategies on how to manage time more efficiently.
So there you have it. Now there’s no excuse to be distracted this week while studying for your finals!

Hopefully you're not expecting any checks to arrive in your campus mailbox after next week.
According to the Harvard University Operations Services website, the Student Mail Forwarding Center will not be forwarding mail during winter break or J-Term (Dec. 22, 2010 - Jan. 23, 2011). Orders for the spring semester, however, are still being processed.
Students are instructed to contact hsmfc@harvard.edu with any questions.
