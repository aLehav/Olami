After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“#bombharvard and end their pro-black agenda,” Arizona resident Nicholas Zuckerman allegedly wrote in the comments section of a Harvard Instagram post of the University's 2017 black Commencement, the first of its kind. He allegedly continued: “If the blacks only ceremony happens, then I encourage violence and death at it [...] I’m thinking two automatics with extendo clips.” According to the U.S. attorney’s office, he then spammed other accounts referencing the black Commencement repeatedly with the hashtag “#bombharvard.”
Thankfully, Zuckerman is now facing federal charges for his threats. However—though he was the most violently vocal—he wasn’t alone in his thoughts.
Writer Charlie Kirk called the black Commencement “racist and a disgrace to all racial progress made over the last 60 yrs [sic].” Comedian David Smalley said he believed “the lines between ‘celebration’ and ‘segregation’ are getting blurry." Many others questioned the need for these ceremonies, even manifesting Martin Luther King Jr.’s alleged disappointment in arguments against holding these events.
All of this is not only frightening, but is completely and utterly baffling to me.
Cultural graduation ceremonies, such as the black, Latinx, BGLTQ, and first-gen Commencements held here at Harvard, are not unique to this campus. Universities across the country have been celebrating the graduation of certain underrepresented groups in their communities for decades. University of California, Riverside, for example, just held its 45th annual “Raza Grad” for Latinx Students. Virginia Tech hosts 10 different ceremonies for people of Jewish, American Indian and Indigenous, Asian American, African American, Latinx, Muslim, International, BGLTQ (or ‘Lavender’), Veteran, and substance abuse recovering communities. Yale, Stanford, and Columbia also have similar graduation events for underrepresented groups.
These cultural ceremonies are commonly hosted in addition to University Commencement proceedings and offer nothing more to the collegiate experience than a mere celebration of self at its closing. They are held to recognize the struggles of these particular groups and to honor the history and customs associated with each group, such as the donning of the kente cloth or partly conducting the celebration in Spanish. The University usually does not have any administrative involvement in these ceremonies. Typically, they are organized and led by students in prideful acknowledgement of the achievements individuals in their communities have made—especially given the fact that many of these communities were initially exploited in or excluded from this institution.
Arguments against these cultural graduation ceremonies and the outcry against their purported self-segregationist and racist natures are misguided and dangerous. While many social spaces on this campus are exclusionary, these Commencement ceremonies are not. They are open to all who identify with or choose to support the students being celebrated in these communities. Families, friends, and allies of black, Latinx, BGLTQ, first-gen, or other groups who have Commencement ceremonies are invited with open arms to these events. Even evoking segregationist rhetoric towards these welcoming, celebratory events undercuts the severity of the decades at Harvard where white and black students were actually segregated and weren’t allowed to sleep in the same building.
Calling these events racist or saying that they are regressive in the face of societal progress is laughable. When we have a government that dehumanizes the Latinx community, a country that’s tearing itself apart over police brutality against black and brown bodies, and an institution that still needs affirmative action to give all students an equal opportunity to even be admitted, one cannot claim that we have finally reached sufficient racial progress (whatever that is) “over the last 60 yrs [sic]” to now stop recognizing the history and culture of marginalized groups here on campus—or anywhere for that matter.
Progress is not couched in blindness. Wishing that underrepresented minorities and marginalized groups would stop getting together to speak other languages or give each other representative stoles during Commencement week is not progress. Ignoring the specific challenges and successes of certain races or ethnicities on campus by doing away with these ceremonies is not progress. Progress is being able to recognize the need for these kinds of events and acknowledging that an additional celebration of student achievements through these ceremonies does nothing to take away from the success of the Harvard community at large. Rather, these additional ceremonies are an example of the diversity, resilience, and growth at the end of its student’s academic and personal journeys here.
So when it’s my time to walk across the first-gen, Latinx, and University Commencement stage, I hope #bombharvard is a thing of the past. I’ll be proud to attend each graduation ceremony because I will be welcomed, and because I will belong.

Athletes with the highest or second-highest academic rating on an internal Harvard admissions scale have an acceptance rate of 83 percent—compared to 16 percent for non-athletes—according to a report from the University’s Office of Internal Research.
The report, initially meant to remain internal, was referenced by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in documents filed in court June 15.
SFFA is currently suing Harvard over alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process. The University has repeatedly denied these claims.
Both the University and SFFA submitted expert analyses of admissions data on June 15, but the group’s respective methodologies differ on the treatment of athletes
SFFA hired Duke University professor Peter S. Arcidiacono and senior fellow at The Century Foundation Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85 to author two separate studies based on data released to the group. In turn, Harvard hired University of California, Berkeley professor David E. Card to analyze the SFFA findings and conduct an alternative study.
While Card considered athletes in his analysis, Arcidiacono excluded athletes because of the different standard by which they are evaluated in comparison to non-athletes, according to SFFA’s filings.
By Ivy League Conference rules, recruited athletes are placed on a 240-point Academic Index, which is calculated based on GPA and standardized test scores. While the minimum score required for Ivy League admissions is 176, the average Academic Index for recruited athletes cannot be more than one standard deviation below the index of the previous four freshmen classes.
At Harvard, the student body index is roughly 220—approximately equivalent to a SAT score of 2200 and near 4.0 GPA, according to a 2014 Crimson report. Students who walk-on to teams are not included in the Athletic Department’s estimate.
Coaches cannot guarantee admissions spots to prospective student-athletes, whose applications must be vetted by the full 40-member admissions committee. Recruited athletes who pass this process will receive a ‘likely letter,’ indicating the applicant is likely to be admitted by the University.
Arcidiacono noted that athletes with an academic rating of 1 or 2 on Harvard’s scale of 1 to 6—with 1 being the highest and 6 the lowest—had a markedly higher admit rate than non-athletes with the same academic scores. For example, Arcidiacono noted that recruited athletes with an academic rating of 4 had an acceptance rate of 70.46 percent, nearly a thousand times greater than the 0.076 percent admit rate for non-athletes with the same academic rating.
He wrote in his analysis that he removed athletes from his statistical analyses to allow “comparison of similarly situated candidates” and to create “better analysis of the role that racial preferences are playing in the admissions process.”
“The expanded dataset includes all domestic first-year applicants with complete applications and data except for recruited athletes,” a SFFA’s filing reads. “Arcidiacono excludes athletes from the expanded dataset because their extraordinary admission rate demonstrates that the admissions process for this group is very different.”
In contrast, Card included recruited athletes in his study.  In the University’s filings, Card argued that because all applicants go through the admissions committee, recruited athletes should not be excluded from statistical analyses.
“First, as a general matter, Harvard compares all of its applicants in each year to all other applicants in the pool for that year; it does not conduct separate admissions processes for discrete subsets of the pool,” Card wrote. “The fact that some candidates with particular attributes (such as lineage applicants or recruited athletes) have a higher likelihood of admission does not mean that they should be completely excluded from the analysis.”
College admissions consultant Zaragoza A. Guerra said that while participation in athletics can demonstrate valued soft skills— such as the ability to work in a team— involvement in athletics alone does not give applicants a clear advantage because colleges consider far many more factors, such as other extracurricular involvements.
Because of the multi-faceted approach to reviewing candidates, SFFA’s omission of recruited athletes in their dataset may prove “inconclusive,” Guerra added.
“If athletics was one of the several factors that Harvard considered, then why remove those students from your dataset?” Guerra, who was an admissions officer at MIT and the Boston Conservatory, said. “I think all students should be considered. All students have identities, such as racial and ethnic backgrounds that go beyond whether they are legacy students, whether they are recruited athletes, academics, or musicians.”
While the court could forgo a trial by deciding all or parts of the case with a summary judgement, a trial is scheduled for Oct. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College students will be required to complete a Title IX training module to enroll in fall 2018 classes, Title IX administrators wrote in an email to students Thursday.
The training module, currently in its third iteration, will focus on the school’s “policy and resources,” according to the email sent by Emily Miller and Brian Libby, Title IX coordinators for the College. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex or gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment. The College has offered versions of the training in recent years, but until this coming year, students have faced no consequences for failing to complete them.
Miller and Libby wrote that they met with student focus groups over the past year to get feedback on the trainings.
“Many of you have spoken up and asked that we do more to ensure that every single student completes this training,” they wrote. “We heard you.”
This module and requirement are specific to the College’s Title IX training, though the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has its own separate training program. GSAS students are required to complete their Title IX training as part of their registration process.
In May, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie Lapp wrote to faculty and staff to inform them that they would now be required to complete their own Title IX training. That announcement came in the wake of allegations that Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez had sexually harassed women in the department for decades.
Over the past two years, the University has worked to implement recommendations from a 2016 University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention, which called for trainings for students, faculty, and staff across Harvard’s schools.
The task force specifically recommended that Harvard’s schools require all of their students complete annual online modules. But roll-out of these modules has been uneven across schools. The College introduced the first online module for students in 2016, and offered two versions during the 2017-2018 academic year—one for incoming students and one for returning students. Many graduate and professional schools have since developed similar modules for students, though not all are mandatory.
This year’s mandatory training will become available in early August, Miller and Libby’s email said. Students who wish to opt out may do so on an individual basis, and will instead complete the training in person, either individually or in a group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Court filings detailing previously unknown aspects of Harvard’s secretive admissions process will likely do little to damage the University’s image, public relations experts say.
Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group suing the University over alleged bias against Asian-American applicants, both filed several hundred pages of documents earlier this month as part of the lawsuit. The documents reveal Harvard assigns numerical ratings to College hopefuls in a variety of categories—and that, while Asian-American applicants tend to garner higher academic and extracurricular scores than their peers, their personal ratings lag behind those of other racial groups.
This new knowledge has prompted a slew of anti-Harvard opinion pieces, with some authors claiming the University harbors anti-Asian American prejudice, and still others criticizing different details, like the University’s preference for legacies, that have come to light in the documents.
But public relations experts say these critical opinion pieces do not mean Harvard has lost the public relations battle.
“In general, it will take quite a bit to damage the ‘Harvard brand,’” said Maggy Ralbovsky, executive vice president and managing director of Dick Jones, a firm that specializes in education public relations, calling Harvard’s brand the “gold standard.”
Michael Fineman, president of Fineman PR, agreed.
“The Harvard brand is strong and widely trusted,” he wrote in an email. “The admissions debate is, I believe, more a matter for the courts than the targeted stakeholders who represent more of an elite audience.”
Another factor in Harvard’s favor, according to Ralbovsky, is that the University has a “track record” of caring about its students that could outweigh the negative press the University attracts from the case. History, she said, is on Harvard’s side.
And, even if the University attracts some negative press from the admissions lawsuit, there can be more important factors at play, according to the experts.
Sometimes, even if a group takes a small public relations hit, it is still in its best interests to divulge information that could bolster its chances of a legal victory, Karen Schwartzman, founder of the Boston-based P.R. firm Polaris, said.
“Sometimes the reputation issue get caught up in the legal defense,” she said. “In order to put forth the legal defense, sometimes an organization does by necessity damage to its reputation because it must divulge to the court information that makes the strongest case.”
Still, despite experts’ optimism that Harvard will overcome the public relations headache, Ralbovsky said it may be too soon to determine definitively how the lawsuit will affect the University’s image.
“Time will tell how it plays out,” she said.
