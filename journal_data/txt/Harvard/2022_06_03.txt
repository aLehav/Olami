Content warning: suicide. This review contains spoilers.
Most nights, 13-year-old Léo sleeps over at his best friend Remi’s house. After a long day spent playing in the summer sun, living in the imaginary worlds that young boys create, they lie side by side in Remi’s bed. Léo makes up a story to help lull Remi to sleep, and soon they are both drifting off. The next day will be a lot like this one. The boys’ last few days of summer are spent in the easy camaraderie of their lifelong friendship. As Léo himself says, they’re so close they’re practically brothers.
Belgian director Lukas Dhont’s latest feature “Close,” which premiered at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 26, begins by showcasing the intimate bond between the inseparable Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Remi (Gustav De Waele). When they start a new school year, however, the narrative shifts to portray the fragmentation of their relationship as external perceptions of their friendship prompt Léo to pull away from Remi. “Close” continues to unravel into a complicated portrait of friendship and grief, illustrating with devastating poignancy how love and loss are inextricably linked.
The film immediately pulls viewers into the carefree world of Léo and Remi. Both young actors are incredibly emotive, and audiences easily fall in love with their sweet, boyish dispositions. The camera tracks them as they tirelessly race through the colorful flowering gardens of Léo’s parents’ farm. They are intimately framed falling asleep beside each other at night as they exchange jokes and dreams and fantasies. As Remi practices his oboe solo, Léo proclaims he will become an oboe celebrity and he’ll join him on a world tour as his manager. The easiness of their friendship — their tenderness, their familiarity — is beautifully rendered.
Léo is affectionate with Remi until school starts, and other kids start commenting on how close they are. Two prying girls ask if they’re a couple; Léo rebuffs this, saying they’re just best friends, and why should their relationship be perceived any differently from a female best friendship? Whether or not they actually harbor feelings for each other remains unanswered; either way, Léo and Remi share some sort of soulmate-level bond. The teasing starts to bother Léo, though, and he pushes Remi away. He joins an ice hockey team and makes it clear he doesn’t want Remi to join; when Remi lies his head on him at recess, he rolls away from him. To see their friendship fractured in this way is heartbreaking, and De Waele embodies Remi’s hurt feelings with a well of emotions behind his eyes.
It is impossible to talk about “Close” without revealing its shocking, heart wrenching narrative turn midway through the film. One day, while coming home from a field trip on which Remi was distinctly absent, Léo and his classmates learn that Remi has died by suicide. Alongside Léo, the audience is absolutely gutted. At a press screening on May 26, audible crying could be heard across the Debussy Theater. After getting to know Remi — his musical talent, his playfulness, his sensitivity, his loving nature — it is devastating to lose such an endearing character in such a tragic way.
Some may accuse “Close” of bordering on trauma porn with the dark turn it takes, especially after Dhont’s first feature film “Girl” was criticized for exploiting its young queer protagonist with gratuitous depictions of suffering. However, Remi’s death is not purely for the sake of shock value or eliciting tears from the audience: The latter half of “Close” becomes a genuinely moving, if painful, examination of grief.
Léo is racked with sadness and guilt, exacerbated by the fact that Remi had fought with him about the distance between them before his death. In their emotional turmoil, Léo and Remi’s mother Sophie (Émilie Dequenne) find themselves drawn to each other, looking for absolution and answers. Their mourning is understated but palpable, and Dhont observes them with careful, subtle direction. There are long silences and penetrable gazes; their heartbreak lies in the quietest of moments, in the things left unsaid. Benign conversations — ”How’s school?,” “How’s work”? — thinly veil their profound sadness. Underneath Léo’s façade of normalcy, underneath his guilt, there is the simple fact of his unrelenting grief: “Il me manque,” he tells his older brother one night, facing away from him. “I miss him.”
Even as it delves into tragedy, “Close” remains aesthetically beautiful. In a moment of respite, Léo plays with his brother in the tall, flowering fields of their Belgian farm; they ride home together in silent companionship in the back of a truck. There are many gorgeous, poignant moments like this, shot with a quiet reserve, that might bring tears to viewers’ eyes. With such delicate, contemplative scenes, the audience is allowed the space to process all the difficult emotions of “Close” alongside its protagonists.
Although his second feature explores difficult topics, Dhont ultimately manages to handle them with care. “Close” is about grappling with masculinity, and perhaps more ambiguously about sexuality. It is also about the power of intimate relationships, and the enormous grief felt if one loses such a relationship. There are no concrete answers offered to explain the tragedy at the center of this film, and that is reflective of real life. “Close” is the kind of story that leaves a deep imprint on its audience — one looks back on it with an aching tenderness, but the pain is worth it.

Directors Riley Keough and Gina Gammell made their Cannes debut with the May 21 premiere of “War Pony,” an immersive slice-of-life feature set on South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Reservation that stands apart for its grounded subtlety amidst the grandiose melodrama of the festival lineup. Produced in collaboration with Lakota co-writers Franklin Sioux Bob and Bill Reddy and Indigenous producer Willi White, the film was inspired by Sioux Bob and Reddy’s experiences on the reservation. It follows two young men struggling to get by amidst the pressures of poverty, family turmoil and unsympathetic authority figures. The affecting drama is a triumph of communal filmmaking that highlights the perspectives of Native creatives, offering a fluid coming-of-age story that resists the narrative urge to insert artificial endings or draw conclusions from the nuanced realities of its environment.
Bill (Jojo Bapteist Whiting), a scrappy 23-year-old father of two, lives in uneasy limbo, bringing in sporadic income on odd jobs as he stays with his mother and tries to convince his unimpressed ex Echo (Jesse Schmockel) to take him back. His life is shaped by the ties tethering him to his community, from his responsibility to his two young children and their mothers to the money-making schemes he dreams up with his friends and his often antagonistic relationship with his own mother. Conversely, the film’s other lead Matho (LaDainian Crazy Thunder) is burdened by isolation, forced from childhood to navigate a harsh world without a consistent support network. After an argument with his father and a sudden tragedy leave Matho out on the street, he must find a way to take care of himself. As his opportunities for stability dwindle, he takes increasingly dangerous risks in an effort to maintain the brash, thrill-seeking identity he’s constructed among his friends. Rather than presenting a straightforward plot with a simple beginning, middle, and end, “War Pony” unfolds into an atmospheric, aching portrait of Bill and Matho’s lives, tracing their joys and heartbreaks with an intimate observational style.
The film’s naturalistic study of its well-drawn, charismatic characters creates an engrossing pace and affecting stakes even as the film transcends the structure of a plot-driven feature. That’s not to say that “War Pony” doesn’t have stirring highs and lows: it injects urgency, humor, and heart with imaginative storylines including Bill’s plan to make money by breeding poodles, his unlikely employment as an assistant to a sleazy white ranch owner, and Matho’s experience living with a relative who takes in child orphans and has them earn their keep by helping her package drugs. In each of these moments, all of the characters appear as three-dimensional people burdened by complex obligations and desires, a testament to the empathetic attentiveness of the filmmaking.
Throughout its runtime, the film imaginatively portrays its characters’ constant challenges not as a cheap ploy to ratchet up suspense or reduce their lives to grim vignettes, but instead to create an environment of continuous pressure amidst victories and pitfalls. “War Pony”’s continual portrayal of triumph and adversity demonstrates how forces of love, legacy and necessity shape the lives of its protagonists. As Sioux Bob told Deadline, “I just wanted everything I lived through in daily life, living on the reservation, to be portrayed through the film… in a lot of Native films it’s either the poverty porn or it’s about one topic.”
The film’s moving, authentic tone reflects its unusual origin story; the idea for the film was born seven years ago, after Keough struck up a friendship with first-time actors Sioux Bob and Reddy on the set of Andrea Arnold’s similarly hypnotic 2016 film “American Honey” when it was shooting in Pine Ridge. Keough introduced Reddy to her best friend Gammell and they hit it off, leading the pair to visit Reddy and Sioux Bob in Pine Ridge over the following years and experiment on a series of collaborative music videos and short films. Keough and Gammell spent a few years getting to know the Pine Ridge community with no plans for a feature film, but the death of Reddy’s pitbull Beast inspired the four friends to start making a film as tribute to the dog. The loss sparked a writing process that saw Sioux Bob and Reddy weave stories from their own and their friends’ lives into a portrait of two young men and a window into their lives on the reservation.
First-time actors Whiting and Crazy Thunder deliver emotive, shattering performances as the charming, inconsistent Bill and the overburdened, resourceful Matho. The realism of their acting is bolstered by an all-around excellent supporting cast and an engrossing script, which stands apart from other coming-of-age films at the festival with sharp dialogue, a slow build, and a moving last act that connects its divergent storylines without imposing a reductive conclusion.
Ultimately, “War Pony” is a striking, evocative, and beautiful story of youth and survival on the Pine Ridge Reservation. More broadly, it speaks to the urgency of making space and funding for Indigenous filmmakers and creatives to tell their own stories. The film took home the Camera d’Or, the jury-selected award for the best directorial debut in any Cannes selection category, but the festival and the broader film community still have a long way to go to support Indigenous  filmmakers and recognize their work.

Arnaud Desplechin’s latest film “Frère et Sœur” (“Brother and Sister”) begins by thrusting viewers right in the middle of a hostile, tragic confrontation: An anxious-looking man named André (Francis Leplay) visits the home of his former best friend Louis (Melvil Poupaud) to offer him condolences following the death of his six-year-old son. However, Louis is absolutely furious to see him. He orders him out of the house, where right outside the door, André’s wife Alice (Marion Cotillard) — who is also Louis’s estranged older sister — is quietly waiting outside. She didn’t have the nerve, or perhaps the inclination, to face her brother after the death of the nephew she never met.
“Frère et Sœur,” which premiered on May 20 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, maintains approximately this level of melodrama for the entirety of its runtime. Fast forward five years after the opening scene, and yet another family tragedy has forced the estranged Alice and Louis to face one another. What ensues is an emotionally rich, though vaguely sketched, depiction of their intense sibling rivalry. While “Frère et Sœur” lacks enough exposition for viewers to truly believe in Alice and Louis’s exaggerated hatred for each other, Cotillard and Poupaud offer dynamic performances to ground the story in a sense of realism.
When their parents get into a life-threatening car accident, Alice, a stage actress, and Louis, a poet, must return to their hometown to look after them in the hospital. The only problem: they refuse to be in the same room together, and will do literally anything to avoid interacting with one another. Their sweet younger brother Fidèle (Benjamin Siksou), however, is entirely neutral and has no issue with either sibling. Louis, who moved to an isolated rural area with his wife after their son died (they are accessible only by horseback), was hesitant to even visit his parents because it would mean being near his sister. Naturally, viewers are itching to know what could possibly have been the impetus for such deep-seated mutual contempt. Unfortunately, a clear and understandable explanation is never really offered — presumably intentional on Desplechin’s part, but nevertheless frustrating.
“Frère et Sœurr” is rife with many over-the-top moments of tension between the two siblings. Alice is a successful actress, so melodrama is perhaps in her nature. When she accidentally ends up in the same place at the same time as Louis — the hallway of the hospital — she dramatically collapses to the ground, a moment that is captivating yet just shy of amusing. When they both must attend a consultation regarding their parents, a separate entrance is arranged for Louis to go through. Family members and strangers alike are caught in the elaborate song-and-dance to keep them apart. Eventually, an opaque and hazy flashback offers some context on their rivalry, but viewers are still left with a myriad of questions.
Despite the lack of explanation for their mutual resentment, Cotillard and Poupaud uplift the film with sincere performances that effectively convey the depth of their anger. They succeed in creating a palpable sense of hostility between the two obstinate characters with cutting line delivery and chilling glares. Moreover, both of them are caught in intense downward emotional spirals. They barely contain their sadness and rely on substance abuse. They often lash out in emotional outbursts to innocent people in powerfully tense scenes. The depiction of their parallel mental health struggles adds a poignant layer to the narrative, showing how their experiences overlap even as they maintain that they hate each other.
Although the majority of the film is grounded in realism, “Frère et Sœur” also succeeds in its most imaginative moments. In one scene, Louis reads aloud a letter he is writing to his sister. Facing the camera and audience head on, it’s as if he can express his inner world to viewers more easily than he can to his family. In another fascinating sequence, Louis takes opium then flies effortlessly through the night sky until he finds himself hovering outside his mother’s hospital room window. The audience is transported alongside him, caught in this sudden wave of magical realism. With his ambiguous approach to Alice and Louis’s feud, Desplechin could have leaned even further into the fantastical, allowing audiences to learn more about them through unexpected creative moments like these.
There is ultimately an intriguing emotional arc to Alice and Louis’s relationship as they slowly spend more time together. And while viewers might not understand everything about them and their unique dynamic, they still come to care for the duo, with all their layers and nuances.

In his five decades of filmmaking, David P. Cronenberg has often probed the appeal and significance of body modification in subversive, thrilling ways. In “Dead Ringers” (1988), a pair of sinister twins perform gynecological surgeries like twisted rituals. “eXistenZ” (1999) shows everyday people getting their kicks from biosynthetic VR games, logging on via cable ports in their abdomens. In the subtler “Eastern Promises” (2007), a Russian hitman traces his violent path through gangland with intricate tattoos. With these films and his others, Cronenberg’s storytelling is suffused with a powerful reverence for the body and the importance (or burden) it poses in his characters’ lives. On the cinematic screen, where audiences can experience only the visual echoes of pain, Cronenberg orchestrates grotesque injuries and shocking transformations in the service of art, conveying profoundly human messages.
Cronenberg has this in common with the protagonist of his latest film, the 2022 Cannes Film Festival premiere "Crimes of the Future," who does that literally: Artist Saul Tenser (Viggo Mortensen) performs surgeries on himself in front of audiences with the help of his partner Caprice (Léa Seydoux). Saul experiences his own operations with the removed curiosity of a movie-theater audience, without discomfort; in the futuristic dystopia where the film is set, humans no longer feel pain. It’s just one of the effects of Accelerated Evolutionary Syndrome, a widespread condition that causes the human body to transform from the inside out, sparking spontaneous organ growth, changing diets, and in some cases (as viewers soon see) attempts to engineer evolution towards new semi-synthetic forms.
As the film progresses, Saul encounters a range of shadowy figures attempting to capitalize on (or rein in) this new stage of evolution, including secretive government bureaucrats Wippet (Don McKellar) and Timlin (Kristen Stewart) and biosynthetics-obsessed cult leader Lang Dotrice (Scott Speedman). As the story kicks off, it has every element it needs to build the kind of skin-crawling, mind-bending speculative drama that Cronenberg has pioneered.
Disappointingly, though, “Crimes of the Future” never builds much of anything: not meaning; not character dimensionality; and certainly not the tense, imaginative atmosphere that makes Cronenberg’s earlier horror so engrossing. Saul appears as a caricature of a tortured artist, doing his superficially interesting surgery performances as his body breaks down. The film presents his art form without much commentary, and it feels like an under-explored gag (man cuts himself open for spectators!) rather than a rich thematic center for the film. The cast of eclectic background characters are similarly unidimensional, from Saul’s lazily-drawn devotee Caprice to the entertaining but over-done admirer Timlin. These characters could be engaging supports if the film’s central plotline was more well-defined, interesting, or urgent. But instead, the movie drags and jumps between characters, unwilling to commit to its identity as either a thriller or a meditative portrait of a dystopia. It doesn’t transcend either genre — it just has some of the strengths and all of the problems of both, lacking character complexity and narrative momentum as it attempts to showcase a shoddily-drawn dystopian world.
Don’t take these criticisms as skepticism around body horror’s power, or Cronenberg’s ability to brilliantly bridge genres. On the contrary, his earlier films electrify with their deft defiance of genre conventions as he achieves dramatic depth, stunning romance, horror-movie subversion, and twisty thrills all at once. But the potency of his prior experiments set a high bar for his return to horror, and “Crimes of the Future” feels like a pale imitation.
Though Cronenberg re-teams with longtime production designer Carol Spier for the film, the sets feel cheap and falsely theatrical in comparison to the visual worlds of his prior films, including the plastic-looking biosynthetic pod Saul sleeps in. Flesh meets metal in a few creepy, classically Cronenbergian design touches, including the biosynthetic ports used throughout the film, the skeletal chair device Saul uses to eat, and the gelatinous operating technology he uses — but all of these feel distractingly familiar after “eXistenZ.” The film’s most interesting futuristic devices, namely the machines made of yellowed bone and grotesque ports for synthetic flesh, already appeared in that film twenty five years ago. And when Caprice licks Tenser’s abdominal wound in what is supposed to be a shocking gesture, it’s a weirdly direct re-enactment of Allegra’s psychosexual makeout with Ted’s bioport in the prior film.
If the vision of dystopia in “Crimes” was more interesting, immersive, or populated by fresher creative technologies than it is, these similarities would be a nice tribute — but in the absence of a new, equally engaging cinematic world to get lost in, they just seem played out. The film’s thematic shallowness makes its lackluster atmosphere even more striking.
As a whole, the movie poses some interesting questions about how medical technology, social norms, and the dissolving boundary between public and private life can combine to make body modification a lucrative form of entertainment. But by the end, viewers are left wondering what exactly the movie is trying to say about humanity or the body, beyond the idea that people are fascinated by its deconstruction and will seek out more intense transformation as our technology and environment change. These ideas were already evident in Cronenberg’s past work, and his career itself — after all, thousands of people crowded into the “Crimes” premiere at Cannes to catch a first glimpse of eyelids sewn shut and torsos sliced open by the master of body horror. But as it turns out, this latest surgical spectacle tells us little about our world, now or in the future. Viewers would be better off just rewatching “eXistenZ.”

Six years after his lyrical, bloody Victorian romance “The Handmaiden” rocked the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, South Korean director and writer Park Chan-wook has returned to the festival in full force with the May 23 premiere of “Decision to Leave,” an absorbing and powerful meditation on infatuation, obsession, and self-destruction. As he weaves together the atmospheric tension of a crime thriller and the soulful revelation of a romance, Park transcends both genres, avoiding their tendency to exploit the extremes of human experience (radiant love or violent suffering) for voyeuristic entertainment. Instead, he constructs a lush, visually stunning portrait of profound affection and quiet brutality that asks whether violence — witnessed, endured or performed — can ever be a sustainable form of escapism.
The film begins in present-day Busan, where the even-keeled veteran detective Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) spends his weeks rooting out urban crime before heading home for tranquil weekends in the suburbs with his wife Jung-an (Lee Jung-hyun.) When he is called to investigate the mysterious rock-climbing death of an immigration bureaucrat, Hae-jun finds himself drawn to the main suspect, the man’s young wife Seo-rae (Tang Wei.) As the investigation progresses, the pair develop a risky emotional connection and Hae-jun slows down in his search for answers, beginning to question which side he’s on.
From the first glimpse of the crime scene, Park paints the murder mystery in rich, Hitchcockian visuals, highlighting its delightfully theatrical location (a towering rock spire topped with an ancient tree) with engrossing camerawork. In one unforgettable moment, Hae-jung gazes down at the dizzying distance the victim fell when he tumbled off the peak and the shot flips to the dead man’s point of view, gazing up at his faraway figure through cloudy eyes as an ant crosses his cornea. The “murder victim point-of-view” approach could certainly be corny if executed with less precision, but the shot stuns with its symmetrical pastiche of sky and silhouette, deep hues, and a shifting focus that frames Hae-jung as an epic hero with a long way to fall.
Throughout the film, these kinds of intensely dramatic moments are balanced by comic breaks, preventing the film’s serious stakes from becoming suffocating. In one early moment that drew laughs inside the festival’s Debussy Theater, Hae-jun insists on following the route the man climbed and drags his protege Soo-wan (Go Kyung-pyo) along on a hilariously grim belay trip up the rock, during which they count the places the body bounced off the wall. The police scenes that mimic detective procedurals are distinguished by their brisk, engaging pace (you won’t find any “Under The Banner of Heaven”-style pauses to stare woefully at the corpse) and growing focus on romantic rather than rival tension between the detective and suspect, which blossoms into vivid clarity during their interrogation-room conversations. With techniques like these, Park illustrates that the film’s murder mystery is not really its focal point, nor the case that will give Hae-jun purpose as a detective. Instead, it is a poetic and quickly obvious puzzle that leads him into the arms of his suspect.
The real center of the film, of course, lies in this love story. Park is a master of quiet tension, and “Decision to Leave” electrifies with a slow-burn romance with mature stakes, empathetically portraying how two characters are pulled in different directions by obligation and desire. Tang is intense and disarming as the black-widow-suspect, perfectly countered by Park’s performance of tormented obsession. Their chemistry is immediately captivating, conveying a deep and mesmerizing connection long before they act on their feelings. Theirs is the kind of atmospheric love story that comes around once in a blue moon, reminiscent of Wong Kar-wai’s stone-cold classic “In the Mood For Love.”
The efficacy of their connection, though, arises largely because it is explored beyond their chemistry. Park illustrates how Hae-jun and Seo-rae are drawn together not only by their mutual attraction but also by their shared gravitation toward violence as a form of solace. Hae-jun is a figure of tortured restlessness, treating his insomnia by poring over cases and holding stakeouts late into the night. By the time his frustrated wife asks why he needs to obsess over murders to be happy, it’s clear that his gruesome work is the only way he knows how to escape from his anxieties. As Seo-Rae’s motivations are cast into sharper focus, violence appears as one of the only tools she has for control, allowing her to escape the miseries of her life and pursue her own desires for the first time.
Through Hae-jun and Seo-rae’s stories, Park presents two people who have seen the costs of brutality firsthand but are still brought to life by it. As they recognize this perverse attraction in each other, their cursed love becomes impossible to look away from, offering a more immersive escape than either has ever encountered. But as Park’s film asks, does the blood spilled behind them bind them together or doom them to unhappiness? Can two people conditioned by violent obsessions ever turn away from them, or have they been indelibly shaped?
These are fitting questions for fans of Park’s films, which have brilliantly examined the role of violence in human society and relationships since the beginning of his career, when his deliciously unflinching “Vengeance” trilogy presented three takes on the ways ordinary people are driven to brutality by the world’s cruelties. By the 2014 arrival of “The Handmaiden,” Park’s thoughtful portrayal of violence had become a calling card of sorts, standing apart from a theatrical marquis dominated by action movies, dark dramas, and true crime flicks that spilled blood for spectacle. “The Handmaiden,” a gorgeous love story, is also not for the faint of stomach, with graphic representations of abuse that propels its heroines toward revenge and escape. The constellation of Park’s filmography is populated by characters who defy typical narratives, forcing audiences to confront their own similarities to heroes and villains alike. Through Park’s eyes, violence has never been the sole purview of gangsters, wife-beaters, elites, or the downtrodden; it has never been purely evil or utilitarian. Instead, it appears at the root of complex character traumas, along the path of self-realization, or in the aftermath of alienation — a source of self-destruction, renewal, or rot.
Like his others, Park’s latest film traces the creeping tentacles of violence throughout its characters’ lives, but it goes further to challenge the idea that one can passively witness and obsess over violence without developing an unhealthy relationship to it. In the midst of a true crime resurgence in popular media, graphic but depersonalized tales of murder and intrigue have filled streaming sites and podcast charts, creating growing communities of devotees who bond over their mutual fascination with brutal cases. What does it mean, as Park’s film asks, that these relationships are built on a shared escapism through other people’s trauma? And how does shifting focus toward these mutual bonds leave the violent histories themselves lost in the background?
Ultimately, Park’s newest film is a masterpiece of visual and narrative poetry, delving into these ideas with a singularly rich aesthetic vision. Though the film has been called understated in comparison to “The Handmaiden,” its cinematography still stuns with luxuriant colors, gorgeous framing, and impeccable lighting, all bolstered by sleek and simple production design. The luminous final beach sequence is one of the most beautiful shots I have seen all year. And throughout the film, Park’s thriller casually incorporates today’s ubiquitous surveillance tech and imbues it with a heightened suspense factor, using tech-inspired visual effect shots (including a moment when viewers see Seo-rae taking a polygraph from inside the screen of the polygraph monitor) to give the movie a quiet sci-fi edge.
“Decision to Leave” joins Park’s other films with a brilliant examination of violence and its meaning, but diverges with its soulful, affecting love story and beautifully-drawn contemporary setting. As Seo-rae and Hae-jun’s romance is torn apart by the violence from which it arose, one is reminded of a haunting line by poet Hanif Abdurraqib. “I wish this type of betrayal on no one,” he writes, “Being born out of that which will be your undoing.”

Leverett House Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras announced their departure on Tuesday, a move that comes just four years after their arrival in the house.
Farrell and Ferreras, who replaced longtime faculty deans Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi at Leverett in 2018, will officially leave their posts later this month. In April, Leverett Resident Dean Katie Daily also announced that she would be stepping down from her position.
In an email to Leverett affiliates on Tuesday, Farrell and Ferreras wrote that it was “with deepest sadness” that they would be leaving the house.
“This was a very difficult decision to make, but we are grateful for the time we have had, and the many warm memories of you,” they wrote. “We believe this decision is the best for us and our family as we enter a new chapter of our lives.”
The pair wrote that they have “thoroughly enjoyed” their experience and felt an “overwhelming feeling of belonging” as faculty deans of Leverett.
“We created so many memories with you, and forged lifelong friendships along the way,” Farrell and Ferreras wrote. “It has been a pleasure and honor to serve you through these years, and to learn your interests and passions, as well as your needs and challenges.”
In 2019, a year after settling into their new roles, Farrell and Ferreras received complaints from Leverett students over the closure of common spaces and infrequent house events.
Over Farrell and Ferreras’ four-year tenure, Leverett has had three different resident deans:Daily, Bilal A. Malik, who departed mid-year in 2019, and interim resident dean Catherine Shapiro. Cabot House is the only other house to have had three different resident deans in the past four years.
Despite leaving their roles as faculty deans, Farrell remains an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor and curator at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, while Ferreras continues to curate the orchid collections of the Harvard University Herbaria, per the announcement.
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to Leverett affiliates on Wednesday that the College will soon appoint interim faculty deans. During the upcoming academic year, the College will initiate a search for new faculty deans with student input, including nominations to the post.
“I am grateful for all that they have done to enrich the Leverett House community, and I wish them success and happiness in their future endeavors,” Khurana wrote of the outgoing faculty deans.
