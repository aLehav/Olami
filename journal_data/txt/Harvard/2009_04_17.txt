Singer-songwriter Sara B. Bareilles hits Tercentenary Theater to perform at Yardfest on Sunday afternoon. Bareilles, who nabbed two Grammy nominations in 2009 for “Best Female Pop Vocal Performance” and “Song of The Year”, chats with FM about college, love songs, and bird poop. 1. Fifteen Minutes: Rumor has it you’re also performing at MIT’s Spring Concert. Who do you think will have the crazier, wilder crowd? It’s OK, you can be honest. Sara B. Bareilles: They’re both pretty smart campuses, so I hope they’re smart enough not to be too rowdy. I think you guys are gonna be pretty rowdy in a good way, that’s what I’m expecting. So don’t disappoint me, okay? 2. FM: You’ve done shows with Maroon 5, Mika, and now Ratatat. Can you give us the scoop on any backstage drama? SBB: I know the boys in Maroon 5 the best, and they’re kind of drama free, which is kind of boring, actually. They’re really good boys and they treat us great. I don’t have any juicy gossip, though. 3. FM: Do you have any performance rituals, before you begin a show? SBB: We have a little game that we play, the band and I. We stand in a circle and clap and yell out random words that come to our minds. It sounds absolutely ridiculous and makes no sense whatsoever, but it always makes us laugh and loosens us up. 4. FM: Who’s next? Anyone you’d like to work with in the future? SBB: Lots of people. I’d love to do something with Counting Crows at some point. I’m also a big fan of KT Tunstall. There are so many cool artists out there. 5. FM: If you weren’t obscenely talented (we know you were voted “Most Talented” in high school) and you couldn’t be a singer, what would you be doing? SBB: I don’t know, I can’t imagine doing anything else. It would probably have something to do with animals or horses. I’m a total animal nut. I would probably find myself at a zoo somewhere. 6. FM: Do you have any hidden talents? SBB: Gosh, not really, how sad is that? I do ride horses. I can’t like juggle or anything, I wish I could. I’m not that cool. I know a lot about the “Golden Girls,” though, so I’d be really good at “Golden Girls” Trivia. 7. FM: We saw on your Twitter that on Oct. 2, 2008, a bird pooped on your hair, and that on March 14, 2009, a bird pooped in your beer. Some cultures think that bird poop is a sign of good luck. Anything lucky happen recently? SBB: Ummm...I don’t know if I see any correlation between bird shit and luck. But I feel like a lead a pretty lucky life. I hope I’m not jinxing myself and I don’t get hit by a car right now. [Pause] That was a waste of good beer. 8. FM: In 2002, you graduated from UCLA with a degree in Communications. Have you found any real-world uses for those boring classes you had to sit through? SBB: I think my time studying communications wasn’t mostly about a trade than it was about experiencing college, which was about self-exploration. I don’t pull out those series and things often, but I had a good time while I was there. 9. FM: In college you won Spring Sing, UCLA’s annual music competition. Twice. You sang in Awaken a Capella, a co-ed a Capella group. How did the music scene at UCLA prepare you for life in the industry? SBB: It was a good jumping off point. But I don’t know if there’s anything good that can prepare you for this industry, it’s a really bizarre world. 10. FM: In 2004, Awaken a Capella appeared on the “Best of College a Capella” album singing your hit, “Gravity.” What’s it like to have a legacy at UCLA? SBB: It’s so cool! Its an honor to feel like people in that world kind of respect me and want to sing the music that I write. It’s super cool and flattering. 11. FM: You were nominated twice for Grammy awards in 2009. Where were you when you found out you were nominated, and how did it feel? SBB: I was at home at my piano, writing. I was avoiding watching the telecast because I didn’t want to care. I really wouldn’t have expected to be nominated. So I was doing my own thing and my manager called me. I screamed, and then I ran around my apartment and called everyone I knew. It was the most amazing honor to be nominated. I was on cloud nine for a really long time. 12. FM: What’s next for you? SBB: I’ll be working on the next record. I’ll be home over the summer doing some writing. We can expect a new record in the next year.13. FM: We have to ask: so who was it that you didn’t write a “Love Song” for? SBB: That was for my record company, out of frustration that I had displeased them somehow. 14. FM: “Love Song” hit the Billboard Pop 100 chart number 1 spot back in 2007. Do you ever get sick of singing it? SBB: Unfortunately, yes. It comes and goes. It’s one of those songs that I’m eternally grateful for. I never want to complain about it because it’s opened so many doors, but there are days where I don’t want to sing it. 15. FM: Can you write me a love song?SBB: Absolutely. I will e-mail it to you tomorrow.

Student band Stealth Foxx will take the stage at the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub this Sunday as the winners of the Student Band Contest at the first-ever official Yardfest After Party. The contest is a new Yardfest addition, developed by the College Events Board and the Harvard Concert Commission, a student-run committee that organizes campus-wide events and seeks to bring professional entertainment to Harvard.  Both groups hoped that adding a student band to Yardfest would help keep the excitement going after Yardfest, said HCC Director Julia Goldenheim ’10. Stealth Foxx was chosen from approximately 10 bands that submitted up to three songs for evaluation by members of HCC and CEB, she said.“We were looking for something that would both sit well in atmosphere of the pub and go well with other artists we have,” said Goldenheim, referring to singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles and electronic music group Ratatat, who will be performing earlier that evening at Yardfest. Steath Foxx is composed of R. Derek Wetzel ’10 on keyboard and vocals, guitarist John “Jay” J. Costa, Jr. ’09, bassist Mike Leitzel, and drummer Peter Simonelli, a student at the Art Institute of Boston.Stealth Foxx was notified of their selection on the night of April 14. “We had prepared a couple of tracks specifically for this...so we had our fingers crossed,” Costa said. “It was definitely a surprise,” Wetzel added, “It was really exciting to be selected.” The band stood out because of their unique sound, Goldenheim said. Costa described the band’s music as “rock with a jazz and folk influence.” Above all, he added, their music was spontaneous, featuring improvisation that makes each show a unique experience.Wetzel and Costa have been playing together since high school, but the current band was formed only this year.The band is currently working on its debut album and performs at Harvard and other locations in Cambridge and Boston. It recently won a battle of the bands held at Church Restaurant & Nightclub in Boston. The After Party and the Student Band Contest may become a regular part of Yardfest in the future.  “If the student response is good, we’d love to continue it after this year,” Goldenheim said.

Speaking in front of a packed Sackler Museum Auditorium on Thursday, Scottish novelist and law professor Alexander McCall-Smith admitted to writing about real-life acquaintances in his fiction. “I take great pleasure in putting real people into books. I take their permission, well, not entirely,” he said, before warning event host Professor Arthur I. Applbaum that he might come up in a future novel. McCall-Smith, a former professor of medical ethics at the University of Edinburgh, was born in Zimbabwe and lived for many years in Botswana. His fictional oeuvre includes “The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency” series, about the adventures of Mma Ramotswe, a female detective in Botswana, and the “Sunday Philosophy Club” series, featuring the philosopher Isabel Dalhousie, as well as serial fiction works.In his talk, “How to Do Things with People who Aren’t: The Moral Responsibility of the Author,” McCall-Smith used examples from his work and life to illustrate the thorny relationship between an author and his readers.“[McCall-Smith] is a great writer who also has a background in law and medical ethics, and we wanted him to bring those disparate strands together in a philosophical reflection on his work,” Applbaum, the acting Director of the Kennedy School’s Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics, said when asked why he had invited McCall-Smith to deliver the Safra Center’s last public lecture of the year. During the speech, he touched on the complex theoretical issues raised by readers’ investment in fictional works, especially when the line between fictional characters and reality becomes blurry.He said that this was especially pertinent to serial fiction and book series. He added that both non-fiction and fiction writers have a moral responsibility to their readers. “The fact that fiction is not real is not the point: the reader responds as it if is real,” he said. He characterized serial fiction in particular as a type of contract between writer and reader in which the reader agrees to keep reading as long as the writer produces satisfying work. McCall Smith said that he accepts this obligation.“It considerably constricts my freedom of action, but in a way that I don’t regret,” he said.Several audience members said that they enjoyed McCall-Smith’s musings. “I found him hilarious and captivating,” said attendee Anne Banhill. “It was an entertaining, witty and deeply philosophical meditation on a subject all too rarely studied by ethicists and philologists,” said David Brendel.

The Massachusetts House of Representatives unveiled their version of the state budget on Wednesday, a plan that closes the $3.6 billion budget shortfall with federal stimulus funds, cuts in services and programs, and a reduction in local aid to cities and towns.The House Ways and Means committee submitted a $27.44 billion budget for fiscal year 2010—$532 million less than what was proposed by Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 three months ago. That same month, Patrick made a midyear budget cut of $128 million, leading to a local aid decrease of approximately $2.6 million for the City of Cambridge for fiscal year 2009. The House’s budget relies on $1.46 billion in federal stimulus aid, cancels a planned $97 million transfer to a state rainy day fund, and makes over $1.8 billion in cuts to state programs and services. Unlike the governor’s plan, which proposed $587 million in new taxes, the House plan does not include any new taxes nor does it draw from the remaining $1.3 billion in the rainy day fund.“In crafting this budget, the Committee was faced with an array of distasteful choices as a result of the global fiscal crisis,” wrote committee chairman Charles A. Murphy in a letter to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. “It is impossible to make budget cuts of this magnitude without adversely affecting wide portions of our society.”After the state House debates and revises the budget, the state Senate will draft a budget of their own. A final plan for state funds will be a compromise between these two and will be submitted to Patrick by July 1.  The budget slashes aid to local communities by $424 million, a 25 percent reduction in the funding the state will distribute this year even after Patrick’s midyear cuts.According to State Representative Alice K. Wolf, Cambridge will see an approximate drop of $7 million in local aid as a result. Across Massachusetts, cities and towns are struggling to cope with the aid reduction, considering measures such as slashing police and fire services, laying off workers, and imposing new taxes, Wolf said.“We knew it was going to be an awful budget,” said Wolf. “But it’s worse than we thought.”Cambridge City Councillor Sam Seidel said that Cambridge has coped well with local aid cuts thus far and has avoided mass layoffs and drastic reductions in services.But with yesterday’s House budget announcement, Seidel said that Cambridge now has to make tough decisions about how to absorb the cuts. According to Seidel, this is the largest cut in local aid in the state’s history.“These cuts are real, and there’s no other source to make up this money,” Seidel said. “This cut is going to be reflected somewhere in the city’s money.”Cambridge officials are currently working on the city budget for fiscal year 2010, which will soon be presented to the City Council. However, Seidel said that the budget will probably need to be revised in order to factor in these new local aid cuts.City Spokesperson Ini Tomeu said that there have not yet been meetings about Wednesday’s House budget, but that budget hearings will take place soon.Beside cutting local aid, the state budget will impact a wide range of state programs and services. The budget looks to eliminate the Quinn Bill, which increases the salary of police officers who earn college degrees, and will cut $5.9 million in aid for public libraries, $2.8 million for suicide prevention programs, and $16 million for community-based services for the elderly and disabled.In forming the budget, the House Committee on Ways and Means relied on a projected $19.53 billion in tax collections, a figure that Wolf said may need to be revised as per capita income drops.Wolf said that her constituents in Cambridge have expressed a preference for tax increases rather than “Draconian cuts in services.”According to Wolf, state lawmakers have been discussing a number of options to raise revenue and minimize the budget cuts, including raising taxes for hotels, restaurants, and telecommunications companies, as well as broad-based income and sales tax increases.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Ilya B. Leskov, a first-year student at Harvard Medical School, and Matthew D. Zimmerman ’09 were awarded the Philip Hofer Prize this month for assembling artistic and literary collections that best captured the spirit of the prize’s namesake, a former Houghton Library curator.  Leskov, a Lowell House tutor, received first prize for his collection of antique maps of Paris—an assortment consisting of more than 25 maps, a substantial bibliography, and colored photographs of the maps.“I was always interested in how the city grew and evolved over time.” said Leskove, who said he had compiled many of his maps after studying abroad in Paris during his junior year in college.To decorate his room, Leskov purchased many maps at live auctions and on Ebay, forming the seed for what would eventually be his award-winning collection.  “The maps showed how the city was depicted in different ways over time,” said Leskov, whose maps spanned from the 15th to the 19th century.Leskov was awarded $2,000 and will showcase his collection in Lamont Library.  Taking second place and a $1,000 prize was Zimmerman, a Tennessee Valley native who entered his collection of books by authors such as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren, writers who were either wrote about the Tennessee Valley or were from the region.The Philip Hofer Prize, established to foster students’ interest in collecting, was founded in honor of Philip Hofer ’21, the first Curator of the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts in the Houghton Library and Secretary of the Fogg Art Museum. To enter, students were required to submit a 2,500-word essay describing the meaning and sentimentality of their collections in addition to annotated bibliographies detailing the items.  Hope Mayo, Philip Hofer Curator of Printing and Graphic Arts in Houghton Library, served as the judge of the Philip Hofer Prize and said she looks for a “unifying idea that illustrated the collector’s conception of the material,” and that both prize-winning collections “met the scope and the originality of the idea.”Both winning collections will be displayed in Lamont Library before Reunion and Commencement Week, Mayo said.

The Dalai Lama will visit the Boston area at the end of April, and plans to spend two days at Harvard during his stay. Harvard faculty and staff have been preparing for the Dalai Lama’s visit on April 30th for the past year, according to Lobsang Sangay,  a research fellow at Harvard Law School who served as the coordinator of the Dalai Lama’s visit to New England. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, will spend his time in the area giving talks and participating in conferences. He has travelled to Harvard twice in the past 15 years. The Dalai Lama will give a talk called “Educating the Heart” at Memorial Church on April 30 in front of over 900 faculty and students. The event’s lottery closed on Wednesday.After the talk, the Dalai Lama plans to plant a tree with University President Drew Faust, and later receive a citation from Harvard, said Sangay. The following day, he will participate in a panel discussion called “Meditation and Psychotherapy—Cultivating Compassion and Wisdom,” at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, organized by the Harvard Medical School’s Department of Psychiatry and the Cambridge Health Alliance. There, the Dalai Lama will speak on compassion and wisdom along with several Harvard professors, including psychology professor Steven Pinker.On May 2, the Tibetan Organization of Boston is sponsoring a morning sermon, on the Four Noble Truths, and a public talk on the path to happiness at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough according to Harvard Buddhist chaplain Lama Migmar Tseten. Tickets for the event are available on Ticketmaster.com.“He is a like a rock star; he could probably fill the stadium,” said Professor of Tibetan and Himalayan Studies Leonard W. J. van der Kuijp. “He is a very kind and charismatic man, and many will be excited to see him.”Local Tibetans crafted a throne for the Dalai Lama to sit on during the teaching, which they unveiled last Saturday.“We are very excited and honored to host His Holiness, so a local Tibetan carpenter and tailor built a throne for His Holiness,” said Pema T. Shastri, a spokesman for the Tibetan Association of Boston. “It has taken several months to build the throne.” Sangay said he hopes the throne will eventually be placed in a Tibetan Heritage Center, which the Association plans to build in the next few years.  He added that he believes the careful planning will result in a educational and exciting experience for the Harvard community.“We have gone through every detail of his schedule minute by minute, and the various security measures we will take,” Sangay said. “We are looking forward to good visit.”

After initially mandating that House Masters cut their annual budgets by 15 percent earlier this semester—in line with trimming guidelines for most departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—Harvard’s administration is now forcing Houses to slash yearly budgets by a quarter.
To comply with the 25 percent reduction in their budgets, House Masters, resident deans, and other House administrators said they will have to reduce the number and quality of student activities in their Houses—including Masters’ Open Houses and study breaks—and may have to reduce tutor meal plans and reconfigure some staff positions altogether.
The possibility of layoffs among House staff has caused Masters to react with both “astonishment and chagrin,” said one House Master, who wished to remain unnamed, in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday. 
For the last three decades, the number of employees serving in House Offices has stayed constant, said Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck in an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday. 
In Lowell, she said, two full-time House Office employees—a House administrator and a staff assistant—have handled the archiving and maintenance of student records, including those of recent alumni.
The staff assistant—a position 
called the assistant to the resident dean in some Houses—is closely involved in the paperwork related to pre-law, pre-med, and graduate school records and letters.
But now, the College administration is asking Eck and other Masters to convert the staff assistant position into a half-time job. As a result, one administrator may have to handle files from two Houses—which would require overseeing more than 700 student files in some cases, Eck said. 
In addition, the individual would only be employed for 10 months of the year. But because of the staff assistant’s role in post-undergraduate file upkeep, this schedule “would not be helpful” to students, Eck said, adding that pre-med application work occurs during the summer. 
While House office staff size has remained constant over the years, the number of employees in the central College administration has increased significantly. In the last 10 years, 230 additional administrative staff across FAS have been added to the College payroll, Eck said. 
Eck called this trend a “misplaced emphasis in terms of the weight of central College staff” and noted that the Advising Programs Office has expanded from one to six staffers, for example, while the majority of academic advising happens in the Houses and departments.
Potential changes to the staff assistant position reflect Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith’s comments during Tuesday’s town hall meeting, when he called for a broad-based restructuring of the College in response to a budget deficit of $220 million.
House Masters, who said they were frustrated with a “moving target” of budget-cut expectations, added that they would oppose any “fait accompli” (irreversible mandate) calling for staff cuts. The increased—and changing—requirements to trim House budgets have prevented House Masters from finalizing their annual budgets, which are usually submitted in January. 
Resistance to staff reduction from House Masters has been echoed recently by students, who have been protesting layoffs in other parts of the University since early last month.
The potential for House staff layoffs comes in the wake of College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds’ release of the Report on Harvard House Renewal earlier this month, a report that calls for sweeping, specific improvements to House life.
The report recommends upgrading House staff while decreasing the administrative workload of tutors. But decreasing House staff would effectively derail those two goals, House Masters said.
FAS Director of Communications Robert P. Mitchell wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson that the College is “carefully considering how to maintain the possible standards while reducing costs wherever possible.”
He added that departments across the College are considering budget-cut proposals and that no final decisions have been made.

A new bicycle sharing program will give Harvard students access to eight pedal-propelled vehicles this spring as part of a new program sponsored by the Environmental Action Committee that aims to raise awareness for alternative modes of transportation.    Known as VeriFast Bicycles, the new program will station four bicycles each at Mather and Cabot Houses, and will allow students to check the bikes out—along with helmets, locks, and lights—from the superintendent’s office in each house, said Karen McKinnon ‘10, the chair of the Environmental Action Committee. The new program will launch April 25 at the Environmental Action Committee’s Earth Day festivities, where students will be able to see the new bikes and sign waivers to participate in the bike sharing.The program will debut just two months after the city of Boston announced that it would move ahead with a bike-sharing program, set to launch in 2010, that aims eventually to residents access to 6,000 communal bicycles. The Harvard program will begin with only eight loanable bicycles, but the Committee intends to use the initial responses of students as a barometer for how fast the program should grow, McKinnon said. “The hope is that over time we will expand the program into either every single house or, at the very least, every neighborhood of houses,” stated McKinnon.Alex Gation, an employee at the Quad Bike Shop in Cambridge, said he thought the time was right for a bike sharing program to succeed.“The demand for alternative means of transportation on campus has increased tremendously lately,” he said. “Our store has been so busy with bicycle and tune-up requests that we are struggling just to keep up with the rapidly growing demand for bicycles.”In 2004, the Environmental Action Committee proposed an initiative to the student body that allowed them to add a $10 fee to their term bill to help fund innovative wind energy on campus, McKinnon said. The administration vetoed the initiative, but pledged to match any amount of funding that the Environmental Action Committee could raise for other environmentally-friendly projects—including the bike sharing program, McKinnon said. For his part, bike shop employee Gation offered a positive prognosis for the program.   “Any program which allows students to move around campus efficiently and inexpensively will most likely be successful,” said Gation. “I think that this loanable bike initiative will quickly gain popularity amongst the students.”

Facing severe financial pressures, MIT administrators announced this week that they would cut some of the school’s varsity athletic programs by the end of April—a move that gives Harvard sole claim to having the most varsity teams of any school in the nation.The news of the cuts came after MIT announced that its Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation would have to reduce its spending over the next three years by $1.45 million. Its current annual budget is $12.9 million.  MIT athletic officials are currently meeting with student athletes, coaches and interested alumni in order to decide which five to eight teams will be removed from the varsity program. Both Harvard and its neighbor downriver currently have 41 varsity sports teams—tied for most in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. With its recent announcement, MIT—which already cut junior varsity programs earlier this year—joins the ranks of schools such as John Hopkins, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and the University of Vermont, all of which have cut varsity programs in the past three months in response to the financial downturn.  “Since well before the current financial crisis, we have faced hard questions about how to sustain our broad scope of offerings at the level of excellence that participants have come to expect,” Julie Soriero, MIT’s Director of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation said in a statement about the cuts early this week. MIT’s announcement did not go unnoticed by the school’s student athletes, many of whom have been petitioning to postpone the cuts and to raise awareness of the importance of collegiate athletics. MIT junior Cathy Melnikow, who chairs the MIT Undergraduate Association’s Committee on Athletics, said it was a “terrible feeling” for students to be left in limbo about the future of sports they had played for their entire lives.“The last competition you played [may have been] three months ago,” she said.MIT’s cuts have left some varsity Crimson captains wary that Harvard may have to make sacrifices as well. “[Varsity cuts] have crossed my mind,” said Harvard ski team captain Anna R. Schulz ’09. “But Harvard really seems to pride itself on its having 41 different sports.” Some Crimson athletes have already seen what they say are subtle attempts by the athletics department to save.“I’ve definitely noticed, at least in track, we’ve been doing some budgeting, making sure that we are not getting unnecessary equipment and the like,” said junior cross country captain Kelsey B. LeBuffe ’10. “Some minor constraints, but nothing major.”Harvard Director of Athletic Communications Kurt Svoboda made it clear in an e-mail that the University did “not anticipate reducing [its] varsity sports programs.” MIT Undergraduate Association President Noah Jessop said that he did not think the cuts would have much of an effect on the college decisions of current MIT admits.   “I think that MIT is certainly an environment where, for a majority of students, academics are first and foremost,” he said. “Regardless of the cuts, I don’t think it will affect the decisions of the class of 2013.”But the Crimson’s Schulz and Le Buffe disagreed, saying that they believed the potential for athletic participation was an important part of the college decisions for incoming freshmen.“I’d probably really reconsider going to that school,” Schulz said. “I know I would not have come to Harvard if they didn’t have a ski team.”

Legendary Ec10 Professor, former Bush aide, textbook author, and all around good guy N. Gregory Mankiw’s too popular for Facebook. In a blog post Monday, he said that he had reached the social networking site’s friend limit and, as a result, had no need for it anymore.
"For the past couple years, I have used the account for the sole purpose of accumulating 'friends'," Mankiw wrote. "Now, Facebook tells me that I have reached my upper limit! So there is little point in keeping the account."  More of FlyBy's take after the jump.
Right. So here's the deal: if you were one of the lucky 5,000 people that made it in under the cap, don’t get too cocky – he doesn’t really think you’re friends. Notice that in the post, Mankiw puts friends in quotations. Kind of like how he “teaches” Ec 10. (Just kidding Professor Mankiw. FlyBy actually loved your class, and your book, but our editors make him come up with these crowd-pleasing snark-attacks.)
Facebook has long had a 5,000 friend limit, mainly for reasons of space limits. The recent change to the “new” facebook was expected to increase or eliminate the cap, but apparently it didn’t. The cap isn’t a problem for us because we aren’t so loved.  
Mankiw himself could not be reached for comment on his friend situation yesterday.

We at FlyBy try to avoid the overtly navel-gazey as often as possible, but this week something came up that was just too good not to tell you about.
For The Crimson's joint Arts and FM issue on fiction this week, a number of writers on campus submitted their work for publication. While all published submissions were high quality, one in particular stood out not only for its incredible narrative, but for its sheer lasciviousness.
Kathleen E. Hale '09 takes the cake with "Finagled," a racy tale of a woman struggling with her sexuality in a male-dominated world of mediocrity.   Read past the jump for some excerpts, but be warned: you may want to put the kids to bed for this one. It gets a little explicit.
Here are some of the highlights from "Finagled":
Poor girl. FlyBy knows just how you feel. No, wait. Maybe not so much.
We'll give you one more little snippet, the rest is up to you to read (or listen to...trust us you wanna do this) on your own.
“Okay,” she sighed. “Now you can begin.” 
These are some of the less graphic/explicit passages in the story. Let's just say things get wilder when sex swings and an apparatus like the one above make their appearance.
Now, FlyBy knows smut when it sees it, and this is certainly a lot more than just smut, but you'll have to find that out for yourself. If you need any further encouragement, Hale is widely considered one of the best fiction authors on campus, and has recently won the Louis Begley Prize for fiction and the Advocate's Contest Issue. While you're at it, you might as well check out some other choice submissions. Happy reading!

This week Fifteen Minutes sits down with Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sara B. Bareilles to chat about college, love songs, and bird poop.
Check out the interview here and after the jump, find out who Sara didn't write that "Love Song" for!



Fifteen Minutes: We have to ask: so who was it that you didn’t write a "Love Song" for? 

Sara B. Bareilles: That was for my record company, out of frustration that I had displeased them somehow. 
 FM: "Love Song" hit the Billboard Pop 100 chart number 1 spot back in 2007. Do you ever get sick of singing it? 
SBB: Unfortunately, yes. It comes and goes. It’s one of those songs that I’m eternally grateful for. I never want to complain about it because it’s opened so many doors, but there are days where I don’t want to sing it.

The Harvard Advocate's Winter 2009 issue, themed Archives, is now available in or around your dining hall. But before you grab a copy with your hangover tomorrow morning, check out this brief rundown.
One of the coolest features is an 8-page spread of selected Advocate covers dating back to 1866. Other offerings include nostalgia-laced reflections on adolescence and pop music, a time-capsulated historical society, stories about longing, and enigmatic, ecstatic verse (would any issue be complete without it?).
Highlights, alternative quotes, after the jump.
"I don't have to sneak out of people's houses anymore, and I don't get grounded for staying out late. But fear and magic are partners, and one disappears with the other. I learned this riding the lawnmower, with headphones." -"Pop Adolescence" by Richard Beck
"The urgency with which the act of preservation had to be approached sets the mission of the Swift River Valley Historical Society apart from other historical societies: if you were confronted with the imminent destruction of everything you knew, what parts would you take away so that the whole could be remembered?" -"Drowned Towns" by Ben Cosgrove
"He began to feel a sense of urgency. At $100, it was a steal. He wished the shop window were made of lead, so that no passing stranger could witness its discounted shame. Someone would realize it was beautiful, someone would take it away. He had exactly fifty dollars." -"The Buddha" by Maria Xia
"'Ten.' Some people started counting down. 'Nine.' Two buttons of his shirt were open at the collar. 'Eight.' He looked professional and clean. He was tan and blond with with lots of gold hair on his arm. 'Seven.' she wondered if he thought they might. 'Six.' She bet she probably could." -"Orchids" by Carolyn Gaebler
"Plato mistook the good for the sun,
that day in Amsterdam the clouds parted,
you leapt up from the war memorial and
the world had been given back
finally. You heard of people lost their eyes this way."
-"South Pole Station" by Abram Kaplan
"It should of course be obvious by now that the cartographic epistemic system functions in a role closely related to the cognitive task of memory, serving in part as an external memory storage system and in part as a system encoding previously completed cognitive actions. The 'memory content' of the map is  greater than the knowledge of either the user or the creator...." -"Cartography and Memory" by Alexander Fabry
Fabry, Gaebler, and Xia are also Crimson editors.

Armed with only a copy of those “Yardfest 2009” CDs  they've been handing out in front of the Science Center this week, I've been charged with giving you all the lowdown on the music of both our guests, electronic duo Ratatat and pop-rock singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, before Sunday's performance in Tercentenary Theater.
The CD opens with Ratatat’s “Wildcat," a sleek and sexy track whose almost predatory feel is only reinforced by the recurring cougar-scream that haunts the piece. Following this prelude is “Seventeen Years,” a sort of Ratatat anthem if you will: with its rhythmic march and searing synth overlay, it conjures images of an army’s worth of cigarette-jean clad hipsters readying for battle.
Two more electronic fantasias, “Lex” and “Cherry,” complete this theme before the scene explodes and the part of Yardfest you and your wastey-faced blockmates have been waiting for arrives: “Diamonds” and “Party and Bullshit” represent the other half of Ratatat’s talent, namely, the remixing of ass-to-crotch grinding (his/her crotch grinding on your ass, that is to say) hiphop tracks.
Yet as Ms. Bareilles swoops in with “Love Song,” her cotton-candy pop radio gem, it becomes apparent that Bareilles’ music is nothing to dance to. Seriously, listen to the five-track set, which represents some of Bareilles’ most popular work. Lots of emotion and love (what? I hate emotion…) might leave you burning off the drunk you’ve built up all afternoon.
All this said, Yardfest 2009 will certainly be an entertaining spectacle. But with some healthy doses of pre-gaming,  Monday morning (yes, yes, it's on Sunday) promises to be more so.
