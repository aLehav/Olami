After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seniors, here's one more reason why Commencement will be awesome: the first ever Boston Calling music festival will take place over Memorial Day Weekend (May 25 and 26). Mainstream juggernauts fun., fresh off a double win at the Grammys, headline a roster of talented indie acts. With The Shins and The National also at the top of the bill and local Boston food trucks scheduled to line the venue at City Hall Plaza, Boston Calling is set to be a memorable event.
The festival's lineup was curated in part with the help of The National's Aaron Dessner, whose band will headline on Sunday night. The National has slowly but surely become one of the best American rock bands of the last decade: buoyed by pretty piano melodies, dark and vivid lyrics, and Matt Berninger's sorrowful baritone, in recent years they've released several critically successful albums. They're also set to release a new album in May, so expect some new songs and a whole lot of fervent enthusiasm from the band's devotees, who have been waiting for three years for new material.
The rest of the lineup is indicative of both Dessner's musical tastes and his social circle: it comprises almost entirely young, staid indie rockers that will no doubt appeal to Boston's college-heavy population. There's not too much to say about Of Monsters and Men, Young the Giant, and Portugal. the Man, except that they're generally good at songwriting, have richly textured sounds, and write obtuse lyrics. While some performing groups like Matt & Kim clearly have the energy and stage presence to excite a crowd, it's hard not to think that the atmospheric swirls of Caspian or Youth Lagoon might be better suited to the dorm room than an outdoor spring weekend.
The most intriguing pick is Bad Rabbits, an R&B/metalcore band and the sole representative of Boston's local music scene. This furious, genre-hopping group has gained local fans ever since forming in 2007, and its full length debut, "American Love," is slated to drop in the next couple of months; the group described the album's sound as "futuristic funk, post-R&B rock" to The Crimson. Given the cerebral prettiness of much of the festival's lineup—including Andrew Bird, Dirty Projectors, and the Walkmen—it might not be a bad idea to head over to Bad Rabbits' set for some good old-fashioned moshing.
Also playing: Cults, Ra Ra Riot, MS MR, Marina and the Diamonds, St. Lucia

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team was aided on Wednesday by great games from its seniors and a key freshman as it challenged the team from Bryant University.
With a 7-5 win, Harvard improved its record to 3-3 and dropped the Bulldogs to 0-7.
The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday night, but was postponed to 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday due to freezing rain. The weather cleared up just before the new start time, and the two teams met for the first time in their programs’ histories on Harvard’s Soldiers Field.
Bryant jumped out to an early lead, as their leading scorer, junior midfielder Colin Dunster, put them on top with a goal 38 seconds into the game. Dunster would eventually finish with three goals and an assist.
However, the Crimson’s leading scorer for the season, senior midfielder Alex White, quickly responded with a goal of his own, tying the game at 1-1. The score remained tied until the end of the quarter, when Harvard’s star freshman attack, Devin Dwyer, scored again after an assist from White.
The second quarter belonged entirely to the Crimson, as the team scored three straight goals, all unassisted, in the final half of the quarter including two more from Dwyer and White.
“At halftime it was 5-1,” said senior captain Jason Gonos. “We would have liked to have had a better second half and put them away earlier, but they stuck in the game. They’re a solid team… we knew it would be a tough match.”
In the second half, Bryant tried to claw their way back into contest. The opposing team put the game within one goal 40 seconds into the fourth quarter. Fortunately for the Crimson, however, Dwyer put the game out of reach with his third goal of the game.
“Our first half went better than our second half,” Dwyer said, “But our team showed a lot of poise in the second half, and when Bryant made their run we just stayed confident.”
Last year, insidelacross.com ranked Dwyer as the 4th ranked player coming out of high school. The freshman has lived up to expectations so far. He is the team’s second leading scorer, and showed up in this game with the first hat trick of his career as well as an assist.
“I think my teammates did a great job and happened to make me look good,” Dwyer said. “It really all goes to them.”
The young attackman’s 10 goals and 10 assists combine for a team-leading 20 points.
“He’s really shown that he is a major threat on the field,” Gonos said about his younger teammate. “He’s been a great feeder for us, so it was awesome to see him get his own goals and get the hat-trick. As a senior, it’s always nice to see a freshman stepping up.”
The Crimson struggled in the game on loose balls, trailing the Bulldogs 17-25 on ground balls and 5-11 on faceoffs.
“They have a good faceoff guy,” Gonos said. “But our faceoff guys are good too and they put up a good fight against them. I think we got some pretty big ground balls in our area … to keep them off the scoreboard.”
Harvard was also less efficient in its clearing game than their opponent, only successfully clearing the ball out of the defensive end on 14 of its 23 opportunities while Bryant went 12-16.
The Crimson also had more penalties than Bryant, giving up four man-up possessions to its opponent’s one. The team did not, however, allow a man-down goal during any of those four penalties.
“We put in a lot of preparation for the game,” said Gonos. “[We] scouted their man-up a lot and were ready.”
Harvard’s success this year is thanks largely to excellent performances from senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger, who leads the Ivy League in saves and ranks second in save percentage with 69 and 57% respectively. In this game, the goalie made 15 saves and notched a percentage of 75%.
“Harry really put on a show today and really kept us in the game,” Dwyer said about his senior teammate. “A lot of his plays have been big for the team, and I guess we owe it all to him.”
In addition, Harvard got excellent play out of Gonos. The defenseman led the Crimson with seven ground balls and helped limit the Bulldogs to only five goals, tied for their fewest total on the season.
Harvard will need more strong play from its seniors and freshmen as it continues with Ivy League play at Dartmouth on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After playing three games over the weekend, the Harvard baseball team received no break and took to the diamond in Texas for four games in just three days.
The Crimson (1-13) failed to pick up a victory on the second leg of its trip, falling to Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in a one-run game, twice to McNeese St., and finally to Houston.
“[These are] tough teams, but we have to play better,” said sophomore third baseman Nick Saathoff. “We’re a better team than we’ve been playing. It’s tough right now, but I think we’re going to be alright.”
HOUSTON 8, HARVARD 1
Although Harvard pushed across the first run of the game, the Crimson ultimately fell, 8-1, to the Cougars (18-4) on Wednesday night.
Houston only had three more hits than Harvard, but the Cougars strung their knocks together and came through with runners in scoring position. Houston center fielder Ashford Fulmer went three-for-four with a pair of triples.
The Crimson struck first in its initial at-bats when freshman catcher Dj Link drew a bases loaded walk that plated freshman second baseman Mitch Klug, who had singled earlier. Klug later registered a double in the seventh for his second hit on the night.
But the Cougars responded by scoring six runs in three innings to take a five-run lead after four frames. The Harvard offense could not push any more runs across the board, and two more in the bottom of the seventh sealed the 8-1 victory for Houston.
“We just have to execute,” Saathoff said. “Our coaches preach it all the time about getting runners over and getting them in. We’re just not doing it; we have to be tougher and more aggressive with two strikes.”
MCNEESE STATE 11, HARVARD 0
Despite playing solid baseball for much of the rubber game of the doubleheader, the Crimson could not handle the Cowboys (12-8) offense in the middle innings and fell in an 11-0 defeat.
McNeese St. scored three in the fourth, five in the fifth, and two in the sixth to put the contest firmly out of reach. The scoring in the fifth frame was keyed by a pair of doubles that brought in all five runs.
A trio of McNeese pitchers held the Harvard offense to four hits. Cowboys starter Jason Gibson made it into the seventh inning to earn the win, and the two relievers each allowed only one hit in closing out the game.
Hitless in his last five games following a five-game hitting streak to begin the season, Link notched a pair of singles to lead the Crimson offense.
Harvard used four pitchers in the defeat. Junior Baron Davis was credited with the loss in his four innings of work. Freshman Shaun Rubin provided a bright spot with two innings of one-hit, shutout work.
“I’m obviously not complacent with where we are right now, but I’m very proud with the strides people have been making,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “Freshmen have to act as if they’ve always been here. They’re on a really quick learning curve because we can’t afford for them to develop slowly.”
MCNEESE STATE 10, HARVARD 0
Although the Cowboys only outhit the Crimson by five in the first-ever game between the two teams, the McNeese St. bats came through when it mattered most en route to a 10-0 shutout in a seven inning contest.
The big blows came in the form of two four-run innings in the first and the fifth. After the first three batters of the game reached base, junior Taylor Drake drove an offering from senior pitcher Matt Doyle over the left field wall for a grand slam.
Four innings later, a triple from junior Matt Williams brought in three more. After Harvard coach Bill Decker replaced Doyle with senior Jordan Haviland, a Cowboys single plated the fourth run of the frame.
Crimson pitchers had trouble retiring the middle of the McNeese St. order all day, as the number two through five hitters accounted for nine of their 12 hits.
Kregel paced the Harvard offense, going three-for-four against the Cowboys pitching. Junior outfielder Jeff Hajdin also posted two hits on the game.
McNeese senior Trey McGee picked up the win with five innings of five-hit ball, while Doyle was credited with the loss.
TEXAS A&M-CORPUS CHRISTI 7, HARVARD 6
The Crimson started off strong and built a five-run lead in search of its first win since the start of the season. But Harvard could not withstand an Islanders (11-9) rally in the middle innings and ultimately fell in a close one, 7-6.
The Crimson offense had its most successful day of the year, amassing season highs of seven runs and 14 hits, thanks in large part to standout performances from three individuals.
Junior shortstop Carlton Bailey went a sparkling five-for-five in the leadoff spot, and sophomore pitcher Tanner Anderson registered a single in each of his four at-bats. Freshman third baseman Mitch Klug also totaled three hits in what were career highs for each player.
Harvard got off to a good start by scoring two runs in the second inning off RBI singles from Anderson and Bailey.
Things looked bright for Harvard when Anderson made it through four innings without allowing a run. In the top of the fifth, the Crimson loaded the bases with no outs and tacked on three additional runs
But the tide turned swiftly in the next two frames, as the A&M-Corpus Christi offense let looses for seven runs in the fifth and the sixth, with the big blow coming in the form of a grand slam from senior outfielder Eric Weiss over the right field fence.
“We put the ball in play, and we were able to string hits together to manufacture runs,” Kregel said. “We gained a lot of momentum early in the game, but a couple small things caused us to lose the momentum, and Corpus Christi really took advantage of that.”
After Anderson exited with Harvard down two, sophomore pitcher Matt Timoney entered and kept the Crimson in the game by holding the Islanders scoreless for the entirety of the contest.
Although the Crimson scratched across a run in the eighth, the team could not get anything going in the ninth and fell by one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard mens volleyball team’s struggles continued on Monday night, as the Crimson continued their spring break tour of California against the Lancers of California Baptist University.
Harvard struggled from the outset, dropping the first game of the best-of-five match. The Crimson managed to go mostly point-for-point with the Lancers during the first stretch of the set, but eventually watched Cal. Baptist run away on a 9-2 run that brought the score to 19-10.
Harvard was unable to recover and lost the game by a score of 25-16. The teams had similar numbers of kills, but were separated by their levels of efficiency. While Harvard had more chances to attack than Cal. Baptist, the Lancers had greater success blocking and hitting accurately.
“It was a pretty brutal match for us,” said sophomore outside hitter DJ White. “We had a tough time stopping their hitters.”
Harvard’s managed a combined kill percentage of.2, whereas Cal. Baptist’s recorded .476, indicating a far higher level of efficiency for the latter. The Lancers also had two aces while the Crimson had none. On the other hand, Harvard did have six serving errors to Cal. Baptist’s two, despite the Lancers serving far more frequently than the Crimson.
“I think the biggest thing that hurt us was the errors,” junior captain Nick Madden remarked. “[Cal. Baptist] is a pretty good team, but I feel like if we had cut down on those errors we would have had a good chance to win.”
CBU also won the second set, this time by a margin of 25-17. The disparity between the teams was evident in their kill tally, as the Lancers finished with 13 kills and the Crimson finished with 10. Both teams had similar kill percentages, but the Lancers had more hitting opportunities and capitalized enough to win the game.
However, Harvard refused to go away without a fight.
In the third set the Crimson battled from a 21-15 deficit to tie the game at 22-22. Harvard then traded points with Cal. Baptist twice, before eventually going ahead 25-24. Other than two one-point leads at the start of the second set, this was the first time in the match that Harvard had held a lead at a critical point.
“I was excited,” Madden said when asked how he felt at the end of the set, “I thought that’s the level of volleyball we should have been playing at the whole time.”
The Lancers continued to play strong, however, as they reclaimed the lead with two straight points and eventually took the set and match by a score of 28-26, and 3-0.
Overall, Cal. Baptist led the Crimson in most of the major statistics. The Lancers had 39 kills to the Crimson’s 32 and a .318 kill percentage to the Crimson’s .234. In addition, they dominated from the service line, racking up seven aces to the Crimson’s one while Harvard committed 17 service errors to CBU’s 14.
Although the match only lasted three sets, Madden had the second-most kills in the game with 12 and a hitting percentage of .333, well above his season averages of 9 and .169, respectively
However, his performance was not enough against the Lancers, who were led by their star Brazilian outside hitter, Levi Cabral. Cabral ranks second in the country in kills per game, and had a game-high 13 in this contest.
“I had no idea going into the match that [Cabral] would be that big of a force,” White said. “He’s a great international player… and you don’t really see that on the east coast.”
Harvard plays a total of three teams over the course of spring break, all in California. On Friday, the unranked Crimson challenged No. 11 UC Santa Barbara, but came up short by a margin of three games to none. On Tuesday night, Harvard plays Concordia (16-5), who also lost to CBU, albeit in five games.
This was expected to be a tough journey for the Crimson. Six out of the last eight national champions and seven of the last ten finalists have been schools located in California. Out of the current rankings, five of the six top teams in the country are from California, as well as six of Harvard’s fourteen players.
“It’s nice playing back home,” said Madden, a native of San Diego. “We are playing some really good teams and are going to get some good exposure out here with some tough competition… I think [the Californian teams] are used to playing a very high level of volleyball every single night, and [I think we] will bring that fire back out to the east coast.”

In the first half of its annual trip to California, the Harvard women’s water polo team had no shortage of time in the pool.
The Crimson (13-6) took part in five games in three days against West Coast foes, coming out on top in the first three and dropping the next two.
Entering the trip, Harvard was off to its best start since the 2004 season, and the team had an eight-game winning streak snapped against UC Davis.
“I’m really happy with the way we’re playing right now,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “We’ve overcome some adversity in the stretches of big games. I hope we can keep growing as a group and play consistently for four quarters every time we play.”
UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC 17, HARVARD 9
In its final game before a day off, the Crimson could not keep up with the Pacific Tigers (15-7) and fell by a score of 17-9.
Both teams entered the matchup coming off a loss after a series of wins, but Pacific rode to victory as five different players scored at least one goal.
Harvard found itself within striking distance at the start of the second half, down by a score of 9-5. But the Tigers took control of the game in the third period with three goals from junior Rebecca Wright, putting Pacific up nine entering the final frame.
Senior Elise Molnar, the only Harvard player to score more than one goal, totaled three on the game. Junior goalie Michele Relton contributed 17 saves for the Tigers in net.
UC DAVIS 18, HARVARD 9
The No. 16 Aggies (12-12) rode consistent offensive production to put an end to the Crimson’s eight-game winning streak in Harvard’s fourth game in two days.
Although junior Shayna Price contributed three goals and three assists, freshman Yoshi Andersen was the only other member of the Crimson to find the back of the net more than once.
Harvard had no answer for senior Carmen Eggert, who paced the UC Davis offense with a career-high six goals, along with three assists and three steals.
“I think [UC Davis and Pacific are] great teams,” sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes said. “It’s a learning experience. It’s a different style of play out in California, and we’re really growing from it as a whole.”
The Aggies took advantage of two strong quarters to build a 10-3 lead at halftime.
Although the Crimson did a better job of staying with UC Davis in the second frame, Harvard could never muster the offense to breach the deficit.
HARVARD 16, FRESNO PACIFIC 6
Playing against the Sunbirds (1-17) in earlier action on Monday, the Crimson rode strong performances from co-captain Aisha Price and freshman Charlotte Hendrix all the way to a ten-goal win.
Price led all scoring with five tallies, and Hendrix found the back of the net four times. Although their combined offense would have been enough, five other players scored to give Harvard its most goals in a game for nearly a month.
With the score tied 1-1 early in the first period, the Crimson went on a five-goal run to seize a commanding lead. The margin was still five at intermission, but Harvard doubled its lead over the course of the second half to coast to victory.
The Crimson excelled defensively in all four quarters, racking up 16 steals. Dukes also amassed seven saves for the third game in a row.
HARVARD 11, OCCIDENTAL 7
The Crimson captured its second win in as many games on Sunday in the form of an 11-7 victory over Occidental (6-14).
Sound defense in the first two quarters gave Harvard a 5-1 lead at the halfway mark. The teams would play an even second frame with six goals scored apiece, but the Tigers could never overcome the early Crimson lead.
The Price sisters fueled the Harvard offense in the victory, with both Shayna and Aisha contributing a hat trick.
Eight Crimson players combined to total 12 steals, and seven assists came from seven different swimmers.
“It’s a total team effort out there,” Minnis said. “All ten girls play; all ten girls are out there working hard. If you look at our scoring, it’s not just one person carrying the load. We spread it out pretty well.”
HARVARD 11, SANTA CLARA 10
The Crimson began its trip to the West Coast with a dramatic one-goal victory over Santa Clara (11-11).
With three minutes to go, Harvard found itself two goals up. But a Broncos goal off a penalty cut the lead to one. Santa Clara called timeout after the Crimson failed to convert on the other end.
In the closing seconds of the game, the Broncos had the ball with a chance to tie. But Dukes came up with a clutch save to secure the victory for Harvard.
The contest went back and forth in the first three quarters, with the score tied at eight entering the final period. But Shayna Price quickly scored two straight goals to give the Crimson a temporary cushion that it would not relinquish.
The Crimson benefited from strong performances from Price and Andersen, who both totaled four goals on the game.
“It is a lot of games in not that many days,” Dukes said. “It’s very much supposed to be a conditioning experience because we do have so few people. We’re looking ahead at our season, and we need to take this grueling week and grow from it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—What began in Vatican City continues on in Salt Lake City.
In the latter of two places known for being religious centers, the Harvard men’s basketball team hopes that what has at times felt like a miracle run lives on to see another day.
The 14th-seeded Crimson (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) will take on the Mountain West champion, third-seeded New Mexico (29-5, 13-3 MWC) tonight at EnergySolutions Arena.
The game, which will take place at 9:50 ET on TNT, marks an unexpected return to the NCAA tournament for Harvard.
Following the preseason departures of former co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the Crimson survived a challenging non-conference schedule and won the conference thanks in large part of the emergence of sophomore wing Wesley Saunders—the league’s leading scorer—and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, the Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
“Anytime you play against a team as well coached as they are, you’ve got a lot of concerns,” said Lobos coach Steve Alford, who played against Harvard’s Tommy Amaker in college. “You have a couple of teams with a little bit of experience [in the tournament], and it’s now about trying to advance further. That’s why it’s a great matchup.”
Keeping the unexpected run going will require the best effort the Crimson has put forward this season. The Lobos finished the regular season ranked No. 1 in the RPI after a year in which it collected a whopping 19 wins against the Top 100, including victories over fellow tournament teams Davidson, Valparaiso, Cincinnati, UNLV, Colorado State, San Diego State, and Boise State.
“I don’t think we’re looking to surprise them,” Saunders said. “We just want to come out and play our game, do the things that have got us to this point all season.”
The Lobos are one of the best defensive teams in the country, ranking 11th in adjusted defensive efficiency. Opponents shot just 39 percent against them, and only two squads made over half their baskets in a game against New Mexico.
But like Harvard, the Lobos have struggled offensively at times, ranking just 172nd in the country with 67.4 points per game. Among tournament participants, New Mexico ranked as the 10th-worst shooting team, while Harvard is the seventh-best. That means that the Crimson could find an advantage if Chambers, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and co-captain Christian Webster can get hot behind the arc.
“We’re going to have to contain their dribble penetration,” New Mexico’s Kendall Williams said. “They can shoot the ball really well, and they play at a high level. So we’re going to have to match that. Hopefully we can implement our game plan and our style so we can get them to play our game.”
Rivard had arguably the best performance of his career in last season’s tournament—when he shot six-for-seven from downtown in a 79-70 loss to Vanderbilt—and Webster said that the experience of having been in the Dance before would benefit the team this time around.
“Just being here last year gives us a sense of comfort,” Webster said. “[I’m] not saying we’re going to make every shot or make every right play, but I guess we will have more confidence and feel a little more relaxed.”
One area of emphasis for the Crimson will be interior defense against a team that, like Harvard, gets to the line a great deal. The Lobos start seven-footer Alex Kirk and 6’9” Australian Cameron Bairstow, while Harvard closed the Ivy season with only the 6’8” Kenyatta Smith surrounded by four guards. Kirk, a sophomore, averaged 12.1 points and eight rebounds a game, while Bairstow contributed 9.6 and 5.8, respectively.
“They have great size up front, there is no question,” Amaker said. “We have tried to spread the floor, use our quickness, and being smaller, there are advantages that we have.”
The best player on a balanced New Mexico squad is arguably Williams, the MWC Player of the Year. The junior—likely to draw Saunders defensively—averaged 13.5 points per game and scored a career-high 46 points on 10-of-13 shooting from three against the Rams last month.
Wing Tony Snell contributed 12.4 points during the regular season and won the conference tournament MVP after averaging 19 points over the course of the Lobos three wins.
“We recognize how good this team is,” Amaker said. “This is an outstanding basketball team.... I think when you look at their team you see balance throughout their roster.”
On Thursday night, Amaker’s team is ready to give that squad its best shot.
“Last year we kind of took [the tournament] for granted,” Webster said. “Now we realize it’s not a given that we’re going to get here every year because we’re lucky to be here right now. I think we’re going to take advantage of the opportunity, and I hope that shows on the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekday game of the season, the Harvard softball team lost a close 8-7 game to Loyola Marymount. The Crimson played its first game since taking its annual trip to San Diego the previous weekend, going 2-3 in the San Diego Classic II.
Harvard fell behind early, with starting pitcher sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz giving up five runs in the first inning. Marymount’s Maciel hit a two-run double to cap the rally inning for the Lions
The Crimson chipped away at the lead through the rest of the game, scoring one in the second, two in the third and two in the fifth, battling back to tie it at 5-5.
However, the Lions came right back scoring three in the bottom of the frame, thanks to two home runs on behalf of the Loyola Maramount offense. Harvard replied with two runs in the top of the sixth, but was unable to score again, dropping its sixth one-run loss of the season.
“We’re definitely making strides and making going in the right direction. Some time one piece isn’t working quite right and we lose,” said junior captain Shelbi Olson.
Although the game did not end in the Crimson’s favor, the Harvard offense shone. The bats were alive for Harvard, totaling nine hits, one shy of garnering its second double- digit tally of the season.
Unlike the game against Ball State where the Crimson posted 10 hits, sophomore infielder Emily Gusse was not the only player to blast an extra base hit, although she did hit her second home run of the season. This time the effort was very well balanced with three different Crimson bats, freshman infielder Haley Davis, junior infielder Kasey Lange and freshman outfielder Zoe Galindo all hitting doubles as well.
The Crimson also had a flawless day on the field, making no errors on the afternoon. The pitchers combined for only one strikeout, so the fielders had to be on their toes to make putouts when the ball was hit their way.
“We had really effective at bats,” Coach Jenny Allard said. “We really have grown defensively. We were scoring one or two runs an inning. [However] we weren’t effective on the mound.”
The Crimson pitchers, who have combined for a 4.11 ERA so far this season, were unable to match the opposing team in batting and fielding. Ruiz struggled, failing to make it out of the first inning on her way to giving up five earned runs. Reliever Jamie Hulula pitched three shutout innings before giving up two home runs in her fourth inning of work.
Freshman Morgan Groom was perhaps one bright spot on the day, making quick work of the four batters she faced.
The Crimson will have two more doubleheaders—one this weekend at Syracuse, and one next Tuesday in its home opener against Rhode Island—before the Ivy League campaign begins.
“Every year we are shooting for the Ivy League title,” said Olsen. “Those games are almost easier for use. Since every game is important we are always there mentally.”
With the improvements to its offense and fielding finally paying dividends, Harvard is excited to start its defense of the 2012 Ivy League title.
“Every year is different but we have a good core group still and we know what it takes to get there, and we have everything we need to get there,” continued Olsen.
This year’s group is beginning to hit stride at just the right time, feeling the positive effects of tough competition in California. However, they know that they must continue to improve and meld all facets of their game in order to succeed in Ivy League play.
“We know what it feels like for our pitchers to do well, we know what it feels like for out batters to do well,” said Allard. “We have had good outings at different times.  We just need [everything] to come together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, drawing the University of New Mexico in the NCAA tournament is a flashback his senior year of college. The national Defensive Player of the Year, Amaker was the lone starter returning from a Duke squad that made the tournament final in 1986. Back before Duke was Duke, with Blue Devil coach Mike Krzyzewski not yet the household name he would become, Amaker played a starring role for the 1987 Duke squad.
In the tournament, Duke easily advanced in its first two games, dispatching Texas A&M, 58-51, and Xavier, 65-60, to reach the Sweet Sixteen. There, awaiting Amaker and the Blue Devils, was current New Mexico coach and Indiana Hoosier guard Steve Alford. Alford had averaged 22 points a game for Bob Knight’s Hoosiers and would go on to lead the team to a national championship that year, topping Amaker’s squad, 88-82, in their clash.
“It was such a long time ago,” Amaker recalled. “You remember losing and it being the final game of your career and being in the locker room at season end as a senior. They were a great team. We had a great team the year before, but Indiana was great with Keith Smart, an amazing player who hit the big shot against Syracuse [in the 1987 national championship].”
Since then, Amaker and Alford have taken vastly differently paths to Salt Lake City, where their teams meet on Thursday night in a second-round matchup (9:50 EST, TNT). Disciples of their college coaches, both are branches of the Bob Knight coaching tree that liberally borrow for their mentor’s philosophies. Krzyzewski served as an assistant under Knight before moving to Duke, where in a few years he will threaten his former mentor’s all-time wins record.
Amaker’s Harvard team isn’t that different from Krzyzewski’s current Duke one. Both are dependent on outside guards with stretch fours (Ryan Kelly and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard) with offenses anchored by quick point guards (Siyani Chambers and Quinn Cook) and defenses dependent on shot-blocking big men (Kenyatta Smith and Mason Plumlee). Duke is famous for producing great three-point shooters—currently in the NBA, former Dukies Shane Battier, J.J. Reddick, and Kyle Singler all shoot 35 percent or better from behind the arc—a philosophy on which Amaker’s Harvard team, which is the seventh best shooting team in the country from behind the arc, is built on.
Alford’s New Mexico team emphasizes the toughness and defensive accountability that Knight was famous for; the former Indiana Mr. Basketball preaches his former coach’s motto: “Make more free throws than they take.” Alford’s team is sixth in the country in getting 25 percent of their points from free throws, and the Lobos rarely foul.
“You know coaches in terms of their styles,” Amaker said. “He is an Indiana native who is a man-to-man defensive guru. You know his background, and he was a great scorer and shooter as a player and he has always had guys who can do those things. His team is fundamentally sound and solid in every facet of the game. That’s how he played and that’s how he is as a coach. That’s why I think he’s done one of the more underrated coaching jobs in the country since he has come to New Mexico.”
Since their Sweet Sixteen matchup, Amaker and Alford have faced each other as coaches nine times. Coaching at the same time in the Big Ten, Alford got the better of Amaker five times while at Iowa, twice dispatching Amaker’s Michigan squads by more than 20 points. The matchups have brought the two close.
“I’ve known Steve forever,” Amaker said. “We were in the same class in high school. Steve is a good friend and a great player, and he has done a terrific job everywhere he has been as a coach. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Steve Alford. I don’t think he and I would have thought of this happening but we’ve been in the coaching profession enough to recognize this journey has been lucky enough to take us to being representatives of great schools. I’ve always admired Steve, and he was a great player and he’s become one of the best coaches around.”
Both coaches have taken their programs to new heights. For New Mexico, this is the third time in four years that the Lobos have received a top-five seed. In its last two NCAA appearances, New Mexico bowed out in the round of 32 to Washington and Louisville. Alford’s team is being touted as a Final Four sleeper, with its RPI rating and strength of schedule (second in the country according to one metric) indicative of what some consider an underseeded squad.
On the other side, Amaker has brought the Crimson to back-to-back NCAA tournaments and weathered the loss of four starters from a year ago, two to graduation and two to suspension. The Crimson has won a share of the past three Ivy League titles and made the AP Top 25 last year for the first time in program history.
Although he lost the last time the two played in the tournament, Amaker outshined Alford the last time the two shared the court as players. Alford was held to four points below his season average in that 1987 matchup, hounded into a six for 16 effort from the field. On the other side of the ball, Amaker led all scorers with 23 points and played all 40 minutes, shooting eight for 17.
Carrying an 11-point underdog into Thursday’s matchup, Amaker said that the Crimson must have faith into what got them to this point. If they do, revenge may be served.
“They have terrific balance and we should expect how well their fan base will travel to follow that program. That’s a proud program and it’ll be a tough environment and a tough opponent knowing what I know about Steve,” Amaker said. “We will tweak things based on scouting and our opponent but we need to remember who we are and what has gotten us to this point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—When Harvard junior co-captain Laurent Rivard takes the court Thursday evening at EnergySolutions Arena, he will be following in the footsteps of two of his countrymen.
Gonzaga forward Kelly Olynyk and guard Kevin Pangos—anchoring the Bulldogs offense with 17.5 and 11.5 points per game, respectively—will play earlier in the afternoon and join Rivard as two of the 27 Canadians that will participate in this year’s NCAA tournament.
Rivard—hailing from Quebec—is the only Crimson starter from up north, but freshmen teammates Agunwa Okolie and Patrick Steeves also call Canada home.
Although there are four fewer Canadians in the tournament this year compared to last year, many are poised to take bigger roles and make a larger impact. From Olynyk to Michigan guard Nik Stauskas, 21 of the Canadian nationals have earned awards for their regular season play.
“I would say we’re pushing each other,” said Pangos in Wednesday’s press conference. “The bar is set a lot higher. Guys aren’t satisfied with making the NCAA tournament anymore. Now the goal is to be in the NBA and the top NCAA teams.”
Rivard is no stranger to his Bulldog countrymen. Last summer the wing was named to the Canadian men’s National Team training camp roster, where he was joined by 12 other college basketball players—including Olynyk, Pangos and Stauskas—as well as members of NBA and other professional teams.
“We were almost rejuvenated with excitement going back to school with how much we learned,” Pangos said. “Everyone you could think of involved with Canada Basketball was there. Being around them, playing with the different styles of guards and things, it’s hard to soak it all in because there is so much you can learn there.”
Rivard’s relationship with Pangos and Olynyk dates back to 2009, when the three played on the Canadian Junior National Team, finishing seventh at the World Championships in New Zealand. At Wednesday’s press conference, Rivard talked about his experience playing in both the NCAA and in Canada.
“The progress that Canada has made in the past few years has been incredible,” Rivard said. “[Olynyk and Pangos are] good kids and really good basketball players, and I hope they do really well.”
Olynyk credited former Canadian players like Los Angeles Laker Steve Nash for paving the way. Nash—who represented Canada at the Olympics in 2000 and 2004—was named General Manager of the Canadian National Team last summer.
“Everybody is pushing each other and holding each other accountable, and we meet in the summer and reset our goals as a country and as individuals,” Pangos added. “It’s great to see, growing up with a lot of the guys that are on stage right now and seeing how basketball has transformed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—With every passing year of the Tommy Amaker era, it has become increasingly difficult for the Harvard men’s basketball team to accomplish a program first.
But on Thursday night, the 14th-seeded Crimson did just that when it shocked the third-seeded New Mexico Lobos—and the college basketball world—with a 68-62 win in the second round of the NCAA tournament.
“It’s unbelievable,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We’re still in disbelief, can’t believe it happened.... This is just as good as it gets.”
“This is the type of thing you dream about in your backyard,” said sophomore Wesley Saunders, who led the Crimson with 18 points. “For it to actually happen now is incredible.”
With its first playoff victory in program history—and its first-ever win over a team ranked in the Associated Press top 10—the Crimson became the lowest-seeded team to win a game thus far and set up a third-round matchup with No. 6 seed Arizona on Saturday.
“What a sensational, gutsy effort,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we had to play an exceptional basketball game against an outstanding team.”
New Mexico, the heavy favorite that finished the regular season ranked No. 1 in the RPI, rallied to take a one-point lead at 53-52 with 6:26 to go.
But the Crimson would not go away.
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard answered with a left corner three, Saunders rattled in a jumper with the shot clock winding down, and sophomore center Kenyatta Smith hit a lefty jump-hook over New Mexico center Alex Kirk to push the Harvard lead back to six.
The Lobos would not get within four the rest of the way.
“We just said we had to stick together and believe,” Saunders said. “They’re a great team, and we knew we couldn’t let down for a second.”
Harvard did not ease up, and after two Kendall Williams free throws cut the Crimson advantage to 64-60, Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers iced the game at the line.
With 18 seconds to go, Williams—the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year—missed a three and New Mexico grabbed the offensive rebound. But Saunders stole the ball and Harvard ran out the clock as the players and the hundreds of Crimson fans at the game erupted in joyous celebration.
“They had a lot of energy, a lot of focus, and they made tough shots,” Lobos coach Steve Alford said. “We just never could get in rhythm offensively...to really get a run and let our defense take over. We were just never able to do that.”
Harvard led throughout the first half and took a 31-27 lead into the break. But New Mexico scored the second half’s first six points to tie the game and then took its first lead at the 18:47 mark when Tony Snell went coast-to-coast for a layup.
But Harvard once again had an answer, as Webster and Rivard rattled in back-to-back threes and Chambers found Smith inside for a layup to put the Crimson back up six.
“I thought the composure that our kids displayed was terrific,” Amaker said. “We didn’t wilt or cave in.... I’m very, very proud of that.”
The teams went back and forth from there until Kirk’s layup with 6:26 to go put New Mexico up one. But Rivard’s fifth three gave the lead back to the Crimson, and Harvard—which had blown multiple late advantages against other tournament teams during the regular season—never looked back and slammed the door.
“[During the regular season], we had two or three losses at the end, and every time you learn and try to correct what you didn’t do well,” said Rivard, who scored 17 points and broke the Crimson single-season three-point record with his first long ball. “We showed more toughness than we did during the season to close out this game.”
Harvard survived despite the fact that its trio of undersized sophomore big men—Kenyatta Smith, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Jonah Travis—all picked up their fourth fouls late in the second half as the Lobos fed the paint over and over again.
“We found a little bit of success [inside],” Kirk said. “[But] they did a good job of doing what they could to stop us.”
The Crimson made 52.4 percent of its shots and saw four players—Rivard, Smith, Webster, and Saunders—score in double figures. Webster’s third point gave him 1,000 for his career.
Defensively, Harvard limited New Mexico to just 37.5 percent shooting from the floor and held the Lobos’ two best perimeter players—Williams and Snell—to just 5-of-18 shooting from the field.
“They struggled with making their shots, and I’m sure they were incredibly frustrated with that,” Amaker said. “But I like to think the way we locked in defensively...had something to do with it as well.”
Playing in front of 14,345 fans at EnergySolutions arena, Alford’s team came out ice cold, missing 11 of its first 12 attempts, including four straight missed threes. Harvard took advantage and raced out to a 9-2 lead.
But New Mexico then began to feed the post on nearly every possession and used a 14-5 run to tie the game as Smith was forced to sit with foul trouble.
After Harvard retook the lead, six straight points from Kirk got the Lobos within one with 4:37 remaining. But Harvard pushed the advantage back to six as Saunders hit a swooping layup and Webster drilled a left corner three. The teams then traded buckets the rest of the way, and the Crimson went into the break with the advantage.
In the second half, Harvard withstood the early New Mexico rally and became the 17th No. 14 seed all-time to win a first tournament game.
“[This] means the world to us,” Amaker said. “[It’s] a significant moment for us to be in this position.”
