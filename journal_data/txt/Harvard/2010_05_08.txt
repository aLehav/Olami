After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There will be a last stand.
With two out, two on, and the season on the line, it was a senior who came up with a clutch home run that propelled the Harvard softball team into a decisive third game in the Ivy League Championship Series.
The Crimson and Cornell split today’s games, forcing a rubber match that will take place tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm in Ithaca.
After losing the first game, 3-1, Harvard was down, 2-1, going into the bottom of the eighth in today’s nightcap. On a 2-2 count, sophomore Whitney Shaw grounded out to third base, adding a bit of pressure to the other hitters. Freshman Jessica Ferri was quickly struck out, leaving the Crimson with only one out left. But sophomore Mari Zumbro singled, kickstarting the offense and bringing up senior Jessica Pledger.
In what could have been her last at-bat in a Harvard uniform, Pledger belted out a single to third base that allowed Zumbro to advance to second. Senior Jen Francis followed with a home run to straightaway center to walk off with the 4-2 win.
As soon as the senior circled the bases, a huge mob was waiting to start the celebration. But it’s too early to really celebrate, with an Ivy title and a trip to the NCAA tournament at stake tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As his college years wind to a close and law school approaches, senior Ahn-Khoa Tran thought he had one last event left in his college athletics career. What better way to end than with a trip to Denver three weeks ago for the collegiate taekwondo nationals?
How about a trip to Spain for the World University Championships?
With his third place finish at nationals on Apr. 17-18, Tran earned an unexpected chance to represent the United States in Vigo, Spain this July.
“I’m thrilled,” he said. “This was going to be my last competition. I trained hard for nationals. Fighting at nationals is awesome.”
Tran, who first picked up the sport at age six, headed to Denver on a mission to improve upon his performance at nationals last year in Rhode Island, when he did not place. The senior upgraded his fitness regimen, partly in anticipation of Colorado’s higher altitude.
“I started training a lot more, started training earlier,” he said. “It’s a really cardio-intensive sport. It was a running every morning and training every night type deal. I was working out twice a day, six days a week.”
The efforts certainly showed through as the senior earned a third-place finish at nationals.
“We’re just all really proud of him,” added teammate Julie Shapiro. “All the hard work and training’s paid off.”
But despite his desire to improve, Tran said he never thought he’d be able to head to Spain, which usually requires a first-place finish. The second place finisher would have gone to Peru with the B team for the Pan-American Games.
“I didn’t give any thought [to Spain],” he said. “I wanted to medal. I wanted to get at least third. I didn’t think I was going to make the Spain team.”
But when the top two place winners turned down the A team, the door opened for Tran to participate in his first-ever international fighting. And all of a sudden, the senior has one more competition ahead of him.
“[Making the team] was kind of a big surprise and really exciting at the same time,” Tran said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After forcing a third game in the championship series, Harvard’s softball team fell to Cornell, 3-2, earlier today, giving the Big Red its fifth Ivy League title. Cornell took the first game, 3-1, but the Crimson posted a come-from-behind win on Friday to take game two, 4-2.
Harvard started the game on top after junior Ellen Macadam was driven home off an RBI single by freshman Jessica Ferri. The Big Red came back with a one-two punch in the third inning, when Erin Keene hit a single followed by a home run by Marissa Amiraian, building a 2-1 Cornell advantage.
The Crimson was able to even the playing field in the fourth inning with a solo shot from first baseman Whitney Shaw, but Amiraian struck again, sending a teammate home off of a bases-loaded single. The 3-2 score held for the remainder of the game, securing the Cornell victory and Ancient Eight title.
Despite the loss, Harvard still finished the season with its third Ivy League North Division title, boasting a conference record of 17-3. The softball team is graduating six seniors who nearly ended their Crimson careers the way they began it–with an Ivy League Championship.

You've just sat down in Lamont to start (and hopefully finish) that term  paper you've been putting off for months now. It's due tomorrow, but of  course you'll need to check your e-mail again...and again...and  again...
You finally resolve to start your paper after RSVPing via Facebook to a  dozen or so fashion shows. But where do you begin? Well, the Writing  Center went Web 2.0 to try to help you survive finals period: check out  the "'The Barker Underground' - the official [tumblr] blog of  the Harvard Writing Center."
In your case, we recommend checking out "The Nuclear Option: How to Write a Paper the Night  Before It’s Due." If you're having trouble with some of your  sources, breeze through "How to Critique an Author Who’s Smarter Than You."
Of course, you can also continue to procrastinate by reading interviews  with David Zarefsky and Matthew Kaiser. If you  really can't spare the time (come on!), the interviews are well worth  reading after you've finished (and slept away the pain).
