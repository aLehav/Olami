After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I walk through Harvard Yard to travel in between classes, I sometimes think about the large expanse of grass that the location is notable for: How many Harvard students has it felt treading on it as a shortcut when the paved paths get too full? How many generations of grass have persisted through the Cambridge snows? What has it seen?
Thinking about the memories of the things around me, I eventually start thinking about my own — the vignettes of a childhood that’s grown blurry around the edges: the colors the leaves used to turn in the neighborhoods I grew up in, my favorite days of elementary school. Growing up is a process of breaking and putting yourself back together with new pieces you find as you age.
Like the dramatic motions of tectonic plates, this process of breaking and coalescing into something newer is world-shaking — after all, you only experience childhood once. In putting yourself back together, what memories do you end up remembering, and which ones do you inadvertently discard? Can you even choose?
Though we cannot relive a particular memory or moment in time, being in a specific place can help us remember what we felt there, the fleeting moments we experienced. Physical spaces act as shadows of memory — not quite allowing us to relive specifics, but rather giving us fuzzy outlines of what was before. We cling to this as we get older, grappling with the paradox of experiencing new things while trying to remember old ones. Our memories, too, are colored by hindsight, dulling once-sunny days as we leave behind the rose-colored glasses of childhood.
The pandemic has completely redefined our relationships with physical spaces. Places that once seemed casual and inviting are now scented by the anxiety of catching a new variant; our eyes have learned to model the mechanics of respiratory spread in a confined room.
However, this redefinition can allow us to create a better post-pandemic world when we hopefully and finally see an end to our current viral circumstances. Improving shared spaces means shaping better experiences for the people that interact with them. From fixing inequity in access to greenspaces as a means to improving both pollution and health, to making spaces more accessible and attuned to the specific needs of people with disabilities, to eliminating hostile architecture, there is so much we can still do to make shared spaces more equitable for everyone who interacts with them.
We are in an era where so many venues of collective experience and memory have been forever changed — from shutdowns and reopenings of community centers to isolation from family during lockdowns to political instability. Many have also been touched by significant trauma. Experiencing individual grief is already difficult, so how does a nation — or the entire world — mourn?
Realigning ourselves to be more collectively compassionate, attuned to the needs of a larger community as opposed to solely individual-focused can allow for shared healing, an affirmation that despite the larger upheavals of living, we are still connected to one another. Centering and increasing shared spaces in a post-pandemic world could be a great place to start, in addition to improving already-existing community centers as a way to increase positive experiences and thus positive memories associated with that space.
Dear readers, in this last column piece, I leave you with a challenge: The next time you’re in a shared space, one filled with joy and hope, appreciate it in its entirety. The mental snapshot you take of that moment in time will decrease in clarity as time passes, but the value you found in that space — and similar shared spaces — need not.
As you walk through old hallways, think about the memories that are etched between the bricks, about how your added presence in the space contributes to its collective memory. Think about those who will come after you, and how that space can be made better for them. If spaces are shadows of memory, then may they invoke more joy than sorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democracy has failed. A second civil war is on the way. State secession is on the horizon. Well, maybe. At least a surprisingly sizable share of young Americans think so, according to the Institute of Politics Harvard Public Opinion Project’s Youth Poll. A staggering 52 percent of participants believe that the United States’ democracy has failed or is in trouble and, as bizarre as it is concerning, respondents on average report a 35 and 25 percent chance, respectively, that they will see a second civil war or a state secede in their lifetime. This lack of faith in our democracy and its stability among young adults is warranted; however, it is imperative that this vote of no confidence inspires even more engagement and activism, rather than despondency and disengagement.
Like many of the young adults who participated in this poll, we too have little to no faith in the U.S. democracy at large — not only because the U.S. was technically never a true democracy to begin with, but also due to the fact that our government is not truly representative and was not built to be. For one, our election system is structured such that the electoral college trumps the popular vote. Five times now, the popular vote has been denied by the electoral college: Many of us have seen this twice in our lifetimes. Not only is the popular vote devalued, but many populations have been, and continue to be, pushed and excluded from it. For more than a century of our nation’s rocky history, women and people of color were denied the vote. While amendments marked by varying degrees of success have been made in the past hundred years, the fact remains that we have inherited a broken system; one which was never designed, or even intended, to hear and represent all people — and the inflammatory residues of this marginalization are very much alive and blazing today.
America’s young adults see this, engendering the rightful deterioration of American exceptionalism among us and other young people; less than one-third of respondents believe that America is the greatest country in the world. Admittedly, we do take respondents’ anticipation of a looming civil war and state secession to be a bit extreme. But while we may not expect that a state will secede from the nation in our lifetimes, we are seriously concerned about how our politics will continue to function as polarization deepens and parties continue to operate on completely different sets of facts, moral values, and political understandings.
The good news, however, as leaders of the HPOP have mentioned, is that this lack of faith coincides with record rates of voter turnout and political activism among American youth. In the 2020 presidential election, 50 percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 — the same demographic sampled in this survey — headed to the polls (or the post office) for nearly a 30 percent increase from the 2016 election.
This trend is heartening, as these failings in our democracy should inspire more activism and political engagement among American youth, not less. As we have recently opined, the role of youth and student activism is paramount to a functioning democracy, especially in periods of political turmoil. As young people who believe our democracy is in danger, we must not become disengaged, but rather raise our voices even louder. Diagnosing the problem is the easy part; finding solutions is not.
Having a reliable and consistent temperature gauge to measure young Americans’ political opinions is imperative to this project of fixing our democracy: To that end, we thank those involved in the IOP’s Youth Poll, especially the students, for their efforts in helping to achieve this end. Providing information on young people’s opinions to policymakers, researchers, and the general public is a first step to making sure that they are heard. Even beyond that, we also value the thoughtful nature of the decisions made throughout the HPOP’s entire process: The choice to have the survey interviews conducted in English and Spanish, for example, is emblematic of the group’s particularly sensitive and careful approach.
Rather than guessing which state will be the first to secede, we must read the Youth Poll’s finding that young Americans share our lack of faith in the current U.S. democracy as a call to action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I begin this op-ed, I’m tempted to harangue Harvard for its burdensome academics, its cutthroat extracurriculars, perhaps its general ambiance of competitiveness, especially during final exams period. And while such a critique is warranted, I also tend to believe it’s rather useless.
I’m both an optimist and a pessimist. I’m the latter because I don’t have confidence that student complaints — whether person-to-person, via The Crimson, or perhaps in focus groups — go far in making change. In particular, I tend to get fatigued by pessimistic stances about Harvard’s complicity in the suffering of its students. This isn’t to say student suffering is overplayed. That is far from the truth. Many issues facing students are deeply harmful and require Harvard’s institutional intervention.
Nonetheless, when grievances are presented without overwhelmingly forceful (and simultaneously palatable) evidence, many complaints — especially those critiquing Harvard’s education system — tend to fall flat before the administration's eyes.
When it comes to some campus issues, then, I might consider myself a campus-libertarian of sorts. And in this way I’m optimistic. It’s true: Harvard hasn’t listened to us well.
But, if we want to transform our school’s culture, the power lies in the student body’s hands.
One issue to test this theory — about which I have unlimited complaints — is Harvard’s performative culture. Over a casual lunch conversation, a GroupMe thread, a late-night study session among Harvard students, one thing is clear: We’re overburdened by our school work and further stretched by our self-perpetuated, competing priorities amongst extracurriculars, relationships, and jobs.
As a result, Harvard is a place where, at least for me, much of what I learn in the classroom is superficial. It’s a place where students come to class having skimmed the book, but not read it deeply, because they’ve got a bajillion other things going on at the moment, and the reading assignment was probably too long, anyways. Nonetheless, it is our task to talk up the section as though we were experts on the topic. The fruit of this sort of conversation is increasing performativity, lots of “I agree” and lots of hidden fears about not knowing enough masked beneath robust vocabulary and classroom conversational skills.
For some, this is a sign that real, deep education is in decline. But for me, it means Harvard is doing exactly what it was meant to do: preparing us for the real world.
A Harvard degree is less about the knowledge one gains and more about the skill set and type of person it represents. An employer looking at a college graduate is less concerned about what they know than how quickly they can catch on, how well they can work in a team, and how fluidly they operate under pressure. So while our education over these four years — especially for those of us who just love to learn new things — often seems underwhelming and busy, the stress we experience, the resolve we build, and the priorities we learn to manage are marketable.
Harvard, then, is not the problem. It is merely a symptom of a broader culture of overburdened, passionately over-engaged, too socially active people. It’s doing a great job at what it was designed to do: producing the next generation of “citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” Deep learning can be found outside of the classroom: at parties, in dining halls, in late-night conversations about class content we fear would be censored by our own performativity.
Harvard’s performative culture — if measured by real-world preparation and effectiveness — is good. But what if you’re a dreamer and don’t want the real world?
In that case, it might be time for a revolution.

Researchers at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health found earlier this month that Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine is slightly more effective than Pfizer’s at preventing negative Covid-19 outcomes.
The researchers examined the health records of almost 440,000 U.S. veterans who received one of the two vaccines to directly compare their effectiveness. The study found that recipients of the Moderna vaccine were at slightly lower risk of five Covid-19 outcomes: documented infection, symptomatic Covid-19, hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death.
The study accounted for the changing phases of the pandemic by examining outcomes for one group that was vaccinated in early 2021 and another cohort that was vaccinated in mid-to-late 2021, when the Delta variant was spreading widely.
Barbra A. Dickerman, the lead author of the study and an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health, said both vaccines were found to be “remarkably effective” during early trials.
“Given the high effectiveness of both vaccines, either one is strongly recommended to any individual offered the choice between the two,” Dickerman wrote in an emailed statement.
“However, head-to-head comparisons of these vaccines had been lacking, leaving open the question of which vaccine was more effective,” she added.
According to Dickerman, the study’s large sample size allowed researchers to detect “subtle differences” between the two vaccines. The Moderna vaccine slightly more effective than the Pfizer across diverse groups of patients and for the Alpha and Delta strains of the virus, she noted.
The study found that individuals who received the Pfizer vaccine in early 2021, when the Alpha variant was spreading in the U.S., had a 27 percent higher risk of documented Covid-19 infection and a 70 percent higher risk of hospitalization compared to recipients of the Moderna vaccine. Risk of Covid-19 infection was also higher in the Pfizer group during the 12 weeks in which the Delta variant was predominant.
Although the differences between the vaccines in estimated risk is “small on the absolute scale,” Dickerman wrote that she believes this information may be useful as regulators decide how to deploy the vaccines on a large scale.
Dickerman also showed the importance of developing, maintaining, and using the sorts of large healthcare databases that provided the researchers with the high-quality data they needed for comparative analysis between the two vaccines.
“This study underscores the importance of continued investment in large integrated healthcare databases and experts in health data to generate timely, actionable evidence to inform decision-making when evidence from a randomized trial is not available to support it,” she wrote.
Dickerman added that researchers are also working to compare the relative safety of the vaccines.
“Any choice between vaccines must also consider their comparative safety, which was not studied here,” she wrote. “This is something that we are actively investigating.”

The emergence of the Omicron variant means that Harvard will “likely not be fully back to normal in the spring,” but the University remains in “very good shape” on the public health front, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said during a faculty meeting Tuesday.
In an interview with The Crimson last month, Garber said it was “a fairly safe bet” that Harvard would loosen Covid-19 restrictions in the spring semester, including potentially allowing lecturers and small groups to unmask indoors.
However, the discovery of the novel variant of Covid-19 — first detected by a Harvard-affiliated lab on Nov. 19 — means that “the shadow of Omicron is obviously with us,” according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay.
“We always knew the option to offer unmasked teaching would be contingent on public health conditions,” Gay said. “As always, we’ll be prepared to pivot to whatever conditions we confront in January.”
Garber stressed that while scientists are still working to understand the impact of the new strain, preliminary research suggests that Omicron “appears less severe.”
“You can be fairly confident in the belief that it is more contagious than previous variants,” Garber said. “We don’t have much data, but the data we have are reassuring that it causes less serious infections.”
At the meeting, Garber also urged faculty to obtain booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine, which he said could “help reduce severe transmission.” Despite the novel strain, Garber said the public health situation in the spring would likely improve.
“Travel is going to be a bit iffy, especially overseas,” he said. “We will likely not be fully back to normal in the spring. But I think we will continue, and spring will be better, rather than worse, than the fall.”
Harvard has only seen “perhaps” two hospitalizations due to Covid-19 among vaccinated affiliates out of roughly 1,200 breakthrough infections this year, according to Garber. Garber credited a low rate of spread on campus to “near vaccination of the entire community.”
“It is an extremely rare occurrence for a member of the Harvard community who is vaccinated to get sick enough to require hospitalization,” Garber said.
Reflecting on Harvard’s return to in-person operations, Garber also applauded the “extraordinary commitment of the Harvard community along so many dimensions.”
“I feel like I really need to call out the College, because when you think of what people were saying early on about the behavior of 18-to-24-year-olds, it is like our students were determined to prove the naysayers wrong,” he added.
Also at Tuesday’s faculty meeting, Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey presented the report of the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, which was released Monday.
“The task force was a testament to what we can do when we come together across boundaries within our institution to renew Harvard,” said Kelsey, who chaired the task force. “Ours is a time of reckoning — [a chance to examine] the stories our campus tells and does not tell, whom we honor and whom we forget, and how well we welcome new visitors to our campus.”
A new FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage, which Gay established in response to the task force’s recommendations, as well as a newly appointed FAS Campus Curator, will be tasked with implementing the committee’s suggestions.
“I believe this is a watershed moment for our campus as a place of learning and discovery,” Kelsey said.

UPDATED: December 8, 2021 at 4:00 p.m.
Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07 pledged $500 million over the next 15 years to found the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced Tuesday.
The University-wide institute, which will open at the Science and Engineering Complex in Allston by the end of 2022, will support 10 faculty appointments, computing equipment purchases, and other resources to help students at all levels at the University research both natural and artificial intelligence. It is named after Zuckerberg’s mother and grandparents, Karen, Sidney, and Gertrude Kempner, respectively.
Zuckerberg and Chan founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2015 to address social challenges through scientific research and philanthropy, according to the organization’s website. The couple has pledged to ultimately donate 99 percent of their Facebook equity to the CZI, which has made significant donations to Harvard in the past. In 2017, the CZI donated $12.1 million for public service initiatives at the College, followed by a $30 million donation in 2018 to support an early education program run by the Graduate School of Education.
The Institute will also emphasize diversity among its faculty and staff by “actively recruiting from underrepresented groups at every stage of the pipeline,” according to a press release from the CZI.
Sham M. Kakade, a University of Washington computer science professor who will join the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences next year, and Medical School neurobiology professor Bernardo L. Sabatini ’91 will head the institute as its new co-directors.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, Sabatini said the Institute’s goal is to better equip students and researchers through an interdisciplinary approach to the study of intelligence.
“There’s great expertise already at Harvard, and one goal is to bring that expertise together,” Sabatini told the Gazette. “Basically, we want this institute to be a destination: If you care about intelligence, whether it’s natural or artificial, you should want to come to this institute.”
In a statement published by the Gazette, University President Lawrence S. Bacow praised Chan and Zuckerberg for their financial support for and “genuine commitment” to research and development.
“Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to promoting discovery, innovation, and service at Harvard and other academic institutions around the United States,” Bacow said. “Their support for the creation of the Kempner Institute will advance Harvard’s education and research mission and is only the most recent way in which they have sought to do so.”
CORRECTION: December 8, 2021
A previous version of this headline and article misstated that the institute will be located at School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In fact, it will be a University-wide institute housed at the Science and Engineering Complex.

The Human Rights Working Group, an undergraduate group studying human rights, hosted an event celebrating Uyghur culture and calling for action on the current human rights abuses against the ethnic group on Monday evening.
Around 80 Harvard affiliates gathered in the Barker Center for the event, officially titled the Uyghur Culture Fest. The evening included catered Uyghur cuisine, dancing, and calligraphy as well as somber testimonials from those missing family members due to the current crisis.
Uyghurs are an ethnic and religious minority living in the Xinjiang region of China. Human rights groups allege that over 1 million Uyghurs have been held in “reeducation camps,” where they are subject to sterilization, forced labor, and other human rights abuses. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84, a former Crimson editorial editor, has accused the Chinese government of “genocide and crimes against humanity” in the current crisis.
Esedulla Uygur, a student at Harvard Divinity School, shared his family’s experience of abuse at the hands of the Chinese government. His father’s abduction led him to grapple with personal and academic challenges, he wrote in the piece, which was addressed to his mother.
“While I’m trying to write my papers, I question whether every piece I write will help me save you and my people from the oppression,” Uygur said. “It’s not easy to sit in the library and study while you, he, she, they, everyone in East Turkestan are struggling.”
Shayida Ali, a Uyghur immigrant who has lived in the Boston area since 2019, spoke about the difficulties she has faced since the abduction of her father and other family members. Because Ali studied abroad, her mother was forced to denounce their relationship to the government, she said.
“I want everyone to know all of these concentration camp victims are not just numbers. They have wonderful families. They had a happy life before that, and they deserve to have a good life again,” Ali said.
For Ali, a major challenge has been acting as a “happy, wonderful mom” to her newborn child in the U.S. while facing anxiety and “emotional challenges” following the disappearance of her relatives at home.
“How will this end? I always question myself living in the free world, how can we stop this?” Ali asked.
The evening also featured a presentation on Uyghur language and history and a poetry reading from Munawwar Abdulla, a lab manager in Harvard’s Department of Human and Evolutionary Biology.
In an interview prior to the event, Joshua Moriarty ’21-’22 said HRWG — which is sponsored by Harvard’s Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights — hopes that the celebration prompts attendees to engage with Uyghur culture and learn about the group’s ongoing struggles.
“We think that it’s critically important to engage with and to celebrate Uyghur culture now, because it’s being actively suppressed and even threatened with destruction in the Uyghur homeland,” Moriarty said.
Moriarty, who is an HRWG coordinator, said there has been “minor pushback” from those who disagree with the use of the term “genocide” to describe the treatment of the Uyghurs. Still, he said the event has generally been received with support on campus.
Organizers called on attendees to contact their representatives to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act, which would help Uyghurs seek refugee status, along with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would block imports of products made with forced labor.
The event raised nearly $600 for the Boston Uyghur School, a New England-based nonprofit founded in 2019 that aims to preserve Uyghur language and culture.
Rym El Mahil ’24, who attended the event, said the speeches were “heartbreaking” and served as a call to action.
“To hear firsthand the stories of people who are still undergoing this loss of family members, it was infuriating, it was incredibly saddening,” El Mahil said. “And it just makes me want to do what I can in any way possible.”

The Harvard Kennedy School reported a $1.5 million budget surplus during fiscal year 2021, which will enable the school to pursue cluster hires, expand its financial aid program, and invest in infrastructure, according to the school’s dean.
HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in an interview Tuesday that because of the surplus, HKS broke even over the past two years — an outcome he said was “much better” than the school had feared.
Per Elmendorf, the Kennedy School began several cluster hiring searches this year, including searches for faculty who study the environment, public management, and China’s geopolitical authority, respectively.
The use of cluster hiring is part of recent changes to the school’s hiring practices designed to improve diversity in the school’s faculty. Students have long called for HKS to strengthen its diversity and equity efforts.
“We found out that cluster hiring helps us to bring in a more diverse set of faculty members, and we intend to continue cluster searches where we can,” Elmendorf said.
Over the past few years, the school has hired approximately ten faculty members whose research focuses on the intersection of race and public policy. Elmendorf said the new hires are a “very substantial” and “appropriate” change to the school, noting that the school counts just over 100 faculty members.
“That doesn’t mean that we are done hiring people who work on race and public policy, but we feel pleased that we have been able to hire so many in the past few years,” Elmendorf said.
Elmendorf added that the school has reformed its faculty search practices to ensure that it casts a “wide net,” rather than “relying on personal networks” of current faculty, which he said gives rise to bias.
The budget surplus will also allow HKS to provide an additional $2 million per year for financial aid. The increase, however, falls short of student calls for full need-based financial aid, which Elmendorf said is not currently financially feasible.
Still, he argued making HKS financially accessible is a “top priority” of the school’s and reiterated the need for continued fundraising.
Elmendorf also said in Tuesday’s interview that HKS plans to invest in its physical and IT infrastructure. HKS will also pursue new online learning opportunities, which Elmendorf said will enable the school to expand its reach to students across the globe.
Elmendorf pointed to the school’s executive education programs – which were all held virtually since the start of the pandemic but will return to in-person programming this spring – as an example of the opportunities online learning can bring.
“We want to keep reaching people around the world the way that we did during the shutdown period,” Elmendorf said. “We’re going to try to build more online courses so that we can help public leaders wherever they are.”
During the interview, Elmendorf also addressed Michael Nutter’s recent appointment to chair the Institute of Politics’ Senior Advisory Committee.
The committee’s role in overseeing the Institute has become increasingly controversial. In February 2020, Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 – the last living child of former United States President John F. Kennedy ’40 – resigned from her post as honorary chair of the committee over concerns that Elmendorf and the Kennedy School were infringing on the autonomy of the advisory committee.
Despite Kennedy’s departure, Elmendorf said he speaks with her “fairly regularly,” and she was consulted about Nutter’s selection. He declined to provide specifics about their conversations.
An investigation by The Crimson in April found that Elmendorf has played a more active role in overseeing the IOP compared to his predecessors. While he declined to compare his level of engagement with previous deans, Elmendorf said he aims to ensure the IOP serves Harvard undergraduates “as effectively as possible.”
“It is so important that Harvard students have a chance to engage with politics and [be] drawn into public service,” Elmendorf said. “That’s part of my responsibility as dean and that's why I’m involved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the United States banned travel from several countries in southern Africa due to the emergence of a new coronavirus variant, Harvard undergraduates from the region lamented that they will not return home over winter recess for fear of not being able to return to campus.
Last month, scientists identified a new Covid-19 variant in South Africa named Omicron. In response, U.S. President Joe Biden enacted a ban on travel into the U.S. from eight countries in southern Africa — Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. The policy currently does not exempt students from those countries who attend American universities.
As a result, Zimbabwe native Jordan Mubako ’22 said he had to cancel his plans to return home over winter recess — which lasts approximately five weeks. Mubako said that quickly changing his travel plans was “very frustrating.”
Mubako has not visited home in more than two years. He said he has stayed on Harvard’s campus since fall 2019.
“There’s something a little bit sad about watching everyone go off at the end of the semester, go home to their families,” he said. “This place becomes a bit of a ghost town when everyone leaves.”
“I’d say I’ve given up on hopes of international travel until I graduate,” Mubako added.
Other students from southern Africa said they canceled their travel plans home because they do not want to risk being stranded abroad.
Colombe C. Obono Eyono ’25, who is from South Africa, said she has not finalized her winter recess plans but is “erring on the side of not going home.”
“The hardest part for me is probably just trying to figure out whether it’s worth it to go see my family,” she said. “I’m not sure whether or not there’ll be an exception made for international students by the time spring semester rolls around.”
The Harvard International Office urged international affiliates planning to travel over winter recess to monitor evolving travel restrictions.
“New public health requirements, including travel restrictions, can be added with very little advanced notice,” the office wrote in an email sent last week. “If you need to apply for a visa while abroad, be aware of the potential for limited consular appointments, possible delays in visa issuance, and potential appointment cancellations due to COVID-19 conditions in your home country.”
Matthew H. Andrews ’25 said he had hoped the travel ban would make exceptions for students studying in the U.S. on F-1 visas. But since the policy currently provides no such guarantee, Andrews said it is “very unlikely” he will fly home to South Africa during winter recess.
“It’s the uncertainty that is putting everyone through the most at the moment,” he said. “It’s an additional pressure on top of, obviously, what is normally a stressful final season.”
Andrews said he will likely spend the break at one of his roommates’ homes.
Lerato Takana ’22 has not visited his home in Lesotho in two years. Takana wrote in an email that he had already bought his tickets home and Christmas presents for his family but had to scratch his plans due to the ban.
Takana also wrote that he was “devastated” that he lost funding for a research project on farming in Lesotho that he and two other Harvard students had planned to conduct over winter recess.
“It has been helpful knowing that other African students will also be staying on-campus — we will console each other,” he added.
Takana also wrote that he is concerned his family will be unable to attend his graduation ceremony in the spring.
Obono Eyono said she is frustrated that the travel ban disproportionately affects students from Africa.
“For a disease that is global in nature, it feels more than just a bit unfair,” she said.

From the time David E.B. “Davey” Schoenberg ’20-’22 arrived on campus in 2016 until last week, he has only been able to eat one hot meal per day in Harvard’s dining halls.
Schoenberg is one of roughly 40 students on campus who keep kosher, following strict dietary restrictions according to Jewish law. Just one dining hall covered by Harvard’s undergraduate meal plan, Harvard Hillel, is kosher, and it is only open for dinner. Only cold kosher lunch options are provided under the meal plan.
Schoenberg and other students have spent years advocating for the College to expand its kosher lunch offerings, particularly to add hot lunch. That advocacy finally came to fruition Dec. 1, when Harvard University Dining Services launched a hot kosher lunch pilot in Quincy House, which students said they hope will be expanded.
Kosher-keeping students say they pay the full price of $7,236 for an unlimited meal plan, but only receive one-third of the hot meals non-kosher-keeping students do. Students may only opt out of Harvard’s meal plan if they live off campus or for medical reasons, not for religious reasons.
“The choice to make us stay on this meal plan was unkind in the seven or six semesters before this one where I didn’t have access to lunch,” Schoenberg said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard recognizes there is “always room for improvement in the support we offer to our students.”
“The College hopes to continue the work of engaging in dialogue with students to find ways to support them as we partner with HUDS in thinking about long-term solutions — in addition to short-term pilot programs like the kosher lunch program at Quincy House,” she wrote. “In addition, the Board of Religious, Spiritual and Ethical Life at the College has prioritized this issue (among others) as well, and is considering how their collaborative work can advance this issue.”
People who keep kosher must consume food that conforms to Jewish dietary regulations — known by the Hebrew word “kashrut” — which prohibit the mixing of meat and milk products and prescribe that animals be slaughtered according to kosher rules and that a supervisor called a mashgiach must oversee food preparation.
The dietary regulations also oppose kosher food mixing with non-kosher food or touching utensils that have touched non-kosher food. The food must also be properly and constantly supervised by a mashgiach to remain kosher.
Until the pilot launched last week, Harvard undergrads who keep kosher relied on lunch options such as dining hall “kosher corners” — fridges stocked with kosher food and a microwave meant to be used solely for kosher foods — or HUDS’s grab-and-go service, FlyBy.
“We have a kosher fridge, which is technically supposed to be stocked with kosher foods, but I’ve checked there — there’s really only tuna fish and frozen waffles, which I once tried to eat, but they were moldy,” said Sarah Bolnick ’23, a resident of Pforzheimer House.
Schoenberg added that the kosher microwaves are not locked, and he has seen students and dining hall staff use them to heat up non-kosher foods, which would make the microwaves no longer permissible to use with kosher food.
Students who have other dietary restrictions in addition to keeping kosher said they find it even more difficult to sustain themselves throughout the day, according to Abigail S. Huebner ’23, who is strictly gluten-free due to a health condition.
“It feels like you’re able to somewhat be one or the other at Harvard, but you can’t really be both because FlyBy was always sandwiches,” Huebner said. “I still generally either get fruit or sometimes yogurt from FlyBy, or I find things in the Hillel building. Or I just don’t eat lunch.”
Harvard Hillel Orthodox Rabbi Daniel “Dani” Passow recalled one vegetarian kosher-keeping student who lost 15 pounds due to a lack of access to kosher food.
One student — to whom The Crimson granted anonymity in order to discuss private health information — said they sought help from the Accessible Education Office due to their medical dietary restrictions in addition to keeping kosher.
The student said they felt the AEO discriminated against them because they keep kosher, alleging that the AEO officer told them they had to choose between keeping kosher and accommodating their medical restrictions.
The student said Harvard’s limited kosher options have led kosher-keeping students to a situation that is “functionally food insecurity,” with some resorting to hoarding food or rationing leftovers over a number of days.
Hillel tries to informally supplement food options by keeping leftovers from its events in a refrigerator, according to Executive Director Jonah C. Steinberg, though he acknowledged that doing so is “sub-optimal and even at times hazardous.”
“Availability of kosher food at lunchtime through HUDS has been a perennial challenge,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
Another issue kosher-keeping students raise is financial equity, noting that Harvard only allows students to opt out of its meal plan if they live off-campus or have medical dietary restrictions which HUDS cannot accommodate.
“I was like, fine, I give up, like, ‘You’re not feeding me, at least don’t make me pay,’” Schoenberg said. “They don’t care that if we have religious restrictions that they clearly can’t accommodate — that doesn’t enter into their picture and into what they factor in.”
Jacob M. Miller ’25 called the policy “unfair,” citing an existing option for off-campus students to buy variable meal plans of five, 10, or 21 meals per week, according to HUDS’s website.
“For people who do keep kosher, they’re only partaking in a fraction of the benefits of a full meal plan,” Miller said. “It seems unfair to mandate that we pay for the full meal plan when we’re not reaping the full benefits.”
Some students have even considered moving off-campus in order to access a partial meal plan.
“There are many people, including myself, who have considered moving off-campus, not because we’re not satisfied with our Houses, but because it would be cheaper — not just cheaper — we would eat better and be more satisfied living off-campus,” Schoenberg said. “This lack of food is pushing people to move off-campus and leave their House community.”
Accommodating the dietary restrictions of students who keep kosher is a controversy that goes back decades. Advocacy efforts picked up this past summer, however, when a group of four undergraduates — Schoenberg, Rebecca S. Araten ’22-’23, Matthew M. Jelen ’22, and Aviva L. F. Ramirez ’22-’23 — took up the cause.
Laura E. “Lori” Fein ’91, a former Crimson Editorial editor who serves on the board for Hillel, also played a crucial role in getting the Quincy pilot off the ground.
According to Fein, the four students asked her to help advocate for a hot lunch option.
Fein said she met with Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana, HUDS Managing Director Smitha S.H. Haneef, and Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 about the issue, though she credits Director of Residential Dining Operations Bruce Calvert for “cut[ting] to the chase” and launching the pilot.
“Finally, instead of having these large meetings with lots of people and lots of ideas and tons of wonderful goodwill, we had someone who could actually solve the problem, and within a week, suddenly there appeared a solution,” Fein said.
Jelen, who was involved in the recent efforts that secured the Quincy lunch, said he was “heartened” by productive meetings between HUDS and kosher-keeping students over the summer.
“I think a lot of that was the initiative of Managing Director Smitha Haneef who approached this job and saw the problem about kosher lunch and decided this was something she wanted to tackle,” Jelen said. “That was something that I think many other kosher students really appreciated.”
In an emailed statement, HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote that HUDS was “pleased” to have begun a “strong dialogue” with students over the summer.
“HUDS is committed to working in partnership with our kosher-keeping community to resolve issues and provide choices that create an inclusive dining [experience] while respecting and supporting the cultural, religious and dietary sensitivities of each person,” she wrote.
Nevertheless, Schoenberg said he was frustrated the burden fell on students to advocate for increased options.
“To some extent, it feels like Harvard is paying lip service to diversity and inclusion and doesn’t actually care about this inclusion — that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to have to advocate for myself to this extent,” he said.
Students gave the pilot’s opening days a mixed review, though most said the new program was a step in the right direction.
“It was chicken and some pasta with marinara sauce and some roasted zucchini,” Leah R. Baron ’25 said. “I thought it was perfectly fine.”
Bolnick said she was grateful for the hot lunch, but noted that choices remain limited.
“If you don’t like the one option — like I don’t know, some people don’t like white meat and at times it gets dried out especially if it’s prepared the night before, so it wasn’t the tastiest,” Bolnick said. “But it was something, so that was great.”
Kosher-keeping students still lack hot lunch on Sundays, when FlyBy is closed and the pilot is not running.
Fein said expanding kosher options will have impacts beyond the current student population.
“In terms of admissions and recruitment, the lack of a reasonable kosher option has hurt Harvard in the past and will continue to hurt Harvard,” Fein said, adding that Princeton, Columbia, and Penn have more “robust” kosher offerings.
“I do know many students who I was excited to invite to come to Harvard who simply said that they weren’t even applying,” she said.
Students said they would continue to push Harvard to expand its kosher offerings.
“The long-term hope remains of the buffet-style [lunch] at Harvard Hillel,” Schoenberg said. “I think that’s the best option.”
Fein proposed that the University orders lunch from a kosher caterer, similar to what Harvard did last year during the pandemic.
“Students who need to have a kosher lunch option should have something more than the exact same soggy egg salad or tuna salad sandwich, or turkey sandwich, day by day, week by week, month by month, for four straight years,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After lighting up Lavietes Pavilion for an impressive home victory last Tuesday over Merrimack College, Harvard women’s basketball (3-6) journeyed to Tempe, Ariz., last weekend to face two tough opponents in the Arizona State Classic. While the Crimson fell to the Rams of Colorado State (7-1) by a close score of 59-52, Harvard ran into a high-powered, athletic Arizona State Sun Devils (5-4) squad the following day, losing 91-54.
Harvard’s Saturday matchup with Colorado State was a tightly-contested affair throughout, with the Crimson enjoying a 28-25 lead at halftime and a 46-43 advantage entering the third quarter. Led by junior guard Maggie McCarthy’s 13 boards, Harvard outrebounded the Rams 54 to 37. The effort on the glass extended to the Crimson’s aggressive play on offense, as the team made it to the free throw line 15 times and converted at an 80 percent clip. Colorado State, however, capitalized on Harvard’s 1-for-21 field goal shooting in the fourth quarter to take the lead with five minutes remaining and win by seven points.
On Sunday, Pac-12 power Arizona State jumped out to a sizeable lead, finishing the first quarter with a 21-12 margin over Harvard. After only converting on one of its 11 field goal attempts in the second quarter, the Crimson entered halftime saddled with a 21-point deficit. The Sun Devils extended the lead further in the third and fourth quarters, finishing with a 37-point victory before the 1,500 fans in attendance at Desert Financial Arena.
Despite the pair of losses, the strong play of first-year guard Harmoni Turner provided a bright spot for the Crimson. Turner, a former five-star recruit heralded for her ball-handling and shot-making abilities, led Harvard in scoring in both games with 13 points against the Rams and 18 against the Sun Devils. Although she can continue to improve on her efficiency from the field (Turner shot a combined 32 percent in the two games), Coach Delaney-Smith has taken note of her growth, skill set, and adjustment to playing in a college basketball system.
“[Turner] is growing every [game], she gets better every time she gets on the floor,” Coach Delaney-Smith said. “I'm not sure that always shows in the analytics or in the stats necessarily. Her challenge was being in a system and running offenses and taking her skill set and using it within that system. And she's grown so much in that regard.”
When discussing her team’s performance this weekend, Coach Delaney-Smith noted the difficulty posed by Colorado State and Arizona State’s size, length, and athleticism. This problem especially presented itself against the Sun Devils, who outrebounded Harvard 61-18 and enjoyed a 25-8 margin on second-chance points.
“Both games [this weekend] were tough matchups,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were major underdogs today. Both [Colorado State and Arizona State] were very athletic. We took it on the chin today for sure. We were disappointed. We thought we should be able to put it together to split [the two games] this weekend. And we just were not able to.”
While the Crimson’s five-guard starting lineup of Turner, junior McKenzie Forbes, senior Tess Sussman, junior Maggie McCarthy, and sophomore Lola Mullaney has been able to compensate for their lack of a strong post presence with a high three-point shooting percentage, Harvard shot just a combined 4-for-48 (8 percent) from three during the weekend.
“We played really, really well against Colorado State. [We just] couldn't put the ball in the ocean, but it was a close ballgame [until] the last three minutes. We should have been able to win if we could have put the ball in the basket even a little teeny bit. It was [a] horrific shooting [performance] yesterday, and then today was not much better. We don't have an answer for why our shooting would be so good for two games and be so awful [this weekend]. I don't have an answer for that. I guess the players are gonna have to figure out what their answer is, but we could not put the ball in the ocean.”
Although the Crimson struggled on the court in Tempe, Coach Delaney-Smith came away from the trip excited for the next two weeks of competitive practices and physical recovery for her players. Given Harvard’s youth, these December practices will also be crucial for installing offensive and defensive sets before Ivy League play begins next month.
“We finally will have a stretch of practices where we can get some of our system that we want to get in defensively and offensively,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think those kids that need a break to get healthy and fix some of their limbs will be able to do that. And just the added experience of playing the game together — we'll do a lot of red-white games [intrasquad scrimmages], and I think that'll help us gain some much needed experience playing together. We're actually looking forward to this stretch of practices.”
As the Harvard student body gears up for its final exam period, which runs from Dec. 9-18, the women’s basketball team will similarly focus on ending the fall academic semester strong. Harvard will not face its next opponent, local rival Northeastern University (6-2), until Dec. 19.

We all love the holiday season! Whether it’s for the everpresent festive spirit or the unavoidable family drama with finals season thrown in somewhere, the end of November through January 1 has a special place in every heart. And during this time of emotional rollercoaster riding, who doesn’t turn to the wondrous escape of holiday snacking?! Enter Trader Joe’s winter items! Horrifically, I’ve somehow spent the last twenty years of my life without ever stepping foot into the magical, life changing grocer known to its familiars as TJ’s. So, this year as part of my season of self-growth, I decided to change the game. I threw on my backpack, jumped on my bike, and secured my mask. It was the day I would finally lose my Trader Joe’s virginity. All for the noble cause of reviewing some festive winter foods!
Cranberry Chevre: It’s good, but not as good as the blueberry addition 
As you know, before this adventure I’d never tripped to TJ’s, BUT I was lucky enough to have roommates who enabled me to enjoy the blueberry chevre. I must say, in comparison, the cranberry is yummy and is encrusted with crimson berries, but it’s just sooo sweet. The Harvard spirit in a cheese is great, and super sweet Harvard cheese in a salad might actually be delicious, but if you’re out here just trying to enjoy some stellar goat cheese, this might not be your first choice.
Rating: 6.5/10, would eat again probably 
Winter Wake-up Tea: Absolutely delicious
Loved! This tea is spicy and packed with flavor. Side note: Being of 100 percent Northern European descent, I likely found this tea extra ~spicy~. Anyway, this purchase was a win, and it’s worked its way into my daily routine. Not saying I’ve been able to transition away from a fat coffee before my 9 a.m’s, but this cinnamon tea definitely has me feeling cozy. Winter Wake-Up Tea for the win! Seriously, go buy some before finals suck out your will to live let alone your ability to wake up. And, for all you chemistry concentrators out there, I bet this would be the perfect addition to Gregg’s “Tea, Tucci, Tuesday, at Two” advising office hours!
Rating: 9/10, would definitely drink again 
Almond Nog: It’s very almondy 
If you’re going for a nog that’s both dairy free AND alcohol free (as I’m sure many of you are because if you’re a Harvard student under the age of 21, you obviously don’t drink), this is a solid choice. TJ’s almond nog has a good base of traditional spice flavors and a pretty thick consistency considering the almond milk base. The sipping experience was soothing, and I can imagine consuming this after a stress-packed exam or during a lively family holiday dinner might bring me some inner peace. My only criticism is that this almond nog is more almond tasting than other brands I’ve tried. Still would suggest this as a great addition to your next upcoming on-campus holiday gathering, but alas…
Rating: 7/10, a solid beverage choice 
Hot Chocolate Sticks: Most. Disappointing. By far. 
Honestly, I’m not sure how this product made it on the shelves. Idk if I’m incapable of reading directions (which I suspect isn’t the case), or if the directions apply to a thing that simply sucks, but I would not call the endgame of this adventure hot chocolate. I heated up some milk, stirred away with the “hot chocolate stick”, and waited for the clumpy mess in a mug to turn into a lovely winter drink. It did not, NOT, not even kind of happen. The taste wasn’t horrible at first—like shopping a required class you don’t want to take—but the more I drank, the less I wanted to be there. At least with those classes you know they’re going to rip out your soul. First-time TJer me, on the other hand, picked up the “hot chocolate sticks” expecting a gem... Now, I am only a husk of my former self :’(
Rating: 1/10, would passionately lobby for its removal from all TJ’s nationwide 
Candy Cane Joe-Joe’s: #1 Best Snack 
These beauties came in number one for most delicious snack from this selection of winter items. I’ve always been an avid supporter of the Oreo, but the Candy Cane Joe-Joe’s have stolen my heart. They are the perfect mix of chocolate sandwich cookie and pepperminty goodness. The cream filling contains little flecks of candy cane crunch, elevating the texture above that of the traditional Oreo. Even my roommate, who scrapes the filling out of her Oreos, thoroughly enjoyed the ENTIRE Candy Cane Joe-Joe experience. Whether you're looking to stress eat through reading period or your next family political debate, go get yourself a crimson-striped box and eat away your suffering!
Rating: 10/10, would marry?
Clearly, losing my Trader Joe’s virginity was a life changing experience. I have discovered both my passion for holiday Joe-Joe’s and my seething anger for hot chocolate sticks. Overall, I’d say I learned a lot about myself. Now that I’m at home in the middle of the North Carolina mountains where TJ’s is only a glittering memory of my past, I will treasure the moments we spent together, and I’m already counting down the days until we can be reunited<3. I truly don't know how I’m going to survive the holidays without all these snacks. Wow, panic is starting to set in as I type. I’ll just have to depend on our trusty Veritas to get me through.
