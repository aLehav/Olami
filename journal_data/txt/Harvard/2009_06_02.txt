After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, many students at Harvard watched as the financial crisis of last fall spiraled into one of the deepest recessions in living memory. But aside from the grim economic news, this past year has also brought with it a whole host of new international opportunities, controversies, and celebrations. The bleak state of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has been moderated to some extent, but new challenges for the United States and the world—including a resurgent Russia, a rising China, and economic turmoil all over the globe—put a great deal on the new Obama administration’s plate. Last August, we watched—along with much of the world—the spectacular Olympic ceremonies held in Beijing. While we remained concerned about the Chinese government’s human rights record and its occupation of Tibet, we did not find calls for a boycott of the opening or closing ceremonies to be justified. But the celebratory atmosphere of the Olympics was darkened by the South Ossetian conflict between Russia and Georgia, which reminded many observers all over the world of the potentially pernicious consequences of a resurgent Russia’s military and geopolitical clout.The new conflict in the post-Soviet sphere coincided with a period of relative stability in the heretofore bloody and violent war in Iraq, which we opposed from the start. But this calm was not to last.On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This sudden collapse marked the start of a financial chain reaction that reached across the oceans, bringing down parliamentary governments in Iceland and Latvia, and forcing the Hungarian and Ukrainian governments to appear hat-in-hand before the International Monetary Fund. We also watched—with some concern—as growth forecasts in several important emerging markets, like China, dipped for the first time in decades. We encouraged American and European policymakers to take aggressive action to forestall the crisis, and were supportive of the Bush Administration’s financial rescue plan.Around Thanksgiving, we were truly horrified by the brutal and vicious terrorist attacks in Mumbai. We urged the Indian government to take a moderate line towards Pakistan, expressed our hope that the United States would support the Indian government’s anti-terrorism initiatives, and sent our condolences to the people of Mumbai. And this was not the only sign of instability in South Asia; during the new calendar year, we were dismayed to hear of the Taliban’s resurgence in northwest Pakistan and called upon Washington to re-evaluate its aid strategy towards that troubled nation.While many Americans enjoyed a tranquil holiday season, the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip were not so lucky. When Israel launched its comprehensive assault on Hamas militants in Israel, we censured Tel Aviv for its overly aggressive response to recent rocket attacks on Israeli settlements, cities, and towns. The humanitarian disaster inflicted by Israel’s total blockade of the disputed territory was horrific, and we demanded that Israel relent on its hard-line policy against the ordinary people of Gaza. While Israel is right to seek to protect its people from indiscriminate rocket fire, its disproportionate response likely caused more harm than good.Meanwhile, Moscow rang in the New Year by shutting off gas supplies to Ukraine once again in a pricing dispute that has been heavily tinged by geopolitics. Eastern Europe, which has suffered heavily from the recent economic downturn, was further destabilized by this move. But the chilling news from Ukraine was offset by the announcement of a power-sharing agreement between the corrupt and ailing Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, led by Morgan Tsvangirai. President Mugabe, who was certified the winner of a questionably conducted election last fall, has presided over one of the greatest economic collapses in history, turning Zimbabwe—formerly a prosperous and stable region of Africa—into a poster child for economic mismanagement. We wished Prime Minister Tsvangirai the best of luck in helping to restore some semblance of peace and prosperity to that troubled country.In March, the International Criminal Court made history by issuing an arrest warrant for Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the President of Sudan. The Sudanese government has been complicit in what some American officials have called a genocide in the western parts of their state, especially Darfur. While it is unlikely that the ICC’s verdict will ever be carried out, it marked an important step forward in the evolution of international law, specifically relating to claims of human rights.Just after April Fools’ Day, North Korea launched perhaps its most ambitious rocketry project yet, which was intended to carry a satellite into orbit. Of course, this test was closely linked to the rogue state’s ballistic missile program, which, combined with its recently revealed nuclear deterrent, constitutes a definite threat to the stability of East Asia and much of the Pacific Rim. And in May, Pyongyang followed up by detonating yet another nuclear bomb. We praised the Obama administration’s reaction to the missile test, and hoped that its firm but measured stance would help the denuclearization process to move forward on the Korean Peninsula.As we turned in our term papers and began to prepare for our final exams, we learned of a massive outbreak of influenza in Mexico, dubbed “swine flu” by the American media. We were initially amused, but were also reminded of the importance of strong and effective public health measures to contain similar outbreaks. Luckily, the actual risk of becoming infected remained relatively low, and very few people lost their lives. And as our seniors prepared to don their caps for Commencement, those who hailed from overseas and abroad confronted one of the most challenging job markets in recent history, made even more difficult by the passage of counterproductive and protectionist legislation that limited the job prospects of those who hoped to go into the financial services industry after graduation.In retrospect, this past year has been a period of painful transition and much-needed change. With all of the numerous challenges that the Obama administration and the United States as a whole will face in the coming months, we hope that our nation, our institution, and the members of our graduating class can weather the storm and make their own mark on the world. We are pleased with the new administration’s foreign policy thus far, and hope that it continues to demonstrate a strong record of measured and rational decision-making.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to student life, good intentions are one thing, but good execution is another. This year saw the introduction of many new initiatives, among which were the green campus campaign, the Harvard Task Force on the Arts, the Report on Harvard Housing Renewal, and exciting plans for calendar changes. Students, however, benefit most when the administration follows through with its plans and takes student opinion into consideration. Likewise, efforts to improve social life at Harvard are much more likely to be successful if thoughtfully executed.By far, Harvard’s campaign to “green” the campus and raise awareness about environmental issues was a great success due to the efforts of both the administration and student environmental advocacy groups. Harvard kicked off the year with the creation of the Office of Sustainability and a weeklong sustainability celebration, headlined by guest speaker and former Vice-President Al Gore. Subsequently, the Harvard Environmental Action Committee’s extensive involvement in the Massachusetts General Court’s passage of a national energy policy resolution and the school’s selection of U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu for Commence speaker demonstrated the campus’s genuine commitment to greener living.In general, incorporation of student input led to positive results. HUDS in particular, went out of its way to solicit student feedback on many changes that it implemented this year. The modified reinstatement of calorie cards in the dining halls and the creation of a comprehensive website and Harvard dining blog demonstrated HUDS’s admirable responsiveness to student opinion. The Office of Career Services addressed criticisms that it focused too narrowly on the financial and consulting sectors by launching a new initiative to highlight more diverse career options. Although OCS still has room to improve, it is gratifying to see that it is beginning to branch out as more students look to alternative career options. The Q Guide also made a very sensible change this year by finally requiring students to complete their evaluations in order to view their grades promptly after examination period. Again, encouraging student participation is key to making the Q Guide effective, but further improvements such as creating a more accurate rating system and better integrating the Q Guide with the my.harvard.edu course shopping tool are necessary for the Q Guide to be truly useful for students.At several points in the year, University Hall raised ire among the student body by putting forth good ideas and then failing to back them up. Just months after President Drew G. Faust announced the formation of the Harvard Task Force on the Arts, VES students were dismayed to find out that instead of increasing the number course offerings in visual art, Harvard would be letting one of its two painting teachers on the VES faculty, Nancy Mitchnick, to leave when her visiting lecturer contract expires with no plans announced to replace her.Similar indignation greeted the letter sent out this spring by Deans Michael A. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds announcing that, instead of creating the much anticipated “January Experience” programming for the extended free period created by the calendar change next year, the university will close the campus for the full five weeks. While the extra discretionary time may be positive for overstressed and overcommitted Harvard students, we are concerned that housing on campus will only be made available to a limited number of students “having good reason” to stay on campus. The arrested development of January programming may have been a reasonable decision given the current state of FAS finances, but the disorganized manner in which administrators handled this decision and their lack of transparency with students suggested that calendar reform was not well thought-out.Of course, Harvard’s budget cuts have affected every aspect of the University, and student life was no exception. Even though student opinion should by no means dictate budgeting decisions, the University should have consulted with students before making any final decisions. For example, the administration should have solicited feedback from student athletes before cutting hot breakfast and feedback from Quadlings before closing the Quad Library or reducing Quad shuttle service. It is unacceptable that these students should be forced to choose between participating in student nightlife by the river and getting home safely. Fortunately, the issue of shuttle transportation will be reconsidered this summer.The Houses also took a hit during this time of institutional belt-tightening, with each House required to slash 25 percent of its budget for next year. In a perplexing sequence of events, the announcement about House budget cuts came on the heels of the recently released Report on Harvard House Renewal. Once again, students were temporarily encouraged by the fact that the report addressed many long-standing student concerns such as creating more House social space and eliminating walkthroughs. With a 25 percent budget reduction though, it is unclear whether non-construction-related recommendations that could be addressed now, such as increased tutor presence and restructuring of Senior Common Rooms, will be completed. Budget cuts are unavoidable at this point in time, but hopefully extras like food at House events will be eliminated rather than the House administrative staff that provides vital student services.The eternal quest to improve College social life enjoyed general success this year, with a few big exceptions. September saw the announcement of a new financial initiative in which the College allocated an additional $75,000 to facilitate student group transportation and house formals. Then the College responded to student outcry over its new alcohol policy by revising the objectionable provision that held student group leaders responsible for individuals who become intoxicated during their social events. Students were generally pleased to see sensible proposals get translated into sensible policies within a reasonable amount of time.The UC deserves credit for forging a better relationship with the Dean of the College this year, one that helped facilitate positive developments like the provisional return of a modified version of the Party Fund, which was unceremoniously terminated last year. The new “UC Weekend Fund,” created under the Social Grants act, does not allocate money for private room parties as the Party Fund did, but some form of social event funding is better than having none at all.  This was a sensible move for the UC and should help revitalize the Harvard party scene.Unfortunately, good intentions got the better of the UC with regard to increasing campus social space. Lack of social space is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed, but the UC’s planned purchase of the 45 Mt. Auburn Street property is an unfeasible and ultimately counterproductive goal. Raising the approximately $6 million needed for the initial purchase over the course of a 16 month capital campaign to solicit alumni donations is highly unrealistic, especially in this difficult financial climate. Moreover, if the UC actually does manage to acquire the building, it will require extensive renovation in order to be usable, and the small size of the building itself suggests that it will not be the type of student center that students envision. This misguided attempt to address the social space issue will only hurt the UC’s credibility and detract from more pressing issues such as responding to the budget cuts.Yet there are always lessons to be learned from mistakes. Students were pleased with the CEB’s choice for Pep Rally artist this year, popular DJ Girl Talk, but a combination of poor planning, a dangerously flimsy stage, and an unusually high student turnout prompted HUPD to prematurely cancel the concert. Fortunately, the CEB was able to redeem itself for its botched execution of the Girl Talk event by putting on an impressive Yardfest concert this spring. The CEB deserved praise for picking up-and-coming artists this year, Sarah Bareilles and Ratatat, and taking the time to poll students about their preferences.Obviously, with the financial issues the University is currently grappling with, this year has been a particularly tough one for carrying out even the best-laid plans. There is no shortage of creative ideas on campus for dealing with everything from budget cuts to student social life, but open communication and concrete plans go a long way toward smoothing relations between students and administrators as those ideas become realities. For real improvements to student life, it’s not just the thought that counts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CNN and other around-the-clock political news stations definitely had their hands full this year. Along with the election of the nation’s first African-American president came many other important political controversies and watershed moments. In the year of change, we supported expanding freedoms in areas such as stem cell research and homosexual rights. We asked for more accountability among elected officials and backed a large stimulus to help jumpstart our economy. Most importantly, we believed—and still do—that Barack Obama was the correct choice for the 44th President of the United States.This year was one of scandals. It was disgraceful how many of Obama’s appointees had their nominations stalled due to tax problems, and how so many elected officials believed they were exempt from the law. Just like regular citizens, politicians should be required to obey tax codes. Moreover, the timing of many of the scandals was truly unfortunate. There should be higher levels of scrutiny in place and more tax records demanded from high level public officials to identify corruption earlier than in confirmation hearings.One politician who was truly unfaithful to his electorate was former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich’s decision to sell then-Senator Obama’s seat was despicable, and equally upsetting was his installation of Senator Roland Burris as the junior senator from Illinois. Blagojevich should not have been given such power after his unlawful actions, and the circus that ensued afterward was truly an abomination. The appointment of a new senator should have been made fairly and lawfully, and, most importantly, not by a person who was indicted on corruption charges and soon thereafter impeached. While we demanded more accountability among elected officials, we asked for more freedom for all Americans. This year could have been an important one in terms of securing the right to marriage for gay couples, with according referenda on the ballot in several states. Unfortunately, special interest groups had such an influence that the majority of people in those states voted to deny rights to a significant minority. We were strongly against Prop 8 in California and its equivalent in other states; now, we hope that these referenda will be overturned in the future, for these couples deserve the opportunity to marry. Another area in which homosexuals are continually denied rights is the United States army. This year, there was a great amount of attention paid to the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. Though we supported the University making it easier for ROTC students to cross-register at MIT, allowing military science courses to appear on transcripts, and improving the financial aid policy so that ROTC grants do not preclude students from receiving Harvard funds, we remained firmly opposed to the national “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” program. We support Harvard’s refusal to officially recognize ROTC, just as it would refuse to recognize any other organization that denied membership to applicants who are openly homosexual, but we hope that President Obama and Congress will overturn DADT in the near future so that ROTC can have a place on Harvard’s campus.Another hot topic in national politics this year was stem cell research. Under President Bush, the religious beliefs of a sector of the population had too great of an impact on scientific policy. Under Obama’s administration and with the backing of the current Congress, embryonic stem cell research is permitted to be publicly funded once more—a decision we wholeheartedly applauded. We see enormous potential for a more amenable government view of stem cell research and are steadfast in the belief that using stem cells will help us find cures for a broad range of diseases. Moreover, we encouraged Congress to go even further and spend more money on science. When President Faust and other members of the Massachusetts Life Science Collective urged Congress in January to increase federal funding for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other scientific research agencies, they were correct in asserting how important it is to increase spending on science even when cutting spending in other areas due to the economic crisis. We were delighted when the House of Representatives approved billions of dollars in funding to be spent on scientific research, and hope that the trend toward increasing research will continue. Not only will such research save lives, but it will also provide jobs, spur the economy, and maintain America’s competitive edge in the global community.Overshadowing all other opportunities for substantial progress this year was the financial crisis. Reviving the economy through government spending on education, infrastructure, and healthcare, along with tax cuts, rebates, and unemployment benefits was necessary. Though we were happy that Obama’s stimulus package passed the House of Representatives anyway, we were disappointed that not one of the House’s 177 Republicans voted yes on it.Though much happened in national politics outside of the presidency, the most exciting moment of the year was the election of President Barack Obama. Strikingly different when compared with the Bush administration, Obama’s respect for intelligence and encouragement of change are what we asked for in our leader. We chose Obama after weighing heavily his concerns versus those of his opponents. We believed—and still do—that Obama’s plans to address the economy, health care, energy, foreign policy, education, and more are all improvements for a broken system. We were encouraged by Obama’s response to our nation’s economic meltdown, and believed that his ideas for a stimulus were simultaneously pragmatic and beneficial. In a world plagued by threats of terrorism and war, Obama brings to the table a diplomatic approach that we wish more leaders would employ. The theme of Obama’s campaign was “change” and, indeed, there have been many recent changes to the political landscape, most of which are positive. As our politicians continue to legislate, however, we hope that they will become increasingly accountable and work harder to ensure that all Americans have equal opportunities.

At the start of the 2008-2009 school year, the financial picture still looked rosy for Harvard students. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’ recent funding initiative for undergraduates was welcomed by the student body, and hints of budget cuts were still far off on the horizon. Economists noted that college towns and campuses are often the most insulated areas during tough economic climates, but it did not take long for the Wall Street meltdown to make its presence felt at Harvard. In early December, President Drew G. Faust wrote an email to the Harvard community hinting at the University’s financial woes. The revealed endowment loss was large, a full 22 percent down. With no major cuts yet made, we declared our preparedness for hard times. With so much potentially on the cutting block, we conceded that cuts to student life may be necessary to maintain our academic culture.     Soon though, it became apparent that small cutbacks to House barbeques and formals were not going to be the end of the cutbacks. February brought on the announcement of a major delay of the Harvard-Allston construction, an unfortunate move that will only delay Harvard’s science and research, and worsen already strained relations with Allston neighbors. We are mindful of the financial challenges and mental stress that this situation is placing on Harvard’s administrators, but as Boston Mayor Thomas Menino pointed out in a letter to Faust, we have to push forward and keep our promises to Harvard’s students and the Allston community.       Current students were also hit with a late-winter announcements of a tuition increase. This, however troubling for families that already struggle with the term bill, was still something that must take place for academic goals to be preserved. This mixing of goals was also apparent in the extending of Harvard’s temporary ban on transfer applicants, when lack of adequate housing ruled out the chance to accept students from a very valuable pool. After all, along with the tuition hike came increased financial aid, one area of University spending that we believe should be prioritized above all else, and thankfully continues to that students from all different backgrounds can attend Harvard.       No matter what type of life Harvard students are coming from, their health must be supported. This year proved that Harvard University Health services are capable of both handling a crisis well, but also cutting back on necessary services. UHS handled the Swine Flu scare adequately with constant notifications and small steps to prevent infection. It wasn’t so adept at handling sexual health, however, as Harvard ended of anonymous HIV testing program. In a peculiar move the University moved backwards in its support of sexual health and awareness. The question of recognition for the Harvard Reserve Officers Training Corps also worked its way into the conversation this year. University policy still states that as long as the U.S. military continues to discriminate against homosexuals with its “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, Harvard will not reinstate the organization, the right response to an explicitly exclusionary rule. However, the sacrifice these Harvard cadets make is still sincerely appreciated, and Harvard should take simple measures short of official recognition to help support these students.       The scope of cuts to the Harvard Budget continued to widen when announcements of cuts to staff, such as custodians and janitors, were made. While this move generated protests and rallies directed by the Student Labor Action Movement, and even a critical letter from the Cambridge City Council, since the University’s first priority must remain the education and research it can generate, these cuts were unfortunate, but necessary, evils.            More troublingly, this crisis revealed a general lack of transparency in University finances. This problem was somewhat mitigated by the “town hall meetings” hosted by FAS Dean Michael Smith, but these clarification sessions were not sufficient. Harvard needs to be more open about its financial situation so that its plans can be critically evaluated.  Although knowing that student life, staff job security, and the possibility of and J-Term were all dwindling was troubling enough, as the months wore on it became clear that the quality of education was no longer safe either. Effects of the budget problems started at the top with the Faculty, with the option of early retirements being offered to older professors in an effort to save money. While some benefit exists in younger faculty being given more responsibility and power in Harvard’s vast departments the faculty buyout further strains the school’s academic offerings, cutting into its core mission. This is especially problematic given that the early retirement plan came along with dramatically reduced hiring of new faculty.           The cuts and policy decisions that have been made so far have been heavy, and more will be arriving in the fall. Beyond token town hall meetings, more student input must be taken into account when cuts to student life and services are made in the future. In addition, having expanded dramatically over the last ten years, Harvard’s central administration—the very people that are deciding the school’s financial future—must be willing to make cuts to their own bureaucracy along with everything else. This process will not be enjoyable, and life at Harvard will be dramatically different, but our priorities of education and safety must be the guiding factors, no matter who is calling the shots.

We will create life from inanimate compounds, and we will find life in space. But the life that should more immediately interest us lies between these extremes, in the middle range we all inhabit between our genes and our stars. It is the thin bleeding line within the thin blue line, the anthroposphere within the biosphere, the part of the material world in which we live out our lives. It is ourselves.For we are rapidly and inexorably changing. I do not mean that our numbers are exploding – a topic that has been attracting attention since Malthus. Nor do I mean that life expectancy is rising – a fact that is widely appreciated. I mean a very modern and massive set of changes in the composition of the human population.Changes in four aspects of population structure are key: (1) sex ratio, (2) age structure, (3) kinship systems, and (4) income distribution. Sex ratios are becoming increasingly unbalanced in many parts of the world, especially in China and India (which account for 37 percent of the global population). The normal sex ratio at birth is roughly 106 males for every 100 females, but it may presently be as high as 120 for young people in China, or as high as 111 in India.  This shift may arise from preferential abortion or the neglect of baby girls relative to boys. Gender imbalance may also have other determinants, such as large-scale migration of one or the other sex in search of work. This shift has numerous implications. For example, given the historical role of females as caregivers to elderly parents, a shortage of women to fill this role will induce large-scale social adjustments. Moreover, an excess of low-status men unable to find wives results in an easy (and large) pool of recruits for extremism and violence. This shift in gender ratios may have other, less heralded implications, however. Some of our own work has suggested that this shift may actually shorten men’s lives, reversing some of the historic progress our species has made in recent centuries. Across a range of species, skewed sex ratios result in intensified competition for sexual partners and this induces stress for the supernumerary sex. In humans, it seems, a 5 percent excess of males at the time of sexual maturity shortens the survival of men by about three months in late life, which is a very substantial loss.On the other hand, the population worldwide is getting older, especially in the developed world. Globally, the UN estimates that the proportion of people aged 60 and over will double between 2000 and 2050, from 10 percent to 21 percent, and the proportion of children will drop from 30 percent to 21 percent. This change also has numerous implications, including for the “dependency ratio,” meaning that fewer young people are available to provide for the medical and economic needs of the elderly. Much less heralded, however, is the fact that war is a young person’s activity, and it is entirely likely that, as populations age, they may become less aggressive. The changing nature of kinship networks, such as the growth in blended families – whether due to changing divorce patterns in the developed world or AIDS killing off parents in Africa – also has implications for the network of obligations and entitlements within families. Changing kinship systems in modern American society (with complex mixtures of remarried and cohabiting couples, half-siblings, step-siblings, and so on) are having profound implications for care giving, retirement, and bequests. Who cares for Grandma? Who gets her money when she dies? One recent study of a random sample of Americans found that step-parents were not seen as family members when it came to traditional norms of helping with respect to health care needs. People face all kinds of conundrums, many of which are manifest during everyday clinical care. There is the woman whose elderly mother remarries a man without children. If her mother dies before the man, will she be expected to take care of this man she barely knows? There is the man who does not know what amount of grief is appropriate when his step-sibling, who he met when he was 14, dies when they are both adults. There are the squabbling half-siblings, arguing about their standing to decide on life-support withdrawal for their parent.Finally, it is not just the balance between males and females, or young and old, that is changing, but also the balance between rich and poor. Income inequality is reaching historic heights throughout the world. The top 1 percent of the people in the world receive 57 percent of the income. Income inequality in the US is presently at its highest recorded levels, exceeding even the Roaring Twenties. And while economic development in China has proceeded with astonishing rapidity, income is not evenly distributed; the prospects for conflict in that country as a result seem very high in the coming decades. These forces may increase the propensity to violence and mental illness, and perhaps even poor physical health, judging from a string of intriguing studies of the impact of income inequality on health. Lacking any real predators, a key feature of the human environment is other humans. In our rush to focus on admittedly substantial threats such as global warming and environmental degradation, we should not overlook this fact. It is well to look around at whom, and not just what, surrounds us. Population structure will change everything. Our health, wealth, and peace depend on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council has never been the most popular organization on campus. As president, it is hard to deny that most students view the UC with suspicion and doubt, for the council has often appeared more self-important than productive. But as the elected student government, the UC has always held a great deal of potential. Created by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the UC’s responsibility is to advocate for students in a complex and decentralized Harvard administration. Even though the mission of the council is straightforward, it has never been easily accomplished. The UC has become a whipping post for students frustrated by the lack of student input in college and university wide decisions. While fingers often point to a hyper-political council or an opaque administration, the council will continue to fall short of its potential until students choose to empower the UC once again.This semester, the UC took a series of steps to reconnect with the student body. With a new communications committee, we have spent a semester trying to inform students about how we work, and how they can get involved. Students came together to improve UC funding, provide new student services, work towards an ethnic studies secondary field, advocate for student social space, and protest budget cuts. When it was announced that the campus would close for five weeks in January next year, we had over 100 students ask how they could respond or change the decision. When the UC explored the possibility of fundraising for a student center, students came to the general meeting and debated passionately for two hours for and against the proposal. When students became involved in these issues, UC members became better representatives. They could actively point to the opinions of the students who had elected them, and our council debates became longer and more nuanced as we began to consider the opinions of people outside of the room. The UC membership naturally expanded and evolved from a self-selecting governing body to a more inclusive group of concerned students.While the UC has taken important measures to create a more inclusive council, there is still work to be done. The UC is too often defined by the personalities that lead it, and over the years, a select few have dominated the council agenda and discussion. As president, I will continue to push the UC beyond its history, and make council operations and advocacy accessible to any student that is concerned about student life. You should never have to be a UC insider to work for students, and I remain committed to the vision of an inclusive and accessible UC. This semester, the council passed major constitutional reforms to remove our own bureaucratic barriers. The new reforms will improve communication, management, and efficiency within the council, but the UC will only reach its full potential by bringing students back into the process.The UC has always been what students make it. Initiatives like calendar reform would never have been possible without the help of students, nor would academic changes like ethnic studies be realized without a coalition of students supporting it. No government can function without an active constituency, and the successes and failures of UC initiatives most often reflect the numbers of non-UC members supporting them. Whether it is participating in a UC meeting, serving on a student-faculty committee, or writing to your UC representative, the UC will only continue to improve if we hear from the people we represent. On May 19, 150 students joined together to rally against the exclusion of student opinion in the first round of budget cuts. Leading up to the rally, students submitted over 70 pages of feedback on the budget process to the UC website. This input will guide the UC leadership over the summer, and has allowed the UC to gain a better grasp on student opinion. However, students must not lose interest in the budget process—for as Harvard reshapes and restructures, student opinion must be heard. We must build on the energy from the rally, and while it is the UC’s job to provide students the forums and opportunities to get involved, these efforts will not succeed unless we have students willing to participate. The UC cannot respond to the budget crisis alone, and I hope that in the next semester students will continue to join forces with the UC and the administration in the tenuous process of cutting back.In the next year, the UC needs more student support than ever before. We need students to push for more involvement in the budget process, we need students to call for reforms to the Ad Board, and we need students to work with us to give student voice a permanent and substantive role in the College’s decision-making processes. There is no greater time to get involved with student government than the greatest budget crisis in Harvard’s history, and there is no greater time to show the administration that students are ready to increase their involvement in the College. As the UC sheds its old ways, it still has the opportunity to be an active voice for students, but even as we evolve as a council, we will only be effective if students are prepared to get involved and work for the issues that matter the most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It isn’t easy to keep the faith these days. If pollsters are to be trusted, the number of regular worshippers has been descending steadily Hades-ward over the past few decades. A magazine exists promisingly titled The Believer, but it’s more packed with soft-pedaled literary snark than glory-be’s. And sure, there’s a Bible Belt, but its extensive coverage by the liberal media has a lot to do with the fact that it just seems so darn quaint. It’s enough to make those folk so inclined throw up their hands and pray for proof of the Big Man’s existence, if He isn’t too busy running after all those renegade apostates.
Well, maybe the situation isn’t as dire as it’s made out to be. Belief hasn’t gone entirely to the dogs. One might even say, with only a little exaggeration, that the primary thing that characterizes our age is its necessity for faith—not in any Christian deity or even the almighty Mammon, but in the boundlessly optimistic idea that everything will make sense in the end. There’s enough gritty frontier fiber left in the national spirit for us to remain positive that everything will ultimately be okay. Recent events have done much to shake up that can-do conviction—but for now, precariously, it still holds.Part of this has to do with Obama, who came like a healing balm to soothe our collective hurt. Entering from stage left, the secular savior trounced a “maverick” opposition with his calming rhetoric and confident stoicism. His most celebrated campaign poster Photoshopped him down to a few clean strokes and the reassuring hues of red, white, and blue; beneath his portrait, in bold block letters, was inscribed a single word—“HOPE.” It was simple, but it was enough. That one word, transmitted across the nation from person to person as current through a wire, galvanized the masses into elevating a young senator from Illinois to the swankiest digs in the Oval Office.
Those soft currents of hope, though, concealed a hard desperation. After the drunken revelry and reggaeton music celebrating his election had toned down and turned off, a long, sober, reflective period set in. What was Obama’s plan for the next 100 days? What exactly had his platform ever been anyway? As the new president and the nation shifted their feet, unemployment rates continued to spiral smokily upward—6.7 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.6 percent, 8.1 percent—foreshadowing imminent conflagration.
The magic potion that Obama and his advisers finally conjured up to ward off collapse was an enormous stimulus package, including under its vast umbrella everything from infrastructure to the creation of “green” jobs. Its very immensity required some of the same good ol’ American optimism that had won Obama his mandarin’s perch. Flood the economy with enough money, the premise went, and we can all float our little rafts to the golden shores of prosperity. But despite the plan’s elephantine nature—and its bizarre twist on trickle-down—Democrats had a tough time selling it to Republicans. Not everyone was as willing to take it on trust; one Republican senator even dismissed the bill as a “stinking, bloated, quivering pile of liberal pork.” The Dems finally managed to slam it through the House with nary a GOP vote, and through the Senate with only three: hardly a bipartisan victory.
The jury’s still out as to its success, and, frankly, the forecast remains bleak. Despite that, the number of doomsayers has remained surprisingly limited. It’s true that nobody really knows what’s going on anymore: mysterious back-door finagling involving securitized mortgages and credit default swaps somehow resulted in frail old grandmothers thrown out of their Orlando condos; money managers walking into their own clever booby traps ended up in the red and out of work. The stimulus package, our best option, seemed more of a quick-fix to placate the masses—like those one-size-fits-all T-shirts doled out to the summer camp brat pack—than a sensitive economic instrument. But that only speaks to the confusion at the capitol and to our continued willingness to accept with hope whatever’s given us.
	Washington’s a few hours away, but Harvard recently became a similar ground zero for this belief in The Total Answer. The unexpected shooting of a Salem State student on campus a few weeks ago had an almost cinematic quality: start with a shocking, utterly incomprehensible act of violence, loop back to the origins of the event. That gunshot, ripping open a balmy May afternoon, exposed a network of campus drug use, undergrads both buying and selling. Students and police are still trying to piece it together, to tie together the shards they’ve been left with into a neat movie ending.
That’s the nature of our belief, after all; that’s what we’ve been trained to do. Kids these days, up on their Pynchon and following “The Wire,” think of the world as studded with allusions, teeming with hidden meanings. We lap up explanations and cure-alls; we accept the experts’ forecasts (never mind that they got us here); we tape on our rose-tinted glasses, cross our fingers, squeeze our eyes shut, and hope with all our hearts for change—the kind we can really believe in. That’s faith, real faith, and it’s being practiced on a massive scale in households all across the U.S. of A.
Students entering the job market now are by necessity full of that faith. Sure, the new millennium came with its decade of birth pangs, they reason, but the grass will be greener soon enough; for now, at least, it makes sense to bunker down at a non-profit or graduate program and play it cool for a while. And that’s just fine. Constant disappointment, however, is always the greatest test of faith. Another few years of this, and even the most ardent believer may find himself a hard-bitten atheist.

America will remain the world’s sole superpower for some time. Nevertheless, the geopolitical landscape is gradually becoming a multipolar environment where China will be a key player. If Beijing tries to attain hegemony in Asia, deterring it will be more complex than simply augmenting our already-enormous defense budget. A promising grand strategy to constrain China’s growing clout might couple offshore balancing—building a partnership of other powers opposed to Chinese dominance—with an effort to counter China’s unique methods of espionage. And while there is nothing objectionable in anticipating strategic challenges, Washington should not magnify its own insecurities to an extent that it worsens Sino-American relations.
If China’s relative power rises, it is liable to desire its own sphere of influence and this is natural. According to Kenneth Waltz and other prominent political scientists, all nations, regardless of regime type, attempt to maximize their power in order to survive in the inherently anarchic international system. As such, even full-fledged democratization in China is unlikely to affect its objectives. Much like how the US established and still sustains the Monroe Doctrine, China may try to set up an equivalent system.But while regional primacy can be healthy for a Great Power, it unfortunately gives heady policymakers visions of grandeur. In limited, specific instances, projecting power on a global level is feasible as well as desirable. Dominating the international system is not. America learned this the hard way in the Middle East. Worldwide hegemony is not only incredibly expensive, it breeds resentment among states and or non state actors; as a result, balancing blocs arise to repel would-be-empires. China’s decades-old border disputes with Russia and its newfound awareness of energy politics in the Persian Gulf mean Moscow and Tehran probably view its rise apprehensively. Consequently, America can find common ground to cooperate with both nations if it alters its policies, particularly toward the latter. 
Moreover, China’s awakening is especially worrying to its East Asian neighbors, several of whom possess or can quickly develop nuclear deterrents. As a precaution, many have already formed military pacts and strengthened their security apparatuses. India countered China’s growing sequence of bases in Central Asia and the Pacific Rim by accelerating its own production of a blue-water navy and enhancing security ties with the U.S., France, Russia, and Japan. A mutual fear of China also prompted former adversaries South Korea and Japan to start a symbiotic relationship on defense issues. 
If China displays offensive intentions, America should champion such burgeoning associations while maintaining a moderate (rather than substantial) naval and air presence nearby, in case of emergencies. Critics of this approach argue—with some justification—that the alliances are too tenuous to mature. India’s federalism might make preserving a single foreign policy arduous. The fractious debate in Japan over the “normalization” of its military, currently bound by constitutional strictures, also persists. On the other hand, brewing security concerns are apt to outweigh domestic impediments to balancing. 
But even offshore balancing will only limit China’s power, not erase it. China still leverages its sway over North Korea to keep the West anxious, and its recent veto on a major Asian development bank project also illustrates its might. 
Still, when making auxiliary plans, it is critical not to inflate threats. For example, China has yet to build a functioning aircraft carrier. Ironically, Beijing’s emphasis on obtaining its rivals’ technological secrets, rather than innovating, places it at a permanent disadvantage. Admittedly, China has a disincentive to represent its capabilities, but reports also indicate America spends ten times more than China on defense, enough to prevail in a limited conflict. 
This does not mean a nationalist China is committed to what its own government has dubbed a “peaceful rise.” China’s dual-pronged espionage campaign remains menacing. First, Chinese hackers conduct extensive cyber-warfare. Second, China gathers human intelligence in a manner markedly different from the former Soviet Union. Whereas the KGB extracted sensitive information from a few carefully chosen assets, China’s Ministry of State Security uses a web of informers in businesses, educational institutions, and governments, many of whom probably don’t even consider their actions to be “spying,” to collect bits of data. The individual’s contribution may be miniscule, but the final product is a detailed portrait. And though many of China’s spies may not be professionals, the pool’s vast size offsets its lack of training. 
All Great Powers engage in and protect against espionage, but the U.S. has been loath to criticize Beijing for fear of antagonizing its largest foreign creditor and or losing access to China’s rich markets. This indicates that financial interdependence, though economically beneficial, does little to mitigate global rivalries and often severely alters the power dynamics in relationships between states. Ultimately, America should respond by being wary at home and by increasing its own intelligence-gathering abroad. Given its clandestine nature, this cannot evoke bitterness the way overt military force does. 
Optimists suggest that international institutions can socialize rising powers, making them responsible—rather than revisionist—stakeholders. Sadly, our world is likely to remain a Hobbesian place. As China’s intentions are unclear, it is wise to hedge one’s bets—even if China is decades from its potential. But being confrontational is counterproductive. If we treat China like a hungry dragon, it will become just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If you don’t pursue what you think will be most meaningful, you will regret it,” President Drew Gilpin Faust warned the Class of 2008 in her Baccalaureate address last year. Speaking before a class of graduates, 38 percent of whom had elected careers in finance and consulting, Faust nevertheless sensed an anxiety that seniors had found their chosen professional paths somewhat “troubling.” As she anatomized the problem, “You are not sure if a generous starting salary at a prestigious brand name organization together with the promise of future wealth will feed your soul.”As Harvard gathers once again to solemnize the rites of Commencement for yet another graduating class, another such round of soul-searching does not seem out of place. While the percentage of our classmates destined for corporate cubicles certainly may have dwindled in these depressed economic times, the concern that Faust articulated last year retains its currency. In fact, without the plentiful powerful and high-paying positions Harvard students had begun to presume as their birthright awaiting them upon graduation, these once merely academic and existential concerns have assumed a new urgency. What should I do with my life after graduation? Or, to put it more broadly: How should I live? What kind of life is most choice-worthy? These are fundamental questions of a first order. Ignore or dismiss them as we may, our daily actions, choices, and beliefs imply some sort of answer—not always coherent and consistent, and indeed often arbitrary and unreflective. President Faust rightfully exhorted her first class of graduates carefully to consider such questions. Yet over the past four years, Harvard has done woefully little for its students, failing not only to prepare them for the challenges of our peculiar economic predicament, but more importantly to instill in them an aspiration and savor for the life worth living.The “meaningful” life, in Faust’s context, naturally is used in a relatively restricted sense. Tellingly, she contrasted the toilsome life of the financier with the apparently richer and more rewarding lives of the actor, artist, public servant, and journalist. Harvard’s abundant extracurricular interest in those putatively more meaningful pursuits may justify Faust’s presumption that, were money not an obstacle, students would prefer them to the arduous,  although handsomely remunerated, tasks of Wall Street.But why Harvard students—or anyone, for that matter—should choose, among innumerable other options, drama or poetry or non-profit work is a question seldom answered or even posed. The contemporary academy long has denied the relevance, importance, or solubility of such questions. Even to inquire about the most choice-worthy life implies a hierarchy of values, a notion that the ascendant progressive prejudices cannot compass. You have your values and preferences and I have mine—we have no objective, external standard against which to measure them and ultimately disprove one and confirm the other. According to this regime, for example, sexual mores, no matter how perverse, are matters of indifference: to think otherwise is intolerant and judgmental. This principle extends to matters academic also, as Harvard does not dare distinguish with regard to intrinsic worth the study of the Classics from that of Women, Gender, and Sexuality.Such distinctions, however, are precisely those which ought to be made. A proper liberal-arts education, the kind which Harvard still prides itself on offering, should cultivate in its students an appreciation for and dedication to the life of the mind. Traditionally understood, this implies not a ravenous appetite for promiscuous knowledge regarding all sorts of curiosities and trivialities, but rather the pursuit of truth and the contemplation of beauty. The liberal arts were those studies befitting the liber, a free man—one free not only from physical enslavement but also the more debilitating and servile subjection to irrational passions.In that same speech, President Faust defined the liberal arts as those that “empower you with the possibility of exercising agency, of discovering meaning, of making choices” because “the meaning of your life is for you to make.” In other words, liberal education is an essentially self-contained and self-serving project. Not recognizing an objective standard—such as the “Veritas” ironically still emblazoned upon the University arms—the sagest counsel that Harvard can permit itself to offer its wards is: do what makes you feel good. “Meaning” in life cannot arise from anywhere but from within, from “being true to yourself,” i.e., to whichever prejudices you acquired before you arrived at Harvard or those you have absorbed in the four years since. The goal of your elite education has not been, as Plato famously conceived it, to ascend above the unilluminated ignorance of the cave. Instead, afraid to cause offense by privileging one view over others, Harvard has aspired simply to make us feel more comfortable in our darkness.Too many Harvard students today, as Faust correctly seemed to indicate, cannot be bothered thinking seriously about the good or “meaningful” life. To have succeeded in gaining admission in the first place required an intense drive and prodigious ambition. As such, concerned almost exclusively with the even loftier rewards and honors to which their degrees will entitle them, most do not want to waste intellectual energy on matters that do not have a clear, tangible benefit. Despite President Faust’s plaints—delivered, on the eve of Commencement, perhaps too tardily—her institution deserves the bulk of the blame. Students, untutored and undirected, cannot be too harshly indicted for wanting to cash in their many talents for fortune, prestige, and power. The liberal arts should educate those passions, inspiring at the very least an awareness that the greatest goods in life are not simply creature comforts or those simple and low pleasures of the herd. And certainly, true happiness and “meaning” do not reside in satisfying the inclinations of the passions or unexamined prejudices.The goal of a Harvard education should be something truly noble: not only to make men wiser, but to make them freer as well. Yet on almost all accounts, she has failed to live up to this charge. In advocating a life attentive only to the standards or values that the individual arbitrarily has chosen himself, fair Harvard—while believing that she is broadening her students’ minds—rather subjects them to the vilest and most dehumanizing slavery.

Last fall, when introducing Al Gore at Harvard’s Sustainability Celebration, President Drew G. Faust asserted, “Universities are the world’s greatest source of ideas and innovation.” Theoretically, ideas generated by university scholars are disciplined by the scientific method, vetted by peer review, and made accountable through open publication with clear authorship. Talk radio, the blogosphere, and even The New Yorker operate by a lower standard.Unfortunately, even our best universities sometimes stray from Veritas into mere “truthiness.” Harvard’s Sustainability Celebration last fall also featured a session on “Sustainable Food,” timely in 2008 because a sudden increase in international food prices had pushed 100 million more people around the world into hunger, on top of the 850 million others–mostly in rural South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa–who were already suffering from chronic malnutrition before prices went up. Yet none of the invited speakers at Harvard’s session on food had much interest in this larger problem, or any academic standing to address it. One was a celebrity restaurant owner from San Francisco, the second led an organization called Slow Food USA, and the third was a noted playwright and actress from New York. Apparently Harvard had found no reason to seek the opinion of a trained nutritionist, or a demographer, or an agroecologist. Not even an historian. The message from this panel of non-scholars fit perfectly with bi-coastal elite fashion: Our food should be organic, local, and slow. These ideas have no scholarly pedigree. The assertion that food should be grown without synthetic nitrogen fertilizer (“organically”) can be traced back nearly a century to an Austrian mystic named Rudolf Steiner who also believed in cosmic rhythms, human reincarnation, and the lost city of Atlantis. The idea of eating locally comes from the founder of a community-supported kitchen in Berkeley, California. The idea of slow food was first popularized in 1986 by an Italian radio journalist.If we take these ideas seriously for the moment, what might a fully organic, local, and slow food system actually look like? The closest approximation we have is not New York City or Berkeley, California, but rural Africa, where 60 percent of all citizens are small farmers growing food without chemicals, for local consumption, and still preparing meals in a traditional fashion. The downside? Average income in rural Africa is only $1 a day and one third of these people are malnourished. Virtually all food in rural Africa today is de facto organic, because small farmers there cannot afford to purchase any nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilizer use per hectare in Africa is only 1/10 as high as in Europe or North America, causing crop yields per hectare to be only 1/5 as high as their Northern counterparts. Total production level has been declining on a per capita basis for the past three decades. African food systems are also highly local. Most food production is consumed on the farm, and the portion marketed does not travel far. This is because of high transport costs linked to a poor road system. Roughly 70 percent of all rural Africans live more than a 30-minute walk from the nearest all-weather road, so when seasonal rains are good, surplus production cannot be moved easily for sale in another district at a higher price. Even worse for these true Locavores, when the crops fail in a drought, food supplies from nearby surplus regions cannot be brought in.  Food systems in rural Africa are also painfully slow, especially for the women who prepare the meals. In order to serve a meal of nsima (maize), African women must first spend a season planting, weeding, harvesting, and storing their corn, then they must strip it, then winnow it, then soak it, then lay it out to dry, then carry it to a grinder or pound it by hand, then dry it again, and then finally—after walking to gather fuel wood and water—build a fire and cook it. These organic, local, and slow African food systems are also bad for the natural environment. Attempting to grow more food to keep pace with an increasing population, Africa’s farmers have shortened their fallow times, which exhausts soil nutrients. They also expand cropping and grazing onto more erodible lands, cutting more trees and destroying more wildlife habitat. Roughly 70 percent of all deforestation in Africa comes from this expansion of low-yield farming. It would be better if these farmers increased crop yields on land already cleared by applying some nitrogen fertilizer, but that would violate the mystical organic taboo. A plea, then, to Harvard’s splendid new graduating class of 2009. When you leave the university, be wary of seductive ideas not sufficiently vetted by academic scholarship. When endorsement by academic specialists is missing, there are usually good reasons. Also, think globally, not just locally, before you embrace a fashionable new choice. The non-academic purveyors of fashion seldom do.Robert Paarlberg is Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College and a Visiting Professor of Government at Harvard University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The spectrum of reviews regarding the past four years are wide and varied. Anecdotally, most have enjoyed their time here, and are hoping to maximize their happiness in their final days as relatively carefree undergraduates.Others, though, have engaged in a perpetual countdown in days to our graduation, hoping that life after would somehow prove fulfilling in a way that Harvard has not been.I am, in some ways, a product of both belief sets. The continued realization of the eerily applicable clichés also comes with a sense of regret—that, on some level, the resources not consulted, friendships not made, and places not seen have been an institutional failure, one that could have been avoided had I been better advised to spend time with different people or do different things.It’s when the latter thought process becomes prominent that it becomes clear for its fallaciousness. Institutional failures certainly exist—my time in charge of the one you are reading helped me learn as much—but an experience made up of so many moving parts, diverse events, and disparate happenings is an institution that we, thankfully, have the most agency on making what we want it to be.Sometimes, though, we attempt to take that agency beyond its most reasonable and beneficial extreme. We are all tremendously privileged—as evidenced by our mere presence here—so a sense of entitlement is no surprise. This entitlement is in fact, helpful towards the maintenance of certain standards at a place that prides itself on consistently being the best. And true, there are instances where efforts to fundamentally alter some aspect of Harvard’s undergraduate institution are worthwhile.But we undermine our own agency when we become a protest-happy, outrage-fueled student body that is more reactionary than methodical in its approach, more emotional than thoughtful in its line of attack.The student response to a recent announcement of budget cuts from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in an attempt to make up a $220 million deficit is a sadly glaring example. Safety concerns as a result of cuts in Quad shuttle services (especially in the context of the increasing number of reported crimes as evidenced by police advisories) were well placed, as was anger about the timing and nature of communication (or lack thereof) from the administration regarding the cuts.But at a rally organized by student leaders to voice displeasure with poor communication from the deans, message discipline was not the order of the day. Were we upset about not being able to eat hot breakfast during the week? Was our outrage directed at our beloved dining hall workers, who might have hours cut as a result of the changes? Or were we simply angry about the fact that we heard about all these changes during the artificially stressful reading period?The reality is that, for certain students with certain needs or relationships, there was reason to be upset about some of the budget cuts, or the way they were communicated to us. But the majority of those students who will return to Cambridge next fall when the budget cuts have taken place will go about their lives relatively unaffected, or in other cases, with minimal adjustments. Aspects that are significantly debilitating in some way should be addressed, but a catch-all protest against the very generally-defined “out of touchness” of the FAS and College deans only helps to undermine our credibility when there’s a real issue worth protesting. An escalation of the War in Vietnam these budget cuts were not, as our similarly-idealized predecessors of 40 years ago would be quick to remind us.There are problems with this institution that need addressing. The unfortunate escalation of seemingly racially-motivated incidents by the Harvard Police Department that took place at the beginning of this academic year prompted a substantive effort to determine what could be done to prevent them in the future, a frank admission by HUPD officers of their shortcomings, and a notably conciliatory effort to make some necessary reforms.But when a now-estranged student cries racism for her apparent complicity in a truly heinous crime, a deadly incident that took place weeks ago in a seemingly safe College residence, it falls deafly on the ears, I think, of those who are in positions of power to make the most important decisions.It is a truth that became apparent in my own year-long experience as The Crimson’s leader. Our institution is but a microcosm of the one that I have just become an alumnus of, but even on a small scale, it is clear that constant, entitled self-marginalization and victimhood weakens one’s ability to make the very reforms that may be the necessary and right thing to do.If we have been disappointed by our time at Harvard, perhaps it is worthwhile not to immediately blame the institution. Looking inward, exercising restraint and approaching our final moments here with a mature assessment of both the College’s and our own accomplishments is a worthwhile endeavor. And if our pragmatic president has taught us anything, it’s that right now, there’s nothing as cool as staying cool. Malcom A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As you know, the College has recently announced the elimination of various services as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences attempts to bridge a substantial budget gap. In these tough times, we must all make sacrifices, and each of us must bear our fair share of the burden. In that spirit, we regretfully inform you of these additional policy changes for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Late night shuttle service to the Quad will continue, but cuts have forced us to replace the shuttles with giant multi-person bicycles, which must be pedaled by the students. Further cuts have required us to shorten the route of late night service during the weekend and shuttles will now pick up students from a deserted alley near Cambridge Common. Due to budget cuts, the lighting in this area has been eliminated. We want to stress, though, that these cuts have freed up additional funding for brain break, and we have arranged for special brain breaks for the entryway of any students who are mugged.
You are already aware that in order to begin to bridge the gap in the Harvard College Library budget, we have made the difficult decision to close the Quad Library. Additionally, to save money, Lamont Library will be limiting service to first-year students and to students living in the River Houses. Quad residents are encouraged to make use of the University’s many other libraries, before they are slowly phased out. An additional cost-cutting measure has forced us to convert Widener Library into a student center for graduate students.
Under the new budget, the dining hall experience will change slightly. In addition to the elimination of hot breakfast, dinner will be just warm, and lunch will be tepid. In order to maximize the efficiency of the budget, all swipers will now be considered full-fledged concentration advisers, with full study-card signing rights. Rising food costs have forced us to severely reduce the menu options, most of which will now be based around plain bread. These cuts do not mean, of course, that we are prepared to compromise on accommodations, and students with special dietary needs are strongly encouraged to talk to their Allston Burr Resident Dean about withdrawing from the College. The dining halls in Cabot House, Currier House and Pforzheimer House will close completely. Please keep in mind that these cutbacks have freed up funding for the long overdue replacement of the electronic information display consoles, which will be newly fitted with IMAX 3D displays.
Unfortunately, the cuts extend beyond residential life, into the classroom as well. Sections will have more students on average, and students, gradually, will become dumber. Since Teaching Fellows will no longer be paid a living wage, grades will be contingent on tips. All sections will only meet every other week, and sections in the Government Department will be replaced by showings of “West Wing” reruns. Undergraduate advising has been eliminated, and will be replaced with a do-it-yourself guide to advising, written by a committee of faculty in the style of a “choose your own adventure” book. Due to cutbacks, this book will only be made available on the Internet. The Q Guide, which we previously thought would be made available in electronic form as well, will instead be passed on by word of mouth in a new oral tradition. Students in the Quad will no longer have concentrations.
We realize that these changes may come as disappointing news, but we urge students to look on the bright side. Opportunities often emerge from adversity, and not all the news is bad. For example, running water will still be supplied to the Quad on weekends and to the Currier “Ten Man” on alternate Tuesdays. And we have specifically set aside funds for the completion of a new undergraduate student center on Mt. Auburn Street, to be finished in time for the College's quadricentennial in 2036.
We do not take these difficult decisions lightly. University Hall understands the hardship this will mean for undergraduates, and we are all making sacrifices. For example, at a recent faculty meeting, the champagne was arguably subpar. As a symbol of our shared sacrifice, the statue of John Harvard will be meticulously chiseled down to a smaller size in proportion to the budget cut, at a cost of $2.6 million. Since improvements like this, and all the amenities of Harvard life, do not come cheaply, we ask for your kind, tax-deductible donation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pomp and circumstance has quieted to a whisper and graduation hats no longer silhouette the sky. Family and friends join together in restaurants for celebratory feasts and at one dinner gathering in Faneuil Hall’s Union Oyster House, the seemingly impossible happens. The ink still wet on their diplomas, two friends–the potential leaders of our future–share in a dialogue alongside several visionaries of centuries past. The illustrious guests, graduates from schools of philosophy and schools of hard knocks, contemplate tomorrow while still baffled by today.As our newly minted alumni–Shirley Smart and Edgar Eager–peruse the menu of possibilities, the waiter sets the scene with the ubiquitous question, “what would you like to order?” With spectacles resting on the bridge of his nose and amazed by modern-day use of electricity, Franklin chimes in with his baritone voice while busily marveling at an iPhone. His choice from the menu: innovation. Dazzled by the past two centuries of achievements, he is likely discussing bio-fuels while Shirley and Edgar teach him to twitter. The wise Ben Franklin would speak illuminating words for our recent graduates, inspiring them to recognize the power of innovation in all its forms. And if told that it’s not on the menu, he would simply provide the recipe.Though Franklin’s keen mind might immediately produce an aphorism from Poor Richard’s Almanac on the collapse of Wall Street in October, one of the other guests lingering at the table might be left utterly befuddled by the cataclysmic events of our time. Adam Smith, founder of free market economics, might query his own writings from The Wealth of Nations regarding government intervention in capitalism. When asked by the waiter for his order, the eccentric Smith replies with a knowing smile: perseverance. But it is plausible that the confusion of our economic meltdown would lead to restless nights for the absent-minded professor from Scotland.As the sun sets on this June evening in New England, the steadfast courage of Harriet Tubman fills the air. Encouraged by the idealism of our “melting pot” nation, she would be gratified to see an African-American as president. Tubman’s humanitarian efforts now might span oceans to infiltrate regions of the globe where civil liberties are severely curtailed or tragically nonexistent. Whether in Darfur or Myanmar, knowledge gained from her struggles with the Underground Railroad to free slaves might well be applied in achieving emancipation for others. Perhaps she would consider leading Amnesty International or becoming a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador. Her menu selection: global freedom from oppression.As our recent graduates are served an entrée of opportunity it is likely that our legendary pioneers from yesteryear would charge them with the responsibility of being the link between past and future.Shirley Smart and Edgar Eager’s path to Harvard began in primary school. From across the table, the champion of universal first-class elementary education chimes in. Horace Mann, architect of American public schooling, ponders the debate over private education, charter schools, and educational reform. He tells the two graduates that today’s youth must have a toolbox of knowledge if they are to build a better tomorrow. Distant in thought and dabbling on a laptop, he probably wonders why race and class discrepancies still exist in childhood learning. While Edgar informs Horace Mann about Teach for America, the waiter takes his order, pragmatism. Franklin’s eyes consider a second entrée, but just then the professional voice of Dr. Osler comments upon Benjamin’s expanding girth.   Sir William Osler, father of modern medicine, catapulted clinical practice forward by centuries. Marveling at heart transplantation, gene sequencing, and tissue engineering wizardry, Osler might perseverate on why millions lack access to basic primary care. Troubled by a nation advanced in technology but crippled by the problem of equal access to quality health care, the doctor places his dinner selection: compassion. The consummate healer eloquently speaks of aequanimitas–a balanced state of health, wisdom, insight, and clarity.Though demurely silent among the spring evening voices of other icons, the verve of Rachel Carson comes to life as the conversation shifts to a planet in crisis. As the inspiration for grassroots environmentalism, Carson’s zeal penetrates the celebratory ambiance surrounding Shirley and Edgar. By questioning the status quo she inadvertently laid the groundwork for what was to become the Environmental Protection Agency. She might tell all at the table to speak without fear, stand one’s ground and be grand in vision. Carson’s choice from the menu: activism.As these legendary leaders in science, economics, human rights, education, medicine and ecology savor their conversation, Shirley Smart and Edgar Eager suddenly realize a common thread: Despite individual taste, the universal ingredient for a better world can ultimately be none other than inspiration. A life of meaning necessitates a diverse diet, encompassing everything from compassion, freedom, and activism to innovation, pragmatism, and perseverance. And lest we forget, nothing is complete without the crystal clear twinkle of the finest wine: le vin de Joie de Vivre.

In the spirit of imminent change that grips the world into which we graduate, I believe it fitting to start at another time—1969—a time as unknown to us graduates as the uncharted waters beyond our Commencement. That year, change was in the air, Nixon was in the White House, and Vietnam was on everyone’s mind.Around the time our predecessors marched on Harvard Yard to protest that war, one of the finest literary figures of the century, Jorge Luis Borges, was at Harvard to deliver the prestigious Charles Eliot Norton lectures. Judging by their content, one could think Borges was not in touch with the profound transformations occurring all around him—rather than talking politics, he devoted the lectures to his recurrent literary themes: remembering and forgetting, poetry and metaphor, the craft of verse. Yet during his time at Harvard, Borges lived through an experience that eventually inspired his most relevant short story. On a spring morning, Borges took a walk by the Charles River, and sat on a bench close to Dunster House to rest. Despite his blindness, he noticed he wasn’t alone—someone else was there. But when he talked to “The Other”—as the story based on the incident is called—Borges was horrified to hear his own voice answering his questions, except that the voice was decades younger. The man next to him claimed to be barely 20 years old and in Geneva; he even said it was 1918.And so, on an otherwise ordinary morning in 1969, by the Charles, Borges met himself.The two men tried to dismiss the bizarre experience as a dream, or nightmare. But they soon confirmed they both were Borges—one in Cambridge, on the Charles’ shore, the other in Geneva, on the banks of the Rhône; one lecturing at Harvard, the other composing his first poems; one cynical about the unstoppable march of History, the other waxing idyllic on the brotherhood of all men; one at the dusk of life, the other at its dawn. Borges told his younger self about the life that awaited him: his family, the endless pages yet to be written, and even the looming World War that would dwarf the first one. Only literature–Dostoyevsky, Coleridge, Hugo–brought them together, yet their interpretations profoundly differed. Ultimately, Borges and The Other were the same person, but they were also strangers. Too much time, too many experiences came between them. So Borges recalled Heraclitus: One cannot step into the same river twice, for neither one nor the river are the same. Those of us who passed through the Dexter Gate four years ago “to grow in wisdom” would not have recognized those of us who depart today “to better serve [our] kind.” And more than any specific concentration or class, paper or professor, there is one lesson at the core of our transformation.As obvious as it sounds, Harvard has taught us to succeed. There is no need revisit the impossible odds associated with gaining admission to this college—such fortune should humble us. We have been taught by a Faculty chosen for their unrivalled ability to revolutionize their fields of study. We have won access to their minds, and they have enriched our own. We have sung for outstanding a capella groups, played for impressive sports teams, written for the most prestigious college newspaper in the country, and perhaps even dressed in drag for Hasty Pudding Theatricals.But just as empowering as those victories have been our defeats. Those strangers who arrived here four years ago were not likely to have faced failure–hence they were enrolling at Harvard. During our time here, however, we have had to learn to fail the hard way. Perhaps it was a newspaper “turkey shoot” election, perhaps sports tryouts, maybe a laundry list of academic honors, or even just being turned down for lunch at Adams House. Learning to lose in this ultra-competitive, yet cushioned, environment has changed us dramatically: It has prepared us for the uncertainty beyond the ivory tower. If we consider the root causes of the current financial debacle that currently occupies all headlines, it becomes clear that recognizing and facing our shortcomings is necessary medicine for our social ailments, as is coming to terms with our inability to accurately predict what is to come. We cannot foretell the changing tides of Heraclitus’ river. Yet learning to fail inherently means learning to curb our hubris—and that is a lesson of personal growth I hope each of us takes through the gates.  On the banks of the Charles, Borges was glad his younger self never asked him how successful his verses and books would be. As we face the unanswered questions of where, to whom, and to which causes we shall devote our lives, let us leave today with a promise: to remain true to an ever-changing path, yet always armed with Harvard’s lesson of how to succeed–and also how to fail. The standard may be a daunting one. But the goal is paradoxically clear: That many years from now, when we meet ourselves on a spring morning by the Charles, our younger selves will be proud of the path we will have put ahead of them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard College has striven over the past four years to impart on us a breadth and depth of knowledge that few institutions of higher learning could rival. From freshman seminars to sophomore tutorials to senior theses, we have all worked incredibly hard in our own fields, reading, writing, doing problem sets, and pouring blood, sweat, and tears into our academic experience. We have also taken what amounts essentially to distribution requirements (as dirty as the phrase might be) in other disciplines, learning how magical numbers can be or how the dinosaurs lived. However, while, for the most part, Harvard sets the bar for the academic side of education, we have learned far less in life matters than our peers at less esteemed and admired institutions. The “Harvard Bubble” is real, and we are insulated by it from reality. Too much coddling from the College is harmful and has been detrimental to our overall education.House life at Harvard is wonderful and provides many unique opportunities for interacting with and learning from our peers, but it completely insulates us from the worries of everyday life. It is possible to graduate from Harvard never having cleaned a bathroom, never having cooked a meal, and never having had to look for an apartment or pay rent. All of these things are taken care of by the houses, and while the shared dining halls bring students together, and dorm crew prevents us from having to clean up after our disgusting roommates, the sorts of life skills that would be gained in the absence of these privileges are important. Most of our peers have already learned them by the time they graduate from college and enter the “real world.” I have no doubt that most Harvard students will learn how to cook and clean once they graduate, but the complete isolation from such necessary tasks makes much of our education less grounded. While we have been absorbed in the concerns of academia, other aspects of “life” have been taken care of for us. A better balance would be beneficial.Harvard further insulates us from the outside world through the easily-obtained extensions on assignments and exams that are offered to students. Many professors and teaching fellows grant extensions to students here, sometimes for legitimate reasons such as illness, and sometimes for less legitimate reasons such as procrastination and poor planning on the part of the student. While these extensions might be beneficial in the short term in allowing students to receive higher grades, they are in the long term detrimental. There are many aspects of life here that promote procrastination, particularly assignments stacked towards the end of a semester, but possible extensions make procrastination even worse and create incentives for poor time management. Students will learn the same amount of academic material regardless of the deadline, but there is something to be said about teaching time management and the ability to meet deadlines in the first place. I am not arguing for a greater degree of paternalism on the part of the University, but rather that expectations should not be so flexible with the bar being lowered on a case-by-case basis.Another area in which Harvard fails to teach more important lessons is in the area of criticism. There are far too many teaching fellows and professors who fail to criticize students when they make mistakes. It would be entirely possible to go through a course, especially a larger course in the Core, and make completely inane, off topic comments throughout the sections without ever being told that the comments were “wrong.” Perhaps TF’s consider it rude or insulting to tell students that their arguments or insights are incorrect, but this does the students a grave disservice. Rather than learning from mistakes, students do not even know when a mistake has been made in many cases, and so discussion sections become essentially useless as the good arguments are often not separated from the bad.And while the hesitancy with criticism affects us negatively academically, it has far more profound an impact outside of the classroom. In particular, harsh, honest criticism is so rarified that students do not learn first how to accept and learn from criticism, and second they do not learn how to support and modify their positions. When criticism is encountered in outside contexts, it is either rejected or shied away from. Further, there is a sort of “perfection complex” that develops as a result.An example of this is a fear of telling outsiders that one is from Harvard, the so-called “dropping the H-bomb.” Doing so creates high standards and expectations, and many are not prepared to face potential failure or criticism. As Conan O’Brien described in his Class Day speech in 2000, once one is identified as a Harvard student or graduate, it is even more difficult to make mistakes because the immediate response will be, “Didn’t you go to Harvard?” The high standards from the outside world come from Harvard’s own inflation of its image, and this creates a fear of mistakes or inadequacy. Even within Harvard, many are overly modest because they are fearful of their peers’ talents. When someone says that he plays an instrument but that he is not very good, it means he has only appeared at Carnegie Hall once. This heightened modesty is good in the sense that it minimizes arrogance, but it is damaging in so far as it undermines individuals’ self-confidence and keeps them from even trying in the first place. The sheer sense of intimidation that many freshmen feel is incredible, and Harvard does not do enough to help students learn that it is okay to make mistakes. The exploration and risk-taking that should occur do not; GPA and perceptions matter and stifle openness.Harvard undoubtedly has provided us with an amazing academic opportunity. Writing coherent and compelling 20 page papers 4 years ago would have been unthinkable. Those in the sciences have an understanding of complex material that they certainly did not have before. But for all the knowledge we have gained, there is much that we did not learn because we attended Harvard. Useful life skills, reasonable expectations, and the ability to accept and learn from criticism are all lessons that many learn in their college years, yet we were largely isolated from these lessons by Harvard and its focus on academics and success. The whole college experience should be focused on much more than academics, and Harvard should strive in the future to focus as much on the non-academic aspects of growth and learning as it does on the learning in the classroom.Shai D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If people lived on the moon, I suspect they would find objects from the Earth more valuable than those in their lunar home. Similarly, I know I would find a rock from another planet fascinating, even if it were utterly useless—what would matter to me most is where the rock has been.
We seniors have been here at Harvard for the past four years, and it’s time to ask the question: how much does that matter? To what degree has Harvard prepared us for success? Or, as J. K. Rowling put it in her commencement speech last year, to what extent has it prepared us for failure? Despite Harvard’s opinionated student population, the university’s biggest challenge remains providing us with a well-balanced education offering a variety of ideological views, the kind of diversity we are likely to encounter in the world beyond our gates.
Four years ago, when I entered the U.S. for the first time, the campus reminded me in some aspects of a space colony. One of its most immediately puzzling aspects was political. I remembered reading what Naomi Klein had written in January 2000 about the American left: that it apparently “seemed surprised to learn that, contrary to previous reports, it did, in fact, still exist.” Although news reports tried to convince me that Republicans were in power, I saw very little Republican presence on campus, and didn’t know any personally. Although I would meet a few eventually, the political uniformity reinforced my notion of Harvard as a somewhat sheltered planet of its own.
Sure, most of us would not seek to go to a school where ideological diversity is completely maximized. It is unpleasant to face constant disagreement, and college is supposed to provide more than challenging conversations. Even so, it’s a shame that it’s so easy to live on campus for months or even years without really experiencing what psychologists call cognitive dissonance, the feeling of holding two contradictory ideas at the same time. While questioning our positions generally feels unnatural, few things are as essential. I sincerely hope that after four years here, we will be more inclined to change our minds when exposed to new facts. 
What is sometimes even more difficult to change than our views are the internal “choice rules” that we hold. In some way, many of us have learned the most not from texts and lectures, but by observing our reactions to them and by becoming aware of our habits of thought and the limits of the human gift for “zooming out” to reflect on a subject from the perspective of someone else. The key to my learning, at least, was the attempt to eliminate an automatic creation of opinions. 
Not long ago, some experts questioned the usefulness of higher education, claiming it essentially fails to increase students’ productivity and reviving the theory that we use our degrees to merely “signal” skills or ability to employers, with actual learning taking place on the job. It was therefore reassuring to talk to an experienced professor recently who told me about his first experience of teaching a freshman seminar. Prior to teaching freshmen, he only worked with upperclassmen and his new teaching assignment allowed him to realize one thing. Apparently, we may be more enthusiastic as freshman, but our thinking and writing leaves a lot to be desired. Somehow, by the time we reach our senior year, we mature in both respects, he said.
Of course, in its attempts to supply us with as much of what we desire as possible, Harvard is a purveyor of much more than education. Although it is not quite clear whether former university president Larry Summers really referred to the college as “Camp Harvard” he was not far from the truth if he indeed had made the comment. We swim in activities and sometimes neglect classes. The word “camp” also implies a fixed space, which quite accurately describes that few of us leave campus as frequently as we all agree would be beneficial for our health. The term “Harvard bubble” has gained a firm place in our vocabulary for this reason. 
Summers told us shortly after resigning that we should never ask what we are against; we should define ourselves by what we are for and do our best to make a difference. One cannot really fail by being against an opinion or a policy: it just means living in a state of perpetual disagreement with the external world. Failure is possible when we are for something, and that’s what we should choose to do in the years ahead.

Were some super advanced alien civilization to swoop down to Earth with the definitive explanation of everything in the cosmos, there’d be excitement at first—it would be thrilling to have answers to questions we’ve tussled with through the ages. But in short order, scientists worldwide would be utterly depressed. With no remaining mysteries, the scientific journey would halt.Whenever I speak about this to middle and high school students, I am struck by how surprising they find it. To the vast majority, science is solely about answers—the material that’s sandwiched between the covers of their textbooks. It’s understandable. For the most part, we teach science as if it were a technical trade: Learn these facts about cells. Memorize these equations describing motion. Balance these reactions that underlie oxidation. And then demonstrate competence by passing an exam. With this lopsided focus on the end points of research, the scientific explorations themselves receive the most minimal attention.But science is the journey. Science is about immersing ourselves in piercing uncertainty while struggling with the deepest of mysteries. It is the ultimate adventure. Against staggering odds, a species that has walked upright for only a few million years is trying to unravel puzzles that are billions of years in the making. How did the universe begin? How was life initiated? How did consciousness emerge? Einstein captured it best when he wrote, “the years of anxious searching in the dark for a truth that one feels but cannot express.” That’s what science is about.To be a scientist is to commit to a life of confusion punctuated by rare moments of clarity. When I leave the office at night, the confusion comes with me. Ruminating over these equations, seeking patterns, looking for hidden relationships, trying to make contact with measured data—it’s all uncertainty and possibility engaged in an endless chaotic dance. Every so often the blur resolves, but the respite is short-lived; the next puzzle demands focus. This, really, is the joy of being a scientist. Established truths are comforting, but it is the mysteries that make the soul ache and render a life of exploration worth living.My own field of research, the quest for a unified theory, is no stranger to uncertainty. A unified theory seeks to meld Einstein’s theory of gravity, a framework that’s relevant when things are large, with quantum mechanics, a body of laws that come into play when things are small. We’ve known for half a century that each of these models works well in its own domain, but each also proclaims that the other is defective. Melding the warring antagonists is essential to gaining insight into other great mysteries—what happened at the big bang, the true fate of matter crushed at the center of a black hole, even the nature of time. I began working on string theory—one of the most promising approaches—25 years ago, as a young graduate student hungry to make a mark on the physics world. It was an exhilarating period leading some to proclaim naively that the insights of string theory would be so sweeping that the end of physics was near. Of course, as more-seasoned observers knew, the end was not near. Even today, while we’ve witnessed stupendous progress and the resolution of problems many thought beyond reach, a final assessment of string theory remains elusive.To some, this has been a disappointment. But that’s not how I see it. For me, the past decades of anxious searching have illuminated spectacular new landmarks: extra dimensions of space curled into tiny labyrinthine geometries, a cornucopia of universes bubbling up beyond the most distant cosmic horizon, the fabric of space and time being stitched from threads of vibrating strings. These are the partially formed, stunning possibilities that efforts have revealed so far. Are they right? I don’t know. No one does. There’s a chance that the new accelerator in Geneva, the Large Hadron Collider, may give us the first experimental insight.Regardless of the outcome, the journey has been exhilarating, and through it I feel an emotional connection to the cosmos that I don’t think I could have acquired any other way. My intuition tells me that this particular odyssey will arrive at a promised land, perhaps confirming today’s theoretical insights, perhaps in a future form that will have evolved significantly. But if not, in the unlikely event that the work on which our generation has labored doesn’t make it into textbooks, I can live with that. It’s what happens along the way that radically enriches us. The wrestling with mystery, not the ascension to resolution, defines who we are.Brian Greene ’84, a physics professor at Columbia University, is the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos. This piece originally appeared in Wired.

For a while, the Harvard Jazz Collective was big time. Really. You may not have heard of us, a modest five-piece jazz ensemble founded in the fall of 2005, but like any other major musical act, we had recordings, a rehearsal space, even groupies. We played with Herbie Hancock; we played for Mitt Romney. At our peak, a Harvard class reunion paid us a thousand bucks to play for approximately an hour and plied us with wine and food. I think it’s safe to say that, as an acoustic jazz group composed of Harvard undergraduates specializing in late 60s modal jazz, we were peerless. If the stature we achieved seems exaggerated, remember that Harvard sustains a ton of silly, often pretentious things—like bowties and a cappella groups—that the real world has more or less gotten over. This adds to the place’s manufactured mystique: Those outside our bubble of obliviousness recognize that Gatsby parties and fencing are outdated, but our investment in archaisms, niche pursuits, and outlandish concentrations—not majors—is why we’re here. Jazz is no longer the seething cultural rebellion it once was—it’s quickly simmering into a classical genre—and for many, it’s just another goofy tradition that Harvard has saved from extinction. But it actually thrives here, which is part of why I was so eager to come to Harvard.Like any other Harvard applicant, I was well rounded—or insanely overscheduled—but jazz was a core component of my identity. I was in love with its lore, its improvisatory spirit, and I diligently practiced tenor sax an hour each day. I didn’t apply to conservatories, but my college list was limited to those that boasted strong jazz programs. I listened to the stuff almost exclusively until I was 17, and my application’s personal statement was 500 words of gushed, schmaltzier-than-Kenny G prose—I think, God help me, that I called performing “electric” and music “the highest means of human expression.” (Or something; that essay’s been lost to the ages, and if the admissions office has a copy, I’d like a word, thanks.)During my first weeks on campus, like found like, and the jazz nerds of the world united. None of us planned on making jazz our lives, but we expected it to be a big part of our college experience. Five us formed a group, self-consciously dubbed a “Collective” because, hey, we knew all about that pretension. We probably couldn’t have found gigs in the real world, but luckily, there are a thousand Harvard organizations that need light jazz for cocktail parties, holiday functions, and formals of various stripes—and they prefer undergrads. We, of course, preferred audiences that came to listen, even if we didn’t necessarily merit them; but we didn’t mind making mood music as long as we were also making money, so we took all the gigs we could get. All of us in the Collective also played with the Harvard Jazz Band, which allowed us to perform with guest artist luminaries such as Jon Hendricks, Roy Hargrove, and Roy Haynes—musicians I’d been listening to since middle school. That jazz band made us the main act, and for once people sat and listened to us instead of eating hors d’oeuvres in our general vicinity. The group threw around money so that we could play with artists I’d idolized for a decade; even as my technical abilities stagnated, the largesse of Harvard gave me opportunities that friends who pursued music academically didn’t always have. As we realized our luck and the rare position we enjoyed, it became apparent to my bandmates and I that jazz was something the real world treated as background music.That realization hastened jazz’s fade into the background of my own life. The curious alchemy of Harvard also played a part; my time here transmuted my interests in mysterious ways. I had once treated jazz as a possible future occupation, but during my time in college I stopped practicing and found that I couldn’t ignore the allure of rap and rock (I guess I’d been missing lyrics). I became increasingly interested in writing about music, not playing it.A few weeks ago, the Harvard Jazz Collective, after almost four years of existence, played its last gig at the Adams House Formal. We’re close friends now, and the experience meant a lot to us, if not to the modest, probably trashed crowd in the dining hall that inexplicably preferred our take on “swing” (mostly later Miles Davis) to the DJ upstairs. For most of us, it was probably our last chance to play the working musician; we were closing our instrument cases on a decade’s worth of practice. We packed up the drums, loaded the dollies, and prepared to move on with our lives.The most painful aspect of making my way through Harvard was realizing that some things I considered integral parts of my identity were fated to turn into hobbies; that, as time progressed and possibilities were whittled away, not every bullet point on that college application was destined to become my life’s passion. I never planned on making jazz my life—I simply don’t have the love for the saxophone that turns eight hours of practice daily from a chore into a routine—but I never thought it would be relegated to the background to the extent that it has been here. No matter. As long as Harvard supports quaint old jazz, Collectives will come and go, and other musicians will get a taste of what might have been.Jake G.

We are proud alumnae of Harvard College—one fourth-generation and white, one first-generation and African American. We took different routes to Harvard, but each of us experienced class, race, and financial struggles. Now, as educators who devote our lives to reaching out to underprivileged communities, we share a common concern.
Many students, as we well know, make it out of these extraordinary environments—some earlier, thanks to scholarships, to prep schools, or elite summer programs and participation in organizations such as Upward Bound and MESA, and some later, through admission to top colleges, including Harvard. We applaud Harvard for offering unprecedented financial support to low-income students, helping many first-generation college students, including those from at-risk communities. However, as evidenced by significant research and a recent article in the Boston Globe, the inclination to believe that providing access and financial assistance is enough is both wrong and dangerous. One of us broached this issue with President Drew G. Faust when she visited Los Angeles last year. Her response implied that financial assistance and current programs were all that these students needed. 
We believe that by opening the door to these students, Harvard has taken on an obligation to do much more. 
Existing programs in financial aid, academic support, and counseling certainly help individual students to adapt but are not sufficient to help develop a safe community for these first-generation college goers. The extraordinary essence that has enabled these students to thrive before Harvard will not readily transfer to their newly privileged roles as Harvard students without a comprehensive program to help them identify and navigate the transparent privileges and outsider status that confront them everyday.
They need much more support if we want them to make the most of their Harvard experiences, which will differ in multiple ways from those of their peers. These students must be invited to join communities where others share their goals and their experiences. We want to hold on to the students’ hearts and minds, to enable them to thrive rather than merely survive in this wonderful community. Other universities—including University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Boston College—recognize the challenges these students encounter. Rather than leaving the students to sink or swim, they provide a host of options similar to the support system that we recommend Harvard put in place. Students who go through these programs link them to their ability to stay in college and to thrive as students navigating several complex worlds.
With these goals in mind, and recognizing the challenges, we issue the following call to action to President Faust, who despite these tough economic times admirably remains steadfastly committed to financial aid outreach to students from low-income families.
The Call to Action:
1.	Task force and office: Harvard should create a task force and a professionally staffed office for supporting underrepresented students at Harvard. This will include first-generation college goers who are Harvard professors, low-income students, experts on student retention, and other interested and experienced alumni and community members.
2.	Summer bridge programs: Dozens of universities across the country offer these two-to-four week programs for underrepresented students. We recommend Harvard offer one for all students receiving significant financial aid packages and other first-generation students. This transition program would offer classes on study skills and ways of navigating Harvard—from receiving financial aid to communicating with professors to balancing work and school. The program would also offer socialization conversations and peer support provided by students from underprivileged backgrounds. Each following year, these students would return for shorter programs that explore traversing several worlds, finding work after college, and ways to give back to their communities.
3.	Freshman orientation workshops: Freshman orientation is a wonderful entrée to the exciting world of ideas and an opportunity not only to warm up one’s intellectual muscles but also to engage with one’s incredibly interesting and diverse peers. Harvard should expand its current orientation programs to encompass a series of workshops on diversity, including socioeconomic diversity, and on being sensitive to the first-generation college-goers in the classroom. Workshop leaders might include high-profile alumni and current students who came from these backgrounds, and testimonials from roommates, teammates, and others they encountered.
4.	School-year meetings, forums, and workshops: Throughout the year, students could attend workshops and meetings to continue receiving support. Student groups such as the Harvard Black Student Association and Fuerza Latina could join these programs. 
5.	Expand academic, peer, and counseling support: Harvard’s Bureau of Study Counsel would expand its wide array of counseling, workshops, discussions groups, and courses to address the needs of first-generation and low-income college goers. It would train its tutors, group leaders, and peer counselors about the unique academic, socio-economic, and institutional challenges the underrepresented students may experience.
6.	Website and e-mail outreach: Much like the Financial Aid Office e-mails that help students navigate their finances, Harvard would e-mail students about resources and support and would design a website for underrepresented students. Interested students and alumni would create blogs about their experiences. The site for UCLA’s Academic Advancement Program could serve as a starting point.
7.	Campus “Clothes Closet:” The Financial Aid Office would solicit alumni for gift certificates to local retailers that would allow students to purchase winter clothes and other needed clothing for Harvard life.
8.	Mentors and outreach: During the school year and summers, Harvard would formally match students with alumni mentors to provide additional guidance on navigating higher education, including early graduate school counseling, career counseling, money management, and other life skills.
9.	Giving back: Students will work to help prepare other first-generation and low-income students to reach for the academic stars. Similar students at Princeton developed their own group to prepare students for college. What better role models could future Harvard students have than those who came before them?
In providing this improved support, Harvard will do a service to students who benefit from its financial aid policy that mirrors that generous, visionary initiative. We call on President Faust and the whole Harvard community to place these ideas on the front burner. We ask that alumni and alumnae join this call to action, by helping fund summer programs and donating their time for mentoring programs all around the country. We ask that student leaders and faculty advisors answer this call by joining forces to aid this increasing pool of first-generation and low-income matriculating students, to ease them through the many transitions en route to a Harvard degree.
Let us continue Harvard’s generosity beyond the financial arena, to provide the additional support that will help these students to acclimate more readily to the Harvard environment and make the most of their hard-earned Harvard opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Athletics have never—ever—been my strong suit, but when I talk to my mother about Harvard, I wind up running defense. She’s coming at me with endowments and advising and “Why should you have to pay to see your peers perform?” and “Why can’t the house just open storage early for you?,” and I’m right back at her with economic realities and intellectual independence and “Student groups support themselves” and “That’s just the way it is.” It’s helmet to helmet almost every time, but her maternal indignation is no match for my impulsive rebellion. I’m on the defensive before she’s even chosen a play. The funny thing is, most of the time I agree with her.
It’s like an out of body experience. Words are coming out of my mouth on one plane and I’m listening to them on another, thinking “Really? I’m the great defender, here?” More often than not, I’ve been frustrated with Harvard and, to be honest, there have been occasions when I’ve questioned my decision to come here. Harvard’s administrative structure is notoriously non-intuitive, and the doors to University Hall and the Holyoke Center seem to be revolving constantly as deans come and go. I’ve felt backed into corners by bureaucratic academic departments, apathetic professors, fierce competition for limited opportunities—and occasionally all three at the same time.
But despite all of this, when I graduate in December—more on that in a bit—there is no question that I will be a better person than I was four years ago, and that Harvard has made me so.
Yes, I took time off. The fall of my junior year—and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. We start here at 18, and not only are we facing down an institution more august and more challenging than anything we’ve ever imagined, we have to figure out where we fit in. As a freshman, I threw myself into the theater community with the force that only a freshman can muster. I was earnest, eager to please, and I wanted to make theater my life. I was in the Loeb every night from 6 p.m. to midnight—in the rehearsal rooms, in the Ex, in the Mainstage, in the shop—for however long I was needed, and after that, as long as I was tolerated. I was exhausted and overworked, and I thought that I loved it.
Turns out, Harvard is a crucible: We throw 1,600 of the world’s brightest, most dedicated, least sleep-dependent young adults together, then crank up the competitive heat, and the impurities burn off. You have to figure out the few things worth holding on to, while all the rest—the interests you thought were callings, the hobbies you thought were passions—fizzles away. It’s the Harvard way of saying you can’t do it all: Almost no matter what, someone is already doing it better than you.
Harvard theater gets very little non-financial support from the University, which is great in the sense that Harvard students get to take on jobs like directing and producing that at other universities would be afterthoughts for professionals. It would be easier, yes, but less enriching if Harvard worked that way. If you love it, if you’re focused and energetic and talented and tireless, then there is no better feeling than the one you get just before the lights come up on opening night. But I wasn’t any of those things, which I realized in the spring of my sophomore year. It was terrifying, actually. When I was no longer funneling all of my energy into theater, I felt like it was leaking out everywhere, getting lost in the great beyond.
Lucky for me—and for everyone, I suppose—personal energy is like water on pavement: It finds all the cracks and crevices. That fall I got an internship in New York at a radio show called Studio 360, and started writing for The Crimson in earnest the following spring. My theater experience, meanwhile, made itself useful on the sidelines by getting me on the tech crew of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. If Harvard had made things easy for me, I might never have figured out that theater was one of the hobbies and not one of the passions. Like a massive lineman, Harvard doesn’t stop to make sure you’re okay when it knocks you down. It keeps running, and it’s up to you to figure out how to get up and get back in the game.
So thank you, Harvard, for tackling me. It might have been nicer of you if you hadn’t, and I’m sure that my mother would have preferred it, but I’m glad that you did, because that’s how the game ought to work. That’s also how the world works, right? So now I’m ready for it. Okay, Mom?

It’s one of the hardest games to play. When forced to engage in unheard-of budget cutting, Massachusetts, like every state, must play the dicey stakes of determining which areas to cut and which to preserve. Not all of its decisions have been prudent, however—recently, state funding for families with disabled members was cut to the tune of $78 million. This budgeting decision represents both an unethically blind approach, and a financially shortsighted venture. 
Living with a developmentally or physically disabled person completely changes the scope of almost every aspect of one’s daily life. Nowhere is this burden greater than for the parents of a disabled child, a population that has been shown in medical studies to undergo more physical stress than almost any group. To pull the plug on support for this dedicated demographic is unacceptable. A defining characteristic of our species is its care for the sick, and for the government to turn its back on this mission, even in the midst of a tough financial climate, demonstrates a startling confusion of priorities.  
The moral dimension aside, the cut may additionally end up costing the state more than the $78 million it saves in cutting these services in the short term. To understand why, it is important to clarify where this money was being funneled in the first place. One of the biggest problems for disabled youth is connecting with their peers and being taught how to live independently; often, they lack opportunities to enjoy regular lives and interactions. The bulk of the existing funding goes toward helping support centers sponsor events like bowling trips and athletic contests to encourage fellowship and social time. Built into many of these events are crucial moments when children are placed in situations through which they must maneuver themselves. Something as simple as asking for directions or reading a map could make the difference between integration into regular life and not.  
If these support services that offer disabled persons a window into lives of normalcy are cut back, so too will be the chance for that person to be able to live at home, an ultimate goal for most of these families. Those people who fail to successfully integrate into society always have the option of government housing centers, but this is ultimately far more expensive for the state than the little money it takes for a trip to a state fair or an ice cream social. From a strictly numerical standpoint, the difference between these options and this cutting is egregious; local care is often cheaper on the order of one hundred times. 
Those families with developmentally disabled persons will not let this budget pass without a fight. There have already been protests, letters sent to congressmen, and advocacy campaigns. And a victory has already been won—on May 20, the state legislature voted in favor of an increase in the state sales tax, in order to help assuage the damage from these deep cuts. But this raise in revenue still leaves many services closed come the fiscal year 2010.   If Massachusetts chooses to think with moral sense and fiscal reason, it will not cut funding to some of its most helpless constituents. A portion of what it would have saved will be buoyed by the federal stimulus package and the new tax, but in the long term such dollars and cents thinking is beside the point. For a moment, policymakers need to put aside their pocketbooks and consider the quality of life of all their citizens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just after spring break, I piled up the things that I’d accumulated while writing my thesis, intending to return what belonged to the library system and to archive the rest. Doing so, I noticed that the cascade of piles on my desk told the physical story of what I had just done. On one side stood three shelves of books and a plastic bag full of field notes and collected articles: my raw material. Next to that lay a heap of notecards and a folder jammed with typescript drafts covered in edits and marginalia: my shopfloor assemblies. At the far end sat two neat stacks of the printed final copy, bound and totalized: the finished consumer good.It was a startling reminder that thesis-writing was an act of material as well metaphorical distillation. I had built a thesis out of books and notes and drafts, no differently than I had built a desk out of boards and pegs and paint over the previous summer. Martin Heidegger once wrote “Denken ist Handwerk”—thinking is craftwork. This observation, simple and revolutionary, contains within it the assertion that thinkers and intellectuals are bound into the same matrices of morality and creativity that control all humans who build things—that is, everyone.We commonly assert that labor executed by the mind—reading, writing, analyzing, and criticizing—is fundamentally different from, and in some way superior to, labor executed by the hands. Why? A clever speech, a lively poem, and a novel scientific discovery all possess an inherent and self-secure beauty that demands no propping up through comparison. A well-built chair, a useful trinket, and a clean bathroom—these too are things of beauty and of humanity. Our own labors are not diminished by a broad extension of this franchise of value. For the polyurethane on a student’s desk is no more or less important than the books on it. The vast majority of Harvard students will spend their lives toiling with their minds. We will find employment as professors, lawyers, businessmen, authors, artists, and politicians. We should remember that these professions are still crafts; they are still assemblies of knowledge which have been passed down through generations in order to express the constructive urge that makes humanity special. Harvard, after all, is a trade school for the craft of thinking, and its students are no more than a privileged class of apprentices who mimic the techniques, manners, and values of their masters.Filling out a Selective Service registration form, the great essayist and country farmer E. B. White wrestled over what to enter for his primary job. “Physically I am better fitted for writing than for farming,” White wrote of the situation, “because farming takes great strength and endurance. Intellectually I am better fitted for farming than for writing.” The irony, of course, is that White was both a first-rate intellectual and a competent husbandman—cultivated and cultivator. We too should aspire to this kind of creative holism, where the distinctions between human activities are slowly eroded and erased.When we maintain that thinking is craftwork, we reflexively maintain that craftwork is thinking. I spent eighty hours of my Senior Week cleaning dorms, an undertaking that prompted more than a few people to ask whether I was out of my mind. I suspect this question would have been less frequently asked had I spent those eighty hours peering at nucleotides or penning sonnets. And yet for all my sterling-grade education, I cannot see a meaningful difference between any of these things.What we must do is to insist, stubbornly and in spite of the blinkered view from our perch, that on the scales of dignity all labor weighs equal. In doing so, we perform an act of unification by conjoining all citizens, from the philosopher to the policeman to the plumber, into the commonality of humanity’s unfolding history, a history precipitated out of the sum of thousands of craft activities. We assert that Homo sapiens—the wise human—and Homo faber—the making human—are the same item. And we emancipate our own education from a self-inflicted ephemerality by insisting on its integrability into a common fabric that is humane, concrete, and stitched out of the universal pride of creation.Garrett G.D.

Africa, a continent of nearly one billion people with the world’s highest mortality rate at every age group and from nearly every cause, has no in-depth, large-scale longitudinal studies of its people’s health. No studies similar to Harvard University’s Nurses’ Health Study, which has studied lifestyle factors of 121,700 female nurses for 33 years, down to what they drink and eat, how much they exercise or smoke, and detailing their family and reproductive histories exist. Harvard, with its unmatched experience in this and other large cohort studies, is uniquely placed to share this knowledge with African colleagues, and to jointly learn from them. This lack represents a critical information vacuum in Africa, a continent being hit with a double dose of disease. Infections including tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS have been seen as Africa’s major health burden. But now, in addition to these, there is a rising epidemic of chronic, non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, mental illnesses, trauma, cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Chronic diseases are projected to cause more deaths in the region than infectious diseases by 2030.The shift in disease burden has a number of root causes. Victories against infectious disease mostly affecting children lead to more people living to adulthood, and thus an increase in chronic diseases. Economic development leads to lifestyle changes that increase the risk for chronic diseases. For example, shifts from agrarian to urban living results in less physical activity, more processed food, and exposure to more air pollution. Most African governments lack information and resources to respond to this growing crisis.  A cohort study enrolls a defined population and follows them over time.  Besides the aforementioned lifestyle choices, participants may also be asked about environmental and occupational exposures, mental health, social relationships, living conditions, and economic circumstances. Biological samples such as blood, saliva, urine, and nail clippings can be collected to measure toxins, hormone levels, or genes. These observations over time allow for an in depth understanding of the reasons for health and risks for disease. A great advantage of cohort studies is that they enable scientists to study multiple diseases (for example heart diseases, cancer, stroke) and multiple risk factors (diet, exercise, air quality) over an individual’s lifetime.Cohort studies have proved crucial in understanding non-communicable diseases in the US. A primary example of the public health impact of cohorts is knowledge about the heart-clogging effects of trans fat, something common in processed foods. Information gleaned in part from Harvard cohorts led to mandatory trans fat food labeling in 2006, and its subsequent ban from restaurants in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Cambridge and California.  The regional disparity in cohort research is enormous. Taking into account population, cohort studies of Africans have produced a tiny fraction of medical research articles compared to wealthier areas. For every one article on high blood pressure published on Africans, 9 are published on Europeans, and 50 are published on people from the US. Disparity in the actual numbers of adults enrolled in cohorts is even worse. Taking into account population, we estimate that for every African enrolled in a cohort study, there are 190 Europeans and 1,000 Americans enrolled in cohorts.    We do not doubt that smoking, obesity, high salt intake, sedentary lifestyle, and pollution will have similar adverse health effects in Africa as they do in other places. Why then do we need cohort studies in Africa? We suggest at least five reasons. First, there may be unpredictable interactions between the simultaneous infectious and non-communicable disease epidemics unique to Africa. Second, it is important to determine population specific disease burdens in a region with few birth and death records and other health statistics. Third, humans evolved in East Africa, making African genetic diversity greater than elsewhere in the world. Studying the interaction between environmental factors and genes elucidates disease mechanisms. Fourth, the unparalleled geographic, social, and cultural diversity may reveal risk factors as yet unknown. The final reason is to generate locally relevant results to stimulate political will for health promoting policy.    The Harvard School of Public Health and African scientists have begun an ambitious project to start cohorts of 100,000 people in each of 4 countries covering west, east, and southern Africa. Doing so would reduce the US-Africa disparity in cohort enrollees from 1,000-to-1 down to 20-to-1.  Cohort studies require substantial investment in personnel and infrastructure, but give immeasurable returns. These studies can run for decades, so in addition to research objectives, they build local capacity for future research by training students and scientists, making the effort locally sustainable. Thus far, international organizations and funders have overlooked this urgent need.   We believe that large cohort studies are a proven design that will serve African public health, and could also yield information relevant to the chronic disease epidemic in the US. The bold African Cohort Initiative aspires to fill this knowledge gap, and seeks equally visionary funders to bring studies that have enormously benefited wealthy countries to Africa. The time for action is now, before the problem escalates, so that results can guide successful prevention programs.

The current graduating class earned its diplomas during the very early stages of an information revolution. As we prepare to leave Cambridge it is worth thinking about whether the tidal changes in how we read, write, and speak to each other might distinguish our experiences from those of our predecessors.
The proliferation of communication-gadgets-cum-appendages has profoundly increased the speed at which we all operate. With the aid of our ubiquitous laptops and cell phones, the viral circulation rate of cultural memes never ceases to amaze (within four days, no less than 21 million viewers had paid witness to Susan Boyle’s on-stage coup d’état). The more fundamental change, however, has come in the content, volume, and sources from which we glean our information. The scope and depth of answerable academic questions has broadened dramatically with the advent of digitized databases. Indeed, it is inside the classroom that the Harvard student has most directly experienced the much-celebrated “democratization of knowledge.” Wikipedia and other free information databases that are created and accessed anonymously pose a serious problem for the priests of high culture, raising questions about how anyone’s words can become christened as everyone’s knowledge.
Amidst these changes, we have grown up as a generation of instant gratification. The simultaneous rise of video technology and online news sources has engendered a profound sense of nostalgia—not entirely unjustified—lamenting the disintegration of our national discourse into one of soundbytes and an American youth plagued by generational ADD. After observing a teenager’s impatience with the sloth of text messaging, comedian Louis CK commented wryly, “Your message is going to space. Give it a second.” Moreover, our vocabulary has come to reflect the speed at which our words are spoken and sent: Since we “obvi” don’t have time for those extra two syllables, our new bevy of “abbrevs” can sometimes be pretty “egreg” (egregious for those over 22). But our impatience with technology is not entirely without productive potential. A number of recent studies, for example, have confirmed that we are better multi-taskers than our parents, a fact poignantly illuminated when Firefox asks, “There are 40 tabs open. Do you want to quit anyway?” 
More worrisome than our shorter attention spans, however, is the alienation that accompanies the new ways in which we inform and communicate with each other. In the academic realm, we can now search for terms in Google books without reading the book itself. This may work wonders for a short response paper, but it also comes with an irrevocable loss of context and depth. For the handful of classic works that deserve to be read in their entirety, isolating key passages can collapse the dimensionality of argument that make them worth reading in the first place. Similarly (and duly noted) the arrival of the personal computer in the lecture hall has challenged the college classroom’s traditional role as a special type of community. It is exceedingly difficult to simultaneously transcribe with precision while fully engaging with a complex and discursive argument. While boredom and distraction are certainly not unique to the 21st century, the laptop has no historical rival in its capacity as a portal to infinite distraction. Nothing quite interrupts a lecture on 18th century Romanticism like the fateful “ding” of a G-Chat. The simultaneity of our physical presence and virtual absence in the lecture hall suggests that, for all its wonders, ultra-connectivity can come at the cost of sharp and atomistic disconnects.
On the other hand, the information revolution has provided concrete (if controversial) benefits outside the classroom. With the recent burst of social networking sites comes the criticism that we have sacrificed depth for breadth in our relationships. A fellow senior reflected on the discrepancy between Facebook and his real social life: “There is no way that I have 900 actual friends.” But this provides an overly restrictive framework in which to consider the new ways in which we interact online. We can distinguish between the “core” elements of friendship—connection, laughter, and empathy—that remain independent of the medium through which they are forged. There are many friendships that would thrive even if Pony Express were the only method of communication after Harvard. An online social network’s real impact is not strengthening the core relationships around you, but bolstering connections within your network of peripheral acquaintances. 
To get updates about someone’s life through pictures, posts, and video does not require physical proximity. Perhaps even more important than boosting our ability to multitask, the information revolution has bred a generation of remarkably good stalkers. In the extreme, this can become voyeuristic. An unrelenting barrage of Twitter updates threatens excessive intrusion for both readers and writers, challenging our most basic understanding of the concept of “privacy.” But for the most part, our online interactions are a natural response to a new and generational exhibitionism; after all, Facebook albums and Tweets are posted precisely because others will see them. In this sense, coming of age in the early bouts of an information revolution has laid the foundations for a radically different conception of community, one enriched by public identities that are created expressly to be shared with those outside our circles of closest confidence. Long after leaving the hallowed halls of veritas, the class of 2009 can continue to build a historically unique communitas—a globally accessible forum in which to articulate shared ideas, issue spirited dissents, and strengthen peripheral relationships—140 characters at a time.

Where has the political opposition gone? Ever since its early division between Federalists and anti-Federalists, the United States has prided itself on possessing a two-party system. Lately, however, this model has begun to seem outdated—while the Democrats enjoy their new place in office, a serious challenge from the GOP is nowhere to be found. A piece in The Economist captured the current vacuum best, reporting that the Republican party is “about as popular as celibacy among 18-30-year-olds.”
Perhaps we should take a minute to pull out our magnifying glasses and try to find the party that governed not so long ago. To foreign observers, the present state of U.S. politics may seem merely amusing, but the problem is a serious one—no country can function well under an essentially uni-partisan system. Democracy can only work in an environment of plurality and of checks and balances.
As it stands, the Republican party appears philosophically impotent, hoping that a sufficient number of voters is trained to cheer for the same old issues like opposition to taxes and gay rights. Clinging to them so stubbornly has led the GOP to shoot itself in the foot Cheney-style on a number of occasions, doing a major disservice not only to its own voters, but to the country as a whole. But rather than bolster its image with fresh policy proposals, the party’s current strategy seems to be to take a time-out and keep its fingers crossed for an epic presidential mistake.
Republicans could instead boost their popularity by tolerating different ideas within the party, abandoning the practice of labeling and excluding all those who do not embrace every item of their platform. Immigration, taxes and abortion cannot all be easily resolved with a firm “no.” How about taxing things we want less of (pollution) and decreasing payroll taxes accordingly, making adoption easier, and promoting a realistic sex education?
It is not an unreasonable request—the Republican party has shown such open-mindedness before. Often distortedly portrayed as an ideologue and willing captive of his age by both his admirers and nemeses, Ronald Reagan was extraordinarily skilled at finding middle grounds and weighing trade-offs. He could both condemn the Soviet Union and work constructively on disarmament with its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
He sought to protect “our constitutional right to own a piece of this earth” but also advocated government ownership of parks so that open space and natural beauty can be enjoyed “by generations not yet born.” Unlike many Republicans today, he not only opposed well-intentioned yet harmful laws and regulations but was also able to clearly explain why market laws are preferable to some government pursuits (without instinctively accusing it of being socialistic).
While Republicans today could learn an enormous deal from Reagan’s style of thinking and communicating, they would err tragically by emulating all his positions. Much has happened in the 20 years since he vacated the White House. The GOP urgently needs to recruit experts who understand how and why global economic and political trends have shifted. With most politicians spouting prepackaged boilerplate, such thoughtful analysis by Republicans is hard to find these days.
But at least two of last year’s Republican presidential candidates had a reputation for competence. Given the quality of Mitt Romney’s and Rudy Giuliani’s platforms, it is slightly puzzling that their journeys through the primaries were so short. Former Governor Romney, for example, supported the creation of a national catastrophic fund, as well as a ban of guns that threaten the police and had a vision for universal health care. He eventually migrated from the center, however, drawing accusations of populism, while a number of myths sank the candidacy of the former mayor of New York.
Giuliani was repeatedly depicted as only qualified to fight terrorism, while other strong features of his program were downplayed or overlooked. Though he had an excellent track record of reducing crime, it was his economic ideas that made him seem like a seasoned accountant. He advocated a change of the tax code that would both simplify it and ensure that businesses would not be penalized for operating in the U.S. rather than abroad.
Perhaps “pandering” to those who like effective government, he also intended to measure the effectiveness of U.S. ambassadors and embassies abroad. Bill Clinton would undoubtedly endorse this approach, since he said at Harvard in 2001 that “almost nobody in the Middle East knows” what the U.S. has done for the Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo, that he would tell young people in Kandahar how many Muslims died in the World Trade Center, and that “we have done a lousy job of getting our story out.” Giuliani promised to promote U.S.-Muslim exchange programs as president, hoping that the two cultures would find mutual ground and understanding through dialogue. 
Figures like this are conspicuously lacking in the political arena now. The current Obama administration has successfully avoided big missteps thus far, but no political party is infallible. A watchful opposition that would suggest policy improvements is a crucial factor in making sure that the government works in the people’s best interests. Still mired in the failures of the Bush administration, however, the Republican party has been unable to offer anything like an appealing alternative to the Democratic vision. Hopefully, knowledgeable politicians of the Romney and Giuliani variety will fill this void soon. Republicans, we may not always understand you, but—for the sake of our democracy—we wish you a speedy recovery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those who know me well will be surprised, and perhaps alarmed, that I am writing about anything remotely technological. As a young parent, it was I, rather than my child, who found the picture book “What Makes it Go, What Makes it Float?” revelatory. Younger staff frequently come to my rescue to perform upgrades, convert documents, synch my Sprint Treo, or print outsized spread sheets.  Some of my technology shortcomings arise no doubt due to the date of my birth. When I went to college I was outfitted with a state-of-the-art Smith Corona Silent Super typewriter. It was light green and came in a hard tan carrying case. I would never have thought to call it a manual typewriter because, of course, all typewriters were manual, right? Thus when I took a typing test for my first job and was confronted with a typewriter where all of the keys were stuck, it took a stunned HR person to introduce me to the on/off switch on my first electric typewriter. It was a full 20 years after my first job that I met my first word processor and understood that that term referred to a machine, not a person who was an editor. The first time someone yelled “the server is down,” I was terrified that some unknown staff assistant had been felled. I have experienced the horror of seeing a multi-page document scroll up at a rapid pace, deleting every sentence along the way. And I have many times been forced to use “Force Quit” when confronted with a frozen screen. A capable user now, I fully acknowledge that I am menu-driven at the desk as well as in a restaurant.  More importantly, however, I have learned to fully embrace the Restart option in my life. The power to begin again, to start afresh, is underappreciated as a life skill and it is one I hope that our graduates will come to approach with appreciation rather than apprehension. Successfully restarting through career and personal shifts and upheavals is life-affirming. And, as with the computer, restarting does not always mean starting out entirely anew. There have always been the equivalent of earlier drafts or saved messages—in other words, past experiences—to provide a base.My move to Harvard in 1996 to become the Assistant Dean for Public Service and Director of Phillips Brooks House was a restart for public service at the university. To some staff and many students it appeared that Dean Lewis was choosing a force quit option when, in reality, the forced change was a chance to reinvigorate how and where our students participated in service opportunities. Certainly, the move was also a personal career restart. It might have seemed a somewhat obvious next step for me, coming directly as I did from City Year, a youth service organization founded in Boston that was the model for President Clinton’s Americorps program. My position at City Year was already a personal and deliberate restart for myself, which I had taken after six years managing contributions for a bank and an additional two years raising funds and guiding donors at the Boston Foundation. I had craved a way to make a bigger impact on social problems and to be more hands-on in creating a new way for young people and adults to connect with the issues facing the community.There didn’t seem to be a path within the established organizations to make this impact, so I leapt out of the predictable world of banks and community foundations to work with a fledging entrepreneurial youth service organization that was always on the brink of insolvency. In my three and a half years at City Year, we grew from one site to six, from a leaky and cold donated wharf office to a renovated center city space, from an independent privately funded start-up to a member of Americorps, receiving over half of our funds from the federal government.The growth for me was equally vast. I learned Apple Computers, local area networks, email, venture capital, diversity training, thinking outside the box on a daily basis and much, much more. Most importantly, I learned how valuable it is to be forced—or to force oneself—to rethink old assumptions. Certainly, I had never thought of myself as being “entrepreneurial” or a “risk taker,” but putting those labels aside freed me to effect real change.Perhaps I was lucky in that I started out post-graduate life free of a clear path. I graduated from college in 1963, the year that Betty Friedan fired the shot heard around the world and ignited the Feminist Movement—at least in my white, middle class, college-educated world. It is hard for students today to understand how momentous it was to read The Feminine Mystique: how staggering it was to grasp that the path I imagined when I entered college was far too limited. My subsequent path, therefore, was always built upon conflicting expectations about what women in general, and what I in particular, could or should do. In hindsight, this turmoil was very liberating. Because I did not have a sense of my professional opportunities, and society was confused about what was appropriate for women, I was free to find my interests, take odd paths, even sit it out for a while.The class of 2009 has just such an opportunity. Many of you held assumptions about next steps after graduation that no longer seem viable. Some will need to take what may seem like a detour but which could ultimately become a welcome new path. If there is one wish I have for this year’s graduates, it is that they see this fiscal crisis as a freeing moment in which, since professional expectations are low, they are free to create and imagine a life that does not have a name or an established path. Our society needs many of you, even if at first reluctantly, to look outside established career paths and seek ways to grow while helping our communities and our nation confront serious issues of poverty and prejudice.This season I will be restarting with you. I will retire from Harvard at the end of August, and share your feelings—sadness at leaving mixed with excitement and nervousness in thinking about what lies ahead. Good luck to you all!Judith H. Kidd is the Associate Dean of Harvard College for Student Life and Activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of a successful comp for The Crimson, each new editor in my cohort was asked to name his or her politics for recording in a great book that no non-editor would ever be allowed to see. Amid a litany of “Democrat,” “Republican” and the occasional “democratic socialist,” my answer stood out for its confession of the shared reason that we were all together at Harvard and in the upper room of 14 Plympton Street: “intellectual elitism.” That moment of truth occasioned for me a clarity that I did not recover until I sat down to write this word of farewell to a community that, with all its contradictions, I love with the love of family.July brings the end of my half a lifetime of residence and rootedness in Harvard Yard—first as an undergraduate (1978-82) and then as a faculty-member (1991-2009). Next I will become chair of the Department of African and African American Studies and professor of Cultural Anthropology at Duke University, where I have been given the resources to help build the world’s greatest department. Though I am happy to go there, I am sad to leave the ground where the sapling vines of my spirit have become trunks supporting the growth of others. What seeds will I carry with me?As a StudentI learned that the most memorable part of a lecture class—in the absence of the experiential stories that reveal the humanity of the professor and the debates that recognize the students’—is the coffee, giant chocolate-chip cookies, and the inklings of doodles that the student brought with him or her into the lecture hall.By the time I reached Harvard, I had learned how to sit relatively still for an hour and to reduce others’ thoughts to halfway comprehensible scribbles.[no paragraph break here] Part of the trick to remaining sane while sitting still for so long is to allow the mind to wander invisibly. At best, it wanders to a place where the lecturer’s ideas are tested and challenged, which means that one has also missed ten minutes of the ongoing lecture. At worst, the mind simply counts the minutes until class is over. There is never a guarantee that all, or even most students, will, by the end of the term, be able to articulate most of the intellectual goals of the class. When I graduated, for instance, I couldn’t even have explained what anthropology is, and I was an anthropology concentrator.  The test of the professor’s efficacy is less the amount of information memorized by the student than the degree to which the student is infected or seduced by the words, gaze, and dance of the professor, the degree to which the student too comes to embody the questions that the professor is asking and the passion to come up with answers of his or her own. The greatest success is the student who pursues his or her own research. The student who does not turn trained precision of thought into a weapon against received wisdom might get an A for the elementary school lesson of sitting still. The student who learns the quickest route to a legitimizing degree and a six-figure salary gets an A for the lessons of vocational school. But the student who uses scholarship and words to resist the authoritarianism and the injustice of senescent power gets an A for the lessons of Harvard College. In the history of Harvard, many students and professors will mistake the socialist student activism of the 1930s, the African-American and anti-ROTC activism of the ‘70s, the South African divestment activism of the ‘80s, and the workers’ rights activism of the ‘90s for rebellions against the university. In fact, they are the new fruits of knowledge fertilized by the old fallen leaves; they are the seeds of the persistent refinement of scholarship across the generations.As a Harvard undergraduate, I learned that a good set of roommates—and by this standard, there is hardly a bad set—is central to collegiate intellectual growth. There could hardly be a better illustration than the wisdom of the Freshman Dean’s Office having assigned me to bunk in the penthouse of Grays middle entry with a tall, handsome, working-class and hilariously cynical white boy from Georgia. A lifelong hunter, he could hardly have seemed more different from me—a scion of the “Gold Coast” Afrostocracy of Washington. We irritated each other with occasional lapses in the tidiness that we both prized, but our late nights were never long enough for us to finish turning over the last rock of elite W.A.S.P. naivete and insincerity, or the last LP from the other’s collection that we’d never heard before. Today, from Wall Street, he tutors me in a vocabulary of life wildly foreign to me, and I do the same, undoubtedly, for him. But in our dialogues we are also always learning to take a thoughtful distance from our daily habits of thought and conviction.As a ProfessorI learned about the ambivalent role of hierarchy in the production of authoritative knowledge. I re-entered Harvard well-trained in the virtues of intellectual elitism, but only gradually became aware of its contradictions.Tenure at Harvard requires, above all else, copious publication. The peer-review process in scholarly journals and university presses subjects one’s work to harsh criticism by one’s intellectual rivals and demands punctilious caution in the handling of evidence and logic. The best way to guarantee success is to choose a specialty where mastering the entire literature is feasible and where one has few rivals. Such pursuit of expertise can generate finely tuned knowledge, but it can also generate territorialism and stifle debate. For example, another faculty resident in Leverett House in 1997-98 (when I lived there as a resident scholar) was a specialist in Near Eastern religions. His grand assertion one day that Islam and Judaism are the only two truly monotheistic religions prompted me mischievously to ask why the Hebrew god is sometimes called “Elohim,” a term ending with a plural marker. He told me to shut up, because he had been studying the topic for over a dozen years. That this fellow scholar did not receive tenure is a comfort to me. However, I cannot but recognize the ethos of which he is an unsophisticated manifestation. The cult of expertise—and the pride of being named the “top” expert, by virtue of being the expert at Harvard—sometimes makes us fear to question each other. Both faculty and administrators often make decisions that affect the state of knowledge and the functioning of the university, and I often feel that the explanation has not been made clear, that asking questions—particularly of the administration—is regarded as unfriendly. In fact, some in the current administration respond constructively to such queries, but that fact does not erase the historical ethos left by centuries of hierarchy and resistance to transparency. When they see a heartfelt challenge to the way things are currently done—as when I have complained about police conduct toward African Americans or about police undercover photographic surveillance of peaceful protesters on campus—many fellow scholars and administrators scurry away, in the fear of retribution, from a much-needed debate about whether things are as they should be.In the cult of expertise, one is encouraged to say nothing outside one’s expertise and nothing that is threatening to power before one receives tenure. Unfortunately, such functional timidity often survives tenure.A major effort that unites my specialist colleagues across disciplines is the periodic debate over the curriculum, which, each time results in a consensus that may last for a decade or more. We debate over which of our disciplines matter—and to what degree in today’s world of business, politics, warfare, and health concerns—with the intent to decide the mental shape of the next generation’s ruling class. But the intent to make such a decision is profoundly undemocratic and perhaps excessively confident that the processes that designate us as experts also qualify us to decide what the next generation should know. We mime a process by which tomorrow’s ruling class will also make such undemocratic but “expertly-informed” decisions about the poor and working people of the planet. The Harvard scholars who populated the Kennedy and Johnson administrations during the Vietnam War provide ample evidence that our expertise can bear grievous results. One hopes that the Harvard experts now managing the economy from Washington will do a better job, their past contributions to the global economic crisis notwithstanding.At Harvard, I have learned that universities are not neutral venues for the production of knowledge. Their architecture insinuates a framework that indeed penetrates the substance of knowledge. Lecture halls, for example, dictate the centrality of the expert and the silence of an audience whose members are invisible and inaudible. The audience would appear to have nothing to contribute to the professor’s knowledge or to its own. As a professor, I have learned always to turn my lectures into seminars, so that my students do not watch the clock and doodle as I did in college, or, in the contemporary alternative, e-mail and Facebook their friends about lunch.Universities are often assumed to be a space separated from power, as a precondition of the genesis of objective knowledge. At Harvard, I have learned that, in fact, universities are funded by government, foundations, alumni, and other private donors who often thereby determine which forms of knowledge are useful and prestigious. Sometimes, unreasoned ethnic interests prevail, as when, in 2006, a top scholar was denied a job at Harvard on account of his non-specialist critique of Zionism. Yet it is sometimes difficult to discern the intellectual logic, rules, or sectional interests that brought about such decisions by the deans.  In fact, deans do not have the statutory right to make such decisions, but they control the appointments procedure to a degree that faculty-members fear to oppose them. In department meetings, professors spend a lot of time guessing about how to satisfy the ego needs, idiosyncrasies, and disciplinary biases of the deans, who distribute the resources that make departments grow or wither.  Lacking tenure, the career administrators themselves constantly trade rumors about who needs to be in the favor of whom in order to survive or get anything done.Naïve scholar and teacher that I was when I entered Harvard a second time, I quickly received lessons in leadership that I hope will not be necessary to remember at Duke: When you take over a unit, fire or transfer anybody with power who does not owe it to you. Next, choose somebody with a high profile but tenuous backing to beat up on publicly. It cows everybody else into submission.As a Child Growing Up and Leaving HomeAt Harvard, I learned that time-honored reputation attracts a disproportionate number of the best scholars and the best students. But it does not automatically give rise to the liveliest dialogues among colleagues or the greatest global concern for fairness and justice. These desiderata require an additional collective effort, out of which the current University presidency was borne. However, the exodus of faculty-members of color that began during the Summers administration has actually accelerated this year. As observed even by departing professor and dean Lisa L. Martin, who is white, the current Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences does not appear to be committed to hiring or maintaining a diverse faculty. Moreover, it is unclear that Harvard has even thought about ways of making itself more hospitable to faculty with families. A vastly disproportionate number of Harvard professors appears to be unmarried, childless, divorced, or empty-nester. What limitations does this imbalance impose on the elite academy’s analysis of the world and instruction of its future leaders? As I leave Harvard, I leave with the love of a child for his imperfect parent, with the knowledge that the parent’s virtues and imperfections are the foundations of my own. I love Harvard, will always love Harvard, and will fight—from near or far-- to make it a better place. And I thank you--my teachers, students, colleagues, and staff--for being the trellis of my growth and the flowering vines on my trellis.J. Lorand Matory ’82 is professor of Anthropology and of African and African American Studies at Harvard. In July he will become the chair of the Department of African and African American Studies and professor of Cultural Anthropology at Duke University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Commencement approaches, Harvard likes to think it has helped to produce another class of leaders. But are leaders born or made? Is nature or nurture more important? I address these questions in my recent book, The Powers to Lead. 
How often have you heard someone say that a political candidate looks (or does not look) like a leader? A tall handsome person enters a room, draws attention, and “looks like a leader.” Various studies have shown that tall men are often favored, and corporate CEOs are taller than average. Moreover, tall men tend to earn more than shorter men. Other things being equal, an inch of height is worth nearly $800 a year in salary. But that may simply tell us about the stereotypes of what corporate boards think a CEO should look like and not that taller men are better leaders. Some of the most powerful leaders in history, such as Napoleon, Stalin, and Deng Hsiao Ping were little over five feet tall. 
Physical traits such as physique, intellectual traits such as IQ, and personality traits such as extroversion have been extensively examined by researchers, but with poor explanatory results. Tests have shown there is no leadership gene. While studies might find a certain trait to be significant, there always seems to be considerable evidence that fails to confirm that trait’s importance. Context is often more important than traits. The athletic child who is the natural leader on the playground may lose that dominant position when the group returns to a well structured classroom. For example, in January 1940, Winston Churchill was regarded as a failed politician, but after the British defeat in France, he was seen as a charismatic leader who could rally the nation. Churchill’s traits did not change in 1940; the situation did.
The traits-centered approach has not vanished from modern studies of leadership but it has been broadened and made more flexible. Traits have come to be seen as consistent patterns of personality rather than inherited characteristics. This definition mixes nature and nurture, and means that “traits” can to some extent be learned rather than merely inherited. We talk about leaders being more energetic, more risk-taking, more optimistic, more persuasive, and more empathetic than other people, but these traits are affected partly by a leader’s genetic makeup and partly by the environments in which the traits were learned and developed.
A nice experiment recently demonstrated the interaction between nature and nurture. A group of employers were asked to hire workers who had been ranked by their looks. If the employers saw only the resumes, beauty had no impact on hiring. Surprisingly, however, when telephone interviews were included in the process, beautiful people did better even though unseen by the employers. A lifetime of social reinforcement based on their genetic looks may have encoded into their voice patterns a tone of confidence that could be projected over the phone. Nature and nurture became thoroughly intertwined.
Genetics and biology matter in human leadership, but they do not determine it in the way that the traditional heroic approach to leadership suggests. The “Big Man” type of leadership works well in societies based on networks of tribal cultures which rely on personal and family honor and loyalty, but are not well adapted for coping with today’s complex information based world. Institutional constraints such as constitutions and impartial legal systems circumscribe such heroic figures. Societies that rest on heroic leaders are not able to develop the civil society and broad social capital that are necessary for leading in today’s networked world. Modern leadership turns out to be less about who you are, or how you were born than about what you have learned and what you do as part of a group. Nature and nurture intertwine, but nurture is much more important in the modern world than the heroic paradigm gives it credit for. Rather than think of your fellow graduates in terms of a particular type of heroic individual—male or female—look instead for indications that they (and you) have developed the judgment to broaden your bandwidth and cope with the wide range of new situations you are bound to encounter. That contextual intelligence will be the key to effective leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Picture a pack of playing cards sorted into suits. Shuffle the cards together and deal them out into new piles, but imagine that cards with similar affinities will gravitate toward each other. The original suits will exert some pull, but cards of like denominations might also attract one another. Perhaps face cards will form a group, or even red-card black-card societies. If subtle affinities like these are allowed to play a role during the deal, what is the likelihood that you’ll deal out the original suits?Now think about the faculty of this university as an enormous stack of cards, a thousand in FAS alone. The cards are currently sorted into decks of varying sizes. Departments like English and Economics form some decks. Others correspond to the professional schools, such as HLS and HMS.  Reshuffle these decks, and allow the faculty to form new groupings based on what they currently regard as their strongest and most exciting affinities. What is the likelihood that they will sort themselves into the original departments and schools?To answer this, we need some history. Today’s departments didn’t always exist in their current form. Most of them coalesced late in the nineteenth century, as many U.S. universities shed their religious underpinnings and picked up the German style of higher education. Departments, in turn, were linked to the emergence of modern disciplines. It’s easy to track the founding of disciplines. Just check the date of the major academic journals: the Political Science Quarterly (founded 1886), American Anthropologist (1888), The American Historical Review (1895), and so on. Departments were invented to house and administer the research and teaching profiles of the new disciplines.Fast-forward to the present. Now, in 2009, we’re operating within an intellectual structure that took shape more than a century ago. It’s a worthy and venerable old edifice, but definitely getting a bit creaky. The oddity of departmental existence struck me forcefully this year as I watched my three freshmen advisees grapple with the tough question of concentration choice. Some students, upon comparing their academic inclinations with the concentration offerings, are able to slide easily into a field. But others cannot, because the fit doesn’t seem right.Departments and schools are a necessary administrative device, and in some cases the original logic of disciplines and departments is powerful and worth preserving.  But as the recent restructurings of biology and anthropology have suggested, a century-old logic is not necessarily a logic that best promotes research, teaching, and inquiry. For many faculty, our current departments reflect only a part of our intellectual and teaching horizons. Much the same is true for our students, as I learned this year. So if the decks were reshuffled, wholly new departments might emerge: a department of evolutionary studies, say, or perhaps a department of cognition and neurobiology which would unite professors from the sciences with those involved in the arts and humanities. The possibilities are endless.The idea of reshuffling the decks has considerable appeal. But here’s the conundrum: the act of forming new institutions does not, ipso facto, solve the problem of institutional exhaustion. So rather than form new departments that would just calcify in their turn, we want a device that would allow us to fold in the hands every few years and reshuffle the decks. In point of fact, the world of research is already abuzz with ideas and devices for pulling faculty out of their departmental homes into temporary alliances with other disciplines. Centers like the Radcliffe Institute fund one-time-only interdisciplinary research seminars. Funding organizations provide research funds with sunset clauses, ensuring that collaborations end every few years. In the world of research, in short, there exist devices for reshuffling faculty. The time has come to bring this same philosophy to the world of teaching.Obviously, there has to be a certain amount of continuity in our courses and curricula. But not every facet of the curriculum has to be imagined as permanent. For example, why not create a rolling series of secondary fields each with built-in sunset clauses, lasting no more than three or four years? These fields could be organized around a set of innovative, one-time-only freshmen seminars, Gen Ed courses, and departmental courses, each targeting a problem that energizes faculty and students alike. Courses could even be linked to short-term interdisciplinary and cross-faculty research projects. If a field lingered beyond its days as a secondary field, fine. But a lot of us would be just as happy to learn and move on. Even within existing departments, courses and curricula do not have to aim for permanence. I could easily imagine a small group of faculty in my department joining together to offer temporary tracks or plans of study centered on powerful themes—human rights, the deep history of slavery, economic catastrophes—that take form as courses, seminars, public lectures, and even thesis projects. We already shuffle our decks repeatedly in pursuit of new research initiatives. Can’t we do the same for our courses and curricula? Daniel L. Smail is Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies of History at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As members of the Class of 2009 preparing to leave Harvard, it is fairly natural for us to reflect upon our four years within these walls.  We ask whether it was worth the money and the time.  What is the purpose of a good education?  How do we hope to apply the knowledge we have gained here?
In recent weeks, America—or at least its punditocracy—has also reflected upon the early days of the Obama administration, and asked similar questions.  What have we learned?  What can we expect for the future?
I have always felt that the mark of a good education is its capacity to raise more questions than it answers.  Harvard opens our minds, broadens our outlook, and inspires our curiosity.  Where once we might have been content to ask and answer a question such as, “Does global warming exist?”, today we question the merits of so-called “clean coal,” debate the costs of a gas tax vs. a cap-and-trade system, and view “organic” labels with healthy skepticism.  Each broad question engenders a myriad of other smaller yet similarly critical ones.  
After our years here, many of us actually take solace in the Socrates maxim: “The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.”  In writing a 147-page thesis, I still barely scratched the surface of my field of study.  Yet the very fact that I realize this is oddly comforting: Perhaps this place has taught me well.
However, there is another equally important facet to this definition of wisdom.  My hope for the future of this class is that when we do arrive at an answer we believe is correct, we will have the courage to fight tooth-and-nail to defend it.  Whether some of us believe abortion is wrong or gay marriage is right, and whether an employer makes sexist remarks or a school restricts students’ freedom of speech, we should never be afraid to use our voice and our privileged position to make a change or, at the very least, make some noise.
For our presidents, achieving the right balance between asking questions and defending answers has been crucial.  President William J. Clinton was incredibly bright and intellectually curious.  There was not a decision he made without first considering numerous questions.  Yet, when it came down to questions of moral fortitude, perhaps where public opinion was opposed or indifferent to an issue, Clinton did not defend his answers.  Too often, on questions such as whether gays should serve openly in the military or whether the U.S. should intervene in Rwanda, he surrendered to the prevailing political winds, to the detriment of our nation.
The pendulum between questions and answers swung the other way when President George W. Bush took office.  This was not an intellectually curious man (though not dumb), and consequently it was not surprising that when a small circle of advisors advocated a certain course of action, Bush did not seek opposing viewpoints or consider all of the questions necessary to arrive at the right answer.  When he felt he had an answer, however, Bush defended that answer with great conviction.  He was “the decider,” and while you might not have agreed with where he stood, you always knew where that was.
Clinton and Bush represent, to a certain extent, extremes on a continuum.  It is the hope of many in this nation to see President Barack H. Obama occupy a middle ground, embodying a healthy marriage of curiosity and conviction.  The administration’s decision to make sweeping changes to the federal budget suggested a vigorous defense of an answer he gave on the campaign trail.  But other moves, such as the recent nomination of Judge Sonia M. Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, whom most legal analysts do not consider a liberal intellectual heavyweight to counter Justice Antonin G. Scalia, or the decision to delay repealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, suggest Clintonian moderation.  I retain great hopes for the next four (or eight) years of this White House.  Alexander Hamilton famously said, “Those who stand for nothing fall for anything,” and I believe that Obama will continue to stand up and to stand for the right answers.
Yet I hold even higher hopes for the ability of this year’s graduating class to pause, reflect, and consider the world around us.  The great, albeit fictional, President Josiah Bartlet once described his job saying, “Every once in a while there’s a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong…other than that, there aren’t very many un-nuanced moments in leading a country….”  It is a testament to our education that we do understand nuance, embrace complexity, and savor intellectual challenge. 
We will ask the right questions and we will vigorously defend the right answers, and in so doing, we will fulfill Harvard’s promise.  Congratulations to my fellow classmates and good luck!

Carried away by the throbbing Italian voice that filled the entire Bastille Opera house and hung quivering in the air, I forgot for a moment to pay any attention to the French subtitles displayed over the magnificent stage. When the voice died away and the silence was finally broken by thunderous applause and the oddly restrained enthusiasm of “Bravo! Bravo!”, I joined in and clapped till my palms stung, only noting (with a laugh to Thibaud) the absence of any American cheering or whistles. I was studying abroad in France at École Polytechnique and having the time of my life, exploring new interests and widening my horizons.
École Polytechnique was established in 1794, five years after the furies of revolution toppled Louis XVI and his queen Marie Antoinette from the French throne. Eleven years later, under Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, it became a military academy. Now, although its students still attend formals in uniform, it is the number one school in France, and grooms leaders for careers in science, business, and politics. Former President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing is a Polytechnicien, as were auto baron André Citroën and scientists Siméon Poisson, Augustin Fresnel, Henri Becquerel, and Henri Pointcaré. Each year, the top five hundred science and economics students in France join the community in Palaiseau, and after graduation, they continue on to the upper echelons of institutions across Europe. 
As a military and science school, Polytechnique has a slightly uneven gender ratio—9:1—and I received a very warm welcome. But not only were the students friendly and eager to include me in their activities and campus life, the administration also went out of its way to make sure that matters went smoothly, picking me up from the Metro when I first arrived and even helping me arrange an independent internship alongside my classes. 
Over the course of my five-month stay, I was able to attend operas in Paris, join the fencing team, take horseback riding lessons, visit Germany and Spain, and spend hours wandering around the woods near the campus engaged in heady philosophical conversations in French. Since returning, I have found that my life here is much richer for the experience and that thanks to having studied abroad, I have been able to take much better advantage of the opportunities offered at Harvard. 
In the hustle and bustle of Cambridge life, classes, and exams, it’s easy to let the urgent squeeze out the important. In France, I was deliberately given very nice classes, such that I had time to start exploring spontaneity and life outside of the problem set. One week, I decided—at the last minute—to attend a talk by President Sarkozy on affirmative action. Another time I restructured my afternoon in order to listen to former President Giscard D’Estaing speak on the European Union.
Despite my taking on an intense class load again this semester, this flexibility carried over and has enabled me to make the most of my time since returning to Harvard. I’ve begun to take time to glance over the house list and to read over emails of upcoming IOP events, and despite assignments, I’ve rescheduled my day in order to go see General Petreaus speak on Iraq, to see Shakespeare’s Hamlet, to enjoy a live bluegrass band, and to take advantage of senior thesis talks and half-price student tickets to Don Giovanni in Boston. 
My time in France gave me a broader perspective on culture and globalization. Besides developing a lively appreciation of most things French—cheese, fashion, their high regard for reason, their enjoyment of life—I also began to realize just how American I actually am. At home, it’s easy to be struck more by the plethora of differences between myself and my fellow citizens, but while abroad it came home to me how much I like the confident, rough and tumble, self-made, “can-do” attitude that’s part of the United States. Is this confidence a little arrogant? Probably. But it’s charming, too. Very. 
Besides gaining a broader understanding of cultural differences, I had hands-on experience with international networking. Towards the end of the winter, École Polytechnique invites about a hundred of the most important companies in Europe to campus for their yearly job fair. I was able to interact with recruiters from over a dozen different firms, and many of these asked for a copy of my resume and that I keep in touch. Although I had scarcely given the option any serious thought prior to my time abroad, it is now more probable than not that I will end up working in Europe for a while after graduation.
These are just of a few of the ways that study abroad can give you a richer experience at Harvard and broaden your perspective on life—besides, of course, giving you the chance to develop wonderful memories and friends across the Atlantic.  I would strongly recommend a stint overseas to any of my friends—science concentrators like myself or otherwise.  So, if you are ever given the opportunity to spend some time at École Polytechnique, absolutely don’t hesitate to do so.  And if you do, please bring me back some cheese.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all the venerable Harvard institutions, the Administrative Board of Harvard College likely holds the distinction of engendering the most anxiety among students.  The Board, composed of resident deans, faculty, and administrators, applies faculty rules in regard to undergraduate education and conduct. Critics of the Board argue that its procedures are obscure, that it is inadequately supportive and representative of students, and that encounters with it can be downright terrifying. After 18 months of reviewing the Board, we have proposed modifications that will make the Board’s actions more transparent, increase student support, and improve the educational work of the Board.  We commend Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, who—amid an unprecedented budget crisis—has come down firmly on the side of instituting changes, many of which are outlined below and will take effect next year.  Many students facing Board sanctions feel inadequately supported.  To help students and to allow the resident deans to offer support, the Secretary of the Board, or a designee— rather than the student’s resident dean— will notify a student that a case has been initiated. This allows the resident dean to act more strictly as an advisor.  If a student would like an alternative advisor, they may choose another Board member.  Also—as is the case now—a student may pick a personal advisor from within the FAS.  Under the newly adopted procedures, this advisor will receive information and briefings on the Board process, be permitted to pause Board proceedings during a personal appearance if a student needs a break, and be permitted to voice relevant information if a student omits pertinent details.With a board composed of 33 members, personal appearances—allowed when students may be required to withdraw—are difficult for everyone involved, and some students find it hard to coherently state their case. Next year, instead of appearing before the full Board, students will meet with a subcommittee of approximately six Board members. In this less intimidating setting, information can be more easily exchanged, lessons can be learned, and students can interact directly with board members.  Additionally, in a smaller and more private location than the Forum room of Lamont Library—currently the venue for these appearances—students won’t have to explain to curious friends in the Lamont Café, exposed to the rest of the student body, that they are formally dressed and upset because they are to attend an Ad Board hearing. Hammonds will increase faculty representation on the Board.  The rules governing student conduct are faculty rules—formulated and legislated by the faculty—and therefore faculty must take a greater role in their application. The review committee has suggested that in deciding a case, and when voting, a Board member must be “sufficiently persuaded” that a student has violated a rule of the faculty.  This is intended to increase transparency and make clear that cases are decided based on a previously agreed standard.  At the same time, to help document a case, and to help assure fairness, students involved in disciplinary cases will be asked to submit to the Board a list of relevant information. Hammonds has reemphasized the importance of handling minor matters within the Houses, and next year, they will be urged to issue warnings in response to minor offenses that occur within them.  Evidently, the Board is sometimes used as a threat when local sanctions might be more effective. For example, if a student propped her door, it could be handled within the House and would not require the Board.  Hammonds has also committed to making the sequence of events for cases more clear, whether through flow charts or through revised and simplified guides.  Across the College, there is a commitment to assuring that students and faculty understand the process and the rationale for the Board. Next fall, we expect legislation to be presented to the faculty for discussion and votes.  Among the revisions will be changes to the rules on academic misconduct, including collaboration, and expanded sanctions in such cases.  All of these changes aim to enhance the academic and educational aspects of life in the classroom and to capture the “teaching moments.” Further legislation will be required to implement the committee’s suggestion to change processes regarding votes for the dismissal of a student and how appeals are heard. These new recommendations place the responsibility with the Faculty Council and its Docket Committee.  The full faculty currently hears dismissal cases, but for reasons of privacy, it is not feasible to distribute supporting documents to all voting members—700–800 people.  The committee has recommended that cases of dismissal should be delegated to the Faculty Council, rather than the full faculty.  There are other issues that need further consideration before changes are implemented.  These concern the ways in which students might become involved in the disciplinary process and ways in which the roles and service of the resident deans might be strengthened. Ultimately, as a committee, as students, and as faculty, we appreciate the role of the Board in our academic and social community.  It is here—perhaps as nowhere else—that our common goals are brought together. The recommendations will diminish the mystery surrounding the Board, and the fear and sometimes terror students feel.  With such changes afoot, we might look forward to the full engagement of students, faculty, resident deans, and administrators in the challenging work of the Administrative Board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent meeting between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu generated speculation over the future relationship between America and Israel, and a potentially changed U.S. policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Analysts on the right and left are commenting on a new, tougher American policy characterized by strengthened U.S. demands on Israel.  However, beneath the diplomatic choreography lies an agonizing reality that received only brief comment from Obama and silence from Netanyahu: The ongoing devastation of the people of Gaza.
Gaza is an example of a society that has been deliberately reduced to a state of abject destitution, its once productive population transformed into one of aid-dependent paupers.  This context is undeniably one of mass suffering, created largely by Israel but with the active complicity of the international community, especially the U.S. and European Union, and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Gaza’s subjection began long before Israel’s recent war against it..  The Israeli occupation—now largely forgotten or denied by the international community—has devastated Gaza’s economy and people, especially since 2006. Although economic restrictions actually increased before Hamas’ electoral victory in January 2006, the deepened sanction regime and siege subsequently imposed by Israel and the international community, and later intensified in June 2007 when Hamas seized control of Gaza, has all but destroyed the local economy.  If there has been a pronounced theme among the many Palestinians, Israelis, and internationals who I have interviewed in the last three years, it was the fear of damage to Gaza’s society and economy so profound that billions of dollars and generations of people would be required to address it—a fear that has now been realized.
After Israel’s December assault, Gaza’s already compromised conditions have become virtually unlivable.  Livelihoods, homes, and public infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed on a scale that even the Israel Defense Forces admitted was indefensible. In Gaza today, there is no private sector to speak of and no industry. 80 percent of Gaza’s agricultural crops were destroyed and Israel continues to snipe at farmers attempting to plant and tend fields near the well-fenced and patrolled border. Most productive activity has been extinguished.
One powerful expression of Gaza’s economic demise—and the Gazans’ indomitable will to provide for themselves and their families—is its burgeoning tunnel economy that emerged long ago in response to the siege. Thousands of Palestinians are now employed digging tunnels into Egypt—around 1,000 tunnels are reported to exist although not all are operational. According to local economists, 90 percent of economic activity in Gaza—once considered a lower middle-income economy (along with the West Bank)—is presently devoted to smuggling.
Today, 96 percent of Gaza’s population of 1.4 million is dependent on humanitarian aid for basic needs. According to the World Food Programme, the Gaza Strip requires a minimum of 400 trucks of food every day just to meet the basic nutritional needs of the population. Yet, despite a 22 March decision by the Israeli cabinet to lift all restrictions on foodstuffs entering Gaza, only 653 trucks of food and other supplies were allowed entry during the week of May 10, at best meeting 23 percent of required need.
Israel now allows only 30 to 40 commercial items to enter Gaza compared to 4,000 approved products prior to June 2006.  According to the Israeli journalist, Amira Hass, Gazans still are denied many commodities (a policy in effect long before the December assault): Building materials (including wood for windows and doors), electrical appliances (such as refrigerators and washing machines), spare parts for cars and machines, fabrics, threads, needles, candles, matches, mattresses, sheets, blankets, cutlery, crockery, cups, glasses, musical instruments, books, tea, coffee, sausages, semolina, chocolate, sesame seeds, nuts, milk products in large packages, most baking products, light bulbs, crayons, clothing, and shoes.
Given these constraints, among many others—including the internal disarray of the Palestinian leadership—one wonders how the reconstruction to which Obama referred will be possible. There is no question that people must be helped immediately. Programs aimed at alleviating suffering and reinstating some semblance of normalcy are ongoing, but at a scale shaped entirely by the extreme limitations on the availability of goods. In this context of repressive occupation and heightened restriction, what does it mean to reconstruct Gaza? How is it possible under such conditions to empower people and build sustainable and resilient institutions able to withstand expected external shocks? Without an immediate end to Israel’s blockade and the resumption of trade and the movement of people outside the prison that Gaza has long been, the current crisis will grow massively more acute.  Unless the U.S. administration is willing to exert real pressure on Israel for implementation—and the indications thus far suggest they are not—little will change.  Not surprisingly, despite international pledges of $5.2 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction, Palestinians there are now rebuilding their homes using mud.
Recently, I spoke with some friends in Gaza and the conversations were profoundly disturbing.  My friends spoke of the deeply felt absence of any source of protection—personal, communal or institutional.  There is little in society that possesses legitimacy and there is a fading consensus on rules and an eroding understanding of what they are for.  Trauma and grief overwhelm the landscape despite expressions of resilience. The feeling of abandonment among people appears complete, understood perhaps in their growing inability to identify with any sense of possibility. The most striking was this comment: “It is no longer the occupation or even the war that consumes us but the realization of our own irrelevance.”
What possible benefit can be derived from an increasingly impoverished, unhealthy, densely crowded, and furious Gaza alongside Israel?  Gaza’s terrible injustice not only threatens Israeli and regional security,  but it undermines America’s credibility, alienating our claim to democratic practice and the rule of law.
If Palestinians are continually denied what we want and demand for ourselves—an ordinary life, dignity, livelihood, safety, and a place where they can raise their children—and are forced, yet again, to face the destruction of their families, then the inevitable outcome will be greater and more extreme violence across all factions, both old and increasingly new. What looms is no less than the loss of entire generation of Palestinians. And if this happens—perhaps it already has—we shall all bear the cost.

Every once in a while I feel obliged to do my alma mater Fair Harvard a favor by showing the world that not everyone here is morally naïve and politically correct. I am grateful to The Crimson for providing the opportunity and wish only that Harvard’s faculty and administration were as diverse politically as it is.Nonetheless, I begin from a recent Crimson editorial deploring the loss of America’s international reputation under the Bush administration. Reputation for what? I ask. A reputation for being agreeable and nice, or for acting strongly and successfully? No foreign policy move so far of President Obama has done more for our reputation than ordering the very humane shooting, with no interrogation, of three pirates. The Bush administration certainly lost its reputation, as we saw clearly in the elections of 2006 and 2008. The administration’s opponents, who did their utmost to drag it down, now point to the result with unconcealed satisfaction, as if they were little innocents in the matter. But I do not believe that the American electorate turned against President Bush merely because they were misled by his opponents. They were misled by their own judgment. They thought him incompetent for starting an unnecessary war and then losing it; the problem was not that he acted illegally or wasn’t nice. In its impatience the electorate underestimated Bush’s determination and the resourcefulness of the American military. By the time the surge had brought victory in Iraq, the American people had made up their minds, and with Bush-like stubbornness, weren’t about to admit that they had been wrong.Perhaps this analysis shows too much relish for successful violence and underestimates the power of goodness. I do not want to be dismissive of “American values.” But, again, what are they? It seems clear that both rule of law and strong executive power are American values because both are settled in our attitudes. Our country favors “due process” in almost everything and believes in the rule of law even to the point of excessive legalism. But we are also a “can do” country that wants results, is always ready to cut through formalities, and often calls its official philosophy pragmatism. These American values are in conflict but we hold them both nevertheless, as can be seen in our Constitution.Let us look at the basics of the Constitution with a view to recent controversy. It is often said that the Constitution establishes the rule of law, and that is true, but only in a way. It also establishes a strong executive power, with a president elected by the people separately from Congress and with powers extending well beyond mere execution of the laws. America is the first republic to have a strong executive and much of its success is due to it. A strong executive looks like one-man rule, the very monarchy against which republics have always contested; its danger is obvious to partisans of republics and that is why before our Constitution, republics used to have weak executives.Yet the rule of law also has defects less obvious to us. Suppose the law is bad, then the rule of law is the rule of bad law. Think of the law requiring Rosa Parks to sit in the back of the bus. And a good law, meaning good in normal circumstances, may not be good in an emergency, when the country is at war or under attack. It may not even be good in a special case in ordinary times; this defect requires what used to be called equity and is now called “empathy.”  Moreover, when executing the law it is not enough to say “pretty please”—violence is sometimes necessary. Necessary: the executive deals especially with necessity as distinct from desirability.Now the Constitution contains both the desirable and the necessary; it maintains the rule of law through Congress and the Supreme Court, and it provides for extra-legal necessity in the executive. Because the Constitution is a law, a law above ordinary law, it gives its blessing to executive power that goes beyond ordinary law but remains under the Constitution. In this way the extra-legal becomes constitutionally legal.How do we know when to follow the rule of law and when not? The Constitution gives no answer valid for all circumstances but instead, through the separation of powers, sets up a debate between the three branches of government, each of which has its typical argument against the other two. Congress, whether Democratic or Republican, tends to support the rule of law—after all, it makes the laws. The President—and there have been strong Presidents in both parties—tends to see the defects of law, since law is always easier to make than apply. Sometimes the President wins, as did Bush in 2004; sometimes he loses, as did Bush in 2008.The Constitution intends that this debate never end, and it is naïve to think that one side should always win. But most of the naïveté is on the side of the rule of law, whose temporary supporters today are willing to shoot amateur pirates but not rough up far more dangerous terrorists at Guantanamo.Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of the year in education was centered on President Barack Obama’s agenda for higher and lower education. Any presidential turnover brings a host of fresh policies, but Obama’s were of special interest because of the high quality of governance promised by his administration. We supported most of his proposals, but noted the omission of several key reforms in higher education.  We also expressed concern at the federal government’s inadequate response to the economic crisis’ effects on the Boston school system. Closer to campus, we lamented the continuing distortion of the SAT and its results and hoped that other universities would follow our lead and increase the percentage of their aid that is need-based. We noted several local debates in lower education that may hold greater significance in the future.
We praised Obama both for the educational component of his budget plan and his projected reforms for the public education system. Obama singled out education as a special priority that will not be compromised even as the administration plans to cut the federal budget deficit in half by 2013. While the federal government must exercise more fiscal responsibility in the coming years, it serves no one to have this cost-cutting come at the expense of the country’s future labor force. Obama’s budget also proposes to make student loans available directly from the government, providing a much-needed alternative to the scandal-plagued student loan industry. It makes sense for a disinterested lender like the federal government to help out college students who might otherwise fall victim to predatory loan agencies. 
In conjunction with these plans, Obama announced a set of public education reforms in March 2009 that are bold and innovative. His proposal to lift limits on charter schools will provide students in failing school districts with a viable alternative and put pressure on the public schools in such districts to improve.  As Obama has stated, charter schools are important “laboratories of innovation” and cities such as New York and Los Angeles have seen marked improvements in public education due to their proliferation.
The reforms also included a plan to introduce merit pay in up to 150 school districts. Merit pay incentivizes good teaching and has great potential to improve underperforming schools. In many professions, a higher level of performance is rewarded with a higher level of pay, and teaching should be no exception. New York City’s Chancellor of Schools, Joel I. Klein, has already instituted a modified version of merit pay: The district gave $14.2 million in bonuses to schools that improved their performance in the 2007-2008 school year. A more effective system would be a hybrid model in which school-wide bonuses were complemented by rewards to individual teachers based on evaluation of their teacher, but Klein’s program is a step in the right direction.
Nevertheless, although we approved of the general direction of Obama’s educational policy, we were disappointed by the omission of several important reforms. To ease the burden of financing a college education, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid should be simplified. At over 100 questions long, the structure of the FAFSA is unnecessarily complicated and turns what is supposed to be a helpful tool into an exercise in frustration. Additionally, laws governing H1B visas should be revised so that all gainfully employed international students can stay and work in the United States after graduation. In today’s competitive global environment it would be a mistake for America to lose talented, enthusiastic workers to other countries because of xenophobic fears or excessive red tape. Furthermore, in a matter of more local concern, we hope that the federal government will assist the Boston public school system in its present hour of need. This year, the district will cut 900 positions, 403 of which are teaching jobs. As a result, class sizes will likely increase and students will get less attention. Federal assistance is needed, and at the very least, Congress should refrain from cutting federal funding for state aid that could be used to shore up school districts.

Outside of the public sphere, we deplored the continued distortion and misuse of the SAT. The College Board’s implementation of the new “Score Choice” policy, which allows students to determine which of their SAT scores will be sent to colleges, was a particularly disappointing choice. Allowing for the opportunity to take the test multiple times consequence-free gives wealthier students an edge, as they tend to be the ones who can afford the time and money to do so. It puts further emphasis on an already overemphasized test. Just this past September, a committee chaired by Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 declared the SAT an incomplete gauge of a student’s college-readiness and we wholeheartedly concurred. Then, upon learning that Baylor University had recently paid almost 900 incoming freshman to retake the SATs in an effort to raise the school’s US News & World Report ranking, we denounced this standardized test-gerrymandering as toxic.  Unfortunately, this type of behavior is merely a distasteful product of an unhealthy and unwarranted cultural emphasis on test scores.
Universities should focus their attention instead on the growing financial needs of their enrolled student body. In response to the recession, many schools are anticipating significant tuition increases, but we believe that this is an ill-advised move, given that it decreases college affordability. Merit-based and athletic scholarships should be scaled back in order for schools to focus on need-based financial aid, which should be the clear priority in this difficult economic climate.
Lastly, turning to local matters, this year we commented on several local debates that hold greater significance for the national educational scene. Several public schools made moves to introduce school uniforms this year. Although such an imposition may appear to be in violation of the spirit of free expression, we believe that the benefits of uniforms on school atmosphere and attendance warrant this move. Support for this position can be found in Hartford, Connecticut, which has required its public school students to wear uniforms and has since seen a marked increase in the number of students taking the SATs and investing in their futures.
This year, members of the education establishment questioned the wisdom of using interactive games to teach literacy. Although the introduction of digital mediums of reading may signal the death of the printed tome, we posited that literacy efforts are only effective if they connect with students. These games seem to do this and they should therefore be welcomed as a valuable tool for literacy education. We might have liked to see a similar generational medium enthuse math education in America as we lamented the dismal perception of the subject among America’s youth, and hoped that the field might become more popular and valued in our culture. The U.S. has shamefully low standards for math education, but more widespread introduction of fun math extracurricular activities and more rigorous math curriculums might change this.
Education is the bedrock of a successful nation, and thus it is not surprising that the issues surrounding it have generated strong opinions and healthy debate.  But with a new president who pledges to make these issues a priority for his administration and so many individuals who care about ensuring that students get the most out of their schools, one might say that the future of education looks rather bright.

Few would deny that Harvard is a pretty darn cerebral place.  As we’re so often reminded, it’s America’s oldest college, home to Nobel-prize winning faculty and students who are the country’s best and brightest.  In thinking about my past four years here, then, it strikes me as a bit odd that they seem altogether less academic than my high school years.  Don’t get me wrong—I’ve taken Ec10 and read Milton—but the lessons that I learned from Mankiw and Teskey are inextricably intertwined with more personal ones.   My classmate Edward Robinson ’09 summarized my feelings exactly when he said to me yesterday: “I expected freshman year that Harvard would make me superhuman; instead, it's just humanized me.”  
Quantitative Reasoning 38 (“Game Theory”)—and friendships—have taught me to play tit for tat, with forgiveness built in.  I’ve learned that it’s not a good idea to throw dishware unless someone else started it, and every now and then, to take out the trash even when it’s not my turn.  I’ve learned that giving or getting flowers can start cycles of cooperation that benefit everybody.
Philip J. Fisher’s class on Aestheticism and Modernism—and reading period—have taught me the importance of a sense of playfulness.  I’ve learned that there are two approaches to a T minus 24-hours sense of panic: partaking in a dining hall arms race (“Only two papers?  Try three.”) and snapping at strangers, or slowing down, taking my computer to Café Algiers, and appreciating January’s new fallen snow.
QR20 (“Computers and Computing”)—and graduating—have taught me that happiness demands being bold enough to do things badly.  
I’ve learned that no matter how crackpot or distant a goal may seem, taking the first step toward realizing it always feels right.  At Harvard, I’ve often found that many things that may seem like poor choices or wastes of time on a résumé—leaving for a semester to study abroad, starting to play guitar, taking computer programming, not participating in e-recruiting—were unquestionably the right choices for me and have actually helped make me the person who I want to be.  I came into Harvard not used to being bad at things, but I’ve realized that being a novice, or an absent-minded daydreamer, is the first step toward becoming an expert and realizing one’s potential.In Shakespeare’s play, The Tempest, the character Miranda’s exclamation, “O, wonder! / How many goodly creatures are there here! / How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, / That has such people in't!” is widely regarded as proof of her naiveté.  I, however, today on Class Day, cannot help but echo her words.  Here, the more that I’ve learned, and the more that I’ve lived, the more that I’m left in wonder at the interconnectedness of things, and the beauty around me.  
While this lesson may not immediately help me to find gainful employment, it gives me an inner peace that I know I will carry with me from job to job, from city to city, and from decade to decade.  Looking back at college, I could not have hoped for a better education, and I leave Harvard, above all else, with gratitude.

The phone call came in the middle of March.With the bulk of senior year behind me, and the distance between the present and the future shrinking by the day, I readied myself for a call like this, double-checking the red phone in our room, clearing hours for uninterrupted waiting-by-the-phone time.Sitting in the Adams House dining hall, I was two days away from handing in my thesis, and the screen of my phone lit up. Just as I planned, and what good timing. A 212 area code. Even though the past year has bruised New York City, the number rang with promise. A person in a New York office building was calling me. The digits ended in a round number. Probably a very big office building. An important person who worked in a big Manhattan office building wanted to talk. This person could see great stretches of earth and sky from where he sat, and surveying all that landscape, had wisely decided to call me. The assembled members of the Adams family, their portraits hanging on the room’s walls, looked on approvingly.I was looking for a job in journalism and knew that there were still a few media companies in New York City hiring. Not newspapers, of course. But news was still coming out of New York, and maybe someone wanted me to help cover it.The man on the other end of the phone said he was from a news Web site—one that I recognized. He told me that someone from The Crimson had given him my name. The Mountain was coming to me! After months of sweaty-palmed interviews and unnoticed cover letters, my hard work in the minor leagues of journalism was finally about to pay off.Before you fault me for a certain brand of Harvard bubble-dwelling—they don’t just give jobs out!—you should know that they once really did. There’s a well-worn story told at The Crimson about a wealthy magazine owner cold-calling the newsroom a few years ago and asking for recruits. Give me your name, and I’ll give you a job. Couldn’t have been easier. It was a foot in the door that served at least a couple young writers quite well.Here was my chance. The reporter had been given my number. Good. Been told I was the right person to talk to. Well, of course. He was writing a story. Oh. About The Crimson. I see. About how Crimson editors weren’t going into journalism any more. Gulp.I had spent nearly four years in a newsroom without direct sunlight, worked summers at a newspaper and a magazine, done all the right things, I thought, to lead me to this moment. Someone would call, offer me a job, and I would be on my way. But when the call came, I was being told, quite simply, that there was no way. I suppose being handed your obituary is difficult at any age. It turns out twenty-three is no exception. For the members of the Class of 2009, whether wannabe journalists or not, failure has become the new success. “The dirty secret is out. Harvard students fail sometimes,” The Boston Globe told us this April, breaking the story wide open.Of course, The Globe is in an expert position to judge failure these days. But you’ll find no schadenfreude here, since, as the voice from the Manhattan newsroom reminded me, their failures lead to my own.What to do when you graduate into a world that seems completely different from the one you prepared for?  It was good to have a few members of the Adams family near by; at least Henry could offer comfort. The Harvard historian’s generation slouched into the twentieth century with the same bewilderment with which we face ours, also feeling trained for an era that looked nothing like his own.“Only in 1900,” Adams wrote famously, “the continuity snapped.” Only in September 2008, it did again, or so we’ve been told. Like the September seven years before, this one is said to have changed everything. That snapping sensation was almost certainly louder for ears tuned to a specific frequency—those of a graduating senior alert to any sounds of change. I was hearing it again in a phone call from Manhattan.The reporter had his story—some people were still reporting—but the story was, in short, that after 135 years of graduating Crimson editors populating the ranks of young journalists, our class marked the end in another continuity. It is far safer, particularly these days, to predict a bust than a boom. Valleys all around without a peak to be seen.Peak time, if you ask me, to be beginning. Certainly, someone will be needed to call members of the Class of 2019 and tell them their future is over too.Samuel P. Jacobs ‘09, a former Crimson associate managing editor, is a history concentrator in Adams House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The question is familiar, inevitable, and universal. It arises from your uncles at Thanksgiving, from your high school classmates that you run into when you are back home buying dental floss, and from every member of the opposite sex that you meet in a bar once they figure out what “a school in Boston” means:
“So, what is Harvard like?”
Most of us who face this question have developed a pre-packaged answer. For a while mine was, “Well, we don’t have intro accounting yet, and I imagine it’ll be years before we finally get an Ag department.” And more recently I’ve commented, “It’s like a pyramid scheme. They say it’s a good investment, but first you have to give them a lot of money and make sure other people also sign up after you leave.” Yet, despite how cute and creative the responses are, they only serve as a red herring to divert attention from the name and idea of Harvard.
Harvard as Harvard, of course, is an impolite topic of conversation, much like asking about a parent’s salary or someone’s racial composition. While the topic may drift up in the first few weeks of freshman year, it is quickly squashed by the monotony of concentration, secondary, citation, and Core credits and the erratic drive to build the old resume. Yet, periodically, the idea resurfaces. Most of the time, it’s in the form of a complaint as in, “Why the hell are they cutting hot breakfast? This is Harvard,” or “Why haven’t they fired the Dean of the College who sends asinine emails about the nuances of shuttle committee proceedings but doesn’t care to notify us about the drug-related dormitory murders occurring while she is sending out her asinine emails?”
Although the complaints are useful in shaming University Hall out of its more draconian antics, there are more important times when the idea of Harvard as Harvard surfaces in the mind. It’s during solitary moments when, despite the desire for humility and the claims of disillusionment, the mythology of this place overtakes one. For me, it happened one day when I was walking through the snow-covered yard and I realized that, sometime in the past three hundred years, someone whose name I learned in elementary school probably walked roughly the same path—and probably was also late.
At those moments, this place becomes more than bricks and coursepacks but rather something that is only tangible in the shared experiences. The Asian tourists posing for pictures in front of your entryway door or snapping pictures of your flabby pale self running Primal Scream, the professor who is interviewed on TV as an expert although you fell asleep in half his lectures, or the President of Mongolia’s security detail pushes you aside in the yard so the President’s unwashed hand can touch John’s unwashed bronze shoe. From the shared experiences like these, we have the moments when we recognize that our college is slightly unique from others.
I am convinced it is those moments that cause me and most of my fellow classmates to avoid the “What is Harvard like?” question, because the moments are both indescribable and unnerving. Last night, while I was emptying from my bookshelf all the unfinished readings I still had from my freshman seminar, I experienced the feeling again when I realized that my bookshelf will hold the unfinished coursework of many more students.
The crux is that Harvard was here before all of us and is likely to remain, when all that is remembered of any of us is the footnote written by a history concentrator who is trying to win a Hoopes Prize by digging up obscure minutiae. While we pass through and change, the college does not. The dorms will be filled with other students having their own love triangles. The UC will continue to amend its constitution. The faculty will reach a new revolutionary way to teach general education that looks like all the past programs. The senior thesis writers will escape to the same bars for the same drinks. And the Lowell House bells, though new, will continue to wake up anyone who has slept in past one.
The realization that we are not the culmination of history but rather a midpoint in the institution’s grand goal of apparently purchasing all the land in Massachusetts is what makes the idea of Harvard as Harvard unsettling. It begs us to question what our use or purpose is because, in the face of 5,000 years, earning power or money here and now seems rather pointless.
And while Harvard is an institution that wheels and deals in money and power, it is still in its heart an institution of knowledge. Knowledge that passed in whispers and parchment from generation to generation—incomplete only where it was neglected long enough for everyone who knew it to die off. The goal of a liberal arts education isn’t to get a sweet job from e-recruiting, but rather to teach each generation to be a bridge that passes the insights of humanity onto the next.
“So, what is Harvard like?”
To me, Harvard is like four years that will require the rest of my life to make sense of. It is the people and the stories, as well as the myth and the name. It is the realization that, just like Harvard is more than the sum of her students, what defines each of us is not just our individual selves, but also how we connect to the past and pass the better parts onto the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a brewing global debate about how best to address the system of racial apartheid in South Africa, Harvard’s graduating classes in the mid-1980s sought to bring the issue closer to home. Beginning with the class of 1983, graduating seniors created an alternative fund to the traditional senior gift called the Endowment for Divestiture in an effort to pressure the University to divest its endowment funds from companies doing business in South Africa—a call that echoed the United Nation’s similar recommendation.
Unlike a traditional senior gift, in which graduating seniors donate to the University to support programs at the College such as financial aid, this new fund would remain in escrow until either Harvard complied with the students’ demands or the United Nations lifted its call for divestiture.
After almost 400 seniors signed the petition in support of the fund, in April 1983 the Undergraduate Council approved
the creation of this alternative to the senior class’ traditional contribution.
According to Claude D. Convisser ’84, some seniors in the class of 1984 also chose to continue donating money to the fund in an effort to sustain pressure on the University to divest from South African companies.
“We’re not talking about a lot of money, but the hope was that it would call attention to the issue,” said Raine M. Figueroa ’84, Class Marshall.
“It would say ‘We’re the student body and we think your practices are unacceptable’.”
The withholding of this fund was one of many student responses to a larger moral quandary that had been contested on Harvard’s campus since a decade earlier.
CREATING AWARENESS
The issue of divestiture first arose as a major issue in the late 1970s when a group of students seized then President Derek C. Bok’s office in 1978 and later organized a torchlight procession through the streets of Cambridge to protest Harvard’s continued investment in South Africa. Approximately three thousand people participated in the torchlight parade, which was followed by a day-long blockade of University Hall. 
“College students tend to be among the first to take a stand on issues,” Figueroa said. “A lot of people were persuaded by the argument for divestiture.”
The University’s ownership of stock in companies that conducted business in South Africa and the country’s status as an apartheid state continued to stir debate on campus well into the 1980s and attracted national media attention.
An Op-Ed in The Crimson in September 1985 reported that the University held about $430 million in South Africa-related investments. This amounted to about 19 percent of the $2.3 billion endowment.
Convisser remembers five to ten thousand people attending a rally in Harvard Yard with civil rights activist and Reverend Jesse Jackson as the keynote speaker in the spring of 1985.
While this rally supported the divestiture movement, there was no counter rally at the time opposing their demands. Convisser said the first visible protests on the issue began in the mid seventies after the Vietnam War came to an end in 1975.
“For the class of ’84, we were old enough to recall and be aware of the anti-war movement in ’69,” he said “We
still had that consciousness that students can be active.”
But Convisser said that although there were students opposed to divestiture, there was no “acrimonious debate” on campus.
“There were certainly individual debates going on in the dining halls but no clash of protestors,” he said.
CLOSE TO VICTORY
The student-led push for Harvard to divest from companies doing business South Africa came amidst the country’s continued marginalization from the international community—South Africa had been barred from the General Assembly of the United Nations and was not allowed to participate in the Olympics. The South African government also faced other countries’ attempts to ban international trade with the state and it desperately needed loans from the International Monetary Fund.
Meanwhile, students at Harvard organized discussions, forums and protests to raise awareness and encourage divestiture from South Africa.
“There was a substantial number in the student body that felt passionately about it and I admired their conviction,” said Peter T. Gelfman ’85. “I think the movement was successful in raising awareness of the issue.”
One such event, a “Day of Dialogue” in December 1983, included over a hundred students in discussions on US involvement in the apartheid state. The idea of the event, which was cosponsored by the Harvard Race Relations Foundation, was first suggested during a hunger strike the previous spring to protest the University’s policy on divestiture. More than 19 undergrads and one professor fasted for a week to protest Harvard investments in South Africa. That same year, seniors established the Endowment for Divestiture, with the intention that Harvard would receive the money only when it divested. The end of the hunger strike in the spring of 1983 coincided with a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility (ACSR), comprised of students, faculty and alumni. The Harvard Corporation—the University’s governing body—controls Harvard’s investment portfolio, while the ACSR makes nonbinding
recommendations to the Corporation on ethical questions concerning Harvard’s investment policies.
It was becoming more apparent that students’ protests were having an unprecedented effect on the University’s investment policies.
Reports from the meeting published in the Crimson confirmed that committee members acknowledge that the group’s subsequent decisions were influenced by the actions of students who fasted in support of divestiture.
The ACSR recommended that the Corporation use the Sullivan Principles, which provided humane guidelines for the operation of companies in South Africa, as a minimum standard for the endowment’s investment practices. At the same time, in 1983, 37 of the 39 companies in which the University owned stock had signed the Principles, but some divestiture proponents argued that not all of the signatory companies had actually lived up to the document’s stipulations.
The ACSR held a public hearing early in 1984 to ascertain the opinions of members of the Harvard community before voting on the issue.
According to Convisser, who was elected by the UC as an undergraduate representative to the ASCR, several hundred people were in attendance.
After a decade of heated debate, protests and hunger strikes, in May 1984 the ACSR voted narrowly in favor of recommending unilateral divestiture from companies that conducted business in South Africa. However, Harvard did not completely divest based on the ACSR’s recommendations. Instead, the Corporation subsequently chose a policy of selective divestment, which led to Harvard withdrawing investments from 15 companies. The Corporation argued that complete divestiture could do more harm than good for already marginalized black South Africans.
Still, some considered the divestiture movement a success because it encouraged Harvard to recognize moral responsibility when making investments.
“The attention that this issue received at Harvard and other university campuses contributed to the divestiture movement entering the mainstream of American political and economic thought,” Convisser said. “Student activity on university campuses was a major factor in bringing it into mainstream thought.”
According to Convisser, the money from the fund was given to Harvard in 1994.
“Those of us who were advocating for Harvard’s change in its investment policy still felt great affection for Harvard and are pleased that all eventually became united on this issue,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One weekend in October 1983, Leverett House threw a party that almost everyone agreed was totally lame. There were never more than 25 people in the room at a time, A. Brent Truitt ’84, then Leverett House Committee Chairman, told The Crimson at the time.
“People came to the door with their money and asked ‘Where are the kegs?’ and we said ‘Go to Winthrop House.’ We turned away hundreds of people,” Truitt said in 1983.
Why no kegs? Since 1979, Harvard had banned alcohol at college-wide events as part of a policy spearheaded by then Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III. But enforcement was spotty, according to people who were students at the time.
By 1984, both Harvard administrators and the State of Mass. stepped their efforts to make alcohol less accessible on campuses. At Harvard, House Masters were now being forced to comply with the long-standing regulations banning alcohol at House or campus-wide events, and lobbying groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving succeeded in pushing through legislation in Dec. 1984 that raised the state’s drinking age from 18 to 21.
FROM THE STATE HOUSE...TO DUNSTER HOUSE
In 1972, 18 year-olds in Mass.—who since 1969 had been drafted to serve in the Vietnam War—were granted to the right to vote in federal elections and the right to drink in their home state.
But over the next decade, the Massachusetts state legislature tried to raise the drinking age to 20, but failed when Gov. Dukakis twice vetoed bills brought to his desk. Almost immediately after Edward J. King replaced Dukakis as governor in 1979, advocates of the change succeeded and the drinking age was raised to 20.
The College followed the State’s lead, implementing a slew of changes to a formerly lax alcohol policy. In the Spring of 1979 Epps and House Masters banned House happy hours, a relatively new institution where Houses served alcoholic beverages to all of their residents. Epps also issued revised guidelines that fall, banning alcohol from college-wide dances. In addition, liquor was only allowed at senior class functions, and would only be served to students 20 years or older who presented their IDs. To serve alcohol at private parties, students were required to buy temporary liquor and public entertainment licenses for $57, the equivalent of $166.93 in today’s currency.
When Dukakis returned to the governorship in 1983, he faced pressure to raise the drinking age still further in an effort to curtail drunk driving.
Over the next several years different Houses enforced college alcohol policies with varying degrees of strictness, according to several members of the class of 1984.
“I guess they weren’t carding very aggressively back then,” said Michelle M. Seery ’84, who added that the change in the drinking age did not have an impact on her life.
There was even a failed proposal in 1984 to ban alcoholic drinks larger than 16 oz., which, if passed, would have eliminated the Hong Kong’s 30oz. scorpion bowl—an ambiguous but eternally popular blend of liquor and juice.
“I would think if they raised the drinking age, [the Kong] would go out of business—no one over 21 would buy that,” said Hillary G. Tarazi ’84.
Several alumni remembered their Houses finding ways to get around the College’s drinking policy. Some said that House Masters would hold open houses where alcohol was served from 9 p.m. to midnight on Saturdays, while a alcohol-free party was occurring in another part of the House.
“I assumed that everyone who drank at house functions was of age,” said Reineir A. Cruz ’84, who was Adams House’s social committee chair.
But in 1983 the tides were turning again. In October, Governor Dukakis ordered an increase in the number of roadblocks in Boston and Cambridge in an attempt to reduce the number of drunk drivers. That same month, Dean Epps renewed the ban on alcohol at House functions. Then Assistant Dean of the College Thomas A. Dingman ’67 told The Crimson in 1983 that the announcement came in response to a perceived inconsistency in the way Houses enforced the alcohol policy.
EFFECT OF AN AGE
Despite the changes, a number of members of the class of 1984 said that they do not believe that increasing restrictions on alcohol during their last year of college reduced student drinking, though it may have meant that students drank more off campus.
“Overall the policy was probably a negative because it forced students away from more supervised gatherings into off campus ones,” said Robert A. Henderson ’84.
Several alumni—both those who said they drank in college and those who identified as non-drinkers—said that the change in the college policies and the drinking age did not affect their lives. Some were already 21 by the time the law took effect; others said they primarily drank at private parties where the hosts had apparently had no trouble acquiring liquor.
“Most of the drinking that I remember took place in dorms,” said Scott D. Segal ’84, “The drinking age was not exactly the major issue.”
But others said that the college’s alcohol policy had a forceful impact on House events.
“We were in a setting where there were things that the houses simply couldn’t do, that they’d been used to doing,” said Ari W. Epstein ’84, a former Dunster HoCo co-chair.
“The binge-drinking crowd is always going to find alcohol. But casual drinkers suddenly couldn’t have drinks at a party,” he added.
“It was really helpful, back when it was legal, that the college could officially be there when freshmen were drinking, to keep an eye on them,” Epstein said.
But there is no evidence that lowering the drinking age will result in healthier or safer drinking habits among young people, according to Harvard’s current Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, Ryan Travia.
Still, alumni did not remember any major fallout over the higher drinking age. Some alumni said that as far as they could recall, drugs were actually more prevalent on campus than alcohol in the early 1980s.
“It seemed like at that time the people who were enforcing the rules cared more about alcohol than about drugs,” Henderson said.
Robin Selinger ’84, who says she has never been much of a drinker, recalls being given a brownie on her birthday freshman year, which she only later realized was laced with marijuana.
“I called my mother and said ‘Help!’” she said. Her mother told her to sleep it off.

After last month’s announcement that late night shuttle service might be eliminated as part of a round of sweeping budget cuts, students erupted in protest, citing safety concerns that would arise if the decision were to go through. But a week later, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an e-mail to the undergraduate population announcing that, pending further inquiry, shuttles will continue to run after 1:30 a.m. from Sunday to Wednesday next year. However, the administration remained mum on cutbacks to daytime shuttle service.Hammonds and several College administrators faced intense criticism from students during a series of meetings, held on May 11, that administrators said aimed to increase transparency and incorporate student perspective as the University grapples with an unprecedented budget crisis.In the e-mail, Hammonds acknowledged the potential safety hazards that students had raised at the town hall meetings, but she also reaffirmed that the proposal came after a “thorough review of the safety implications”—a claim that both students and House officials saw as insufficient.According to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, slashing late-night shuttle services was one of the budget cuts that College administrators did not “flag” beforehand in anticipation of widespread student opposition. House administrators, including incoming Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis, said they were concerned that the potential cut, coupled with the closing of the Quad library next year, would disproportionately af“The decision to shut down the Quad library was shocking,” said Jen J. Gong ’12, who will live in Cabot House next year. “That, combined with the scaling-back of the shuttle service, was worrisome.”However, Gong said that she felt the College administration has been receptive to her and other students’ concerns in the e-mails administrators sent following the town hall meetings.  In the face of intense scrutiny for what students have equated with cuts that unequally target student life, administrators agreed that reconsidering their proposal to cut shuttle services was a “really important” move, according to Suzy M. Nelson, associate dean of residential life.“Instead of making a decision now, we really want to wait until folks get back in the fall,” Nelson said.   In the interim, Nelson said that the administration will look into the feasibility of alternatives to shuttles, including escort and van services, which Hammonds called currently “less than optimal” in her May 18 e-mail. —Staff writer Bita M.

Former Harvard Medical School Dean Daniel C. Tosteson ’46, whose reforms catalyzed a revolution in modern medical education around the world, died last Wednesday due to complications from a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. He was 84 years old.Tosteson held the deanship for 20 years from 1977 to 1997—a transformational period during which the Medical School overhauled its teaching methods, restructured its academic departments, and increased its endowment nearly ninefold.“He had all the necessary clarity and force of intellect, the capacity to lead and persuade, and the human qualities that inspire admiration,” said Neil L. Rudenstine, who was president of the University during the final years of Tosteson’s deanship. “I will personally miss him, and Harvard will certainly miss him.”Faculty and staff who worked with Tosteson praised him as a “visionary”—many of the changes he pushed for remain hallmarks of medical education over 20 years later.Tosteson is credited with modernizing teaching at Harvard and at universities around the world. Through the “New Pathway” program launched in 1985, he advocated for a significant reduction in classroom hours—students once attended lecture until early evening—and a new emphasis on group work and case studies. The former dean realized that scientific knowledge was increasing “exponentially,” and as a result, it would no longer be acceptable for students to devote their time to memorizing facts, said Miriam S. Wetzel, a curriculum coordinator during Tosteson’s tenure.Instead, Tosteson established a program in which students would work in small groups and analyze medical situations to develop problem-solving skills that would remain applicable in the face of accelerating scientific progress. Harvard was the first major medical school in the United States to implement these curricular changes, which set the standard for medical education both at home and abroad.While instituting radical reforms, Tosteson maintained a strong rapport with the Medical School faculty—not all of whom initially embraced his vision for the Medical School’s future.“He was a man of great courage to institute a completely new approach to medical education,” Wetzel said, recalling that some professors were skeptical of students’ ability to acquire all the knowledge they would need in fewer hours of traditional lectures. “There were a lot of jokes about the New Pathway afternoon naps.”Tosteson also recognized the need to embrace cutting-edge and outward-looking research by reconfiguring the Medical School’s academic departments. His tenure saw the creation of the Departments of Cell Biology, Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Health Care Policy, and Social Medicine (renamed the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine). He also made plans to delve into functional genomics, even as some questioned the importance of the field.Though Tosteson implemented sweeping reforms, including interdepartmental initiatives that required a centralization of power, colleagues praised his willingness to support others’ projects without unduly interfering.“He was not a micro-manager,” said S. James Adelstein, executive dean for academic programs under Tosteson. “If [others] did a good job, he let them run with it and supported them as much as possible.”Tosteson was able to realize his expansive vision in part because of his prowess at fundraising. The endowment’s growth from $128 million to $1.1 billion during his 20 year tenure helped to finance a bigger faculty and major construction projects.Though he was consumed by his work, he was “totally present” in the lives of his children, said his son Joshua Tosteson. During family trips to their vacation home in Maine, Tosteson was known to sing sea shanties aboard his boat “Bellina.” Tosteson’s devotion to the Medical School was matched only by his passion for sports. Though a native of Milwaukee, he developed a strong allegiance to the Red Sox and held season tickets behind third base for many years. A football player while an undergraduate at the College, he later golfed religiously, said his son Tor D. Tosteson.In addition to an affinity for jazz music and poetry, the former dean also dabbled in amateur astronomy and his knowledge and interest spanned all the sciences.“He was a huge shadow to walk in and I will gladly walk in it for the rest of my life,” Joshua L. Tosteson ’94 said.Tosteson graduated from the Medical School in 1949 and held administrative posts at Duke and the University of Chicago before returning to Harvard as dean. He received numerous accolades and served as president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1997 to 2000 after stepping down as dean.Tosteson is survived by his wife, a biophysics lecturer at the Medical School, two sons, and four daughters.—Staff writer Athena Y.

As the class of ’09 prepares to say farewell to the Harvard campus, seniors of another sort are greeting it once again. On June 1-4, Harvard and Radcliffe alums return to Harvard for their 50th reunion. 
Members of the class of 1959 are not the only ones returning to campus this week to recollect their undergraduate days. Between May 28 and June 7, Harvard will welcome thousands of alums from classes 1999 through 1939. 
According to Courtney D. Shurtleff, Director of the College Alumni Programs Office, 6,500 alumni and guests are expected on campus this week.
Still, the 50th reunion marks a special place in the minds of many alums. 
“It’s the last chance. If you don’t come to this one, there won’t be another,” said Richard L. Williams ’59, who had previously never attended a college reunion. 
The 50th reunion is among the three largest reunions, along with the 25th and 35th reunions. 
Coordinating among former roommates, teammates and friends, members of the class of ’59 are using the opportunity to re-connect. 
“Our little roommate group got together at Legal Sea Foods last night,” said Martin W. Sachs ’59. “It was nice.” 
But those hoping for happenstance run-ins with old acquaintances may be disappointed. 
“People have changed. The fact that you can’t recognized them makes it really, really difficult,” Williams said.
The campus, too, has morphed. 
“The construction is amazing. At the same time there is a wonderful feeling that it has been here forever,” John F. Dobbyn ’59 said. 
Alums found themselves perplexed at an invitation for lunch at Annenberg Hall. 
“I had no idea what Annenberg Hall was,” said Sachs. 
In 1959, Annenberg Hall was not yet a part of Memorial Hall, and the building was not used for dining. 
The changes did not preclude alums from the opportunity to relive old memories.
“Memorial Hall was where we had the Freshman Smoker [an annual cabaret-style event],” Terence R. Murphy ’59 said. “It was so outrageous that the Freshman Smoker was canceled after that. Somebody poured beer on the heads of one of the deans.”  
“[The reunion] brings back memories of being here as students,” said Radcliffe graduate Mary C. Swope, ’59.
And as they dip into the past, some alums forge connections for the future. 
David Brooks Arnold ’59 remembered his 25th reunion as a “burning experience,” where neither he nor his gay partner were treated well by his former classmates.  
After he wrote about his professional and personal life in the class report this year, classmates Arnold said that he had never met urged him to come to the 50th reunion to connect. 
“When I was here, I felt like an outcast. Now it turns out that there are a lot of people like me. I am delighted,” Arnold said.
—Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwart@fas.harvard.edu.CORRECTION: The June 1 news article "Class of 1959 Remembers Undergraduate Days" incorrectly stated that somebody had poured beer on the heads of "all the deans" at an annual cabaret-style event, based on a statement from Terence R. Murphy '59. In fact, Murphy later clarified that only one of the deans was doused, and the text online has since been updated to reflect the error.

As they prepare to graduate on Thursday, many second-year Harvard Business School students have signed a pledge to act ethically in the business world.
Over 335 Harvard students had signed the pledge, known as the MBA Oath, as of yesterday afternoon, according to organizer Maxwell F. Anderson, a graduating business student. Anderson’s goal is to have 50 percent of the class—or 450 students—sign before graduation on Thursday.
Anderson and a committee of students began organizing a campaign for the oath at a meeting on May 14. Throughout the month, when business students have no class and many are traveling, the committee publicized the oath through email and word-of-mouth.
“What’s blown me away is how many people have signed up,” said Nitin Nohria, a Business School professor who co-authored a 2008 article proposing a business code of ethics. “When [Anderson] first proposed the idea, I said if 100 people sign up before graduation that would be great.”
Several students said they were drawn to taking the pledge due to their personal values and the current economic climate.
“We’re in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis and it’s hard to place blame,” said Brian S. Elliot, a graduating student who helped publicize the oath.  “But, I believe that if business leaders show a stronger commitment to ethical behavior, the avarice that has driven many business decisions in the past might be mitigated in the future.”
Anderson said the push to create an MBA Oath began in earnest after he met with Nohria and his colleague Rakesh Khurana, whose research has focused on reforming management education. 
Both professors say they encouraged Anderson to promote the oath as a grassroots initiative. Nohria said the sense of student ownership has helped make the movement successful on campus.
“As often happens with our students, it took us 10 years to write this article and it took students 10 days to put it in a form where something’s happening,” he said.
However, not all reaction to the oath has been positive. On several online forums, posters have argued that the oath represents empty rhetoric.
Yet Anderson said he believes that the oath has value even without an enforcement mechanism.
“The analogy I think of is a marriage vow,” Anderson said. “You take your vow, it doesn’t mean you won’t cheat on them, but we still as a society believe in the power of those vows.”
A public pledge also allows for accountability and the organizers are considering support methods, such as ongoing education and online discussions to support oath-takers, Anderson said.
Though the organizers’ focus has been on Harvard Business School, they have been contacted by schools across the country and the globe, according to Elliot. On Tuesday afternoon, more than 100 of the 450-plus signers listed on the mbaoath.org Web site were from schools other than Harvard.
Student leaders in the Class of 2010 are currently considering how to follow up on this initiative’s success, said Patrick S. Chun ’04, incoming co-president of the HBS Student Association. From discussions with student government leaders at other elite business schools, it is clear that there is a broad desire to make ethics more visible, Chun said.
Khurana said students’ passionate feelings about ethics should start important discussions within HBS and other business schools.
“This is the students saying they want to see a very different type of ethos in business,” Khurana said. “As business educators, we need to think about what this means in a very deep and profound way.”

The Nieman Conference on Narrative Journalism and the Nieman Seminar for Narrative Editors will be suspended for the 2009-2010 academic year, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard announced last week. The suspension of these programs constitutes a major reduction in spending for the Foundation, which attributed its decision to a university-wide need to make budget cuts in response to the recent economic downturn.“Like most parts of Harvard, we’re facing the necessity of making cuts, and the narrative conference has become a very expensive undertaking,” said Nieman Foundation Curator Robert H. Giles. Giles noted that while many of the extra programs the Foundation administers are funded by special grants or gifts the narrative program is not supported by such funding.The narrative conference, which has convened annually since 2001, is a three day gathering that strives to help journalists to understand the components of effective storytelling and how to apply them to news reporting.Participants have the opportunity to join small break-out groups that focus on specific elements of narrative writing and to network with hundreds of colleagues with similar interests. Past speakers have included prominent journalists like New York Times multimedia specialist Amy O’Leary and Washington Week’s Gwen Ifill, who shared expertise and advice on writing long-form stories. According to Giles, the conferences have always been well-attended, but a recent drop in turnout to the Conference on Narrative Journalism contributed to the Foundation’s decision to suspend the program. Participation dropped from more than 800 people a few years ago to around 500 last year.Despite the financial challenges the Foundation currently faces, Giles voiced optimism about the future of the Nieman Foundation’s narrative program. “We’re suspending it, not eliminating it, so we hope to get the program going again in a couple of years,” he said.In the meantime, the Foundation will maintain its commitment to narrative journalism through the continued operation of the Nieman Narrative Digest, the Foundation’s Web site on narrative journalism. The digest’s online presence includes bimonthly updates featuring examples of outstanding narrative stories and resources on long-form writing.The foundation will also continue to offer the Nieman fellowship program, which is the world’s longest running mid-career training program for journalists.  —Staff writer Monica S.

Robin E. Kelsey, formerly an associate professor specializing in the history of photography, has achieved tenure in the history of art and architecture department. At Harvard since 2001, Kelsey has been recognized by students and faculty for his devotion to teaching and his innovative scholarship. “He is really and truly the complete package—an amazing scholar, beloved teacher, and a really generous and congenial colleague,” said fellow HAA professor Jennifer L. Roberts.  Pedagogically, Kelsey is known for his vibrant lectures and close attention to students. “He’s a fantastic professor,” said Vanessa J. Dube ’10, who has taken multiple classes with Kelsey. “He is able to communicate his expertise into a passion for teaching and he cares a lot about undergraduate life.”  Kelsey’s core class, Literature and Arts B-24: “Constructing Reality: Photography as Fact and Fiction” consistently attracts around 250 students. According to the Q Guide, among Literature and Arts B courses, only “Designing the American City” had a higher enrollment in 2007-2008.  In 2006, Kelsey received the Roslyn Abramson Award, which annually honors two assistant or associate professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for excellence in undergraduate teaching. In addition to the history of photography, Kelsey’s research focuses on landscape and American Art. His first book, “Archive Style: Photographs and Illustrations for U.S. Surveys, 1850-1890,” examined American visual culture through the angle of 19th century geological and geographical surveys. Kelsey is working on a new book about photography and chance, he said.“His work takes the scholarship on photography to a new and different territory,” Roberts said. The combination of both attentive teaching and innovative thought may have prompted his appointment to tenure, Kelsey said. “My understanding is that scholarship is the top priority [in selection] but that teaching receives greater consideration than it did in the past,” he said. Kelsey has also held a number of administrative posts in his time at Harvard. A former attorney, he is currently a member of the Faculty Council, the governing body of FAS. “It is often assumed that people don’t start having departmental responsibility until after they are tenured. He is already on an insane number of University committees,” Roberts said. Kelsey’s administrative role will likely grow as a tenured professor—he was also recently appointed Director of Graduate Studies for HAA. But, Kelsey said, the extra work will not detract from his time in the classroom. “My teaching philosophy and the nature of my courses will remain the same,” he said. —Staff writer Madeleine M.

While fiscal constraints may have forced Harvard to slow construction of its Allston Science Complex, the University has thus far continued delivering the community benefits attached to the project, as outlined in Harvard’s Cooperation Agreement signed with the City of Boston last April. Earlier this spring, the University delivered a $383,865 check to Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, the first of two payments to the City aimed at promoting neighborhood job training. According to University spokeswoman Lauren Marshall, a second funding installment of the same amount is due in January. “We remain firmly committed to supporting job training development in Boston,” said Christopher M. Gordon, chief operating officer for Harvard’s Allston Development Group, in a University press release. “This investment is a continuation of our important partnership with the city of Boston.”The Cooperation Agreement required the University to provide $25 million worth of community benefits to Allston in order to proceed with construction. The Agreement was approved through an expedited process after the University argued that the Science Complex was needed to support groundbreaking research, including stem cell science.According to the University’s statement, Harvard is expected to provide the City with additional payments for housing initiatives as well. In early April, Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority launched the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund, which will provide $500,000 in grants over the next five years to fund community improvement projects that foster neighborhood improvement, cultural enrichment, and educational programs in Allston. The deadline for neighborhood non-profits to submit grant proposals for the upcoming year ended April 30.Harvard’s Allston Education Portal, established last summer as part of the Cooperation Agreement, has been one of the University’s most popular neighborhood initiatives. It currently provides mentoring for local students from undergraduates, a series of lectures from Harvard professors, and summer science clubs and scholarships. Later this month, Harvard will open for the second year its Allston Farmers’ Market, which will be located at the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave. and aims to support local farms and bakers. —Staff writer Peter F.

On January 22, 1984, during the third quarter of Superbowl XVIII, an advertisement aired that would change the world’s perception of computing. As faceless gray drones marched lockstep down a long metallic tunnel, a sledgehammer wielding woman, clad in red and white sportswear raced past them. She approached an enormous screen casting Big Brother’s unhappy gaze upon the crowd and the woman launched the projectile, shattering his visage. The screen froze and words began to scroll: “On January 24th, Apple Computers will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984.’”
“It was a great ad because it didn’t actually tell you anything,” recalls Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis, “it just told you that it was coming.”  Lewis was one of the first people at Harvard to own a Mac.
“I remember standing there on the corner of Oxford Street,” he says, pointing out the window of his office in Maxwell Dworkin, “with this box with the Mac logo on it.”  His outstretched hand passes over bookshelves cluttered with titles such as “A History of Computing in the 20th Century” and “Operating System Principles.” On his walls are computer science charts affixed with masking tape and hangings of Japanese calligraphy.  But the most prominent feature in the space is his pristine, widescreen Mac desktop computer. “It was an exciting moment,” he says, referring to its predecessor.
Until the early 1980s—before the introduction of personal computers—Harvard exclusively provided centralized computing to students and faculty. Richard P. Draves ’85, now a research area manager at Microsoft, remembers, “There were these rooms of terminals in the basement of the Science Center.” The central machine was a VAX 11/780. “It was not a very fast processor,” Draves recalls, “and [at any given time] it was being shared among about 50 students.”
According to Draves, the majority of students who used computers at Harvard relied on this central system for any coursework that required a computer. Computer memory, however, was in short supply: “this machine had about four megabytes of memory,” says Draves. “You know, your phone has more than four megabytes.”
Lewis takes the discrepancy even further: “People do not appreciate what it’s like to live with no memory. Four megabytes is not even a wristwatch.” 
Having to cope with high usage and an agonizingly slow computer response time led Draves to an upsetting conclusion. “I quickly realized that you basically had to pull an all-nighter to get any work done,” he says. “During the day the machine was basically too slow and unusable. You had to be there really late at night when no one was there.”
The difficulties of central computing began to drive students to the convenience of owning their own machines. Eventually, a growing interest in personal computing led to the formation of the Harvard Computer Society. According to current president Josh. A. Kroll ’09, the club was formed in 1983 as a response to student demand. “One of the club’s early duties was as a collective for purchasing computer hardware at a discount,” Kroll wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
In a questionnaire composed by Lewis and dated February 6, 1984, 54 out of 258 respondents had already purchased a computer. They anonymously reported using them for activities ranging from “Expos,” to “studying Latin,” to “various calculations and experiments in math and physics courses, and in German, for learning vocabulary.”  Others who didn’t own a computer seemed ready to make the purchase: one wrote, “Get me a Macintosh!” while another responded, “personal computers are the way to go!”  One student who didn’t own a computer but shared one with a roommate wrote, “I cannot foresee my preparing a paper using anything else.”
Such observations would prove prescient. Lewis calls the exponential growth in computer speed and processing “astonishing.”  Speaking of the trajectory from personal computer squabbles to Internet freedom of information fights, he says, “right now we’re in as much a state of turmoil with that as we were 25 years ago with the question of what to do with these personal devices.”  He adds, however, that, “this will all be settled in 25 years.”
Some Luddites who responded to the 1984 questionnaire, however, refused to acknowledge the march of technology. At the end of the survey, one student proclaimed, “Though I see and understand the advantages of computers and word processors, etc., I DO NOT feel that the technological progress they represent is good. I think it is alienating and it disturbs me greatly. I do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the spring of 1983, Cambridge became the battleground for a showdown between defense contractors and anti-nuclear groups. A grassroots movement spearheaded by voter mobilization group Nuclear Free Cambridge attracted national attention when members began to voice strong opposition to nuclear weapons research and development in the City.
They succeed in putting the issue to a vote in ballot referendum—which voters ultimately rejected in a close vote—that specifically called for the prohibition of various activities related to local production and use
of nuclear weapons and was proposed to take effect on Oct. 1, 1985. Those who rallied behind the referendum claimed that the city would not be completely nuclear-free even if it were to pass, however. Major exemptions to the law would have included nuclear medicinal research and any other nuclear research not intended primarily for the development of weaponry.
LEGAL STRUGGLE
In campaigning for the referendum, advocates encountered a legal barrier: they needed to muster 4,000 signatures to give Cambridge voters an opportunity to vote for or against the measure on the November ballot.
In addition, the Cambridge City Council attempted more than once to keep the question off the ballot due to opposition from special interest groups.
During a series of heated council hearings, opponents of the referendum testified against
its legality and threatened to bring the issue to a higher court if it were to pass.Two major concerns were the possibility
that the measure would violate researchers’ and developers’ First Amendment rights and that it would overrule a preexisting federal measure that approved nuclear weapons research and development.
The referendum was met with criticism from
groups that it would have affected most, including the management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, American Scientific and Engineering, and Cambridge’s largest defense contracting firm, Charles Stark Draper Labs, which was conducting design work on nuclear weapons at the time. The vice president of Draper Labs,
Joseph O’Conner, claimed that its passage could force the company to shut down and prevent new high-tech companies from moving to Cambridge.
“We’re working on programs that have been approved by Congress and the question is whether any local community can take actions that are contrary to what Congress is doing in this area,” O’Conner said in a 1983 interview with The Crimson.
By the time the controversial referendum had
gained momentum, there were already 10 nuclear free zones in the United States.
However, Cambridge had played a leading role in the nuclear freeze movement even before the referendum—it was one of the first cities in the country to support a moratorium on nuclear weapons production through a non-binding referendum in 1981.
NUCLEAR FREE HARVARD
Many Harvard students who opposed nuclear proliferation openly expressed their discontent.
According to then president of the Graduate School of Education’s Student Association Cabinet John B. Chittick, many Harvard students were vocal about their feelings towards nuclear proliferation. “It was a very big item because
[the United States was] still very much involved in the Cold War,” Chittick said.
A large proportion of Harvard students and other Cambridge residents actively supported the referendum due not only to their disapproval of nuclear proliferation, but also to their general tendency to go against the grain.
“My impression was that students at Harvard, speaking generally, that students like the idea of Cambridge being out of step with other cities in the country and Harvard being different from other schools,” Chittick said, adding that “Cambridge was very much against anything that Ronald Reagan stood for.”
Students had advocated against the nuclear
arms race even prior to the referendum. The Harvard Council of Student Leaders, a coalition
of University student government representatives, had launched a campaign to convince graduating Harvard students to wear green armbands at Commencement in protest of nuclear proliferation.
BLITZ CAMPAIGN
“[The nuclear weapons researchers and producers] were scared and brought out the big bucks and guns to fight this; they had really deceptive ads with scientists behind bars,” said Grace C. Ross ’83. Ross, who worked on the Nuclear Free Cambridge campaign, said that they had calculated at the time that the defense industry had spent 27 dollars per vote to rally citizens against the ban.
“It was Cold War language,” Ross said, “They did their best to try to play on people’s fears that if this passed the Soviet Union would take over Cambridge or something.”
However, the proposed measure was ultimately defeated in November of 1983 by an aggressive publicity campaign launched by its opponents, most notably the national organization Citizens Against Research Bans.
Criticism resurfaced once an expenditure report
was discovered. The report showed that approximately 98 percent of campaign donations to CARB came from out-of-state corporate interests that strongly advocated against the referendum.
“What was fascinating is that we were a really grassroots campaign and they had money for advertising, the money they got was from defense industries, and they timed it so that
their contributions did not have to be reported until after they blitzed the city with ads,” said James K. Hammerman ’83—’84, who worked with Boston Mobilization for Survival to pass
the legislation.

Mass. Ave. marks the dividing line between “old Harvard” and “new Harvard”. On one side sits the Yard, the President’s office, the admissions office—all the trappings of a diverse twenty-first century university. On the other side stand the vestiges of “old Harvard”—the Porcellian, A. D., Fly, Owl, Delphic, Fox, Phoenix S. K., and Spee Clubs—the eight remaining all-gentleman’s final clubs of a bygone age.
December 1984 marked year when the presidents of the then-nine final clubs decided to disassociate from the University rather than admit women. But though the official bridge across the Mass. Ave. divide has been burned, relations between the University and the clubs remain complicated.
THE FINAL SPLIT
Before 1984, Harvard officially provided the clubs with access to alumni lists for fundraising, Centrex phone service, and steam heating. But it was Harvard’s policy on discrimination that finally forced them to reevaluate their recognition of the nine exclusively male clubs.
Recognizing clubs that excluded women was not a viable option for a university in the process of fully merging with its neighboring women’s college, Radcliffe. According to former Dean of the College John B. Fox Jr. ’59, severing ties with the clubs was an important part of fully integrating Radcliffe and Harvard, a process that was essentially complete by 1977—though the President of Radcliffe still signed women’s diplomas until 1999.
“The issue of having an antiquated and exclusive club that would not accept women was certainly a controversial issue,” said Victor G. Freeman ’88 a former member of the Undergraduate Council. One that he said “was not going to sit well” in light of the merger.
A catalyzing force in the divorce process was Pi Eta, a now defunct speaking club that Fox said often associated itself with final clubs. This “vestige of an early club system” published a newsletter that referred to women invited to a club party as a “bevy of slobbering bovines fresh for the slaughter.” Though Pi Eta was not itself a final club, the outrage over the publication sparked discussions about whether the final clubs could continue with their ostensibly exclusionary  policies.
Students held a demonstration in response to the incident and a Crimson photographer was arrested for allegedly stepping onto Pi Eta’s property to take a photo of the event. Fox and Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III even asked the club to close, but Pi Eta refused.
Pi Eta’s publication—which then-club President Timothy J. Keating ’85 called a “poor attempt at humor” in a public letter of apology addressed to Fox—though not a product of a final club, was seen as representative of the type of thinking promoted by the final club system in general.
“We received many, many complaints from women about how they were treated when they were invited to go to final clubs and that made it all the more important that we compel the clubs to either get on board [by admitting women members] or get off the ship,” said Fox.
The club presidents chose to jump ship. But the separation did not occur overnight.
SOFT EFFECTS
At first the clubs stalled.But on May 9, 1984 the Committee on College Life set an October 1 deadline for the clubs to decide whether they would admit women or separate. After several extensions of the deadline, on December 8, club presidents met with a subcommittee and indicated they were ready to sever ties, according to a Crimson article from that year.
On December 10, the CCL voted unanimously to affirm the following statement: “The committee notes that the final clubs, after a review of the issues, have decided to revert to their independent status. The committee recommends that the College accept this decision and work to achieve this end as soon as possible.”
The clubs, “content to go their own way” according to Fox, were not necessarily rattled by the split.
“We all expected the severance of ties to have a bigger impact than it did at the PSK,” said Andrew F. Saxe ’84, Phoenix S. K. graduate board member. “We lost our Centrex phone number and had to get a regular number, which, if I recall correctly, actually cost less a year than the University phone system we used.”
Saxe said that at the time the clubs were not as central to social life at the College as the Houses, so their status in regard to the University was not a big issue.
“What truly affected the clubs was the change in the drinking age from 18, then 19, to 21. The campus society craved places where students could socialize and drink and through sheer peer pressure, forced the clubs to open their doors and serve as venues for the broader campus community,” Saxe said.
IT’S COMPLICATED
Yet while formal communication may have been severed in 1984, tenuous links remained. In 1986 The Crimson reported that the A. D. and possibly other clubs had rented the Holyoke Center penthouse through Harvard Real Estate Services.
Individual members are also subject to the College’s policies.
“[Club members] were still subject to the College’s rules on good behavior,” Fox said about his time as dean. “Individual students were still obliged to follow the College’s rules.”
In 1988 one student, Lisa J. Schkolnick ’88, with the help of Law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz, filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination charging the Fly with sexual discrimination.
“I was just personally outraged as a Harvard faculty member that any institution associated with Harvard would have any invidious policies,” said Dershowitz.
But the action was rejected by MCAD, which said that as private entities final clubs were not within their jurisdiction.
For the most part the clubs’ policies have gone unchanged. Today, final clubs remain gender specific, but some female final clubs now exist—though most lack the deep alumni ties and valuable property that male clubs possess. Female clubs are also largely dependent on male clubs for space.
Dershowitz said that he sees the gender discrimination issue as one the University must confront—though with the official lines of communication severed that may be difficult, he admitted.
“As recently as a month ago I was invited to speak at the Fly and I never turn down an invitation to speak, but I turned this one down,” Dershowitz said. “I won’t step foot in a place that discriminates.”
Dershowitz has urged Harvard to adopt a policy to ban any faculty from speaking at places that discriminate while representing the school in any official capacity.
“It’s still a problem,” Dershowitz said. “There is just no room at Harvard for discrimination, we can’t give it any breathing space or wiggle room.”

Philip A. Falcone ’84, founder of Harbinger Capital Partners, was crowned the “Midas of Misery” by BusinessWeek after he made a killing by snapping up failing companies and distressed bonds over the course of his financial career.
Today, Falcone lives in a 27 room penthouse on East 67th St. in Manhattan, bought at the bargain basement price of $49 million.
But to former teammates who knew Falcone when he was an 18 year-old center on Harvard’s Varsity Hockey team, he was a wide-eyed teenager from small-town Minnesota, easily dazzled by Boston’s big city lights.
Money was in his future, not in his blood. Growing up, Falcone shared a three bedroom home with his eight elder siblings. His father was a utility superintendent, and his mother worked for 80 cents an hour at the local shirt factory. 
He ended up as the first person from his high school to attend Harvard. After a plane ride—his first one ever, according to Falcone—to visit the school.
Gregory A. Olson ’83, who was charged with the task of introducing Falcone to city life during his trip to Cambridge as a recruit, remembers him as a teenager who was “very much from Chisholm, Minnesota,” a town of 5,000 people that made up in hockey obsession for what it lacked in population.
“He had his eyes wide open,” Olson recalled. “He said something like, ‘This is unbelievable. This is fantastic,’ and, ‘If they let me in, I’m coming for sure.’”
PLAYING THE GAME
Falcone came to Harvard having secured the distinction of being among one of the best hockey players in Minnesota. As an athlete at Harvard, Falcone was known as a skilled team player and a tireless worker.
“He was a guy that wanted to succeed,” said former teammate Wade C. Lau ’82. “He very much wanted to break away from being a guy from northern Minnesota and was clearly driven to go beyond all of that.”
But Falcone still has doubts about his level of dedication to the game as an undergraduate.
“I always felt preoccupied with something else. I wasn’t 100%,” Falcone said. “I don’t think I had the best career at Harvard.”
After graduation, Falcone left Boston to play center for Malmo, a Swedish hockey team, until a leg injury ended his career in 1985.
His former teammates were hardly surprised when with this first career path prematurely ended and the former economics concentrator delved into the world of finance—a vocation that would eventually catapult him onto Forbes’s list of World Billionaires.
That same year, Falcone joined the securities firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. in the risky business of handling high-interest junk bonds.
It was a smooth transition from skating the hockey rink to trading on Wall Street. 
“I think it was kind of natural for me to move into finance,” Falcone said, citing his decision making skills and competitve nature. 
He did add one caveat: “I wouldn’t have been a good investment banker,” Falcone said. “Patience has never been one of my biggest virtues.”
His career wasn’t without its share of stumbles. He and a college friend purchased a manufacturing company that produced hairbrushes and consumer products, only to see his investment go  under.
Twenty-two years later in 2006, he made another gutsy but deathly accurate bet—that the housing market would tank. It was the kind of boldness and tenacity that characterized his personality as an athlete as well, friends say. 
“I would describe Phil as a guy that was determined and not afraid to take chances, on or off the ice,” former teammate Shayne R. Kukulowicz ’84 said.
Today, Falcone still prefers hiring former athletes. According to Falcone, Harbinger Capital Partners now employs four Harvard grads, three of them former hockey players. 
“One of the things that [Coach Bill Cleary] always said to us was, ‘I can always tell how someone’s going to do in business by how they play hockey,” Anthony Visone ’84 recalled.
IT’S JUST MONEY
Over the last 25 years Falcone has ascended as a self-made financial entrepreneur—founding his own hedge-fund, Harbinger Capital Partners, in 2001.
Visone says that when the two last met five or six years ago, with a group of friends at a Boston restaurant, Falcone secretly picked up the check.
“You could tell everything was kicked up a notch,” Visone recalled. “He had on $800 shoes instead of $300 shoes...You could tell that he knew he was going to make a lot of money. He had a confidence to him.”
But Visone was quick to add that Falcone has remained humble despite acquiring an enormous amount of wealth.
Kukulowicz has a similar assessment of Falcone 25 years and many more dollars later.
Has the boy from Chisholm changed?
“You know, other than making a shitload of money, I’m not sure a whole lot,” Kukulowicz said.
In college, Falcone’s teammates recalled teasing the appearance conscious jock with locker room nicknames like “Phyllis” or “Fashion Phil”.
“I can imagine he’s a still a clothes horse. We always though it was ironic he ended up running a hairbrush company at one point,” Kukulowicz said.
Olson and Falcone would exchange tapes—a favorite was ’80s pop music duo Hall & Oates—and play them on long bus rides to games.
“He came from a poor family, and to come from a poor family, you can’t go back,” said Olson, who identified with Falcone because of their common blue collar, Minnesota roots. “Because of that, he had the drive to succeed...He said something like, ‘I can always pump gas back in Chisholm.’”
Though he has made it as a financial hard-hitter today, he emphasizes his small-town roots. He calls upon his family and twin daughters to help him keep perspective in the ultra-competitive world of Manhattan. 
At the end of the day, it’s just a job. As for the risks of trading, he says, “This is not life or death.”
“I try to always never forget where I came from,” Falcone said. “I’ve never let money intimidate me, and even today, I never intimidate with money. Because it’s just money.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the morning of Saturday June 6, 2009,
while other reunion classes sleep in, the class
of 1984 will already be awake and on banks
of the Charles River. But alumni in town for
their classes’ 25th reunion will not be there
picnic or to laze on the river. Instead, they will be cleaning it.
In the Green-Up Volunteer Project, the class of 1984 will display its commitment to
the green movement and to public service in
what the 1984 reunion Web site calls a “reunion
tradition.” Twenty years ago, in 1989,
the class of 1984 was the first class to integrate pubic service into fifth class reunions, said Anne S. Holtzworth ’89, one of the five co-chairs of the Reunion Committee. Alumni went throughout Boston and Cambridge doing various volunteer activities with City Year.
With the Green-Up Volunteer Project, the
class of 1984 will be the first class to integrate public service into the twenty-fifth reunion, said Hortzworth. The Reunion Committee
has teamed up with the Philips Brooks House
Association and the Charles River Conservancy
Project to encourage class members and
their children (ages 10 and up) to help clean
the banks of the Charles. They will also offer
tours of the Blackstone Complex, Harvard’s
first Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) Platinum building.
The Project also reflects the class’ latest
goal: making this the first Green 25th reunion.
Embracing the slogan “Green is the New Crimson,” the Reunion Committee is prioritizing environmental awareness in planning the reunion. Alumni are all encouraged to take Harvard’s Sustainability Pledge, use
biodiesel fuel buses, eat local foods, and limit their usage of paper and plastic, among many other initiatives. In the planning process, the Committee has limited its usage of paper, mobilizing e-mail and Facebook. The Committee even plans to follow up with their classmates
in the hopes that they will change their habits
based on what they learned at the reunion to
offset the reunion’s usage of carbon dioxide
by next year.
The green initiative is just one of the many
“class firsts” that the Class of 1984 have initiated
in their reunions. The Class was the first
to have a memorial service, typically not held
until the twenty-fifth, as early as the fifth reunion
and in subsequent reunions. The Reunion
Committee for 1984’s fifth reunion felt
that there was enough of a need and desire
for such a service and that the deceased class
members should not have to wait until the
twenty-fifth reunion to be honored. The class
was also the first to extend its reunion to Sunday
brunch, instead of having the last reunion
activity on Saturday night.
Many of these have subsequently become
traditions, and other classes have since followed
suit, making the Class of 1984 trendsetters
in the reunion-planning arena. “We’re
quirky and socially conscious and innovators.
We tend to add our own flavors to things,”
said Hortzworth.
The drive to plan good reunions, even if it
means deviating from the standard Harvard
reunion program, stems from the desire to include
as many alumni as possible and to cater
to their needs.
“We have always tried to improvise and
make it a better program that reflects the time
we were in and what our class likes,” said Jay
G. Hooper ’84. “I think in essence it shows
that we have a class that cares about Harvard
and the world in which we live.”
If response rates offer some indication of
the planners’ success, then the class of 1984
has won, breaking a record for having the largest
class report with the highest participation
rate of about two-thirds. For this reunion, the
Reunion Committee is offering price packaging
plan different from others at the University,
including a weekend only package, in
order to make the reunion more affordable.
“The overarching goal is to create a reunion
that would attract as many of our classmates
as possible...we wanted to make it an as inviting
and accepting reunion as possible,”
said Reunion Committee Co-Chair Raine
M. Figueroa ’84. “I hope they will reconnect
with as many classmates as possible,
meet new friends, and have a good time. I
really hope they have fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a college freshman, Lisa J. Randall '84 stood out for many reasons.
In her first semester, she enrolled in Math 55 and Physics 55, the most
difficult freshman math and physics classes offered.But Randall also stood out for another reason—she enjoyed one of Harvard’s most reviled classes, Expository Writing 20.
“It taught me to think about what people were saying in a really different way,” Randall said. 
This ability to thrive in any academic environment reflects the curiosity that characterizes Randall’s intellect. This trait, along with a penchant for original thought, have defined Randall’s celebrated career as a theoretical physicist.
Over the past two decades, Randall has made significant contributions to the study of particle physics, supersymmetry, and cosmology. Her theories on the existence of extra dimensions have made her one of the most famous scientists in the world.
Randall has also changed the popular conception of a physicist. Before coming to Harvard in 2001, Randall had already become the first tenured woman in the Princeton physics department and the first tenured female physics theorist at MIT.
BEGINNINGS
Randall grew up in New York City in the 1970s and attended Stuyvesant High School, a magnet school that focuses on math and science. In her early years, she was interested in a wide array of subjects. Though she described herself as a voracious reader,  she was particularly drawn to math.
“I liked it because it had definite answers,” Randall said. “It might have been the fact that I grew up in volatile times in New York City, so I liked the certainty of knowing which answers were right.”
When it came time to choose a college, Randall said she wanted a liberal arts education because of the breadth of her interests and her desire to meet different types of people.
After arriving at Harvard, she threw herself into her studies and finished her undergraduate career in three years, graduating Phi Beta Kappa. From there, she began working on her physics Ph.D., under the guidance of Harvard physics professor Howard M. Georgi ’68, who had previously instructed Randall in Physics 55.
“Some theoretical physicists are terrific at mathematical or geometrical imagination. Some are better at imaginative thinking about the actual phenomena,” Georgi wrote in an e-mail. “Lisa is great at both.”
During this time, Randall began to learn about building models of the physical universe, and she participated in research on why our universe is formed out of matter, rather than antimatter.
Her talent for understanding physical models would be a strength in much of her subsequent work.
HER STAR RISES
Randall first became interested in the study of extra dimensions about 10 years ago. Collaborating with Johns Hopkins University professor Raman Sundrum, Randall began exploring the geometry of space and time. The pair quickly came to some startling results.
“They were so radical, we wanted to make sure we were right,” Randall said. 
Using complicated math, Randall then showed that space and time could be warped. She argued that our universe exists in a three-dimensional “brane” within a higher-dimensional universe.
The theory, first published in 1999, jolted the physics world. Among the many intriguing implications of this model is an explanation for why gravity is so weak compared to the other fundamental forces. According to Randall, the strange geometry of these higher dimensions could mean that gravity varies between the dimensions, and happens to be weak in our three dimensional brane. 
Since rising to prominence with this theory, Randall has been listed as one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2007, and has been featured in publications as diverse as “Scientific American,” “Newsweek,” and “Vogue.”
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE PHYSICS
Speaking to Randall’s many colleagues and friends, it is startling just how many talents and interests they ascribe to her.
Northeastern physics professor Darien Wood fondly discusses their rock-climbing outings together, while writer Anna Christina Buchmann describes their trips to the ballet, and Harvard economics professor Kenneth S. Rogoff says he is wowed by her understanding of the financial crisis.
Lisa’s younger sister Dana J. Randall ’88, a computer science professor at Georgia Tech, said Lisa has “always been fascinated by people who can multitask and do many things,” perhaps because she is one, herself.
In fact, friends consistently describe Randall as inquisitive, broad-minded, and constantly thirsting for knowledge.
“She is extremely interested in new things, and she’s so quick and she’s so curious but she doesn’t have that stage of intimidation that most people have,” Buchmann said. “There is no pause, she just plunges.”
Randall said it was due to this breadth of interest that she opted to write a book and the lyrics to an opera in recent years.
The process of writing “Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mystery of the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions” presented her with “the challenge of trying to use references people would recognize and appreciate,” Randall wrote in an e-mail,. “I certainly had a lot to learn about writing.”
After the book’s publication, Randall was contacted by a composer who wanted to collaborate on an opera. The project would require Randall to write all the lyrics for the show. Randall decided to approach the challenge the same way she approaches physics.
“I like these types of problems where you’re trying to be creative, but you have to conform to certain constraints,” she said.
The show, an hour-long opera for two performers, will premiere in Paris this summer.
MOVING FORWARD
Randall said she plans to continue teaching both a freshman seminar and graduate student courses, as each is rewarding in its own way.
Randall will also continue to do research in a wide variety of fields, and she said she plans to explore her theory of extra dimensions “as long as there is new material to be covered.”
As to side projects, Randall said she spent much of her career focusing almost exclusively on physics—and she is enjoying trying her hand at new things. Those around her seem certain that she will choose her activities very carefully, as only the most enticing projects can draw her away from her research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a Boston Celtics home game against the New York Knicks in the early ’80s, the crowd of raucous Boston fans had no qualms flaunting their hometown pride. But neither did a young Eliot Spitzer, a native New Yorker and student at Harvard Law School who sat among the season ticket holders shamelessly cheering the Knicks and brazenly booing the crowd’s clear favorite.
“All of a sudden, this one woman turns around, points to Eliot, and says, ‘I’m going to tell [Law Professor] Alan Dershowtiz that you were cheering for the Knicks,’” said Cliff Sloan ’79, a close friend and classmate of Spitzer who attended the game with him. Dershowitz had given Spitzer and Sloan, his research assistants, the tickets.
“For Eliot, it was a true act of principle—or maybe insanity. He just laughed it off,” added Sloan, who is also a former Crimson editorial editor.
Before his rapid ascension to the helm of the New York Governor’s office, before the headlines that dubbed him “The Most Powerful Man on Wall Street,” and before the news pieces that caricatured him as a crusading lawyer with a hidden agenda against influential moneymen, Spitzer was known for his quick wit, confidence, and intellect, say his friends and classmates.
“Eliot is somebody who always gets a kick out of things. He loves to laugh and often gets convulsed with laughter,” Sloan said. “There is this famous series The New York Times ran, and it printed pictures of Eliot, Jim [Cramer], and I clowning around in a photo booth—Eliot actually gave it to them willingly. And that is something very consistent with what I remember from law school: a lot of joking around.”
Largely regarded as an effective, albeit abrasive, executive, Spitzer catapulted to the governorship in 2007 after having served as Attorney General from 1999 to 2006. On March 17, 2007, he resigned in disgrace on account of his connections to an elite prostitution ring.
A COMEDIC INTELLECTUAL
The former governor’s penchant for jokes may have been his method of choice for coping with the high-stress environment of law school.
“Law school is just a tense situation,” said Florrie Darwin, a former classmate and current lecturer at the Law School. “Instead of being unhappy as many people were, Eliot’s mode was just to do what he had to do and deal with the tension by making light of things, using humor as a way of helping everybody around him during the day.”
A quarter-century after he graduated from the Law School, others who know Spitzer more vividly remembered his superhuman work ethic.
As a second-year law student, he rarely produced anything that wasn’t meticulous or submitted on time, said Dershowitz, for whom Spitzer worked on the high-profile Claus von Bülow  case.
“I’d give him an assignment at seven at night, and he would have it in at nine in the morning, there in completed form, waiting for me on my desk,” Dershowitz said.
“I remember telling him, ‘Eliot, have some fun. All work and no play makes Eliot a dull boy.’ But I wish he hadn’t listened to me,” he recalled with a laugh.
A HARDENED POLITICIAN’S SOFTER SIDE
Spitzer’s diligence eventually led to a political career centered on aggressively combating organized crime and corruption, first in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office and later as the State’s chief lawyer.
Media coverage of Spitzer had oftentimes been critical, Spitzer’s friends allege.
A Wall Street Journal editorial leading up the 2006 gubernatorial election accused him of “denying, dissembling and developing convenient cases of amnesia,” in the face of accusations of abuse in office as attorney general. A 2007 New Yorker feature labeled the then-newly elected Governor Spitzer as an “aggressive personality with an ambitious agenda.”
“During the time that he was [attorney general] he ruffled a lot of feathers, and there were certain groups that felt he was overzealous in his prosecutions, and overaggressive as governor [when] he dealt with Republicans,” Darwin said. “But in all the settings I’ve seen him, I wouldn’t say he has only been ambitious, but rather an empathic and generous guy.”
Both Darwin and Sloan recalled incidents of Spitzer’s “generosity and intense loyalty as a friend.”
When Sloan suffered a heart attack in early 2000, he said that Spitzer left New York the next day during a busy time as attorney general to be at his bedside in a Washington, D.C. hospital.
“It meant a tremendous amount to me and my wife,” Sloan said. “It was reassuring to see him, when all of sudden, I’m in the hospital, an alien in a strange land. That’s the kind of thing he does all the time—that’s the kind of person he is.”
Over the last year, the Spitzer family has endured intense public scrutiny after it was disclosed that the former governor spent as much as $80,000 on prostitutes over a period of several years.
“One of the things that got overlooked in coverage of his family was how close they all are and continue to be,” Sloan said, adding that Spitzer “has had and continues to have a close relationship” with his wife, Silda Wall, whom he met and dated while at the Law School. Spitzer’s daughter, Elyssa A.L. Spitzer ’12, is a Crimson news editor.
REBUILDING AN IMAGE
Initially, the fallout over Spitzer’s personal misconduct seemed to have irrevocably tarnished a political career that many thought would peak at the presidency. But in recent months, the former governor has made forays into the public arena—authoring several columns for Slate Magazine in which he offers insight into the economic crisis, appearing on the cover of Newsweek Magazine in April 2009, and simultaneously fueling speculation that he will attempt a political comeback.
But Dershowitz, Darwin, and Sloan all emphasized that Spitzer—who has been interested in various policy issues since his time at the Law School—should continue to engage in those debates.
“It would be a tremendous loss if he didn’t play an important role in the economic and political future of this country,” Dershowitz said. “And I hope we don’t reject it because of moralistic hypocrisies.”
According to his friends, it’s not just Spitzer’s intellect but his “character” that makes him apt to play an enduring role in public service.
“He is very open, loves to mix it up in terms of thoughts and ideas, and I think one thing that people have sometimes misunderstood is the true secret of his success,” Sloan said. “It’s comical to him when people discuss some elaborate calculus behind his actions because that’s just not who he is. The irony of it all is that he’s been very successful because he genuinely cares about the public.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“On campus and among the freshman class, she was known as the banjo woman,” Virginia “Ginger” M. Young ’84 said of her first-year roommate Alison H. Brown ’84. Unlike many prospective students who scour the academic and social offerings of potential colleges, Brown flipped through club listings in the magazine “Bluegrass Unlimited” as a guide for deciding between Harvard or Yale. She eventually opted for Boston and Cambridge’s legendary bluegrass scene.By the time Brown enrolled at Harvard as a freshman, she had already recorded an album, toured the nation with fiddler Stuart Duncan, and won the Canadian National Banjo Championship.Brown has traveled a unique path to become a Grammy Award-winning artist and co-founder of a record label, Compass Records.But though she first picked up the instrument when she was ten, it was not until 1987 that she was able to make it her profession.PRODIGAL ROOTSBrown’s first year roommates found the combination of her California background and musical interest both delightful and bizarre. “If you are a bluegrass fiddle player, why are you from San Diego?” Monica A. Angle ’84 recalls thinking. Yet when Brown moved from her self-described “surfer chick” culture to Harvard, she said that she found her niche.“Alison was a convener among conveners—people would bring over their instruments for jam sessions,” Angle said. And despite Brown’s soft-spoken personality Angle said that Brown still managed to be “a center point with the ability to draw people together.”William W. Carter ’84, a fellow banjo player who lived down the hall from Brown in Hurlbut, said that he had heard of Alison’s talent just days into freshmen week, and when they finally met, the two immediately took advantage of each other’s musical prowess.Young recalls their jam sessions reverberating through the dorm stairwell until three or four in the morning. Carter and Brown eventually started a band of their own that they called “Crimson Bluegrass,” and the two spent many of their Saturday mornings playing on their WHRB show, “Living Traditions in Bluegrass.”After she and Carter went to audition at Harvard Square’s Nameless Coffeehouse, their audition sheet was returned  with a note: “No way could these people be Harvard freshmen”.But despite Brown’s obvious talent, her academic workload belied the possibility of a future in music. Brown said that her parents hoped she would become a doctor, and she stuck to her pre-med requirements for two years. Brown took only one introductory music course but never learned to read standard notation music, and eventually concentrated in History and Literature.Brown eventually wrote her senior thesis on the history of American bluegrass. Robert W. Jones ’84, who knew her as an undergraduate, said as part of her senior thesis research, Brown traveled to Washington D.C. to interview one of the founding fathers of bluegrass, Bill Monroe.“She discovered the historical context for her own work,” Jones said. “She stood in the community of whose history she was documenting.”THE PATH HOMEAfter college, Brown made what seemed to be a peculiar move—she enrolled in the University of California Los Angeles Business School.When asked about her decision, Brown said, “My parents, who were both lawyers, always encouraged me to think of banjo as an avocation rather than a vocation.” After earning her MBA, Brown embarked on a two-year stint with the investment bank Smith Barney in the public finance division of their San Francisco office. But she could not keep her mind away from music and the banjo. Eventually, Brown said, she gathered up the nerve to ask for six months of leave.“When I [told my parents] I was quitting my I-banking job, there was a pregnant pause at the other end of the line,” Brown said. Her parents were initially skeptical about her decision to enter the uncertain world of the music industry, but in 1987, Brown received an offer she could not refuse. Alison Krauss, who had just released her first solo album as a bluegrass singer and fiddler, invited Brown to join her on a tour with the Union Station band as their banjo player. Brown toured with the ensemble for the next three years and their first gig brought back to the gates of Harvard in Sanders Theatre.SERENDIPITYIn short order, Brown began receiving accolades from the professional music industry for her playing. In 1991, she collected the most prestigious of awards for a bluegrass instrumentalist—the International Bluegrass Music Association Banjo Player of the Year.In 1992 she began touring as band leader with pop-folk artist Michelle Shocked, and in 1995 she launched her own record label, Compass Records, with her husband bassist Gary West.Brown recalls that the process of starting her own label brought her back to the gates of her alma mater. She remembers picking up Harvard Magazine in the Charles Hotel and learning that Melissa J. Block ’83 was working at National Public Radio. Block set up an interview with Brown on her radio show “All Things Considered.”Later, Brown met her future Compass Records partner at a Harvard Club luncheon in Nashville. When she went to Australia to start her own record label, Brown said that she received a letter from him that read “Dear Allison, I’ve just left my job and if you’re ever looking for investment money, please keep me in mind.” The label now represents an eclectic group of almost 100 musical artists, ranging from Celtic to folk to jazz.Brown said that she marvels at the “Harvard serendipity” that made the record launch possible.In 2007, University President Drew G. Faust asked Brown to play at her inauguration. She described the feeling of playing in Sanders Theatre as “an incredible thrill.” But Brown insisted that the path that led her to her current life was a winding journey that required a “big decision made in small steps...at every fork in the road.” Still, making music her life’s work, she said, can be described as simply “magical.”—Staff writer Victor W.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 1984 Harvard Rugby Football Club was so busy raising the money to compete that its players did not see their own victory coming.They scrambled, they begged, and they even called on rugby alumnus Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 to raise the $10,000 for plane ticket to California. They pleaded with the Undergraduate Council for additional funds, but to no avail. The Harvard Athletic Department even refused to subsidize the ruggers—after all, they played a mere club sport.But under the tutelage of graduate student Martyn E. Kingston, the “fun-loving” bunch of ex-varsity athletes, many hailing from high school football and soccer careers, not only dominated their Northeastern, Eastern, and Ivy competition, but also clobbered their national competition in the National Rugby Championship game against the University of Colorado in the spring of 1984—an accomplishment that has never been repeated.“The whole run to the national championships not only caught the university by surprise, it caught us by surprise...All of a sudden, we didn’t have a budget,” said George L. Askew ’85, who was a junior on the winning team. “We weren’t the most popular—that’s an understatement.”Having never won more than a Northeastern Championship title, Harvard Rugby Football Club members never dreamed that they would have such good luck during that historic spring season.Looking back, the victory makes more sense. They had Coach Kingston, a man “who appeared to have started to play in rugby when he was in the womb,” according to rugger Giles A. Birch ’85.According to Kingston, coaching a rugby team was a natural extension of his love for the game.“In summer of 1981, I was wandering down their athletic facility and bumped into a group of guys who were rugby players,” Kingston recalls. “That was the beginning of it.”Under Kingston’s leadership, their technical skill level peaked, according to Birch. In his decade of coaching at Harvard, Kingston said that this team was composed of the fittest set of athletes he had ever seen.During virtually every season between 1982 and 1984, the team welcomed two or three “very good” athletes from other sports, which according to Kingston allowed the team to build momentum. Being a club sport worked in the team’s favor in other ways. They subscribed to a “work hard, play hard” philosophy, and were known for having a keg on the sidelines during games, which would not have been allowed under varsity regulations.Because they lacked the administrative funds that only varsity sports teams enjoyed, the HRFC depended on creative housing solutions for away games.“We couldn’t afford hotels,” said Keith W. Cooper ’83, president of the team in 1983 and the current president of the Harvard rugby alumni association. “We’d generally try to find a girl sorority and try to make friends.”When asked to recount tales from their college years, alumni were close-mouthed about their youthful antics, replying their stories were too boozy for publication.“Most of our stories aren’t fit for print,” Askew said.But they knew when to give up sorority sisters for the practice field.“We trained hard,” Birch said. “We may not have been the fastest team or the strongest team, but we were smart. And we knew how to play and put the ball where we wanted it to go.”But they did have a few technical hurdles to overcome. “I didn’t even know the rules for the first year that I played,” Cooper admitted.Out of all the players on the winning team, Kingston estimates that two or three had played the game before arriving at Harvard. He contrasts this with the current powerhouse rugby teams, who field teams comprised mainly seasoned rugby champs that practiced in multimillion-dollar facilities.The game itself has also evolved since 1984.“It was more of a gutsy and a hard hitting game versus the flowing and more technical game today,” Cooper said. “The bigger, tougher teams tended to win back then. That’s the type of team that Harvard had in ’83 and ’84.”The team has come a long way since their championship scramble for travel funds, which was eventually pieced together by loans from unnamed Harvard officials, according to a 1984 Crimson article. Now, alumni have raised “hundreds of thousands,” according to Cooper, which means that the ruggers no longer have to depend on wooing sorority girls for housing.They also came close to replicating their 1984 win in 2007, when the team made it as far as the National Championships. Twenty-five years later, Askew still marvels at what unlikely champions they were. “We were the upstarts from Harvard who really didn’t belong there,” Askew said. “It’s almost as if we stumbled into this thing. We didn’t quite realize how good we were until the final whistle blew and we were national champions.” —Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu—Staff writer Marianna N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He has been called the modern Darwin. He often spends months in the jungle collecting lizard specimens with nooses made of floss. He has been challenged by The National Enquirer.He is Harvard Herpetologist Jonathan B. Losos ’84.Through decades of fieldwork in remote Caribbean islands, the St. Louis native has successfully charted the evolution of multiple species of lizards in real time. By conducting rigorous biological and behavioral analyses of animals on tiny islands that are repeatedly devastated by hurricanes, Losos has produced some of the only empirical scientific evidence documenting evolution.“Darwin got one thing particularly wrong,” Losos said. “He said that evolution had to occur very slowly.”In fact, Losos has proven that evolution can occur very rapidly and that lizards will adapt to different environments at observable speeds. Thus, according to his research, evolutionary biology can be an experimental science.Losos has published about 125 scientific articles—over a dozen in just the journals Nature and Science—and his first book “Lizards and an Evolutionary Tree,” comes out next month, according to his father Joseph O. Losos ’52. Though to the public Jonathan Losos may be known only as an evolutionary biology rock star, students applaud his calm temperament and commitment: four years ago, he took his freshmen seminar students on an all-expense-paid field study to Puerto Rico, where he was dubbed “Indiana Jones” after sporting a wide brimmed hat and rolling under beds to catch loose specimens.And though he has not taken a traditional career path—he once considered applying to law school—family members say they could scarcely imagine him doing anything else.Losos harbored an obsession with dinosaurs as a toddler, and he soon became obsessed with modern reptiles and “all sorts of scaly things,” said his sister Louise W. Losos ’90.According to family lore, Jonathan Losos begged his parents for a pet reptile after watching a classic “Leave it to Beaver” episode at age 11 or 12—in which the title character obtains an alligator—and would not relent until his parents agreed to meet their family friend, the director of the St. Louis Zoo, to discuss the prospect of housing two caimans in the family basement.  Much to his parents’ chagrin, the zoo director thought housing the small crocodiles was a wonderful idea: the director’s reptilian childhood pets had piqued his own interest in zoology.Losos’ adored his caimans, according to his father, and joined the St. Louis Herpetology society at age 12.“He was probably their youngest member,” said his father. When it was time for Jonathan to leave for college, the caimans had swelled to a full two and a half feet. Losos decided to donate his prized pets to the St. Louis Zoo, where he had volunteered every summer.Even outside of St. Louis, Losos insisted that reptiles play an integral role on every family vacation—or he would refuse to attend.During a trip to Arizona in his early teens, Losos created a device that he continued to use until very recently: a fishing pole wound with dental floss could be used to catch lizards. He would spend hours hunting down the creatures, and, according to his sister, he was “very successful at it.”On a trip to Sri Lanka, when Losos was a senior in high school, the family had a layover in Paris. While the rest of the family went to historical sites in the city, Losos went to the zoo.Though he frequents the Bahamas for his field research, his sister said that he spends no time sunning himself on the beach. Thus, it is a family joke that Lasos was the subject of a National Enquirer inquiry into government-sponsored luxury vacations parading as cushy research grants.“He had the article up on his refrigerator for a long time,” said his eldest sister, Elizabeth Losos ’85. Harboring a lifelong penchant for rugged terrain, Losos first discovered field work in Jamaica while working on-site collecting lizard specimens for a Harvard graduate student after his sophomore year in college. And conducting field work in the Caribbean would be one of many college forays that would be repeated once he returned to Harvard over twenty years later as an esteemed professor.Freshman year, Losos took an evolutionary biology course taught by celebrated biologist Edward O. Wilson that would convince him to pursue his passion in organismic biology. Losos now teaches that same course, with an updated syllabus.—Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps drawing inspiration from Isaac Newton, when physicist Brian R. Greene ’84 worked deep into the night on classical mechanics homework as an undergraduate, he routinely consumed upwards of 15 apples in a single sitting, courtesy of the dining hall.Greene’s unusual eating habits were legendary among his Winthrop housemates. They also belied a compulsive nature, one that propelled Greene to the forefront of theoretical physics. He is also lauded outside the academic realm for his two bestsellers, “The Elegant Universe” and “Fabric of the Cosmos,” which brought esoteric concepts of string theory to the masses.Theoretical physicists are rarely household names, yet “The Elegant Universe” worked its way to number four on the New York Times Best-Seller List. The book was eventually made into a PBS miniseries, narrated by Greene. Now a tenured professor at Columbia University, Greene has taught applications of quantum mechanics to a spectrum of students ranging from budding Harvard physicists to comedian Stephen Colbert.CHILD’S PLAYGreene’s enthusiasm for mathematics began early. The physicist said that by the seventh grade, he had “maxed out” on the coursework his school had to offer. Greene’s teacher sent him knocking on doors at Columbia in search of a professor willing to teach him.“[The note] basically said, ‘Help this kid learn some stuff, he’s beyond what we can do,’” Greene recalled. He found a teacher in the math department who agreed to take him on, and the two met three times a week until his high school graduation.“That’s where the interest really flourished,” Greene said. “I was able to keep going on at a pace that felt right, rather than a pace that the school was offering.”Greene was treading uncharted academic territory in his family. His father dropped out of high school and his mother did not finish college. Though his father lacked formal education, Greene said, he was very intellectual and was “captivated by ideas.” Greene’s older brother left the University of Wisconsin to follow the Hare Krishna movement. Despite their different paths, Greene said his brother’s interests are very similar to his own.“We both ask the big questions, but he looks at it from a very different point of view.”HOME AT HARVARDThough Greene originally chose Princeton over Harvard, in the summer before his freshman year he started to doubt that Princeton’s pastoral setting was ideal for a teenager used to the bustle of New York City. Weeks before school began, Greene called a Harvard dean and asked for his spot back.Harvard gave him just one week to accept, and this time, Greene was certain he made the right choice.Eero P. Simoncelli ’84, Greene’s roommate of three years, insisted that in college he and Greene were not stereotypical physics nerds—they showered regularly—and though they were not “party animals,” they were pretty social in college.“We both worked pretty hard but we both played pretty hard too,” Simoncelli said.Simoncelli also recalled devoting entire weekends—Friday after dinner until early Monday morning—to problem sets for a particularly difficult course in their junior year. He adds that though the two were very studious, they had interests outside of physics.Greene was active in the Harvard theater scene as an actor. According to Simoncelli, Greene’s interest in the arts may have been inspired by his father—a bass player and vocal coach who had taught Harry Belafonte.Though it always was clear that Greene would be an important physicist, it was this interest in theater, Simoncelli suggested, that may have foreshadowed his later entree in the popular science arena.“He loved being on stage when he did those shows,” he said. “I think when he became a scientist, he started giving talks and realized how much he enjoyed it.”DOWN TO A SCIENCEJust as he roamed the halls in search of a willing mentor in the seventh grade, Greene said he would “unabashedly knock on professors’ doors” at Harvard. He asked astrophysics professor James M. Moran if he could conduct research in his lab. Moran was surprised at the time that a physics student would seek out research in astronomy. “We are up here in the observatory—it’s rare to have a physics kid tramping through looking for projects, at least back then,” he said.Though Moran said it was a bit unusual to give a project to an undergraduate, he was willing to take Greene on.Twenty-five years later, Moran still recalls Greene’s extraordinary proficiency in computer programming.“Nowadays people can use established programs,” Moran said. “He did everything from scratch and did the programming to make it work.”Even though Greene’s talents were notable, Moran had no idea that his student would garner such acclaim. “He was just a very smart Harvard undergraduate,” Moran said. “I was doing lots of stuff back then, I didn’t really recognize the gem he was.”—Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By their graduation, the class of 1984 left Harvard struggling with what seemed to be a growing problem: year after year, more women at the University were reporting incidents of sexual harassment.Just months after the administration drafted a new policy that outlined procedures for reporting incidents of sexual misconduct, the University publicized for the first time that it would “reprimand” Government Professor Martin L. Kilson for allegedly attempting to kiss a freshman woman during his office hours.Over the next four years, the Kilson case would open a pandora’s box. Two other incidents involving faculty members and students made headlines on a campus that had, up until that point, been largely silent on the issue.“I know that the University’s policy in a way hadn’t really paid attention to that issue,” said University Professor Sidney Verba ’53, who was the associate dean for Undergraduate Education at the time. “There was a time when that whole notion didn’t even exist.”But in 1984, the University could no longer afford to ignore what seemed to be a growing problem. Students and staff began raising concerns that the Harvard’s sexual harassment procedures were inadequate, leaving female students, staff members and junior faculty vulnerable on a campus disproportionately male in both senior faculty and high-level administrators.During the 1983-1984 academic year, the government department established a committee to investigate incidents within the department, administrators facilitated informal meetings with student group leaders on the cases, faculty members, including Verba, presented a policy statement on the issue to the Faculty, and over a thousand students signed a petition lobbying for the creation of a University-wide office that would supervise the grievance process.Meanwhile, a growing list of women began to come forward, with complaints ranged from inappropriate comments to what constituted, according to Government Professor Robert D. Putnam, “a crime.”A DEMAND FOR DISSOCIATIONSeniors in the class of 1984 returned to Harvard in the fall to another shock. Popular Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez had been implicated in the second sexual harassment scandal in two years—this time, the case involved a junior faculty member and a female graduate student.Unlike the two incidents that came before it, students and Dominguez’ colleagues remember this case presenting a unique challenge to University officials desperately trying to assuage a hemorrhaging wound that the harassment cases had opened. Dominguez, widely considered the department’s foremost expert on Latin American politics, taught Government 2105: “Field Seminar in Comparative Politics,” a class that would be necessary for almost any government student preparing for general exams in that field.Putnam said that the Department assigned him to co-teach the course with Dominguez to minimize the controversy surrounding his continued teaching presence, even as they were unwilling to take disciplinary action against the University’s sole expert in Latin American politics at the time.In the months after the Dominguez incident went public, female graduate students began demanding that the University allow them to “dissociate” from individuals implicated in sexual misconduct. Students could then be exempt both from required enrollment in that instructor’s class and from facing that professor on an exam board. The policy was endorsed by the recently formed eight-student Government Department Sexual Harassment Committee, the Graduate Student Council, Women in Science, and the Radcliffe Union of Students.OPENING UP A PAINFUL DIALOGUEThe administration had consistently stopped short of revoking a faculty member’s coveted tenure appointment on account of sexual harassment accusations, however. It would not make that move until early 1985, when Government Professor Douglas A. Hibbs Jr. was forced to resign, making him the third faculty member in the government department to be publicly accused of sexual misconduct in a six year period.“They were a huge deal,” Ann Pellegrini ’86, Radcliffe Union of Students President in 1985, said of the cases. But she added that “one positive thing that came out of them was conversation. People were talking about sexual harassment.”The Dominguez incident was closely followed by a University-wide survey of student, faculty, and staff experiences with sexual harassment, that was spearheaded by Verba, who was then the dean of undergraduate education and an academic expert in political polling methodologies.“The survey raised people’s consciousness as a way of finding what was going on campus. That led to greater awareness of the issue on the part of students and faculty,” Verba said.Indeed, just a month after the Dominguez case appeared on its radar, the administration released the results of the survey—one-third of all female students reported experiencing sexual harassment at Harvard, but almost none of these women was willing to file a formal complaint.“Things were more under the table [in the 1980s],” said Gabrielle Gropman, a member of Harvard’s departmental staff. “If there was an incident of harassment at the time, it would be very likely that a woman wouldn’t know where to turn.”The University set out to develop an administrative procedure for investigating reports of harassment, a structure which prior to 1984 was virtually non-existent. But the survey, which revealed incidents ranging from criminal assault to inappropriate joking on the part of male authority figures, was unable to offer a single, comprehensive definition of sexual harassment for campus officials.According to Verba, one challenge of creating a sexual harassment policy, then, was to distinguish between criminal offenses and more casual cases of insensitivity, while at the same time discouraging both with equal seriousness.Verba’s work was a pivotal component of the effort to raise awareness on campus and encourage a shift away from the passive recognition of previous generations toward outspoken condemnation.“We were changing a whole culture in which it was okay to have dates with your students and it was okay to have long private conversations with female students behind closed doors,” said Putnam, adding that he now keeps the door open when he meets privately with female students.But despite the success in attracting new attention to harassment, Pellegrini notes that the victory is only a partial one. “It’s obviously important for the college to have sexual harassment policies and guidelines,” Pellegrini said. “But if colleges and universities think this addresses the problem of gender hierarchy, they’re wrong. Sexual harassment is part of gender hierarchy but it’s not isolable from larger questions about women in the university.”THE LEGACY OF A TRANSFORMATIONBy the end of the 1984, calls for a central office to address harassment concerns were reinforced by the recommendation that the University create and ombudsman officethat would serve to codify harassment procedures and offer a clear resource in addition to the department heads, senior tutors, and advisers who were already available to handle potential complaints.Gropman said that the fruits of these labors is a Harvard much more aware of harassment when she retired in 2003 than when she first arrived in in 1983.Few sexual harassment cases have been publicized at since the mid-1980s, but Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Director Sarah Rankin said that harassment still happens.According to Rankin, current cases remain private because the University’s sexual harassment policies have improved so students can resolve their problems within the system rather than outside of it.The Faculty of Arts and Sciences now publishes an official set of procedures for harassment complaints, and there are designated sexual harassment officers who can counsel victims and guide them through the formalities of addressing their grievances.“I do think it’s a good process,” said Director of the Harvard College Women’s Center Susan B. Marine, who is currently the designated officer for undergraduates. “I’ve seen it work before and I think it was manageable for the students involved.”But since Marine became the designated officer in January, no undergraduate has come to her regarding sexual harassment.Putnam, chair of the Government Department at the time of the Dominguez allegations, said he knows of no sexual harassment cases within the department since the mid-1980s, and he attributes the rarity of these incidents in recent years to a shift in societal norms.“Its a lot like the civil rights revolution--once its all over, you think how could people have tolerated having separate drinking fountains for black and white people? How could anybody have allowed a situation where women who were students would be exploited by older men?” said Putnam.But Marine and Rankin also emphasize that many students may still experience harassment but not come forward. According to Rankin students may be afraid of burning bridges if they complain about faculty members, especially if they want recommendations from professors.Still, Marine agrees that harassment is probably rarer now than in the 1980s.“There’s much more clarity now about what’s legal and not legal, what’s advisable and not advisable, in terms of how faculty and students interact,” Marine said.Putnam’s retrospective echoed a similar sentiment. “The women who are coming back to celebrate their 25th represent that cohort in American life as we were moving from one oldermale-dominated world into a world that is more gender-blind,” Putnam said.—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu—Staff writer Danielle J.
