After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a time of economic austerity when many Harvard workers and employees have lost their jobs and when executive compensation has still managed to increase, the University celebrated its 375th birthday in a rainy soiree fit for a king.
After months of planning, the University put on quite the party: Aside from a torrential downpour, a solo performance of “Happy Birthday” by famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, and grand “voices” from Harvard’s stories past broadcast from the trees, the thousands of attendees were treated to an open bar and, best of all, a giant red velvet cake in the shape of an H that served 5,000.
Although the University has yet to release the exact amount of the party’s cost, the figure, according to the University Marshal, “ran in the thousands, not millions.” (It seems unlikely, of course, that “thousands” in this case actually means a four-digit number). In the perception of the University, of course, this particular celebration was a tasteful, economized affair—far more subdued, for instance, than the lavish extravaganza that marked its 350th in 1986, which consisted of an appearance from Prince Charles, some 50,000 attendees, and, in the words of a news report from the time, “a two-tiered, tubular, helium-inflated Mylar arch that spanned the Charles like a rainbow.”
Given last week’s affair, we wouldn’t dispute that the 350th anniversary was far more excessive. Even still, however, we felt that the event’s tone, whether inadvertent or not, was one of excess and abundance in a time when the University has made so many cuts that have affected the livelihoods of so many. Regardless of the cost of the celebration or whether it was less obnoxious than its counterpart 25 years before, we regret that the University chose to put forth such a garish image at a time as austere as this one. Did the obvious symbolism of an enormous, decadent cake occur to no one involved in this celebration’s planning? While that seems hard to believe, we were nevertheless embarrassed that, at a moment dedicated to the celebration of its past, Harvard opted to tell the world not of a bright future ahead but instead to allude to a bygone era of the utmost extravagance. In our view, the entire event can be encapsulated in the four little words that made the legend of Marie Antoinette famous: “Let them eat cake.”
More importantly, however, Harvard’s 375th birthday was an opportunity for the University to celebrate and interpret its past as a whole, not to weave isolated, select elements of glory into an artificial narrative. It should go without saying that in the last three and three-quarter centuries, Harvard has changed dramatically in every respect—in terms of purpose, mission, and composure. This was an opportunity to embrace that history in all of its complexity, for better and for worse, and we hope that, in its future celebrations, Harvard addresses its past—and its future image—in a more responsible, appropriate way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Occupy Wall Street movement has gained impressive momentum over the past month, and, although the demands and agenda of activists have been criticized as disjointed and ambiguous, the motivating conviction that America’s 99 percent will no longer tolerate the greed of the wealthiest one percent has unified the diverse collective in their fight. The Occupy movement represents a critical shift in public discourse: People are no longer willing to stand by as capitalist institutions continue to profit and the majority of the global poor continue to suffer. But while the Occupy movement may effectively alter the political landscape, activists must not be afraid to wield more conventional forms of activism with specific, targeted demands, and a willingness to negotiate with the existing actors embedded in the status quo. Pharmaceutical companies are one of many oft-neglected but long-standing forces in today’s capitalist reality.
The Medicines Patent Pool campaign, coined at Harvard as the “Say Yes to (AIDS) Drugs” campaign, promotes realistic alternatives to corporate profiteering. The Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition has mobilized students and faculty across disciplines to rally around the Pool’s promise to bring about tangible, empirical change by improving access to AIDS medicines.
The Medicines Patent Pool was established by UNITAID to encourage pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily share their patents for AIDS drugs, allowing more affordable and more adapted versions of patented drugs to be produced generically long before the typical 20-year patent runs out. By fostering increased competition for production and distribution, the Pool achieves price reductions while still operating within the current intellectual property framework, compensating antiretroviral patent holders with royalties as appropriate. Thus, profits are still reaped while those currently suffering with AIDS in inaccessible regions of the developing world receive lifesaving treatment.
With laboratories adjacent to Harvard Medical School, the pharmaceutical company Merck holds the license to the key antiretroviral drugs efavirenz and raltegravir. Despite Merck’s professed commitment to global health, its leadership has repeatedly rejected solicitations from the Medicines Patent Pool Foundation. Merck’s current approach to reducing the price of its brand-name AIDS drug, ISENTRESS, in Sub-Saharan Africa yields an insufficient price decrease compared to generic competition, is too limited in geographic scope considering the global burden of disease, and lacks long-term accountability. Moreover, just this past July, Merck ended its price discounts for 49 middle-income countries. Joining the Pool would ensure a lasting commitment to providing affordable generic medicines to people living in low-and middle-income countries and holding a collective of pharmaceutical companies accountable.
The Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition has already begun mobilizing a coalition of students, faculty members, medical researchers, people living with AIDS, and local community members, all dedicated to prioritizing lives over profit. Over the next months, student activists will organize rallies, collect petition signatures, and meet with Merck’s Corporate Responsibility division. “Pool Party” demonstrations where activists plan to don swimsuits at Merck’s laboratories represent just one bit of the momentous movement to come. For now more than ever, AIDS has become a manageable, global problem to tackle.
The past year has witnessed a man cured of HIV infection, a new microbicide showing positive results, and a research study that examined two novel ways to use antiretroviral drugs. The HPTN052 study witnessed a 96 percent drop in infection rates when people with HIV started their antiretroviral therapy as soon as they were diagnosed. A trial led by the Centers for Disease Control also proved that giving one antiretroviral pill a day to people without HIV lowers the risk of catching it by two-thirds or more. Finally, a recent study led by Harvard researchers showed that investing in AIDS treatment pays back between 81 and 287 percent within just ten years, through increased labor productivity, delayed end-of-life care, and keeping children from needing to draw on orphan care funding. Activists have pieced these facts together and are determined to increase access to life-saving and cost-effective treatment across the developing world.
The Pool campaign is illustrative of much more than an attempt to foster the delivery of healthcare, balancing public and private investments. For the moment that these pharmaceutical companies become more obviously part of the access to medicines discourse, they will also be held more strongly accountable. This is a turning point in history that will cultivate the intersection of the private and public sectors, perhaps even transitioning the directionality of power. Considering the current economic climate and the obstacles to funding social programs, activists must not only radically transform the political landscape, but in the meantime, we must be willing and able to provide innovative mechanisms like the Medicines Patent Pool that persuade corporate actors to become actual do-gooders in society, however slowly.

I loved the trailer for the recently released political thriller, “Ides of March”—it raced through quickly, it tinged with duplicity, and it was chock-full of patriotic campaign sound bytes. I thought it was only a dramatized, fictionalized depiction of reality. And then I saw Texas Governor Rick Perry’s recent campaign advertisement.
Perry’s advertisement against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was even more dramatic than the trailer for the George Clooney-directed film. With flashes of voices—I couldn’t even say that they were full sentences—the YouTube spot, which debuted last Sunday, seemed to be advertising a James Bond movie more than a potential Republican presidential candidate. I was half-expecting Perry to jump off a helicopter, belle in hand, as he deftly cuts the red wire to a bomb threatening to explode half of London—all in a dashing tuxedo. Or at least for him to zip down in an Aston Martin.
Perry even picked up on the more recent tween fascination with ghosts and vampires. Comparing the recent national healthcare reform bill to Romney’s Massachusetts state health care bill, the trailer even has Romney looking into a mirror, only to turn into—gasp—Obama. I’m suspecting that the ostensible blood-sucking part is being saved for the next trailer, when he tries to convince Independents that raising the debt ceiling is going to drain diligent taxpayers of their money for Obama’s costly plans (never mind that President George Bush raised our national debt by over $6 trillion of the current $14.8 trillion, with President Obama only increasing our debt by an equivalent of $4 trillion, when adjusted for an eight-year tenure).
The best part: The ad ends with an out-of-context quotation from Romney, keeping the first part of the line, “There are a lot of reasons not to elect me” and choosing to edit out the second part, “There are a lot of reasons not to elect other people on the stage.” The worst part: This isn’t Perry’s first thriller ad.
Perry made his first entrance into the world of Hollywood politics last September, with his ad criticizing Obama’s lackluster performance in creating jobs. This trailer is the real deal. A real summer blockbuster. Imagine if Harry Potter were to apparate into Gotham City, just in time to stop the Joker. Perry’s trailer literally flashes: “In 2012 … America will discover … A new name for leadership … An American … Who Served for Freedom … A president … Who will lead a nation.” I’m hoping in the next one, they flash, “The last of his kind … Will risk everything … For mankind.” I think they may have done that already for “The Last Airbender.” I hear that movie did really well at the box office.
You can analyze the commercials to no end: These ads’ roaring soundtracks show a want of American voters for extraordinary, theatrical heroes for leadership. Their dramatizing messages marginalize real policy discussion in favor of superficial conversation about production lighting. Their flashing one-liners demonstrate the limited attention span of most of the populace.
These commercials are fun watches but are daunting in their depiction of American politics. If the national elections do become this theatrical, I’m not really sure where the platform for discussion on policy will go. Debates are fine, but I’m concerned about the increasing importance of political ads that even got Obama into office.
I hope I haven’t gotten you too excited, though, with the coming attractions. I forgot to mention that Perry’s upcoming thriller might be a horror film.

Pizza baron Herman Cain has somehow wedged his way into the top tier of the Republican primary field in the past weeks. With a calculated mix of straight talk and business-minded efficiency, the Koch brother darling and former Godfather’s Pizza chief executive has elbowed his way past the Perrys and Bachmanns into the new hype-candidate-of-the-month slot. The centerpiece of his platform is his 999 Plan to simplify taxation, but what he presents as a no-nonsense policy is in fact a thinly-veiled attempt to create a regressive tax code.
His proposal is very succinct: Replace the heart of the current tax code with a flat nine percent tax on business transactions, labor (non-investment) income, and sales tax. The problem with the 999 Plan is that it is reductive and facile and pretends to be egalitarian when in fact it is elitist. Much like many other “solutions” proposed by prominent conservatives in recent months, it takes a very complicated problem and gives it a slogan-length solution.
Herman Cain is a businessman, and he understands the value of a good, simple slogan. In fact, the verbal breeziness of his taxation policy bears a striking resemblance to a promotion by one of his pizza-industry competitots—remember Domino’s “5-5-5 Deal” a couple years back?
But Cain’s proposal is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He states that for many people, taxes will go down. He also says that it will eliminate the much-derided concept of double taxation. In reality, only for the upper tax brackets and corporations will the burden of taxation decrease, while for the average family, the 999 Plan will raise taxes by sapping the same income in triplicate.
Those on the lower end of the income spectrum will go from paying perhaps zero percent to up to 27 percent. The reasoning goes like this: for the average American, the bulk of income comes from wages earned. Investment income, which is most important only for those wealthy Americans who have enough wealth to invest beyond for retirement, is exempted. Then, every purchase that this average earner makes will be struck again by the newly-implemented federal sales tax. The lower the income of a family, the higher the percentage of that income will be spent on consumption of goods. Someone making millions a year cannot possibly spend that much and therefore be hit by the sales tax, but a family making $40,000 a year will likely have every cent of that affected by the sales tax. Finally, the business transactions tax will be passed onto the laborer in the form of lower wages because it amounts to little more than a value-added tax. So there we have it: the 999 Plan is nothing more than a 27 percent flat payroll tax.
However, many of those who advocate a flat tax do so because they abhor the concept of progressive taxation. The members of Congress who refused to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthiest citizens are largely the same ones who support a flat tax, and for the same reason. The reason we have a progressive tax system at all is based on the idea that a one percent increase in income tax is much less painful for someone who is making seven figures than for someone who is making five.
Cain’s tax is therefore not progressive in the slightest. It is regressive in that someone who makes little more than he or she needs to spend in order to survive will pay a higher rate of taxation than someone who lives off of a fraction of his or her income. While he claims that he is pursuing a broader tax base, he is merely shifting the heavy lifting of revenue generation to those who can afford it least.
Cain’s appeal to voters lies in his perceived lack of misleading and superfluous rhetoric. He presents himself as a straight shooter, and his campaign slogan of “Let’s Get Real” is diametrically opposed to “Change We Can Believe In”-esque idealism. His rise to stardom is itself the culmination of the anti-2008 counterrevolution that so many Republicans hope for: Cain is the anti-Obama. He speaks not in grand rhetoric that glosses over his complicated solutions, but rather in simple solutions that gloss over complicated problems.
The godfather of Godfather’s is making offers the American people must refuse.

News reporter Jose A. DelReal shares vignettes from his night on the beat at Occupy Boston.
I.
The march walks by one of those big banks in the Financial District. You  know the ones. Just outside the doors are two tall, white young men  sipping iced coffee from Starbucks. They’re both wearing suits. There’s  so much energy on the street. They’re not chanting, but maybe they feel  it too.
II.
The girl speaking on the steps seems pretty shy. Seems like  she has a nice, steady head on her shoulders. “I’m out here because,  well, WHAT THE FUCK ELSE AM I GOING TO DO!?”
III.
Hey officer,  how’s your night going, I ask. Can I stand on this sidewalk without  getting arrested? No response. Hey, what do you think about all the  commotion? Silence. I head back towards the music and wait.
IV.
The cops are lined up in two rows, a hundred of them, ready  to march into the crowd. No one’s backing down. Drums beat out a  rhythm—steady, steady, steady.
V.
The tents are all gone;  people are standing around, unsure what’s next.  The cops gather in a  corner and prepare to leave. It’s 3:30 in the morning. They aren’t bad  people, neither are the protestors. It would all be demoralizing except  for the adrenaline. The cabs are going by on Purchase Street.

While keeping an optimistic view of the current financial instability in the Euro Zone, a panel of experts at an Institute of Politics panel last night agreed that more international coordination—especially of regulation—is needed prevent future economic crises.
Still, panelist David S. Muir, previously director of political strategy for former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, questioned whether Europe would stabilize.
“Are the Europeans going to sort this out? The more I look into it, the more I think don’t think it will happen,” he said.
While European leaders passed €400 billion of funding in July to address the Greek debt crisis, the measure did not deal with economic issues of Spain and Italy.
“The revealed preference of the European leader is to talk tough, but act weak,” Muir said.
As for American understanding of the Greece crisis, Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Richard Parker noted that many Americans misunderstand the economic problems Greece faces.
“I am constantly stunned at the shallowness of market commentators on the Greek economy,” he said. According to Parker, the key issue is servicing the accumulated debt, a cost that exceeds total civil service wages and creates tensions by necessitating government job cuts.
“If you can calm the market down and deal with the debt crisis in Greece and Portugal ... I think you got a good chance that you will get past the problems in Spain and Italy,” Parker added. “I’m guardedly optimistic.”
Still, a package to address these issues will likely need to not only address issues with private bonds but also bank recapitalization, the panelists said.
“The important thing is globally coordinating a response to [the crisis],” Muir said. “Unless we can deal with this on a global basis, we are likely to continue seeing financial crisis.”
Still, some panelists argued that the basis for further global cooperation is already underway. John C. Dugan, former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, argued that policies such as raising capital requirements for banks involved global coordination.
“These made very significant changes that made banks safer on a go-forward basis,” Dugan said.
A possible step further along global cooperation in the crisis would involve international regulation of businesses.
“If we can coordinate capital, we should be able to coordinate oversight,” said Barbara A. Rehm, editor at large of American Banker magazine.
Parker said that the European Union summit in Brussels later this week will be important, as European governments are capable of providing a backstop for banks and sovereign debts.
Last night’s panel was entitled “Financial Crisis Déjà Vu,” but one panelist took issue with the implications of the name.
“It’s not déjà vu because [the crisis] never really went away,” Muir said.
Though many policies have targeted immediate symptoms and the need for more safety nets against future crises, the fundamental drivers of economic crisis remain, Muir argued.
In this financial crisis, Muir said “There’s too much focus on the ‘safety belt’ and not enough focus on the car.”

Matthew G. Walker, Hubble Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, recently published findings that challenge the standard cosmological model of dark matter in galaxies.
He found—along with co-author Jorge Peñarrubia of the University of Cambridge—that dark matter exists in a smooth distribution, rather than in a dense concentration within galaxies. These findings, recently published by The Astrophysical Journal, were part of an observational study that examined two dwarf galaxies with a high proportion of dark matter.
Dark matter, which is undetectable except for its gravitational pull, has fascinated scientists for decades. Some scientists believe the material binds components of the universe together and determines the structure and evolution of galaxies.
“It wouldn’t be surprising if dark matter turns out to be more complicated than people expected,” said Harvard Ph.D. student Andrew S. Friedman. “Results like this indicate that something is missing.”
Current simulations of dark matter predict that cold dark matter particles conglomerate at the center of galaxies. These simulations do not include the presence of stars, gas, and other particles in galaxies.
“There are many computer simulations about dark matter,” Walker said. “I took an observational approach and compared what I saw to the simulations.”
Walker and Peñarrubia studied the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf galaxies, which sport low stellar contents and high concentrations of dark matter.
“These galaxies contain between 90 to 99 percent dark matter and can be compared relatively straightforwardly with simulations,” Walker said.
The scientists found that dark matter existed in a relatively even distribution, rather than in a dense grouping, across vast regions within the galaxies.
These findings suggest that normal matter may influence dark matter more than predicted or that dark matter particles may not be as cold as previously believed.
“I think this should be taken as an observational result,” Walker said. “The burden is on the simulations and theories.”
Walker believes that astrophysicists should work to bridge the gap between observational findings and computer simulations.
“I need to observe more galaxies with different types of stars and different levels of stellar content to see if stars are responsible for this discrepancy,” Walker said.
Other astrophysicists agree that more research is necessary before making conclusions about dark matter.
“Cold dark matter has been relatively successful in explaining how galaxies like our Milky Way rotate,” said Michael Wood-Vasey, a scientist at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics. “But we need to understand more.”

Though the rain last Friday may have put a literal damper on the events of Harvard’s 375th anniversary, the weather didn’t stop many students and alumni from storming Tercentary Theater and ringing in the school’s birthday.
Now that the clouds have cleared, however, the aftermath of the massive party is left for the school to clean up.
Tercentary Theater is now partially grassless.
Landscape Services, a group of horticulturists and property maintenance workers responsible for restoring the Yard to its previous state, began repairs on Tuesday.
“Any time there’s an event in the Yard, be it a Commencement or Yardfest, the crew is prepared,” said Tania M. deLuzuriaga, a spokesperson for the University.
DeLuzuriaga predicts that the rain will have little effect on the ability of  Landscape Services to complete the task, as they are always prepared for a large cleanup after an event in the yard.
“If there’s rain, obviously [the cleanup] is going to be worse,” she said.
DeLuzuriaga also said that the large white tents placed in various locations around the Yard in the days leading up to the event were only added after seeing the forecast for inclement weather.
The tents were also a means of keeping one of the party’s main attractions, the cake, intact. The red velvet cake was frosted with Swiss meringue vanilla buttercream and consisted of 63 individual cakes. It was created by Joanne B. Chang ’91.
DeLuzuriaga also reported that the Landscape Services crew would being putting sod on the “areas of the Yard that are basically mud,” since it is now too late in the season to plant grass seeds.
The instillation of sod is partially weather dependent, but barring any rain storms, Landscape Services is hoping to have the repairs done by the end of the week.
According to University Marshal Jackie O’Neill, peak attendance at the event ranged from 15,000 to 18,000 people. She clarified that the cost “ran in the thousands, not millions.”

Mona Mowafi, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health and lecturer in the fall series at the Center For Middle Eastern Studies, said she believes that the energy generated during the revolt in Egypt that began last spring can be harnessed to support a “ground up” revitalization of the nation.
As an Egyptian-American with an extensive background in Public Health, Mowafi said she thought the first 18 days of the revolution showed a palpable renewal of civic engagement. Most notably, Mowafi said, neighborhoods organized local watch groups to defend against the chaos in the streets.
Despite the continuation and recent violence of military rule, Mowafi, who blogged about the revolt for The Huffington Post, is confident that the military has played out its hand.
Mowafi said she believes that Egyptians are still willing to take to the streets. She added that the goals of the continuing revolution, which grew out of the workers’ movement, will outlast political distraction. The goals of the revolt extend beyond politics, she said.
Mowafi, drawing on her recent trips to Cairo, said a beneficial change to the city’s social fabric would be implementing a neighborhood jobs program. She said that this would require socio-economic mapping and tracking of local neighborhoods. Once needs are assessed, focus groups and neighborhood-specific tutorials could build a sense of community while also working to train and ultimately employ the jobless.
Egypt’s youth unemployment rate is currently at 25 percent, according to Mowafi.
Mowafi said she recognizes that her plan for a national participatory jobs program will likely require initial contribution from foreign aid, such as Americorps. Ultimately, however, she believes this role can be filled by the government and private sector. Mowafi said she is optimistic that a community-building approach would contribute to the long-term well-being and democratic aspirations of the country.
She added that public health concerns must be tracked locally, as they vary extensively among neighborhoods.
Egyptian female obesity ranks highest in the Middle East, and such an endemic affects local economic output and inter-generational behaviors, according to Mowafi.
Nearly 10 months after the January revolt, even while military rule delays elections, Mowafi said she has faith in the Egyptian people.
An “all-important reset button” was switched on, she said, rejuvenating what Mowafi characterized as a tradition of neighborliness in the country.
Mowafi said that the “Egyptian psyche has changed indelibly.” She noted that Egyptians now refer to the nation as “our country.”

Harvard University Dining Services hatched a new plan on Monday—effective Oct. 31, all the eggs served in University dining halls will be cage-free.
After conducting a review of its policy toward egg purchases, David P. Davidson, the new managing director of HUDS, announced that shell eggs for hard-boiled or fried eggs, as well as liquid eggs for omelette or scrambled eggs, will come from cage-free hens.
“HUDS has continually monitored the debate regarding cage-free eggs, and customers have expressed a strong interest in this change,” Davidson said in a statement. “With recent savings achieved in HUDS’ administrative overhead, and advantageous pricing, we are able to commit to this conversion in the interests of meeting customer demand.”
According to HUDS Spokesperson Crista Martin, the switch to exclusively cage-free eggs in Harvard’s residential dining, retail dining, and catering will cost about $100,000. However, there will be no increase in cost to students because “the funding comes largely from reduced administrative costs within HUDS,” Martin said. She estimated that HUDS purchases about 1.8 million eggs for use across all three kinds of businesses.
“Switching to cage-free eggs is one of the most important actions a university can take to help oppose cruelty to animals,” said Josh M. Balk, spokesperson for the Humane Society of the United States. “Harvard is ensuring that no eggs are coming from hens confined in barren, wired cages, where they can barely move an inch.”
HUDS switched to cage-free shell eggs in 2007 when then-graduate student AnnaLise S. Hoopes started a campaign urging the University to stop purchasing eggs from caged hens. Due to financial cost, HUDS continued to purchase its liquid eggs from “battery cage” egg farms—massive warehouses where hens are confined in cages “with less space than a single sheet of paper and can’t even spread their wings,” Balk said.
"I think Harvard has a unique opportunity to be a leader in supporting industries that are environmentally sustainable, ethical, and humane in their treatment of animals," Hoopes said. "I'm absolutely thrilled to hear that Harvard has made this decision, and I hope other universities will be inspired to do the same."
Marina N. Bolotnikova ’14, who began a petition at the beginning of last year to push Harvard to complete the switch to exclusively cage-free eggs, said she “freaked out” after receiving an e-mail on Monday about HUDS’ decision.
“I began to doubt myself and think the switch was not going to happen when HUDS kept rejecting the idea,” she said. “I didn’t think it would happen so suddenly. I am so grateful that Harvard is making the change.”
In addition to meeting with HUDS and different student groups to get their endorsement, Bolotnikova—who is a Crimson editorial editor—said she went door-to-door to gather as many supporters as she could. Approximately 5,000 Harvard undergraduate and graduate students signed the petition, she said. Bolotnikova added that she and a group of students also visited President Drew G. Faust’s office hour a couple of weeks ago.
“President Faust encouraged us to keep working with HUDS and to create a dialogue on campus,” she said.
In addition to Harvard, about two-thirds of universities in the U.S. including nearby institutions like Brandeis, Tufts, and Bay State College, have switched to purchasing cage-free eggs in their dining halls, according to Balk.
“Universities across the country should understand how important this core issue of animal cruelty is to their students, faculty, staff, and their alumni community,” Balk said.
In 2007, the Cambridge City Council passed a unanimous resolution urging all establishments in the city to switch to cage-free eggs based “on the inherent cruelty of confining egg-laying hens in battery cages,” according to the Council report.
Battery cages have been banned in several states and in more than 27 countries.
HUDS currently purchases its cage-free shell eggs from New Hampshire-based Pete & Gerry’s Organic Eggs. Beginning at the end of this month, liquid eggs will come from Wisconsin-based Abbotsford Farms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators say they plan to implement another statement of community values next fall, despite reversing course last month on their freshman kindness pledge by taking down publicly posted signatures in freshman dormitories.
“I don’t think we will follow the process that we had in place this year, but I think there’s a commitment to making our institutional values explicit,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Administrators say they have not determined whether that effort will take the form of a values pledge, as it did this year.
In order to assess students’ opinions of the pledge, the yearly freshman survey may include a question about its effect, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said.
“We’re going to evaluate the success of this effort, determine how students felt about it at the end of their freshman year, and then we’ll think about what we might do in future years,” Hammonds said. “We may learn that it didn’t help us accomplish the goal of helping people think about those issues.”
Administrators have already received some feedback. Dingman said that a few entryways wrote to him suggesting that next years’ freshmen have the chance to come up with their own lists of values to sign. Others, he said, were pleased with this year’s pledge and felt that their signing experience was “hijacked” when controversy arose.
“Something that for them had meaning was somehow diminished,” Dingman said.
The pledge, which proctors asked freshmen to sign during Opening Days, said that freshmen would consider their entryways to be places “where the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.”
The documents, with a designated spot for each student to add his signature, were to be hung publicly in freshman dormitories. But criticism ensued, sparked by a blog post by Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former dean of the College and computer science professor, who told The Crimson that a values oath proffered by the College was “very unscholarly.”
Lewis said that because the student signatures were displayed publicly, students might feel pressure to sign. In the wake of the controversy, the College decided to hang the framed documents without signatures, with just the text of the pledge.
Administrators said they stand by the rationale underlying the pledge.
“It was a very good idea on the part of the Freshman Dean’s Office,” Hammonds said. “They had very clear and good reasons for trying to have a conversation in the entryways about expectations of behavior as part of living in a community, including civility, respect for each other, and kindness.”
Other administrators echoed Hammonds’s sentiments.
“We should also be willing to talk about Harvard’s core values, including truth, service, and treating each other with dignity and respect,” said Dean of the Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
She added that she “hope[s] we are able to have that conversation again, next year, even if we adjust and do it a little differently.”
The original pledge came out of a committee of students and administrators, including Dingman.
“I think with any new initiative, in the implementation, there are likely to be some areas that you overlook,” Dingman said. “I think it’s unfortunate that we had those, but I think to accept responsibility for them and to proceed with some humility but determination seems appropriate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they plan modifications to Harvard’s current alcohol policy, College administrators will host a series of discussions aimed at generating student feedback on drinking at Harvard.
The first of these meetings was held in Winthrop JCR on Tuesday night and included students from Eliot, Kirkland, and Winthrop Houses. The discussion was attended by students, tutors, acting Winthrop Resident Dean Luke A. Leafgren, Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe, and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
“We really want to make sure that we hear the voice of the student in this process,” Nelson said.
Discussions will be held with students from several Houses at a time. Freshmen will have a separate meeting in the Yard.
Student input from the meetings will be sent to an alcohol policy committee, which will draft a preliminary version of the updated policy. The policy will ultimately be sent to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds for review and approval.
Nelson said that ideally the Office of Student Life will conclude student discussions by the spring semester and create a draft of the policy by next April.
The alcohol policy committee, composed of students and administrators and chaired by Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana, was formed last year in conjunction with the College’s decision to reevaluate its current policies regarding drinking.
As the committee works to develop an updated policy, administrators have focused on enforcing current rules as well as enacting regulations that more strictly restrict alcohol consumption.
Last semester Hammonds sent a memo to House Masters asking that they focus on implementing current policy more consistently throughout the Houses. Hammonds’ initiatives had an immediate impact as Houses began designating “responsible adults” to serve drinks at House events and Pforzheimer House canceled its semiannual golf event—which involved drinks and food in students’ rooms throughout the House. Pfoho House Masters cited the inability to control who could drink and the game-like nature of the event in their House-wide email that explained the decision.
Around the same time the College mandated that only beer and wine—not hard alcohol—could be served at off-campus formals that semester.
But while the changes last year focused on enforcing the standing regulations, the alcohol conversations that the College will hold over the coming semester aim to generate student input for a potentially sweeping revision of the entire policy.
Nelson said that the College was interested in reevaluating the current alcohol policy in the context of creating a healthy social scene, while recognizing that Harvard is not above the law.
Tuesday’s meeting touched upon many aspects of Harvard’s drinking culture, from drinking games, to party forms, to legality issues surrounding drinking at college.
“The willingness of the administration to listen to what we as students have to say gives me confidence,” said Ari L. Rubin ’13, a vocal participant in the conversation who proposed, among other things, allowing students to engage in safe drinking in House common spaces. “I look forward to the day when I’m able to drink a beer in the JCR.”

What is it with the O’Connor brothers and bikes?
Bicycles seem to bring misfortune to senior Sam O’Connor and junior James O’Connor, top rowers on the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team.
“There’s something about those O’Connors and bike accidents,” junior Josh Hicks said. “We need to keep them away.”
After each rower sustained a bicycle-related injury last year, Sam and James are finally healthy and ready to compete this coming weekend at Head of the Charles.
Not only will the brothers be competing, they will be competing together in the Crimson’s top boat. Sam and James will be rowing in the same boat for the first time in almost a year.
HISTORY
The O’Connor brothers grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Coming from a rowing family, Sam and James each competed in high school.  The brothers excelled and went on to compete together for New Zealand at the World Junior Rowing Championships.
At Harvard, the brothers’ legacies have continued.  Sam rowed in the first varsity eight all spring of his sophomore year, helping his boat to win eastern sprints and the Ladies’ Challenge Plate at the Royal Henley Regatta.  In addition, his boat finished in fourth place at the IRA National Championships.
James also rowed in the first varsity eight his sophomore year, in the bow seat, after rowing in the first freshman eight the previous year.  His boat went undefeated in the dual season, winning the Sprints championship and taking silver at the IRA National Championships.
In the 2010 season, the first time that both O’Connor brothers were enrolled at Harvard, they rowed separately.  It is a team convention that rowers spend their first year competing in freshman boats.
Last year, when the duo was anticipating a full year of rowing together, a shocking incident changed the rowers’ plans for the season.
INJURY
“I was bicycling at home over winter break, approaching an intersection,” Sam described. “A car ran through a red light pretty fast and hit me side-on.  I crashed into the windshield and went flying.”
Sam has only a vague memory of what happened between the crash and waking up in the ambulance.  This freak accident affected mostly his head and shoulders.  Sam went to the hospital in his native New Zealand and was treated for a dislocated shoulder.  When Sam returned to campus in January, he underwent shoulder surgery, causing him to sit out all of the spring season.
Ironically, Sam turned to cycling—the very activity that caused his injury—to help stay in shape when he could not row.  Sam explained that cycling and rowing involve similar engagement of the leg muscles.
“I was training with the cycling team a lot,” Sam noted.  “I enjoyed training with the team but rowing was always my priority.  My goal was to come back as soon as I was in good shape again.”
Sam’s cycling efforts paid off this summer when he won the Minnesota state championships twice.
“He’s just a machine,” Hicks said of Sam. “When he was coming back, he’d be on the stationary bike before you came and after you left … we were always sure that he’d come back fighting fit.”
As Sam’s interest in cycling continued to develop, he turned his brother onto the activity as well.  Sam arranged for James to have a road bike this past summer for his internship in Washington, D.C., but James’ biking also resulted in injury.
“I was biking after work one day in the pouring rain,” James said.  “I hit a pothole and my bike stopped, but I didn’t. I went right over the handlebars. I got up and checked the bike; I figured it was probably more expensive than I am.”
Originally James thought the accident just caused some scrapes and bruises.  But, within a few days, he started experiencing significant pain in the abdomen and had trouble breathing.  James went to the emergency room for an x-ray, which showed he had broken one rib and fractured another.
As both O’Connor brothers fought to overcome injury and return to rowing this season, they relied on each other for support and motivation.
“It is not that often that I’ll ask James to row with me and he will say no, or vice versa,” Sam said. “We train pretty hard.”
REUNITED AND READY TO RACE
Exactly a year ago at the Head of the Charles, the O’Connor brothers competed together to take second place in the Championship Eight event and first at the Tail of the Charles.  Now, Sam and James are healthy again and excited to row this weekend.
“I am just happy to be back racing,” Sam said. “I am looking forward to more of that this season.”
Two particular members of the Head of the Charles crowd will make the race an even more special event for the brothers.
“We are excited to have Mom and Dad here this weekend,” James shared.  “This is the first time our mom is visiting us at college.”
With a bit of reluctance, both Sam and James admitted to having bikes on campus.
Hopefully, the brothers will wear their helmets and use caution the next time they head out for a ride.

For most people, mistakenly going to the wrong practice might ruin your day. But for Lucy Grinalds, a freshman on Radcliffe heavyweight crew, the mishap may have completely changed her life.
“I thought I was going to kayaking practice for about the first two weeks,” Grinalds said.  “And then I realized once I was on the water that it was nothing like kayaking.”
In fact, Grinalds did not even like rowing when she first started in 2005. It wasn’t until about a year later, after Grinalds had started working harder at the sport, that she finally started warming up to rowing.
Her rowing career has since excelled. She joined the Junior National Team in 2008 and spent four years on the squad before coming to Harvard as a freshman in 2011.
After losing a tight race to New Zealand in the 2010 World Rowing Junior Championships, Grinalds had one main goal in mind before she competed in her most recent Junior Championships this past summer in Eton, England: get to the top of the podium.
In her last year on the team, Grinalds won the United States’ first gold medal in the straight four in over a decade.
“My most memorable sporting achievement would definitely be this summer winning the Junior Worlds in London,” Grinalds said. “I’d really been trying for the past four years, and the year before that we got edged out by New Zealand by .8 of a second, so the entire year I was really training with that goal in mind.”
While her list of successes and accomplishments before coming to Harvard is hard to be matched, Grinalds now has turned her immediate focus to Radcliffe Crew.
“Currently I really want to win an NCAA Championship, [a] team championship,” Grinalds said. “That’s really going to require the entire team to just put their best foot forward all year with every stroke.”
If Harvard to achieve this feat, Grinalds will have to be a big part of it.
“She brings a lot of experience,” said junior Shelley Pearson, who rowed with Grinalds for two summers on the Junior National Team. “She’s been on the water, high pressure starting lines, and I think that she knows how to handle it and she’ll definitely bring the experience that she’s had at the international level.”
“She is definitely one of the fittest girls on our team,” co-captain Kirsten Van Fossen said. “She came in off of the Junior National Team, so she was doing lots of work this summer … We’re really happy to have her.”
Even as a first-semester freshman, Grinalds has been able to make a smooth transition to the team.
“She has a great personality; she’s one of the bubbliest freshman in the boat house,” Van Fossen said. “You don’t even feel like she’s a new member—it feels like she’s been here for over a year now.”
“It wasn’t that hard of a transition for me because I came off training for the World Championships,” Grinalds added. “The only difference is having to keep up with your school work and having two practices a day tends to be kind of a little bit overwhelming occasionally.”
Grinalds’ most recent honor was being chosen as one of five nominees for the USRowing Fan’s Choice Award for Junior Rower of the Year.
According to USRowing, the basis for nomination is “A male or female rower or coxswain who has achieved extraordinary success in 2011. Success may be defined as an outstanding performance, having a breakout year, perseverance in spite of difficult odds, consistent strong performance, outstanding service off the water, a combination of the above or other worthy measures.”
“I’m hoping that maybe I can get a couple of votes,” Grinald said. “But I was just really excited to be nominated.”
This year is the first USRowing Fan’s Choice Awards, which includes an online voting process open through October 28.
While Grinalds has set her short-term goals on being a teammate at Harvard and helping Radcliffe crew find success, she still has long-term goals to be the best.
“I also want to go the Olympics in 2016 and hopefully win gold,” she said. “That’s my main rowing goal, so we’ll see.”

In lieu of participating in the 375th festivities, selected players of the Harvard men’s tennis team were hard at work, playing a combined total of 20 matches against some of the best college tennis players the Northeast has to offer.
More players on the court spelled more success for the squad at the ITA Men’s Northeast Regional Championship in Ithaca, N.Y. this past weekend. While the Crimson’s singles players faltered early in the tournament, lasting from last Thursday until yesterday, its doubles players achieved success, with one doubles team reaching the finals in a field of 64 teams.
Co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster lost in the finals to Princeton’s Matt Slow and Matt Spindler. The duo’s trip to the finals came as a bit of a surprise to the field, or at least to the drawmakers, who had the pair seeded third.
But the run to the finals was still bittersweet for the Crimson.
“Although Casey and I made the final of the doubles, it was somewhat disappointing because only the winner goes through to nationals,” Felton said. “We didn’t play badly, but the Princeton team just played one amazing return game.”
Felton and MacMaster’s toughest challenge en route to the championship came from the duo of Milo Hauk and Gustav Kallen from St. John's, who took them to a tiebreak, which Harvard won, 7-3.
The eighth-ranked pairing of junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen also had a relatively strong showing, losing a 9-7 match to Yale’s top team, Daniel Hoffman and Mark Powers—the tournament’s second seed.
Of the six Crimson singles competitors, four of them—Felton, MacMaster, and freshmen Shaun Chaudhuri and Alex Steinroeder—lost in the Round of 64. Only Steinroeder, seeded ninth, was favored to win his Round of 64 matchup. He fell in straight sets to freshman Quoc-Daniel Nguyen of Cornell who advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to sixth-seeded Powers.
The remaining two singles players, senior Jonathan Pearlman, the top seed in the tournament, and Denis Nguyen, lasted until the round of 16 where they each fell in closely contested matches. Pearlman’s matchup went to the third set where 17th-seeded Ivan Turudic of Penn had just one break too many.
“I’m not upset with the loss,” Pearlman said of the three-hour marathon match. “It was obviously disappointing given the ranking … I give my opponent a lot of credit. He was serving very well.”
According to Pearlman, the singles team, which has not won the Ivy League title since before the senior class’ time, still has a long way to go in order to be competitive in the spring.
“I think the team as a whole is doing well, but from a singles standpoint the team is going to need to get a lot sharper,” Pearlman said. “Guys need to keep working on their game and improve to get to where the team needs to be.”
Besides Felton and MacMaster’s, performance, Denis Nguyen was the standout of the tournament with a strong showing in both the singles and doubles draws. With a backhand that literally took the racquet out of his Yale opponent’s hands, the Anaheim native displayed his characteristic power and pizzazz.
According to team members, the speed of Cornell’s indoor courts, unusual for courts in the Northeast, was also an obstacle for the team, which is just starting its indoor season.
Like Felton and Macmaster’s finals match, the sentiment is bittersweet for the Crimson right now, but things are looking up.
“I think our team is looking a little better in doubles,” Felton said. “But overall, I’m confident that we can put together a strong charge in the Ivies this year, having seen the opposition this week.”

No new teams broke into the top five this week, but the top four squads traded places in a weekend filled with crushing victories and tough defeats.
5. Women’s Volleyball (10-7, 3-4 Ivy)
 
Harvard lost to Cornell and defeated Columbia last weekend. Taylor Docter smacked the Lions out of the gym, recording five aces in the league victory.
 
Previous Rank: 5
 
4. Women’s Tennis
The Crimson did not see any action last week. The team will compete at the ITA Regional Tournament in New Haven, Connecticut this weekend.
Previous Rank: 3
3. Sailing
 
The sailing team overcame last week’s shipwreck to take third place at the Lark Invitational at Tufts. The team will compete in five regattas next weekend.
Previous Rank: 4
2. Women’s Golf
 
The Crimson took second place in the Harvard Invitational, falling to Penn by just 5 strokes. The rain and wind were unforgiving, as battling the elements is not something that five of the team’s players from California are used to.
Previous Rank: 1
1. Football (4-1, 3-0 Ivy)
 
The Crimson continues to roll, picking up its fourth consecutive victory last weekend. Colton Chapple was spectacular again, throwing for five touchdowns. The Crimson battle Princeton on Saturday in a game that could be less competitive than Shaq in a free throw shooting competition.
Previous Rank: 2

Steven C. Schlozman, Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, spoke yesterday at a seminar hosted by The Harvard Society for Mind, Brian and Behavior. The event was nothing like one would have expected on a Monday afternoon in Barker Center. Entitled "How to Inadvertently Learn Some Neuroscience While Preparing For (The Inevitable) Zombie Apocalypse," the seminar gave students tips on how to hypothetically deal with zombies, and debunked some misrepresented Hollywood horror myths through neuroscience.
Schlozman, who wrote a fake medical paper in 2009 on what the brain of a zombie would be like, began the seminar by projecting a gruesome image from the film "Dawn of the Dead" for the room to see.
"Video game zombies tell only half of the story," he said. "To truly understand a zombie, we must actually acknowledge the science behind their creation."
Throughout the lecture, Schlozman cleverly used the appeal of this pre-Halloween, supernatural theme as a gateway into a broader discussion of neuroscience. Approaching the topic as he would for a research paper, the Brown-Dartmouth graduate incorporated information from zombie history, literature, and cinema.
"It's a great modality to talk about aspects of neuroscience," said Schlozman, who takes every opportunity to intertwine his interest in zombies with the study of the brain.
Punctuating his analyses with neurological insights during his talk, for instance, he made a key distinction between "slow-moving" and "fast-moving" zombies.
Without fully functioning brains it is impossible for zombies to move quickly and deftly, says Schlozman. This would require an intact cerebellum and basal ganglia, decent depth perception, and higher cortical processes—all of which, he reasoned, an average zombie would not have.
Additionally, by offering eight tips for surviving a zombie attack, Schlozman also successfully integrated a lesson on brain structure, a brief discussion on the story of Phineas Gage, and the function of the amygdala in impulsive decision-making.
Students who attended the seminar were intrigued by Schlozman’s examination of the undead.
"It was really interesting to see the incorporation of an actual science in a fictional world," said Kenneth Mai '15.

Looking for a platform to voice your political opinions, to debate, or to amass a following? PolicyMic.com, recently started by two College alumni, offers this and more for the politically active mind. Christopher Altchek '09 and Josh Nuni '10, along with Stanford alum Jake Horowitz, have been debating each other since childhood, and decided they wanted to share their passion for politics with the world."The website's inspiration came after having one of those debates a year ago in New York," Altchek said. "We realized not enough people we know have those honest debates where they can hear the other side of the debate and learn where their argument is strong or weak."
A PolicyMic user starts out as a reader responding to other members' articles.  The member then begins to accumulate points, or as the site refers to as "mics."  The more mics you gain, the more you can do on the website.  After a user earns enough mics they then become a contributor, followed by a commentator, and finally a "Pundit".  PolicyMic Pundits can challenge others to debates and write articles, developing an audience in the process.
"PolicyMic incorporates an element of fun into the debate system," Altcheck said.
The founders hope the site will play an important role in the elections for today's generation.

Sometimes, clichés are accurate: midterms are indeed a pain in the neck.
After hunching in front of laptops and straining over textbooks, everyone could use a tender touch. Tomorrow in the Junior Common Room in Leverett, 14 lucky House residents will get just that, as they join Dawn E. Slack, a licensed massage therapist from Harvard's Center for Wellness, for cupcakes, Berryline, music, and massages. Spots filled quickly for this program, which the Leverett wellness tutors organized to help ease their students' tensions.So what about the other six thousand or so stressed undergrads who can't attend?  "Sleep and eat well!" advises Leverett wellness tutor Melissa Leger in an email. Not quite as glamorous as a massage, maybe, but your mother told you right.
And you may just have to get that cutie from Leverett to fill you in on what you missed—you know, for your health.

Let's face it: some of us secretly wish we could still go trick-or-treating. Well, members of the Harvard chapter of Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children have created an alternative for us old fogeys, where the candy comes to your door.
The organization is selling Spook-o-Grams, bags of candy with a personalized message. The goody bags—which cost $3, or two for $5—include M&Ms, Hershey bars, and Twizzlers. Recipients will find the Spook-o-Grams in their dropboxes on Halloween morning.
Josephine Volovetz '14, who is also a Crimson editor, came up with the idea as a way to raise money for a trip that FIMRC members will be taking to Costa Rica in January to volunteer at a health clinic.
Students can order the candy grams online or visit the table that FIMRC will host in front of the Science Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. during the last week of October and in Annenberg on Oct. 24, 26, and 27.

Every fall, students and visitors from all corners of the world come together for the annual Head of the Charles Regatta. Some  come to see the clashes on the water. Others are taking in the  spectacle of pastel clothing and autumn foliage. A few are just  searching for free Nantucket Nectar samples.
Whether you're there to people-watch, grab a bite, or catch the races, you'll need these pointers to have a grand experience at the Regatta.
The basics: The Regatta runs from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. this Saturday and Sunday. There are 55 different events, all of which follow a 3-mile course on the Charles beginning at the Boston University Boathouse and ending six bridges later at Artesani Park in Brighton. Competitors include over 8,000 male and female rowers in youth to veteran age groups, representing over 600 clubs and schools worldwide.
Races to watch: If you're out to see Harvard's rowers compete, plan to come between noon  and 1:45 p.m. on Saturday or between 2:20 and 4:45 p.m. on Sunday.  Another race that will be fun to watch is the parent/child doubles race  scheduled for 4:25 p.m. on Saturday. Click here for the full schedule.
Places to watch: The busiest area will be the intersection of Memorial Drive and JFK Street,  so grab a blanket and shades and stake out a spot on the grass instead. You'll be  out of the way of the crowds but still close to the food stands. Which  brings us to...
Refreshments: This year, official Regatta patrons include Kickass Cupcakes, Clif Bar, Green Mountain Coffee, and Red Bull. Find their tents, because they'll most likely be giving out samples of their products.
 Logistics: Make sure to carry  your ID, because just like last weekend, you'll need it to re-enter the  Yard after dark.
This post has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: Rules for registered parties and overnight guests are more stringent this weekend in many Houses and in freshman dorms
