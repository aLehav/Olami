After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s start with the nose. Some misguided members of the public feel that a normal human nose—a nose that, say, could not be used as a life raft—is preferable to the sprawling organic sculpture that perches atop Mr. Brody’s face. I encourage these individuals to dream larger. Release yourself from the chains of mediocre snout worship and embrace your true feelings: don’t we all want a man who can control the tides by shaking his face? Do we not all, in our heart of hearts, feel more secure walking at night when our companion can smell danger several miles away? He knows you do.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could direct you next to Mr. Brody’s abdominal muscles. There appear to be one million of them. After an informal study of the Internet, I have discovered that Mr. Brody spends a nearly indulgent amount of time on boats—not your everyday boats—but classy skiffs where shirts are about as welcome as pipe bombs. The result is many, many photos of shirtless Brody which form a convincing body of evidence that he sold his soul to Nosestradamus in exchange for a perfect torso.
But what is near-eerie physical perfection without international acclaim and Academy Awards to support it? That’s right—nothing. Thank goodness that Mr. Brody is the only person IN THE UNIVERSE to receive an Academy Award at the tender age of twenty-nine for his role as Wladyslaw Szpilman in Roman Polanski’s heart-breaking film “The Pianist.” According to Wikipedia and several rabid Brody fan-sites, Mr. Brody gave up worldly possessions, was dumped by his (idiotic, ungrateful) girlfriend, lost nearly thirty pounds (roughly half his estimated body weight), and learned how to play Chopin for the role. Never before has the human spirit triumphed over such immeasurable odds. Maybe before. But nothing comes to mind.
Before we lose ourselves in uncontrollable weeping, let’s also recall Mr. Brody’s forays into the world of comedy. It has been suggested by some critics that Mr. Brody’s strengths do not lie in the comedic realm—that he is, in the parlance of our time, nightmarishly unfunny.  I would like to direct these ingrates to his cameo in “Midnight in Paris,” as Salvador Dali, in which he uses the word “rhinoceros” more times in a three-minute scene than it has been said in the entire span of cinematic history. If that’s not hilarious, I don’t know(s) what is.
For my closing argument, I would suggest that we all sit and meditate on how we would feel without Adrien Brody in our lives. Empty? Pointless? Wildly unhappy? Certainly. But there’s something even larger than that—we would be without hope. Without a paragon to show us that there is light and the potential for perfection in this world, we are worms in a sea cave—useless, ugly, and snub-nosed. Let’s not be sea-worms. Let’s gather around the warmth of Mr. Brody and learn to love again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Where are the fiscal conservatives? If you think the answer is the right side of the aisle, think again. Since the mid-1980s, when former Crimson editor Grover G. Norquist ’78 joined forces with President Ronald W. Reagan to push a fanatical anti-tax oath on Republican members of Congress (now signed by 95 percent of Republican congresspeople), the Grand Old Party has been more concerned with depressing revenue than reducing deficits. A true fiscal conservative is one who promotes small deficits, funded spending, and a sober approach to our nation’s finances. By this standard, today’s Republican Party couldn’t be less conservative.
For evidence of the Republican Party’s profligacy, look no farther than the Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003. Costing over $1.5 trillion, the cuts were motivated by a desire to give the Clinton surplus back to the taxpayers rather than to use it to pay down the national debt. Bush and his colleagues in Congress took a rare opportunity to put a dent in our nation’s indebtedness and turned it into an unfunded stimulus package. This is not quite the behavior of a party of debt hawks.
A less discussed but even more severe display of fiscal recklessness came in the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations. One might think it a fundamental tenet of fiscal conservatism to pay one’s debt. Yet in today’s Republican Party, this obligation plays second fiddle to ideological zealotry. House Speaker John A. Boehner played a game of chicken with our nation’s credit, threatening to forgo debt service unless the president and Senate give in to their ideological demands. This is the behavior of radicals, not conservatives.
It is in light of this recent Republican trend of fiscal profligacy that we are heartened to see a few sober voices begin to speak out in favor of a levelheaded approach to reducing the deficit. Senators Lindsey O. Graham, and Saxby Chambliss as well as Representative Peter T. King have all expressed a willingness to raise revenue as part of a deficit reduction deal. While it may seem silly to take hope in just a handful of legislators expressing what should be obvious—that raising revenue is a necessary part of the deficit reduction toolkit—our nation’s recent political history makes their gestures noteworthy.
Regardless of whether Norquist’s anti-tax oath is behind the anti-tax orthodoxy plaguing the Republican Party or merely a symptom of it, we are pleased to see it abate. After all, the only oath to which our governing officials should be beholden is the one they swear during their inauguration. What Norquist considers “impure thoughts”—legislators publically considering breaking with his oath—are in fact what allows our democracy to function. When compromise plays second fiddle to ideological purity, fiscal responsibility is sidelined in favor of public displays of ideological devotion.
If the Republican Party is to reclaim the mantle of fiscal conservatism, then it must remember that paying one’s obligations must come before impressing interest groups. Norquist is happy to see his marginal tax rate lowered. Whether the United States is a reliable debtor is a concern for the rest of us.

The United States is often viewed, both at home and abroad, as a pretty racist country. We are often the butt of European jokes about racism, religiosity, and intelligence. And often times, the United States puts itself out there as an easy target, with characters like
Michelle Bachmann, who objects to evolution on the grounds that "a grain of wheat plus a starfish does not equal a dog," popular YouTube videos such as “stupid Americans,” and right-wing Americans’ obsession with Obama’s apparent adherence to Islam dominating the perception of Americans abroad.
Europeans, in particular, enjoy scoffing at conservative, racist Americans over a pint of beer, plate of sauerkraut, or serving of escargot. But a threatening specter of racism and intolerance is looming over Europe. While Americans took a step forward in social liberalism with their reelection of Obama and rising support for social policies such as gay marriage and immigration reform, politics in Europe has taken a dangerous turn to the right. Although racism and discrimination take a different form in Europe than in the United States, the rise of right-wing ideology in European politics is worrying, particularly given the targeting of minorities by right-wing parties.
Racism in the United States is rooted in a complicated history of slavery and segregation, which has culminated in tense race relations. However, racism in Europe has resurged recently due to a large wave of immigrants from Africa and the Middle East whose cultures and religions are vastly different from those prevalent in many once-homogeneous European societies.
Economic hardship during the recent European economic crisis has triggered the release of pent up anti-immigrant frustration in European politics. In 2010, German chancellor Angela Merkel stated that multiculturalism had “totally failed” in Germany, that “we feel tied to Christian values”, and that “those who don’t accept them don’t have a place here.” This is the distinction between the U.S. and Europe. Although there are many right-wing politicians in the U.S., it is rare for high-ranking lawmakers to make such divisive statements about race and religion, and they would be condemned by a significant sector of society should they make such claims. The parliamentary systems of European nations also allow far-right parties to join ruling coalitions and to use their power to execute discriminatory policies. For example, the right-wing anti-immigration Northern League in Italy, which is a member of Prime Minister Mario Monti’s coalition, has implemented many far-right laws that discriminate against both legal and illegal immigrants.
Not only do European politicians make such deplorable claims, but they also often ride on waves of xenophobia to positions of high power and use them to openly pursue discriminatory policies against minorities. These policies seem to be picking up widespread support among the European mainstream. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s right-wing Front National, ran on a popular anti-immigrant, anti-Islam platform and came third in the tight 2012 presidential election. She polled higher than any far-right candidate has in any prior presidential election in France’s fifth republic. Her leadership has been credited for the party becoming the third largest in France, and she clearly has a future in politics given her young age and burgeoning support.
In Greece’s recent elections, the anti-immigration, neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party made significant gains in parliamentary seats. Golden Dawn promises to lay landmines along the Greco-Turkish border. Its leader has been filmed making Hitler salutes, and their supporters, known as “black shirts,” are responsible for vandalizing immigrant markets in Greece.
The growing support for the right wing in Europe is terrifying, and we must be wary of the future of multiculturalism in Europe: It does not seem that the surge in right-wing fanaticism is a short-term phenomenon. Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations in Paris has summarized the dangerous trend towards the right in Europe: "What we are witnessing is not a new trend, but a deepening and acceleration of something that was in place. These politicians are playing with fire, because feelings on this issue run very deep and may not disappear when the economy recovers."
This is the sharp divide between Europe and the United States. Racism in U.S. politics mostly ends with campaign rhetoric. But racism in Europe translates into dangerous, concrete policies. Without trying to dismiss the role racism plays in American society, politicians here are fortunately not as willing to put racist and anti-immigrant ideologies on paper. Yes, Arizona has an appalling, discriminatory immigration law. But France has gone so far as to prohibit women from wearing the burqa, and the nation routinely deports Roma. Italy punishes people who provide illegal immigrants with shelter. Switzerland has banned the construction of minarets.
As an American citizen who attended a German-British secondary school, I have often stayed silent while my friends make fun of my heritage and my country. But next time I’m back home at the pub with my old classmates and they make fun of me for being an “idiot” or a “racist” because I am American, I’m going to put down my pint and crack a Europeans-hate-minarets-and-Roma joke back.

Principles of Economics. Introduction to Computer Science. Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory. What do these three courses have in common? They’re the three highest enrolled classes at Harvard this semester.
But, as they used to sing on Sesame Street, one of these things is not like the others.
Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” is Harvard’s third most popular class, with 532 students enrolled. This is a new record for the class, but it has been growing for some time. When I took ER 18 my sophomore year, we started in Yenching Auditorium, but unanticipated turnout required the class to move to Sanders Theater shortly after study card day. That semester, 416 students ended up taking the class—clearly far more than were expected, given that Yenching Auditorium has a capacity of 274.
All three of the most popular classes this semester fulfill General Education requirements, but that alone can’t explain their popularity. Quality of instruction is one factor, to be sure: Michael J. Puett, who teaches ER 18, is a famously lively and engaging lecturer. And China’s growing economic and political power may, at some level, play a role. Puett himself attributes the class’s success to its content: students “are looking for courses that help them think big,” he said in an interview.
Indeed, one crucial difference among these three courses relates to how students might think about their content. More specifically, both economics and computer science are, for many students, professional skill-building classes. Both can be exciting glimpses into new ways of thinking about the world with great intrinsic value, but they also point toward career paths that many Harvard students plan to take. The same just can’t be said about Chinese philosophy.
But what does it mean that 532 Harvard students are getting a thorough introduction to the great works of Chinese philosophy? Puett believes that the materials in his course offer startlingly relevant insights into how to think about making choices, including career choices, from a broad perspective that Harvard advising, which Puett describes as “very practical, sometimes to a fault,” does not usually address.
The ideas that he teaches in the class provide a provocative alternative to the model of setting a long-term career goal and planning out steps to attain it. Let’s call that model of good career advice “The Plan.” To Puett, this approach has serious flaws. First, it encourages us to be closed off from and even fearful of new experiences that do not fit into The Plan. Xunzi and Zhuangzi, two Chinese philosophers with wildly different systems of thought, would agree, Puett says, that this mentality makes us focus too narrowly on what we think we can predict rather than open-mindedly accepting what actually happens.
Buying into “The Plan” may in turn make us think too narrowly about our capabilities. Puett believes that “training” matters much more than “natural aptitude,” meaning that while we may be born with certain abilities, we have enormous capacity to develop new skills beyond our original endowments. As a result, if our natural aptitudes do not coincide with our interests, Puett hopes that the ideas in his class will empower students not to follow a path that doesn’t excite us, especially if our justifications are telling ourselves, “this is just what I’m good at,” or, “this is just who I am.”
These remarks on the impact of the class aren’t off the mark, at least according to some students in the class. Jonathan D. Reindollar ’14, an East Asian studies concentrator in ER 18 this semester, said that the class has helped him with “thinking about things holistically and challenging even the most basic preconceptions.”
Puett’s core ideas—that our interests should guide us more than our aptitudes and that training can overcome our natural endowments—are powerful and potentially liberating for students contemplating career choices. Many students I have interviewed for my column this semester told that they feel like their choices about what to do after college are, in certain ways, not their own. Some even say that they feel trapped in their decisions, that, in the words of one economics concentrator who reluctantly accepted her finance offer earlier this fall, it was “too late” to do anything else.
But the great works of Chinese philosophy offer another view. They teach us that “it’s never too late,” Puett said. “With training, you can be extraordinary at nearly anything you choose. The sky is the limit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Angie Epifano’s recent account of sexual assault at Amherst College brought national attention to the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. In an article, she described reporting her sexual assault to the Amherst administration and the administration’s egregious response to her case—which included institutionalizing her against her will and refusing to allow her to study abroad, all while making no effort at all to punish her rapist.
At about the same time, we joined with other Harvard students to start a campaign on campus called Our Harvard Can Do Better. To encourage Harvard to re-examine its sexual assault policies and practices, the campaign put a referendum on the recent Undergraduate Council ballot calling for reform in sexual assault policy. The overwhelming student support that this referendum generated (it passed with 85 percent of the vote) suggests that undergraduates are alarmed at aspects of Harvard’s policy, including the use of the phrase “mental incapacitation” without an explanation of exactly what this means and Harvard’s lack of a policy of affirmative consent.
However, while the referendum was mainly policy-driven, what lies at the heart of sexual assault issues on campuses everywhere is the ubiquity and persistence of rape culture, a societal attitude that delegitimizes sexual violence and predisposes people to excuse rapists. Furthermore, this culture creates a general understanding of sexual violence that is limited to heterosexual relationships, thereby delegitimizing non-heterosexual violence. Unfortunately, rape culture is an inescapable aspect of American life today.
A central feature of rape culture is that the main burden of rape prevention is put on potential victims rather than on potential perpetrators, and alleged instances of this can be found on our campus. For example, Johany Pilar, who works in the Freshman Mailroom, told students and coworkers last month that she was sexually harassed at work. Pilar says that when she reported this, she was told that it was probably because she gave too many hugs. This is a prime example of victim-blaming, which happens when people suggest that victims are assaulted because they have not “done enough” to prevent assault. This focuses attention away from the fact that the aggressor acted by their own volition. And unfortunately, stories like Johany Pilar’s—stories that demonstrate the ways in which sexual assault is normalized and explained away in our society—are all too common.
Rape culture is real at Harvard, and is perhaps even more pervasive on campus due to Harvard’s history as an all-male institution. We reinforce rape culture through the ways that we conduct ourselves every day, especially through our language. Trivializing rape with phrases such as “that exam raped me” subtly changes our understanding of sexual assault so that we think of it in a lighthearted way, and strips the word “rape” of much of its meaning until it does not reflect the enormity of the violence that so many experience. This trivialization, in turn, contributes to a culture that does not acknowledge the presence of rape in our communities—leading us to question the veracity of victims’ experiences.
Furthermore, saying things that express public or male control of people’s bodies, especially women’s, shifts the way that we understand bodily agency. People subtly reinforce the idea that women’s bodies exist to be commented upon and dominated through everyday speech. For example, they might tell a woman that she should be grateful when a stranger on the street comments on her body, criticize women for wearing either not enough clothing or too much clothing, or suggest to men that the only important outcome of an interaction with a woman is whether they sleep with her. Statements and suggestions like these cause women to feel less autonomy over their bodies, and pressure men to speak about women in a way that implies domination and conquest on their parts. This distortion of our public understanding of who has control over bodies, and to what level they hold that control, is another important way in which rape culture is reinforced.
We all perpetuate rape culture when we fail to speak up against victim-blaming and slut-shaming comments. However, the fact that we all reinforce this culture means that we also can all take part in dismantling it.
Next Tuesday, there will be a rape culture speak-out, a gathering of people dedicated to creating a safe space in which they can share their experience with rape culture and listen to the voices of others. Our hope is that the speak-out will provide an opportunity not only to validate our experiences but also to demonstrate the solidarity and support that we feel for each other. The speak-out will allow us to recognize that our experiences with rape culture are not isolated incidents, but rather a collective struggle. We hope that through hearing these personal narratives of pain, struggle, and resistance that are so often silenced, students at Harvard will begin to rethink some of their behaviors, and that we can all move toward a common discourse and set of behaviors that are conscious, thoughtful, and productive in dismantling rape culture.

The Harvard-Allston Task Force criticized Harvard’s North Allston development plans in a letter sent to the Boston Redevelopment Authority last week and later obtained by The Crimson.
The letter was sent on the last day of a 30-day public comment period mandated by the BRA after Harvard filed a draft of its Institutional Master Plan for Allston Development on Oct. 18.
In the letter, the Task Force characterized Harvard’s plans as ambiguous and criticized what the Task Force described as a lack of promised community benefits. In addition, the letter raised concerns about the construction and relocation of buildings including the new basketball venue and the Health and Life Science Center.
“All these are issues that need to be taken seriously by the BRA and Harvard,” said Task Force Chair Ray V. Mellone. “I don’t know what the answers are. I just know what the questions are.”
The BRA, which reviews plans for real estate development, will consider the Task Force’s letter alongside others before asking Harvard to revise its IMP draft.
BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler, said that the BRA will outline its demands for changes and clarifications to the Harvard plan in early December. While the BRA will make all of the letters public, the Authority alone will determine how Harvard will be required to modify its plan. According to Autler, it is unlikely that the BRA will ask for more than clarifications.
“I wouldn’t expect that we are going to say in our determination to Harvard that, ‘You need to change this,’” Autler said. “We’ve had a lot of opportunities to give Harvard feedback already.”
Harvard halted its original 2007 Allston development plan in 2009 because of the recession, a move which enraged many Allston residents.
In 2011, the University announced that it was resuming its development in Allston, and Harvard filed a new draft of its Institutional Master Plan Notification Form—the draft of its Master Plan for Allston development—on Oct. 18 of this year.
The Task Force letter also complains that Harvard has not yet fulfilled its original commitments to the Allston community with its new plan.
Autler explained that the University signed a cooperation agreement before the recession and has followed through on some—but not all—of its promises. He said that a new agreement would need to be drafted to fulfill benefits consistent with the new master plan, he said.
“We’re very conscious of the fact that there’s a set of benefits that was negotiated, and I think Harvard is fully committed to delivering those or their equivalents,” Autler said.
Brent C. Whelan ’73, an Allston resident and member of the Task Force, said Harvard already should have fulfilled the commitments that it made in the original cooperation agreement.
“Harvard has not taken any steps to fulfill that promise, even though the cooperation agreement said they would move forward with it before filing the master plan,” Whelan said. “Their approach to that promise to engage in community planning has been to ignore it.”
Whelan said that he expected the BRA to represent the Task Force’s concerns to Harvard, but worried that the University would not feel compelled to ameliorate them.
“They don’t feel like they’re obligated to anyone to do anything,” Whelan said of Harvard. “It would really depend on the goodwill of Harvard rather than any coercive mechanisms. I think Harvard puts its head down and does exactly what its internal constituents want to do.”
In an emailed statement, Associate Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey wrote that Harvard’s IMPNF promises a “robust discussion” of community benefits.

As compers for the Harvard International Review during the fall of 2008, Alex W. Palmer ’12 and Aditya Balasubramanian ’12-’13 demonstrated a common passion for global relations. Four years later, the two share another commonality: they are two of the 34 nationwide recipients of the 2013 Marshall Scholarship.
As Marshall Scholars, both will travel to universities in the United Kingdom next fall, where they will pursue fully-funded graduate study.
A history concentrator with a secondary field in economics, Balasubramanian—a former Crimson business editor—hopes to study econometrics and mathematical economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
Palmer is interested in pursuing a year-long masters program at King’s College London studying Conflict, Security and Development—a program that focuses on the relationship between poverty and security. He is also interested in attending the University of St Andrews in Scotland, but is still open to other options.
Both candidates have extensive experiences abroad which are tied to some of the options they are considering.
After his junior year, Balasubramanian took a year off from school to work at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab in India, where he investigated voter and politician information campaigns.
“I am most interested in the rising inequality in the United States and India, since they are both countries I have ties to,” he said.
Palmer’s experience abroad spanned three different summers, during which he volunteered in refugee camps in Venezuela, Kenya, and the West Bank. Those experiences influenced what Palmer is considering studying.
“In the modern world, when there is a threat, we can’t just think about security, but also whether kids can still go to school and whether people have running water,” he said. “We need to take a more holistic approach.”
After World War II, under the Marshall Plan, the United States provided funding to European countries to help them recover from the war and combat Soviet communism. In 1953, the British government founded the Marshall Scholars Program to commemorate this assistance.
According to the Marshall Scholarship website, “Marshall Scholars strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American peoples, their governments and their institutions” and are “talented, independent and wide-ranging.” Additionally, the program is intended to “enable intellectually distinguished young Americans, their country’s future leaders, to study in the UK.”
Both Balasubramanian and Palmer say that the application process provided a welcome opportunity to identify their passions and to self-reflect.
“Regardless of the outcome, it is a process in which you learn a lot about yourself and get to play back what you’ve done and think about your time here,” Balasubramanian said. “It makes you feel fortunate about all the opportunities you get here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Noah S. Gray-Cabey ’16 makes an impression on anyone who meets him. From across Harvard Yard, any observer would notice his freshly-sculpted Mohawk and wrestler’s physique—wide shoulders and thick arms fill out his signature charcoal pea coat. But for those who get to know him, it is Gray-Cabey’s easygoing nature, admirable sense of modesty, and innate impulsiveness that resonate beyond the first impression.
It is partly this sense of spontaneity that has led Gray-Cabey to acquire a list of interests and accomplishments beyond that of the typical Harvard freshmen.
At age five, he became the youngest pianist ever to play an accompanied solo at the Sydney Opera House. In addition, he performed on “The Oprah Winfrey Show” as a child and starred in two hit television series— “My Wife and Kids” and “Heroes.” And at age 15, he opened his Harvard acceptance letter.
Yet instead of sharing his resume of accomplishments, Gray-Cabey prefers to talk about other interests, like his wrestling training at a mixed martial arts gym in Central Square. He also might mention a nutrition tip that he picked up in his freshman seminar or rattle off film trivia.
For Gray-Cabey, all of his abilities—from his acting to his knowledge of nutrition—play into his goal of being “the ultimate Renaissance man.”
“If you are successful at everything then you can’t be held down,” he says. “That’s an idea that I try to live by, being well rounded with acting, music, athletics, and academics.”
As with any accomplished person with diverse interests, persistent hard work has been crucial to Gray-Cabey’s success. But the former child star’s laundry list of accomplishments also has been encouraged by another trait—a penchant for impulsive decision making.
Embodying these characteristics, Gray-Cabey has succeeded everywhere from the concert hall to the gym.
“HEROIC” BEGINNINGS
Gray-Cabey set off on the path to becoming a Renaissance man before he could articulate this ambition.
After listening to his father play, a four-year-old Gray-Cabey insisted on studying the piano, attempting to emulate what he had heard.
“[My parents] didn’t push me into anything,” Gray-Cabey reflects. “In fact, when I asked him how to play piano, he told me no, that I was too young.”
This initial resistance from his parents did not stop him. Gray-Cabey badgered his father, Shawn Cabey, and the elder Cabey eventually submitted to his son’s requests. These lessons with his father led Gray-Cabey to become one of the most successful child pianists in the world.
From age four to six, Gray-Cabey’s burgeoning talent took him around the world—from an accompanied solo at the Sydney Opera House to a non-profit concert at an orphanage in Jamaica. During this period he appeared on “Jay Leno,” “Good Morning America,” and “The Oprah Winfrey Show.”
Despite his success as a pianist, Gray-Cabey did not hesitate to leave concert halls for production sets.
When a producer for the family sitcom “My Wife and Kids” contacted Gray-Cabey about appearing as a musical guest, the six year old immediately told his parents that he wanted to accept.
Reflecting on the new opportunity, Gray-Cabey said that although he had never considered becoming an actor, he was enthusiastic about pursuing new opportunities even at that age.
Gray-Cabey’s first role on the show was small, just a few sentences of dialogue and a few notes on the piano.
“Then they kept giving me more lines and extra stuff to say, and it just kind of snowballed from there,” he says.
That snowball eventually avalanched into an acting career rivaling his musical one. Gray-Cabey and his family moved from Newry, Maine to California, where he became a permanent member of the cast. His television acting continued after the end of “My Wife and Kids” with guest appearances on shows ranging from “Grey’s Anatomy” to “CSI Miami.”
In 2006, he joined the cast of “Heroes” as Micah Sanders, a young boy who could communicate with and control technology.
Comparing “Heroes” to his previous work, Gray-Cabey described the job as far more intense.
The pinnacle of that intensity came during a long night filming his final scene of the show. After being fired at with blanks during hours of filming, Gray-Cabey contracted pneumonia.
But not even severe sickness could dampen his spirits.
“That night was pretty awesome,” he says.
FROM HOLLYWOOD TO HARVARD
Staying true to his ambition of becoming a Renaissance man, Gray-Cabey balanced his acting career with his pursuit of academic achievement. At age 11 he started high school after six years of homeschooling.
Despite his hectic filming schedule, which forced him to miss countless days of school, Gray-Cabey managed to maintain an academic record that eventually would earn him a spot at Harvard.
“I just had to do a lot of juggling of schoolwork and acting, which is tough,” said Gray-Cabey, who missed more than 60 days of class his sophomore year.
At age 15, he graduated from high school and was admitted to Harvard.
“I just always wanted to go to Harvard,” Gray-Cabey says. “I feel like there are a lot of people here who aren’t just pure academics, a lot of people who just have a lot of different interests.”
A fitness-lover, Gray-Cabey participated in First-Year Outdoor Program as a member of the class of 2015.
Inspired by gap year stories told by his fellow participants, Gray-Cabey decided to take a year off just a few days before the beginning of the term. Like most of his impulsive choices, the change in plans suited Gray-Cabey, who calls it “the best decision I ever made.”
During that time, he acted in an independent movie called “The Volunteer.” In the yet to be released film, Gray-Cabey plays the nephew of a woman who quits her job to volunteer at a soup kitchen.
When his gap year finished at the end of the summer, Gray-Cabey finally made the move to Cambridge.
THE RENAISSANCE CONTINUES
Despite his success as an artist and performer, Gray-Cabey rarely discusses his past accomplishments at Harvard.
“He said to us, if we hadn’t found out, he wouldn’t have told us,” said James R. M. Watkins ’16, one of his suitemates.
Although he goes to great lengths to avoid attention—he refuses to play the piano in front of his roommates—other students do sometimes recognize him from his days as a child star.
“It’s kind of hilarious,” Gray-Cabey says of people identifying him. “I think my roommates get a kick out of it more than I do.
”The curly haired child who once appeared on television screens across America now sports a pierced ear and a Mohawk, both of which were fashioned in the suite across from his own. Someone suggested transforming his appearance, and he immediately agreed to the makeover, his roommates said.
This impulsive nature carries over into his day-to-day life.
“He’ll hear something and take it as gospel truth,” Michael S. Loughlin ’16 said of his suitemate’s willingness to follow nutrition tips from his freshman seminar.
After learning of the health benefits of olive oil, Gray-Cabey proceeded to slather it over everything he ate, adding the new diet to his already intense exercise regimen.
This new health-conscious lifestyle is another instance of his continued pursuit to become the ultimate Renaissance man.
Just as his decisions at Harvard reflect his history of embracing new opportunities to better himself, Gray-Cabey’s open-mindedness shows no sign of disappearing anytime soon.
Although he has taken a break from pursuing acting or music on campus so far, he hopes to take the stage again at some point.
“I’ll to continue to run with [acting] while I can and keep with it as long as it’s enjoyable,” Gray-Cabey said. “If something else presents itself, I’ll take it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from the Administrative Board, University Health Services, and other campus groups sought to clarify the University’s current policies in dealing with cases of rape or sexual assault at a panel on Wednesday evening.
The panel was organized as a response to the highly-publicized cases of sexual assault at Amherst College. The topic of sexual assault has gained particular salience on campus following a recently passed referendum for Harvard to re-examine its sexual assault policies.
“We want to promote a better understanding of how Harvard handles this issue,” said John N. Azubuike Jr. ’14, vice president of the student group Consent, Assault Awareness, and Relationship Educators. “We need to fill in gaps of information before we have a more evolved dialogue.”
Panelists represented organizations directly involved with sexual assault response on campus, including the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Harvard University Police Department, and the Ad Board.
“Our goal is to make sure that someone doesn’t lose the opportunity to get a degree at Harvard because of something that has happened to them,” said OSAPR Director Sarah Rankin. “Zero percent of these cases are inevitable. They can be prevented.”
Patrick D. O’Callahan, an associate physician at UHS, and Marianne E. Cook ’02, a social worker at Student Mental Health Services, emphasized that students who have experienced sexual assault can avail of their services under complete confidentiality.
“We are here to help people to deal with the emotional and psychological impact of sexual assault and trauma,” Cook said. “Your records are yours and yours alone.”
At the event, Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison clarified the process by which students can bring their cases to the University.
“We want students to succeed. We want students not just to graduate, but to enjoy their experience here and to thrive,” Ellison said.
The process includes two written statements from each party, committee interviews, and research by an independent fact-finder.
The Ad Board meets with each student to determine whether there is enough evidence to validate the accusation and whether the incident violates Harvard rules, Ellison said.
Ellison added that the Ad Board’s ultimate responsibility is to the community.
“At the end of the day, it really is about integrity, how we treat each other, and how we live together,” he said.

Thomas E. Donilon, national security advisor to President Barack Obama, disputed the idea that American supremacy is on the decline during a conversation at the Institute of Politics Wednesday evening.
Donilon cited military strength, national values, and geographic qualities as advantages that America retains in its relations with other countries. Furthermore, he said that, within the international community, there is “incredible demand” for American leadership.
The conversation was facilitated by Graham T. Allison ’62, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and began with advice for students interested in politics and policy.
“Even if your initial steps here are in the private sector, keep your hand in it and look for opportunities to get more involved,” Donilon said.
He also emphasized the importance of history and its role in providing an understanding of how others have dealt with various issues.
During the discussion, Allison brought up accusations that the Obama administration is “good at improvisation, not strategy.”
In response, Donilon laid out part of the administration’s strategy, including economic restoration, relationships with other nations, and an examination of the American footprint in the world.
He stressed that the Obama administration has continued to build alliances across the world.
“No other nation around the world has the system of alliances America does,” he said, adding that it was “brought about by over 5 decades of bipartisan support.”
Donilon added that by analyzing where America is over-invested—such as war zones—and under-invested—such as Asia—the Obama administration can redirect national security policy.
The discussion also covered the Administration’s attempts promote the reduction of nuclear weapons.
In particular, Donilon pointed to the “tremendous pressure” they are exerting on Iran through sanctions.
When asked to comment on the strengths of all the presidents he’s worked with, Donilon said the reason he has his job is precisely because he does not answer such questions.
After the discussion with Allison, Sietse K. Goffard ’15 asked Donilon what keeps him up at night.
“Everything,” Donilon said. “But it’s a very exciting job.”

A panel at the Harvard Law School Wednesday discussed the ethical debate over the use of embryonic stem cells in the United States, focusing on the burgeoning controversy surrounding the role of stem cell therapy in medical tourism.
Medical tourism, in which patients travel internationally to gain access to specific health care services, has become increasingly common, panelists said. They said that reasons for medical tourism range from basic hip replacement surgery to black market organ sales. As most stem cell therapies are not approved in the United States, numerous patients are going abroad to countries like China and Russia where treatment is legal.
Panelist I. Glenn Cohen, an assistant professor at the Law School, said that it was probable that a Chinese stem cell facility performs several hundred thousand of these treatments yearly. He said that numerous celebrities, including football quarterback Peyton Manning, have reportedly traveled abroad to receive stem cell treatment not approved by the FDA.
A number of facilities claim to use stem cells to cure a wide array of diseases. University of Alberta law professor Timothy Caulfield, another panelist, pointed out that a simple Google search leads potential patients to a plethora of websites which claim that diseases such as autism and cancer can be cured through stem cell therapy.
“It’s being offered as routine, it’s being offered as safe, it’s being offered as effective,” Caulfield said, citing his own 2008 study on the subject, “Of course, none of them being offered matched what the scientific literature said.”
According to American history professor Jill Lepore, the “hyper-acceleration of enthusiasm” for stem cell therapy is reminiscent of a century ago when science journalism and government funding for science research began to blossom. Lepore pointed out how public excitement over scientific procedures has affected society in the past, popularizing cryonics research and the work of Eugene Steinach, who claimed his vasectomy operation reversed the aging process.
Panelists said that one issue with stem cell tourism is the number of health risks associated with such procedures, citing a number of instances where stem cell therapy caused serious harm.
They also noted that public discussion about stem cell therapy has been markedly positive, lending an air of legitimacy to stem cell therapy that hasn’t been validated by research.
Articles criticizing stem cell tourism, on the other hand, have generally received a less favorable response. Caulfield told the audience that when he co-wrote an article in The Atlantic criticizing stem cell therapy, he was accused as being a  “nutball Canadian socialist bioethicist.”
The panelists emphasized that more accurate information should be provided to the public regarding stem cell treatments.

Brevia, a new undergraduate research journal focusing on shorter-form articles, is set to publish its first issue next semester. The journal gives students the opportunity to showcase their new research in fields that range from hard sciences to the humanities in under 500 words.
“[We recognize] that people speak in the more biological and physical sciences sense when it comes to research, but we really want to expand that to other fields,” said Brevia co-chair Jennifer S. Chen ’15. “I think Brevia is pushing that idea.”
Chen, Ryan Lee ’15, and Josephine Volovetz ’14, all members of Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association’s Campus Projects Committee, serve as the co-chairs of Brevia.
In addition to covering a broad range of topics, the new journal aims to make research more accessible. Submissions must meet a 500-word limit to allow easy readability, according to those spearheading the effort.
“We really emphasize the short, to-the-point research,” Lee said. “Science Magazine also has a section called ‘Brevia,’ and it’s pretty much the same concept.... [The articles] will aim towards people who are not in the field. We don’t really want technical terms. We’re not looking for your typical research paper.”
In addition to short research summaries, the journal will also feature a “Brevia Spotlight” section that will allow undergraduates to interview peers involved in research and to submit highlights of those interviews to the journal.
“The ultimate goal is making awesome research more accessible,” Chen said. “The aim of the HCURA isn’t just to promote research on campus, but also to form a community of researchers, and we do that by learning what our peers are doing and by taking pride in all the research we’re doing here.”
Submissions for Brevia’s first issue are due by Dec. 7. The co-chairs said they hope to publish one issue per semester, but that the frequency will depend on the number of submissions they receive.
“I think just as much as [Brevia] is making the articles and what is published accessible to the campus community, it is also making a forum that isn’t too intimidating to submit to,” Chen said.
HCURA already has a presence on Harvard’s campus; the organization hosts a research conference and coordinates an advising program.
“One of the last frontiers that we didn’t have anything for was publications and showing the rest of the community what students are doing. I guess we wanted to dip into that,” Volovetz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started last October with a meal in Currier dining hall with a handful of friends who shared something in common: an affinity for kinky sex.
More than a year after the group first began informally meeting over meals to discuss issues and topics relating to kinky sex, Harvard College Munch has grown from seven to about 30 members and is one of 15 student organization that will be approved by the Committee on Student Life this Friday.
Michael, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect his privacy, is the founder of Munch, an informal lunch or dinner meeting for people across the kink community.
For him, the recognition will provide a sense of ease for current and future members, knowing they are receiving institutional support.
“It’s a little hyperbolic for me to get teary-eyed and paternal about sophomores, but it’s really a joy to see the experience they will have now,” Michael said.
Michael said there are many benefits to being officially recognized on campus such as being able to poster for events and promote Munch’s presence.
“If you come to campus and you have the sexual interests we represent, you may not even suspect that such a group exists,” Michael said.
Munch is also now allowed to apply for DAPA food grants, making it easier to find a convenient time and location to meet, instead of gathering in small dining halls.
But for Michael, the biggest advantage to being recognized comes with “the fact of legitimacy,” he said. “[Our recognition] shows we are being taken seriously.”
Mae, a member of the organization who asked to be identified by her middle name, said since its formation the group has provided her with a comfortable space to discuss her interests.
“I didn’t think that anyone was even remotely interested [in kink] on campus,” Mae said. “It’s a community where you can feel safe, and you can feel comfortable talking about [kink].”
Even though Boston and Cambridge are both hosts to some munch groups, Michael said he thought bringing a munch group to campus would provide a more comfortable space for students to discuss their sexual desires.
“Pretty much everyone who joins this club always thought they were alone,” Michael said.
Munch attempted to gain official recognition last semester, but troubles finding a stable adviser and problems with their constitution left them waiting another semester.
Mae said the experience, however, was worthwhile because it inspired the organization to create a safety team—a group of people who can direct students who have faced abuse or trauma to appropriate resources on campus.
Mae said that kinky students may feel uncomfortable discussing their sexual practices, after experiencing any form of abuse or trauma, with certain people for fear of being misunderstood or judged. She said the resources ensure students receive the help they need from people who are educated about the kink community.
Other approved organizations, who will gain official recognition after completing a workshop on Friday, include the Harvard College Comics Club, the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association, and the Harvard Undergraduate Maternal Health Initiative.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 29
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the kinky sex discussion group Harvard College Munch has 20 members. In fact, it has about 30 active members. The article also stated that the group unsuccessfully applied for recognition from the College last month, while in fact it first sought official approval last semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Applications for early admission to Harvard College’s class of 2017 numbered 4,856, marking a nearly 15 percent surge from last year’s figure, the University announced on Thursday.
This year’s early admissions cycle—only the second since the University reinstated early action in 2011—fell during a particularly inopportune time for many applicants. The November 1 deadline was just days after Hurricane Sandy pummeled the East Coast, damaging homes, closing schools, and leaving many without electricity.
The storm delayed the administration of standardized tests, and left teachers and students without power unable to submit materials online. The admissions office was lenient in accepting late material as a result, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said.
The College’s early admissions process allows students who apply by November 1 to receive a non-binding decision in mid-December. Under the program, known as single choice early action, students may not apply early to another college.
Fitzsimmons said that the rise in early applicants did not come as a surprise to the admissions office, as more students and college counselors have become aware of the renewal of the early action program and the College’s generous financial aid package.
The University’s major impetus for eliminating early action in 2007 was the notion that the program benefited students from privileged socioeconomic backgrounds.
According to Fitzsimmons, who recently returned from a recruiting trip with Princeton and the University of Virginia, financial aid is more important to families of college applicants than ever. “The anxiety about the economy is palpable when you’re out in the public,” he said.
A “Net-Price Calculator” on the Admissions and Financial Aid website allows families of any applicant to predict the approximate amount of aid they would receive from Harvard if the student is admitted.
There was a 39 percent increase in those requesting fee waivers among this year’s early applicants.
This year’s early applicant pool also saw increases in applications from certain minority groups, including a 22 percent increase in African American applicants and a 24 percent increase in Native American applicants.
Fitzsimmons said the increased awareness about Harvard’s financial aid program may have contributed to these shifting demographics.
“It is true that in minority communities generally there are large proportions of families that will be applying for financial aid,” Fitzsimmons said.
Other Ivy League institutions also saw increases in early applications this year. Yale received a total of 4,514 early applications, a 4.4 percent increase from the previous year, and Princeton received 3,791, a 10 percent increase. The University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, and Brown received 4,780, 3,126, and 2,957 early applications this year, up 5.6 percent, 1.3 percent, and 1 percent respectively from last year. Dartmouth, on the other hand, saw a 12.5 percent decrease in early applicants.
Fitzsimmons said that there has been a shift in how secondary school counselors approach early admissions programs since Princeton and the University of Virginia renewed their early action programs alongside Harvard in 2011. With all top-tier schools offering some form of early admissions, high-schoolers no longer have to hold off on the application process to get into their top choice university.
“The new normal is that there is a chunk of people who would apply early and then another chunk who would apply regular,” he said. “In a sense, one might argue that early is no longer early.”
But Fitzsimmons added that his office is aware that not all students are well suited to apply early, and the the admissions office will be prudent in extending admissions offers to students given the limited number of beds for the freshman class.
“One size does not fit all,” Fitzsimmons said.
Last year, the admissions office sent acceptance letters to 18 percent of the 4,228 early action applicants. These students were the first group of early applicants to be admitted after the College discontinued the early action program for a four-year period.
Last year, the overall acceptance rate fell to a record low 5.9 percent, with the rate for those considered under regular decision, including early applicants deferred to regular decision, sitting at a miniscule 3.8 percent.
Fitzsimmons said the admissions office ultimately admitted about 100 students who had been deferred from early admission last year, either during the regular decision round or from the waitlist.
The admissions office will notify students of their early admissions decisions this year by Dec. 13.

Harvard alums around the world saw action this week, impressing abroad but struggling here at home.
With another loss under their belts, the Bills aren’t ready to give up on Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 (yet). In their 20-13 win over Buffalo, the Colts held the Amish Rifle to 17-33 and 180 yards. A one-yard touchdown pass with 11:30 to play gave the Bills their only touchdown of the night. The team has failed to make the playoffs for 12 straight years, and Fitzpatrick’s critics say that its time for a change. However, the Bills maintain that they will continue to wait it out.
On the west coast, Raiders defensive tackle Desmond Bryant ’09 is coming down after two big weeks. After putting up 5 tackles against the Ravens and the Saints—with 5 unassisted against Baltimore—Bryant had only one in this week’s loss to the Bengals.
While Crimson alums struggled on the gridiron this week, they dominated the court. In Canada, guard Oliver McNally ’12 leads the NBL in total assists and assists per game, and he sits in second place for steals, with 21. In 11 games with the Montcon Miracles, McNally is averaging 9.8 points per game, and the team sits atop the Atlantic Division with a 7-4 record.
Overseas, forward Keith Wright ’12 continues to impress (and enjoy his time playing). After signing with Swedish basketball team Uppsala in October, Wright made his home debut two weeks ago, putting up 10 points in 23 minutes of play. This week, Uppsala upset 08 Stockholm behind a strong performance from Wright—16 points and 14 rebounds—, and the team moved into second place. In Uppsala’s previous game, Wright had a season-high 23 points.
The NHL is brining in federal mediators to aid in lockout negotiations after cancelling over a third of regular season games, ensuring that Harvard alums will not see the rink anytime soon. A similar tactic failed to resolve the 2004-05 NHL lockout, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire season.

Coming off a strong showing against Boston College in the MIT Round Robin, the Harvard women’s squash team (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) had no problem taking down conference rival Dartmouth (0-1, 0-1) Wednesday night at the Murr Center.
At No. 8 in the country, the Big Green was the first top-ranked opponent the Crimson faced this season.
“It’s the second match of the season, but the first test,” Coach Mike Way said. “It’s their first test mentally as well as on the court.”
Harvard’s top nine swept their matches in the first meeting against the Ivy foe.
“We were pretty excited today because it was our first Ivy League match,” co-captain Sarah Mumanachit said. “We’ve been training pretty hard since the day we got on campus, so it was exciting to start competition finally. Dartmouth is a pretty strong competitor to start our season off with. It was nice to see everyone putting everything they’d been working on to the test, really bringing it out, and improving on things.”
Mumanachit cruised to a 3-0 victory at the No. 6 spot.  Fellow co-captain Natasha Kingshott followed suit and failed to drop a game in the No. 5 position.
The Crimson was anchored by the strong play of Laura Gemmell.  After playing injured most of last year, the senior opened up her first match of the year in the No. 1 spot against the Big Green’s Corey Schafer.  Schafer earned All-Ivy honors last season on the heels of strong play during her junior year.
“She’s always been a great player,” Gemmell said. “She moves really well. Last year, I was very injured. This is the first year that I’ve actually felt better, and I felt like I was moving well and my body didn’t hurt.”
Gemmell quickly picked up an 11-4 win in her first game, but she got off to a slower start in in the second and found herself down 4-1 to Schafer. The senior, however, rolled off four straight points on her way to an 11-8 victory in the second game and finished her opponent off with an easy 11-3 win to take the match.
“I thought I had control of the match,” Gemmell said. “I was hitting good length, and I was hitting good drops in the front.  She’s a good player, and I thought I played really well.”
Harvard was without two of their regular starters in Wednesday night’s contest. Amanda Sobhy, usually the top player for the Crimson, and fellow sophomore Julianne Chu, who normally competes at No. 7, were both out for the match against the Big Green. The gaps in the lineup allowed younger players to gain valuable experience on the court.
“To get the girls at the bottom to come in and play some matches, even if it’s outside the top nine, to give them that experience [is great],” Way said. “When you’re missing [your starters], everyone is now playing up. At the bottom, people have tougher matches. They’ve got to carry themselves and go on with that maturity and not be fraught with nerves because they’re playing above where they normally might be.”
Gemmell’s younger sister Michelle was one of three freshmen to play in the top nine for Harvard, posting a 3-0 win at the No. 3 spot. Saumya Karki, who played No.1 last week against BC, picked up her win in straight games in the No. 4 spot, while fellow first-year Isabelle Dowling won her match at No. 8.
Allie Sperry, the fourth freshman on the team, picked up a win in the No. 14 court.
“We have a great group of [freshmen] girls,” Mumanachit said, “They are really meshing well with the team. We hope to see some really great things from them.”
Elsewhere on the court, No. 2 player Haley Mendez easily handled her opponent in her season debut, rolling to a 3-0 win. Fellow sophomore Meghan Murray was also a strong force for the Crimson in the No. 7 position, picking up a 3-2 win.  Rounding out the top nine, senior Eliza Calihan posted a victory in the No. 9 spot with a 3-1 victory.
Even without a few core members of its lineup, Harvard seems primed for success this season as it prepares to face more highly-ranked Ivy foes.  The Crimson has posted 9-0 victories in its first two competitive matches this season.
“I think we’re the team to beat,” Gemmell said. “Our team is extremely strong. For this match, we didn’t have our No. 1 and our No.7.  But with them, I think we are the team to beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a defense-dominated first half on Wednesday night, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself with a narrow 25-19 lead over New Hampshire with 20 minutes to play.
Then the Crimson’s shots started falling. Sophomore guard Ali Curtis sank a three-pointer from the top of the key and senior forward Victoria Lippert followed a minute later with a trey of her own, extending Harvard’s lead to 31-19.
The Crimson (5-2) started the second period on a 16-6 run en route to rolling over the Wildcats (3-2), 63-44, at Lavietes Pavilion. Lippert keyed Harvard’s second half run by notching 21 points, including 17 in the second half, on 7-of-10 shooting. The senior was also 3-of-5 from beyond the arc and grabbed seven boards on the night in 23 minutes of playing time. It was her 12th career 20-point game.
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith noted the contrast between the team’s offense in the first and second halves.
“I feel the offense was frenetic [in the first half],” she said. “I thought we were not executing our offense at all, and our timing and connection with each other was not good. The fact that we even had a lead was good…. I thought we executed a little better in the second half—and then [Lippert] got hot.”
At one point, Lippert scored eight straight points for the Crimson, hitting two shots from downtown and a second-chance bucket to extend Harvard’s lead to 16 points with 12:56 to play.
Lippert credited her second-half success to better execution.
“I was just trying to be on balance and take what they were giving me, so I got open behind the 3-point line a few times and was able to hit those,” Lippert said. “They had some smaller girls guarding me, so I was just trying to use what I had. Fortunately, the shots were going in.”
Even though the Crimson pulled away in the final period, it shot just 36 percent for the half and 39 percent for the game.
“Believe it or not, 39 percent is not that bad,” Delaney-Smith said. “Thirty-nine percent is good enough to win ballgames, especially when you’re holding teams to around 44 points.”
As defense was a critical focus coming into the game, limiting New Hampshire’s points was essential, according to Lippert.
“We feel good about the defense,” Lippert said. “We really wanted to pick it up on the defensive end and string together stops for 40 minutes. That was our intention tonight, and I think we were able to do that.”
Harvard held the Wildcats to just 34 percent on 17-of-50 shooting, along with collecting seven steals and five blocks. Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle led the Crimson with three steals, and co-captain Miriam Rutzen added three blocks.
Harvard also dominated the glass, outrebounding New Hampshire, 43-27, including 18 offensive boards. It was the first time this season that the Wildcats had been outrebounded.
No play better demonstrated the Crimson’s prowess on the boards than a sequence in which, following a steal by senior guard Elle Hagedorn, Harvard grabbed three straight offensive rebounds. On the last, Clark drew a foul and made both free throws to extend the lead to 56-37 with five minutes to play. Clark, who leads the team in points per game, contributed 13 points on 4-of-15 shooting and led the team with eight rebounds.
In the first half, the Crimson fell behind, 4-0, after two buckets by New Hampshire forward Morgan Frame but ran off seven straight points to gain the advantage.
Harvard extended its lead to 23-14 after Clark sank a 17-footer from the top of the key, but Wildcat guard Ariel Gaston quickly responded with a three. Senior guard Cari Reed, who led New Hampshire with 10 points for the game, added a layup 30 seconds later to lessen the gap heading into the break.
The second half, though, belonged to the Crimson, as it controlled both ends of the floor.
The blowout win gave Harvard its first 5-2 start since the 2004-05 season, but the team knows it must build on its second-half performance against the Wildcats and execute defensively. The offense is less of a concern, according to Delaney-Smith.
“I never feel that offense will be our issue,” she said. “I believe that, on any given night, someone is going to get hot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The only game the Harvard men’s squash dropped to Dartmouth in its home opener at the Murr Center on Wednesday night was one that hit close to home for co-captain Jason Michas.
In an otherwise commanding performance, the No. 3 Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) swept every other match to win, 9-0, against the No. 8 Big Green (0-1, 0-1) in its first Ivy match of the season.
“It was our first Ivy League match; it was our first real match of the season,” Michas said. “We played some scrimmages, but this is a team that my freshman year we lost to in the scrimmage…. I personally wasn’t playing my best squash, but I was proud that everybody found a way to win.”
Michas, the No. 8 seed, played his former high school teammate James Fisch in the first round of matches. The Harvard senior jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead, taking the first two games in a decisive fashion.
Fisch bounced back and stole the third game, and Michas struggled in the beginning of the fourth, falling to a 4-1 deficit early in the game. But the co-captain quickly rebounded, showing off his backhand and a handful of well-placed shots that put him in the lead, 8-7.
The two began a rough battle over the next few points, never letting the margin of difference extend past two, with the crowd enthusiastically applauding every point scored by the Ivy foes.
Michas refused to relinquish his lead throughout the tough play and eventually clinched the fourth game, 12-10, to win his match.
But for Michas, the win was unique because of his relationship to his opponent.
“It was actually a special match because the guy I was playing was from my high school, and I kind of got him into squash,” Michas said. “A long time ago, when I was a senior in high school, he was a freshman. It was great to see a kid who I helped get into the sport, and he’s improved so much since then on his own time.”
The rest of the match was all Crimson, as the rest of its top nine swept the Big Green in straight games. Harvard was led by its No. 1 seeded player, junior Ali Farag, who continued his impressive campaign from last year. In the 2011-12 season, Farag went undefeated, winning all 16 of his matches and receiving first team All-Ivy League honors.
“It’s a lot of pressure on me, actually, because everyone is expecting you to win,” Farag said. “Last year, I had nothing to lose, but this year, I have a lot on my shoulders. It’s both confidence and pressure [to win].”
Although Crimson coach Mike Way focused on other players who “needed” the coaches, he had no doubts that his best player would perform well against the first-seeded player from Dartmouth.
“I know that [Farag] probably put on his Cirque du Soleil performance, which he loves to do,” Way said. “He’s got a wand in his hand and the most beautiful hand, so without even watching, I can visualize exactly what he did.”
The Big Green’s top player, Chris Hanson, hung with Farag for a while, keeping the scores close, but the junior soon shook off his rust in his first match of the year to surpass Hanson in three games. But despite the win he wasn’t pleased with his play early on.
“It was the first game of the season, so it’s never easy,” Farag said. “I started [preparation] a little late, so I wasn’t really prepared for it since it was my first match since maybe March of last year. But then I picked up the pace, and I think I played well at the end.”
The newest members of Harvard squash, freshmen Matt Roberts and Sam Goldberg, also posted solid performances in their first Ivy match, each beating their respective Big Green opponents to win their first league matches.
Roberts, the No. 9 seed for the Crimson, played a nail-biter of a game, trailing his opponent, Mark Funk, 9-4, in the third. A 6-1 run by Roberts knotted the score at ten, and he made quick work of his Ivy competitor after that, taking the final game, 12-10.
“I think that the freshmen, Mattie Roberts and Sam Goldberg, came in and it was their first real test,” Way said. “Again, it’s such a test mentally, so we were very pleased with how both players performed. They both won, and it’s just going to set them up and the team up for when we go into the nuts and bolts of the season in January.”
Although the numbers showed a dominant victory for Harvard, Farag notes that the statistics don’t tell the entire story.
“To be honest, they’re good—better than I expected,” Farag said. “They’re playing well. Last year, it was easier, but now that I think that they’re playing well, I’m happy that we won all of our matches.”

Harvard operates in acronyms, and sometimes it feels like our sentences are mostly just letters: "HUDS is going to send me to UHS" or "My PAF is my TF in my SLS class!" It's like our own secret language, and also helpful when we're too lazy to actually say Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding. However, people who aren't familiar with the jargon could get confused. Here are some alternatives to our beloved and well known letters, from the real world.
HUD(s): Heads-Up Display
This might be familiar to those gamers out there. Turns out it refers to the way that video games display the characters to the players: from above their heads. Like when you're playing Mario Karts and you can see the back of Yoshi/Bowser/Toad's head. That.
IOP: Inanimate Objects Party
You may think this is a party theme where attendants dress up like lamps and carpets, but apparently it's a political party from Rennsaelear Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York. Some candidates that have run are an inflatable whale named Arthur Galpin and an albino squirrel. We'd totally vote for them.
OEB: Olde English Bulldogge
At Harvard, these letters typically stand for Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, but sometimes it also means Olde English Bulldogge (the e's are necessary). Does this slobbery dog with a smushed face and major underbite have any similarities to OEB concentrators?
VES: Voluntary Euthanasia Society
Our visual and environmental studies concentration also shares an acronym with the Voluntary Euthanasia Society—maybe a concentrator could make a film noir reflection on this similarity?
TF: Totally F**ked
Teaching fellow is such a pretentious way to describe the job every other school in the country calls a TA. Why fellow? Why does Harvard love that word? Peer Advising Fellow, Teaching Fellow…what's so wrong with peer advisor? Or teaching assistant? In any case, it seems strangely appropiate that another meaning of those two infamous letters was all the rage in the early 1970s, when TF was a sly way of saying "totally f**ked." We recommend trying both in one sentence! "Thanks to my unhelpful TF, I'm TF for my final."

With power still out and students getting hungry, Harvard University Dining Services is offering partial meals and directing students to Quad dining halls, a HUDS chef said Thursday afternoon.
According to a Harvard Alert, Annenberg, Mather House, and Dunster House dining halls are also serving food.
Others, like Adams, Leverett, Lowell, and Kirkland, are serving pre-cooked and cold foods.
Adams House chef Arlene Richburg said HUDS officials held a conference call around 5 p.m., shortly after the beginning of dining hall dinner hours, to develop a plan of action.
Quad Houses, who still have power, have opened their dining halls to students living in the Yard or in river Houses.
"We're just moving food around to make sure everybody gets a meal," Richburg said.
Cambridge police tweeted around 5 p.m. that it would take several hours to restore power.
