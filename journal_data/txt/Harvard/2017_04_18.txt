After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The crisis: ants. The injunction: this is how you get them. This was the type of humor that formed the bedrock of FX’s “Archer” for four solid seasons. It was a comedy of inside jokes that became funny over time through repetition, like the recurring exclamation “that’s how you get ants!” and Archer’s constant references to the Kenny Loggins song and pop culture artifact “Danger Zone” (a tune hummed continuously while writing this article). They might not have been funny the first or second time, but damn it they were funny the 5th, 10th, and 42nd iterations.  However, after four great seasons, it seemed like the showrunners felt the idiosyncratic set of jokes and character quirks had become, frankly, repetitive. Someone decided it was time for a change.
To beat this extreme form of sitcom malaise the show went through a series of reboots including the fifth season’s bloated “Archer Vice” (where the international spy agency turns to international drug smuggling), a return to form and espionage in season six, the well received “Magnum P.I.” L.A. detective parody of season seven, and finally season eight: “Archer Dreamland.”
Picking up with the season seven cliffhanger, the season eight premiere finds ex-spy, ex-drug trafficker, and potentially ex-detective Sterling Archer in a coma. His mind serves as the stage for this latest reboot—a parody of 1940’s noir film. The only catch is, at least for this episode, the parody was noticeably absent, leaving viewers with a strange alternate world or fan video where a mediocre noir film finds all its characters replaced with those of an animated FX show.
While there are still jokes, they are fewer and farther between than in previous seasons.  Part of this is definitely a consequence of the explication needed to ‘recast’ all the old characters in their new reboot roles. Hopefully, as the season goes on, the show will be able to return more to the comedy, because I definitely don’t watch “Archer” for the drama. That’s not to say the show is without pathos as there have been some uniquely despairing moments in past seasons (particularly in the later ‘Barry’s revenge’ story arcs), but normal plot and dialogue have never been the staples of the show.  This episode sees Archer grapple with some shell-shocked WWII flashbacks and engage in slow dialogue that’s a far cry from repartee. It’s a change of pace for the series, but in comparison to previous seasons “Dreamland” just feels out of place.
However, to give the devil’s advocate his due, the archetypal ellipses and amnesias of the noir genre may actually prove an interesting device for the hopeless reasoning of Archer’s comatose mind as he hunts for the killer of his trusty manservant (and heroin addict) Woodhouse. If there is additional redemption to be found in the noir format, it’s in the fact that the plots of post-war Hollywood noir were never really ‘good’ to begin with. They generally gravitated towards the stylings of pulp and mystery, which for a show that’s seen Archer’s team of spies and their bureaucratic colleagues go to space and battle with pirates (not at the same time) may prove an appropriate turn.
For what it’s worth, the premiere does succeed in reconceiving of several noir tropes to humorous results—not to spoil the punchline but the “Archer” excuse for the classic gumshoe voiceover is particularly good. It will take a while yet for the characters in this world to build the same rapport they had in previous incarnations of the “Archer” universe (if they do at all), but going into this season with meager expectations might not be the worst policy. Hopefully, it can only get better.

The end of "New Girl"'s sixth season struggles to engage the viewer. The episode rehashes old problems for Nick (Jake Johnson) and Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and pushes significant events into the background. As the end of the season, these events hint towards changes in the lives of the secondary characters. But if the show continues, Cece’s pregnancy and the introduction of Winston’s father read more as a desperate attempt to find something new for the show rather than acting as a sweet and complete ending.
Cece (Hannah Simone) having a child and Winston (Lamorne Morris) calling his father are thrown in like insignificant events, though they really aren’t. While celebrated in passing, these events take a backseat to the peripheral romantic relationships. Winston does not seem as agonized over finding his father’s phone number as he seems infatuated with his fiancée? for finding the information. This does not seem realistic.
The misplaced emphasis is just another casualty of the exaggerated importance of Nick and Jess’s relationship, which doesn’t hold up to the excitement built around it. In the end, the final struggle for Nick and Jess to finally be together requires very little difficulty. They fall together all too easily. Their only obstacle occurs at Nick’s reading, when Nick casually implies that the two should not be together. Nick’s ex-girlfriend disappears from his life and his mind without difficulty or drama. The surrounding characters push Nick and Jess together more seamlessly that can be expected from a romantic comedy. The lack of tension is unexciting and makes their previous separation, so easily resolved, seem unnecessary.
Without tension, their happy ending feels less satisfying, and their path to love feels too predictable. If this is not the series finale, there appears to be little left to do with Nick and Jess that has not already been explored, as proven by the repetitive, almost redundant, dialogue about their relationship in the episode.
If this episode was the finale of the entire show, it wears out Nick and Jess, but leaves the side characters with room to live happy and interesting lives. The end of the episode, in which all of the characters are happily coupled, wraps up the show well in theory, but falls short in its execution.

Identities, Harvard’s annual student-run fashion show, looks to use fashion as a medium for championing diversity on campus. This year’s show, which took place on April 15 at Northwest Science Building, was titled Fashion + Tech. The program’s website promised “a glimpse into the future of fashion.” The garments were still recognizable to the present-day viewer, but the show did incorporate a healthy amount of innovation in the wide range of materials presented. Identities successfully executed its mission with the diversity of both its clothing and models’ backgrounds and poses.
At the beginning of the show, Google Project Jacquard’s Ivan Poupyrev, winner of the Annual Identities Fashion Innovator of the Year award, spoke about the project. Speaking about his idea to mix fashion and technology—the project worked with LEVI’s to create a jacket  with wired sleeves that can play music, make a call, and look up directions—Poupyrev fit in with the show’s theme well. The speech, though impressive, could have been shorter, as the audience eventually seemed to grow a bit restless. To keep the show stimulating, the music varied from loud, upbeat, full-of-bass songs to tense, syncopated music. The reaction from the audience was often synced to the potency of the playlist, and the music did a good job of keeping engagement high.
The clothing shown on student models included a variety of fashions: from activewear to business attire, from floor-length gowns to dresses made up of plastic bags. A garment made to look like a fan (which opened as a fan would) was extremely creative. Additionally, there were garments made of all kinds of materials: lace, velvet, linen, cotton, plastic bags, wood, and computer chips. No material was off the table in the designing process. 
Other features of the show added to its innovation. Fragments of text made frequent appearance on the clothes in the first segment. Phrases on the dresses included “My Planet or Yours” and “Finally Slipped Out of Reality”. Gender-bending was also at play, with a few male models wearing dresses and skirts. Identities mission to “champion diversity” was well-executed in its commitment to exhibiting a range of ethnicities in its models. The models themselves had differing identities in this way.
It was also fun to watch the models showcase their personalities through their poses. Some blew kisses or winked. Others showed off full-toothed smiles. Some models had fierce faces, but “smized”in true Tyra Banks fashion. These subtle changes in motion did a nice job of maintaining the audience’s attention.
Overall, the show achieved its goal of showcasing fashion in a cutting-edge manner, offering variation through music and model poses. Identities promised diversity and expressed it well through its clothing and model selection. Identities 2017 offered a well-engineered look at futuristic fashion.

The Art Society at Harvard Business School is striving to bring MBA students into greater contact with the arts at a finance-focused institution. Organizing a variety of events, curating public art on the Allston campus, and making treks to local and out-of-state cultural institutions, the Art Society looks to increase the vibrancy of the arts at HBS. Co-presidents Beth Peters and Dori Gilinski spoke with The Crimson about the events that the Art Society puts together.
The society has run several outings to local museums, such as tours of the Harvard Art Museums and the Museum of Fine Arts, in addition to treks farther afield. “Some flagship events that we have include two treks to New York, one per semester. And they’re basically a weekend where we take a group of about 20 people to go to different museums, meet with art industry figures, go on tours of different artists studios,” said Peters. Gilinski discussed a Miami trek, a December visit to Art Basel, which is one of the world’s largest art fairs. “You have some of the best galleries opening up, and you have lectures, and you have talks, and you also have parties. So we take a group of students together down there, and it’s kind of real exposure to the actual art world, and the actual art market,” said Gilinski.
Current club member Mette S. Andersen talked about her experience with the New York trek. “We were shown around Sotheby's before opening hours … Later we had an hourlong chat with a famous art collector about his passions and how he started, and watched amazing performances by very talented students in a private performance. The great appreciation of all art forms in the people that we have met has been truly inspiring,” she wrote in an email.
While the Art Society itself is not explicitly a pre-professional organization, and its events are more designed for immersion in the arts, it’s a bit of both, according to Gilinski. “I think there’s an overarching kind of mission of being a society that gives students at HBS engagement with the arts, people who otherwise might feel uncomfortable. They wouldn’t visit a museum on their own, or they wouldn’t know how to approach an art exhibition. …  But I think there is a really strong interest for a lot of students going into careers, I would say, in arts and culture, and we are very much a vehicle for that. We bring in speakers from places like Christie’s and Sotheby’s, and we do a lot of help recruiting for organizations.”
Additionally, the Society sees art as a complement to any future career in business. “We also encourage our members and the HBS community more broadly to involve art in their lives after they leave,” said Peters. “One example of this is we had a talk recently on how to get a nonprofit board position, so even if people are going into more of a corporate career, still encouraging people to get involved in areas they’re passionate about, and for members often that’s the arts.”
Art Society gatherings, like the “Surrealist Party” this past February, also serve as a welcome change of pace from the more formal social events of the business school. “I think at HBS there’s a lot of very club-based events, but we wanted to do something a bit different,” said Peters. “So we rented out a warehouse space in Somerville, catered some nice food, ... decorated it in a more quirky style, and we had some live music. It was all just a bit different, and people dressed up in an appropriately surreal fashion. The feedback we got was that it was quite refreshing.”
Peters also discussed events at which students actually get involved with art making itself. “We’ve had some paint night events. We had a workshop at the Harvard Art Museums recently where people went and saw some of Matisse’s cutouts and then went and actually created them themselves,” said Peters.
The Art Society actually has another Matisse-related event coming up: they plan to make a trip to the recently opened exhibition of the artist’s work at the MFA. “Right now I’m trying to organize a tour with the curator of the exhibition for HBS students, but even if you’re not an HBS student, definitely go see it. There are some of the best Matisse works ever in there,” said Gilinski.
However, some of the most essential work the Art Society does is right on the business school campus: the curation of the Schwartz collection. Endowed by Canadian hedge fund manager Gerry Schwartz, the collection is the body of artworks displayed on the walls of the Business School. “As part of the Art Society we collaborate with the Schwartz collection on a piece to add to the collection every year,” said Peters. The sculpture program acquires year-long loans of sculptures, which are featured on the lawn. Currently on view is a work by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa. “We get incredible artists, and we work with the administration to get pieces that are kind of representative of the student body,” said Gilinski.

New England-based photographer Roscoe M. Curry, perhaps better known by his Instagram handle “Ross the Photo Boss,” can sometimes be seen around Harvard’s campus photographing student events. Curry held a variety of nine-to-five jobs for years before leaving the corporate desk for a digital camera. His words of advice for aspiring young photographers? “Never forget why you fell in love with taking photos in the first place,” he says. Curry sat down with the Crimson to talk about his unusual start in photography and how he views his craft.
The Harvard Crimson: What was it about photography that first captured your interest?
Roscoe M. Curry: I always loved pictures and images, and I used different websites to look at really creative photos and beautiful pictures. I love beautiful paintings. So that’s what really got me attracted to photography in general. I decided to buy my first DSLR when I saw a photo of a Portuguese man-of-war. So I saw that one day while working a job that I hated, because I hate office jobs. The whole time, I was thinking about getting a camera. And then I saw that photo and it just sparked.
THC: What job was this?
RMC: I was selling tires. Sitting at a desk all day. I hated it, I hate sitting at a desk, I hate jobs like that. There’s no expression, it’s not creative. So I saw that photo, and I bought my first camera. I think a month later, I quit that job.
THC: That was a really quick turnover. How did you feel when you made that decision?
RMC: Yeah, well, I mean, it just kind of felt right. I can’t, it’s hard to explain. But it felt right, so I just went with it. And a few months later I shot a wedding.
THC: What were you doing for the time period between quitting your job and booking your first client?
I was just kind of shooting and practicing. When I was thinking about getting a camera, one of the first things I was told was you don’t want to shoot automatic, you want to shoot your camera in manual mode. So right out of the box, I never shot automatic. [The camera] stayed in manual mode so I was taking hundreds and hundreds of just awful shots. Knew nothing, but I eventually figured it out, and I loved every single moment of it. At first, I wasn’t even shooting models or anything. I was just shooting at state parks, my ex-girlfriend, stuff like that. But then when I went to Boston Portrait Meet—you can put the hashtag in there if you want, it’s #BostonPortraitMeet—that’s when my love for taking photos of people and portraits really kind of started. That’s when the ball really started rolling on that, and ever since then that’s what I’ve been doing.
THC: On your website, you say that your work focuses on beauty, portraiture, and fashion. Why those three genres?
RMC: I think it’s just kind of what feels right to me. I find people beautiful, you know what I mean? So I guess an artist is going to capture or paint what they find beauty in. Landscapes and stuff like that just don’t do it for me. I think they’re cool, but I mean like, if you notice—my landscape photography and cities and stuff like that, they’re really unsaturated so there’s not a lot of color in those photos. But if you look at photos of people, there’s contrast, there’s color, they’re a lot brighter, just because I find people bring color and difference to everything. I love that. I love people.
THC: Where do you find artistic inspiration for your photography?
RMC: Everywhere. I wish I could give you something more pointed though. Instagram, maybe? I feel like we kind of all work off each other. Like, I’ll see something that’s really cool, I’ll say, “Dude, that’s awesome, I really want to try it,” and then someone else will see my stuff.
THC: You often make appearances here on campus. What is it like photographing at a Harvard event?
RMC: It’s super fun. Super fun. It’s awesome.

After eight years of being off the air, the fifth season of “Prison Break” quickly returns to the story seemingly finished in 2009. The revival is slated to run nine episodes, substantially less than the previous seasons, and is confirmed to be the last season. Featuring constant action, against-all-odds survival, and the same reliable characters, “Prison Break” fails to either impress or disappoint its fans.
The show leaves off with Michael’s apparent death via electrocution, while Sara breaks out of jail in the now ironically titled finale, “The Final Break.” However, as all “Prison Break” fans should have learned over the years, the main characters of “Prison Break” are invincible and apparently immortal. Hence Michael’s survival should come as little surprise.
After a lengthy opening credit scene, channeling many images from the show’s glory days in season one, Michael (Wentworth Miller) appears and says, “Not all deaths are the same. Some are real, some are a story.” Indeed, this story of his deception seems to be the driving factor and sets the tone for the season. Known for his meticulous planning and incredible intelligence, Michael has remained hidden from his friends—not to mention his wife and son—for unknown reasons.
Michael gives the first clue of his survival to, of all people, T-Bag—a sleazy, cunning, double-crossing psychopath—as he leaves jail. T-Bag quickly finds Lincoln, Michael’s muscle-man and impulsive brother, who launches into a mission to uncover the truth. Within minutes, he is followed and attacked by terrorists who are somehow able to car-jack Lincoln’s car and send him flying into a lake, though his front windshield miraculously lacks a scratch. Directly after, the same terrorist group breaks into Sara’s, Michael’s wife, house, shooting her new husband and attempting to kill her and her son, before being deterred by police sirens.
Lincoln then decides to travel to Yemen with a fellow former inmate, and miraculously survives a surprise attack by a group of five terrorists. At the end of the episode, the pair finally finds Michael in—wait for it—a prison. However, he goes under a false name, is known as a terrorist, and refuses to acknowledge his brother and friend. The episode ends with Lincoln crying out to Michael, and Michael blatantly ignoring him.
In addition to the similar plot sequence, the acting is almost exactly the same as in the original series. Robert Knepper’s T-Bag has the same presumptuous tone of voice, threatening stance, and nervous tic that makes the audience quickly weary of his presence. Meanwhile, Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) still acts like a buff jock and fails to exhibit real emotion. Even when digging up his brother’s grave, he fails to give the camera a genuine glance. However, the portrayal of Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies) compellingly depicts utter disillusionment—she is unfazed at the idea of Michael’s survival (a nuanced change from the original show). Overall, more of the same, but in upcoming episodes it will be interesting to see how the main character, Michael, is portrayed, given that he did not play a major role in the first episode.
Why is Michael acting the way he is? Why is he thought of as a terrorist? And most pressingly–why would he allow his family and friends to think he was dead for so long? Those questions will most likely drive the rest of the season forward. Although the episode was entertaining and nostalgic for old fans, its failure to change or adapt will prevent a widening of its viewing base.
Memorialized in our hearts, and also on Netflix, the first season of the show will remain the golden age of “Prison Break,” a time when its plot felt purposeful and fun. Its subsequent seasons, including this one, feel forced into creation by aimless terrorists and unlikely events. There is still hope that the upcoming episodes will reveal a clear and compelling motive behind the plot, but if not, “Prison Break” needs to be given a permanent break.

When considering Boston’s contemporary art scene, it’d be easy to call the city a little sister of New York. But describing Boston only in terms of its rival metropolis obscures some of the subtleties of the city’s cultural ecosystem.
Most obviously, the vast gap in the population sizes of New York and Boston contributes directly to some of the differences in their art scenes. It’s not surprising that a city of 8.5 million sells more art than one just shy of 700,000.
Randy Kennedy, a writer for The New York Times who covers national art news, spoke to some of the distinctions in magnitude that impact art production in these two cities. “I think that no city in the United States, besides maybe L.A., has the kind of concentration of galleries that New York has, and I think probably in the world, only London rivals it,” he said. “Even if artists are not particularly commercial, the presence of 200-some odd galleries in Chelsea is still a lodestone. And New York is still a place where artists from a lot of different cities can come and know that they’re in this very dense web of artists and what’s happening now.”
Andrew Witkin, the director of Barbara Krakow Gallery on Newbury Street, estimated New York’s total number of galleries at roughly 450, and Boston’s at around 30.
The owner of Gallery Kayafas in the South End, Arlette Kayafas, was realistic about the logistics of operating in a smaller city. “It’s about numbers,” she said. “When you put us proportionally next to New York, we have less visitors, we have less collectors.”
At least some of Boston’s status as second-class art city seems to be a matter of perception. Cate McQuaid, a correspondent for The Boston Globe, has been writing about the city’s art world for over 20 years. “There’s this long history of the identity of the Boston arts community as being the ‘country mouse’ cousin to the ‘city mouse’ of New York,” she said.
But McQuaid acknowledged that some of this stereotype is in fact based on an older Boston.  “Bostonians were very conservative about contemporary art. When I started writing, they were just more interested in Impressionism, and that has really changed. Boston is a place where you can go to see really great contemporary art now, and 20 years ago, that wasn’t the case.”
Byers also noted Boston’s historically conservative tastes. “Boston historically has had a less experimental audience, and New York is sort of famous for its almost even jaded audiences because they’re so used to pushing it so far all the time,” he said.
Even as Boston’s art scene has matured, New York continues to enjoy its status as the vital hub of contemporary artistic practice. Kennedy commented on how an existing network is an attraction in itself. “New York, even though it’s so difficult and expensive for younger artists, it probably still is the place that, if you’re a contemporary artist born in Boston, you’re looking toward New York to want to live in New York, or now Philadelphia or L.A. or Detroit, places where there are large communities of artists,” he said.
A relative lack of artistic activity—or even just the impression of such—snowballs into tangible impacts for the valuation of Boston’s art, according to Byers. “It’s always been a kind of issue for the few local galleries that they may even be showing the same artists, but the purchase and conversation that a collector might have in New York can be considered as more validating,” he said.
Kayafas confirmed that introducing  new artists in a Boston gallery can be problematic. “It’s difficult to show new artists, because a majority of the collectors like to have an artist that’s validated,” she said. “And so if you’re showing somebody for the first time, their prices are going to be at a lower price point, and so you have to build their reputation. So I think in a way that’s challenging for galleries, and they don’t take on a lot of new people for that reason—because our rents are going up too.”
McQuaid said that local artists accordingly felt underrepresented by their local galleries. She spoke to how she thought artists in Boston might interpret this phenomenon. “I think Boston artists would complain that the commercial galleries don’t show them enough,” she said.
Janowitz said that he felt this issue of recognition was due in part to a lack of full institutional support for local artists. “What I’ve felt like for the past 40 years is that the institutions do a disservice to the artists here, because they segregate Boston artists 90 percent of the time from their big shows.” As examples of shows and prizes that tend to highlight Boston’s artists only in a local context, he cited the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum’s recent New England biennial, the Maud Morgan Prize at the MFA (honoring a Massachusetts woman artist), and the Foster Prize at the Institute of Contemporary Art (which highlights Boston-area artists working at national or international level) to demonstrate this point.
“The curators are choosing the New York artists, because the curators in every other city are choosing the New York artists, and they’re the same artists,” Janowitz said. “I think the curators are scared, and the collectors, everyone is scared—if you’re going to spend 10,000, 20,000, or 100,000 on an artwork, you want to have a stamp of approval.”
Witkin, for his part, said that he tried not only to show Boston artists but to also put them in conversation with other works at his gallery. “There are plenty of different amazing artists in Boston, some of which we show, many of which other of our colleagues show. There’s a tremendous amount of the type of work that’s being made and shown here,” he said. “I’ve been here for 18 years and the diversity of people collecting has really increased. There’s always more to be done and there’s plenty more to be done in terms of making it more and more diverse.”
Shellburne Thurber, a photographer who has been working in Boston since the 1980s, has exhibited work in many local galleries. She herself has felt the frustration of trying to show new art in a city that has been traditionally less receptive to contemporary work. “It makes it hard if you don’t have support,” she said. “Then the work doesn't sell and the galleries have a hard time staying in business, and the artists have a hard time making a living. It’s all about perception really. I would argue that there are some really amazing people working here.”
As Deitsch spoke in her office, a rehearsal was taking place right next door, in the lobby of Harvard’s Carpenter Center for Visual Arts. Members of Futurefarmers, an artist collective, were getting ready for their performance to accompany new exhibition “Errata—Brief Interruptions.”
 “Most every artist in the room next door to us has a teaching job. So these people are connected to an academic institution, generally speaking,” Deitsch said. “If you’re thinking about what makes the Boston art community, the universities are the driving factor. Most of the artists who live here and have careers here are usually employed by one of the schools as adjuncts or full professors.”
There seemed to be a widespread agreement that the concentration of academic institutions in Boston has an impact on its contemporary art scene. Byers saw this as an asset for the city’s art dialogue. “What this area really offers is an incredibly rich institutional culture, between the museums and the universities, the really strong and really interesting group of art historians, art curators, and art administrators, and artists who are teaching and affiliated with the universities,” he said.
Witkin suggested that this academic mindset might set the tone for some of Boston’s artmaking. “If you’re going to have that much research, investigation, academic learning, certainly you’re going to have interesting things going on and interesting conversations,” he said.
And in this way, Boston may posses some unique advantages for training future members of the art world. Witkin pointed out the number of curators now holding major positions in New York who spent time during their careers in Boston. Witkin cited as examples Jessica Morgan, who was a curator at the ICA and now serves as director at the Dia Art Foundation; Nicholas Baume, who was a curator at the ICA and is now the director of the Public Art Fund; and Kathy Halbreich, who was the director at the List Visual Art Center at MIT and is now assistant director at the Museum of Modern Art.
In addition, Kennedy pointed out how an academic atmosphere might impact the type of art itself that is conceived and produced in Boston. “Because of the number of schools in Boston, you’ll always have, attached to Harvard or MIT, artistic experimentation,” he said. “MIT, in particular, is the fit between science and art. There’s a lot of money and support to be had for artists who are really trying experimental things.”
To illustrate his point, Kennedy mentioned recent coverage he had done on “The Enemy,” a new work at the MIT Open Documentary Lab by photojournalist Karim Ben Khelifa. The photo exhibition-turned-virtual reality installation uses VR to bring the audience into contact with soldiers from opposite sides of longstanding global conflicts. “It’s unlikely that a gallery or the commercial art world would have supported something like that,” Kennedy said. “It comes out of institutional support from universities that are really interested in art.”
Byers mentioned similar examples of interdisciplinary practice in describing the process of putting together the Foster Prize Exhibition at the ICA. “In organizing the Foster Prize Exhibition, I was struck by the number of conversations I had with artists about a kind of interdisciplinary interest in and influence by disciplines and fields outside of art,” he said. “And that may have to do with the fact that all of them are faculty at universities, at Harvard and Brandeis, and so there are collegial conversations with other professors and other departments contributing to that.”
One example of the close connections between Boston’s art institutions and universities is the recent partnership between the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and Tufts University. The agreement between the two institutions now puts SMFA under the Tufts banner. Nancy F. Bauer ’82, who now serves as the dean of SMFA, noted that the nature of Boston as a university city might make it more appropriate than New York for training younger artists. “It may be a better place to get an education. Just at the level of the lack of pressure and the fact that we’re living in a city with this incredibly high concentration of excellent schools. There are a lot of students around, a student culture—it’s a little bit more of a navigable city,” she said.
Over the past 20 years, a large number of Boston’s galleries have moved from their locations on pricey Newbury Street to the South End’s SoWa district, short for south of Washington Street. Low rents, easy parking, and pedestrian-friendly First Friday events have made this area a central hub of Boston’s art scene.
Kayafas, whose gallery is located in this district, noted that the concentration of galleries creates a collaborative atmosphere. “There are over twenty-five galleries on this street, we’re all totally different. We all have a different aesthetic, but we’re cooperative in how we try to promote things as a group. And it’s collegial, more so than other places,” she said.
Byers echoed her impressions of a community mindset. “I think there’s much more collaboration between institutions,” he said. “There’s a real sense of collegiality and friendship amongst traders and museum directors, and that has meant that there’s much more conversation between collectors and patrons and a less factional environment.”
Speaking from her own experience as dean at SMFA, Bauer corroborated this sentiment. She spoke to multiple types of collaboration that the school participates in with other art schools in the area. “There’s a lot of collaboration among art schools. We have a consortium of art schools in the Fenway area, with us, MassArt, the Boston Architectural Center, the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music, Boston Conservatory, and Emerson College. We get together and we talk about the kinds of issues and problems we have. There are issues like, people are worried about having their child get a BFA, for example—is that going to get them a job? It is as expensive as getting a BA or BS,” she said.
Regardless of its real or perceived past, Boston has in the past 10 years undoubtedly seen a rise in the visibility of and support for contemporary art. “Institutionally it’s exploded,” Deitsch said. “I would say in the last five years there’s been an enormous uptick of institutional support of contemporary art. I don’t think Boston has ever really been known for embracing contemporary art.”
In 2006, the ICA opened its new waterfront building, much larger than its previous Back Bay site. The Rose Art Museum at Brandeis narrowly escaped closure and the sale of its collection in 2011, and instead revived itself with a $1.7 million renovation. In 2011, the Museum of Fine Arts opened the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Arts. Now, under the new direction of director Matthew Teitelbaum, the MFA has been making efforts to immerse some pieces from its contemporary collections into some of its modern and classical galleries. And in 2013, the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum opened its new contemporary wing.
In this effort to bring Boston’s art scene into the 21st century, many museums have also turned to programming to bring traffic through the doors. The ICA, for example, has a new series of events titled “ICA After 5” on Friday evenings, when gallery viewing is accompanied by tastings, demonstrations, and workshops. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum has a Third Thursdays event offering music and a cash bar in their courtyard, in addition to artist talks. This fall, the MFA started a series of “Overnight” parties, four after-hours events celebrating contemporary exhibitions.
“They’re doing good marketing to younger people,” said McQuaid. “There’s an element to the museum going public that is retirees and collectors who have taken time to accumulate wealth. These museums really have to be strategic in developing their audiences, and one way to do that is through contemporary art, and party because a lot of contemporary art is a different experience from a museum. It’s not just about looking at a painting, it’s often interactive, it’s often immersive, it’s often about performance art that is just happening that one night. So it becomes more of an event, and more something that you want to share on social media. It’s a completely different approach than museums were taking 20 years ago.”
More than just museums, the city of Boston itself has shown an interest in promoting local cultural activities. In 2014, Mayor Martin J. Walsh appointed Julie Burros, Boston’s first Chief of Arts and Culture in more than 20 years. A year later, the mayor announced Boston Creates, a cultural planning process focused on supporting the arts in Boston. The mission statement reads: “We want to understand the creative capital of Boston and create a plan that will prioritize, coordinate, and align public and private resources to strengthen this creative capital over the long term.” New public art on the Rose Kennedy Greenway in downtown Boston, for example, offers temporary sites for visual arts and installation.
Kayafas cited Burros’ new role as an effort on the part of the city to pay more attention to artists, but said that she thinks more remains to be done. “That’s visibility of caring about the arts. But if there were space that could be subsidized in some way, so that artists could afford studio space, that would be good.”
Indeed, space seems to be a significant issue for artists in the Boston area. Deitsch spoke to some of the issues she had seen impacting artists in the area. “Studio space is very difficult for artists to maintain here,” she said. Thurber also mentioned the scarcity and expense of living and working space in the city. “I think it’s so exorbitantly expensive here,” she said. “If you’re going to be an artist in Boston that’s a big part of it—where are you going to live?”
Kayafas had seen artists she’d interacted with struggle with similar space issues. “I think that studio space prices are getting so high. And if there’s a building that has been studio space for a long time, it starts to look really good to somebody in the area who wants to tear it down and turn it into high end condos,” she said. “Especially in the South End, there’s very little space left, and it used to be a space where you could find studios. Now, I think there’s a waitlist for most studios.”
Janowitz explained that the building in the South End that his studio is located in, where 40 or 50 artists have studios, has only remained because of an eccentric landlord who refuses to sell to developers. “It’s like an island of old Boston amidst luxury condos going up all around. It’s not going to be here forever.”
It’s not a fix that’s easily remedied. A report in Standard and Poor’s last year predicted that Boston home prices will rise 24 percent by 2020.
Many believe that more space in Boston needs to be devoted to artists. Deitsch pointed out two positive examples that could be a model for the city going forward. One way to secure more space is through universities. “I think people who are connected to universities sometimes can get that,” she said. “You know Harvard’s wonderful, it gives faculty studio spaces, but not everywhere does that, and either the universities need to step up and they have to start getting spaces for their faculty, or for visiting artists, to bring more artists here, or the city has to figure something out.”
She added that the city may have a responsibility in this matter as well. “Chicago for example has a different model, there’s a big apartment-gallery model and there’s different generations of artists that stay there and they usually bring up the next generation. Here, it’s more transient. People will stay, but more people will leave.” Keeping artists in Boston—who in turn, breed more contemporary art activity—may be largely dependent on making it more attractive for them to work in the city. While New York is a difficult city to compete with as an artistic hub, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago may be less so.
But government initiatives aren’t the only ways to enact positive change in Boston’s arts scene. Local collaboration also may be able to help strengthen the artistic community moving forward. Kayafas sees this as continuing to benefit the city. “I’m a member of the Boston Art Dealers Association, and we’ve been working hard the past several years to try to unite everybody into one group, because we have amazing artists in Boston and amazing institutions, amazing galleries and lectures,” she said. “But we’re now always aware of what each other is doing, and so we’d be much stronger if we in some way could coordinate activities.”
Byers also spoke of the opportunity to give greater attention to art coming out of the area. “I would absolutely stand up for local galleries and say they need that kind of support,” he said. “Often a gallery might show artists here in Boston before they’ve had any kind of national exposure, and so if you’re a collector and in conversation with them, it’s only going to benefit you in terms of your access to that kind of art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life and Undergraduate Council recently reformulated the process by which students can create recognized organizations in an effort to decrease redundancy in the extracurricular composition of the College. Under the new framework, nascent clubs will exist in an intermediate state for a year before the UC, as advised by the OSL, will vote whether or not to grant them fully recognized status, along with the associated resources and privileges.
We commend the OSL and the UC for tackling this important issue. The egregious amount of overlap in the College’s 442 recognized organizations fails to allow the UC to allocate funding as effectively as possible, and this problem can spread student talent and passion about a given issue too thinly.
Nonetheless, there are serious flaws in the OSL and UC’s new plan. Its singular focus on ensuring new clubs are not superfluous makes no effort to address redundancy within the existing body of College-approved organizations, and will ultimately be ineffective in club consolidation as long as it does not address existing problems. A better policy would enable the OSL and UC to take a critical look at the 442 clubs that currently exist, and aim to decrease overlap in their functions by spearheading relevant mergers and cuts.
The other side of the OSL and UC’s plan that which pertains to new organizations is likewise problematic. While we appreciate that these governing bodies aim to only allow the formation of unique clubs with auspicious futures, the relative dearth of clarity regarding the year-long intermediate period is cause for concern. Without adequate support—which must go beyond the meetings with administrators new clubs must have per the policy—and provision of financial assistance and the ability to book spaces, clubs that might be favorably reviewed a year into their existence may unfortunately not survive that long.
The methods by which the UC will implement its newfound power also have the potential to be worrying. As we have argued, the UC Rules Committee’s increased oversight of extracurricular life on campus necessitates that it be held accountable for using its influence properly. We therefore call on the Committee to release and publicize quantitative standards, such as those regarding membership size, by which it will evaluate would-be recognized clubs. These would be in lieu of qualitative standards that would allow UC members to nix clubs based on disagreements with clubs’ stated aims.
The College visibly prides itself on its diverse, comprehensive body of student organizations and on students’ ability to fill deficiencies they perceive by creating clubs of their own. The OSL and UC would do well to revise their policy to scrutinize existing clubs and to ensure that new clubs are adequately resourced for success. They must also clarify and make fair the standards by which the UC will judge clubs. Only through these revisions to the existing policy can the OSL and UC consolidate and strengthen Harvard’s extracurricular life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Thursday, Harvard’s Black Men’s Forum brought radio personality Charlamagne tha God to campus for “Black Privilege: A Discussion and Book Signing”. Charlamagne is well known as the host of the popular hip-hop-based radio show The Breakfast Club. He’s also well known for his track record of transphobia, homophobia, and disgusting treatment of black women. I brought reciepts: he’s slutshamed Amber Rose, compared Caitlyn Jenner to Rachel Dolezal, and explicitly erased black women’s monumental contribution to black liberation. His friendship with Tomi Lahren, the controversial ex-Blaze reporter who’s well known for her racism, is particularly criticized. Charlamagne claims to speak for the black community, but in reality he represents a violent exclusion of the majority of the black community: black queer people, black women, black trans people, black nonbinary people. BMF thought it was a good idea to invite him to campus and purchase 150 copies of his recent book.
I’ve been proud to defend the black community in this column. I love this community with all my heart. But time and time again, I am excluded from it because I do not fit into a narrowly defined, hypermasculine, heteronormative, cisgender definition of Blackness. A wide swathe of the black community continually makes it clear that I, and people like me, do not belong.
This is not a Harvard-specific phenomena. Black cisheterosexual men consistently dominate the Black narrative, and construct Blackness around their own experiences. Audre Lorde, Alvin Ailey, and Lorraine Hansberry are erased because their queerness, their womanness runs against the dominant narrative. One type of blackness has become the blackness, and dictates the membership and identity of the entire community.
This has dangerous ramifications. When intersectionality is rejected for one-dimensionality, the erased identities become vulnerable. Due to a rigid black masculinity, for example, black women and femmes are reduced to Others. Kendrick Lamar is lauded as a hero for the black community, but he consistently erases black women from his liberation project. The revolutionary cover to his magnum opus, To Pimp A Butterfly, portrays black children triumphantly stuntin in front of the White House, representing a righteous rebellion against American white supremacy. But in this pro-black tableau what’s the one thing missing? Anyone who’s not a cisgender man.
Kendrick ignores black feminine-of-center claim to blackness, and in doing so he reduces them to rhetorical strategies, dramatic foils, and male-owned objects. TPAB uses black women as personifications of soul-sucking fame, the Devil, and the American prison machine. The lead single from Kendrick’s newest album (the otherwise genius) DAMN., “HUMBLE.”, thinly disguises the objectification of black women behind “black positivity.” The black community consistently rejects the personhood of any type of intersectional identity. And we, those too complex for their rigid definitions, suffer for it.
Harvard’s not exempt from this. There’s a misconception on this campus that queer blackness, trans blackness, femme blackness, Muslim blackness, are all “special cases” divergent from some “normal” blackness. But that’s simply not the case. There is no pro-blackness, no black positivity, no black community without accounting for our complex and intersectional identities. Organizations like BMF can’t just switch intersectionality on and off as they will. They can’t invite a transphobic misogynist one day and host an open forum on inclusivity the next (we should also have a serious and honest conversation about whether an organization regulated to binary masculinity is even worth perpetuating). We cannot continue to fail to offer queer and nonbinary black students institutional support and space. Black women and femmes cannot be an addendum to our liberation project. Political advocacy for Black Muslims and Afro-Latinx people (supporting an intersectional feminism that lifts up Black Muslim women, defending undocumented Caribbean and African immigrants, fighting the U.S. travel ban, etc.) must be an integral part of our general advocacy efforts. Blackness can no longer be an exclusive club on this campus. Charlamagne should know that his hate and prejudice are not welcome here.
It’s worth noting that this is not an attempt to demonize blackness; the black community is not the sole problem. The white queer community consistently fails to show up for black queer people, and continues to whitewash the past and present of the queer community. Feminism is consistently whitewashed as well, as well as purged of all understanding of the nuances of sexuality and gender identity. It’s also certainly true that transphobia, toxic masculinity, and misogyny are not purely black phenomena—I’ve faced just as much homophobia from white America. I hope that non-black readers of this article will recognize their own communities reflected within, and understand what they, individually and collectively, need to do better.
But it hurts that the community I’ve come to appreciate, to love, to commit my time and energies to, the community whose history and future is rooted in oppression and protest, does not (at least not in full) reciprocate my love or see me as part of their narrative. I hope the black readers of this article think very carefully about how they participate in the exclusion of intersectional identities from the greater community, and how they can embrace a beautifully complex and inclusive definition of blackness going forward.

The first thing I noticed the first time I ever visited Harvard a year ago was The World’s Only Curious George Store. Standing brightly and proudly at one of the three corners of the Square, it struck me as unique, clever, and significant––a symbol of innocence and childhood steps away from the world’s most prestigious university.
Today it is threatened with an uncertain fate, under pressure from the building’s lead investor to repurpose the building. There have been attempts to designate the building as historical, in an attempt to save another part of Harvard Square from falling to gentrification. As odd and niche as it is, I’m sure most of us can agree the Curious George store should stand. The last thing Harvard Square needs is another overblown parody of commercialism, the likes of a Tatte or Urban Outfitters, that tends to serve outsiders and visitors more than it does Harvard students.
Yes, you might say, isn’t Curious George the same thing? Its campiness and overstocked interior evokes that of a museum gift shop, and clearly is not meant for the college student demographic. But, I’ll reply, you miss the point: Its uniqueness and historical relevance cannot be razed. We’ve got twenty cafes in the Square, and similar numbers of clothing stores. We need some sense of uniqueness. Harvard Square is not a strip mall. (That’s what New Haven is for.)
In my experience, it seems as if precious few students here know exactly what and where the store is. During Opening Days last August, I went with a friend and purchased a shirt from the store. Whenever I wear the shirt, fellow-students always laugh and smile, and ask me where I purchased it. Many express surprise: “I didn’t know there was a Curious George store!”
I’ll smile but remain bemused: How does one not know where the store is? It occupies the single best piece of real estate in Harvard Square. Granted, we become accustomed to our surroundings quickly—it’s a rite of passage, for example, when a freshman finally takes the splendor and glory that is Annenberg Hall for granted and views it as just a dining hall.
And I will admit that unlike the two other stores that mark the vertices of Harvard Square, CVS and The Coop, students are rarely occasioned to visit Curious George in his home. When was the last time you visited the store, if ever? Yes, we’re college students—the store isn’t exactly tailored to our demographic, but one should at least visit it once.
Over winter break a few months ago, I happened to dine with one of my favorite high school teachers. One of the things we discussed was the role of children’s books, full of whimsy and fantasy and allegory.
“It’s a curious thing,” she said, “that the books that stay with us the most tend to be the books we read in childhood or as young adults.”
She was right: children’s books are irrevocable reminders of the beauty and ineffability of childhood. Whenever I read Madeleine, or The Cat in the Hat, or, yes, Curious George, to my seven-year-old sister, I’m always struck by how much these books have the power to entertain and amaze even adults. There is a reason why the humorist Stephen Butler Leacock once declared, “Personally, I would sooner have written Alice in Wonderland than the Encyclopedia Britannica.”
We must remember our childhood, a time that for many of us was full of dreams, of imagination, of innocence. I remember all the games I would play with friends, my brother, or my favorite stuffed animal, and dream of the future. Today, we reside in the world’s greatest university, a place where those dreams should be closer than ever to reach. And yet the purity of thought that characterizes childhood is often lost among us. Yes, we are not children. But can it be said we are adults? Legally, yes, but we all deal in one way or another the many worries, hopes and fears that characterize the turmoil of late adolescence, as we take stock of what our lives are to be in decades ahead.
Which is why I say: The next time you’re in the Square, go visit Curious George at his store, while it still stands in limbo. You might buy a shirt, as I did. You might stand around and look at the books that once entertained you, years ago. You might even recapture some of your childhood.
And in the midst of the turmoil that perpetually rocks this campus, and our lives, that might be the best thing for our mind and soul. There’s a Curious George inside all of us. We just have to become reacquainted with him.

Loc Truong, the College’s Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs, is stepping down from the role May 31 to become the Assistant Dean of Student Support Services at MIT after 13 years at Harvard.
Truong was named to the directorship—a position within Harvard’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion—in September 2015. As director, Truong served as the College’s point person for student organizations and supported first generation college students, undocumented students, and foster youth.
Truong’s departure comes at a time of administrative uncertainty for the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, a part of the College’s Office of Student Life created less than two years ago. In October, Emelyn A. dela Peña, then the College’s assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion, who headed the office, left Harvard for a position at Washington University in St. Louis.
In November, O’Dair said that a search for dela Peña's replacement was ongoing and would likely last through at least December 2016. Dela Pena’s position is still vacant.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced Truong’s departure in an email sent to undergraduates Monday afternoon.
“Loc has made a lasting impression here at Harvard as a dedicated student advocate, friend, and colleague,” O’Dair wrote in the email. “While I and countless students and colleagues will miss him deeply, I am also thrilled for Loc to be taking on this new, important position.”
In his new role at MIT, Truong will work to advise and support students, especially those whose “personal concerns” may interfere with their academic success, O’Dair wrote. He will also work with MIT faculty and staff, help develop school-wide programming, and will generally advise MIT affiliates on “issues that impact the student experience,” according to O’Dair.
While at Harvard, Truong pioneered various initiatives including the Diversity Peer Educator Program. Prior to acting as director of diversity and inclusion programs, Truong worked as the assistant director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations from 2008 to 2015.
Truong could not immediately be reached for comment Monday afternoon.
In her email, O’Dair wrote that she was aware Truong’s decision to leave Harvard might have consequences for the student body.
“We know the importance of Loc’s position, and the impact his role has in our community,” O’Dair wrote.
She outlined an “interim support plan” the College will follow to ensure what she called Truong’s “critical work” continues. Beginning May 31, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Fellow Ileana F. M. Casellas-Katz will step up to oversee the Diversity Peer Educators program and will become responsible for advising and supporting students, while Director of the Office of International Education Camila L. Nardozzi will partner with College Associate Dean and Chief of Staff Joan Rouse to oversee support for undocumented students through the summer of 2017. Katie M. Derzon will continue in her role as Fellow for Undocumented Students, a position Harvard created in February.
O’Dair added that Truong will continue to be available to undergraduates until May 31 and encouraged students to reach out to him.
“I ask that you all join me in wishing Loc the very best for his continued success at MIT,” O’Dair concluded her email.

University President Drew G. Faust said she is working “very closely” with Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise on a survey of the department’s culture after reports that members of two men’s teams created and distributed sexually explicit documents roiled the program late last year.
Faust said in an interview Friday that she is working with Scalise as consultants from National Consortium for Academics and Sports conduct a survey of student athletes, coaches, and staff and review the culture of the department’s 42 varsity programs.
"Bob Scalise has been consulting very closely with me about the planned climate survey, and I think that’s a really important and serious undertaking,” Faust said. “And as you know, he has now chosen a group of consultants, a company to work on that, and I’m eager to see their results and their suggestions, and I know he’s committed to working on that."
Though Faust is not usually involved in the Athletics Department, she has taken a more active role in the program recently. After The Crimson reported that the 2012 men’s soccer team created an explicit “scouting report” ranking freshmen recruits on the women’s team based on perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance, Faust ordered the Office of General Counsel to review the team. And after investigators found that the team continued the practice after 2012, Scalise cancelled the rest of the men’s soccer season.
In November, The Crimson reported that the men’s cross country team had created yearly spreadsheets including “sexually explicit” comments about members of the women’s team. Again, Harvard’s team of lawyers also looked into the team’s conduct, and the Athletics Department put the team on “athletic probation.” The Athletics Department announced that it would commission a professional review of the program’s culture.
The goal of the review is to create “the best possible environment in which to learn and compete” for student athletes, according to Senior Associate Athletics Director Nathan Fry. The survey asks athletes to respond to questions about team traditions, conflict resolution processes, and the response to discrimination in the department, among other topics.
Representatives from the Athletics Department have also started meeting with focus groups of student athletes to discuss the program’s culture and its impact on students at the College.

A Mather House resident suspected of having tuberculosis has been released from isolation after two weeks, although the individual will continue to undergo treatment for the disease, according to Harvard University Health Services director Paul J. Barreira.
In March, Barreira alerted Mather residents to a potential case of tuberculosis in the House. Since then, Barreira said that those who were at risk for the disease have been notified, and no other individuals with symptoms of tuberculosis have been identified.
According to the Center for Disease Control, tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease which, if left untreated, can be fatal. The Cambridge Public Health Department reported an average of six confirmed tuberculosis cases annually in Cambridge from 2012 to 2016, and reported three cases last year.
HUHS worked in conjunction with the Cambridge Public Health Department and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to identify and contact individuals at risk of infection.
Barreira said while Harvard’s tuberculosis case is still unconfirmed—the individual’s test results are expected in about a month—the individual exhibiting symptoms was put under self-isolation and treated as a confirmed case “out of an abundance of caution.” The student was released after two weeks, which is the amount of time a tuberculosis patient is capable of spreading the disease to others.
“The feeling was, let’s treat this as TB, do the isolation until the two weeks of treatment, look at other close contacts with the person, and make sure there’s no symptoms in those people—there have not been—and treat it as an isolated case,” Barreira said.
Barreira added that while the acute treatment and self isolation during the two week infectious period has ended, the individual will continue to remain in treatment for many months afterward.
Barreira said he does not expect to see another case of tuberculosis at Harvard.
“Nobody else has symptoms, so I don’t expect to see another case of TB, and were it to happen, I think it would be for a different reason,” he said. “I wouldn’t think it to be related to this particular patient.”
Barreira has also said that he has not seen any cases of  E. coli at Harvard despite a recent outbreak linked to Chicken & Rice Guys food outlets.
The outbreak has affected 15 people in the greater Boston area. However, none of the cases were related to the food truck on Harvard’s campus, according to marketing manager Steven Collicelli.

Three Harvard professors were awarded prestigious Guggenheim research fellowships, an award honoring “exceptional creative ability in the arts,” last week.
Started in 1925, the Guggenheim Foundation awards fellowships each year to individuals who exhibit “exceptional capacity for productive scholarship” and contributions to artistic fields, according to the award’s website.
Of this year’s 173 scholarship recipients, Law School professor Adriaan Lanni, Drama, English, and Comparative Literature professor Martin Puchner, and Education School professor Natasha K. Warikoo will receive grants to assist their respective research projects spanning six to twelve months.
Lanni said she will use her fellowship to conduct research for her book “Crime and Justice in Democratic Athens.”
She wrote in an email that she hopes to explore what it means to have a truly “popular” justice system through her studies in ancient law. Her research will look at Athenian democracy in depth and compare it to modern legal frameworks. She plans to do archival research at Harvard in the spring of 2019.
Puchner said will use his Guggenheim grant to work on his book about Rotwelsch, a language that is “a strange mixture of German, Yiddish, and Hebrew.”
Puchner describes Rotwelsch as “the language of the underground, the language of the road, the language of hobos...of peddlers, of escaped convicts...used by the underground to communicate secretly with each other.”
The language, which he said few know about, was documented only because police officers for hundreds of years tried to decipher it.
Puchner said he plans to study extensive archives on the language he inherited from his uncle as well as conduct research in Germany and Central Europe. He said he will likely take a research leave the year after next.
Warikoo, whose work focuses on the intersection of race and education, said she plans to do ethnographic research at public schools for an upcoming book.
Warikoo said she looks forward to spending time speaking with suburban communities “that are experiencing change.”
She said she hopes to study a wealthy, suburban community with good schools and a large and growing Asian American population.
She said the question in these communities and public schools becomes whether ethnic groups undergo a process of assimilation “or are conceptions of success shifting through the kind of growing Asian American population, and how do these shifts shape kind of race relations among young people in the schools as well as in the community?”
Warikoo said she will likely to go on leave for the 2017-2018 school year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Senior Class Committee announced the four members of the graduating Class of 2017 who will be sharing the stage with former Vice President of the United States Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on May 24 for the College’s annual Class Day celebrations.
Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 and Bessie X. Zhang ’17 will deliver the Harvard orations at the festivities, and Rachel J. Stromberg ’17 and Declan P. Garvey ’17 will present the Ivy orations.
The Harvard orations are more formal graduation speeches, where speakers often reflect on their time at the College, while the Ivy orations provide seniors a chance to add humor to the proceedings. A male and female speaker are chosen for each style of speech.
The four orators will join Biden, who was announced Class Day speaker last week. They were selected by a subcommittee of the Senior Class Committee led by program marshals Avni Nahar ’17 and Victoria H. Jones ’17.
Out of all the applicants who submitted a speech to the subcommittee, Nahar—an inactive Crimson editor—said the group narrowed the field down to ten potential Harvard orators and ten potential Ivy orators before settling on the final four speakers.
“We had a really hard time picking the final four speeches—there were just so many that were truly, truly great,” Nahar said. “We think these four speakers will be an incredible complement in addition to Vice President Joe Biden’s remarks.”
Standing in Tercentenary Theatre a month ahead of Class Day, the speakers assembled on Monday to talk about the inspiration for their speeches and the messages they hope to impart to fellow seniors.
Roberts’ said his family has inspired his oration, which will focus on reconciling his Harvard experience with the larger world.
“I think we will leave here being very good at being successful automatons, but not necessarily great at sharing humanity and sharing community between one another,” Roberts said. “A lot of my speech talks about both the pain we experience here, the pain we often fail to confront here, but also, hopefully, instilling a sense of trust for the pain of others.”
Zhang said her speech will reflect some of the lessons she learned at the College.
“It’s a speech that responds to the expectations placed on us as Harvard graduates to be the ones always voicing our opinions and leading the way, and kind of hoping to take a step back from that,” Zhang said.
Garvey, a former Crimson editorial editor, previewed his Ivy oration by talking about the role of failure, especially the lack of it, that plays in experiences of students before and during their time at the College.
“I’m trying to find the humor in that we’re all graduating from Harvard, and by that measure of success, none of us are failing by any means,” Garvey said. “But, day to day, and relative to our peers here, there are always going to be places where we fall short.”
Reflecting on her time at Harvard, Stromberg said she intends to convey the sense of nostalgia that comes with graduation. True to the humorous style of Ivy orations, Stromberg also joked that she is planning on scrapping her original speech and writing a roast of Biden instead.
“My speech is mostly about conspiracy theories, so that’s what I’ll stick with,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2017 at 12:39 p.m.
Cheered on by supportive fans and motivated by inspirational signs, more than a dozen Harvard students joined thousands of other runners to cross the finish line of the 121st annual Boston Marathon.
Founded in 1897, the Boston Marathon is the oldest annual marathon in the world, and in recent years the event has taken on a larger significance for Bostonians. After the detonation of two bombs killed three near the finish line of the marathon in 2013, the marathon has become a symbol of Boston’s resilience. More than 30,000 people registered to run this year’s 26.2 mile race.
“Running is technically an individual sport but I’ve played on a lot of team sports growing up and this was definitely the biggest and most selfless team that I’ve ever been a part of,” said Mark E. Czeisler ’19. “I really fed off the crowd.”
Other Harvard students praised their friends’ support.
“So many of our friends came out to support and were on miles 24, 25, and 26 and that was the only way we got through it,” said Adrian E. Horton ’17, who ran the marathon with her sister to benefit the Joslin Diabetes Center. “The finish was like nothing I had ever experienced. It doesn’t feel real.”
Students also said they were proud of themselves for balancing their marathon training with heavy academic workloads.
“Training was a little complicated because I was training during the winter and writing a thesis,” said Horton. “I ran less miles per week but I made sure to hit the long run targets.”
Many Harvard students ran the marathon to fundraise for Boston-area charities. Sophie R. Barry ’20 chose to represent the Boston Children’s Hospital’s Miles for Miracles Team because she was a patient at the hospital as an infant.
“Nineteen years ago, I was hooked up to a ventilator because I couldn’t breathe and I just ran 26.2 miles,” she said. “At times when it was hard for me [during today’s marathon], I just thought about how there are kids going through much harder things.”
Other Harvard runners also said they chose to help causes they had personal experience with.
Manizha Kholmatov ’17 said she chose to benefit the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric Cancer Team because she had cancer when she was younger.
“This cause is really close to my heart,” she said. “It felt like a way to give back and also accomplish something.”
Czeisler, who ran to benefit the Martin Richard Foundation, an organization named after an eight-year-old victim of the Boston Marathon bombings, said it was especially meaningful to support this charity.
“That was as cool, if not cooler, than the actually running part...just meeting everyone and working with them to fundraise for such an important and such an inspiring cause,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students have launched a new effort urging Harvard to divest—this time taking aim at the University’s holdings in private prison stocks.
The new undergraduate-led initiative, called the Harvard College Project for Justice, disseminated a petition over some House lists last week calling for Harvard to divest from “direct and indirect investments in private prison stock, as well as publicly commit to a moratorium on such investments in the future.”
“These corporations profit off of immigrant detention as well as mass incarceration, and they lobby to perpetuate the expansion of these deeply unjust institutions,” the petition reads. “For those reasons, we petition Harvard to publicly denounce private prison investments.”
The email specifically referenced holdings the University had in Vanguard—one of the world’s largest investment firms—in fiscal year 2016, charging Harvard with holding tens of millions of dollars in what the group describes as a “fund that is notorious for private prison investments.”
In its fiscal year 2016 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission—which the group said it referenced before issuing its petition—Harvard reported that it possessed about $23 million worth of shares in the firm, though the breakdown of the firm’s investments is not publicly available.
According to Abigail N. Burke ’19, who co-founded the Project for Justice and launched a private prison divestment task force within the organization, said the group will deliver their petition to University President Drew G. Faust at the end of this week.
Burke pegged the petition to a commitment Faust made after the election to shield Harvard’s undocumented students from the anti-immigrant policies of President Donald Trump’s administration. Since Trump took office in January, immigration arrests across the country have risen and members of his administration have sharply criticized cities like Cambridge, which have declared a sort of sanctuary status for undocumented individuals.
Burke said Harvard’s continued investment in Vanguard seemed “a little hypocritical.”
Melodie L. Jackson, the University’s top spokesperson, declined to comment for this story.
As of Monday, the petition had garnered about 350 signatures, according to Burke, including a few faculty members.
Harvard is also facing divestment demands from an environmental activist group that has publicly protested the University’s former investments in the coal industry and current holdings in fossil fuel assets. The group, dubbed Divest Harvard, most recently led a day-long blockade of University Hall, a building in Harvard Yard that houses some of the University’s top administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. During the blockade, some administrators worked remotely in campus cafes.
At the time of the protest, the group demanded Harvard set a moratorium on any future coal investments. Burke said that while the prison divestment effort is not directly affiliated with Divest Harvard, they have received helpful information from the activist group for researching Harvard’s investments and preparing a petition.
Though as of Oct. 2016, Harvard was not invested in coal, it has publicly reserved the right to do so in the future. Faust has also repeatedly said that divestment is not the most effective way for Harvard to combat climate change.
In the event that the Task Force’s petition is met with a similar response by the University, Burke said the group would be content with a compromise.
“I think one thing in particular that we would probably insist on is that they not ever have any direct holdings in private prison companies,” Burke said. “I think it’s a little bit harder for the University to divest from mutual funds that have those holdings, but we would definitely ask them to commit to no direct investments, and maybe ask them to just denounce the industry as a whole.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life honored seven students and three student groups at the inaugural Student Leadership Recognition Awards ceremony in the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Monday.
The ceremony was commissioned by the OSL to recognize contributions of student leaders to campus life and student organizations that have demonstrated commitment to collaboration and innovation.
Dozens of students were nominated for the three individual award categories, and 11 student groups were candidates for the three organization awards. A selection committee of College administrators and UC representatives chose the winners.
Alexander R. Miller, the assistant dean of student life, said that the ceremony served to highlight the work that students have done on campus.
“I was reading the nominations and was truly surprised by all the things that our students are involved in and tonight was just a representation of all the things that our students have done,” Miller said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke at the ceremony and presented the awards to recipients. A Business School professor of leadership development himself, Khurana reflected on the distinction between being a leader and demonstrating leadership in his opening remarks.
Shaiba Rather ’17, former Undergraduate Council President, received the signature prize called the “Veritas Award” and gave the keynote speech for the evening.
“I was elected to serve as UC President but more than anything it was nice to see all these unsung heroes be recognized today,” Rather said. “I feel truly honored to be recognized but everything I have accomplished on this campus has had at least 50 people working behind it so the leadership I have been awarded for was not just me but the actions of many people.”
Harvard College VISION President Paul M. Lewis ’18 said that he appreciated his organization’s selection for the “Collaboration Award” and enjoyed the focus of the ceremony on recognizing students.
“We were very happy to win the award and very grateful for all the groups we work with,” Lewis said. “We try and see it as not just as winning the award, but also the groups that have helped us achieve this.”
The student leadership awards is part of the OSL’s “leadership development” initiative launched earlier this semester, which also included a grant incentivizing student organizations to host events together and a leadership workshop called “Catalyst.” Grant funding was awarded to 22 individual students and 26 student organizations, according to the OSL’s website.
The Freshman Dean’s Office created their own set of awards in 2016 to recognize achievements beyond the classroom and will present the five awards to freshmen at a ceremony on May 3.
A complete list of Student Leadership Awards winners is below:
Inclusive Community Award: Cabot Café
Collaboration Award: VISION
Innovation Award: Music in Hospitals and Nursing Homes Using Entertainment as Therapy
Emerging Leader Award: Hakeem O. I.  Angulu ’20, Alisha A. Ukani ’20, and Henry Zhu ’20
Spirit of Harvard College Award: Berkeley Brown ’18, Anwar Omeish ’19, and Raj Vatsa ’18
Veritas Award: Shaiba Rather ’17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coaches of men’s athletic teams at Harvard make significantly more money than coaches of women’s teams, a disparity the Athletics Department is considering as part of a review of  how it compensates its coaching staff.
A database from the Department of Education that compiled statistics from the 2015-2016 school year shows that the Harvard Athletics Department pours its resources overwhelmingly into men’s programs.
Head coaches of Harvard’s women’s teams made roughly $34,000 less  on average than the head coaches of  men’s teams. In 2015-2016, head coaches of men’s teams made $114,196, and head coaches of women’s teams made $80,097. Assistant coaches for women’s sports also make less than their colleagues on men’s teams, earning $39,006 compared to $53,983 for assistant coaches on men’s teams. The way Harvard pays its coaches is consistent with statistics from across the Ivy League.
These compensation differences play out along gender lines. The head coach of every men’s team at Harvard is male, and only eight women coach a men’s team in any capacity. Half of women’s team’s head coaches are men, and 23 of 45 assistant coach positions for women’s teams are held by men.
Athletics Department spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson wrote in a statement Monday evening that the Athletics Department “periodically” reviews how it compensates the coaches of men and women’s teams.
“We have historically considered the market along with a variety of factors in setting salaries,” Williamson wrote. “We are taking a hard look at our criteria and will continue to make appropriate adjustments.”

In an interview earlier this month, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith—who oversees the Athletics Department—said that an investigation into gender equity in athletics beyond the normal procedure was underway.
“For a variety of reasons that I don’t want to go into, there’s reasons it’s being looked at in more detail today,” Smith said.
The Athletics Department is also conducting a broad review of the program’s culture after a number of highly-publicized incidents last year prompted concerns about gender equality in the department.
Under Title IX, Harvard is required to provide equal opportunities for and treatment of male and female student-athletes, including providing equal facilities, equipment, opportunities to play, and support and recruitment services. But the reality, some experts say, can often be more complicated.
“[The law] gave women a lot of opportunities to play sports, but this doesn’t apply for employment,” said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic gold medalist and civil rights lawyer, in an interview.
With its 42 varsity teams, Harvard has the most NCAA Division I varsity sports programs in the country and the third highest number of student-athletes among the Ivy League with 1,070 participants—roughly 16 percent of the student body— in the department’s programs, according to Department of Education data. The majority of these athletes are men; during the 2015-2016 academic year, there were 629 male athletes at Harvard and 441 female athletes, according to the Department of Education.
In 2015-2016, the Athletics Department put $11,523,987 towards men’s teams and $7,361,857 towards women’s teams, according to the Department of Education’s database. Of the listed expenses, men’s teams spent $815,274 on recruiting, nearly half a million more than the women’s teams, which spent $327,342 last year.
While Harvard offers an equal number of men’s and women’s teams, the ratio of male to female athletes is considerably higher than the ratio of male to female students. While 47 percent of the student body is female, only about 41 percent of student-athletes are female, a difference which some say points to larger inequities.
Hogshead-Makar said if the difference between the number of male athletes and female athletes exceeds the size of a standard athletic team, a school may be violating federal law.
“A gap of 25 or more athletes will not equate to compliance with proportionality,” Hogshead-Makar wrote in an email.
Other experts, though, say that both Harvard’s larger number of male athletes and coaches is relatively common.
“There has never been a university that has lost federal funding because they have not been in compliance with Title IX, but you could make the argument that most schools aren’t completely in compliance,” said University of Connecticut professor Laura J. Burton.
Nicole LaVoi, a professor at the University of Minnesota and the co-director of the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport, said that more men have started coaching women’s teams as it has become more lucrative nationwide.
“Back in the seventies, these women that were mostly coaching women either didn’t get paid at all or got paid very little so men weren’t interested in that,” LaVoi said. “But now if you’re a women’s basketball coach at the highest level, you could make half a million dollars or more.”
Burton also attributed the lower number of female athletics administrators and female coaches, especially of men’s teams, to biases in the hiring processes.
“When you have your higher profile, revenue generating sport, you are going to select that person who better represents leadership and expertise,” said Burton. “Unfortunately we stereotype that person to be more masculine than feminine.”

Picture this. It’s a beautiful Monday afternoon. You’re outside at a darty, living it up with some of your closest friends and some new friends from other schools. Everyone is in a great mood, and you can finally imagine what it feels like to attend a school that’s actually fun.
Now, imagine that you’re sitting in class and seeing all of your friends from other Boston schools living this life through their endless snap stories. This is how Harvard students feel every year on Patriots’ Day. As the only school that doesn’t get Marathon Monday off as a holiday, Harvard seems very committed to not letting its students have nice things. But we’re not here to make you feel better about that. To add insult to injury, here’s a list of other nice things that Harvard just won’t let us have.
Places to Use Our BoardPlus
We, too, are feeling bitter about the replacement of Greenhouse with Clover. Harvard clearly wants us to enjoy a trek to Northwest every day for lunch. The amount of BoardPlus Harvard gives us is inversely related to the amount of places we can use it. Makes a lot of sense.
A Real Social Scene
Now, we’ll never reach state school levels, but you never quite get over the harsh reality of Harvard social life as your third dorm party of the night gets shut down.
An End to Midterm Season
Midterm season started about three weeks into the semester. But now we have a question. How is it still a midterm if it’s the last week of school? That’s a final. Any exams after the second week of April that aren’t finals are rude and disrespectful. Which is apparently exactly on brand for Harvard.
School Spirit
I’m sure you thought that coming to college would mean huge tailgates and parties for all the sporting events. Try to find someone who attended a football game other than Harvard-Yale. And if that someone is on the football team, that doesn’t count. Nice try.
A Yardfest Artist
This one is particularly rough. At this point, we think everyone would even be happy with an artist from our middle school years (#MetroStationforYardfest2017). But we don’t even have that. This is only made worse by the fact that our dear neighbor to the south, Brown, has Young Thug and Erykah Badu.

Well it sure took them long enough.
With three days to spare, the College Events Board has decided to grace us with the name of this year’s Yardfest headliner: Tiësto.
It seems like every year the CEB does the same song and dance, making us wait till the very last possible second to learn the name of the Yardfest pick. There’s been more than enough build up; this year, a spat broke out on Facebook between two camps of students, one pulling for Carly Rae Jepsen to headline the concert and the other hoping the Chainsmokers would take the spot.
We understand—and would, under any other circumstance, appreciate—their love of suspense, but enough is enough.
Anyway, the choice of Tiësto as this year’s performer is sure to inspire mixed reactions considering his chosen genre of music. Electronic dance music—as sick as some of its beats may be—is often considered to be ill-suited for concerts because the artist doesn’t actually sing live, but rather plays pre-designed mixes. It’s definitely less enjoyable watching someone pushing buttons on a stage for a few hours—even if there’s cake and booze involved. That didn’t stop some folks from getting lit last year when Steve Aoki smashed through campus, and hopefully Tiesto, who's been crowned the "Greatest DJ of All Time" by MixMag Magazine, won't disappoint.
Mixed feelings aside, it’s nice to know that yes, Yardfest is happening, and no, Dean Khurana will not be DJing.
Here’s a rundown of the artists performing at other Ivy-League spring concerts in case you’re thinking of skipping town for a few days and partying it up somewhere else (note that many of these schools announced their performers many months in advance):
