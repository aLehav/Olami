After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you think Harvard is a revolutionary communist hotbed, don’t apply. If you think Harvard is full of “pinheaded” professors, don’t enroll. And if you think Harvard pollutes the minds of its students, don’t walk out of here with a degree—and certainly don’t get two.
You see, lately, there seems to be a pernicious trend of public figures—especially those on the right—falling in love with Harvard just long enough to benefit from its educational resources and, yes, its social prestige, before turning against our school. Just recently, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas affirmed his belief that Harvard Law School was, during his years as a student there, home to a cohort of “Marxists who believed in…overthrowing the United States government.” In November, Fox News pundit and Harvard Kennedy School graduate Bill O’Reilly glibly referred to Harvard professors as “pinheaded” while implying that the Harvard community is morally suspect for its acceptance of Harvard College Munch, a group for students who share an interest in kinky sex. And last April, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who holds a J.D. and MBA from our fine institution, lambasted President Obama for having spent “too much time at Harvard.”
Such episodes of treachery are apparently attempts to curry favor with the more anti-intellectual members of our body politic. Yet it is finally time that we say enough is enough. We at The Crimson urge anyone who plans on one day scoring political points by maligning Harvard to neither apply, enroll, nor graduate from this fine institution.
If only we could have spoken to a young, wide-eyed Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, or Bill O’Reilly. We would have assured them that it was okay to be anti-intellectual, and that millions of people around the world do it every day. Although we didn’t share their dread of academia, we would have tried to make them feel comfortable with the lifestyle they were preparing to lead. We would have attempted either to disabuse them of whatever cognitively dissonant impulses gave them the urge to attend Harvard or, at the very least, try to prepare them for the potentially scary environment that awaited them. For one, we would warn them that Harvard has a few liberals. While they may seem strange and foreign to a young conservative, they are almost certainly not secret communists and probably actually less of a threat to the integrity of the United States government than some people back home. Second, we would warn them that education gives people new ideas that they might not have otherwise had. This may make them seem “pinheaded,” or it may even change them a bit, as Mr. Romney suggested about President Obama. But it probably doesn’t make them stupid.
If we could have spoken to these three young men, we could have spared them from the fear and anguish that must come part-and-parcel with seeing oneself as instructed by insurrectionists or buffoons. If we could have spoken to these three men, we would have told them never to come to Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I graduated from Harvard College in December, just in time to start work at a state psychiatric hospital in my home state of South Carolina. South Carolina has endured the deepest budget cuts to mental health of any state in the United States over the past four years, and the hospital where I work has more empty beds than filled ones. We have three psychiatrists for the whole hospital—and one of them is quitting next week. There is a long waiting list of severely mentally ill people who need treatment we may not be able to provide, simply because we do not have the resources to do so.
It is in the context of my new job that I have been hearing about the surging interest among Harvard students in demanding reform of University Mental Health Services. As someone who received a significant amount of mental health treatment at University Health Services and as someone who spent much time advocating for mental health during my time at Harvard, I want to offer my brief perspective.
As anyone who knows me can confirm, I am beyond thrilled at the attention mental health is receiving around the country, despite the etiology of that attention. While at Harvard, I was deeply involved in bringing attention to the mental health services available on campus. I am glad to see that Harvard students have turned their energies to mental health in a new and forceful way. Yet, I believe that students at Harvard need a reality check on the relative quality of services to which they have access.
According to a clinician at UHS, there is so much demand for mental health on Harvard’s campus, that even if UHS doubled the size of MHS tomorrow, there still would not be enough resources to go around. This is absolutely unacceptable. This should simply not be the case at one of the best universities in the country. It is especially worrisome because Harvard College is a residential community, and many students expect to have all their healthcare needs met within that community. Of course, this sets Harvard apart from many other colleges in the country, where students must look outside the university setting and navigate the local community in finding the healthcare resources they need.
There are also, as has been mentioned numerous times, undue complexities in the relationship between the College and UHS for students who want to receive mental health services on campus without interrupting their studies. I encountered these problems repeatedly in my time at Harvard.  I didn’t know whether I should consider my resident dean a confidante or an agent of the Ad Board. At one point, after taking a medical leave, I was notified two days before I had been planning to return to campus that the Ad Board had denied my application for readmission. I could go on. The bureaucratic complexities of Harvard make things harder than they have to be on students dealing with major mental health issues. This is something that certainly needs to be addressed.
At the end of the day, though, I am thankful that UHS was there for me when I needed it. I was able to receive extended treatment at McLean Hospital, a Harvard affiliate that is consistently ranked one of the best psychiatric hospital in the country. Although the first therapist I saw at UHS seemed to be falling asleep on me, I found other clinicians who gave the highest quality care I can imagine. It is impossible to know, of course, but I am not sure I would still be alive today if it hadn’t for the mental health treatment I received at Harvard.
This level of care is not available in most locations: It wasn’t for me when I was away from the College. A two-day hospitalization in South Carolina cost me many thousands of dollars and provided me with nothing but memories of unsympathetic and unprofessional staff members cursing at annoying patients. I was lucky even to get in. At this moment, there are people waiting for beds, many in local emergency rooms, to free up in the hospital where I work, even though over half the beds are empty due to a dual lack of funds and psychiatrists. In total contrast, a Harvard student can walk in to UHS at any time, 24/7, and see someone immediately. If the issue is one of suicidality or psychosis, or is immediately dangerous, then that student can be admitted quickly and efficiently to a nearby hospital, most likely McLean.
I realize many have different perspectives on this issue. I know that there is much that can be improved at Harvard on the mental health front. But when protesting and criticizing Harvard mental health services, we should remember simultaneously that, believe it or not, we have access to some of the highest quality mental health services in the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My political background seems pretty typical of a Harvard student. I grew up in a household full of liberals. In high school, I joined the Young Democrats club and volunteered for the campaigns of several local Democratic politicians. And when it came time for me to vote this past year, I proudly cast my ballot for President Obama. I have always considered myself a Democrat, and a liberal one at that. That is, until I got to Harvard. Here, I have somehow been made to feel like a conservative.
It is not something that happened right away. I stepped onto campus in the fall excited to get involved in what I expected would be a vibrant liberal political environment. I attended a few meetings of the Harvard College Democrats and often engaged in political discussions with my peers in informal settings. When a friend chided me for being unaware of the concept of Preferred Gender Pronouns, however, I began to realize that the liberals of Harvard were much further to the left than I had ever imagined.  Now more than a semester into my time here, it seems clear to me that the political left at Harvard operates almost exclusively on the fringes of liberalism.
Rather than focusing on the ongoing budget negations and the economic health of our nation, the liberals of Harvard spend their political capital vilifying oil companies through the divestment movement and obsessing over political correctness. With much of the Harvard community, let alone the general population, still unaware of the existence of PGPs, liberal student groups here are pushing for their institutionalization. The focus on these far-left issues has left me, and other mainstream Democrats, feeling disillusioned about the state of Democratic politics at Harvard.
Furthermore, this radical approach is damaging to the very causes these students are trying to promote. Fixating on PGPs, for example, detracts from the broader push for transgender acceptance and equality. It trivializes the important issues at stake. We should work towards making substantive gains in areas such as marriage equality and combatting discrimination before focusing on issues of semantics. To say we need a shift in focus is not to belittle the ideas behind the concept of PGPs; it is only to suggest that taking such radical stances on these issues is not a winning strategy.
Besides losing the support and participation of moderates, the ruling liberals of this campus are missing an opportunity by moving so far to the left. At a time when the Republican Party has moved so far to the right that some pundits, such as the New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, believe it is on the verge of extinction, we have the chance to show the rationality of Democratic politics. We need to buck the “idealistic liberal” stereotype and bring common sense to the political arena by presenting reasonable solutions to the core economic and social problems of the average American. In this way, we can keep the far right from even coming close to implementing its reckless economic policies and intolerant social agenda.
While college is undoubtedly the time to push the boundaries of our political ideologies, the expressions of radical leftism on this campus hinder the achievement of the mainstream democratic agenda.  If we continue to move further and further left, we bring the radical right back into play. So long as we are as far to the left as they are to the right, the American people, who are on average moderately conservative, are left with no clear choice.
And while Harvard students obviously do not dictate the current platform of the Democratic Party or even the platform of the national liberal movement, we will assuredly play a role in forming such platforms in the future. Outside observers rightfully regard Harvard as a bastion of liberalism, and the behavior of our students gets more than its fair share of media attention. We cannot dismiss the fact that the focus and tone of our discourse matter.
Harvard students have long been known for their liberalism—and perhaps I should have been less surprised than I was by the extremity of it—but that does not mean we cannot also be known for our pragmatism. There is nothing wrong with having lofty progressive goals and passion about social justice, but it is important to understand the current political atmosphere. As liberals, we need to return our focus to the issues that people outside the walls of Harvard care about—the issues we can push while the Republican Party remains weak. We need to leave the radicalism to the right and work to win on the mainstream issues before we contemplate the frontiers of liberalism.

To the editor:
The editorial “An Unexploited Union” misrepresents the contract negotiations between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the University, and it unfairly blames the union for the stall in negotiations.
The editorial misleads readers about the dispute over wages. While HUCTW workers are paid above-average rates for their industry, considering that the Harvard University library system is one of the largest and most prestigious in the world, and considering that many librarians have master’s degrees and Ph.D’s, HUCTW’s pay scales are hardly laudable. In 2011, the lowest pay grade began at only $15.09 an hour, barely above the living wage for the city of Cambridge.
The editorial also fails to mention the largest conflict in the negotiations so far—healthcare. HUCTW has proposed a cost-neutral progressive health care plan, yet the University continues to argue against these practices even though they benefit both workers and the financial health of the university.
It is true that these negotiations have gone on for far too long; months after the previous contract expired, three mediators have had to assist in the contract negotiations. Yet Harvard, not HUCTW, ought to be blamed for this impasse, for it has been unwilling to compromise on wages and healthcare.
Last week, the Cambridge City Council passed a resolution in support of HUCTW stating, “Negotiations that ensure a consistent salary increase program and affordable healthcare solutions for union employees are essential for the sustenance of Cambridge’s local economy, community, and employees therein.” Indeed, even the Crimson supported higher wages for HUCTW just this past October. And today, HUCTW members, students, and community supporters—including U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano—will rally at 5 p.m. in Memorial Church for a fair contract.
The Crimson’s editorial presents an uncritical perspective on the contract negotiation process and needlessly maligns a union that is fighting for decent wages, affordable healthcare, and workplace dignity for its over 4,600 members.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, more than 160,000 Americans died from lung cancer. It was the leading cause of cancerous deaths, and is expected to only increase in both prevalence and incidence over the coming years. Yet ask the average American what he thinks the most common type of cancer is, and lung cancer does not immediately cross his mind. Especially in recent years, propaganda surrounding lung cancer awareness has been stingy; I only learned that November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month—or that lung cancer even had an awareness month—this past year, after a friend’s recommendation to read a New York Times blog on the subject. What’s most ironic is that when lung cancer began to exceed breast cancer as the leading cancerous killer amongst women, awareness of the disease started to steadily decrease.
Why do we forget such a dangerously persistent killer? Or perhaps a better question would be, is our ignorance by choice? These questions are difficult to answer because they force us to question our moral standing. There’s no denying that given its startling statistics, lung cancer should be recognized first and foremost as an extremely deadly medical disease. But instead of objectively seeing lung cancer for what it is, we form prejudices against the patients of lung cancer and blame them for their circumstances. Thus, we do not sympathize with them as much as we do with victims of the more “attractive” cancers. This in turn affects how much we are willing to help raise awareness to find a cure.
A few decades back, smoking (and thus lung cancer) used to be on everyone’s minds. The 1970s coalitions against cigarette smoking helped increase lung cancer awareness. But since then, the flame has burned out—almost leaving the impression that lung cancer was conquered, and it was time to tackle the next leading cancerous killer. The stigma associated with lung cancer, perhaps generated from media depictions of it as an unattractive disease, could account for why people prefer not to talk about it. Breast cancer, which has the highest funding amongst cancers, generates an image of solidarity and a “sisterhood” amongst survivors—a stark contrast from the imagery associated with lung cancer. Asking for donations for lung cancer research is much more difficult when lung cancer is considered an “ugly” disease.
These donations play on a person’s ethics: How likely is someone to donate to a cause that helps treat people who might be responsible for their own predicament? Inheritance accounts for only 1.7 percent of lung cancers; the rest of the diagnoses result from smoking (which alone accounts for a staggering 80 percent of lung cancer deaths), second-hand smoke, or work conditions. Even government spending on lung cancer is conservative—in 2008, the National Cancer Institute granted almost $13.5 thousand per breast cancer death and only $1.5 thousand per death for lung cancer.
There are other issues working against coalitions to save lung cancer patients besides this subtle “holier than thou” perspective. One such issue is how hopelessly deadly the disease is. While more “popular” cancers like breast cancer can rely on survivors to inspire hope, lung cancer is so deadly that survival is scarce. It has a 16 percent five-year survival rate as opposed to breast cancer’s 90 percent. Trying to find a sustainable cure for such a lethal disease seems futile. Why not donate to causes that might actually make a difference, the reasoning goes. This attitude solidifies the pessimistic image surrounding lung cancer, which in turn affects how media chooses to depict lung cancer and prolongs the never-ending cycle of continuous ignorance against the disease.
Focusing on why people are diagnosed with lung cancer deters people from realizing the sheer severity of this disease. Instead, we need to focus our attention on the facts: Lung cancer is the leading cancerous death in America, its prevalence has steadily increased and is estimated to increase even more in the coming years, and it receives much less government funding than would be expected for such a dangerous disease. After absorbing these facts, we need to take action. More money needs to go into researching early detection strategies, many of which have already proven to be very promising.
Considering how far science has come in understanding cancer and potentially finding a cure, one would hope our attitudes towards lung cancer would also advance to a less critical perspective. But our prejudices against the disease are still alarmingly backwards. This might not necessarily be our fault—the way media depicts the disease tends to influence how we view it—but that does not mean we should continue what is clearly morally wrong discrimination against people with lung cancer. Let’s make the effort to “race for a cure” for this deadly disease so we can finally breath a sigh of relief that its on its way towards eradication.

On February 20. British comedian and self identified executive transvestite Eddie Izzard spoke at Harvard’s Memorial Church to accept the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism presented by The HSS Cultural Humanism committee at Harvard. Dressed in his signature drag as he sits with me after the event, Izzard sips a glass of wine and cracks open pistachios with long fingernails painted a bright shade of red. A couple of designs on his nails stand out.
1. Fifteen Minutes: I see that two of your nails aren’t red. What’s the story behind those? 
 Eddie Izzard: That’s the British flag, and that’s the European flag. So I’m a British-European transvestite.
 
2. FM: That’s a lot of European pride.
EI: Yeah. That’s a political statement. It displays my sexuality and political alignment, and I like it because it’s girly, but it’s also political. So it’s tough-edged, girly, and very shiny and sparkly.
3. FM: Do you have any big future plans? I hear the papacy is vacant.
EI: I’m running for mayor of London, so that’s a big enough plan.
4. FM: What made you decide to run?
EI: I felt like I could be political, and if I wasn’t doing entertainment, I would do politics. Which is slightly bonkers, since I like the entertainment industry and politics looks tougher. But, I thought because the Nazis and fascists keep coming back and keep bringing racism and xenophobia and putting that forward, I felt I should go in. I have a certain amount of energy and new ideas, and I think I should put that into the mix. I should do at least one election and see what happens to see what I can do. Sometimes you have to stand up and be counted.
5. FM: Do you think being a comedian prepared you in any way for politics? 
EI:  Politics can be very dry, so if you could make a serious speech and make it a little lighthearted, I’m sure people will be thankful for that. And it gives you a certain confidence when talking to people. Just like Al Franken’s gone in, I’m going in. I think Al’s one of the first comedians in the world to go in like this. But I planned it for some time, and I realized Al was doing it. Hopefully I will get to a place where Al is.
6. FM: George Carlin once said that the role of the comedian is to find where the line is drawn and then cross it. In your mind, what is the role?
EI: I think that’s fine for George—I can totally understand what George is saying. I think it’s to entertain in the most beautiful way you know how—to juxtapose ideas in a new way. If you can inform at the same time, then it’s a bonus, but it’s just entertainment. Find the line, and then crossing it that’s interesting. I don’t see that as my main thing. I’m not necessarily trying to cross lines—I do, but it’s not my main drive.  If I can point out something without crossing a line, like: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” I was reading about that and saw it was the Golden Rule, and it’s in Christianity, and it’s in Judaism, and it’s in Islam, and it’s in Hindu faith. It’s in all of them, fucking hell. That’s not crossing the line, that’s just saying treat other people as you’d like to be treated yourself. I think that’s the only thing in religion you need. You don’t need the prayers, the fig, the body of Christ, the thing with the hammer—any of that shit, forget it all. Just treat people as you’d like to be treated. Now that gets rid of a whole load of religious paraphernalia, but I think it’s true. That’s all you bloody need.
7. FM: I’m also aware that you were in some hot water a few years ago for recycling jokes. Do you think there’s an unfair expectation of comedians to come up with new material? 
EI: Before 1990 Britain, there was this thing where you just get a certain amount of material and then you just do it forever. Like the Rolling Stones: They put a certain amount of songs together and added some too, but they still play “I Can’t Get No Satisfaction,” and this is 50 years since they couldn’t get any satisfaction. They still can’t get any satisfaction, and they’re repeating the song. So that’s what comedy used to be like, and I was part of the group that started changing over to doing the stuff quicker. But it is better for comedy to be turned over. I was just caught because they said I’m not turning it over, and I said, “Yes, that’s my style, I don’t turn it over.” I actually start up with the old material and gradually roll it over. That is my technique, and I told everyone about it. But they didn’t realize I told everyone about it so they complained. Kind of stupid.
8. FM: Does being back on a college campus bring back any memories from your admittedly short stay in college—or university as you guys call it overseas?
EI: Yeah. It does in a way—it makes me think of Oxford and Cambridge because you have Yale and Harvard here. I was walking around here in 2008—I was walking past this very church, and I was standing outside of it, which is kind of weird to come back here and do a talk inside. It does [bring back memories]—I probably could be a better student now. I wasn’t such a great student then. I did very little work and then I pulled out, then I hung around for four years, so I had quite a good time doing shows and not really doing work. But it was the beginning of what I am now, because I put in a lot of energy into doing things and making things. They just weren’t very good things.
9. FM: Do you have any favorite stand-up comedians?
EI: In America, I think Patton Oswalt is great. God, who are the other people—I always think out of my head. Zach Galifianakis when he was doing his stuff was very weird and crazy. Robin Williams of course. His stuff was happening and I was just getting my thing going and his was there. There’s a lot of really good American stuff.
10. FM: Like most of those comics, you do a lot of acting on the side. But if someone were to play you in a movie, who would it be? 
EI: Well it would have to be an actress...I don’t think it’s for me to answer. Or else Keira Knightley.

The signs started appearing in 2009, at the height of the recession: Bright blue letters on yellow corrugated plastic, nearly indistinguishable from the thousands of others offering liquidity solutions to the desperate. They were stapled to telephone poles and planted upright in lawns. But these signs weren’t soliciting the sale of junk cars or forclosed homes. Instead, they offered “CA$H for your WARHOL.”
At first, the 617 phone number listed as a “24-hr message service” was just a cell phone number belonging to Geoff L. Hargadon ’76. When calls started pouring in, however, Hargadon began using a Google Voice account to record the messages.
Responses ranged from the apparently sincere (“I don’t have a Warhol, but I have…a [Alexander] Calder and a Peter Alexander I want to get rid of”) to the outraged (“You’re vandalizing the Back Bay…. You don’t really want my Warhols! Do you really want my Warhols?”). One caller even dubbed Hargadon’s work “The best propaganda I’ve seen in years.” Another left a message describing the three “beautiful” warthogs he had for sale, including one with an eye problem. The Philadelphia Police called to complain about the placement of a sign. Some of the calls even came from art galleries and “people who should know better,” in Hargadon’s words.
The posters, however, were intended as a joke. “I thought it would be a good send up to the one percent. At that point in the financial crisis, everybody was in it, and even people who had Warhols were looking for bailout money,” says Hargadon.
Hargadon was surprised, however, by the immediate and overwhelming reactions to his signs. “I thought it would be sort of an obvious prank,” he says. “But it was amazing how many people would call me offering Warhols.” Some people even sent in photographs, using an online form on the project’s website, of Warhols of varying quality and authenticity: cheap posters, unsigned multiples, and even a painting that Hargadon estimates to be worth $500,000.
Today, Hargadon has compiled over 2,000 phone responses to his signs into a digital archive. He plays them from a widescreen iMac in the lofted studio space he calls “the laboratory” on the top floor of his Somerville home. Hargadon, who works in wealth management, calls art his “jeans-and-sneakers avocation.” When he shows me around his studio, however, he is wearing an immaculate button-up shirt, slacks, and shiny leather Oxfords.
Hargadon is tall and thin, with neatly cropped grey hair and blue eyes. At Harvard, he was an economics concentrator and lived in Kirkland House. Art “wasn’t even on the radar screen” for him in college, he says. Around 20 years ago, though, he had a “eureka moment” at an exhibition of work by Minimalist master Sol LeWitt. Hargadon subsequently fell in love with street art, and began collecting work by artists like PIXNIT, Swoon, Bäst, and the Brooklyn-based duo FAILE.
In 2005, Hargadon caught the attention of the art world with a parody of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s “The Gates,” a temporary installation of bright orange nylon arches that lined the pathways of New York’s Central Park in winter 2005. Hargadon’s “The Somerville Gates” was a miniaturized version that snaked through the doorways of his home and past his cat, Edie. “The Somerville Gates,” which was originally promoted solely via email to 30 friends, went viral and wound up three days later on the front page of The New York Times Arts Section.
Hargadon’s work, from doll-sized gates to Warholian sale signs, always picks fun at the overlap of art and commerce. The “Ca$h For Your Warhol” signs themselves, most of which are manufactured by Bandit Signs in Oklahoma, now sell for up to nearly $1,000. “I’m not really a skilled artist,” Hargadon readily admits. “I’m more of a conceptual artist—which sounds really pretentious, but I mean it literally: I’m dealing with concepts.” He continues, “I’m kind of relying on the skills of other people, but that’s okay because everyone’s doing that these days.”
Hargadon’s project caught the attention of other artists, like Jenny Holzer, whose conceptual work also deals heavily with text, and Shepard Fairey, best known for his iconic tri-tone Obama poster, whom Hargadon considers a friend. The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, an organization that promotes the arts in accordance with Warhol’s will, even commissioned a set of signs for its board members—photographer Cindy Sherman was among them.
But Hargadon pays close attention not only to his admirers but also to his critics. One street artist, Hargadon remembers, called him a “yuppie rich boy douchebag.” Hargadon’s response? “I may be a yuppie, and I may be a douchebag, but I’m definitely not rich,” he says, laughing.
In general, though, Hargadon says he gets along with street artists, despite differences in artistic project and public persona. “I visit with them, and I have good friendships with a lot of them and I think there’s mutual respect,” Hargadon explains.
Hargadon’s art is about provocation, not gratification. “I think art that tries to please all people ends up failing,” he says. “Some of them probably think it’s ridiculous, what I do, and that’s okay.”

When I call my brother to say that I’m thinking of writing about him in the magazine, he tells me he’s in Vail for the weekend with his new girlfriend. They rented skis and are staying in a small cabin; it’s cold, really cold. I explain to him how this Endpaper thing works—that I have a page to write just about anything—and that I’m thinking he might feature prominently.
“So it’s gonna be a page all about me?” Owen asks. “Sounds pretty sweet.” Then he promptly drops his phone in the snow. After a few muffled seconds: “Baxter, you there?”
*****
To my brother, I am no longer Rebecca. She left a handful of years ago (neither one of us remembers precisely when) to be replaced with Baxter: her slightly more eccentric, playful counterpart. It happened over a dinner conversation—one of those weeknight family affairs in our yellow-walled Manhattan apartment. Maybe we had just returned home sweaty and mud-stained from soccer practice, or else had been working on homework through the early evening. It may have been fajita night. Most of the details aren’t important, though. Except for these: Owen called me Baxter, I told him no—that it sounded more like a dog’s name than a person’s—he laughed, and the name stuck.
It began like just like that, as a way for Owen to annoy his older sister. To get back at her for all the years when her three-years-older self was able to pin him to the living room carpet and tickle him ’till he begged for mercy. But the title soon grew more serious. The nickname was catchy; even I didn’t deny that. My dad began to adopt it, and within a few months Owen had ceased calling me anything else. Baxter has a certain ring to it.
However, I generally stayed away from broadcasting the name. I suppose I viewed it in a similar way as I viewed the baby photos sprinkled around my house: mostly embarrassing, and somewhat endearing in the right context. Baxter was alright for family, but that was about it. As its usage became more commonplace, though, I would occasionally tell my friends about Baxter—bring it up as an entertaining family anecdote over dinner—and a silly grin would break out over their faces as they promised that they would never be able to keep a straight face if they ever actually heard me called Baxter.
I’ve asked my brother to explain the name’s origins to me a few times before, a request that always makes him smile. He eagerly obliges. The evolution went like this: Rebecca—Becca—Bec—Bax—Baxt—Baxter. “It makes total sense,” he always explains. “Also, it just sounds so much better. Baxt-er,” he will say slowly, emphasizing the twang in the first syllable.
For Owen, Baxter has moved from the realm of nickname to that of name. It is the identity he created for me, and it is one that I have grown into over the years.
Owen graduated last June, and it was an extravagant outdoor affair on the dew-damp grass of his Bronx high school’s football field. There were speeches and roses pinned to lapels, boys looking uncomfortable when their grandmothers kissed them on the head, girls beaming as their too-tall heels sunk into the mud.
I was on camera duty at the time, entrusted to obediently follow Owen around and take photos of him alongside friends and teachers. As we wandered, classmate after classmate approached us, gave Owen a congratulatory hug, and then turned to me with small upturned smiles. Their eyes lit up: “Is this Baxter?”
The first few times this happened, I reached out for a handshake and said, “Hi, I’m Rebecca.” I wished to correct them as unobtrusively as possible. But eventually I realized that in Owen’s world, Rebecca no longer exists. So I gave up and just began saying, “Yep, nice to meet you.”
It was my way of saying: Okay Owen, you won.

“Anything else you want me to add?” I ask. Owen tells me no, so I ask how Vail is going, if he’s gotten to the double black diamonds yet. He chuckles as he describes more questionably accurate details of his whereabouts. (Owen cannot afford to fly himself to Vail, and has never introduced me to a girlfriend.) The snow does crunch around him though, and Owen’s gloved hand continues to struggle maintaining its grip on the phone.
“Call back any time if there’s a need for an interview,” he notes before I hang up. “I’m here all day.”

Kirkland House roommates Kathleen J. Koenigs ’15 and Nosipho D. “Dichaba” McGinty ’15 met across their freshman fire door. Their friendship is a testament to the fact that, though mostly utilized for eavesdropping, a thin fire door occasionally provides more than just fodder for resentment—it can be the key to finding a best friend.
KATHLEEN:
“My friends from home and I made videos of our first week at college, and I was holding my laptop out walking around my room giving a tour. I have a super loud and bubbly voice. And so I guess I was super loud and I said, “Oh, look at this—we have a window and this is our bathroom and this is our sink!” I didn’t realize that the people next door could hear me the entire time. Later we had a Straus mixer where we got to meet people in the dorm. Apparently the people next door recognized my voice. We went down the line and said ‘Hi’ and they said to each other ‘Oh, that’s that girl!’ and apparently they thought I was super obnoxious and they were really put off. But then we met and we clicked right away. It was an immediate thing. From then on I basically stopped living in my own room. We actually tried to petition to get the fire door opened so I could just go straight across, but they said that wasn’t allowed. So instead I would go down all four flights of stairs across and up four flights of stairs. I probably spent about 75 percent of my time there.I remember it was my birthday, which is in October, so we were already really close at that point. It was midnight and they blindfolded me and sang happy birthday. I was so happy because no one had ever done that for me before. So I just came out with it and said ‘You know what? I think we should block together.’ It’s been great living with her. We get to share clothes, we get to share makeup and jewelry. We just live very well together, which is very lucky. We have similar ideals, but beyond that we are not very similar. We don’t have very similar interests, very similar backgrounds. She’s from Botswana, raised there for seven years. I’m from Colorado and have lived in the same house my whole life. But we somehow just sort of complete the other person. It’s funny because if I hadn’t met my fire door neighbors, then I would have had a completely different experience at Harvard, which is weird to think about. I don’t even know what the alternative would be because we are so close.”
DICHABA:
“We met maybe the third day of school, only a few days after we moved in. The first two days, my roommate and I had been hearing Kathleen’s voice through the fire door. I remember the first time I ever heard her she was giving a tour of her room to someone and she was like, “and this is my bathroom!” And my roommate and I thought. ‘Oh my God—we’re going to have to listen to this person for a whole year.’I think the next day was the first dorm-wide study break so that everyone could meet. And that’s how we met. We met her roommate and we said, ‘We can hear you through the fire door,’ and her roommate said, ‘Oh, that’s Kathleen,’ and then she pointed her out and we met her. Kathleen’s birthday is in October and I remember we were in Lamont that night: Kathleen, my other roommate, and myself. We surprised her by buying her a slice of cake and presenting it to her at midnight. And Kathleen freaked out and said, ‘Let’s block together!’ Though we didn’t talk about blocking officially until the next semester, we knew we’d be friends for a long time. We’re very different. She’s very loud and vivacious, which is definitely what my freshman roommate and I first noticed about her. It could have been something that was annoying if we didn’t know her, but because we know her that’s a huge part of what we love about her. I’m more quiet, but I think we kinda balance each other out in that way. We both like to dance and go out together. Our academic interests are very different and extracurriculars as well, but we’re very considerate of each other’s lives. She’s been a huge part of my Harvard experience.”

Last Wednesday at the Cantab Lounge’s weekly poetry slam open mic, no one snapped and hardly anyone wore black. The doors opened at 7:15 p.m., and when I arrived 15 minutes later, the only space  that remained was a particularly sticky square foot of the floor. The black-walled basement was somehow more divey than the upper floor and smelled like illicit smoke.
The patrons holding plastic cups of water and beer and wilted slices of pizza were all, from an unscientific poll, repeat visitors. Everyone’s features were unspecific in the reddish light and no one took off their puffy jackets even in the packed room. Tonight we would hear from poets who had conscienciously signed-up in advance, waitlisted ones who hadn’t been as diligent, the headliner, Wes Hazard, and the eight competitors in the elimination-round “speed slam.” I could spot the competitors around the room, still scrawling into legal pads and Moleskines, all nerves, oblivious to the emcee.
The first, sacrificial entrant finally got up around 8:00 p.m. He read off a poem from an iPhone, his voice lapsing, more than once, into a Southie accent. Will Hunting was mentioned. The second read uncannily like T.S. Eliot circa “Prufrock.” The next few poets were likewise dissimilar: a father in a bowling shirt, a man in a sweater he admitted was accidentally bought without reading the “3” in “3XL,” a young woman in a beanie and plastic glasses. Once, the emcee accidentally subbed “poetaster” for (I think) “poet-master.” It was a slip, but not a Freudian one.
Some dozen poets in, I convinced myself that I had found the reason that people write metered plays. Spoken word, close as it is to unfiltered speech, is nevertheless strongly patterned, metered, rhymed, alliterated—not just by the virtuosos, but also by the absolute novices. It is not so far a cry from this, I thought, to five acts in iambic pentameter.
And then—the testicle poem: “Testicle Pain is Only Fun If It’s Not Yours.” This for the full, allotted 180 seconds. If a poem is, in fact, the best words in the best order, then an awful lot of said words were: “testicle.”
I had to duck out before the speed slam, rustling a dozen puffy coats on the way. The Cantab, I learned while leaving, is this year’s home of the National Poetry Slam. But just before I turned the doorknob, a sudden hush in the crowd gave me pause. The very recently outgrown teenager at the mic held neither iPhone nor laptop nor legal pad, which was immediately promising. He launched into “This Might Hurt a Little but It’s Ok Because You’re a Bitch,” a vicious aubade (two words I’ve never had to combine). It was perhaps the most aurally pleasing diatribe I’ve ever heard, and between his refusal to pause for breath and the crowd’s adoration, I was quite sad to leave.

It’s tucked on the corner of Dunster and Winthrop Streets, bright and inviting. Plush couches surround a TV, and a re-run of Family Guy provides background noise for bantering guests. Round tables encourage dinnertime conversation, and computer carrels serve as pockets of privacy. The building is clean, spacious, and (most importantly) it welcomes them with open arms.
“We try to make the shelter feel like home, and that involves getting to know the guests. Some guests are more receptive to that than others. Some people just want a place to stay and food to eat, and some guests want a personal connection,” Kelly A. Sullivan ’14, co-director of the Harvard Square Homeless shelter, says, describing her experience working at the shelter. Yet, the word “guest” echoes in her carefully articulate responses, never settling comfortably into place. Guest, visitor, boarder: No descriptor adequately encompasses the ambiguous status of those who frequent the shelter.
Their program functions on three levels: the shelter itself, the resource advocates, and the street team. The staff runs a lottery to determine which potential guests will spend the night at the shelter, and the two dozen chosen are provided with meals cooked by Harvard students, toiletries, laundry, and the invaluable aid of the resource advocates.
Three advocates chat with guests over dinner, offering both advice and company. Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, director of the Resource Advocates Program, explains, “We try to meet the guests wherever they are coming from. If they are coming to us saying they want help applying for jobs, getting food stamps, or finding housing, we will work with them to achieve what they want.... If a guest doesn’t really want help, we will just talk to them.”
Sometimes, conversation itself is the most valuable resource that can be offered. Rosenkrantz remembers one guest in particular. “He was at a very low place, and he was struggling,” she recalls. “I gave him a blanket and I did some research on his behalf. It wasn’t much, and it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary that a director or supervisor would not usually do. He was so grateful, and he made it very clear that an individual just taking time out of the day to even think about him was something that didn’t happen on a regular basis.”
Sullivan’s voice grows quiet when she describes the harrowing solitude that plagues the homeless. “When I was working at St. James Shelter [the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s summer incarnation] over the summer, we had a guest who panhandled in Harvard Square. When he first started staying with us he was very motivated and optimistic about his outlook,” she recalls.
“Over the course of the summer you could see him get more despondent over his situation. Someone stole his guitar that he would bring into the shelter, and then someone stole his laptop so he didn’t know how to get a job. One night he didn’t come to the shelter, so I went out looking for him. He was just panhandling in front of The Coop. He was in a really low place. I was sitting with him as he was panhandling, and it put me in his position,” Sullivan says.
“What is most devastating about this condition isn’t that people don’t give you whatever change is in their pocket, but that people just treat you as an object–they don’t make eye contact, they ignore you when you reach out to them,” Sullivan explains. “I can’t generalize for everyone who panhandles, but a lot of it is just wanting any form of acknowledgement.”
Rosenkrantz explains that many students view homelessness as an inevitable part of the campus landscape, contending, “We can walk past the homeless and not even look down or anything. That is very much human nature to try to shut other people’s suffering out. We would never fault anyone for doing that, but I think that the people I work with are very passionate about fighting that mentality.”
The shelter’s “Street Team” embodies this passion, traversing the Square on a nightly basis. Charles A. Hobbs ’13, co-director of the shelter, explains, “Every night, we have a group of three volunteers go out around the Square with food, blankets, hand warmers, and give them out to people who aren’t in the shelter that night but who might want a sandwich or someone to talk to.”
These conversations grow into valuable relationships that exist both inside and outside of the shelter. “The fact that they come up to chat and want to engage with me make, even in the Square, me feel like I’m doing something right,” admits Charles. The barriers between volunteer and guests are broken down and replaced by an overpowering feeling of mutual respect and genuine care. Sullivan describes her first experience closing this fissure, remembering a guest that “would have intense philosophical discussions with the other guests. I could very well see him just as easily as a student. Going into Harvard, you think if you work hard, you get places... the shelter can be a very stressful place as you deal with poverty head on. You have to accept the fact that the world is not a meritocracy.”
Acceptance becomes key in this line of work; volunteers must grapple with the unsettling truth that many of their guests will continue to struggle for years despite the students’ efforts. “Homelessness can be not only a temporary transition, but a long-term trap,” admits Hobbs. Sullivan acknowledges the unavoidable limits of their work, admitting, “We are an emergency shelter. We recognize that we aren’t providing a stable environment for the guests. It is something we have come to accept within the bounds.”
However, the good memories can provide fuel when tougher scenarios emerge. “We try to hold onto successes,” confides Rosenkrantz. “They don’t come very frequently, because it is a cycle where we see the same people over and over again.”
These energizing victories are found in successful transitions as well as small gestures between guests. Speaking with playful candor, Rosenkrantz’s stories of her relationships at the shelter mimic those of any normal friendship. She confides, “There is a guest at the shelter now who knows that I really like Fruit Roll-Ups, and so whenever he has some he’ll give one to me. Those little moments mean a lot.” Fumbling with her pen, she starts to laugh as she loses herself in another memory, recounting, “There was another guest who was an artist, and he would always be drawing in the shelter. I helped him get into a transitional program, and he gave me a piece of his art that is now hanging on my wall.”
The success and longevity of the shelter is rooted in these stories. As the students flurry around the kitchen, the scene feels more like family dinner than charity or service. Before our interview comes to a close, Sullivan makes a point to add one more thing. “I want to emphasize the feel of the community,” she smiles. “It is definitely, besides my blocking group, the closest community I have at Harvard.”

At Harvard, it can be difficult to tell history from myth. Archives, legends, and centuries-old student organizations all do their part in keeping both truth and stories alive. Harvard’s chairs sit at the heart of this process. The grand oak thrones that populate the sanctums, houses, and castles in Cambridge are all bulky reminders of the weight of the past on Harvard’s present.
Not much is known of these relics. Harvard’s grand chairs have historically been located on Mount Auburn Street, which once spilled over with the fine luxury clubs and private dorms that earned it the title of Harvard’s "Gold Coast." In the murky early years of the 20th century, the student organizations near Mount Auburn—the Crimson, the Lampoon, and the Advocate—began to commission their own seats of scrolling arms and heavy feet.
The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, had one such grand seat reserved for its president in its early years. But the original dark and stately chair went missing, as objects of status are wont to do, and was never recovered. In 1967, alumni donors gifted an unknown amount of money for the construction of a new chair made of Honduran mahogany.
The Lampoon has a strict no-picture policy inside the castle. Lampoon President Eric R. Brewster ’14 and and his roommate Tyler M. Richard ’14, a member of the Lampoon’s business board, both report that the chair was constructed on-site since it was too big to fit through the tiny blue-and-yellow door of the organization. The farcical size serves a practical function as well—it is insurance against theft. If the Lampoon Chair ever vanishes in the middle of an event, it will have left the building in pieces.
The Advocate’s humble, human-sized throne, which easily fits out the door, fell victim to real theft in 1995. Harvard Police suspected a harmless student prank and investigated no further. While the oldest publications on campus often make these chairs the subject of light-hearted pranking, it is easy to forget that these artifacts hold real historical and monetary value.  A Harvard parent happened to salvage the throne only a year later at an antiques fair in Malden, MA—but how it got there remains a mystery.
The solid and humble arts-and-crafts style chair now rests in its rightful home on the second-floor sanctum of the Advocate building at 21 South Street. The chair dates back to 1919, when the Advocate ordered a stately chair built for their house, then sandwiched between the Crimson and the Lampoon at 53 Mount Auburn Street. When the Advocate moved locations in 1957, the chair was paraded through the streets of Cambridge behind a white horse with white cardboard wings, a representation of the Pegasus, an Advocate motif.
Unlike other chairs, the Harvard University Band’s "Throne" has clear provenance—and has never been stolen. The Throne stems from the flourishing tradition of grand chairs created nearly 40 years ago by student publications, but was loaned to the Band by the University. In 1953, the Band received a notice, according to a letter that hangs on a wall next to the Band Manager’s office, that the Dean’s Office would like "to loan a chair to the Band on a permanent basis if it would be acceptable" to be used as the Manager’s chair. The Band’s Throne is nearly eight feet tall, edged with molding in the egg-and-dart style, and is topped with a brass plate inscribed with the Band’s motto, Illegitimum non Carborundum, which is bad Latin loosely translated as "don’t let the bastards grind you down." The chair is in terrible condition, its dark wood scratched and discolored.
The equally tall, blonde-colored Crimson chair sits chained in the center of The Crimson’s second-floor sanctum on Plympton Street. It has been stolen many times throughout its history, and the chains and locks securing the chair to the warped wooden floor have grown thick and tangled. On the front of the chair is the organization’s name couched in simple carved scrollwork. On the back are plaques engraved with the names of Crimson presidents since 1903 (as well as Franklin D. Roosevelt ’04, retroactively added). Some of the brass plaques have fallen off in repeated pranks by the Lampoon. In 2011, the chair was flown across the country and made a surprise appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show. Later that year, it was stolen during a Lampoon parade honoring the Boston Bruins as "The Best Sports Team Ever."
Despite Lampoon-sponsored jaunts across the country, The Crimson’s chair has changed very little over the years. More names of Crimson presidents, engraved on plaques, have been added, but a picture of the chair in 1910 could have been taken yesterday.
Today, Richard, the Advocate’s current President, does not worry about his throne being pranked—even after being legitimately stolen, the throne is neither chained nor locked in the smoky sanctum at 21 South Street. Rather, Richard worries more about how little institutional memory exists at the Advocate.
And indeed, in all Harvard’s student organizations, members file in and out within the space of four years, leaving little documentation of their time or impact. In some ways, then, the marks or memories they leave on these chairs reify them as relics. The chairs become more real than the fleeting presence of the organizations they represent.
Richard recognizes this in his inability to pin down much of the history surrounding its artifacts. He finds the disconnect "very problematic and a little unsettling." For Richard, the chairs play some part in rectifying this disconnect. As he says, "These chairs function as a totem through time."

Photographers surrounded the stage, wielding cameras like semi-automatics.  The occasional campus cop made rounds through the crowd. I was sandwiched between two strangers in the back of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. Trapped in my folding chair, I was an easy target. If the large and bulky-dressed man next to me had a gun, exit would be impossible.
Luckily, I was not the target. During last Wednesday’s forum at the Institute of Politics, all of the photographers’ guns were pointed at NRA President David Keene.
I can’t say that I support the NRA; guns (even water guns) give me nightmares. But I’m starting to see why Keene supports the Bill of Rights. He probably could have used a gun to defend himself, or the right to remain silent.
Throughout his conversation with John King and subsequent Q&A session with Harvard students, Keene was attacked from every angle. Students fired questions like snipers strategically placed around the stage, on the stairs of the forum room, and balconies. I’m pretty sure some students were hiding out under the stage, just to make sure all bases were covered.
Students used public opinion statistics, past inconsistencies, and words like “propaganda” and “completely inappropriate.” They appealed to our founding fathers; would they still support an unrestrained Second Amendment in a world of assault rifles? Keene tried to defend himself by referencing problems with mental illness and the occasional deer-hunting anecdote. Those defenses did little to dismantle the palpable fury.
When moderator John King asked the audience who supported the idea that no one should be able to own a gun, hundreds of hands shot into the air. In another state, Keene might have been crowned a hero, a man protecting our fundamental rights. Not here. To us, he was the man responsible for promoting armed guards in schools, hassling Congress, and making it easier for gun-related violence to continue.
When I told my dad that I was going to see the president of the National Rifle Association, he asked me to go easy on him—to say something nice, compliment his glasses.  “He is going to face a lot of flack,” my dad said, and I thought, rightfully so.
As I sat in the JFK forum room that was filled with animosity, I was comforted by the fact that my classmates were unarmed. They could do enough damage with their words alone.

Occasionally, faculty members ask students to draft a recommendation letter that they will then sign on. FM imagines one of these letters.
[Name], or as I like to call her, best friend, is a fantastic student to work with. She reminds me so much of myself. We are so alike that sometimes I wonder if we’re the same person. For example, sometimes she finishes my sentences, or starts them, or does both.
I just love advising [Name]. She doesn’t know this, but I specifically requested to be her mentor because I felt like she didn’t need very much advising—she already knows everything I can teach her.
I think [Name] is a natural leader. I know I’m older and taller than she is, but I still look up to her and want to be just like her. She’s also great at empathizing with others. I feel like she really understands me personally, almost as if she can channel my spirit when she writes.
And then don’t get me started about her skills. Look no further than [Name]’s writing abilities. Her main strength is fiction writing. She can make up stories from nothing at all. She can also use Word. I’ve seen her type; she’s fast!
She also has many, many friends. She’s great at laughing loudly when I walk by. I’ve totally noticed how funny she is because of that. Also, I completely don’t mind the parties that she has—if anything, I’m only upset that I’m not invited to them. I go to them all anyway.
I have no hesitation in recommending [Name] for this position. That is why I wrote this recommendation myself. Personally, with no help whatsoever.

UPDATED: April 23, 2013, at 7:54 p.m.
On a Thursday night in the spring of 2012, students huddled in study groups in Lamont Café, racing against the clock to finish an assignment due the next day. Notes and textbooks were shared, suggestions passed back and forth. There were dozens of students there, or at least enough that voices echoed to amplify the buzz of discussion.
The task’s guidelines for completion were hazy, and the fact that the course had many section leaders with varying expectations heightened the confusion. It was easy for members in the crowd to help each other out. For those who didn’t understand, didn’t have time, or just didn’t care, group work turned into copying.
That summer, after Lamont had emptied out for the semester, the accusations came. The cheating was “unprecedented in anyone's living memory,” according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
But the students who had collaborated in Lamont that spring evening faced no accusations. They had not been enrolled in Government 1310.
***
The students in Lamont, who were described by a fellow classmate, had been working on a problem set for Economics 10. It was Government 1310, though, that received national attention after Harris announced in August that the Administrative Board was investigating approximately 125 students for inappropriate collaboration on a take-home final in a spring course.
The scandal was followed by months of discussion and closed-door deliberations, ending this February 1 with an announcement from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith that left the results hushed and inconclusive. Over half of the students were forced to withdraw; about half of the remaining cases resulted in disciplinary probation.
Government 1310 has been treated by some administrators as the unfortunate exception, an isolated incident whose case has now been closed. But as academic integrity dances uncertainly through a campus whose gates and walls are engraved with a motto of truth, Veritas is at stake.
The scandal speaks to a more systemic problem with the value Harvard places on its undergraduate education. The institution and the community condones, if not promotes, academic dishonesty, emphasizing prestige over intellectual growth. Academics are no longer the priority of the students or teachers at Harvard College.
 No Surprises
Days before the August announcement of the Government 1310 investigations, Brett Flehinger filled a newly created position, associate secretary of the Administrative Board, aimed at promoting awareness of policies surrounding the issue of academic integrity.
His appointment seemed to signal an acknowledgement from the University that academic dishonesty is a widespread issue in need of address, and yet a reluctance to acknowledge a culture of cheating beyond Government 1310 persists.
“I think to say that there is a particular culture here that causes [academic dishonesty]—I don’t even know how we would measure that culture in the first place, but even if we could—I don’t think that would be accurate,” Flehinger says, when asked whether there are underlying factors that promote academic dishonesty at the College.
Flehinger’s statement casts Government 1310 as an example of the extreme: 125 students taking advantage of one class’s unclear collaboration policy.
“Collaboration,” recalls Igor Liokumovich ’15, who took Ec 10 last spring, of the general environment surrounding the course. “It wasn’t that. It wasn’t collaboration on homework; it was passed down very much the same as I heard the scandal was.” He pauses. “But I feel like it’s like that with any large class, you know? I don’t think it was specific to Ec 10.”
Liokumovich jokingly recalls “200 freshman in Lamont Café, trying to scramble to get stuff together” as they completed their problem sets.
“Because only your section TF grades your work, and if you have friends from six different sections,” he adds, “there’s no way you’d get caught.”
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Professor N. Gregory Mankiw writes that students who do copy and are not caught will still suffer in the exams, as he believes that the problem sets are the best way to prepare.
Conditions in Economics 10 mirrored those in Government 1310. “I wasn’t surprised,” says Darragh J. Nolan ’15, who took Government 1310 last spring, of learning that almost half of his classmates had been accused of plagiarism. Given the circumstances of the test, he explains, it would have been very easy to circulate the answers.
According to Nolan, the class came with expectations of its own: In the first lecture, he explains, the instructor Matthew B. Platt “sold it as an easy class,” reading out comments from the last year’s Q Guide student evaluations and alluding to its apparent lack of difficulty. The course, whose final grade included no participation element and was composed entirely of scores from four take-home exams, became more difficult than originally anticipated, Nolan thinks, and so students bent the already flexible rules.
Platt did not respond to a request for comment on this story. While Flehinger was the only senior Harvard official interviewed for this story, a Harvard spokesperson had not returned repeated requests for comment on the published story nearly two months after its publication.
Learning to Teach
 This prevalence of academic dishonesty is symptomatic of a pervading mentality on campus that neglects the classroom.
Nicolaus Mills ’60, a literature professor at Sarah Lawrence College, points to a weak emphasis on undergraduate teaching as an underlying factor that enabled the scandal to take place on Harvard’s campus. “The [government] department certainly supervises [Platt’s] scholarship, but were they also interested in or even caring about his teaching?” Mills asks.
Mills does not directly criticize Platt’s teaching, but rather suggests that a departmental environment that focuses more on professor research can undermine a focus on class time. He cites what he believes was an even more serious problem for the students: “A sense on the students’ part that what they were asked to know was not terribly significant.”
A lack of respect for the course might follow, according to Mills. “If students feel any sort of affection for their teacher,” he says, “it’s very hard to cheat. Or if they think they’re learning something valuable, there’s no incentive to cheat—they really want to pursue the knowledge.”
As professors invest less time in the classroom—a product of pressures to establish themselves primarily as researchers—so too do teaching fellows and students.
Liokumovich says that although some teaching fellows for Ec 10 were “absolutely wonderful,” others did not take their role or their teaching seriously. “I used to get p-sets back from my first TF that just didn’t have anything on them—just numbers, no feedback,” he says. Liokumovich was so unsatisfied with his section that he ended up switching out: “I said, ‘It can’t be worse—you can’t get any worse.’ It ended up being not that much better.”
Mankiw’s own teaching rarely supplemented that of his teaching fellows; Liokumovich recalls that he only saw him a handful of times the whole year. He remembers a website, popular while he was a student in the class, called “Is Mankiw Teaching Today?”
The website, he describes, featured a photo of Mankiw, with the text reading, “Nah, maybe next week.”
Mankiw admits that there is “inevitable heterogeneity” in TFs, even though they are trained and screened thoroughly. “If we moved to more large lectures and fewer sections, the Ec 10 experience would be more homogeneous but less personal,” he writes.
As Dean of the College from 1995 to 2003, Harry R. Lewis ’68 frequently spoke with deans of Harvard’s peer institutions about allegations of widespread cheating, noting a similar lack of trust between students and professors as a uniting characteristic of these cases.
“The modal Harvard student takes their courses as seriously as they think the instructor is taking the course,” says Lewis, now Director of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science. “Situations in which you get multiple cases of breach of academic integrity [are] where there is a general consensus or a general feeling in the student body that the instructor is somehow behaving dishonorably, or unfairly, or bizarrely in some way that is contrary to Harvard students’ general expectation that if they’re going to have to work hard, the professor should damn well seem to be working hard too.”
Lewis says that while changes in class procedures might help to reduce cases of academic dishonesty, he feels a larger conversation about teaching practice must occur among the Harvard faculty.
“Any faculty member who doesn’t have the basic idea right that they’re actually supposed to teach in a way that their students are going to learn, and that that requires a certain kind of mutual trust and confidence—their teaching isn’t going to be improved just by the fact that they give one kind of exam rather than another kind of exam. You may cut down the number of cases of academic dishonesty, but what’s really important is to try to instill some sense of what the mission of teaching actually is,” Lewis says.
Mills, too, echoes the thought that engaging faculty in a conversation about teaching proves challenging at Harvard, where attention to students and personal research projects compete for professors’ time. “At Harvard, one always worries that junior faculty receive the subliminal message that your future lies in your publications, and your students are your second issue,” he says.
“I don’t in any way put this on the student body,” Lewis says. “Some of my colleagues don’t like to hear me say this, but [to] anybody at Harvard who complains about Harvard students, I just want to tell them, ‘Okay, go find a better set of students and go teach there instead. Stop this. This is as good as it gets in American higher education. Stop it. Deal with it.’ It’s on us.”
 Shifts on Campus 
A certain gap between students and professors may always have existed within in the university.
“I do remember in my day that to drop by a professor’s office, you either had to be in great trouble, or you had to have some brilliant idea,” Mills remembers.
But he now speaks of a different “entrepreneurial quality” of today’s University, one that has developed since he was a student on a campus. “There’s an increasing loyalty [of faculty] to career and entrepreneurial interests, and decreasing loyalty to students,” Mills says. “At Harvard and so many major universities, you’re not rewarded either with salary or promotion by virtue of the quality of your teaching. Young faculty get that message, and so do students.”
In the past, says Howard E. Gardner ’65, a different value was placed on professors. Presidents such as Lawrence H.  Summers “didn’t just weigh people based on their peer review or their publications, but asked, ‘Would these people bring intellectual breadth to the school?’” Nowadays the University might place a greater focus on  faculty members’ degrees and titles. Harvard still has professors who attract genuine student interest by appealing to broad audiences; Gardner names Michael Sandel, Steven Pinker, and Niall Ferguson. “But that’s not how they got tenure,” he says.
Gardner, now a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, thinks a different method pervaded when he was an undergraduate on campus: Houses in the Square were cheaper, campus felt smaller, and most professors—whose ranks he would one day join—lived scattered around Cambridge and closer to the the University. Nowadays, he says in comparison, “there’s much less of a community, both in the sense of one that is geographically close, but also in the sense that students and faculty want to spend time with each other.” Faculty tend to be more insular, more focused on their research, “more on airplanes to God knows where,” he says.
Gardner calls himself a “lifer”—over 50 years into his scholarship at Harvard and a member of a dwindling group, including those such as Lewis—that maintains more than a transactional relationship with the University.
Gardner sees a matching decline in students’ interest of the professorial life, or “the professorial persona.” Students now identify more with CEOs of corporations or hedge funds than they do with the figure lecturing behind the podium.
As professors focus on their research, and students worry about securing career opportunities, both sides become increasingly disinterested in the classroom.
“Nowadays there’s much less willingness on the part of the students to take courses or to have majors for which they don’t see the utilitarian application,” he says. Students take less time to explore intellectually, worried more about carving out a tangible path for their futures.
Gardner cites the extensive recruitment for investment banking, management, and consulting firms as potentially adding fuel to the fire. This emphasis on what he calls a “one-way race to Wall Street, Silicon Valley, or Hollywood” comes with an “inordinate” worry about maintaining near-perfect grades—the only foreseeable path to weighty titles and even heavier paychecks.
But he finds that many students will be happier “as social worker[s] at an inner city school,” for example, than they might be at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Lewis points not to outside influences, but to the very framework of Harvard’s  undergraduate degree.  “I think we’ve got too much structure and not enough educational idealism and motivation. So students take the set of opportunities that we offer them as instructions about what we value,” he says.
Students fixate on fulfilling requirements—pursuing language certificates, secondary fields, even joint concentrations. “We all ought to feel more comfortable telling students that they don’t actually have to do all these things. They’re actually here to get an education,” Lewis says. “They’re already into Harvard. They don’t have to keep acting like they acted in high school in order to get into Harvard. Stop it. You’re in.”
 A Costly Success
When an education holds less value than the prestige that follows, dishonesty can be more easily justified as a means to an end. Harvard becomes simply a pit-stop on the way.
Along with these new definitions of success comes its reckless pursuit, by which, Gardner believes, students have become “hollow” in an ethical sense that plays out in an educational setting: They are not only more inclined to cheat, but are also more likely to see it as acceptable. He cites the example of Marilee Jones, former Dean of Admissions at MIT, who resigned in 2007 after admitting that she had lied on her own resume regarding her education. In a group of 15 students from another school to which Gardner spoke, none thought she should have been fired. Jones, they said, had been doing a good job—and everyone lies on their resume, after all.
Former University President Summers, too, says values concerning academic integrity instilled in a college hold far-reaching effects on students. “I said often as president that a nation whose colleges tolerated cheating should not be surprised when leaders proved corruptible. Nor should it be surprising when inflated grades are followed after a generation by inflated profit reports,” Summers writes in an email.
It is the University’s responsibility, Gardner thinks, to speak up against the mindset that values titles over integrity.“I would like to see the president of Harvard speak up and say, ‘We want to judge the quality of our education not by salary received, or by the prominence of the name of the institution you go to work at next, but rather by your recorded happiness and satisfaction of life,’” he says.“
They ought to be bringing those [who live these values] to campus and giving them honors and attention, even if they can’t put their name in the building,” or on it, Gardner believes.
But all members of Harvard’s community must do more to show these principles. Gardner cites his “dozen-year-old” Volkswagen beetle and the letters from scholars and friends that decorate the walls in his office, instead of diplomas or trophies, as examples of his attempt to do so.
“We need to talk about things that are priceless,” he says. “What is priceless, as compared to what can be monetized?”
 The A’s in Harvard
In response to these problems, those within and outside the College have suggested introducing an honor code, to promote the type of collaboration that depends not on following the path to an easy A, but instead on a campus that commits itself to a high standard of academic integrity.
“The old adage your mother probably told you, ‘When you cheat you’re only cheating yourself’—that isn’t necessarily true in this type of environment,” says Aine Donovan, director of the Ethics Institute at Dartmouth College. Cheating in an academic community disrupts all of campus, she says: Scores lose meaning, evaluations crumble, standards dissolve.
Donovan sees value in an honor code that holds students equally accountable for maintaining academic integrity on campus, an honor code that can be “woven into every fabric of the student experience,” as she describes Dartmouth’s. Donovan explains that Dartmouth’s code encourages students to talk directly to one another instead of immediately reporting all suspicions directly to a dean.
Donovan says that when she asks students whether they think other students abide by the code, most say yes. “And I ask, ‘Why do they do it?’ They almost exclusively say it’s because they’d be embarrassed not to, and because no one else is doing it—you’d look like a dummy in the class.”
But more importantly, the rationale behind the applications and consequences of an honor code must be lived by all on campus. “It’s a complicated process that’s not just about smacking people on the hand; it’s about really understanding, ‘Why do we have these rules? Why are they important?’” Donovan says.
“Typical Harvard,” chair of Princeton’s Honor Committee and senior Antonia Hyman remembers thinking when she heard about the Gov 1310 scandal. She describes Princeton students discussing the incident on campus: There was “the idea that that couldn’t happen here—that it wouldn’t happen here.”
Like Donovan, Hyman of Princeton stresses that students have a twofold responsibility both to refrain from cheating and to report students they suspect have done so. Princeton’s honor committee was established in 1893 after students approached the administration demanding its creation: The university had gained a reputation for being easy and of low standards, Hyman says. “The Princeton degree was becoming somewhat of a joke."
The Undergraduate Honor Committee has since been entirely student-run, handling all violations of the honor system that involve all written examinations that occur in the classroom. Hyman says around half of the reports that she receives are directly from students themselves.
“If you have no students that are reporting, that means your standards aren’t aligned with the student body,” Hyman says. What concerns her most about Harvard’s case is that to her knowledge not one student had spoken up to report it.
Gardner, too, says he wants to hear more about the students who did not cheat in Government 1310, the side of Harvard’s scandal that was not publicly discussed. “Did any of them even attempt to blow the whistle?” he asks.
Perhaps Princeton’s self-reporting, as a sign of the honor code’s success, depends on the school’s greater sense of community: Princeton’s grade deflation (a 92 still counts as a B+), Hyman thinks, creates a system of trust and honesty among her peers. “We all collectively suffer through it together,” she says. Students think, “Yes, it sucks, but I’m not going to cheat because I know it sucks for you too.”
Princeton’s different emphasis on grades also contributes to a different standard for hard work. “We hear about our friends at Harvard who are just breezing through,” Hyman jokes. “And here, when you get an A, you’re like, ‘Oh my god, sweet Jesus, thank you!’”
Nolan, who took Government 1310, and serves on Harvard’s Committee on Academic Integrity, reveals a sentiment similar to Hyman’s impressions: “It’s no surprise that Harvard’s a very competitive place—everyone knows that—and sometimes the idea of getting a high GPA is above the actual purpose of the process of learning.”
The roughly 30-member committee was established in the fall of 2010 and includes about eight student members. In recent months, the group has been working to provide suggestions in response to the scandal that will refocus conversations around integrity on campus.
 Beyond the Ad Board
After students in Computer Science 50 had turned in their final problem set this fall, Rob T. Bowden ’13 gathered the suspicious cases—students who had already been noted for handing in problem sets similar to others’—to turn over to instructor David Malan, who sent the cases in which he sensed a “smoking gun” to the Ad Board for further investigation.
“I just always think, what put someone in the situation where they felt compelled to cheat?” asks Bowden, head TF of the course. “Is it a factor of the environment?”
David Malan’s popular “Introduction to Computer Science” has a unique advantage in detecting cases of cheating: A simple algorithm run on the work students submit can detect similarities in their codes, combing through problem sets handed in as far back as 2007. Three years after the first time Bowden ran the program during his first year as a TF, he remembers his surprise, not only at the number of cases that were caught, but also by how these students were “so blatantly cheating and expecting to get away with it.”
Bowden expands on his initial question: “Are people too pressured here—that when you’re stretched too thin, you just have to give in?”
In past years, CS50 has sent around two percent of its students to the Ad Board; in the fall of 2011 class of 607 students, that amounts to about 12 classmates in total.
“I think we’ve always been by far the biggest Ad-Boarder,” Bowden says—except for Government 1310, he says on second thought.
He has heard of members of the Ad Board criticizing CS50 for doing so—statements like, “you must be doing something wrong,” or, “your policies aren’t clear enough.”
But the number of cases CS50 sends to the Ad Board is a result of the class structure that approaches academic integrity with its only antidote: honesty.
CS50 had one of the highest enrollments at the College with 714 students this fall, and a staff of 110 that ran almost 70 sections a week. But the number of cases sent to the Ad Board fell to around one percent of the total class, even as course enrollment grew.
Bowden says he is convinced that the numbers are falling, despite an often “poorly-defined line” on what constitutes cheating on the internet, because of the course’s explicit expectations. Students may speak in English about their work, but not in code, and this year the teaching staff openly discussed the algorithm that detects cheating in class.
Students might also have feared the repercussions of Government 1310. “This past fall in particular there was a marked increase in awareness of and sensitivity to issues of academic honesty, almost to the point of overcorrection,” writes Malan in an email, “whereby some students in CS50 were unnecessarily disinclined to have what would’ve been perfectly reasonable, instructive conversations with classmates.”
CS50 remains notorious for its difficulty, yet consistently ranks high on the student evaluation Q Guide: This past semester, 30 percent of students labeled the course as “very difficult,” but 41 percent said they would “recommend [the course] with enthusiasm.” A comment reads, “This is going to be one of the most amazing experiences of your college experience. No other large course on campus fosters the kind of relationships and culture that cs50 does. It will be hard [...] but there are so many resources made available to you that you can always find help and get your questions answered.“
Malan places an emphasis on both teaching and learning, stressing the classroom experience and adding “elements of playfulness that make its culture, we hope, fun to be part of,” Malan writes. “There’s a lot to be said for that spoonful of sugar.”
Although the number of the class’s Ad Board cases decreased this fall, “It’s not very comforting to think, ‘Oh, if you wouldn’t have caught us, we would have cheated,’” Bowden says. It’s this emphasis on refraining from cheating due to punitive, rather than moral, consequences, that Gardner, too, believes to be the wrong approach.“
At the very heart of any serious educational institution,” Gardner says, “you submit work that you own and credit sources when it’s not your own. I believe this in my DNA and in my blood, and if I believe this, I’m not being honest because of fear of penalty. I’m being honest because I think it’s the right thing to do.”
Bowden agrees: “No one ever pleads for the morality of the situation,” he says of alternatives. “Or even says, ‘Don’t put your friend in the situation of needing to give you their work.’”
For Gardner, reactions to this year’s examination of academic integrity, like eliminating take-home exams, are simply “bandaids.” On this campus, the problems are rooted much deeper below the surface, in the devaluing of the academic experience itself.
If the public announcement of the Government 1310 investigation was intended to turn the scandal into a “teaching opportunity,” as Harris wrote in his initial August announcement, Harvard must honestly examine whether its reputation as a leader in academics can be supported by structures that perpetuate academic dishonesty.
“Do you want to live in a society where everyone lies on their resume, where everybody plagiarizes?” Gardner asks. “If you don’t blow a whistle on yourself or others, that’s the kind of society you’re going to live in.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
 CORRECTION: February 28, 2013
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misquoted professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who in fact described a “modal,” not “model,” Harvard student as one who treates a course with the same degree of seriousness as he or she perceives the professor to be treating it. The article also incorrectly quoted Antonia Hyman, chair of Princeton’s Honor Committee, as saying that she believes the absence of student reports about cheating indicate that honesty standards “are aligned with the student body.” In fact, Hyman described conditions under which she perceives that standards “aren’t aligned” with the student perspective.
Sections
“I made a promise that when I hit college, I wasn’t going to worry about labels and what other people thought. The beginning of senior year was when I began identifying as transgender,” says John, a student at the college who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want his gender identity known to his family, which still considers him female. “Junior year was when I really started thinking about it.”
Charlie, another transgender student who has been granted anonymity by The Crimson because he wanted his gender identity to stay private, relates a similar experience. “I knew that I was a gay man at a pretty young age, and was feeling like I was an impostor,” he says. Yet having been born biologically female in rural Virginia, there were no places where Charlie felt comfortable discussing both his sexuality and gender identity, neither of which matched what was expected of him. “I had no access to resources and didn’t know anyone who was trans.”
He continues, “I felt like I would be alone for the rest of my life.”
Misunderstood identities
As perhaps the least-recognized group in the BGLTQ acronym, Ariel C. Churchill ’15 explains, there exist a lot of misconceptions about trans individuals—people whose gender identities don’t align with the gender assigned to them at birth. These identities may fall within or outside of the male/female binary, or may include aspects of both male and female.
Churchill, who does not identify as trans, is cochair of the Trans Task Force, a student group promoting awareness of trans issues and advocacy on campus. She says that the concept can be a difficult one for people to understand.
“There’s a lot of weight to the idea of being trans. It implies a lot of historical oppression,” Churchill says. First, says Churchill, is “the idea that someone who is transgender is a man trapped in a woman’s body, or vice versa.” In fact, says Churchill, many trans-identified people don’t feel that way.
Another misconception is that all trans people seek to alter their bodies. “For some people, there is a level of body dysphoria,” or intense bodily discomfort, she says. While some who feel that way do seek surgery, continues Churchill, this doesn’t account for all people who identify as trans. “For many people, they are perfectly happy with their bodies, and to them, transgender means a different kind of gender expression.”
“When you meet a new person, the first thing that you will code into your mind is gender. Before race, before whether they are good looking or not, you will decide whether that person is male or female,” says Churchill. She adds that this can make it difficult for some people to accept a more nuanced view of gender. “If you tell people that there is more than male or female, they will disagree, because then they have no security in what they think.”
Finding a Community
John says that he first came out to members of the Harvard community during Visitas. After the experience, John says, he realized that he wasn’t ready to come out to others.
“When I got here, there was the LGBTQ meet and greet, and I didn’t really know anyone in the room,” he says. “That’s when I fully said my gender identity out loud in front of basically strangers.” Though he was excited in the moment, John says, “Afterwards, I felt I wasn’t actually ready to come out.”
For Charlie, Harvard was immediately more comfortable than the community in which he had grown up. “I found that there were resources if I looked hard enough,” Charlie says.
This sense of personal comfort was a stark difference from the sense of danger he had faced elsewhere. “I was in a lot of danger at home. Physical danger when people began to notice that I was queer,” Charlie says. Yet life at Harvard was different. “When I came here, I didn’t feel unsafe,” he continues. “I wasn’t worried about sleeping at night.”
John and Charlie, who are both members of the Trans Task Force, allude to the organization as a safe space among people who understand their concerns.John emphasizes the benefit of being in a community where he doesn’t have to constantly educate others about his identity. “It’s nice having a space where you don’t have to preface everything with an explanation,” John says.
Daily Struggles, Long-Term Improvements
One issue that trans students face on a daily basis is a lack of gender-neutral spaces on campus. According to Churchill, two major manifestations of this concern are anxieties and risks concerning housing and public bathrooms. When it comes to restrooms, Churchill says, some students must ask themselves,“‘Do I go into the women’s room and get yelled at, or into the men’s room and get beat up?’”
According to the Queer Students and Allies’s 2006 report, the University has 73 single-stalled, gender neutral bathrooms on campus.
John echoes Churchill’s sentiments, asserting that he “hates bathrooms” and places like clothing stores, which distinguish people based on binary gender identities.
Although daily life can be a constant negotiation of discomfort and risk, according to Charlie, the university has become significantly more accommodating to trans students during his time at Harvard. He points to improvements in health care for trans students at University Health Services, including provisions accommodating students who wish to transition to a different gender through hormonal or surgical means. He also says the University has become more accommodating for students requesting gender-neutral housing.
“It can be difficult getting through the web of administrators,” says Charlie, “But recently the administration has done more to be more educated and more open.”
Advocating for Change
There are a number of barriers to political and social advocacy for and by trans individuals, yet the community has also managed to make some strides.“In general, one of the biggest problems is that [trans people] get forgotten in the gay rights movement for many reasons,” Churchill says. “People in the LGB community sometimes will think that we will never advance if we also advance trans people, because society will not be able to handle that.”
Charlie adds that a lot of the issues that the trans community has faced in their campaign for equality deal with public perception of the group.
“The trans community is very small,” Charlie says. As a result of this, he continues, information about trans people is less readily accessible than education about other queer groups. This leads to the proliferation of harmful stereotypes.
On the other hand, Churchill points out, the trans community has made strides at universities like Harvard and at institutions like some Wall Street banks, which have implemented new policies to accommodate transgender employees.
Looking Forward
For many trans-identified individuals, however, their gender identity remains a daily struggle.
“I really would like to be stealth one day, and not have to be openly transgender, and be comfortable with my body,” John says. For him, the constant need to explain his gender identity to others can be exhausting, as “It gets tiring educating people all the time and being the go-to trans person.”
Though John affirms that this educational process is significant—and, in fact, crucial for making positive change—he envisions a time when greater understanding of trans identities will remove part of this burden. “One day, I would like not to have to do that,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two years of revamping its virtual presence, the Institute of Politics will launch its latest social media initiative next week to better connect undergraduate members with students beyond the Institute.
Under the student-run “Digital Brigade” campaign, a group of Harvard undergraduates will use various social media outlets, including Twitter and Facebook, to publicize IOP events.
About 15 students have pledged to man the Digital Brigade, but IOP Student Communications Director Kathryn G. Walsh ’14, who is managing the group, hopes to soon double that number.
The Digital Brigade is the most recent of a series of social and digital media upgrades implemented by the IOP to modernize its mission of inspiring “undergraduates to consider careers in politics and public service.”
Improvements began two years ago when the IOP’s governing body—the Senior Advisory Committee, chaired by Caroline B. Kennedy ’80—requested an audit of the IOP’s internal operations.
The strategic audit revealed flaws in the IOP’s communications strategy that staff have since attempted to remedy, according to IOP Director of Communications and Marketing Esten Perez. When Walsh joined the IOP her freshman spring, for example, the Institute’s use of social media was largely under the radar.
“I couldn’t have told you if we had a Twitter,” she said.
Twitter now plays a noticeable role in IOP Forums, an improvement championed by Kellie A. Ryan, the IOP’s first social media coordinator.
Since Ryan joined the IOP in October, subscriptions to the IOP’s YouTube channel have more than tripled. Last month, Ryan also oversaw the launch of the IOP’s blog, which currently has 5,600 views.
The IOP is using its digital campaign as a mechanism for reaching out to students “beyond the IOP, beyond Harvard,” Ryan said.
Social media also gives more students access to the Institute, said IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, calling the initiative “an attempt to address the reality that people have short attention spans.”
“People aren’t likely to sit at a computer for 90 minutes to watch a Forum,” Grayson said.
This realization inspired the “3 With IOP” series that now airs on YouTube. Each segment is three minutes long and poses three questions to IOP fellows and visitors.
“[Social media] amplifies the ability to share my expertise and my experiences with a broader group of students,” said current IOP Fellow Karen Hughes, a communications expert and one of former President George W. Bush’s top advisors.
The IOP plans to continue elevating the quality and quantity of its virtual presence, Perez said.
As the initiative moves forward, Walsh said that she hopes to see the IOP use online strategies to clarify its mission and program offerings for students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As parents of students in the Class of 2014 pack their bags and finalize travel arrangements for Junior Parents Weekend this coming Friday and Saturday, Harvard Square establishments are preparing for a flood of visitors by hiring extra staff and hiking up prices.
General Manager of The Charles Hotel Alex Attia said that the hotel will be approximately 90 percent full this weekend with rooms costing at least $300, which is $100 higher than prices later in March.
Other hotels in the Cambridge area are also close to capacity. The Courtyard by Marriott is nearly sold out, and the Sheraton Commander Hotel had only one room with a king-size bed as of Wednesday night.
According to Attia, the number of parents staying in The Charles over Junior Parents Weekend has remained relatively constant over the years.
“We usually do very well,” Attia said.
Only Harvard’s Commencement weekend attracts higher numbers of family members to the area, according to Attia. During that time, The Charles functions at full occupancy, and the cost of a room increases to over $800 per night, he added.
Attia said that The Charles will stock up on towels and increase the number of waiters in the hotel’s restaurants to accommodate the higher volume of guests. He hopes to ensure that patrons receive their food as quickly and efficiently as possible.
“Parents want to spend time with their children instead of waiting for their food to arrive,” he said.
Unlike last year, the Harvard Square Business Association did not encourage restaurants in Harvard Square to come up with a special menu for the weekend, according to Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson. Nevertheless, restaurants are anticipating an influx of guests as students leave the dining halls to enjoy a meal on their parents’ dime.
Managers and event coordinators from Sandrine’s Bistro and UpStairs on the Square confirmed that they are expecting more customers, and staff at First Printer Restaurant Bar & Grill said they will tailor their live band and Sunday brunch schedule to accommodate students and their parents.
“The restaurants love having families here,” Jillson said.
Just like the establishments they will soon patronize, parents of many juniors have been planning their time in Cambridge in advance.
“My parents booked the hotel rooms in November because they anticipated a lot of demand,” said Jordan A. Feyko ’14.
The parents of Kevin F. Hernandez ’14 booked their flights in January when he was home for winter break and will be staying at The Charles this weekend.
“They’ll never miss a chance to see me,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 28, 2013, at 4:23 a.m.
Fung Wah, the low-budget Chinatown bus service, has been ordered by federal and state officials to suspend service indefinitely following reports that the company’s fleet posed serious safety risk.
The Boston-based bus company, which offered services on the half-hour between South Station and Manhattan, voluntarily complied with the order Saturday evening, taking almost the entirety of its fleet off the road.
The effect the suspension will have on Harvard students remains unclear.
“I’m rattled,” said Matthew W. G. Walker ’16, who said he loved the bus. “I’d pay $15 for the cultural experience alone—last time I rode there were two elderly ladies sitting across the aisle who were performing some sort of ritualistic chant for all four hours of the overnight trip to New York. It was thrilling.”
“But actually, I dabbled with Greyhound, Bolt Bus, and Peter Pan, but found Fung Wah the most reliable,” Walker added.
This suspension is not the first time the bus service has attracted negative attention. In August 2005, a bus caught fire on Interstate 91. In September 2006, a bus rolled over, causing minor injury to 34 passengers. Recently, one of its fleet hit two pedestrians in Manhattan. Fung Wah’s drivers have also been found to be in the bottom three percent amongst their peers nationwide based on qualification, and the company has been cited for 159 maintenance violations since 2011.
Some students said they have always opted for other bus lines.
“I would never take Fung Wah, said Lexis B. Ross ’13. “I take Megabus.”
Other students, however, said they were disappointed that Fung Wah would cease operations indefinitely.
“It was nice to know that it was an option,” said Reshma A. Lutfeali ’13, who is an inactive Crimson news editor. “It’s also kind of sad that this institution of college life is being shut down.”

Kholoud Al-Faqih, the first female judge in a Palestinian Shari’a court, spoke of struggle and success as a part of the Harvard Divinity School’s “Women’s Rights in a Man’s World” panel on Wednesday.
The panelists—including Al-Faqih, her translator, and fellow female leaders and Divinity School affiliates Nidal Al-Azraq, Hauwa Ibrahim, Leila Ahmed, and moderator Gloria White-Hammond—discussed barriers for opportunities for women hoping to work within Shari’a law courts.
Al-Faqih was ranked the world’s tenth most powerful Arab woman by Arab Business in 2012 and was named one of the world’s most influential Muslims in 2012.
Al-Faqih told the room that in Palestine, “one of the hardest obstacles that we faced was the society. The society did not accept us because the society believed the idea that this position was only for religious males.”
Ibrahim, a Nigerian defense attorney and visiting professor at the Divinity School, said that “where one sex dominates—in this case maybe the male sex in Shari'a courts—progress, freedom, peace and sustainable development will be slowed.”
Though the process may be difficult, Al-Faquih said that women have the capability to create change and must change their perspective on themselves in order to succeed.
“As women, we have to look at ourselves from all directions, from all mirrors, not from a broken mirror,” Al-Faqih said. “If we look at ourselves, as women, through a broken mirror, we will see ourselves as parts, broken parts, and parts doesn’t mean anything. If we look at ourselves, as women, from a complete mirror, we will see a complete human being with full rights.”
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton said that this “inaugural conversation” was the first of many talks about the boundaries and divisions of religion and social justice, funded by the recent Susan Shallcross Swartz Endowment for Christian Studies.
Social and environmental activist Susan Shallcross Swartz, who attended the panel, said the talk fulfilled her hopes for the endowment.
“Our hope and vision is that these conversations will invigorate our understanding of Christian studies by exploring ethics and cross-cultural understanding,” Swartz said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With messages written in bold characters on their arms and faces and a host of diverse stories to recount, students and faculty members gathered at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday to partake in the photographic project “Dear World” of artist Robert X. Fogarty.
Throughout the day, Fogarty took photographs of dozens of Harvard community members, which he then showcased in the evening in a keynote address and slideshow at the John F. Kennedy Forum.
“I take people’s portraits, but they are not just any portraits,” said Fogarty, whose art consists of photographic snapshots of subjects with messages written on their skin.
“I ask people to share one message about someone or something that matters to them,” he said.
Fogarty’s project began in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as “Dear New Orleans.” In Louisiana, Fogarty took portraits of hurricane victims, firefighters, and volunteers. The project eventually expanded to become “Dear World.”
Scott J. Yim ’13, whose message read “You can’t always tell,” explained how people sometimes go through difficulties that are not immediately noticeable by others.
Yim recounted his experience coming out as a member of the LGBTQ community at the end of his sophomore year.
“It was quite a struggle, but I was fortunate enough to find amazing teammates, roommates, and friends,” said Yim, who has since spearheaded the production and distribution of “It Gets Better,” a video meant to provide encouragement to those who may be undergoing similar difficulties.
Kennedy School students Federico E. Cuadra Del Carmen and Pinar A. De Neve came to the forum in the afternoon to have the message “Help us, help others” photographed. The phrase is the motto of a global health non-governmental organization that both students work for.
“Our organization started off by fundraising for other NGOs—hence the motto,” De Neve said.
Harvard Divinity School student Jane L. Wolfe, who is 47 years old, teared up as she narrated the story behind her message, “GED to Harvard: Here I am. Yes you can.”
“I waited 32 years to get an education,” said Wolfe, who is the mother of two children and survived Hurricane Katrina. “The way you are going to make an impact is to go out in the world, and serve, and share your education with others. You can wait 32 years and still make an impact.”
Kennedy School student Jenny L. Mallamo said that she was happy to hear of her classmates’ stories “through a few simple words about where they want to go, what they have done, or what they do right now.”
“You, the people I photograph, have the ability to inspire and to lead us,” Fogarty said in conclusion to his address. “I hope we recognize that we all have voices and stories to tell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have penned their names to a petition that calls for the Food and Drug Administration to evaluate and act upon the health effects of climbing sugar levels in soda and sweetened beverages.
Created by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington D.C., the petition suggests new policy measures such as limiting soda serving sizes or requiring warning labels on soda products to avert some of the health risks associated with soda consumption.
According to the Center’s recent press release, the 15 teaspoons of sugar in an average 20-ounce cola are well over the recommended daily intake for men—nine teaspoons—and more than twice that of the six teaspoons recommended for women.
Because soda contains high levels of sugar and no additional nutritional value, researchers have concluded that soda contributes to health issues such as obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
However, the impact of soda on health goes largely unnoticed by consumers. It is easy to over-consume soda products because despite their high sugar content, they do not satisfy hunger the way food does, said Walter C. Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at HSPH.
Willett, who signed the petition, said that the policy changes proposed may take time to go into effect, since a number of organizations with close connections to the soda industry may use their lobbying power to influence the FDA’s opinion.
This is not the first time that researchers at the HSPH have called the FDA to action. In the 1990s, HSPH affiliates submitted a petition to the FDA to look into the health effects of trans fats, and in 2006, the FDA mandated the inclusion of trans-fat warning labels on food packages.
Willett said he thinks ignoring petition on soda consumption would be a grave mistake by the FDA—one that could affect youth health especially.
“What’s really happening on the ground is that a whole generation of children are being barraged by promotion to drink these beverages and consumption has gone way up,” said Willett.
Clarifying or imposing restrictions on sugar quantities will not impinge upon the public’s right to make their own nutritional choices, added Willett. Instead, he said, it will give members of society the “choice of living a healthy life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Congressional lawmakers attempt to hammer out a compromise on federal spending before automatic budget cuts kick in on Friday, Harvard Kennedy School professor Joseph E. Aldy is proposing his own way of reducing the federal budget deficit—eliminating subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.
In a research paper published this month, Aldy suggests that abolishing 12 tax provisions subsidizing fossil fuel production could reduce the federal deficit by as much as $41 billion over the next 10 years.
According to Aldy, a professor of public policy, over $4 billion of tax expenditures are transferred from taxpayers to fossil fuel producers every year.
Aldy’s proposal is one of many papers submitted by experts from the public and private sectors as part of an initiative by the Hamilton Project, a think tank in Washington D.C.
Aldy and others were asked to “provide innovative, pragmatic proposals for lowering the deficit by reducing expenditures of raising revenues,” according to the institution’s website.
In addition to reducing the federal budget deficit, Aldy argues in his paper that the absence of subsidies will reduce fossil fuel producers’ relative business advantage and potentially lower global fuel prices.
“Implementing this proposal will contribute to a leveling of the playing field among oil and gas companies...and will promote the efficiency in allocating capital across the U.S. economy,” wrote Aldy in his paper.
“Removal [of the subsidies] will not materially increase retail fuel prices, reduce employment, or weaken U.S. energy security,” he added.
According to Kennedy School professor and environmental economist Robert N. Stavins, interest groups such as owners of coal and natural gas companies have upheld the subsidies, despite their widely known distortionary effects.
“Subsidies in general are a problem,” Stavins said.
In addition to increasing economic efficiency in the U.S., Aldy said he believes the policy can encourage other countries to phase out their own fossil fuel consumption subsidies—a move that would in turn lower U.S. oil prices.
Stavins affirmed the policy’s global relevance, saying that the largest subsidies are in the world’s large, developing countries such as China and India.
“Developing countries want to keep fuels at low price for the population and direct transfers to low-income people,” Stavins said. “They want to spread the use of energy in the economy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday evening, a team of faculty, staff, and students from across the University will gather in Lowell House to present their field research on a Hindu festival that is widely purported to be the largest gathering of humans in the world.
Last month, more than 50 Harvard researchers traveled to Allahabad, India, to study the Kumbh Mela, a two-month-long religious affair that attracts tens of millions of visitors to a rotating location in India every three years.
At the festival, teams composed of members from Harvard’s various schools conducted research on urbanization, public health, economics, religious performance, poverty, and crowd management as part of a yearlong coordinated by the South Asia Institute and the Harvard Global Health Institute,
Now, a month after finishing their fieldwork, they are currently reflecting on their trip and drawing up plans to consolidate their research in palpable ways.
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
For most researchers who journeyed to India for the Kumbh Mela project, work began long before the festival started in January.
Last summer, Graduate School of Design professor Rahul J. Mehrotra, principal investigator of his School’s team, began working with his researchers to monitor the construction of the festival. For each Kumbh Mela, organizers build a tent-city in a matter of weeks to accommodate the millions of pilgrims who attend.
“We have been following the emergence of the city from its inception to its establishment and operation,” Mehrotra wrote in an email.
Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck, who specializes in the sacred geography of India, taught a course in the South Asian Studies department this past fall centered on the Kumbh Mela in preparation for the research project.
“We did as much reading and study of the Kumbh Mela as possible,” said Eck, who was one of the main leaders of the Harvard trip. “The course in the fall was a way of attracting students who might be interested.”
Eck said the sheer size and complexity of the festival necessitated such advance planning.
THINKING ACROSS DISCIPLINES
Though the focus of each researcher’s work differed based on individual interests, students and faculty alike said that interdisciplinary collaboration enhanced their work at the Kumbh Mela.
“One of the things that this [project] has really exemplified is that there are many things that you can study that are going to be better studied if you are looking at it with people from other disciplines and other schools,” Eck said.
For many undergraduates who went on the trip, the opportunity to work with researchers across many disciplines was the main highlight of their experience at the festival.
Brenna K. McDuffie ’15, a South Asian Studies concentrator who took Eck’s class, had never conducted formal research before going on the trip.
“Being part of this greater research group, regardless of what you’re studying, what your interests are, how much background you have on the Kumbh...for me, that was just an amazing experience,” said McDuffie, who conducted research on cultural performances and other religious rituals. “I think any Harvard student would have benefited from that.”
McDuffie and other undergraduates were given a great deal of freedom to suit their on-site research to their own academic and personal interests, Eck said.
“We [allowed] them free reign to develop their own interests in what they imagined would be their end...then to track it down once we got there,” Eck said.
Students from some of the graduate schools, however, approached their research at the Kumbh Mela from a somewhat different standpoint—one that focused on specific projects that were directly relevant to their professional studies and that often had real-world applications in India.
The Graduate School of Design team, for example, mapped the festival’s city using both two- and three-dimensional media to explore issues of urban design.
Likewise, Nicolas J. Roth, a graduate student in the Department of South Asian Studies, focused his research at the Kumbh Mela on environment and developmental organizations—a topic he said was closely tied to his ongoing academic research on South Asian religious rituals associated with trees.
“I was particularly looking at some of the campaigns around trees, tree planting, and tree preservation,” said Roth.
LOOKING FORWARD
Though they are now back in Cambridge, researchers say their work on the Kumbh Mela is far from finished.
The Graduate School of Design research team, for example, currently meets once every week to discuss its work in a seminar format.
The team also plans to give a public presentation on its research in the first week of April.
Those who took Eck’s class last fall will write research papers based on their work at the Kumbh Mela. And at Sunday’s meeting, researchers will reunite to further discuss their ideas.
“We will be doing a collective presentation and hope our work can be used in future collaborative projects,” said Rachel M. Taylor ’15, who focused her field research on the market flow of marigolds, roses, and chrysanthemums at the Kumbh Mela.
Using this meeting as a starting point, many of the researchers from the different professional schools will go over their work together in the coming months.
The project is expected to continue into the summer and perhaps even beyond.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team won a game in Jadwin Gymnasium, Tommy Amaker—who had finished college eight months earlier—was a graduate assistant for Mike Krzyzewski at Duke, and none of the players he currently coaches had been born.
So it has certainly been a while since February 3, 1989—the last time the Crimson left Princeton victorious.
On Friday, Harvard is faced with that daunting test once again, and the stakes have almost never been higher.
With four games remaining on its schedule, the Crimson (17-7, 9-1 Ivy) sits 1.5 games ahead of the Tigers (14-9, 7-2) in the Ivy League standings.
If Harvard can win on ESPNU, it would move within one victory of clinching at least a share of its third consecutive Ivy League title and two wins within clinching the championship outright.
Because the Crimson will be a significant favorite in its final three games—at Penn and home against Cornell and Columbia—a victory against Princeton would mark a giant step towards a second consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance for the squad. But if the Tigers win, they too will control their own destiny for a title share, setting up the possibility of the second one-game playoff between the two teams in the last three years.
“I’m really excited, and I know our team’s excited,” sophomore wing Wesley Saunders said. “Whenever we play Princeton, it’s a great atmosphere. It’s always going to be a great game.”
The last time the two teams met, on Feb. 16 at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard—which saw five players score in double-digits—knocked off the Tigers, 69-57. But earning a victory on the road will be an entirely different animal.
“The excitement, the energy I’m sure is going to be as high as we’ve seen all year, and it should be,” Amaker said. “We’ll be confident, but we know it’s going to be a tremendous challenge.”
If Harvard is going to conquer that challenge, it will need to find a way to contain Princeton forward Ian Hummer, who ranks second in the conference with 16.1 points and fifth with 6.3 rebounds per game.
He, along with Saunders, is one of the two contenders for Ivy League Player of the Year. And for the second straight meeting, Hummer will be defended by the sophomore, on whom he has two inches and often tried to post up in their last matchup.
“Hummer is as good of a player as we’ll face all season,” Amaker said. “We’ve got to make it hard for him, see if we can not give him easy baskets in the post.... I think that’s the key—you’re not bailing him out. You’ve got to really compete against him.”
“He does have a height advantage, but it’s a good challenge,” added Saunders, who averages a league-high 16.7 points per game. “I think it should be fun.”
Another point of emphasis will be three-point defense against Princeton’s bevy of shooters, led by 6’10” forward Will Barrett, who has hit a league-high 52.1 percent of his long balls. Sophomore guard Denton Koon, who has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 14 games, is also a dangerous perimeter threat.
“They have some really good shooters,” Saunders said. “We really need to focus on trying to limit their attempts at threes.”
On the offensive end, Amaker emphasized that it would be critical to get off to a fast start on the road. Facing what he called “maybe the tallest starting five in the country,” the coach said he could often choose to play two of his three big men—sophomores Kenyatta Smith, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Jonah Travis—at the same time, something he has been reluctant to do this season.
Harvard’s Ivy-best three-point shooting, led by co-captains Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster and freshman Siyani Chambers, will also need to be on point against the squad that has allowed a league-low 57.0 points per game.
“It’s going to be a team effort the whole way around,” Saunders said. “We’re just going to have to go out and do it together.”
If it can do just that, a win at Jadwin would mark another significant milestone for a program that has experienced many over the past few seasons.
“[I’ve told the team], let’s do something cool that this team can hang its hat on,” Amaker said. “Like never winning an Ivy title, it’s one of those weird things. We got that off the plate, and maybe at some point, hopefully on Friday, we’ll get this off the plate [as well].”
For Saunders, that is a very appealing goal.
“It’s an opportunity for us to step up,” he said. “It’s a good test to measure our improvement over the year.... Hopefully we can go down there and finally get a win. Hopefully we can make some history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ivy League basketball will get some decent exposure this weekend, with two games set to air on national television. The players will receive the vast majority of the attention, and rightly so, but I’d like to take a moment to give it up for those other Ivy students ready for their moment in the spotlight: the fans.
It’s one of the things that makes college basketball different from the pro game—a condensed atmosphere filled with (sometimes) well-lubricated college students looking to burn off a little stress. Our own columnist, Catherine E. Coppinger, captured “the racket” that was the decidedly unfriendly atmosphere at Payne Whitney Gymnasium on Saturday, complete with angry bros and naughty chants. Princeton and Penn, the traditional powers of the conference, can always be counted on to create raucous home atmospheres, and Harvard is starting to approach their level. Take a gander at a few “I Believe” YouTube videos from Lavietes Pavilion if you’re not convinced.
Even lowly Brown, sitting at sixth place in the Ivy standings, can get rowdy on occasion. The Bears lost to Harvard on Friday despite the best efforts of their rabid student section, which I had the privilege of witnessing in person. Though held silent for much of the first 30 minutes by the miserable product on display—going 1-for-14 from three with 19 turnovers can do that to a crowd—the Brown faithful was quickly whipped into a frenzy by an on-court t-shirt giveaway. A mini-hoop dunk contest featuring three local eight-year-olds further emboldened the Bear Den, until its members felt confident enough to lob a series of taunts at a follically challenged member of Harvard’s squad: “RO-GAINE, RO-GAINE,” and “A-A-R-P!” among them. Inspiring stuff.
Oh, the wonderful freedom granted by diffusion of responsibility, allowing us to feel morally indifferent to loudly and rudely criticizing the manner in which someone pursues his or her passion. Would I ever belt out a “You’re terrible!” during a chemist’s struggles with a stubborn strand of messenger RNA? If I was in the midst of a crowd of other screaming apes, I just might.
YALE at COLUMBIA
You’ve got to give Yale forward Brandon Sherrod a lot of credit for not quitting the game of basketball after Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders’ posterizing thunder dunk nearly killed him. It takes quite a bit of strength to internalize and come to grips with that sequence of events: “I was a victim of the most mortifying play my sport has to offer in front of friends and family at the hands of my archrival. It was then viewed across the country on an immensely popular television program. And I’m okay with that.” Sherrod’s mental resilience was further on display later in the game when he picked up a technical foul for clapping in the face of Crimson point guard Siyani Chambers after blocking his shot.
Pick: Yale
BROWN at CORNELL
It’s a two-game road trip for the Bears, which generally portends two disastrous losses. Brown is 3-10 on the road this year, as compared to a surprisingly decent 7-4 home record. Perhaps the Bears owe their relative success at the Pizzitola Sports Center to those aforementioned students. Unfortunately, no self-respecting human would dare venture too deep into Ithaca without a compelling reason, and spectating at an insignificant basketball game just fails to qualify.
Pick: Cornell
DARTMOUTH at PENN
The Palestra has hosted prouder matchups than this one. Show some respect, Dartmouth. At least take your boots off before you come on the floor.
Pick: Penn
HARVARD at PRINCETON
I don’t think I’ll get much resistance when I say this is the most important game of the Ivy season. The game will be televised on ESPNU, which is a bad omen, if you’re into that sort of thing. Harvard has yet to break the “Curse of ESPN,” losing every game it has ever played on the Worldwide Leader’s family of television networks. Maybe that’s because ESPN will only air Ivy games it knows will be extremely competitive. Or maybe it’s witchcraft.
Pick: Princeton
DARTMOUTH at PRINCETON
Dartmouth. Dartmouth, Dartmouth, Dartmouth. You will lose this game by so many points. Your only chance is for Princeton-Harvard to go into 30 overtimes so you can play the ball boys. Princeton-Harvard will not go into 30 overtimes.
Pick: Princeton
YALE at CORNELL
At one point in the Ivy season, this game might have mattered. Yale and Cornell beat up on the dregs of the Ancient Eight enough that their supporters were deluded into thinking they might challenge for the title. Now they’re duking it out for third and (maybe!) a bid to the Collegeinsider.com Postseason Tournament, or, as it’s colloquially known, March Sadness.
Pick: Cornell
BROWN at COLUMBIA
You mean GameDay isn’t coming to this one? Someone get Rece Davis on the phone, pronto.
Pick: Columbia
HARVARD at PENN
I don’t believe that the “trap game” as a real, persistent phenomenon actually exists, but you can be sure the term will figure into the narrative for this contest. Win or lose, Harvard will have expended quite a bit of sweat and emotion the night before against Princeton, ostensibly making them more likely to underperform against a lesser Penn team. You think your hero is going to fall into that humdrum journalistic sludge? No, sir. The Crimson will win this game through superior basketball performance, not because Tommy Amaker fed them pregame bowls of fortitude stew.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One down, two to go.
Before the start of the 2012-13 season, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (21-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) set its sights on bringing home the program’s first national title since 1999. The Crimson took a big step toward achieving its ultimate goal Tuesday, earning a share of the Ivy League championship with a 3-1 win over Yale. It was the team’s first title share since 2009.
“It’s awesome,” said freshman Mary Parker, who scored two goals Tuesday. “The seniors have been…explaining how much it means to us, so even though I haven’t been able to experience it before, it was just as exciting.”
Next up on Harvard’s checklist is claiming its first ECAC title since 2008. The Crimson will start navigating the eight-team field with a best-of-three series against Dartmouth on Friday.
“Now it’s on to the postseason, where everybody starts 0-0 and works their way from there,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids have had a tremendous season, and hopefully we can do some damage in the postseason.”
To date, the Crimson has played two wildly different games against the Big Green.
At the Bright Hockey Center in November, the Crimson crushed Dartmouth, 6-0. Three Harvard players scored three points each, and co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded 26 saves in the shutout win.
In the February rematch, Bellamy saw 26 shots again, but was only able to stop 24 of them as the two teams skated to a 2-2 draw on Dartmouth’s home ice.
“In the first game, everything just sort of went our way,” Stone said. “The second game was just a great hockey game. We had lots of chances, they had good chances, goaltenders played well on both sides. I like the matchup a lot—two good teams trying to score goals, that makes for exciting hockey.”
Since that second Big Green matchup, Harvard has struggled through the toughest stretch of its schedule, going 4-3-1 against competition that included three teams currently ranked in the top five.
“We’ve played a lot of hockey,” Stone said. “We’re resilient, we’ve been able to focus and stay in the moment, and hopefully we can keep doing that this weekend.”
During that stretch, the Crimson has dealt with a lack of scoring from co-captain Jillian Dempsey, who still leads the team with 23 goals. Dempsey has not found the back of the net in the last eight games. Her longest previous goal drought this season was two games.
“She’s working hard, she’s doing the things for us off the puck that we really need, she just has a tremendous work ethic,” Stone said. “She just has to keep doing all the other things, and when she gets good looks at the net, I’m sure things will happen.”
Harvard was also forced to play three games without junior first-line forward Kalley Armstrong, who missed a week of action while trying to get healthy before the playoffs before returning to the ice Tuesday.
With Armstrong out and Dempsey struggling, several Crimson players took advantage of their extra responsibilities. Parker and sophomore Hillary Crowe each have accrued four goals in the last month of play, as many as either of them had to that point in the season. Sophomore Samantha Reber and freshmen Dylanne Crugnale and Jessica Harvey have also upped their levels of contribution.
“That’s what you are looking for,” Stone said. “One situation may not be as hot, another gets hot, and that’s hockey, and that’s why you want to have a lot of depth. We feel like we have that, and that’s what we are looking for—a comprehensive team effort.”
While Harvard has proven its skating depth, questions have emerged about the goaltending duo of Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer. Stout for much of the year, the netminders saw their save percentage drop from .959 and .936 to .912 and .921, respectively, from January to February.
For the first time in her young college career, Maschmeyer was pulled following the first period against Clarkson last weekend after giving up two early goals, including one that got by her with less than a second left on the clock. Bellamy finished that game and played the entirety of the contest against Yale.
“The thinking there was that [Bellamy] came in and did well over the weekend in the Clarkson game,” Stone said. “We will take it one step at a time through the weekend.”
If the Crimson is able to beat Dartmouth twice, it would travel to the highest-remaining seed for single-elimination semifinal and final rounds.

One culinary question you'll never hear debated is where in the United States to go for a bagel. The supremacy of the New York bagel is a closed case—an accepted tenet of foodie-ism that is about as up for discussion as Avogadro's number.
After I decided to come to Harvard, my mom bought me an enormous winter coat. But I was less concerned about Cambridge winters than I was about the prospect of being out of reach of a decent bagel. I went my entire first semester at college without attempting to fill the void. But positive experiences with Cambridge sushi and Cambridge pizza gave me a ray of hope. This week, Connie and I attempted to do the impossible: find a bagel worth eating within walking distance of Harvard Yard.
JP Licks:   Let's get one thing straight—thank God JP Licks makes ice cream. After the first bite of our cinnamon raisin bagel, it was all we could do not to demand we be given back each of our 109 cents. Why? A near twin to the stiff, rounded bread they're serving up is available for free at Annenberg. Actually, it is an insult to d-hall bagels to claim that this attempt was d-hall quality. It wasn't. Sinking our teeth into the dryness of the bagel was an experience so devoid of poetry it doesn't deserve a simile. Happily, our suffering was short-lived: we shuffled out the door, careful to avoid making eye contact with the cashier who had eyed us suspiciously as we made faces at our food.
VERDICT: It goes without saying, we crowned no bagel baron at this establishment.
Gato Rojo:  We asked the barista where they got their bagels (Danish Pastry Company). Maybe we should have asked where they bought their toaster. The plain bagel we were served was a little on the dry side, and very thin by bagel standards, but oh my, what a toast! For a moment we were almost fooled into believing we had uncovered a superior product.
VERDICT: Maybe one's best option is horizontal integration: buy your bagel at a worthier venue (to be revealed); migrate to Gato for the toast. Otherwise, save your dollar—or invest in a pot of Gato tea!
Annenberg:  Early Wednesday morning, we went back to our roots and sampled an Annenberg bagel. We like to call it a stomach filler: the breakfast equivalent of the plain pasta that has taken up permanent residence on the "Love Your Heart" menu. And unlike at Gato Rojo, there is no magical toaster to redeem the sub-par product. But hey, if you jockey for a slot in the Annenberg toaster, you can at least say you had a hot breakfast. Not to mention a free one.
VERDICT: Just ok.
Panera/ABP:   We took a stab at the age-old question: what actually differentiates Panera from ABP? Well, we're stumped. Other than the fact that one plays elevator music at a significantly louder volume (Panera, this is not a club, turn it down), the chain cafés appear to be one and the same, particularly when it comes to bagels.
VERDICT: That's right. The bagels we sampled at both establishments tasted exactly the same. The asiago cheese bagel we picked up at Panera ($2.25 with cream cheese) was just more expensive than the $1.27 investment we made in the ABP jalapeno and cheese bagel.
Crema Café:   Crema Café, an eatery better known for its pastries, took the proverbial cake. At $2.80 a pop (cream cheese included), this is the priciest option.  However, for those stricken with a case of the bagel blues, it is a worthy investment. This bagel is as close an approximation of the classic New York bagel you're going to get on this side of the Hudson. It boasts a fluffy texture, and just the right level of chewiness. The morning we stopped by, the bagel-of-the-day was of the "everything" persuasion. (You might say it meant "everything" to us). Fair play, maybe not, but the oniony accouterments lent this particular contender an aroma and an added flavor which ensured that, when we returned the remnants to our brown bagel bag, it was the most decrepit among the survivors.
VERDICT: The best in the Square.
