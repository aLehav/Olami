After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students believe that they can defy gravity. We’ve convinced ourselves of it. That something special about us prevents natural forces from acting — that rules don’t apply.
I came to realize this in the depths of YouTube at some unreasonable hour one night. I found myself watching a clip of Conan O’Brien sitting in Sanders Theatre, claiming that fame is “removing gravity from people and allowing outrageous behavior.” He was cautioning students about the perils of success. Our obsession with it, he suggested, often compromises the gravity that should tether us so firmly: kindness and openness.
An “anything goes” sentiment is ubiquitous here. As Harvard students, we’re granted a small degree of fame and an excessive sense of entitlement. We strut down our Cambridge streets internalizing that we’re allowed (obligated even) to act any way necessary to further ourselves, whether that means forcing bonds for personal gain or discarding others that offer none.
Our ambition spills into social interactions which often become networking opportunities rather than genuine moments of connection. “How are you?” feels largely rhetorical because we’re so busy with our own pursuits, we care more about completing the transaction of asking than actually listening to the answer. And plus, a reply short of “good” puts us at risk of revealing fallibility.
Sometimes, it can feel as though we are conducting background checks on each other. Questions like “how did you get your internship?” or “what do your parents do?” are ones I have received multiple times when meeting peers for the first time. And after glossing over my interests and essentially my entire identity, their questions felt simultaneously invasive and impersonal. I wanted to believe this was casual conversation, but by the end, it felt like they knew everything about me without really knowing who I am.
Social validation was contingent on the very wording of my replies. I had to sum myself up, appealingly and convincingly, but not necessarily organically or even genuinely at times. I was left wondering why I had to keep proving myself. Even if I was confident about my accomplishments and didn’t feel the need to flaunt them, I had to continuously regurgitate impressive pre-packaged answers to self-advertise — to succinctly communicate “I’m worth being around.”
But as Harvard students, weren’t we all gravity-less by default? Apparently not.
Our network-oriented ecosystem affords transparency and humility little merit, punishing and exposing those whom gravity still grounds. Those who defy gravity don’t want to be weighed down by those who don’t.
But in orchestrating our personal interactions like this, we forsake so much. We miss out on just letting things happen and forging bonds over shared passions or wonderfully strange idiosyncrasies. College is a place where, ideally, we discover what we’re good at, find purpose, and meet different kinds of people. But in an endless pursuit to feel important (gravityless, that is), we readily forget these pursuits are ongoing. We feel obligated to have everything figured out right now, and we look down on those who aren’t projecting this image.
Our time in Cambridge is a unique opportunity to be lost. Wandering, even though it doesn’t sound that impressive, is a privilege. We shouldn’t have to calculate every move and interaction in the frantic scramble for personal gain. We shouldn’t feel the need to wield our skills like weapons and shield ourselves from insecurity or uncertainty. Most of all, we shouldn’t have to reduce ourselves to our ability to market ourselves because of the looming threat of social disqualification.
Watching YouTube videos, for example, sounds like a waste of time. Most of the time, it is. And it’s something that I do more often than I care to admit. But it was this moment of procrastination, of putting off my fancy internship work, that I let myself laugh at Conan’s nonsense and let my mind wander to thoughts that were just as important. With this, I’m not suggesting we abandon our ambitions and all sense of direction, but that we have everything to gain from seeing productivity and success manifest themselves in traditionally unadvertised ways. The kindness that comes with this openness not only grounds us but also displays a sense of self-worth far more authentic than the arrogance for which we so often opt. And while I don’t expect networking to disappear, reducing Harvard to a transaction is wasteful. Our bragging-judging exchange, ironically, only cuts us short; it limits us to what we’ve done rather than what we could be.
We need to stop proving ourselves and trust that we are worthy. Let’s even permit ourselves to meander, quietly if we want. But most importantly, let’s remember that we all deserve to be here, which means we don’t need to defy the force of gravity. So let’s all be just a little more human and allow ourselves to stay grounded instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The situation in Afghanistan is a growing asylum and refugee crisis that is testing not only the international refugee resettlement system but each American’s humanity and ability to take action in the face of injustice and a divided nation. A system of pillage and proxy wars that we partly created was behind horrific scenes of thousands of panicked Afghans gathered at the Kabul airport, handing out their babies or clinging to U.S. Air Force planes. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than a half-million Afghans have been internally displaced since the beginning of 2021. The United Nations is urging states to respect the core principle of the 1951 Refugee Convention — non-refoulment — where refugees should not be returned to places where they would be at risk.
We all can and must refuse the dehumanization of the Afghan refugees and internally displaced persons we left behind and ask for tangible, immediate actions by our government and citizens. The ask is not to “humanize” Afghan refugees when they arrive at our clinics and neighborhoods since we can only “humanize” those who are not fully human. Moreover, the reduction of Afghan people to victims and refugees to be saved by white saviors is dangerous and fundamentally unfair. The ask is to pause during these trying times and ask ourselves how it is that some of us have failed to see the already present full humanity of those seeking refuge and to realize our responsibility towards them.
In terms of immediate action, there is a shortage of medical care in Afghanistan which, according to the World Health Organization, includes reproductive and child health. We must advocate for aid entry into the country while the situation unfolds. Also, more direct aid is needed for organizations working in Afghanistan. Women for Afghan Women is providing “safe shelter, resources, and aid to the thousands of women, children, families, and staff” and the International Medical Corps is working to secure emergency relief funds. The Afghan American Foundation has compiled a list of verified organizations that are directly working with Afghans.
Most importantly, although America’s military presence ended on Aug. 31, the U.S. has processed only 8,000 Special Immigrant Visas this past week from Afghanistan, whose population size is almost 39 million. It is our duty to contact our local government officials and advocate for the expansion of the SIV program. As we increase the number of Afghan refugees allowed and remove quotas, we must also advocate for the reinstatement of the Temporary Protected Status, a governmental status for select countries in crisis that allows incomers to live and work in the U.S. As American cities receive SIV refugees and many more initiate resettlement mechanisms, local resettlement agencies will be in dire need of volunteer support.
At Harvard, we must collaborate with local partners to welcome and assist refugees throughout their transition. In the long term, there is an urgent need to produce more research focusing on understanding and bettering the health of refugees. Recent evidence is showing that the health of refugees and their offspring deteriorates over time after they are resettled in the U.S. This is contrary to what is seen in other immigrants who have lower mortality and morbidity rates compared to those in the hosting country, a phenomenon known as the “healthy migrant effect”. We still do not understand well why this happens and how to reduce health disparities among refugees. We must leverage our research partnerships and scholarship with communities directly impacted by this crisis and demand that philanthropists, foundations, and donors in the U.S. support refugee-health research, which we normally struggle to fund. We, at Harvard, are well-positioned to lead such research and partner with other research institutions in regions where refugees are resettled.
As healthcare professionals of Middle Eastern heritage, we understand the intergenerational trauma related to being a refugee. We understand that achieving health equity for refugees requires solidarity and multi-sectoral action. As healthcare and public health providers, we must expand our interpreter capacities, work with local resettlement agencies on health screenings and vaccinations for new incoming refugees, and refresh our trauma-informed care approaches. The dialogue about forced migration and its impact on the mental and physical health of future generations of refugees is extremely timely and important and should take place at our clinics, institutions, and homes.
At this time, it is easy to blame politicians for the Afghan disaster and let this pass by as another political failure. But we challenge what we can do, as Americans, and academics more precisely, to aid Afghans and welcome refugees. From donating to advocacy to research, there is much we can do. Our collective consciousness depends on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was the toddler who told my actual age when my parents wanted to get kiddie discounts at restaurants and events. I was that little kid who said precisely what she was thinking about anything and anyone. I was the little girl who didn’t want to be a princess. Unironically, I grew up to be the girl that was unafraid to use her voice whenever, wherever, and however she saw fit. It became, essentially, one of the most overt parts of my personality as I grew through adolescence and into young adulthood — until I started losing my voice.
I lose my voice when I’m tired. My vocal cords flare up from overuse and irritation, prohibiting the normally full, commanding, and throaty frequencies from reaching the tip of my tongue. And while I strain to preserve the presence of the most precious instrument in my justice-for-Kyla-and-all-the-little-black-girls-like-her symphony, all that is left is a hoarse, cracking, lilting melody.
The fullness of my voice often masks the exhaustion and concealed pain from what sometimes feels like the weight of a cruel world — particularly for Black women. And so, in every space, the notes that leave my mouth must be strong. It must be unfaltering during classroom and friendly introductions, fierce in protest and mighty while fighting against injustices, and yet cheery with those I love. Until I lose my voice again — and the strength that came with it seems as though it has slipped away.
It’s in these moments I feel weak, defenseless, without my natural guard that protects the sanctity of my doctrine of forthrightness. It’s where I feel an unfulfilled duty to the little black girl that always demanded the world hear her clearly. But in my silence and between the cracks of my voice — despite how eerily hollow and shaken it may seem — I’ve found solace in an unshielded tune.
Sometimes I don’t want to be strong. Sometimes I can’t.
I am constantly tired — for a number of reasons. I am reckoning with a year of change and isolation as well as the mental residue left in its place. I am mourning loved ones and experiences lost. I am adjusting to the semi-post-pandemic return to outside as I attempt to recall being an in-person student, friend, and family member. I am learning how to be a real-time college kid for the first time here at Harvard. I’m practicing getting good at being bad. I’m battling the complexities of misogynoir. I am praying night and day for the victims of white supremacy and for those of us left behind to continue the fight against it.
My body is weary. My mind is scattered. As a result, I’m left to bend to the will of high-pitched cracks, a hushed rasp, and even a bodily-enforced silence.
There’s a vulnerability in the shaking breathiness of the notes from vocal cords strained.  To be honest, I never liked it. The unsureness of the ability to create another sound and the discomfort in a lack of audible conviction can thrust you into a perpetual quietness until the confidence of a sonorous voice returns. But losing my voice in moments of anxiety, inundation, and restlessness has shown me the power — and the necessity — in having the courage to admit the moments when I’m not the strong Black woman everybody, including myself, has made me out to be.
Losing my voice forces me to slow down. To listen in the ways I hope to be listened to. To rest when the going gets tough. What’s more is establishing the trust in others to speak up for me when I’m bound, with me as allies, and to me in the spaces between. After all, the added harmony of those who help me fill the silence while I embrace the uneasiness during times of strain produces the most exquisite sound.
I am a Black woman who — like anyone else — has moments of strength and moments when I’ve lost my voice. Too often, though, has the world convinced me that my value is fixed in my ability to defend myself incessantly, to fight for others intensely, and to maintain the perfect pitch as my larynx swells.
So every time I lose my voice, I’m reminded that the symphony I had begun to craft as a little Black girl is only fuller with all its notes — even the hushed, the shaken, and cracked ones — because the world will still hear that little girl and all that she is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David F. M. Brown, the current chair of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, will become the next president of MGH on Sept. 8.
Mass General Brigham, the hospital network encompassing MGH and several other local hospitals, announced Monday that it had selected Brown to succeed Harvard Medical School professor of health care policy Peter L. Slavin ’79, who announced his departure in April following 18 years of leadership at MGH. Brown is also set to serve as an Executive Vice President at Mass General Brigham.
In addition to serving as chair of emergency medicine since 2013, Brown has received multiple awards for his advancement of numerous research and educational efforts at MGH.
As chair of the Executive Committee on Teaching and Education and Mass General Brigham’s Academic Head of the Harvard Affiliated Emergency Medicine Residency, Brown oversaw educational initiatives for clinicians, scientists, and policy experts. Brown has also been involved with the hospital’s administrative affairs and multiple system-wide efforts, including committees on senior appointments, education, and hospital leadership searches.
Brown also has been involved with health equity initiatives, and has treated inpatients and outpatients in multiple Boston neighborhoods. He is also a co-founder and an inaugural board member of Mass General Brigham Urgent Care, which serves nine locations across the region.
Anne Klibanski, President and CEO of Mass General Brigham, noted Brown’s dedication and leadership within MGH in a press release, citing his “deep and proven commitment” and “clear vision” of the hospital’s advancement in patient-centered research and care.
This announcement comes a few weeks after Brigham and Women’s Hospital named a new president, Robert S. D. Higgins, the current Surgeon-in-Chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital and director of the surgery department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Higgins, alongside Brown, will also serve as an Executive Vice President at Mass General Brigham effective December.
Klibanski wrote in an Aug. 19 press release that Higgins is a “proven innovator” who is the “ideal choice” to lead the hospital through a prolonged public health crisis. Higgins is an established authority in heart and lung transplantation, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and mechanical circulatory support.
Higgins will succeed Elizabeth G. “Betsy” Nabel, who left her role as Brigham and Women’s president early this year to become Executive Vice President for Strategy at ModeX Therapeutics.

Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein will serve as the president of the Organization of Harvard University Chaplains after being selected by more than 30 other chaplains of different faiths.
As president, Epstein will act as the coordinator and intermediary with the Harvard administration for the various religious groups on campus. He will join a lineage of Rabbis, Lutheran ministers, Evangelicals, Catholic priests, and a host of leaders from other faiths.
Humanism is a philosophy that centers around the goodness of humanity, rather than divinity; humanists do not believe in a god. Epstein has served as Harvard’s Humanist Chaplain since 2005.
A small nominating committee of chaplains across the University decides which of the Harvard University chaplains will be put forth for election. Committee members speak to potential candidates to ask for their consent to be involved in the selection process, and if the nominee agrees to stand for election, their name is presented to the wider group of chaplains for a verbal vote.
Epstein was elected unanimously by his peers.
In an interview, Epstein said his role as president will not entail dictating the beliefs or teachings of other chaplains and faith leaders. Instead, he said he plans to collaborate closely with other religious groups by holding meaningful interfaith discussions and coming to a consensus on important campus issues.
“As president, my job is really to point out the incredible vibrancy of all the programs that my fellow chaplains are engaging in,” he said.
He added that he will take on a facilitatory and managerial role through chairing monthly plenary meetings and performing other administrative tasks. Under his leadership, religious groups will continue to operate in a decentralized way.
“There’s just so much great work that goes on in any given year with all these different religious and spiritual and ethical communities, where each of the communities is very much independent and does not rely on any other community or on any official like myself,” Epstein said.
The plurality of the Harvard chaplaincy can be fruitful for campus life, he added.
“It’s really amazing that Harvard has this resource of all of these different chaplains providing life and inspiration from all these different perspectives,” Epstein said.
Senior Catholic Chaplain William T. Kelly said the election process benefits from the many different backgrounds and perspectives represented in the chaplaincy.
“There is, in general, a real respect for one another. We all recognize that we really are attending to something very important to the lives of the University,” Kelly said. “We do help one another to do that well.”
Kelly said the chaplains mainly choose a president who is “willing to put in the time” for the administrative position and said he believes Epstein is “very capable in his field.”
In response to recent media coverage on Epstein’s election, which has largely focused on Epstein’s humanist philosophy, the Harvard Catholic Chaplains released a statement emphasizing the administrative nature of the presidency.
Kelly said he believes some media outlets have provided a “sensational” approach to covering Epstein.
“In the secular press and some of the newspapers, I think there’s been a misinterpretation,” Kelly said. “I don’t think it has adequately been corrected that the role of the president does not have a determining factor on the direction of what the Harvard chaplaincy does.”
“I think it’s been given a kind of sensational sense. You put the words ‘Harvard’ and ‘chaplain’ in the same sentence: it’s going to get people’s attention,” he added.
During his tenure, Epstein said he is looking forward to working with the other chaplains to concretize the priorities of religious groups at the University to address the lasting impacts of the pandemic on Harvard affiliates.
“What I’m focused on is just ensuring that all of these different groups from all of their different perspectives have support from me and have a good opportunity to support each other,” Epstein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of Zooming into classes from across the world, Harvard undergraduates walked into classrooms Wednesday to start their fall courses.
“It felt so good to be back in the classroom,” Harini S. Kannan ’24 said. “I have missed that feeling so much.”
For Kannan, who resides in the Quad, one of the challenges was getting to her 9 a.m. class — she took the Allston Loop shuttle to reach the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston for Engineering Sciences 53: “Quantitative Physiology as a Basis for Bioengineering,” an introductory bioengineering course. Still, it was worth the trip, she said.
“It felt really good to pay attention, and sit in front of someone who’s teaching you — it really honestly brought back the joy of learning,” she said.
Grace J. Kim ’25 said her first course, Art, Film, and Visual Studies 40A: “Introduction to Still Photography,” was initially intimidating because of the large proportion of seniors, but compelling nonetheless.
“The photography one was really exciting,” Kim said.
Despite many students’ excitement about in-person classes, some continued to leverage the benefits of online learning to work around scheduling conflicts. Kim’s photography course conflicted partially with Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” — one of the most popular classes at Harvard — and reverted to virtual learning for the latter.
“[AFVS 40A] was a smaller class, and the CS50 one was the complete opposite,” Kim said.
Freshmen also saw their first chance to enroll in historically popular courses. Jonathan D. May ’25 began his first year at the College with Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” — another course with consistently high enrollment rates — jointly taught by professors Jason Furman ’92 and David I. Laibson ’88.
Despite their formidable academic reputations, May said Furman and Laibson were approachable and made the learning environment comfortable and engaging.
“It was crazy to see how accomplished the Economics professors were, but also how fun they made the class,” he said. “They were super energetic.”
May said he was looking forward to Expository Writing 20 because of its smaller enrollment size, which he hoped would allow for increased interactions between students and stronger relationships.
“Expos 20 was great because it was a smaller class,” he said. “I feel like I’ll be able to get tighter with that community, and it’s really nice to have support in writing because I feel like it’s going to be so different.”
Students said they enjoyed the components of the in-person campus experience, including connecting with fellow students and mentoring underclassmen. Allison Tu ’23, who studied remotely last year, said common undergraduate activities like grabbing breakfast in Annenberg had newfound meaning post-quarantine.
“It was ridiculously crowded this morning because there’s so many freshmen, and everyone was eating breakfast,” she said. “It was really fun to be back because I hadn’t eaten a meal there forever.”
Tu, who is a Peer Advising Fellow, said she also enjoyed getting to know and advise her PAFees in person.
“They’re wonderful, and it’s so exciting to PAF in person,” she said. “Last year, it was virtual — I still loved my students and it was a good experience, but it’s just so different getting to do it in person.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 2, 2021 at 6:00 p.m. 
Hundreds of students filed into the Science and Engineering Complex in Allston on Wednesday, the first day the eight-story steel building — more than five years and $1 billion in the making — hosted lectures and seminars.
Students who traveled across the river for classes Wednesday, the first day of the academic year, had largely positive reviews for the 544,000-square-foot complex, which features Active Learning Labs, greenspace terraces, and a “clubhouse” for student groups to work on engineering projects.
Brayan H. Romero said that while he thinks the outside of the building “doesn’t have too much attraction,” he was impressed by its interior, and noted the complex’s proximity to the Harvard Innovation Labs, an institution that promotes student entrepreneurship.
Jakob A. N. Troidl, a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, agreed with Romero, adding that he believes the complex's openness encourages collaboration and creativity.
“Inside here, it seems like a place that you want to stay with friends, and a lot of innovation can be done here,” he said. “The floor arrangement and everything feels like it’s designed to bump into people.”
Mohib A. Jafri ’23 spent his Wednesday evening sitting in a lecture hall at the SEC attending Computer Science 242: “Computing at Scale.” Jafri, who studies electrical engineering, declared the complex a “huge upgrade” from the old SEAS classrooms at Maxwell Dworkin and Pierce Hall, located north of Harvard Yard.
“This space lends itself to a more human, happier environment,” he said. “Just the amount of light coming in and out like that makes an average class be a bit more peppy, a little less depressing than going into a basement.”
Though SEAS and Harvard intended to have the complex ready for students’ use in fall 2020, construction delays and a citywide moratorium on construction due to the coronavirus pandemic pushed back the University’s timeline. Faculty began moving into the building in spring 2021, and it officially opened in August.
A cafe run by Harvard University Dining Services and a FlyBy station, where students can grab a bagged lunch without having to make the trek across the river, also opened in the SEC on Wednesday.
University shuttles, run by Harvard Campus Services, connect students from Harvard’s residential houses and other academic buildings to the SEC, which sits on the opposite bank of the Charles River. A new shuttle route, dubbed “Quad-SEC Direct,” includes stops at the SEC, Barry’s Corner, Harvard Stadium, Harvard Square, and the Quad. The existing Allston Campus Express shuttle, recently renamed the Allston Loop, has also added an SEC stop.
Nishant Mishra ’24, who attended Gen Ed 1033: “Conflict Resolution in a Divided World” at the SEC Wednesday evening, said he anticipates an easy commute from his Quincy House dorm room to class.
“There’s a stop right outside DeWolfe, so in the future, I expect it to be really convenient just to walk out and wait,” he said.
Some students, though, said they experienced overcrowded shuttles en route to their first classes at the SEC.
Jaxson T. Hill ’23, a Mechanical Engineering concentrator, said he hopes Harvard increases the number of shuttles running to the SEC to accommodate the between-class rush of students.
Jafri said he believes the size of the complex bodes well for the future of Harvard engineering.
“Right now it feels like the space is too big for us,” he said. “I see an upward vector for where engineering at Harvard is going to be.”

UPDATED: September 2, 2021 at 10:40 p.m. 
The Harvard Law School Class of 2024 is the most diverse in the school’s history, HLS announced Friday.
Fifty-six percent of current first-year Harvard Law students identify as people of color, and 54 percent identify as women, according to a press release published by the school.
Kristi Jobson ’06, assistant dean for admissions at Harvard Law School, said the entire school will benefit from the diversity of the class.
“Our entering students represent an incredible diversity of backgrounds and life experiences, adding to the richness and depth of our campus community,” Jobson said in the press release.
Law student Faith A. Jackson ’16, who serves as co-president of the Law Student Council, said she is “very excited” that the school is admitting “more and more diverse classes.”
Though Jackson said she believes it is important that America’s lawyers be diverse, she said she thinks the Law School should focus more on attracting a globally diverse student body.
“With a school that has found a lot of resources from the globe and produces leaders of the globe, I think it’s only fair that it reflects the globe, and I’m excited for us to get closer and closer to doing that,” Jackson said.
While Harvard Law applauded the diversity of its incoming class in the press release, it has long faced criticism among student activists for what they argue is insufficient course and faculty diversity.
Like peer institutions, Harvard Law School witnessed an upsurge in applicants this year. It accepted 6.9 percent of roughly 10,000 applications, according to the press release.
Current first-years at Harvard Law come from an array of professional backgrounds. Before arriving in Cambridge, they were educators, performers, writers, political campaign managers, and athletic coaches.

Dear Harvard Internet or Whatever Acronym You Call Yourself,
As I sit in Widener for the first time desperately hacking into my Crimson email, I can’t help but think that there could not be a nicer place for me to cry about my connectivity issues. In fact, you having connectivity issues is super helpful to me. As a sophomore who spent her entire last year taking classes online and has forgotten how to make meaningful social connections, it’s nice that you, too, have connection problems.
But there’s one thing that’s bothering me.
You know how I had to take classes and apply for internships and try to keep my sanity intact all last year and this year? Yeah, you my friend, only have one job.
So why don’t we go through why you suck.
Spotty data = LDR problems
I have multiple friends who live far away in the land known as the Radcliffe Quadrangle, so I need an internet connection to be able to communicate with them. Yesterday, I let my friend in Currier know that I was about to visit her as we had planned. I texted her at about 7:36 p.m., yet you took two hours to send the message to her. The entire time I was sitting around, wondering why she was not responding. Because of you, I became upset, nervous, and believed that she no longer wanted anything to do with me.
Also, commuting to the Quad is quite an ordeal. You know why? Because we need an internet connection to call for the evening van. Without the internet, I am left without options. It’s not like I can hail a cab, and it’s way too far to walk back to my cushy River House. So thanks to you, Harvard students are having a harder time connecting. I think we deserve better after a year online.
I cannot procrastinate in lecture
As someone who has no time management skills, I feel attacked that you would randomly stop working in the middle of lecture. During lecture, I like to do homework for other classes, play random games, message my friends that I somehow never find the time to meet up with, and basically do anything except pay attention to the lecture.
Of course, you had to ruin that for me as well. I had nothing left to do in lecture but fall asleep. How am I supposed to pretend that I am taking notes on my laptop if there is no internet and I fall asleep due to boredom? Because of you, I will be even more stretched for time. So if I fail all of my courses this semester, I know who to sue.
My meetings are useless
So you know how Harvard students like to have their silly little meetings about their silly little extracurricular activities and their silly little conferences and silly little consulting groups? Well, I had a club meeting yesterday, and there we were trying to take notes and edit Google Documents about our upcoming conference.
You know what the problem was? You weren’t working.
As we stammered awkwardly trying to come up with a solution and briefly wondered whose hotspot was showing up in the available wifi options (it turned out to be a poor girl who left our private dining room as soon as she heard us acting weird), the notes apps on our computers were finally put to good use.
The reason I am complaining? I had to go back to my House, wait for the internet to come back, and redo all of my updates. So you wasted my time, not unlike most of the men I’ve talked to. Thanks, but no thanks.
B.o.B. is going to be disappointed
International rap sensation B.o.B. is coming to Harvard on Friday. This should be good news, right? We can all ascend during “Airplanes” and dance as awkwardly as that guy from Weezer during “Magic.” However, there is a big issue that we may run into.
First of all, as B.o.B. lets us so eloquently know in “Nothin’ On You,” he likes it when a woman does her taxes. Ergo, he might want to do his taxes while here performing, nevermind that it will be the beginning of September and he probably has someone else file for him, but still, the possibility exists. If he decides to do that, he will be terribly disappointed by the lack of internet connection, and it will be all your fault.
On the other hand, if a Harvard lady decides that she might like a guy like B.o.B. to notice her (Author’s note: He is a flat earther, you can do better), she will not be able to do her taxes, thus not being able to impress him. So, it will be your fault if their love story gets ruined.
While some changes at Harvard this year are wonderful (such as Oatly being replaced by Planet Oat), the fact that you are unable to handle everyone being back on campus, especially since classes are not online anymore, is very sad. Please do better :(
Sincerely,
Matylda A. Urbaniak

As the gates of Harvard Yard opened on Tuesday, Aug. 31, the annual Freshman Convocation was set to take place in Tercentenary Theater. However, unlike in previous years, the Freshman Convocation was accompanied by an additional ceremony for the sophomore class.
The morning begins shortly before 11 a.m. as each of Harvard College’s 12 upperclassmen houses processes into Tercentenary Theater, waving house flags and holding pillars adorned with house names. Due to the pandemic, the Class of 2024 was not able to gather in person for their convocation last fall.
At 11 a.m., a quiet falls upon the entire Class of 2024, as the Rev. Matthew Ichihashi Potts, the Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church of Harvard University, commences the event with an Invocation.
During the ceremony, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College perform. The events also included music from the Harvard Glee Club, Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, Radcliffe Choral Society, and the Harvard University Band.
In addition to musical performances, University President Lawrence S. Bacow addresses the current sophomores about entering their second year at the College and the support mechanisms put into place to ensure a successful year for this class.
Nearing the end of the convocation, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair recognizes each of the 12 houses present in the Theater. Each time O’Dair announced a new house, the entire cohort of sophomores erupted with excitement, celebrating their entrance into the house system.
As students migrated toward the steps of Widener Library for a class photo, members of the Class of 2024 posed with Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana for a photo to remember this momentous occasion.
With Sophomore Convocation being the first time the entire Class of 2024 physically convened in one location, the students gathered to capture this moment with a class photo. Waving house flags and carrying the 2024 banner, the class photo represented a longstanding class tradition amid the relatively untraditional ceremony.
Residents of freshman dormitory Mower Hall walk past Weld Hall and into Tercentenary Theatre after congregating with their entryways in front of their dorms.
Bedecked in dresses and suits, freshmen walk past Thayer Hall and University Hall on their way to the steps of Widener Library for a class photo.
The Class of 2025, the largest in the College’s history, gathers tightly to fit in front of Widener Library for their class photo.
The freshman class takes their photo prior to taking their seats for the commencement of their Convocation ceremonies. University President Lawrence S. Bacow joins students in the center to help carry the banner for the Class of 2025.
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana addresses the Class of 2025 about humility and encountering perspectives that students might disagree with.
The Harvard University Band plays on the steps of Memorial Church in Tercentenary Theatre.
On a temperate Tuesday afternoon, a day before the start of classes, the Class of 2024 and 2025 begin their in-person Harvard journey.
