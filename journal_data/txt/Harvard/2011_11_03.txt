In the world of comic books, it does not take much to become a super hero. Average kid turned avenger after the death of his parents, zero becomes hero with the bite of a radioactive spider—all that is required seems to be a dose of tragedy and a pinch of being at the wrong place at the wrong time.
For Barry Allen, becoming the fastest man alive was just as easy. All it takes is an electrifying shock of lighting combined with a healthy dousing of chemicals. The next thing the guy knows, he is periodically skipping his day job as Central City Police Department’s scientist so that he can disguise himself as the Flash, spending a couple of blinks of the eye fighting crime and kicking ass.
DC Comics reintroduced the red spandex–clad speed demon to the world last month as part of their recent initiative to release new first issues of their various classic and dearly loved characters. New and old fans alike are bound to be impressed by the skillful artwork of Francis Manapul, who, along with Brian Buccellato, created the latest story line of “The Flash.” Each page contains a comfortable amount of activity as the frames shift between intricately drawn settings, animated character conversations, and exciting fighting sequences.
Issue #1 of “The Flash” kicks off with a short introduction to Barry Allen, a handsome, blue-eyed blond who also happens to be both wicked smart and lightning-bolt fast. Not much is revealed about his history, but his abilities are quickly realized when a gang of gun-toting troublemakers busts through the glass ceiling of the technology symposium he is attending and force him to transform into his superhero alter-ego and quickly stop them from stealing the exhibit’s valuables. The story progresses from there with interesting turns and revelations, concluding in a classic comic book cliffhanger.
Usually the most effective mode of telling any comic book’s story is through the artwork, not the text. “The Flash” is no exception. While the conversations are indeed relevant to the plot line, there are several moments when the writers go overboard with the corny dialogue and make the characters express themselves in the cheesiest of ways. Upon making their destructive entrance, the museum robbers open with lines such as, “Good night, kids,” and “Time to go to sleep.” Small bids for casual humor are unfortunately cheap at times, and threaten the mood of the situation.
This is not to say that the text as a whole is deficient, as there are just as many occasions of literary genius. The issue ends with a compelling philosophical internal monologue as The Flash speeds through the city streets, and the artwork throughout makes up for Manapul and Buccellato’s occasional poor choice of words. Subdued colors, detailed foregrounds and subtle yet meticulous backgrounds allow the story to progress with clear fluidity.
For those unfamiliar with “The Flash,” never fear. For readers who might have always wanted to jump into comics but were intimidated by the sheer volume and density of existing canon, this first issue is a great start. As is DC Comics’ intention, this is the time to start from the very beginning. Accessibility is no longer an issue, as this new release offers the opportunity to understand the series at its genesis, and the storyline and artwork easily generate interest.
The thing about comic books that non-fans do not recognize, but can very easily appreciate, is the ease with which they flow. “The Flash” is a short read that is made even shorter stylistically by minimal text and dynamic graphics. Future readers should be warned about the trite humor and imbecilic criminal dialogue, but the introspective thoughts of the fastest man alive and the elaborate artwork that showcases his ass-kicking abilities make “The Flash” #1 an entertaining read.

Strange Xenomorph/Predator-like creatures have finally discovered that there is an “above” to the Atlantic Ocean. They are coming for us, and their razor-sharp teeth and phosphorescent claws are fearsome-looking. Another thing—they clearly view humans as a food source. But don’t worry! Aquaman is (hopefully) here to save us! And thus opens the newly released “Aquaman” #1. DC Comics has recently released “The New 52,” an attempt to relaunch their superheroes to a new demographic, for all those who haven’t been keeping up with the previously impenetrable comic book market. Try to open a Batman comic—your viewing of “The Dark Knight” would not be able to help you decipher what the heck is going on in Gotham.
It’s nice to be able to have a fresh beginning for all of the superheroes, and Aquaman, the usually forgotten and mostly unknown merman/king of Atlantis may finally get the recognition he deserves, except when James Cameron made a pre-"Avatar" billion-dollar film version of the hero on "Entourage."
The book is set in Boston, and portrays Aquaman—real name Arthur—as an unsung hero.  Despite helping out the city police by taking care of gun-wielding criminals, the cops remain annoyed and unappreciative. When Aquaman sits down for a bite at a seafood restaurant, the other customers are aghast that he’d eat fish, since he supposedly talks to them. (Actually, fish are too “primitive” to talk and Aquaman simply reaches into their brain to control their movements.) An inquisitive blogger accosts him and unashamedly asks him how he feels when Saturday Night Live makes fun of him as “a punch line, laughingstock, and nobody’s favorite superhero.” As a lesser-known hero, DC is certainly acknowledging the public perception of Aquaman. However, the majority of this issue is spent setting up the Sea King as a YouTube punchline, and fails to really deliver any exciting superhero fare. It seems strange that a superhero could be so unappreciated and mocked. The police officers even condescendingly offer him a glass of water after he quickly handled their own problem.
The storyline doesn’t necessarily start right from the beginning, but it does helpfully and sneakily add in the major things you need to know about Aquaman. It is apparent that: first, his dad was a human and his mom was the queen of Atlantis; second, for reasons unknown to the audience, he somehow came to Atlantis’s rescue and subsequently became their king; and his love interest is Mera, a “Little Mermaid” lookalike who is supposedly stronger than Wonder Woman.
The book is easy to follow, and although it is unclear exactly what Aquaman’s powers are, apparently he can jump really high, control marine creatures, deflect bullets with his golden-scaled armor, and use his golden trident to do some cool stuff (flip over a truck, intimidate a pesky blogger, etc.).
Aquaman is not as well-known as the movie-made stars like Batman, Superman, and Spiderman—or even Green Lantern and Daredevil. His relative obscurity does give him some appeal as a fresh-faced hero. He's also a throwback to ancient gods, unlike the aliens, radioactive spiders, and angry billionaire citizens looking for justice in the more well-known superhero market.
Ivan Reis's artwork is exceptional.  It’s realistic without getting creepy. The story alone is a bit lacking in depth; most of the plot is glossed over. It leaves the reader asking questions like: Does the public really not like Aquaman? What’s the deal with Atlantis?  But most importantly, what will happen next? Will Aquaman defeat those human-eating creatures from the deep? Will they attack people on land? How will Atlantis fare with these monsters? I guess we’ll have to wait until the next issue to find out.
Over all, this introduction to the world of Aquaman is sufficient, but definitely doesn’t do enough (if anything at all) to enliven his lackluster reputation. But Aquaman is different than the many superheroes plastered all over movie theaters and toy stores, which is a welcome relief, and he provides a nice outlet for those looking to start reading a comic series from the beginning. Who knows? Maybe soon Aquaman will turn into an overblown, over-marketed hero, but for now he’s humble, helpful, and sentimental.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Occupy movement has become known for its many, and often contradictory, faces. Now we can add a new group of faces to that list—Ec 10 students.  Students in the popular introductory economics class walked out fifteen minutes into the class yesterday in a gesture of solidarity with the Occupy movement and to protest what the event organizers consider a class that promotes a “strongly conservative neoliberal ideology.”  We find it troubling that students would protest a class because of its supposed ideological bent at an institution dedicated to academic integrity.  Such an action sets a dangerous precedent of ideological discrimination against professors.
While it is true that Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who was lecturing during the walkout, has conservative views and held a position in the Bush Administration, we take issue with the claim that his class is inherently biased because he is the professor and author of its textbook.  The truth is that Ec 10, a requirement for economics concentrators, provides a necessary academic grounding for the study of economics as a social science. Professor Mankiw’s curriculum sticks to the basics of economic theory without straying into partisan debate.  We struggle to believe that we must defend his textbook, much maligned by the protesters, which is both peer reviewed and widely used.
Furthermore, the students protesting the class who desire that he give more time to other, less accepted schools of economic thought—like Marxism—would do well to remember that such interrogation is the domain of social theory, not economic theory. Supply-and-demand economics is a popular idea of how society is organized, and Mankiw’s Ec 10 never presents itself as more than that. As such, including other theories would simply muddy the waters of what is intended; Ec 10 is an introductory class that lays the foundation for future, more nuanced, study.
That being said, even if Ec 10 were as biased as the protesters claim it is, students walking out to protest its ideology set a dangerous precedent in an academic institution that prides itself on open discourse.  This type of protest ignores opposition rather than engages with it. Instead of challenging a professor to back up his claims, it tries to remove him from the dialogue.
Furthermore, the students’ attempt to connect their classroom protestations to the Occupy movement illustrates the disjointed and often unfocused nature of the movement.  Indeed, it seems ironic that students in an introductory economics course at Harvard feel that by walking out of their completely optional lecture taught by a famous economist on the theme of income inequality feel that their actions ought to be considered a sign of solidarity with the Occupy movement.  Such protests don’t show solidarity, they show ignorance and a lack of self-awareness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In current weeks, the Occupy Wall Street protests and accompanying spring-off demonstrations have begun to take on a wider set of issues than before. In one case, the Occupy Philadelphia movement recently published a “99 percent Declaration” that enumerates a list of demands. However, the publication of this declaration symbolizes the very confluence of disjointed and irrational goals of the Occupy movement as a whole.
First, the demands made demonstrate that the movement will inevitably fail to enact any true change, at least through current methods. One demand indicates that we must end currency “manipulation,” a request made without much consideration of the actual mechanism needed for this to occur. Preventing fluctuations in the value of a floating currency would require the virtual elimination of the open-market trading of currencies, a move that would halt global trade. Another inadequately founded demand is to end the outsourcing of labor in order to protect domestic jobs. However, copious economic research indicates that enabling the importation of services is often necessary in order to establish a dynamic economy. Overtaxing companies that enable foreign services, as the occupiers suggest the government do, would not only stifle domestic corporations but also limit global competitiveness. This would make everyone worse off, both the one percent and the 99 percent. Similarly, many of the other ideas of the movement seem good to organizers at a gut level. It is when we truly examine the underpinnings and logic of these points that their arguments simply fall apart. Although ideological goals can be inspiring, rationality should be paramount.
Second, the declaration reflects goals that individualistically seek to promote the interests of certain groups whilst arbitrarily punishing others. For instance, one goal demands that student loans be forgiven using a Wall Street tax, in order to reprimand financial institutions. However, arguing that some other entity should have to pick up the tab for one's education merely shirks individual responsibility. The individual who has assumed student debt has gained from a college education—to forgo the costs of that achievement is an unfair abandonment of repayment duty.
Even worse, the interjection of selfish goals, arranged largely by college students, threatens to completely derail the movement, by positioning it as a chance to better one’s own lot simply by demanding it loudly and for months on end. A popular Youtube clip shows an indebted Occupy Wall Street student protestor holding a sign proclaiming “Throw me a bone, pay my tuition.” His rationale for his request resigns itself to “People can say whatever they want.” Indeed, protestors are free to voice their grievances, but when the message is peppered with such self-serving demands there is no guarantee that anyone will listen to them. Ultimately, the “revolution” has devolved from an organization of members speaking out against inequity to a mob of people trying to get what's best for themselves.
Third, after one and a half months of protests, we have seen no real move toward implementing any proposed changes or solutions to the multitude of bemoaned problems. This lack of organization, driven by in part by a profound distaste for a leadership structure, has resulted in a movement that has no clear purpose but to collectivize the problems experienced by various special interest groups within the public. There is no one to negotiate with. No one to determine prioritization. No one to represent the movement. In order to handle the growing and evolving nature of Occupy Wall Street, someone must step up and take responsibility for leading the group if real change is to ever be on the cards. Currently, the Occupy movements resemble a “What do you hate?” protest wherein all involved get the opportunity to speak out. Prioritization is important; everyone cannot get everything they want all the time. Although idealistically their methodology seems appropriate, legitimate accomplishment in the absence of planning and structure will be impossible.
The current state of the Occupy movements demonstrates a far-reaching failure in organizational effectiveness. Without the clear vision and leadership that has made previous movements of civil disobedience successful, the protestors will be unable to achieve significant goals. All those in our community who support “Occupy” should take note.

We’ve heard less about the deficit in recent days, as the nation’s attention has turned back toward the indecent lack of jobs. That’s a good thing. Questions of the debt and deficit are important ones we must address as a nation. But the debate we held this summer was about simple alarmism and artificial panic, and neither of those do us any good, nor bring us closer to resolution on the question of our finances. Rather, there’s another important deficit that received far too little attention in all of the summer’s fervor over the debt ceiling, one that is both more immediate and potentially far more helpful.
I’m speaking about our nation’s infrastructure deficit. The general problem is simple: We have not, over the past half-century, engaged in ambitious public works projects as we once did. The examples are myriad; a few of them will serve to illustrate the general trend. The US lags behind the developed world in high-speed rail, with only one extant line, and a slow one at that. As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman never tires of pointing out, American airports are outdated in comparison to their Chinese counterparts. Of the US’s more than six hundred thousand bridges, nearly a quarter are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. If you’d prefer a twenty-first century metric, the US ranks thirty-first in average internet speed, despite the US having itself developed the internet less than thirty years ago. Each of these problems, and dozens more, are resolvable—not questions of technology we don’t have or labor we lack, but of the misallocation of our resources. And each of these problems imposes costs both on the economy and the quality of life of ordinary Americans.
That’s the US infrastructure deficit. It doesn’t have a single, massive number describing it. But when we compare it to the fiscal deficit, it’s clear that the infrastructure deficit is in many ways the more important one.
First, the infrastructure deficit bears a direct relationship to your quality of life, while the fiscal deficit does not. The fiscal deficit does have meaningful consequences on the long-term economic health of the nation. (Though there is little consensus just what those consequences are, and when they can be expected to emerge). The infrastructure deficit has consequences on the quality of life today. Whether you can drink from your tap; whether you can drive to work safely or not; whether your electricity is cheap or expensive. It also has long-term economic consequences. Businesses that can rely on roads in good condition to connect them to workers and consumers are likely to grow. Businesses must have access to affordable, reliable power and Internet to modernize and expand.
Second, the infrastructure deficit has a fairly constant “rate of interest,” while the fiscal deficit’s rate of interest is highly variable—and quite low. Bridges, of course, are not built with a depreciation rate stamped on their side. But nevertheless they degrade, in good economic times as well as bad. The dropping of the Dow does not stop tree roots from pushing their way up through roads or prevent pipes from rusting. A poor economy can reduce the wear on infrastructure somewhat, but only slightly. And the population of the US continues to grow and demand more and more modern infrastructure. Right now the interest rate on the fiscal deficit is near zero. Borrowing money is very cheap. (The T-bill interest rate in September was a staggering 0.093 percent!) The borrowed time that our patchwork infrastructure relies on is not. It will cost us more every day; it is the clear priority.
Finally, addressing the infrastructure deficit can help the economy, while addressing the fiscal deficit can only hurt it. Building bridges hires the unemployed. It gets them off the welfare roles and starts them spending again. It raises wages by giving workers greater leverage, because they have other job options. It bails out underwater mortgages and other debt. It stimulates demand. Austerity measures—that is, cutting government services or increasing taxes—the only two ways to bring down the fiscal deficit, have none of those benefits. Instead, austerity takes money out of the economy. When we’re in troubled economic times, fighting the infrastructure deficit can help pull us out. Fighting the fiscal deficit only digs us deeper.
The most important deficit in America today is the one we’re not talking about. But unless we do, we’ll face increasing expense maintaining our standards of living and slower economic development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
“Let’s Talk About Sexual Assault,” The Crimson’s recent editorial, while commendable for its desire to make Harvard a more welcoming place for victims and a safer one for all students, misrepresented the current structures in place to support victims of assault, and neglected to mention others.
First, the editorial alleged that students do not receive enough information regarding the process of reporting and prosecuting a case of sexual assault. It should be noted that campuses nationwide rely on Sex Signals to introduce students to the unfortunate reality of sexual assault in the collegiate environment. For many of these schools, Sex Signals is a “be-all end-all” approach to informing the campus about these issues.
At Harvard, however, it does not stand alone. As an institution, we are relatively unique in requiring students to discuss the issues raised by the performance in a one-hour seminar. The trained students who lead these sessions inform students of the resources available along with disseminating their contact information. Should students forget these seminars entirely, purple stickers on the bathroom doors of nearly every toilet on campus also contain the phone numbers of many groups that offer help to assault victims.
The Crimson’s editorial also argued that the people providing support are poorly trained and coordinated. This is untrue. All of these groups continue to work together along with University Health Services, Mental Health Services, the Bureau of Study Council, residential life staff, student leaders, and other peer counseling groups to provide a supportive network for victims of sexual assault, however they wish to proceed. Members of the OSAPR Alliance and Response undergo thorough training programs and the staff at OSAPR is comprised of certified professionals. In fact, Harvard’s network for prevention and support is largely without peer in this country.
Of course, and of course unfortunately, sexual assault at Harvard still goes unreported—but the Crimson cannot blame Harvard for this. Sexual assualt is one of the most underreported crimes in the world. According to the National Center for Victims of Crime, under 39 percent of all domestic assaults were reported to law enforcement officers.
Fear of social stigma; anxiety that the perpetrator will be found innocent; the need to understand emotional trauma privately before bringing into the public realm; and uncertainty over whether an incident can even be called “rape,” are all reasons for this discouragingly low statistic. And all of these reasons are discussed in the one-hour freshman seminars. We wish that such reasons, like social stigma, didn’t exist, but how a victim handles sexual assault is ultimately his or her choice. In many cases, the victim will choose counseling over persecution, and so that is what Harvard’s resources will provide.
Lastly, the Crimson misunderstood Harvard’s definition of sexual assault. It does, in fact, exclude consent given under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and is not just limited to vocalized “negative unwillingness. The full definition can be found on the OSAPR website.
Sexual assault is a difficult and painful reality. We agree that whatever path the victim chooses to take, be it prosecution or counseling, the process should be transparent and the resources easily accessible. We also agree that students should be fully aware of the available resources, so that they can make informed decisions. But we hope that future discussion of such a weighty topic will show a greater accuracy and understanding.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Paisner ’12
Emma Wood ’12

Were you aware that students paid attention to your style?
Yes, I knew because some of my female students would ask me where I got my suits from. I told them, and two of them actually managed to find the exact same suits online!
How do you pick your clothes?
I don’t know if I have a specific type of cut or color I’m looking for. Instead, I try to maintain my level of happiness, so that my good mood can spread to whatever decisions I make and help me choose the right thing.
What has influenced your style?
Well, I grew up in Tokyo, studied in Canada, and now am working in America, so I think that mix of different cultures has all combined to make my clothing choice a bit different. I think the biggest influence was from my college days. I played the piano and figure skated for five years. I remember I had to choose costumes for special competitions, costumes that matched with the music and choreography of my dances. I think just being involved with so many artistic activities somehow taught me to express myself.
What is your favorite article of clothing?
I have a lucky bag that I got from graduate school at Princeton. I also have a green keychain holder that just makes me very happy.
Do you think your field of study has influenced your fashion?
I wear a Kimono once a year, on Dec. 1, to my Kyoto class. Not many people dress in traditional clothing anymore in Japan, and I like to be able to show to my students what it’s really like. I think a lot of professors in our department are sensitive to the cultural elements we bring to class. Actually, sometimes my colleague, Mark Warren, wears very special ties to work, and I can find them very inspiring.
Do you ever look at yourself in reflective surfaces?
I don’t know. I can avoid looking at them. I really hate it whenever I have to do a filmed lecture.
Sections
Were you aware that your students paid attention to your style?
No, not particularly.
What is your favorite article of clothing?
A tweed suit on a fall day. It really makes me feel like I’m in New England. I also have a lucky tie with red and blue patterns. I got it in 1988 from Filene’s Basement when I was in college, and I wore it every time I had an interview.
What is your personal reason for dressing well?
I do it to show respect for my students. When you dress up, it shows that you are taking them seriously and that you take your role seriously. I believe that it’s possible to be traditional without being dull. It’s sometimes hard to dress up with men’s clothing—like there’s a law that sets rigid standards. I like to be able to insert a bit of fun wherever I can, also because I know that law school can be a bit boring for a lot of students.
Where do you find your fun clothing?
My favorite store in the Square is The Andover Shop. I get a lot of my ties from J. Press. In fact, my first tie was from there. I got it when I was 14—it was this beautiful, sunny striped silk one. A lot of my ties are also hand-me downs from my dad, who was in Cambridge when Harvard Square was still filled with tie shops.
Do you ever look at yourself in reflective surfaces?
I hope not.
Sections
Did you know that students paid attention to your style?
Yes. When I first started teaching five years ago, I got a few positive comments through the CUE evaluations.
What’s your morning routine?
I never really think about it too much. I have two kids, so in the morning I’m just trying to make sure they’re happy.
What’s your personal reason for dressing well?
I think it’s a sign of respect for students. And it’s a way to make yourself presentable and show that you take the class seriously. I think clothes, when they help me feel appropriate, can help me to communicate well. On the other hand, I really don’t care about how students dress.
I noticed you’re not wearing a tie. Do you ever wear them?
Oh, no ties. I think they’re uncomfortable. I’ve worn maybe three ties in the past five years.
So how would you describe your style?
I was afraid you were going to ask that question. Well, one thing I like to do is match my shirt with my socks. I also like to wear intense colors, like pink or red shirts. I guess you can’t really tell that since I look all boring in black and white today. Sometimes I really enjoy wearing a pair of brown pants during the fall to match with the leaves on the ground, kind of as a way to model the season.
Where do you get your clothes?
Well, I really like Hugo Boss. Honestly, I don’t really enjoy shopping that much. I go once every two years and spend a lot of time in the store picking out all that I need.
Wow, that’s a really long time. So you don’t really change that much, do you?
No, no I don’t.
Do you look at yourself in reflective surfaces?
No ... I don’t believe so.
Sections
Were you aware that your students paid attention to your style?
No, I wasn’t aware.
How would you describe your style?
I hope it’s neat and tidy.
Where do you get your clothes from?
Ann Taylor—they have small sizes that fit me well.
What is your morning routine for getting ready?
I just like to dress with whatever is professional and appropriate for the weather. I wear my hats to protect me from the cold in the winter and to block the sun in the summer.
Is there a story behind your winter hat?
Yes, there is. I bought it here in 1996 when I was a visiting professor from Ireland, since I needed something to protect my head from the unspeakable cold, and the leopard motif round the brim reminded me of my tabby cat, Catiline, who was left behind in Dublin. I lost it once in Widener, but thank goodness it turned up in Lost Property.
What is your favorite thing to wear?
Jeans on a Saturday.
Do you look at yourself in reflective surfaces?
No—the only times I look are to make sure that nothing is out of place.
Sections
Were you aware that students paid attention to your style?
Yes. My students tease me for wearing sandals to class.
What is your personal reason for dressing the way you do?
It’s for comfort [and also for] partly physiological reasons. I have extremely good circulation, and so my feet get hot really easily. I have to wear sandals to survive.
So do you dress up with your students in mind?
I’ve been teaching for about 16 to 17 years, and I’ve found that there is no one style of teaching that is best. When you dress, you pick a style of interaction. I remember when I was in college, I had two professors: an extremely proper English gentlemen and a soft-spoken woman from the South. Both were fantastic, but I found the woman to be much more approachable. Personally, I dress comfortably so that my students can feel comfortable when they ask me about philosophy.
Do you think being in the Philosophy department has influenced your style?
Philosophy is a field without a barrier of entry—anyone, regardless of background or experience, can study it. All students need to do is just learn to appreciate what the questions are. I’m the head tutor, and I stand as a guide for all the neophytes who get lost in this maze. Since philosophy is already confusing enough, I don’t want to create any distractions for the students. I wouldn’t be extremely dressed up, but I wouldn’t wear jeans either.
Do you ever look at yourself in reflective surfaces?
Nooo—I find that awkward.

Hey, Professor of the Humanities Stephen Greenblatt:
The movie “Anonymous,” directed by Roland Emmerich, talks about the Shakespeare authorship controversy; what is your opinion of the film and your own assessment of the controversy in general?
"I haven’t seen the film yet; only reviews.  The film might be amusing—though I thought Emmerich’s “Independence Day” was unrelieved schlock—but the premise, from a scholar’s perspective, is utterly absurd.  The so-called Oxfordian claim to authorship of Shakespeare’s plays is akin to the claim that NASA faked the films of the moon landing using footage from a studio in Hollywood."

From glitzy music videos to clumsy homemade recordings, the phenomenon of YouTube dancing tells us one thing: people love to watch other people get down. This week, FM brings you a selection of the very best videos the internet has to offer of people bopping, grooving and boogying like there ain’t no tomorrow.
Video: Spike Jonze Presents: Lil Buck and Yo-Yo Ma
Song: Saint-Saëns’ “The Swan”
If the word “cool” was ever in the word “classical,” Yo-Yo Ma ’76 would know how to put it back in. A cellist and a street dancer may seem like a strange pairing, but the combined talent of these two virtuosos makes their collaboration a sight worth seeing. At first I was like, wtf, and then I was like, omg.
Video: OK Go “Here It Goes Again” (Official Video)
After this video’s release OK Go probably thought they had made it to the big leagues. More than 50 million views plus a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video–what more could a surprisingly athletic but otherwise generic indie band dream of? Well, perhaps not being known as “that treadmill band” for the rest of their lives ...
Video: Baby Dancing to Beyoncé!
Song: Beyoncé “Single Ladies”
As we know, combining Beyoncé with a baby is guaranteed to result in more media attention than anyone knows what to do with. However, the star of this nauseatingly famous video, Baby Cory, has taught us that the child doesn’t necessarily have to be her own. Having charmed YouTube enthusiasts the world over with his musically adept knee bounces and side-to-side waddling, Baby Cory skilfully continues to cultivate his public image through his own Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Video: The T-Mobile Royal Wedding
Song: East 17 “House of Love”

2002 in the fairly tame world of R&B: the golden age of matching outfits, inventive head coverings, and decked-out Burberry. Yet what really makes this era distinctive is an incredible capacitiy and affinity for synchronization—as demonstrated by the likes of boy band B2K. Smooth moves executed in near-robotic unison? We still be wantin’ them “so damn bad.”

On a sidewalk in Palestine, a withered old man hunches over a pack of matches, striking and re-striking them but never able to produce a flame. His kerosene-drenched pajamas clinging to his limbs, he asks, “What’s the point? Live or die, it’s all the same.” Expressionless, a neighbor steps forward and silently takes the matches out of the man’s hand, helping him to hobble back inside: for him, an oft-repeated routine.
This scene, played out in Elia Suleiman’s cinematic memoir, “The Time That Remains,” reveals the senseless reality of living and dying under occupation, and gives voice to the nuances of the Palestinian experience. The theme of absurdity and desperation was a common one in this year’s Boston Palestine Film Festival, which showcased Palestinian documentaries, narratives, short films, and visual art. It took place from Oct. 21 to 30 in locations as varied as the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard Law School.
Although the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is regularly covered in the popular media, the stories presented are often incomplete snapshots. “Chaotic pictures are not enough,” said Samir Abdallah, who directed “Gaza-strophe,” a documentary about Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip in the days after the so-called cease-fire in 2009. “You have to have a narrative.”
In the film, his camera scans the landscape of Gaza, capturing missile strikes disconcertingly similar in appearance to firework shows on the Fourth of July, and entering shanty towns constructed of debris and fraying white tarps. The film penetrates a landscape untouched by most Western media. “It is a complete siege: by photos, by film, by audio,” Abdallah said.
While films alone cannot solve a conflict or change a history, they can inspire discussion. “I have a chance to reach people with this film and to make them think differently,” explained Gabriella Bier, director of “Love During Wartime,” another documentary shown at the festival. Any intervention “has to start with something that’s close to you, like music or art.” From this creative expression arises the opportunity to represent an experience and, perhaps, to incite change.
“The communication is not only through direct argumentation, but also through cultural, artistic, and aesthetic representations,” said Nimer Sultany, a Palestinian and Harvard Law School student who was involved in organizing the festival. “It’s one step down the road to a more rational discussion.”

Facebook correspondence is nice. A thoughtful text message can be parsed and analyzed for its every tacit meaning. These forms of communication are effective, but even the suavest of emoticons cannot encapsulate emotion the way paper and ink once did. Decades before our fireplaces were barren and boarded, some of Harvard’s finest enflamed their paramours with good-ol’-fashioned print. Armed with the unsurpassable standard set by “Love Story,” FM set off to Houghton, Pusey, and the Archives, to track the romantic triumphs and travails of undergraduates through the ages.
Like love on campus in general, however, passionate letters postmarked by Harvard lovers were hard to find. “We did an exhibition a few years ago about Romantic Harvard ...” trailed Barbara S. Meloni, Public Services Archivist at Harvard University Archives. “It was a small exhibition case.”
Among the featured items of said petite exhibition were former University President Samuel Langdon’s missives. In one letter, sent to Elizabeth Brown, Langdon wrote, “I doubt not of your improvement in every thing Beautiful and Commendable ... I trust you will ever be mindful of me.” These subtle sentiments proved winning; Betty Brown would become Mrs. Samuel Langdon.
Further documenting love at Harvard is a series of diaries penned by one F.H. Viaux, Class of 1870. On Sept. 22, 1868, Viaux wrote that he “received a very loving letter from Louise; she now ... is less formal, beginning with ‘My Dear Friend’ and ending it with ‘Louise...’” Dude, she totally wants you.
The love letters of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, to his first wife, Alice Lee Hathaway, are currently on display at Pusey Library. One such letter, stamped in the top left corner with the words “Porcellian Club,” is signed “Your loving, Thee.” They married shortly after his graduation, he achieving his B.A., and she, her MRS.
Houghton Library, meanwhile, boasts a collection of letters that, while not written at Harvard desks, can serve as inspiration for current romantic souls. The famed letters sent from John Keats to his “Bright Star,” Fanny Brawne, as well as those sent from Ralph Waldo Emerson, Class of 1821, to his first wife, Ellen, and then to his second wife, Lydia, are all within the collections. Leslie A. Morris, the curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library, explained that the library does not actively collect love letters, but it does collect what it terms personal papers. “Since most people at one point in their life fall in love ... they just happen to be there,” Morris said. “But it always gives you a much more personal sense of the writer when you come across something like a love letter.”

“When we think about taxation, we need to remember that General Electrics is not a person” says a Republican. A girl sitting nearby replies: “really?!” Her face is full of disdain. Later, a Democrat quips: “Unless Texas has accidentally executed it, it’s not really a person.”

One Republican’s oration is segmented by disconcerted pauses and rigid gestures: “I don’t see what’s wrong with income inequality. The free market is about competition. The whole point of capitalism is to make money. Lebron James is good at basketball, do we begrudge him that?” Everybody loves a good sports analogy.

Formal debate has come to a close. It is now time for audience questions. The moderator had planned to alternate parties, but asks, “is anyone here not a Democrat or a Republican?” A precaution. “My blockmate is a libertarian, but he left,” one student responds. Welcome to American politics.

Antone Martinho III ’13 calls himself a conservative Republican. He is adamantly pro-life, and he firmly believes in conservatism.
And yes, he’s a student at Harvard.
“My freshman year I remember meeting a girl who insisted that she had heard about Republicans, but I was apparently the first one she ever met,” jokes Martinho, who is a “dues-paying member of the Harvard Republican Club.”
According to popular conception, conservatives are few and far between on Harvard’s liberal campus. In reality, a strong contingent of conservative students call it home.
BREAKING THE MOLD
When Molly A. Wehlage ’13 came to Harvard from Indiana—“you know, God’s country”—she was surprised by the diversity of the student body.
“I’ve always been very conservative,” says Wehlage. “I even started the Republican Club at my high school.”
And since coming to Harvard, Wehlage finds that she has grown only more committed to her beliefs.
“I think any high school student is influenced by their parents, their friends, and the environment they grew up in,” Wehlage relates, describing how the largely liberal Harvard community has pressured her to defend her views. “Being at Harvard, I’ve really grown.”
A CONSERVATIVE TEMPERAMENT
President of the Harvard Republican Club (HRC) Mike W. McLean ’12, who considers himself a “mainstream Republican,” wears his conservative stripes with pride.
McLean thinks that the perception of Harvard’s conservative population underestimates its real size because conservatives on campus tend to be a little quieter than their liberal, progressive peers.
“A lot of those people aren’t super political,” says McLean. “In my involvement in the HRC, I’ve met people who say ‘Yeah, I’m a Republican, but I wouldn’t join the Republican Club.’”
Martinho, an associate editor for The Salient, believes that conservatives tend to be less collectively raucous in their expression of political beliefs.
“[Conservatives] aren’t as vocal about a lot of things, especially in a place like this. They will often take the high and quiet road,” says Martinho. “It’s a sense of ‘We’re not the yellers!’”
McClean corroborates Martinho’s point, noting that he believes that conservatism is, in many ways, against protest as a means of political communication.
“You won’t find conservatives with signs in Harvard Yard,” McClean laughs. “You won’t find them on a hunger strike tying themselves to a tree. It’s not part of being a conservative.”
BLUE IS THE OLD CRIMSON
Sarah R. Siskind ’14 perceives Harvard’s liberal reputation to be truer of faculty than of the student body. Yet she does not feel marginalized.
“Very rarely have I felt that my views are unwelcome. Most people see my views as contributing to the debate,” says Siskind.
Siskind, who identifies as a libertarian, frequently attends events at the Institute of Politics and writes regularly for the Harvard Political Review.
During a “Harvard on the Move” run, Siskind struck up a lively debate with professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 that later continued in email.
“We got into a heated political discussion about the nature of libertarianism and how it applies to public works,” says Siskind. “I was very breathless by the end. What was normally a run on the shorter side left us very winded.”
Siskind has come to look forward to these types of conversations.
“I think even though he recognizes our differences in views he respects those differences,” insists Siskind. “It’s certainly entertaining and it certainly makes me run faster.”
Many conservative students on campus take their position in the ideological minority as a chance to learn from their peers, using the opportunity to think critically about their political beliefs and refining their ideas.
“I think conservatives receive the best education at Harvard, there’s no doubt about that in my mind, whether that’s by your professors in the classroom or your peers in the dining hall,” says McClean.
Martinho, who was at first a bit overwhelmed by Harvard’s largely liberal student body, describes how he has since acclimated to life at Harvard.
“From my perspective, it’s a lot of fun to be a Republican at Harvard. It’s entertaining to me, everyday. That definitely wasn’t my perspective when I first got here,” laughs Martinho.
And he assures that there’s fun in the rivalry.
“One of my best friends is extremely liberal. We end up rolling on the floor laughing about politics.”

There are monsters in the water. I have known this ever since I was young. I am still afraid of the deep, dark water—even when it’s summer and I’m rushing to the beach, running to the ocean that I’ve missed through the winter. The beaches are packed in the hot season, and I have to work hard to find a quiet spot. But every time, I do: I bury my phone and my keys in the sand and I slalom down past the pinktoasted tourists on my way to the water. Then it’s the wash of the surf, then a few clumsy strokes, then it’s finally just me and the darkness.
I’ve been scared of deep water ever since I could swim. But I’ve loved to swim ever since I could swim, too. At the beach I used to splash around on the surface, imagining all the things that might be down there. None of them were real, of course: real things would never be so frightening. They weren’t properly formed, either, my monsters; I never sketched out an anatomy or a motive. All I came up with were sketches: a tentacle, some teeth, spines and a sucker and a terrible eye. My body, loosely wrapped in soft and pink, would never stand a chance.
It was doggy-paddle in those days, arms flapping out front just enough to stay afloat while I stared at the darkwater beneath me. I always leaned forwards so I could see further into the blue-and-green—well, past the blue-and-green, really, into the darkness that kept going full of seaweed full of monsters full of fear. And when my imagination worked hardest: it was a darkness full of me.
Every kid’s scared of the dark, and like every kid I got over it in time. My mother told me to worry instead about the things that actually do exist. Still the thrill of the deep never really went away, even if it wasn’t quite so frantic. In my pre-teens it settled into a mild kind of fear mixed with wonder, never enough to arouse a panic. Plus the feeling came only when I was alone in the deep—and only when I thought about it.
Mind you, there were logical reasons to be frightened of the water. I learned that the term “shark nets” was a horrible betrayal, because they didn’t actually cover the whole beach and couldn’t stop sharks from coming in if they wanted. There would be an attack in the news every now and then. I was unsure of even my landspeed, so I had no right to back myself in the water. And the other thing: those toothy bastards move like lightning and grab you out of nowhere. My policy was, and is, as follows: if there is someone farther out from shore who is tastier than me and slower than me, then that person would be the reasonable choice and no reasonable man-eating seamonster should have the slightest interest in my inconvenient self. Even this method failed to settle me entirely, though.
I kept on swimming, despite or because of my fear. On some nights of regular teenage angst,  I would sneak up to the pool by myself—but not to swim laps like I calmly did during the day. Instead, I would jump into the dark, clean water and duck my head under, eyes closed. The water gently resisted all my gestures, which were turned into clumsy slow-motion, and it felt like anything was possible. I moved hesitantly, savoring the touch of the cold, then I’d feel a little tension slowly rising. My body would move, just a little, then the water would ripple and dance, so I’d have to make more movements because I wanted to be in charge—but the water moved as quickly as I did. We raced each other at increasing speed until I was thrashing, splashing at the surface and taking big breaths. Then I’d swim laps until I was tired and I’d sit on the side with my legs in the water as my breathing became steady again. I felt practically omnipotent after that.
Since I moved away to the cold, I long for the beach like I never did before. I don’t swim very often: I was never all that good, so the MAC is intimidating, and the Charles is either frozen or repulsive. When I get home, I can hardly wait for the ocean. I’m not sure if I’m frightened, still, but it always feels unsettling when I swim out to the deep. I don’t imagine monsters, nor do I think of sharks. All that is part of something vaguer, something more exciting—something that makes me run on the sand and skip over the surf. The sun hurts my back and my eyes, but I know I won’t feel it once my head’s underwater. In the deep and the dark, there will only be me and myself and the slow, unnerving feeling that I’ve got something to say but no one around to tell it to.

I’ve been reading memoirs. Mostly books about growing up on little farms in small towns like Flushing, Michigan and Plains, Georgia, and about small kids who know how to build model boats and recognize train engines by the sound of the whistles. I want a life like that. Eventually I want my kids to have a life like that. Those books are becoming parts of a larger narrative—my own. I’m stealing some of their bits and pieces.
I’ve been reading other stories, too: Modern Love essays that run in the Sunday Style section of the New York Times. I’ve been reading the column since 2004, when I was too young to know much about love at all. A few months ago I read a Modern Love essay about a woman who finds love in an unexpected place. She’s visiting Michigan with her sister and meets a man who owns a café off of Lake Superior—a wooden shop on a little street, surrounded by a huge, huge sky. She turns to her sister and tells her that he’s the one. They marry within months—it’s crazy—but they do, and now they often snowmobile to work. It’s almost too much for me to handle, a story like that.
See, I want that. In my case it’s Montana—it’s always been Montana. I’ve never been there, but sometimes you need to put a name to a place, even when you’re dreaming. I like big sky and big mountains, and I don’t like skiing but I like snow and I love hot chocolate.
I grew up in New York City on 113th street. My boyfriend Sam grew up on 112th. We went to the same high school, but only met near the end of our senior years, and though we rode the subway home together, we didn’t realize how close our buildings really were. The first few months we dated were easy. We’d kiss often in our elevators. We’d worry whether there might be cameras, but we would do it anyway. He would walk me home at dusk, and then we’d meet again in the morning, a few hours later, to walk his dogs in Riverside Park. Sometimes we’d follow the stroll with breakfast.
Sam goes to MIT now, so he’s not as close. But there are degrees of proximity; I think it’s both near and far. The distance works because Boston is our middle ground. We go there for dinner and dates, and last year we spent a week in the city house-sitting for my cousin and her cat. We went out for sushi, and after dinner we got caught in a snowstorm. Sam took off his jacket and gave it to me. His t-shirt was soaked through. We ran home and put on the kettle. The cat snuggled with us on the couch.
I told Sam recently that I wanted to move to Montana with him and bake scones in a small café, just the two of us, like in the Modern Love essay. He leaned over and kissed me. “I haven’t read that one yet. Tell me about it.”

For years, before I’d go to bed every night, I’d spend at least half an hour planning my outfit for the next day. Taking note of the weather and the occasion, I lovingly prepared something that would show off all of my best assets. Essentially, I put a lot of care into what I wore.
But there was always one big flaw in my fleshed out plan: I needed something to carry my things. Bags are heavy, problematic, and they would cover up the outfit that took me hours of painstaking preparation. Pockets are uncomfortable and they’d make things bulge where they definitely should not. So, what was I to do? The idea hit me one day when I accidentally put on my seven-year-old sister’s jeans. A nice little shelf of stomach poured out over the top, and I realized that it would be the perfect place to store my cell phone, money, pens, and the like.
At first, I wasn’t sure what the name of this attractive alternative pack was. I’ve always heard that this layer of fat is taboo in our society of perfect abs, stick-thin figures, and Giselle Bundchen look-a-likes, and I’ve often seen others cringe at the mere mention of it. But, after just a few days of indulgence, I became a follower of the engrossing trend that I now know to be called the muffin top.
Why do we hate the muffin top anyway? We avoid it like the plague without even considering its usefulness. If we can all subscribe to the fashion of tote bags, fanny packs, and cargo pants, we can just as easily switch to the more practical muffin top. It’s a more discreet, subtle, and safe—honestly, who is going to mug your muffin top?—way to carry around everything you need.
Now is the best time to follow this trend. It’s the season of crop tops, made precisely to be the warm butter to the muffin top. The only ingredients you need are pants that are between three and five sizes too small (proportionate to how much you are planning to carry) and a crop top, tank top, or halter top. Minimal preparation time, and it satisfies all of your cravings for convenience and style.

First off, let it be known that I am a breakfast kind of person. My daily pilgrimage across the Yard at the ungodly hour of 8 a.m., guided by the divine promise of Colossal Crunch and bananas, has become a ritual. Once in the d-hall, I inhale the array of oatmeal, pastries, and fruits, enraptured. The plethora of food is my early morning paradise. I shall not want.
It is thus most unfortunate that my inner state of bliss must inevitably be jarred by the sight, smell, and feel of a specific monstrosity—the muffin top.
I am talking about that most reprehensible, fat-inducing item: that crusty, congealed cap of puffed-up pastry that taints the otherwise beauteous buffet of breakfast foods greeting me in the morning.
Now, I am not usually one to discriminate based on appearance. I have heard all the moralizing maxims before: don’t judge a book by its cover, and the like. I know from past experience that once you gather up enough courage to pry off the unpalatable top of the muffin, you are soon rewarded with nectar and ambrosia all at once. But must such a cruel punishment be endured to reach the reward? After all, I would rather not have to see a mass of what bears an uncanny resemblance to coagulated vomit and road- kill mixed together and baked for 20 minutes on my plate. I have seen enough of that on random street corners during late-night fuel-up runs to Noch’s.
Muffins are scrumptious pastries deep, deep, deep down. So please, muffin makers of the world, stop shortchanging them and leave them topless, for good.

When history Professor Nancy F. Cott took the stand in January 2010, she was stepping into a highly contentious arena that had drawn California’s governor and most ardent supporters of gay marriage into a battle over the legality of Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state.
Cott was called as an expert witness by the plaintiffs’ lawyers, who had flown her, one of the foremost historians of marriage in the United States, cross-country to refute Prop 8 supporters’ claims to fact. Cott is in favor of same-sex marriages. She reached this conclusion, she says, “as a result of my historical research and study.” She argues, “[I]f gender symmetry and equality and the couples’ own definition of spousal roles are characteristic of marriage, then same-sex couples seem perfectly able to fulfill those roles.”
In a time when same-sex marriage had been legalized in six states and was being discussed around the nation, Prop 8 was a local trial with seemingly national ramifications. Everyone was watching.
Over the course of her four-hour testimony, Cott used her decades of research to debunk each of the Prop 8 defendants’ claims. They claimed that procreation was one of the central tenets of marriage; they claimed that children were better off in heterosexual family structures; they claimed that heterosexual monogamy was the “American way” of marriage. Cott deconstructed each assertion, showing that history proved each of the defense’s claims was unfounded.
Cott knows more about marriage history in the United States than perhaps anyone alive. The other expert witness brought by the plaintiffs, Yale Professor of History George Chauncey, had been Cott’s dissertation advisee when she taught at Yale prior to coming to Harvard.
As Cott took the stand, Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr. of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher of the plaintiffs’ legal team took the floor. What did Cott think, he asked, of the assertion made by one of lead defense attorneys Charles J. Cooper’s opening remark that “the purpose of the institution of marriage, the central purpose, is to promote procreation and to channel naturally procreative sexual activity between men and women into stable and enduring unions”?
“It rather reminded me of the story about the seven blind men and the elephant,” she said to the jury and packed courtroom, “in that each of them is feeling the animal at some side of it; and the one that feels the trunk says, oh, this animal is just like a snake.”
In other words, Cooper’s definition of marriage, Cott thought, was so limited as to be inept.
In her testimony responding to Boutrous, Cott easily recalled dates, facts, historical accounts, and past precedents. Cott presented the anti-miscegenation laws, which banned white people from marrying minorities, as a historical parallel to discrimination against lesbians and gays. Questions ranged from interracial marriage to husband-wife gender dynamics to procreation’s role in marriage. The content of her testimony harkened back to “Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation,” her most recent book, which was met with critical acclaim.
When the defense was handed the floor, though, the tenor of the questions shifted. Questions from Boutrous seemed like softballs compared to defense attorney David Thompson’s cross-examination.
Thompson dug into Cott’s past, scrutinizing her past testimonies from other trials, statements she had made for the media, her previous academic work (even from 34 years past), and her personal donations to marriage-related non-profits. Thompson was doing his best to present Cott as an impassioned gay rights activist, biased and unreliable, rather than the neutral and objective scholar whom Boutrous had presented her to be.
Cott had worked hard to maintain the appearance of impartiality. Cott—like many other scholars of hot button issues—skirts the line between the role of activist and public historian, and sitting on a witness stand, those two roles converged.
Thompson baited her, trying to discredit her testimony by drawing out her personal feelings about marriage equality.
An example: “You think gays and lesbians should have the right to marry, correct?” Thompson asked.
“I have come to that view from my research and study of the history of marriage, yes,” Cott returned.
“And you feel that you’re somewhat between a neutral party and an advocate, correct?” he continued.
“I would call myself not an advocate, but someone who has come to a personal opinion as a result of my historical research and study of this matter of the history of marriage for quite a number of years now,” Cott replied.
“Let’s see what you said during your Iowa deposition,” Thompson said, drawing from the past. “The next page, page 59, top of the page, lines 1 through 4. You said: ‘So I feel I’m somewhat between a neutral party and an advocate, in that I feel I’m led by my particular historical expertise to feel that this is the direction.’”
Thompson moved on to his next point without allowing Cott to respond. “Now, you’ve put in amicus briefs and signed on to amicus briefs in New York, New Jersey, and Washington State; is that correct?”
“Historian’s briefs, that is right,” she clarified.
“And you weren’t compensated for your work in those cases, were you?”
“I was not.”
Media coverage of the trial—and there was much of it—reported that over the course of Thompson’s cross-examination, Cott was becoming increasingly impatient.
“Okay. And you volunteered your time because you viewed this as an important civil rights issue, correct?”
“I volunteered my time because I think it’s very important for historians to contribute to public-policy discussions.”
Retrospectively, the plaintiffs deemed Cott’s testimony a success. “She was a tour de force,” Boutrous wrote in an emailed statement. “[H]er testimony was powerful, compelling and the cross examination didn’t lay a glove on her.”
The defense, also, deemed Cott’s testimony as having supported their own cause: “She never explained why some restrictions are O.K. and some are not,” Jordan Lorence told The New York Times. “She never explained why a polygamist group can’t make the exact same argument that they’re legally discriminated against despite having a loving, stable family—except that a lot more people oppose polygamy.”
Cott thought the testimony she gave was objective and well-researched, but also noted that “no one can be completely objective about anything. One can be well-reasoned, logic, and fair, but there is no such thing as absolute objectivity.”
BACK ON CAMPUS
On campus, two years later, Cott deals with the same material, but in a much calmer environment.
With her right elbow perched on the podium, her hand dangling off to the side, Cott lectures about gender in the post-World War II period to 40 students in her United States in the World course, “Men and Women in Public and Private in the Twentieth Century.”
She has taken an unusual approach to the era and focused her class on men and masculinity rather than the oft-harped upon “feminine mystique.” Pressing her thumb and forefinger together, she gesticulates for emphasis as she explains how Cold War anxiety influenced gender roles and the domestic sphere. In her analysis, she uses almost every source imaginable: quotations, statistics, advertisements, photographs, diary entries, and personal letters. She rarely references her notes.
At the podium, Cott is at ease. She wears simple black garments, and she runs her hand through her short brown hair every once in a while as she gazes out the window, though she never drops her lecture or train of thought.
“I do believe that passion can coexist ... [with] reason and logic,” Cott said. “In the classroom, I have a responsibility not to appear partisan. One can make it clear, especially in the case of the Lavender Scare, that a lot of persecution happened without having to yell or scream. The facts of the event make it clear enough.”
She tries to make eye contact with each of her students in lecture, who type furiously away on their laptops (whether they are taking notes or chatting on Facebook, she cannot tell). Her tone remains steady, even when she discusses injustices such as the purging of gay Americans from government positions during the infamous “Lavender Scare.”
Cott’s passion for the subject matter has been a source of inspiration for her students, who say that she balances conviction and objectivity.
“I have found Professor Cott’s courses to be the most inspiring that I’ve taken at Harvard,” Lilly B. Corning ’13, who is enrolled in “Men and Women” and took “History of Sexuality” with Cott last semester, writes in an email. “In addition to giving meaningful context to daily life, her classes have entirely changed the way I think about sexuality and gender.”
“As a historian, she does provide unbiased historical background for the subjects. Yet, perhaps due to her rhetoric and passion, her classes have inspired me to become more concerned about women’s rights.”
She ends her lecture and opens herself up to more questions, but this time the questions seek out the vast knowledge she has at her command rather than her motives.

When the first snowstorm hit Cambridge last Thursday night, Professor Emeritus of Japanese Jay Rubin was in Japan, enjoying the sunrise and the balmy 65-degree weather. Rubin is a self-professed lover of Japan; he is best known as the primary translator of Haruki Murakami, the Japanese jazz-bar owner turned best-selling author of 12 full-length novels and short-story collections.
Rubin first came to Japan as a Fulbright scholar and lived there for two years. Now he lives in Seattle, but he still goes to Japan sporadically.
“My wife is Japanese and my children are half Japanese,” Rubin says. “I’m deeply involved, let’s put it that way.”
Rubin started learning Japanese, rather belatedly, at the age of 19, when he had a free quarter and decided to take a non-Western class. Later, he received a Ph.D. in Japanese literature from the University of Chicago before teaching at the University of Washington in Seattle and then coming to Harvard.
OPEN MIND 
Rubin first saw Murakami as he ran the Boston Marathon in the early 90s, and the pair officially met in a classroom at Harvard. Rubin was a Visiting Professor at the time; he was co-teaching a class with Howard Hibbett, the Victor S. Thomas Professor Emeritus of Japanese Literature. Hibbett learned that Rubin had just translated a work of Murakami into English, and decided to hold a class discussion with both the author and the translator.
“We were yelling at each other from across the table,” Rubin says. “It was fun.”
Over the next 20 years, as Rubin translated four of Murakami’s novels and many of his short stories, the two became friends. Rubin’s first Murakami project, “The Second Bakery Attack,” was a short story published in Playboy Magazine in 1992. His latest translation is “1Q84,” which was published at the end of October.
The book, which is about 1000 pages in length and a foot in thickness, deals with themes of loneliness, alienation, and the quest for identity—the very themes that have come to characterize the Murakami novel.
But according to Rubin, Murakami is a very optimistic writer. “His characters are always open to the world, learning new things, and having an open mind. As bad as they feel, suicide is never an option,” Rubin said.
ANOTHER WORLD
The title of “1Q84” is a bilingual reference to George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” as the letter Q in English is pronounced like the number nine in Japanese. Orwell, like Franz Kafka and Raymond Chandler, is one of a number of Western authors who have influenced Murakami.
“Murakami’s a bookworm,” Rubin says. “It can be annoying, actually, because you’re with him in a room, and the next thing you know he’s pulled out a book to read.”
Murakami acknowledges the influence of Western writers on his work, and he himself has translated many of their books into Japanese. Still, Rubin maintains that “1Q84” is fundamentally different from Orwell’s masterpiece.
“There’s some overlap in the theme of mind control and the strong position regarding religion and religious cults,” Rubin says. “But it’s utterly different from ‘1984.’”
Rubin has dabbled in a number of things, including teaching and writing—he’s authored a few books, including a chronicle of Murakami’s life and career titled “Murakami and the Music of Words.” Now his main job is babysitting for his grown children. In the end, though, Rubin is still first and foremost a translator.
“Translating is fun, I really enjoy it,” Rubin says. “I love getting the images and ideas into my head and see how they come out in English. It’s not a mechanical process; otherwise I wouldn’t be doing it.”
In a recent interview with The New Yorker, Rubin advised people not to read literature in translation, a paradoxical move for a professional translator.
“I’m not saying that people should stop reading translated works; that’d be bad for world culture,” Rubin says. “What they should do is learn more languages—especially Americans. We should learn what it’s like to live in another language.”

Lingering around a dining hall table after dinner one October evening, a group of Kirkland seniors recalls Election Day, 2008. For Talia B. Lavin ’12, what defined that November night was the euphoria.
“We ran around in the streets, watching the election results,” she says. “I called them joy riots at the time. We stopped the traffic, jumped up on cars ...” Her friends laugh. “... OK, maybe didn’t jump up on cars.”
Anne Y. Polyakov ’12 agrees about the atmosphere. “There were lots of drunk people,” she adds.
“I was putting off my Chinese homework to watch all this,” adds Jeffrey M. Epstein ’12.
The political discussion turns to the present day.
“I think a lot of people are disillusioned with Obama,” says Lavin. “He promised to be a promoter of change.”
“He did some things ...” begins Polyakov. Lavin interrupts, “We didn’t elect him as a compromiser.”
“That might be because we misunderstood him,” Joanna Y. Li ’12 counters. “Was it possible to have done any of this right?”
“It’s hard to misunderstand hope, change,” says Lavin. “I was really gung-ho, and now ...” She trails off. The conversation stops.
It’s a natural pause in tracing the trajectory of the current president, from his 2008 campaign and election to the current state of the union. Not all Harvard students supported Obama in 2008. Not all who did are disappointed with him now. But in a Crimson poll a week before the election, 82 percent of students indicated that they intended to vote for Obama, and 11 percent that they intended to vote for McCain.
In this sense, Harvard reflects a broader national trend. Shortly after taking office, Obama had an 84 percent approval rating among voters ages 18 to 29. By this past August the figure was 52 percent. Last week, a Democracy Corps poll had the rating at 40 percent.
That things have changed is undeniable. It’s a change from which the student body has not been exempt. Three years ago Cambridge residents and Harvard students took to the streets, making traffic stop, singing the national anthem. Those who were freshmen then are about to graduate. Today, near the end of an administration, doubts have appeared about Obama in his supporters, necessitating a new way of negotiating the divide between Obama and us.

Lavin classes herself among the disillusioned. The 2008 election was the first in which she could vote. Initially, she saw Obama as a chance for a “clean slate.”
“During the Bush era we’d had the continual expansion of the power of the presidency, and the pretty egregious violations that came with that,” says Lavin. “There was the sense that Obama ... would actively dismantle that structure.”
To her, the structure has persisted. “I think [Obama] came in on a platform of very broad promises,” she says. Instead of making good on them, “he set about making himself a compromiser—and a compromiser in a time when the opposition is more radical than it’s been.”
Lavin is not alone in drawing this distinction: an expectation of rigid idealism set against a duller reality of compromise.
Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92, a senior lecturer at the Kennedy School, sketches a similar portrait. “I think [Obama] promised a certain kind of presidency,” he says, “and became a different kind of president.”
Ganz, who had played a key role in developing the Obama campaign’s grassroots organizing model, diagnosed this distinction in a Los Angeles Times article published on Nov. 3, 2010, entitled “How Obama lost his voice, and how he can get it back.” In the article he contrasted Obama’s “transformational” leadership style during the campaign with a “transactional” one as president.
After the election, says Ganz, “He seemed to think that that required him to be a mediator; to be unclear about what direction he was leading in; to somehow try to create some bipartisan thing that there was no basis for.”
“He lost tremendous ground,” Ganz concludes, “not because of a specific policy failure, but because of a leadership failure—and that’s really hard to make up.”
James T. Kloppenberg, Charles Warren Professor of American History, places the blame elsewhere.
“When President Obama was elected,” says Kloppenberg, “a lot of people projected onto him their own hopes for a dramatic transformation of American politics and American culture.”
Obama was always a compromiser, says Kloppenberg, whose book, “Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Tradition,” traces the sources of this characteristic through the people and ideas that have influenced the president. A pragmatist at heart, Obama “doesn’t believe in the existence of absolute truth”; rather, “he recognizes that you move in the direction of the truer point of view through the juxtaposition of contesting arguments.”
Within such a system, change can be only gradual, evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The lack of a clear majority of Congressional Democrats in the second two years of his first term could only prolong this interval. Young people are disappointed, then, because “they expected more from him than he was ever going to deliver,” says Kloppenberg.
“If people had known him better, they would have had more realistic expectations,” says Kloppenberg. “And if they had a more sophisticated understanding of how American politics works, their hopes wouldn’t have been as high in the first place.”
High hopes, or at least high expectations, certainly characterized the 2008 campaign. Adam B. Kern ’13, who identifies as a Republican (more precisely, a classical liberal), acknowledges that the excitement of Obama’s candidacy stemmed largely from his connection to ideas and ideals. “I did feel kind of threatened by this candidate,” says Kern. “He was promising a lot, and I was really afraid that he was going to deliver on it—there was a very real sense that he could.”
In that sense, says Kern, “I was glad to see him come down to earth.”
The same aspects of Obama and his campaign that seemed to strike a chord with many young liberals were, unsurprisingly, anathema to conservatives. “Part of the conservative scorn for Obama when he was a candidate—and he ran on this platform of change—is that it was so vague,” says Kern.
From the other side of the spectrum, Jonathan M. L. Rosenthal ’13 coincides in the feeling that Obama’s campaign was more ideological than concrete. “He represented this ideal of hopefulness and change,” says Rosenthal. “There was a sense that if he got elected it would represent a shift toward a more reasonable form of politics and away from a sort of partisan hackery.”
Instead, says Rosenthal, Obama allowed the ideal to wither through compromise in negotiations with Congress. “He started the compromise from a weaker position than he ought to have done,” says Rosenthal, “and that’s resulted in policies that at times seem more like Republican policies than Democratic policies.”
Rosenthal concedes that this emphasis may not have been a complete surprise. “He certainly talked a lot about compromise in the election,” he says, “... but on the other hand, I think a lot of people on the left still thought of him as a strong fighter for liberal policies. I think that he is not—at least he has not appeared to fight enough for liberal policies.”
As in any presidency, political grievances among the youth (and the general population) are numerous, varied, and complex. In one sense, the different versions of “our Obama” are vital in making sense of Obama as a president and of the policies of his administration. In another sense, however, who Obama is and what he stands for is less significant than how he is perceived. The American youth, the 18-29 voting bloc, saw something in Obama that they latched onto (or in fewer cases, were repulsed by), characterizations and ideals and images that he was seen as emblematizing in some presidential way. These images were always mired in subjectivity: perhaps they were justified projections, perhaps naïve ones. Perhaps the images say less about Obama than they do about his followers, disciples, and detractors themselves.
***
Peter D. Davis ’12 is less disillusioned than indignant. He finds it difficult to sit still while talking, impossible to sit while talking about politics: leaning forward, sitting back, then springing forward again. Sometimes he adds a chuckle, shaking his head, as if to show how self-evident his arguments are. At one point he cites the 2.5 million Americans who sleep in a prison every night. He brings up Woodrow Wilson, FDR, comparing and contrasting their policies and leadership styles with Obama’s. He quotes Lincoln.
Davis believes change is still necessary, and he wants to help bring it about. He is indignant because he thought Obama would enable him and others like him to “solve the great problems of our time,” a phrase he often repeats. He is indignant because he thinks this hasn’t happened.
“We had 40 years of not much happening in the country with regard to youth activism in the left,” Davis begins. He speaks with some nostalgia concerning youth involvement in the 1960s, on Martin Luther King, on sit-ins and marches. “We’re grasping at wanting to have equally big lives,” he says, “equally important lives.”
Departing from the skepticism of the previous, “postmodern,” generation, as he calls it, Davis felt that his would be “a problem-solving generation—and Obama talked about that.”
In 2006, Davis skipped school one morning to drive a group of people out to the primary, “because I thought things would be different.”
Several factors ended, as Davis puts it, “my relationship with Barack.”
Part of it is what he sees as the failure of some of Obama’s loftier campaign goals to materialize: “No attempt to restructure how Washington works, even though that was a major part of his campaign. No campaign finance reform, no ethics changes, no making sure lobbyists have less power.”
Another piece, however, has more to do with his own relationship to politics: how he fits in, or would like to.
“I get emails every week,” Davis says, “that either ask me to donate money to the [Democratic National Committee], or go out and door-knock for the midterms, or go out and donate money to Obama’s campaign.”
“All we are to them, which is all we are to any other campaign, is money and votes and boots on the ground. The number one mobilization of the president should not be to help him and his party; it should be to get us to be better citizens.”
Davis is unhappy with Obama’s presidency not only because of specific policies (he brings up health care reform: Obama’s invitation to lobbyist Billy Tauzin to the White House, after having publicly disparaged Tauzin during the campaign). He also wants to act, to enact change, on his own account. Davis sees the youth as possessing a strong potential and will for civic action: he sees Obama as having failed to tap into this current, after appropriating it so successfully during the campaign.
“I don’t want this to come off as negative,” Davis adds. “Because I’m actually more hopeful than ever that we’re going to solve the great problems of our time.”
To Davis, Obama has only a peripheral role to play in a new paradigm of change.
“In the end, we should decide to solve these problems,” he says. “Elections are one tool we can use to solve public problems ... It’s not the only tool we have.”
“We can start innovative tech startups, we can convince civic associations to solve problems.” Or, Davis says, “we can start tent cities in the middle of Zuccotti Park.”
***
On Sept. 17, some disgruntled citizens took matters into their own hands. The half-acre grounds of Zuccotti Park, originally called Liberty Plaza Park, a name some protesters are now reverting to, was quickly covered in sleeping bags and camping tents, protest signs and banners. The media attention concerning the protest has only grown, perhaps reaching a crescendo with a mass march over the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in approximately 700 arrests. The protests have spread worldwide, including to Boston’s Dewey Square.
Davis was there and gave a speech. Lavin performed with a student group, and witnessed the police action on the night when police arrested 129 protesters, including at least five Harvard students and alumni.
Davis cites the movement as an example of an alternative to reliance on electoral politics.
While the diversity of the Occupy movement has increased since it began, youth involvement and intensity have continued to play a central role. Yet youth participation in extra-governmental movements or protests is hardly new. For Ganz, in fact, what was striking about youth involvement in the 2008 Obama campaign was that it took place within, rather than beyond, the electoral system.
“Young people are very much engaged in movements,” he says: “civil rights, the environment, the women’s movement.”
Ganz cites Protestant theologian Walter Brueggemann, whose book “The Prophetic Imagination” points to two sources of transformational energy: on the one hand criticality, or a reasoned assessment of limits, and on the other, hope. “Young people come of age with a critical eye on the world they find,” he notes, “but with almost incessantly hopeful hearts—which means that there is an energy in youth for change and social transformation.” Criticality plus hope: for Ganz, it is a formula that has driven social movements for decades, if not centuries. It can be seen in the French Revolution; in the American civil rights movement; in the Arab Spring.
Part of Obama’s success in 2008, he says, stemmed from his ability to harness such idealistic energy, and steer it back into the political system. This energy was channeled into avenues like social networking initiatives, an army of volunteers, and a record-high voter turnout.
“Obama has a lot to be grateful to young people for,” says Ganz. But he questions whether Obama will be as lucky the second time around.
“I don’t see any evidence that that’s there again,” says Ganz. “People were clamoring to come work for Obama in 2007 and 2008. Maybe that’s happening.” He shrugs. “I haven’t heard about it.”
That doesn’t mean, however, that the transformational energy Ganz is talking about will disappear. “That energy was movement energy,” he says. Rather than fading, it is more likely to be redirected: “We’re seeing some of it pop up in these occupations all over the place.”
The “energy” Ganz discusses was an unmistakable aspect of the 2008 campaign: it was part of what supporters called hopefulness, potential for change; part of what naysayers called vagueness or lack of direction. Throughout the 2008 campaign there was much talk about the youth as a single bloc: the youth movement, the youth mobilization, the youth vote.
Ganz is one of many who doubt the continued existence of such a bloc. Many young people care passionately about a single issue, whether social, environmental, or economic, rather than about “politics” in general. What Ganz calls “movement energy” stems from a critical mass of youth involvement directed toward a single one of these issues: which in 2008, uncommonly, happened to be the election of a candidate. If the youthful energy directed toward Obama has splintered back into energy directed toward specific issues, change becomes contingent upon the experiences and opinions of individual youths, rather than upon a homogenous and indistinguishable mass.
Apart from the Occupy movement’s status as a reaction to increasing inequality and the corporate responsibility for it, the nebulousness of its demands presents, to some, an alternative to change within a political framework.
To frame the movement as an either-or scenario would be an oversimplification: no one spoken to for this article planned not to vote, and the liberal students interviewed all said they would “probably” vote for Obama. Populist protests and civic initiatives will continue to coexist and overlap with youth involvement in more traditional politics. The shift is rather one of inflection. It suggests a redirection of the transformational energy Ganz talks about: a renewed emphasis by young people on movements beyond government, rather than within it.
***
For Lavin, the Occupy Movement is “the most visible image of this political disillusionment on a massive scale, particularly for youth.”
“What really draws me in,” she says, “is the sense that a lot of the inequities that America is facing are too big to be solved by one man—by one presidency—and really are systemic.”
Lavin is not entirely convinced that the movement offers a comprehensive alternative to change within the electoral system. “I do question the efficacy of a mass movement in working out reforms of a very complex financial system,” she says.
Yet she continues to be attracted to the idealistic bent of the Occupy movement. “For the first time since civil rights,” she says, “it’s really brought back justice into the political arena. It’s brought back inequities within American society. It’s brought back issues like compassion and the social contract.”
Issues, the insinuation is, that were worthy of a recently-elected Obama but seem to be getting compromised over today. In their absence, perhaps the youth are looking for a different direction.
“Since freshman year, I’ve become a thousand times more political,” says Lavin. She smiles and qualifies: “By which I mean more informed, more willing and able to form coherent political opinions.”
She adds, “Disillusionment with the administration was part of my political education.”

Jeffrey D. Sachs ’76 is the Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia, an advisor to the United Nations, and one of the youngest Economics professors in Harvard’s history. He talks to FM about virtue, occupation, and intellectual struggle.
1. Fifteen Minutes: Your new book, which came out earlier this month, is called “The Price of Civilization: Reawakening American Virtue and Prosperity.” Let’s start with that title, an allusion to Oliver Wendell Homes, Jr. who said, “Taxes are the price we pay for civilization.” What do you believe is the price of civilization? Is it just taxes?
Jeffrey Sachs: I believe a commitment to civic virtue includes a regard for one’s community, one’s country, and the world. Paying taxes is part of that, but so are obeying the laws and promoting laws that are good for the community. And I think we have lost those civic virtues at the top of American society—or at least diminished them in recent decades. We are suffering badly as a result of that. We are in a society that is increasingly lawbreaking and corrupt in key institutions.
2. FM: That sounds pretty daunting. Which are the corrupt institutions to look out for?
JS: We’ve seen many scandals around stock options in compensations. We’ve seen many scandals around accounting. Recently, on Wall Street, we saw fraudulent financial behavior that contributed to the financial bubble and ultimately to a disastrous collapse. In recent months, major Wall Street companies have paid large fines to the SEC for having fraudulently packaged and sold bundles of securities that they knew were going to fail ... But even though fines have been paid, I’m not sure how much accountability has been achieved. The fines were generally small fractions of the profits that were earned in this bubble. I worry that the moral hazard of having behaved this way—having been bailed out, having incurred modest fines—may actually be encouragement to more recklessness.
3. FM: Virtues are another part of your book’s title. What kinds of virtues need to be reawakened in these corrupt institutions?
JS: Well, I talk about virtues at many different levels. Aristotle and Buddha are two of the sages I refer to in the book in order to emphasize that, at an individual level, virtue involves a middle path between asceticism and hyper-consumerism. And I discuss in the book my feelings about American society becoming hyper-commercial. At the individual level it becomes dangerous, as we have all become vulnerable to the weight of advertising and the remarkable amount of TV watching ...
4. FM: You mentioned Buddha as a model for individual virtue. Buddha created his Eight-Fold Path, and in your book the solution you prescribe to American economic upheaval is a set of eight goals: a sort of Jeffrey Sachs Eight-Fold Path. Is that all a coincidence?
JS: Well, both Buddha’s Eight-Fold path and the eight goals I recommend in the book share a similar purpose in bringing the long-term to attention. Right now in the U.S. we are so relentlessly short-term in our debates, discussions, and policy-making that we have lost sight of the longer-term purposes.
5. FM: You have always played a large role in promoting the Millennium Development Goals. There were also eight of those, right?
JS: Yes, and you know with the Millennium Development Goals, those have been enormously helpful in organizing action—in helping countries to focus on important things. Even if countries don’t get there on time, and many will not, the greater intention to inspire crucial efforts like fighting poverty, hunger, and disease has kept up enormously.
6 FM: So you think that setting goals makes a significant difference in how countries ultimately act?
JS: Yes, definitely.
7. FM: For example?
JS: It’s a commonplace observation, but it has not been corrected [that] we have substituted the measure of GNP for many things that are more important in our lives and in our economy.
8. FM: In your book you mention Bhutan’s King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, whom you admire for suggesting the concept of “Gross National Happiness” as being significantly more telling than Gross National Product. Happiness is a pretty out-there idea. What do you believe it really is?
JS: There are two ways happiness has been measured in recent years. One is called affective happiness, which is people’s moods, emotions, and sense of well-being. The other is called evaluative happiness, which is the sense that people have about the overall satisfaction of their lives. I find the latter to be more relevant. A number of countries are measuring evaluative happiness; they are asking people: “Are you satisfied with your life?” There are different ways of asking this, and the answers offer a lot. You find there is consistency within countries and there are patterns that reveal what people need for a deeper life satisfaction. Income plays a role, but a diminishing role: after a reasonable level of income, according to studies, it has no affect on overall happiness. A feeling of trust in the community plays a role as well. There is a lot of evidence that quality of life in the workplace means a lot. I think that this notion of looking seriously at life satisfaction and its determinants is illuminating.
9. FM: “The Price of Civilization” is peculiar among your wide academic repertoire in that it focuses on domestic economic issues whereas you typically have written on foreign economies. Why the sudden interest in the U.S. economy?
JS: After the financial crisis so many questions arose that needed answering and over the last more than a decade I felt that on the international scene the U.S. was being less and less effective in playing a constructive role, much less a leadership role. I had very much growing concerns about problems in the U.S.: the growing poor, the fact that the U.S. educational system is lagging behind. As I watched this happen, I decided it was really time to write something more than some essays. That was the motivation for researching and writing this book.
10. FM: With the U.S. falling off the cannon as a leader, are there any foreign countries people should specifically be looking towards as a better role model?
JS: I think different countries have done different things I admire ... I do view favorably the balanced approaches of the northern European countries. I think that the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland have shown an admirable balance of respect for free market trade but also attention to social equity as well as to environmental sustainability. I find that that kind of balanced approach makes a great deal of sense, and I am attracted to that. While those countries are not models for the U.S. because the U.S. is so much bigger and diverse, I still feel that those countries help to give some interesting and pertinent examples for how things could be better in the United States.
11. FM: How about the Occupy movement going on right now? Is there anything you specifically hope to see come out of it?
JS: I think the basic message of the Occupy movement—“We are the 99%”—is really channeling an important truth of American society right now. Over the past 30 years, the top has gotten a lot richer: the top of the top, by the way, has gotten phenomenally rich. And now it is not just wealth and income at the top but also political power. Increasingly, that power has twisted our public policy, emphasizing the cutting of taxes, and even in the danger of slashing public services and public investments. I think it has been extremely dangerous and shortsighted. The Occupy movement is, I think, the beginning of awareness and I hope it is the beginning of change in American politics.
12. FM: Have you been down to Wall Street to march with the protestors?
JS: I’ve actually been there several times, and I’ve spoken there. I told them that I think they are on the right track.
13. FM: You are now at the vanguard of global economic thinking, but looking back to when you were a Harvard undergraduate, what prompted you to pursue economics and global development?
JS: I was lucky after high school to travel before entering college. I spent some time travelling in Europe. It was my first time seeing different societies. I spent some time on the other side of the Iron Curtain. I saw how puzzling and different Soviet-style socialism was. And I was completely fascinated by the fact that different places I had seen had different approaches to things. I wanted to know what works and what doesn’t work. Those were the beginning days for me.
14: FM: And what about when you got to Harvard?
A few weeks before freshman week, we had a list of books sent to us and we were asked to read “Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy” by Joseph Schumpeter and to go to a lecture in Sanders Theater by Daniel Patrick Moyinhan. I read that book. I don’t think I understood almost any of it, but I found it completely fascinating. My head was spinning by the time I came to Harvard with all these questions about economics. I started Ec. 10, and never looked back. That was 39 years ago.
15. FM: Any final words of wisdom for students currently studying economics?
JS: The thing that worked for me, I must say, is that I came into the field asking big questions because I found them completely fascinating and I never gave up on trying to grapple with those questions. As one is flogging through economics sometimes, one loses sight of the big picture because it all seems pretty esoteric and technical. Things don’t seem to relate to a lot of the questions you were asking. Sometimes people give up on those questions. Sometimes advisors say that it’s one thing to think about big issues, but you’ve got to write this paper or that paper and to focus in and so on. There’s often an element of truth to that, but I think the most exciting thing about social science is that it is the field that grapples with the greatest questions—about society after all. If you go into this field, remember that you went into it because you found the big questions fascinating, and don’t lose that appetite for digging big and inquiring about difficult issues. It’s worth the intellectual struggle.

When Pforzheimer House residents return to the Quad come spring semester, they will return to an entirely revamped Junior Common Room.
The two-step renovation—which House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 described as “long overdue” in an email to Pfoho residents on Tuesday—is scheduled to begin over winter break.
The first stage will involve modest modifications to the space’s visual appearance, including a fresh coat of paint and new carpeting and tiles.
The House will also purchase new lighting, which the Masters described as a “hanging light fixture that looks sort of like a big web or a cloud and has colored LED lights around it,” as well as new furniture.
The House Masters wrote that different floor coverings will demarcate the JCR into three “zones” which students can use for a variety of activities such as eating, playing darts, watching TV, or hosting big events. The space will also be outfitted with arcade game machines.
The second stage, which the Masters wrote would not start for “a couple of years,” involves architectural changes aimed at integrating the Quad Grille into the larger JCR space. Although the Grille is currently adjacent to the common room, the two spaces are separated by a wall that will be torn down during a future renovation.
The Masters described their design decisions as “driven by cost issues, primarily” and indicated that the second stage of renovations would not begin until the House is able to procure sufficient funds for the project.
The money for the first phase of renovations will come from House funds, as well as money Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds allocated as part of a larger initiative to improve student social space throughout the Houses.
Hammonds recently identified the Pfoho JCR and Quad Grille—as well as the Eliot House Grille, the first floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, and Cabot Cafe—as spaces in need of “substantial enhancements.”
According to House Committee Co-chair Maya C. Ayoub ’12, the House Masters solicited input from students over the house email list while finalizing plans for the new common space. A committee of students worked with the House Masters and architects to arrive at the final design for the room.
Ayoub said that the new JCR will be more accessible and modern, making it “a good place for students to hang out and study.”
“I envision seeing a lot of cool HoCo events [there] in the future,” she said.
The Masters wrote in their email that improvements to the House, which include the renovations to the JCR, as well as the creation of a “Pfoto” and videography lab, “will enable us to do more creative programming.”
“I think it’s a great idea,” Pfoho resident Tasnoba Nusrat ’13 said. “I think it will create a little more cohesion in the Quad and a stronger sense of community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pforzheimer House journalist-in-residence John N. Bohannon held a video chat with Kabul-based journalist and American University of Afghanistan professor Mitch E. Sipus on Wednesday afternoon to discuss Sipus’s experiences as an American living in Afghanistan.
Bohannon, who was based in Afghanistan last year and wrote an article for Science Magazine concerning civilian death counts in the region, decided to open the video chat to the public because he thought Sipus’s role in Kabul deserved wider recognition.
Though Sipus is currently a computer science professor, he is helping to create a communications degree at AUAF. Next fall, the university will also open a law school.
Sipus said he thinks such opportunities are a must for AUAF.
“We’re creating the next generation of Afghan leaders,” Sipus said. “If they can learn a bit more about how to work with each other and how to implement a solution, then when the aid groups leave there won’t be an avalanche of problems.”
Though Sipus’s work at AUAF was a focal point of the chat, he also discussed daily life and the sometimes unconventional safety measures necessary for the volatile environment.
“I rely on Twitter for security more than any other asset,” Sipus said, noting that Afghan journalists will tweet about bombings within minutes, while Western news sources will often take hours.
Sipus added that observing his students has also been a valuable source of information.
“If there’s a day I get to campus and there are no students there, then I’m going to go home,” Sipus said. “They probably know something I don’t.”
In fact, Sipus said he believes that a more “student-centric” approach to Afghan security in general would be effective.
The event, which was open to the entire Harvard community, drew a sparse audience.
Pforzheimer resident tutor Neal A. Dach, an Iraqi war veteran, found the details of day-to-day life intriguing.
“It looks like conditions are a little better than they were in Baghdad in 2003,” Dach said.
Bohannon likewise found the video chat to be a beneficial experience, citing Sipus’s use of Twitter as a particularly fascinating detail.
“I was going to talk to this guy anyway,” Bohannon said. “Now the things he talked about will radiate out.”

Thomas J. Stohlman, Jr. is a nerd, and proud of it. An MIT graduate with degrees in architecture and chemical engineering, Stohlman sees his education and professional experience as an important selling point in his campaign for a seat on the Cambridge City Council.
“I’m a tall, middle-aged white guy who wears bow ties and glasses,” Stohlman said with a smile in an interview for Cambridge Community Television during his previous election bid in 2009.
Stohlman does not accept campaign contributions and instead instructs potential donors to give the funds to “the Cambridge charity of your choice.”
Through his rational, balanced approach to policy issues, Stohlman says he hopes to find success against more established candidates in this year’s election.
Stohlman says his speciality—and the area in which he is most experienced—is civic planning and budget distribution. He is a self-described “budget wonk,” and his training in architecture has made him an expert on matters such as land use and public transportation.
Stohlman supports zoning initiatives which he believes will “save energy, reduce crime, and improve everyone’s quality of life,” according to a statement written on his campaign blog. In addition, Stohlman has pushed for redesigning public roads and sidewalks to reduce traffic and to make parking easier.
Outside his interest in Cambridge’s infrastructure, Stohlman has also expressed his support for increased funding for senior programs and recreational facilities for youth.
A father of three, Stohlman was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and moved to Cambridge in 1972 to study at MIT. He is currently a practicing architect, though he promises to make the City Council his only full-time job if elected.
Stohlman has provided free architectural consulting to the Cambridge Public Library in the past, and his firm specializes in residential and energy-conscious design. Stohlman emphasizes his budget expertise and familiarity with the city’s finances during his campaign, pointing to his time on the Cambridge Superintendent’s Budget Advisory Committee.
“Cambridge is a well-off town,” Stohlman says, “and we’re not having to make tough decisions about how to spend that money.”  Stohlman would use his experience in budgeting and Cambridge financing to fund initiatives for economic growth, such as investing in “high tech and entrepreneurial office space.”
He ran unsuccessfully for one of the nine City Council seats in 2009, but has since redoubled his efforts to win the hearts and minds of Cambridge voters.
His website states that he wants to “govern by walking around,” and his intimate style of leadership is reflected in his campaign strategy.
An avid walker, Stohlman sent out hundreds of handwritten postcards to Cambridge residents all over the city, featuring scenic views of the Charles River and other sights in the area. And throughout the entire campaign, Stohlman has hit the streets to meet with the people. Stohlman also maintains a website, Facebook account, Twitter account, and YouTube channel to connect with voters.
In addition to emphasizing his affection for Cambridge, Stohlman uses his quirky sense of humor to help endear himself to voters. In one of his YouTube videos, for example, he wears Groucho Marx-style novelty glasses, and in another he shows off his collection of bow ties, his signature fashion item.
“From space, Cambridge looks like a giant green bow tie,” Stohlman jokes in the video, pointing out where various Cambridge landmarks would be located on his bow tie.
Stohlman describes himself as “a shy and modest person who’d rather hear about you.” He also says he has no interest in negative campaigning.
When asked about each of his opponents in the upcoming election, Stohlman had nothing but kind words.
“Gary Mello is not a politician, and that’s a good thing, because it’s hard to shake the politician’s blinders from our eyes and see new ways to solve old problems,” Stohlman says of one of his opponents. The most combative he gets is a humorous swipe at Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, as written on his Twitter account: “Will Scott Brown be as effective in the U.S. Senate as he was in the Massachusetts Senate? My guess is yes. It’s easy to do nothing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of players huddle around four Scrabble boards near the back of Annenberg. As dozens of students enjoyed a typical Tuesday night Brain Break, the Harvard College Scrabble Club quietly held its first-ever meeting in Annenberg Hall.
Since the College extended the hours that Annenberg is open to students in mid-September, some freshmen say they have been taking advantage of the later hours.
Matt J. Pawlowski ’15, who helped organize Tuesday night’s scrabble, said the club chose Annenberg as a meeting spot because of its open space, central location, and large tables. Without Annenberg, Pawlowski said the club would probably meet in a smaller freshman dorm common room or an upperclassmen house.
Attendance figures show that since Annenberg extended its hours to stay open from 4:30 p.m. to midnight five days a week, between 200 and 300 freshmen have swiped into Annenberg each night, with attendance figures reaching close to 400 on several occasions, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
But Annenberg officials have not distinguished between students arriving during the new hours and traditional brain break hours.
“The program just launched and it is too early to fully determine its overall success,” Neal wrote in an emailed statement. “The College will examine the program at a later date to develop a fuller understanding.”
Neal added that the extended hours have thus far been deemed successful.
Students interviewed in Annenberg said that they visit the dining hall for brain break and then stay for the extended hours. Some also said they use the space to study in the hours after brain break ends.
Joshua S. Chmara ’15 said he stops by Annenberg every night, usually with a group of friends to get a snack.
He said he usually stops by during brain break and has only been in the dining hall once or twice after 11 p.m.
While students say they appreciate having Annenberg as an option, they say it has drawbacks as a study space.
“It’s too noisy here. I can’t really work here,” Richard A. Lopez ’15 said. “If I’m going to do work I don’t really want to be in an environment that’s going to distract me.”
Annenberg’s extended hours are part of a larger effort by the College to increase social spaces for students on campus. Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 explained that the extension is the result of student feedback and consultation, particularly with the Freshmen Space Working Group—a group of students and administrators charged last year with brainstorming ways to enhance social spaces for freshmen.
The group originally suggested extending Annenberg’s hours in a report to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds last spring.
Dingman explained that a lack of social space can hurt a class’s sense of community.
“You’re here primarily to pursue your scholarly aims, but I think you can be more effective if you take some breaks from the academic rigor of the place,” Dingman said.
He added that administrators recognize that Annenberg is not the end-all social space.
“I don’t think it meets all of the needs that students have expressed,” said Dingman of Annenberg. “That doesn’t come as a surprise to us. Students over time have said that they’d like a room that’s really comfortable where you can kick back ... Those options just don’t exist in Annenberg.”

When asked to reflect on his eventful 22 years on the Cambridge City Council, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 turns to a cardboard box filled with old pictures and handwritten letters.
Flipping through the photos, the two-time mayor is particularly struck by one image.
“This is former City Councilor and my major enemy Bill Walsh, the person on the Council with whom I had the most antagonistic relationship possible,” Reeves began. “He was adamantly against rent control, and I was the king of rent control. But strangely enough ... we became extraordinarily close friends. More like brothers than anything else.”
Reeves recalled that the two bonded over caring for their elderly mothers, and Walsh became one of Reeves’ biggest supporters before passing away last year. Walsh’s death—in addition to the recent deaths of other long-time supporters—has made this campaign feel a bit different for Reeves.
“This campaign is for me one that has some significant losses,” Reeves said.
Despite the loss of key supporters and assistants, Reeves says his campaign strategy is basically the same as it was during his first run for office in 1989, when campaign events were captured with Polaroid photos.
“An interesting thing about Cambridge is that in certain neighborhoods ... 74 to 76 percent of residents have lived here for five years or less,” Reeves says. “That means in every two-year election cycle, you really are introducing yourself. There are people who don’t know anything about 1989, many people. It makes it important for you to treat each election as a fresh opportunity.”
A majority of residents may be newcomers to the area, but Reeves certainly is not. The Detroit native made his way to Cambridge more than 40 years ago when he came to Harvard College.
In an era of racial turmoil—when Harvard was admitting the largest number of black students to date—Reeves and his classmates helped establish the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College-the oldest existing black organization at the College-as well as blackCAST, a theatrical group established to promote Black theater. Reeves’ class was also pivotal in establishing a department of African and African American Studies.
“When I came to Harvard, we said we’d like to have a department of African American Studies,” Reeves said. “They just couldn’t imagine how you could have a department because there wasn’t enough to look at, and that’s coming from a school with a discipline in Folklore and Mythology. To go from that response to perhaps one of the most discussed departments in the University now. To have seen that in a lifetime is to have seen how the world can change.”
Forty years later, Reeves is still active in developing African-American education. One worn picture serves as evidence: a portrait of Reeves grinning at the home W.E.B. Du Bois in Ghana. He considers Du Bois to be a role model and is one of his favorite people in history.
Reeves himself is a lauded figure in Cambridge’s African-American community, according to George Greenidge, a local resident who has collaborated with Reeves on a number of projects, most significantly during Greenidge’s time as the director of a youth center in Area Four, which covers Central Square.
“Ken woke up young people by being [mayor] and saying we have a role in government,” Greenidge says. “He got blacks and Latinos engaged in government.”
In 1992, Reeves became the first black mayor of Cambridge, and the first openly gay black mayor in the country.
Though Reeves does not emphasize his minority statuses, he has been a longtime advocate for the local African-American and homosexual communities, helping to found the organizations Men of Color Against AIDS (MOCAA) in Boston, the Men of Color Health Task Force in Cambridge, and the Gay and Lesbian Elected Officials (GLBLO) Caucus of the National League of Cities.
Recently, Reeves has organized community conversations on police brutality towards blacks and other social justice issues. Reeves supports these causes in more concrete ways as well.
“Every day I can, I stop by Boomerangs. It provides a mental break,” Reeves said, peering into the well-lit Central Square thrift store that is owned and operated by the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts.
In addition to minority activism, Reeves spent much of his last term working on commercial viability and quality of life issues in Cambridge. He was appointed to head a commission this past year to help revitalize Central Square, and held monthly meetings with residents and other stakeholders.
While getting over 100 citizens, real estate owners, and store managers to cooperate might have been difficult, one participant praised Reeves for his leadership. Alan Zimwicke, who runs a real estate development business focusing on affordable housing, called the latest planning efforts “ingenious.”
“Ken looked at ... what other cities have thought about doing and kept the interest of over 100 people while going about things in unique ways,” Zimwicke said. “He is tenacious in the way he cares and he really sticks with it.”
Recently, Reeves has also focused on education, establishing a “baby university” to help educate parents, championing the renovation of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, and supporting the construction of a new main library branch that has won awards for elegant architecture.
On the whole, Reeves says his goal is to improve the quality of life for residents. While many Harvard graduates spread out around the world, Reeves has built a foundation of support within blocks of his undergraduate dorm.
“I have black mothers and white mothers. This is the white mother, Janet Daly,” Reeves remarks, holding up a photo of an elderly woman. “She and her husband Joe have been with me from the beginning ... They called themselves the ‘Daly Double.”’
And it’s not just a select few Cantabrigians who Reeves connects with, associates say.
“If you ever see him walking in Central Square, he’s a total magnet,” Greenidge remarked. “People are always coming up to him. He knows how to relate to people.”

Building his campaign on his carpenter background and his Cambridge roots, Gregg J. Moree is hoping that third time is the charm as he runs for Cambridge City Council for the third straight election.
Moree says that over the last 22 years, he has worked as a carpenter at many buildings throughout Cambridge and Harvard University, including Memorial Hall and Harvard Law School. Born and raised in Cambridge, he attended the M.E. Fitzgerald Elementary School, the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, and the North Bennet Street School.
Moree previously ran for a seat on the Cambridge City Council in 2007 and 2009. Both bids were unsuccessful.
He says he got interested in politics because of his uncle, the late Joseph G. Sakey, who was the director of the Cambridge public libraries. Moree described Sakey as “my biggest mentor, tutor, and best friend.”
Although Moree has never held office before, he says his life experiences are exactly what Cambridge needs.
“I made a living on just telling the truth and going to church,” Moree says. “There are so many people lying today. My experience is just telling the truth, being a good citizen, and building buildings. I can go and build a house right now. You know what it would cost you to build a house? It would cost you a lot of money. I know how to build houses.”
“Integrity” is the number one idea that Moree has pushed throughout his campaign. He says he disapproves of the mindset that he sees in the current City Council members.
“They’re professionals,” Moree said. “They lie. They flip-flop. They know how to bang off the issue. We have to go back to integrity in public office. Life is about telling the truth. That’s why we pledge allegiance to the flag, and that’s what we have to stand for.”
In contrast, Moree said that he believes that he has the integrity and intelligence to be the right man for the job.
“I’m smart, and I can see into the future,” said Moree. “I get a lot of information, and I analyze it with great deliberation. I own two pieces of property in Palm Beach. The richest people in the world are my neighbors. These guys can buy Harvard University; they can buy the whole thing.”
Much of Moree’s platform revolves around making sure that Cambridge and Massachusetts citizens have jobs and housing. In addition, Moree is pushing for enhanced bargaining rights for unions and addressing the living wage and prevailing wage.
Moree says he disapproves of the fact that the current city and state governments have not voted on a “residency requirement” for jobs in Cambridge and Massachusetts.
If jobs in the area are required to go to local residents, Moree argues, the resulting increase in income tax revenues would go to the “State department,” thus preventing cuts to programs Moree values such as student aid and programs for the elderly.
“Why should someone from Connecticut or New Hampshire come here to take your job?” Moree says. “You, [a Cambridge resident,] can do it. Why not hire you? Why go to New Hampshire? Because they make backroom deals.”
Moree repeatedly stressed his belief that government dishonesty is to blame for current economic struggles.
“The jobs are leaving [the state of Massachusetts] because people are getting ‘greased,’” Moree says. “There are more jobs leaving the state. When 50 percent of the workers are from out of the state, the state is being bought off.”
Since Cambridge is known for its universities, Moree says he is also concerned about jobs and new college graduates leaving the country.
“We want you to stay here after you graduate,” Moree says. “We don’t want you to go back to whatever country you came from. Other countries are challenging the United States for its high tech jobs. We need to keep high tech jobs here for our people.”
A major pillar of Moree’s campaign has been his plan to hold a regatta on the Charles River with a number of ships, most notably John F. Kennedy’s historic yacht, “The Honey Fitz,” in order to harness the publicity potential for the area.
“I’m inviting the President of the United States here,” Moree says. “Gregg Moree is inviting Barack Obama, Liz Warren, Deval Patrick, Mike Capuano, Stephen Lynch, and Caroline Kennedy on the Honey Fitz Boat. We’re going to have a lunch on the Honey Fitz Boat. The whole world is coming; they’re going to have a million people here.”
Moree has seen his previous campaigns partially derailed by criminal allegations. According to The Cambridge Chronicle, Moree was arrested in 2007 on allegations that he violated a restraining order and assaulted his ex-wife with an umbrella in her home, although the jury found him not guilty. He had previously been charged with breaking and entering and assaulting a police officer in 1974 and 1980, respectively. The latter charges were later dropped.
Most recently, in January 2010, Moree was arrested on allegations of assaulting a woman in his car, also according to The Cambridge Chronicle.
Despite these setbacks, Moree said that he is “a very serious candidate” and is optimistic about his chances.
“As long as you’re honest, and you feel comfortable within your skin, you will prevail,” Moree says. “I may not be everything that everybody wants. No one is. But everyday when we wake up, we try to do it better than the day before.”

At a talk on Jewish humor Wednesday, Visiting Lecturer on Jewish Studies Jordan D. Finkin said the cultural phenomenon of jokes is ingrained in the Jewish identity.
“Jews have no monopoly on jokes, nor on good jokes, yet there is a characterization of Jews as good joke tellers,” Finkin said at the talk in the Lamont Forum Room hosted by the Harvard Library Judaica Division and the Harvard University Center for Jewish Studies.
Finkin spoke about the cultural terrain occupied by jokes and their relationship to the discourse on Jewish identity, peppering his lecture with examples of jokes in Yiddish with English translations.
“Within the Jewish cultural system, humor is Jewish,” he said.
Finkin also talked about the linguistic aspect of Yiddish jokes. He said Yiddish is especially receptive to the Rabbinic tradition of debate, prompting the creation of strictly Jewish cultural jokes based on religious texts such as the Talmud.
He gave examples of popular Jewish joke formats, such as the use of competitive argumentation. “Jewish jokes play on the assumptions of the audience and manipulate those assumptions,” he said. “The joke-teller frustrates those assumptions of the audience.”
Finkin, who is the Cowley Lecturer in Post-Biblical Hebrew at Oxford University, published the book “A Rhetorical Conversation: Jewish Discourse in Modern Yiddish Literature.”
At the lecture, Finkin also spoke on the works of Immanuel Olsvanger and Sholem Aleichem, authors who aimed to present Jewish humor through the Yiddish language. The work of these men exemplify, Finkin said, the point he was trying to make about the nature of jokes. “Jokes can be simple as a common line, or as long as a performance,” he said.
He made a distinction between a Jewish cultural joke and a narrative story. “Stories involve Jewish discourse, but they tend to do so with a formal technique. Jokes also involve Jewish discourse, but as a part of the meaning,” he said. He explained two types of Yiddish jokes: the “Shaggy Dog”—building up to a single punchline—and the “Argument for multiple possibilities.”
Charles Berlin, the head bibliographer in Judaica at the Harvard College Library, introduced Finkin.
“Finkin’s lecture is a fascinating excursion into this area of Jewish culture,” Berlin said.

As the June 2012 start date for the renovation of Old Quincy approaches, administrators announced that they will create physical, life-sized “mock-ups” of a room in renovated Old Quincy.
The models, which will include both a bedroom and a bathroom, will be constructed once the design plans are completed, which will happen “by January or so,” according to Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke.
“We have long planned to build mock ups of rooms to test design concepts as part of the Old Quincy Test Project. We are at the beginning of this process and a number of decisions have not yet been made,” Stephen L. Needham, the Old Quincy project’s program manager, wrote in an email.
The rooms will serve to test design elements and give the Harvard community a chance to see examples of the renovated rooms. The location of the mock-ups is as of yet undetermined.
Over the summer, contractors began testing construction elements in the Old Quincy building in preparation for the ongoing design process happening this fall.
In addition to evaluating the durability of Old Quincy’s preexisting plaster walls and woodwork, contractors installed seven windows in the building in an effort to determine which would work best in the redesigned building.
The renovation of Old Quincy is the first step in Harvard’s ambitious House renewal process that aims to dramatically overhaul the internal structure of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses.
The plans for Old Quincy, announced last May, will remove the walkthrough bedrooms and vertical entryways that are featured in the building’s current setup. While renovations to the interior the building represent a significant renovation, regulations require that the historic building’s exterior remain visually unchanged.
Administrators intend for Old Quincy to serve as a “test project” for future renovations.
Because Quincy contains two buildings—the neo-Georgian Old Quincy and the more modern New Quincy—planners will be able to test their renewal designs while impacting about 180 House residents.
The timeline for the remainder of the House Renewal project has not yet been determined.

Just over 200 students will have the opportunity to see Mark E. Zuckerberg in person at a Facebook recruiting event on Monday.
The Harvard dropout and mastermind behind Facebook returns to his for his first official visit to the College since 2004, when he left to start the social networking site.
Zuckerberg will be accompanied by Mike Schroepfer, Facebook vice president of engineering.
The corporate heads will speak with students in Farkas Hall, the recently renamed New College Theatre, immediately after a press conference in Harvard Yard in the afternoon. He is also scheduled to meet with University President Drew G. Faust.
Zuckerberg will also visit MIT and Carnegie Mellon University on his East Coast recruiting trip.
“He is eager to connect with computer science and engineering students from some of the best schools in the world, and may well be tomorrow’s Facebook innovators,” wrote Andrew Noyes, Facebook’s manager for public policy communications, in an email.
According to its website, Facebook has three internships available in engineering and security, along with 12 open positions for recent graduates from bachelor, master, and doctorate programs.
To apply to attend an exclusive discussion with the executives at 5 p.m., students must upload a resumé to the Crimson Careers portal on the Office of Career Services website by Friday.
The website received eight responses within three seconds of opening the application, said Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities.
Preference will be given to students with applied math, computer science, or engineering backgrounds.
“The plan is for it to be personal and technical alike,” said Computer Science Senior Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, who will moderate the discussion. “In particular, it is meant to appeal to future potential staff.”
Mount said that having students interact with Facebook executives in person replicates the work atmosphere students would enter if hired.
“Facebook is very relaxed and informal,” she said. “They want people who can be in an environment where [Zuckerberg] can see students’ faces and let students ask questions.”
Julia C. Winn ’12, a computer science concentrator who is applying to a few technology companies this fall, said Zuckerberg’s visit significantly increases the appeal of Facebook recruiting.
“He’s a celebrity now,” she said. “That [event is] going to be maxed out—everybody’s going to be there.”
Winn said that her peers who are applying to the technology sector usually target Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. She would like to ask Zuckerberg why these companies are so popular—and why they in turn recruit so heavily at Harvard.
"Rumor has it that software engineers at Facebook have more say over what features they work on and the overall product direction," she said.
Students are not the only ones eagerly anticipating Zuckerberg’s visit. His former professors are also excited for the return of a star pupil.
“I think students will become energized and inspired by the fact that computer science is really a skill—a field of study—that enables people to do amazing things,” said computer science senior lecturer Henry H. Leitner.
“A guy like Bill Gates, or a guy like Mark Zuckerberg, were a bit of anomaly,” Leitner said. Today, Leitner says, in the shadow of Gates and Zuckerberg, creating a startup is a more viable option for undergraduates.
Facebook has been recruiting at Harvard since 2008, according to Mount.

The Harvard Club of Boston, an alumni organization independent from the University, recently came under fire for its behavior during contract discussions with its workers.
On Oct. 3, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against the Club for negotiating “in bad faith” with its service staff—including cooks, cleaners and servers.
The complaint serves as a warning to the Harvard Club, and a failure on their part to amend their bargaining strategies could lead to a national law suit and steep fine, according to Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE! Local 26.
On Wednesday, a student division of the Occupy Boston movement protested in front of the alumni organization’s downtown clubhouse about its poor labor practices.
Lang, president of the union which represents the Harvard Club’s workers as well as Harvard’s dining hall workers, said that the complaint from the National Labor Relations Board and the Occupy demonstration were a result of the Club’s failure to provide basic rights to their workers.
Lang said that the Club and the union had been negotiating their contract since the summer, but the Club’s management refused to negotiate the basic tenets of the contract, including benefits and hourly wages.
According to Lang, the Club’s management proposed no wage increases for six years as well as an expensive health care plan and the elimination of pension plans for new workers.
“They are making proposals that ensure that workers at the Harvard Club will be driven to live a life of poverty,” Lang said.
Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement and one of the student demonstrators in the Occupy movement, said that the negotiations were “appalling.”
“The workers, they’re not trying to be unreasonable. They’re just trying to make enough money to see their families,” said Narefsky, who was present at several of the bargaining sessions between the Club and the union.
Narefsky added that that the negotiations were “embarrassing.”
“It’s not something I want to be associated with the name of Harvard,” she said.
The demonstration by students as part of the Occupy Boston movement hinted at greater class tensions present in the negotiations, according to Lang.
“The membership [of the Harvard Club] is the elite of Boston—the rich, the famous, the powerful,” Lang said. “They go to the Harvard Club to wine and dine and relax and be waited on and taken care of. The folks who do that [service] work are working class new immigrants to this country.”
Students echoed the idea of a class struggle present in the negotiations.
“The Harvard elite are having these fancy meals and wonderful events, and meanwhile the workers are really suffering,” said SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14. “It’s disturbing that this is a club that I could potentially join.”
Narefsky said that even with the added pressure from the National Labor Relations Board, it seems little change has occurred in the Club’s negotiation strategy.
“I had hoped the complaint would make the negotiations go more smoothly,” Narefsky said, “but ... [the Club] continues to bargain aggressively, taking proposals off the table which they have previously offered, and they haven’t stopped offering unacceptable proposals. I think there’s going to have to be a lot of public pressure.”
The Harvard Club of Boston declined to comment.

Two Harvard College alumni were awarded Fulbright scholarships to study in the United Kingdom this year, the U.S.-U.K. Fulbright Commission announced Tuesday.
Trevor J. Bakker ’10 and Kevin X. Liu ’11 joined 37 other scholars from universities in the United States in the exchange program of 168 individuals—the largest group that the program has awarded in 20 years.
Harvard has traditionally performed strongly in the Fulbright program. This year, there are 11 members of the Class of 2011 participating in the program around the world.
Liu, who was a mind, brain, and behavior neurobiology concentrator in Eliot House, entered a doctoral program in physiology, anatomy, and genetics at the University of Oxford.
According the award website, Bakker concentrated in social studies while at Harvard and entered a masters program in economics at University College in London.
“Honestly, I was very surprised and truly very honored to have been given the opportunity,” Liu said in an email to The Crimson. “I found a program at Oxford that would continue my research interests in neurobiology. In particular, I will be working on a project looking at the role of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.”
The U.S.-U.K. Fulbright Programme is a merit-based exchange program that offers scholarships in all fields of study at any university in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Approximately 700 application were nominated by the Center for International Education last winter as part of the six month application process.
The number of students accepted into the program varies from year to year, according to Michael Scott-Kline, the director of the program. The variation of acceptances depended on the national budgets of the United States and the United Kingdom as well as private sponsorships.
The 168 accepted was an increase of 24 percent from last year.
The program’s primary focus is on cultural exchange, Scott-Kline said.
“I was extremely excited to have the chance to come to the UK and learn from the British and other people from around the world on their views of race, class and other topics,” Liu wrote.
“I would highly recommend anyone who is interested to explore postgraduate fellowship opportunities because the process in itself can really help you learn more about yourself,” Liu added.
Natalie Stokes, another Harvard affiliate, was awarded a scholarship to pursue a masters degree in gender, violence and conflict at the University of York. Stokes graduated from Boston College and recently finished a post-baccalaureate premedical program at Harvard.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarifications:
CLARIFICATIONS: November 3, 2011
The Nov. 3 article "Two Harvard Alumni Awarded Fulbright Scholarship" did not make clear the distinction between the United States-United Kingdom Fulbright Commission and the umbrella Fulbright Program. While three Harvard alumni were awarded scholarships through the U.S.-U.K. Fulbright Commission,  the total number of Harvard Fulbright recipients was higher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years after his last collegiate play, Clifton Dawson ’07 is back on the Harvard football field. The all-time Ivy League career rushing leader, Ivy League champion, and former NFL running back has returned to Cambridge for one more piece of hardware—a coveted Harvard Business School intramural flag football championship trophy.
Dawson, who coached the HBS Section G flag football team this fall, is a student in the Harvard Business School working towards an MBA with a general management focus.
“I’m learning a lot about what I’m interested in—working with teams and building teams and focusing on how that passion translates into a career in business,” Dawson said.
Dawson’s return to Cambridge marks the latest stop in an unusual journey that has taken the Ontario, Canada native to Northwestern, Harvard, Toronto, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Houston, and Denver over the past eight years.
Dawson left the NFL in 2010 after playing for the Indianapolis Colts, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Houston Texans. At the end of his career, he applied his unique background to an online management position at a major sporting goods retailer, and in July of 2010, he married his classmate and college sweetheart, Annelise.
The next stop after Harvard Business School is not yet determined.
“I don’t think you’ll find my name in the headlines,” Dawson said when asked where in the news his name will appear next. “Instead, I think you’ll find, hopefully, whatever company I’m working for doing really well.”
Dawson was drawn to HBS because of the similarities he sees between football and the world of business. The team mentality is what attracted Dawson, who also ran track at Harvard, to business in the first place.
“I think … the greatest challenge after playing football is figuring out how I can add value to a new type of team,” Dawson said.
Despite the difficulties, Dawson is well prepared, and he acknowledges that his athletic experience is valuable in a business environment.
“I realize that I bring unique skills to the table based on my experience playing on teams, seeing lots of different forms of leadership, from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Peyton Manning,” Dawson said. “I’ve come to learn a lot from them, [and] that’s translated to lessons about leadership and team dynamics.”
Though Dawson is looking to business in the long-term, he also wants to be involved in football as a coach—but not on a professional level.
“When I left the NFL, I said that I had no interest in being involved in the game,” Dawson said. “But football has represented about 20 years of my life, and when I got here, I realized that there are certain things about the game that I miss and that I am passionate about.”
In the future, Dawson sees himself coaching youth football. But for now, he faces the task of coaching his business school section’s intramural flag football team, an experience that he calls one of the most challenging of his life.
“I realized that I know a lot about the game, having played it for so long,” Dawson said. “But it takes a completely different set of skills to coach, and so this experience really let me try that.”
Dawson’s decision to coach the team is a testament to his desire to learn and gain new experiences. Had he simply wanted to win, of course, he could have just played for the team himself, but he admits that he thought it would be unfair to other teams to have to compete against a professional running back.
And he almost reached the pinnacle of HBS intramural glory in merely his first year. Dawson’s team lost in the championship game, but he is proud of how far his team progressed throughout the season.
According to the team’s quarterback, Patrick Griffin, the team began with very little collective football experience. Throughout the season, Dawson focused on teaching the players the skills of the game—and sharing his love of football.
“None of us are really football players, but we would spend an entire 45 minutes at lunch talking about flag football because we were so pumped up about it,” Griffin said.
For Dawson and his players, the experience was about more than just football. He saw the season as a way to bring his section together, and Griffin said that classmates are following his lead and sharing their personal interests and talents with the group. One person in the section is an art curator, for example, and has been teaching classes on the topic to his classmates.
Dawson, meanwhile, is eager to continue developing his coaching skills.
“I’ll be back next year, if they’ll have me,” he said.
When asked if he would consider crossing the river and coaching intramural flag football at the college, Dawson laughed.
“If there’s a team out there in need of a coach, I’ll be there,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Collegiate soccer is a game that would have made Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel share a knowing smile. The nature of athletic recruiting for college soccer means that teams, players, coaches and game-time strategies must constantly evolve and grow in order to remain competitive.
But this is a competition that the Harvard men’s soccer team has been losing for some time now.
When I took up the Harvard men’s soccer beat, I thought I knew what to expect. I was very cognizant of the fact that this year’s squad—much like the one from last year—was a team under construction, and that this was probably not the team that would allow me to relive the heydays of 2009, my freshman fall, when Andre Akpan and the class of 2009 took the Crimson faithful to the promised land of Ivy League glory.
Any team that loses unique talents such as Mike Fucito ’08, midfielder for the Seattle Sounders, and Akpan '09, forward for the Colorado Rapids, in consecutive years is bound to struggle as it rebuilds.
Instead my expectations were tempered. My hope was that I would somehow witness and chronicle the rebirth of a once dominant and nationally-ranked soccer program, as new talent would replace the old and the team and program would move into contention.
But what I have instead witnessed is not growth, but a failure to evolve with the change in times.
So far in this year’s campaign, the squad hasn’t found much luck on the soccer pitch.
Harvard has only two wins out of 15 games, with its last victory coming in mid-September against a weak UMass squad. Furthermore, the opposition has outscored the Crimson, 22-11.
At this point last year, the Crimson was sitting in the middle of the Ivy League table in fourth place, having captured five points in league play and conceding 15 goals in 15 games. Today, Harvard has actually lost fewer games than at this point in 2010, but the team is drawing matches that it should be winning and conceding almost 50 percent more goals.
Quite simply, these are not statistics worthy of a program that is aspiring to taste Ivy and national glory once again.
While much has already been made of the failings of Harvard’s front line and its inability to find the back of the net, last season and earlier this year, it has been the Crimson backline that has failed the team and its fans this season.
That the Harvard backline surrendered three preventable goals last game against Colgate is an example of the problems that the team has faced. But the problem at hand extends far beyond just one game.
Against Rhode Island, the Crimson defense inexplicably left a man unmarked in the box during a set piece. Working off a long throw-in, a Rams forward was able to fire a header on goal that just arched over a sprawling junior goalkeeper Brett Conrad, costing Harvard the game, 2-1. At Vermont, in a very similar set-up, the Harvard backline left one attacker unmanned in the box, who summarily leapt to head the ball past senior goalkeeper Austin Harms for the 1-0 victory. And at Boston College, the defense would concede two goals and 15 shots in a game that ended 2-0, but could have easily ended as 5-0 loss for the Crimson.
This season, Cornell currently leads the pack with a 3-0-2 record in Ancient Eight play and 8-1-5 overall. At this point last year, the Big Red was winless in Ivy play and not even close to finishing its season above .500.
But what differentiates Cornell’s squad this year from last year is its new found strength on defense. As the season currently stands, Cornell have given up just three goals in Ivy play and nine goals for the season, as opposed the Crimson’s nine goals allowed in Ivy play and 22 overall.
Though a little more verve may have returned to Harvard’s front line given its three-goal performance against Colgate in last Tuesday’s come-from-behind tie, the Crimson will remain seriously vulnerable and weak even if it holds the lead with the defense as it is.
As another promising fall fades away into a fruitless and cold winter, the Crimson are once again faced with fact that it must evolve and grow in terms of its personnel, game play and coaching, or it continue to fall behind its Ivy rivals.
Harvard cannot persist with this system of stagnation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Angela Chang did not arrive at Harvard looking to be a coxswain. Instead, she started out playing lacrosse, a sport in which she earned honors throughout high school. But, looking for a change, she decided to switch to a completely different sport: rowing.
And she does it for the men’s team.
“At the beginning, a couple of my friends [on the team] were the ones who suggested that I should try it out,” Chang explained. “It was kind of terrifying ... But it was a huge thrill being on the water.”
Senior Collin Rees has been with Chang from the start. Racing with her in the 2F and the 3V their freshman and sophomore years, he has seen the evolution of her skills as she refined her talents.
“You could already see many of the things that make her such a great coxswain today,” Rees said. “She really gets to know you, then during a race motivates you individually, rather than just as a boat as a whole.”
So far this year, Chang has had an enormous impact upon the program. At the Princeton Chase last weekend, Chang led her Varsity Eight boat to a win, finishing the three-mile course in 13:15:44. At the Head of the Charles, Chang coxed the runner-up boat for the Crimson.
“We’ve had an exciting start with the fall season,” Chang said. “Head of the Charles was amazing. Going into Princeton Chase, we wanted the double win—that was our goal. We went there and were able to execute, even though it wasn’t the smoothest race.”
Among the lightweight men’s team, Chang is known to be one thing in particular: a competitor. Despite starting crew later in life than other coxswains, Chang worked her way quickly to the top. After walking onto the team her freshman spring, she became the coxswain for the 1V her junior year—an almost unheard of feat.
“Junior year is where everything clasped,” captain Tom Nesel said. “It almost seemed like it came out of left field. She brought a whole lot of aggression and a lot of expertise to the field; she really stepped up her game.”
Despite switching sports, Change said she has been able to maintain the same mentality throughout.
“My mentality as a field player was just playing every inch every second to make my teammates look better,” Chang explained. “Knowing that the guys are giving that much and more, pushing their limits, and doing it for themselves, for each other, and for Harvard rowing, I know that I have to remain 100-percent focused.”
Freshman lightweight coach Linda Muri, who coached Chang during her first semester of crew, cited the importance of her previous athletic training in becoming the successful coxswain that she is today.
“From lacrosse, from being a competitive athlete, she knows that there are times when you are asked to do something that other people might consider to be a sacrifice,” Muri said. “She is what I consider a professional coxswain—she has the right attitude, works hard, wants to know what she can do to make the boat do better, and is in charge when she needs to be.”
Chang is the only female member of the men’s lightweight team, but it has never made a difference to her or to her teammates.
“She’s absolutely just one of the guys,” Rees said. “We don’t even think twice about it. She’s as much of a competitor as any one of us, if not more.”
Her relationship with her teammates has led to the creation of a catch phrase of sorts: let’s get it done. The rest of the boat talked about its importance as a motivational tool, pushing her crew to get better.
Whatever she is doing, it has been successful.
In her first year as coxswain, the team had a perfect dual season, won an Eastern Sprints title, and earned a silver medal at the IRA National Championships.
“‘Get it Done’ is one of her favorite calls to make,” junior Erich Schultze explained. “It’s a reflection of her. A lot of times, we might not feel quite ready for a race, but regardless you have to try to get it done ... Every day she reasserts herself and proves why she is our best coxswain and probably the best coxswain in our league.”
For Chang, it all comes back to the competition and the will to get better and improve the overall team. With one regatta left in the fall and the entire spring season still ahead of her, Chang has countless more times to ‘get it done.’
“I like to win,” Chang concluded. “Right now I can’t physically go out there and do anything, even though I’d like to sometimes when I look over at our opponents. But, I know that the boys are giving their all every second, and it’s my job just to give it right back to them.”

The recently approved Southern Students Association is looking to bring cornbread along with other Southern food, hospitality and traditions to the Harvard Community.
"We really want to bring a southern sense of family and southern sense of community onto the Harvard campus," said Julie L. Coates '14, Southern Students Association president and a Savannah Georgian with an easy smile and an accent to melt your heart. "We want to celebrate a Southern American culture that is not really talked about or celebrated."
Coates said that one of the primary goals of the club is also meant to serve as a support group for Southerner's in the Harvard community.
"I think that Southerners, more than a lot of students, face a culture shock when they come to Harvard," Coates said. "There are lots of little things: slang is different and dating works differently. I know I could've used a group like this when I was a freshman."
Coates said that the club, which is currently made up of about 50% Southern students, is planning events not only to celebrate culture but also to educate the student population.
"A lot of Harvard students are ignorant about southern culture, and we want to help dispel negative stereotypes," Coates said. "We want to show that we are a diverse population."  Towards that aim, Coates said one of the major events under development is a discussion of religion in the Bible Belt.
Yet most of the events currently planned by the board of the SSA are slated to be "purely fun."
"We want people to be excited about our events so we're keeping them as social as possible," Coates said, citing plans for a "Country Cookin' Banquet" and a Southerner of the year award (rumor has it, Paula Dean is the leading candidate).
This week, the association is having their second event of the semester: a gathering for the Alabama-LSU football game accompanied by a Southern breakfast-for-dinner consisting of grits and bacon and biscuits and gravy among other delights. All the cooking will be done by students using their mothers' recipes.
"We're really excited, not just about this event but about the whole year. We really just want everyone to come out and have a good time," Croates said.

Prepare your "Poker Face." Pretty soon, the "Paparazzi" might be coming to Harvard.
Having already made her name as a Grammy Award winner, blockbuster record artist, and sensational dresser, Lady Gaga is adding a new item to her resume: Harvard partner.
The billboard-topping singer announced yesterday that she is launching a foundation focused on mentoring teens and combating bullying, in conjunction with Harvard's Berkman  Center for Internet and Society. In homage to her popular song, the nonprofit will be called the Born This Way Foundation.
John G. Palfrey '94, a co-director of the Berkman  Center, said that the Center is "helping to frame the agenda for the foundation." Since the organization won't launch officially until next year, he said that he couldn't reveal what that agenda would include.
He gave a hint why a Harvard Internet research center would be involved, though. One of the goals of Lady Gaga's foundation, he said, will be "trying to understand the behavior people exhibit online in order to understand why bullying occurs.”
Many branches of Harvard might get to brush up against "The Edge of Glory."
"We're working across school lines," Palfrey said. "It's a good chance for Harvard to be one University."
Palfrey said that Lady Gaga's contribution to the project will extend beyond her star power. "It's very impressive, the amount of research they're doing before this goes underway," he said of Lady Gaga and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta, who will help direct the foundation. "It's unusual, and it's very important."
