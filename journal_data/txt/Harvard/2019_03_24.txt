After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Acts of artistic expression and cultural celebration abounded on March 9 at Sanders Theatre, where the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ 34th Cultural Rhythms Program honored Janet Mock as its 2019 Artist of the Year.
Over the course of the show, 12 student groups delivered unique performances in media ranging from traditional Ethiopian dance to acapella to Tae Kwon Do. In her speech, Mock praised the performers and the ethos of Cultural Rhythms as a whole.
“To write, record, create, sing, dance, seek, and show ourselves in a world intent on erasing and invisibilizing, shunning and shaming, is a necessary and vital act,” she said.
Mock, an award-winning writer and activist, broke ground this year as the first transgender woman of color to write and direct an episode of television for “Pose,” a drama about ball culture in late ‘80s New York City that also included a record-high five transgender women of color in series regular roles.
On Saturday, Mock held court over the proceedings from a chair onstage. She frequently pulled out her phone to capture moments from the performances and posted multiple Boomerangs to her Instagram account throughout the afternoon.
Afterward, student performers emphasized an appreciation for the opportunity that the Cultural Rhythms show affords them to share their cultural art forms with the larger Harvard community.
“Sanders Theatre is the biggest stage at Harvard unless you want to count convocation and commencement,” Ata D. Amponsah ’19, a member of the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, said. “This is the one time that we bring as many people in the Harvard community as possible together to celebrate the diversity in identities.”
“Dance is an art form that allows us to stay true to our roots, to our ethnicity, and display our culture with everybody else,” Mary Galstian ’22, a dancer with the Harvard Armenian Society, said. “I think Cultural Rhythms does a great job allowing different cultures to be on stage as one. It doesn't leave out other cultures and it gives you the opportunity to shine in your own way.”
This year’s theme was “Reclamation,” and the radical act of reclaiming space on Harvard’s campus — both to honor the college’s richness of cultural identities and to empower individuals who have been and continue to be marginalized from rarified, historically exclusionary spaces — recurred as a motif throughout the afternoon. Mock discussed the power and responsibility that comes from occupying these spaces in her address to the audience after formally receiving the Artist of the Year award from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
“As I stand here on this stage as a black and native Hawaiian trans woman,” she said, “I know I am only standing on this stage because of the work of those who put their bodies on the line to fight for self-determination and the elimination of societal forces that impede our collective liberation.”
Khurana’s speech also alluded to the mirror that Cultural Rhythms holds to Harvard’s past. “Like our own nation, there's a great deal that we're proud of,” he said. “But we also have to recognize the complex and contradictory history of our institution — that many of us who are in this room were not have always been part of this community. And so we have to recognize that our aspirations run ahead of our reality.”
Performers and audience members alike also said that they were inspired by Mock’s presence at the festival. “It was truly just breathtaking and awe-inspiring to be in the presence of someone who had been through so much and seeks to be a light for others,” Jenna M. Gray ’19, who acted as one of two emcees for the show, said. “I feel enlightened, as an artist, as a woman of color, as a student, as a storyteller.”
“It’s only March, but so far [Janet Mock coming to Harvard] is the best thing that's happened to me all year,” Omise’eke Tinsley, the F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at the College, said. Tinsley brought her young daughter to the show.
“There’s a lot of excitement in my classes around Janet Mock, and queer students feeling heard and feeling like it's important to have reflected to them that there are queer folk who are doing amazing work and that Harvard recognizes that,” Tinsley said.
The Cultural Rhythms celebration show heralded a month’s worth of programming and campus conversations organized by the Harvard Foundation. The show served as both a conclusion and a reflection.
“I think the dialogue series and conversation series is really important to ground all of this celebration,” said Winona Guo ’22, a Harvard Foundation intern who moderated a more intimate conversation with Janet Mock on Saturday morning. “So I think that although this event was so full of joy and celebration, I think the conversation and the dialogue events that have been happening for a month now are tremendously important to place that celebration in a racial and cultural context, that is filled with both joy and trauma.”
Mock’s speech was the centerpiece of the show, and her words roused the crowd into a standing ovation. She recounted her difficult childhood in Hawaii, where she said, “my library card gave me, this 12-year-old kid, and this lover of books, access to words, written by Maya Angelou and Alice Walker and Zora Neale Hurston.” Now a New York Times bestselling author, Mock herself has the chance to serve as a refuge for other young folks.
“We are worthy of being read, we are worthy of being heard, we are worthy of being seen. we deserve to take up space, on library and bookstore shelves, on syllabi, on gallery and museum walls, on the screen,” she said.
But Mock urged against complacency. “Being the first is cute and all, but the real work comes when we ensure that we hold those doors open so that we're no longer the only or the last, right?” she said.
The audience — now filled with performers who had come from the wings to hear Janet Mock speak — snapped, whistled, and cheered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From March 13 to 17, visitors from Boston and beyond swarmed into the Seaport World Trade Center for this year’s Boston Flower and Garden Show. Themed “The Beauty of Balance,” the event boasted an array of live landscape and floral displays, contests, exhibits, contests, and shops.
Immediately beyond the abundant, multi-colored floral arrangements guarding the venue’s entrance, an entire path of award-winning landscape gardens greeted attendees. Designers used miniature trees, flowing streams, stone pathways, tea tables, and oak gazebos to put together life-sized displays. In response to this year’s theme of “The Beauty of Balance,” landscape design company Samantha’s Gardens created a display complete with a candle-adorned meditation hunt.
“We attempt to capture the calm, soothing tranquility of a natural forest scene with a meditative state that draws individuals to immerse themselves in the beauty of nature in hopes of bringing balance back into their lives,” the company wrote in the landscape’s description.
Samantha Mannarino, owner of Samantha’s Gardens and fifth-year participant of the Boston Flower and Garden Show, said she was especially fond of this year’s theme.
“It’s something that we strive for everyday,” she said. “Both my design partner and myself walk the woods everyday and just stay in touch with mother nature. ‘Beauty of Balance’ was the perfect theme for our philosophy of life.”
Mannarino and her partner, Vlasta Benedict, started working on their exhibit over six months prior to the show. “Vlasta and I knew what we wanted to do last year. We really kind of get down and dirty in between fall and Christmas and then it all takes off from there,” Mannarino said.
Small boutiques, food vendors, and galleries flanked either side of the trail of live displays. Some of these booths offered historical information: Plymouth 400’s “‘Our’ Story: 400 Years of Wampanoag History,” for example, chronicled the capture and enslavement of 27 Wampanoag men near modern-day Plymouth and Cape Cod.
“This tragic and compelling backstory to the colonization of Plymouth has been long overlooked and comes to life in the exhibit’s dramatic images and video impact statements,” the exhibit’s panel read.
Other exhibits included an art gallery from the New England Society of Botanical Artists, a shop selling Handmade Garden Mushrooms, a table of carnivorous plants, and an Ask the Experts Pavilion.
Each day of the event also offered an assortment of different workshops, lectures, and demonstrations. With over sixty time slots across all five days, professors and other gardening experts shared their advice on everything from “Hip, Hip Hydrangea – Complete Primer for Identifying, Planting, Pruning and Maintenance” during the week to “Growing Cannabis Made Easy: A Quick Guide to a Legal, Personal, Cannabis Home Garden in MA” on the weekends. During the show’s peak hours, the lecture hall was at full capacity.
Attendees Maureen and Rachel McNeil attribute the Boston Flower and Garden Show’s popularity to people’s anticipation for spring. “You go through a winter where you’re inside most of the time, and when you finally feel like spring is coming, you just want to get out and start getting ideas for your own landscape,” Maureen McNeil said.
Mary and Allan Pfeiffer, a couple from Melrose, Mass., have been coming to the show annually for over 35 years as a “tradition to welcome the spring.” Over the years, Mary Pfeiffer says believes the show has become more commercialized. “There were more live displays and less shopping areas,” she said.
Nonetheless, Mary Pfeiffer still holds great admiration and respect for the show. “It isn’t just a bunch of flowers,” she said. “These are people that are very passionate about not just gardening but sculptures and how to put them together to make beautiful scenes that have meaning and can reach people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sunday night will mark a week from Harvard men’s basketball’s disappointing loss in the Ivy League Championship against Yale.
Yet, while the Bulldogs’ season has since concluded after a first-round loss against LSU in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson’s 2018-2019 campaign lives on as Harvard will travel to North Carolina for the second time this season. The Crimson will take on NC State in a sold-out Reynolds Coliseum, four days after knocking off the Georgetown Hoyas in the first round of the NIT. The contest will tip off at 7:30 PM, and will be nationally televised on ESPNU.
If Harvard could win yet again on the road, over the 11-point favorite Wolfpack, the Crimson would advance to within a game of the semifinal round, which will be hosted at New York’s Madison Square Garden. In order to do so, however, will require another strong effort from Harvard in a hostile environment.
The Crimson remained unflinching despite a raucous crowd of Georgetown faithful at McDonough Arena on Wednesday night, as the Hoyas’ supporters came in droves to see the first Georgetown game in several years played on campus. A late Hoyas’ run left Harvard with its backs against the wall, fighting for its season and the careers of its six seniors, but the Crimson were able to find a late surge to hold on for a three-point victory in Washington, D.C.
Knocking off NC State — another basketball blue blood— will be no small feat for the Crimson. The Wolfpack, who narrowly missed out on an at-large bid to the Big Dance, are lead by a trio of high-percentage shooting guards. Torin Dorn, Markell Johnson, and C.J. Bryce helm NC State’s offense, all of whom average double-digit scoring per game, and shoot the ball at over a 45 percent clip from the field.
Dorn, a redshirt senior, leads the team in scoring and rebounding, at 13.5 and 7.1 per game, respectively. The Charlotte, NC., native had an impressive outing in the first round of the NIT against Hofstra, scoring 19 points and chipping in nine rebounds in a come from behind victory at Reynolds.
NC State also boasts an impressive frontcourt, helmed by forward DJ Funderbunk. The sophomore will be an apt match for Harvard’s Chris Lewis, as both tower above the court at 6’10 and 6’9, and the duo also share the No. 0 jersey. Funderbunk, a native of Cleveland, OH., has averaged just over 20 minutes per game, scoring 8.9 points per game on an efficient 55 percent field goal mark.
Up against an evenly sized opponent, Lewis will be relied upon in Raleigh, both offensively and defensively. The junior forward had a solid game against the Hoyas, going up against talented big man Jesse Govan. The Alpharetta, Ga., native scored 10 points for the Crimson, chipping in six rebounds in 21 minutes of play, a welcome performance after Lewis’ two-point disappointment against Yale in the Ancient Eight finals.
Ultimately, it’s hard to believe Harvard’s success won’t live and die by the performance of junior guard Bryce Aiken. A game after scoring 38 points against Yale, Aiken’s late scoring, knocking in the Crimson’s final six points, lifted the visitors over Georgetown.
The Randolph, N.J., native, despite scoring a modest 17 points, asserted control in the first round when Harvard needed it most, and will be relied upon similarly on Sunday night. Now averaging over 22 points per game, Aiken’s 86 percent clip from the free-throw stripe has become an integral part of the Crimson’s success, never more apparent than on Wednesday, when he drilled 4-of-4 free throws in the final minute to knock off the Hoyas.
Aiken will certainly be a focus of NC State’s Head Coach, Kevin Keatts. Keatts, who is in his second season at the helm of the Wolfpack program, has not missed an NCAA Tournament since the 2014-2015 season. Keatts led UNCW to two Tournament appearances, and NC State to the Big Dance in his first season last year, but will look to keep his team focused on advancing to within a game of Madison Square Garden.
A sold-out Reynolds Coliseum and home court advantage make the Wolfpack the clear favorites on Sunday night. That being said, Harvard Coach Tommy Amaker will certainly have his team prepared, after a gutsy victory over Georgetown, arguably the team’s most impressive win of the season. Instead of hanging their heads at losing for a second straight season in the Ivy Championship, the Crimson seem poised to continue to compete in the NIT, looking to upset a team on the road for the second time this week, and advance to within a game of playing at MSG, dubbed the World’s Most Famous Arena.
