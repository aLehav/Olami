After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson published a troubling account of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus. The report documented that, despite resources available to sexual assault survivors like the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Administrative Board charged with discipline of the perpetrators remains committed to cryptic proceedings and vague standards of evidence that seem to benefit offenders over survivors.
The current unclear standard of evidence mandates that members of the Ad Board must be “sufficiently persuaded” of the occurrence of a sexual assault in order to take administrative action, rather than the “preponderance of the evidence” standard urged by the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education and already employed at all other Ivy League universities except Princeton.
We strongly encourage Harvard to adopt the preponderance of the evidence standard while revising its policies on sexual assault in the wake of the Undergraduate Council referendum that received 85 percent of the vote in favor of a reexamination of University sexual violence policies. A sluggish adoption of this standard leaves the University open to a Title IX suit similar to the lawsuit filed at Yale that prodded the institution to update its standard of evidence last year.
Diane L. Rosenfeld, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, notes that, “The preponderance of the evidence standard is the correct standard in discrimination cases. Just because it’s sex discrimination should not make it a higher standard…in the educational setting, the school is responsible for protecting the civil rights of the students.”
Harvard would also do well to adopt a standard of affirmative consent, where clear verbal or physical consent must be sought before sexual activity. Such a standard would place impetus on initiators of sexual activity to obtain consent rather than on victims to express non-consent. Harvard’s official adoption of affirmative consent, already employed at colleges including the University of Iowa and Antioch College, would encourage other colleges and universities to do the same.
In 2010 alone, 36 Harvard students reported sexual assault to the Harvard University Police Department, but in the entire five-year period from 2005 to 2010, only eight cases of sexual misconduct were ever brought before the Ad Board. Of the eight cases, three resulted in students required to withdraw for at least one semester, and remarkably, no student was expelled. If there is any crime deserving of permanent expulsion from the University, it is rape proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but the Ad Board’s record from 2005 to 2010 suggests an undue priority given to the interests of sexual assailants. Moreover, false reports of sexual assault are statistically extremely rare, giving the Ad Board all the more reason to exercise due diligence in adjudicating students accused of assault.
Seeing their assailants on campus, survivors of sexual assault report dismay at these perceived lack of consequences delivered by the Ad Board to perpetrators. An overhaul is needed to remedy the clumsiness and lack of transparency in the Ad Board’s proceedings. Moving from a needlessly vague “sufficiently persuaded” barometer to the less capricious and more definite preponderance of evidence standard is an important step, as is the use of clearer policies and more severe punishments.
Harvard simply owes its students better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The papal conclave started yesterday, and many progressives—both inside and outside the Church—are praying that an African be elected.
Though their main candidate, Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, is likely to be passed over in favor of a Westerner, the wishes of the liberal bloc are reasonable, at least in a basic sense. For every U.S. resident that joins the Church, four leave; European Catholics are fleeing even faster, and growth in Latin America is anemic. Africa is the only continent where Catholicism is expanding as a proportion of the population, and it is doing so exponentially. Assuming that the Church’s leadership should reflect the changing demographics of its laypeople, the election of an African seems fair.
What’s more, one shouldn’t underestimate the symbolism of an African pope.  Coming off the stodgy, conservative—some would say reactionary—tenure of Benedict XVI, the first-ever ascension of a Sub-Saharan to the papacy would be bold riposte to those that accuse the Vatican of Eurocentrism.
Just this mere possibility, that a non-white, non-European might be the new Bishop of Rome, has stirred progressive Catholics the world over, be they columnists or demonstrators outside the Holy See.
I wish I could be so excited. I wish I honestly believed that this transition might be a substantively positive development for African Catholics. But the fact of the matter is that the election of an African will do nothing to change the Vatican’s reactionary stances on contraception and homosexuality—stances that lead to the death and estrangement of hundreds of thousands of Sub-Saharans every year.
The horror of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is well known, so I won’t spend too much time describing the details.  Suffice it to say that well more than a million Africans die annually of AIDS, and 23 million are currently living with HIV.  As a result, the average life expectancies in several nations in the region have been shortened by more than a third over the past two decades.
Unsurprisingly, the use of condoms is a proven method of combating the disease: The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization have all found a robust correlation between condom use and lowered rates of infection. One can of course argue that other methods of fighting HIV, such as sexual fidelity, are more effective. But few would argue that condoms serve no purpose in this fight at all.
Benedict XVI, however, has established himself as one of those irrational few, proclaiming during a 2009 visit to Cameroon that the “distribution of condoms…increases the problem.” He would later moderate his stance, claiming in 2010 that the use of a condom could be justified in exceptional circumstances, for example, for “male prostitutes,” but he never backed away from his rejection of condoms as a mainstream means of combating HIV.
The Catholic population of Africa has taken the Vatican’s words seriously, and many aid workers attempting to promote condom use have expressed frustration with the Church.  One would hope that an African clergyman, to whom the horrors of AIDS are more immediate, would be less doctrinaire in matters of contraception.  Peter Turkson of Ghana, however, is not. During a 2009 speech at the Vatican, he concurred with Benedict XVI’s remarks in Cameroon, implying that condoms worsen the problem rather than alleviate it.
In addition to Turkson’s mistrust of contraception, it’s worth mentioning his anachronistic views of homosexuals. Turkson has defended Uganda’s so-called “Kill the Gays” law , a proposed piece of legislation to criminalize homosexuality up to a capital offense, and attacked UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon for his denunciation of homophobic legislation, saying in reference to gays that there exists a “distinction between morality and human rights.”
To be fair, Turkson’s statements do not reflect Church doctrine: The Vatican explicitly opposes violence as a punishment for homosexuality.  But even the Church’s outdated doctrinal characterization of gays and lesbians as “disordered” and oriented “toward an intrinsic moral evil” lends a certain legitimacy to those that openly vilify homosexuality, whether they be legislators or their constituents.
I don’t mean to argue that an African pope would be bad for Africa per se.  Whomever the College of Cardinals elects will likely be a conservative, so his origins hardly matter from a policy standpoint. Nor do I mean to condemn the Catholic Church as a vessel of unconditional evil in Africa: On the contrary, the Church provides shelter and comfort for many in the war-torn, impoverished stretches of the Sub-Saharan bush.
But I do mean to point out a simple truth: No matter where the next pope comes from, the Church will still be complicit in the death and mistreatment of hundreds of thousands of AIDS victims and homosexuals throughout Africa. We can continue to argue over the best skin color or national origin of the next pontificate.  But compared to the effects of the policies he’ll be promoting, this debate seems awfully trivial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a student group called Responsible Investment at Harvard criticized the Harvard Management Company for investing in an index fund that partially invests in gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. The organization has chosen its name rather unwisely, because their criticism shows an ignorance of how investments work and a lack of responsibility.
First, the group was factually incorrect to call for Harvard to “sever financial ties” with gun manufacturers because Harvard has no financial ties to gun manufacturers. The morally dubious fund in question is iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund, an index fund that tracks the performance of 2,000 small-cap American companies indiscriminately. According to the prospectus of the exchange-trade fund, HMC is not a stakeholder of Smith & Wesson until it chooses to redeem its share in the ETF, a process that HMC is not qualified to do. The most that the group can claim is that Harvard’s endowment “gains exposure to Smith & Wesson’s price movement.” Also, even if Harvard owns stock in a company, it does not mean that Harvard’s money is supporting the company’s operations. Since Smith & Wesson is unlikely to raise capital in the future, both the ownership of the stock and price of the stock are irrelevant to the company’s daily operation. Claiming that Harvard’s money will “support the manufacture and production of assault weapons” is vast hyperbole and shows the group’s lack of understanding of the investment process.
The group’s call also lacks a sense of responsibility toward the University. Assuming that exposing Harvard’s endowment to gun manufacturer stock price movement is “symbolic of support for the industry,” one must wonder the extent of Harvard’s mortal sin. Since Harvard has about $2.8 million invested in the ETF fund and the fund allocates 0.5 percent of its investment in Smith & Wesson, Harvard’s exposure to Smith & Wesson is only $14,000. Divesting from the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, however, will be costly, because small-cap stocks generally perform better than the broader market.
Admittedly, there are socially responsible alternatives to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, but all such alternatives consistently report dismal returns. All 14 small-cap funds in the SocialFund database performed worse than iShares Russell 2000 ETF since their inception, and five of the 14 are among the bottom 15 percent of all small-cap funds. Even if these funds do as well as iShares Russell 2000 in the future, their expense ratios are at least one percent higher than that of iShares Russell 2000. HMC will pay $30,000 more every year to manage the same small-cap exposure, equivalent to a one percent salary increase for 60 Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers staff earning average salary.
Gun manufacturers are just one kind of investment targeted by Responsible Investment at Harvard, yet I am already concerned with their methodology for choosing divestment targets. Among the many externalities and injustices stemming from capitalism, the group has focused on a politically controversial issue with a convoluted connection to a small part of Harvard’s endowment. Perhaps the group’s goal is not to maximize Harvard’s endowment, but to promote a particular political stance in a controversial national debate (disclosure: I have no position on gun control). Even if we strongly agree with the politics, we should be skeptical about the practical gains of expressing these beliefs with respect to Harvard’s endowment. We must recognize that, contrary to what was suggested on the Undergraduate Council referenda last semester, it is unlikely that divestment will “avert environmental crisis” or invest “for positive social impact.” It would merely allow us to feel good about ourselves.
Although I have no objection to taking pride in the University’s investment practices, I believe the divestment movement needs to make a much stronger case for its recommendations. First, the movement must establish how Harvard’s investment in an industry can cause harm to society, not just why the industry itself is harmful. Second, the group needs to decide whether the social benefit from divestment is justified by its impact on Harvard’s ability to conduct academics and support staff, perhaps with help from the Vice President of Sustainable Investing. Before the divestment movement investigates such costs and benefits in a rigorous way, it is no more than a feel-good campaign relying on popular sentiments.
Jonathan Z. Zhou ’14 is an applied mathematics concentrator in Eliot House. His column appears on alternate Wednesdays.
Correction: March 26
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Harvard’s indirect investment in Smith & Wesson as $1,400. In fact, the figure is $14,000.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Class of 2016,
Let’s look back over your past few months.
Your freshman year at Harvard University is nearing its end. You have already gotten your first taste of Expos. You’ve attended the sixth-straight drubbing of that school from New Haven on a brisk November afternoon. You may have even witnessed a Yard full of naked strangers and friends on a primal winter night before finals. Perhaps you were among them. Good for you.
While you will forever savor these first experiences, we write in the spirit of looking forward.
The memories of Housing Day morning can only be contained in blasts of experience. You’ll wake to discordant chants around the John Harvard statue. You’ll watch triumphant Houses taking laps around the Yard. You’ll feel the excitement in the cheers of the hundreds of upperclassmen storming your entryways. While all of that happens, you and your friends will be huddled in your dorm, waiting restlessly for the letter that announces your home for the next three years.
If the preceding paragraph made you excited, anxious, or some combination of the two, you need not fret. These sentiments are a natural reaction to what will become the most memorable day of your freshman year. However, if you think that you will lose friends via “outsourcing to the quad” or will wake to the nibbling chatter of rats down by the river, your worries have no basis in reality. If you dread being placed in a House near the bottom of some “objective” ranking system, your fears are unfounded. There is no need to be afraid of your own personal outcome on Housing Day. We write to tell you that the tears that run down your excitement-flushed cheeks Thursday morning should be ones of joy, not sorrow. No matter which House beckons at your door in a few days, realize that what awaits you in the coming years is a community full of supportive peers, a plethora of new facilities, as well as a host of tutors, House masters, and staff that you will swear to be the “absolute best on campus” in just a few weeks’ time.
Each House offers so many routes to happiness. You could be spending your Sunday nights by the fire in Adams enjoying hot cider and warm cookies in the Master Palfreys’ House or laughing over hot drinks with friends in Cabot Café after a day of soaking in the sun on the Quad lawn. You could be chowing down with friends from every House in Quincy courtyard, since the dining hall doesn’t have interhouse restrictions. You could be enjoying the scrumptious treats at Lowell tea while mingling with friends, peers, and distinguished guests. You could be reveling in Winthrop’s three great courtyards and strong intramural program that has helped to build one of the closest House communities at Harvard. You could refine your dance moves while attending Eliot’s three legendary formals, all enclosed in the comforts of a beautiful courtyard overlooking the Charles. You might be in Leverett House, the largest House community on campus, in which you are not expected to excel in a narrow field, but rather encouraged to explore and discover—indeed, a community for everyone! You might be in Dunster, where you will grow to love long nights spent in the majestic dining hall with friends and midnight cookies from the House masters. Or next door in Mather, where you could be enjoying a meal with a luxurious view of the Charles through the floor-to-ceiling dining hall windows before heading back upstairs to your single. If you love knowing everyone in your community, you will love Kirkland and Secret Santa, the largest and most epic week-long gift-giving extravaganza. You could bask in your enormous suite or single in Pfoho or satisfy your most intense gustatory desires with Currier’s unparalleled cheffing. As you can see, there is an incredibly rich diversity of experiences at all of our Houses, and we challenge you to seek them out.
We are ecstatic to meet you on Thursday morning. While we may greet you in outfits ranging from suits and boxers to speedos, we’ll all be bursting with spirit and reveling in House pride. We hope that you will be just as excited to meet us, too.
Your experience here is what you make of it. Wherever you end up this Housing Day, you will have the means to make your next few years extraordinary. We invite you to seize the opportunity and confidently endeavor upon the future chapters of your Harvard experience with love for the House that you will call your own.
With much anticipation, infinite excitement, and even more love,
Your House Committee Chairs
Brett Roche ’15, a Slavic languages and literatures concentrator in Currier House, is co-chair of the Currier House Committee. Ginny C. Fahs ’14, a Crimson magazine executive and history and literature concentrator in Quincy House, is co-chair of the Quincy House Committee. Kathryn G. Walsh '14, a social studies concentrator in Adams House, is co-chair of the Adams House Committee. This piece is a collaboration between the House Committee co-chairs of the 12 undergraduate Houses who sit on the House Committee Council. Each of the 12 Houses participated in the piece's creation and formation.

Sociology 43: “Social Interaction” is a course that examines social activities and group dynamics­. Yet when students across campus come together this Thursday for one of the College’s biggest days for House spirit—Housing Day—students in the course will be getting ready to take a midterm exam at 11:30 a.m.
“There is a bit of irony here,” said sociology lecturer Timothy Nelson.
As midterm season reaches its peak, several courses will hold exams on Housing Day, challenging students to find a balance between academics and the day’s festivities.
Nadia P. Armouti ’15 has a test scheduled for Arabic Bb: “Intermediate Arabic II” at noon on Thursday. She said she plans to study in advance so that she can participate in the festivities and knock on freshman doors for Currier House.
Several members of the faculty said that holding midterms the week before spring break makes the most sense, regardless of whether or not it coincides with Housing Day.
Nelson said he understands that giving a midterm on Housing Day can create a conflict for students between their social and academic activities. He said he would rather give the exam before spring break, though, so that students do not need to think about an upcoming test over break.
“In one sense, I’m doing this on behalf of the students,” Nelson said.
He also questioned why Housing Day is scheduled for the week before spring break—a popular week for faculty to schedule exams.
“It’s regrettable that Housing Day comes right before spring break when there are a lot of exams scheduled,” Nelson said. “It does put the students in kind of a difficult position of having this really intense, important day...at the same time that they have to worry about midterms and so on.”
Nelson also noted that, when he was making the schedule for the course, he did not realize that the exam would fall on Housing Day.
Economics professor David I. Laibson also told The Crimson in an email that he and economics professor Philippe Aghion forgot about Housing Day when scheduling the midterm for Economics 1011b: “Macroeconomic Theory” on Thursday.
“The social life and social calendar of the students is not really apparent to faculty,” Nelson said.
Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich also emphasized that students keep academics their priority.
"We certainly understand the excitement that comes with Housing Day and that it can be play an important role in terms of building House community. However, as with all social activities, it is important for students to remember that academics must be the priority," Friedrich wrote in an email to the Crimson.
Psychology professor Steven Pinker, whose course Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science” has a midterm exam on Thursday, told The Crimson in an email that academics should be the priority when such social and academic conflicts exist.
“There are countless extracurricular events and activities that could eat away at academic commitments, but academic coursework is the raison d’etre of a university, and has to come first,” Pinker wrote.

Former President of Mexico Felipe de Jesús Calderón Hinojosa spoke at Kirkland Common Room Tuesday, challenging critics of his crackdown on drugs and organized crime in Mexico and suggesting ways gun control and immigration reform in the U.S. could benefit both nations.
After sending thousands of Mexican army soldiers to put down drug violence in 2006, Calderón’s fight against the cartels quickly became known as the “war on the drugs”—a term he vehemently disputed Tuesday.
“It is not a war on drugs from my side,” Calderón said, adding that the term—which dates back to President Richard Nixon’s time—does not justly define the purpose of his work.
“Yes, the drugs and crime are very correlated, but they are not the same thing,” Calderón said, adding that his goal was to defend and protect Mexican families.
“Drugs itself is a different issue,” said Calderón, who legalized the individual possession of drugs in Mexico four years ago.
“The key point to win this effort is to stop the money that the criminals receive from the American consumers,” Calderón said.
When asked about the correlation between the gun trade and violence, Calderón called for more comprehensive oversight of gun ownership.
Citing the expiration of the Assault Weapons Ban in late 2004, Calderón noted the strong correlation between unlimited access to weapons and the homicide rate in Mexico.
Over 80 percent of the guns used in these crimes were sold in American gun shops, Calderón said.
“I really respect and admire the American Constitution and the Second Amendment,” Calderón said. “However, it is very different to be able to buy 100, 200 weapons and deliver them to criminals.”
Calling for the creation of a “collective register of weapons,” Calderón said tracking weapons sold and their owners’ information would be a step in the right direction towards regulation.
Calderón also spoke extensively about immigration between the U.S. and Mexico.
“It’s not good news for Mexico,” Calderón said about the estimated 6.8 million undocumented Mexican immigrants already living in the U.S.
To preserve the rights of those already in the U.S., Calderón proposed a potential fee-based system where Mexicans could pay taxes or a participate in a transitory work program.

Workers from the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers stood in front of Mass. Hall one last time Tuesday to celebrate the conclusion of the union’s longest ever negotiations with the University.
During the past six weeks, HUCTW organized standouts every Tuesday and Thursday to bring attention to the ongoing negotiations.
While HUCTW’s old contract expired July 1 of last year, both sides had been stalled in negotiations about the details of the new contract until Monday, when a new tentative contract was announced. HUCTW members are slated to vote to ratify the deal on April 2.
This last event concluded the stand out tradition on a celebratory note.  Signs with messages like “We Can’t Eat Prestige” were replaced by ones reading “Yay!!” and “FINALLY!”
“It’s been such a hard road to get to where we are,” HUCTW Vice President Laura Ebenstein said. “We feel good about it and we want to, in some way, make a hard situation end in a happy place.”
Participants said they came to the standout to thank the students and everyone else who has supported them over the course of the negotiations. Some said that while they wouldn’t miss the cold weather, they would miss the opportunity to come together and talk to members of the community.
“I’ve met some nice people out here that I wouldn’t have met otherwise, and even though sometimes it was cold, there was always this feeling of camaraderie,” said Susan M. Kinsella, an administrative coordinator in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department.
All union members interviewed for the article said that they were very satisfied with the results of the negotiation.
“I wish it hadn’t taken so long, but I think it was a good and reasonable solution,” said Ceallaigh E. Reddy, a program administrator for the Harvard Law School Islamic Legal Studies Program. “I know the university has its considerations, and obviously the union members want to have a fair contract, and I think this ended up ultimately being reasonable for both sides.”

UPDATED: March 13, 2013, at 2:20 a.m.
Members of the Class of 2016 will be barred from the College’s 12 upperclassmen Houses on Wednesday night, as administrators attempt to prevent the prohibited tradition of River Run, which takes place the day before freshmen are assigned to one of the Houses.
"While we certainly understand your excitement about your House assignment, given the Houses’ own plans and activities, the Houses are not open to you on Housing Day Eve," Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 wrote in an email to the class of 2016.
Given the dangerous activities associated with the tradition, including heavy alcohol consumption and the launching of burning boats onto the Charles River, administrators said that they are concerned about the safety of students.
During River Run, freshmen travel among the Houses, drinking alcohol in the process and hoping to “influence” the random assignment that they will receive the next day.
Blocking groups also set fire to small, homemade boats on which they write the names of their most, or least, preferred Houses.
“Some of the traditions that people refer to aren’t really traditions," Dingman said. “River Run doesn’t go back so long in time, and it has had elements of risk that I think are very serious.”
To prevent the underage drinking that typically accompanies River Run, Dingman informed freshmen that there will be increased monitoring from security guards, the Harvard University Police Department, the Cambridge Police Department, and Massachusetts State Police.
Following a class-wide event hosted by the First Year Social Committee in Annenberg, the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub will offer freshmen free snacks as a safer alternative to the River Run tradition.
Administrators said, however, that some freshmen will inevitably decide to drink on Wednesday.
“Obviously some people during these momentous occasions will choose to make decisions we wish they wouldn’t make,” Director for Freshman Programming Katie W. Steele said.
In an email to the Class of 2016, Dingman sent a stern warning.
“Should you choose to drink on Housing Day Eve, be prepared to accept consequences related to your actions,” Dingman wrote.
The College’s amnesty policy will remain in effect on Wednesday night, he added.
Upperclassmen said they think the administration should allow the River Run to continue.
“It’s a tradition. Despite the administration’s negative attitude, [River Run] is not bad,” Joshua R. Garcia ’13 said. “Freshmen don’t have to drink.”
Others said they fail to see how Wednesday night’s festivities differ from those on a typical weekend evening.
“I think the freshmen who get in trouble medically might get in trouble on regular weekends [too],” Will H. Chambers ’14 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony this past May, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith stood in front of Old Quincy and declared, “The House system is the institution at the very heart of the Harvard experience.”
Smith’s words echo a common refrain at Harvard. Unlike at many of its peer institutions, at Harvard, undergraduates are expected to live on campus for all four years of their college experience.
In this environment, Harvard has prioritized projects to improve House life—pouring more than $1 billion into its ambitious plan to renew its 12 undergraduate Houses, and launching several social space initiatives at the House level.
But despite these efforts, every year, a few students cannot be enticed to stay in the Houses.
According to Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, about 120 sophomores, juniors, and seniors chose to live off-campus in non-University housing this academic year. An additional 32 undergraduates chose to live in the Dudley Co-operative Society, which offers alternative housing for College students.
This week Harvard’s Houses prepare to welcome freshmen into their communities, but those who no longer live on campus say that, for them, the Housing Day hype is overblown. Students interviewed for this article who no longer live in Harvard housing say they are not so much drawn to the perks of off-campus life than turned off by a residential system in which they did not feel at home.
SEEKING A SPACE OF THEIR OWN
This past fall, Martin S. Molina Hernandez ’15 lived in a cramped two-room suite in Leverett with three other roommates. He often found it difficult to concentrate when he was living with his friends in the dorm, finding himself caught up in late night conversations and frequently getting distracted.
By the end of the semester, he realized he needed a change.
“I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I feel like I need [my own room],” he said. “You could always get a single at Sigma Chi, so I chose to live there.”
Hernandez, who is a member of Sigma Chi, now lives at the fraternity’s house on Mass. Ave. Hernandez said he enjoys having a place to himself that he can decorate and make into his own environment, which he felt he could not do in the dorms.
“You have the freedom to do whatever you want with your living environment,” he said. “I’m originally from Venezuela and my grandmother got me a hammock from there, so I drilled it into my wall by myself.”
Hernandez is not alone in feeling that Harvard housing does not always allow for enough personal space. Ellie M. Reilly ’13, a former Pforzheimer House resident, said that students’ disregard for their neighbors made it difficult for her to study on the weekends.
“There were people once yelling at 3 a.m. at Pfoho—blasting music and having a party until early in the morning,” said Reilly, who now lives in Somerville with three other roommates.
Reflecting on that memory, Reilly said she is “so glad” she lives off-campus.Reilly said that another perk of living off-campus is getting to cook for herself and live independently.
“I can have weird sleep schedules, but then it’ll happen that I wake up at 9 p.m. at night and the dining hall would be closed,” Reilly said. “It’s really nice to have food in my pantry and to be able to cook whenever I want.”
Like other undergraduates who live off-campus, Reilly said she can enjoy the social scene at Harvard but is also able to leave it behind and return to her own, quiet place, which she said she could not find in a dorm room.
“At home, I can just have silence and do my work.” Reilly said. “If I want that sense of community, I’ll go to Harvard.”
LOOKING FOR AN INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE
Sahil A. Khatod ’14, who moved from Pfoho to the Dudley Co-op, said that he disliked the culture of dependence fostered by the Houses and their administrators.
“I didn’t like the fact that people did everything for you,” he said. “I wanted to go somewhere that was really community-based, where people needed each other, there was no social hierarchy, and people were very friendly to each other.”
Khatod is one of several students who said they moved off campus because they disliked the feeling of being coddled and controlled by the Harvard House system.
At the Co-op where Khatod now lives, students cook and clean for themselves in accordance with a system that requires residents to complete a certain number of chores each week. This arrangement, he said, creates a strong sense of community among its residents.
Especially with Harvard cracking down on alcohol through new policies like banning high-risk drinking games and setting guidelines for private student parties, some students who live off campus said the prospect of escaping the administrators and policies that govern the Houses served as a further draw.
Hernandez disliked the requirements that he shut down parties after Harvard’s 2 a.m. deadline and officially register gatherings with large groups of friends. He said he thinks the sense of community in the Sigma Chi fraternity house is stronger in part because of the absence of resident deans and tutors and the constant supervision they provide.
“It can be a bureaucratic process to simply have a few people hanging out in your room,” said Hernandez. “Here, I can do that whenever I want to without worrying.”
For Hernandez, living outside of the Harvard House system provides “a sense of freedom and autonomy” even while he is able to remain connected with the College community through his friends.
“I definitely wanted to experience a lifestyle that’s more similar to the ‘real’ world where I have to fend for myself rather than being in a glorified boarding school,” he said. “I love Harvard but I just grew out of it.”
Khatod said that even in the Co-op, where residents must adhere to some of the same policies as students who live in the Houses, he feels the impact of supervision from resident deans and tutors to a far lower degree than he did on-campus.
The Co-op, like the Houses, has its own resident tutors, but Khatod said he does not “feel they interfere much” with him.
“I don’t feel they’re in positions of authority, but that they’re part of the community,” he said.
 REACTING TO EXPENSIVE PRICE
For some students, the price of Harvard housing, which for the 2012-2013 academic year was $8,366 for room rental alone, is motivation enough to search for cheaper alternative housing options.
The price tag of a Harvard dining plan, which cost $5,264 this past year, can serve as a further monetary deterrent.
According to the Student Handbook, Harvard’s Financial Aid Office assumes that students who choose to live off-campus have “the same room, board, and personal expenses as students living on campus.”
Students on financial aid still receive monetary support for room board even if they choose not to live in College housing.
Khatod said that the difference in room and board rates made living in the Dudley Co-op cheaper for him than living in a Harvard House. Meals at the Co-op, not including lunch, cost $185 per semester.
As a result of living off-campus, Khatod estimated that he saves “around $6,000 a semester total.”
Students who do not pay the full cost of board are able to purchase dining plans of 5, 10, or 21 meals in Harvard’s dining halls, but many choose to eat most of their meals at home or out at restaurants.
Ann M. Chiaramonte, an accounting assistant with the Harvard University Dining Services, wrote in an email that these plans range in cost from around $860 to $2,500 a semester.
Tania T. Rivers-Moore ’15, a quarter-boarder at the Co-op who took last semester off to travel across the United States on a Greyhound bus, said she saves thousands of dollars by living off-campus and eating her meals in the Co-op.
“It’s still significantly cheaper,” she said. “And [all] I had to do was press one button online.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Allston Task Force voiced its support for the Boston Redevelopment Authority board review of the 28 Travis Street Project at the task force meeting Tuesday. The proposal passed by a vote of seven to two.
On Thursday, the BRA will review Harvard’s plan to move mailroom services, Harvard University Information Technology, Harvard University Police Department training, recycling and storage, and “fleet management services” from 219 Western Avenue to 28 Travis Street in North Allston.
The task force’s support for the proposal came only after the inclusion of the first phase of construction of Rena Park, a public space adjacent to the Travis Street facility, into the project plan. The addition of Rena Park represented the most recent amendment to a plan that has been discussed by Harvard, the task force, Allston community members, and the BRA for months.
If the proposal passes BRA review, Harvard will construct the 28 Travis Street facility before the beginning of the 2013-14 academic year.
“I think this is a foundation upon which we can build,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications.
Although the task force passed the proposal, some task-force members expressed their support for the 28 Travis Street project as more of a practical compromise than an enthusiastic endorsement.
Task force member Bruce E. Houghton suggested supporting the proposal as a way for the task force and the Allston community to save face in anticipation of future disputes with Harvard over its developments in Allston.
“You fought a battle, and you won part of the battle,” Houghton said at the meeting, referring to the University’s commitment to begin construction of Rena Park. “If you fight from this point forward you lose the future… I’ve got to say that the strategy now should be to fight the IMP.”
Some of the people attending the meeting remained in direct opposition to the Travis Street relocation.
“These uses are not appropriate, period, and we don’t want them here at all,” task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said. “I don’t see how we’ll ever be proud of a shooting range at 28 Travis Street,” he said, referencing the HUPD training facility slated to move there.
Tuesday’s task force meeting also focused on the construction of a residential and retail commons at the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street, also known as Barry’s Corner [LINK 1].
Leslie Cohen, senior vice president of development at Samuels & Associates, the firm Harvard has partnered with for this development, detailed the project for the task force and community members in response to 18 comment letters.
Allston residents were mainly concerned with issues of parking and traffic resulting from the influx of new residents to the neighborhood with the construction of 325 residential units. Residents also expressed a desire to see more explicit community benefits written into the development plan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of Saturday’s report that administrators secretly searched resident deans’ email accounts, it remains unclear whether University policy permits Harvard officials to conduct covert searches of student email accounts.
According to the College’s student handbook, administrators may access student email accounts in order to safeguard the system or “to ensure compliance with other University rules.” The policy does not directly address whether account owners must be notified if their emails are searched.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said in a statement that “Any assertion that Harvard routinely monitors emails—for any reason—is patently false.” He did not return a request for comment on whether the University has ever searched student email accounts, and if so, whether students must be informed of the search.
Without clear answers, the Undergraduate Council is preparing a memo that is designed to inform students about their email privacy rights and express concern to administrators about the student handbook’s ambiguities regarding the permissibility of secret searches.
In a draft of the memo, UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and UC Representative Florence Y. Chen ’15 expressed concern about the language of the handbook policy, calling the potential need “to ensure compliance with other University rules” a “vague concept.”
“This clause could potentially be stretched to allow searches under many conditions,” the draft states. “We should ask more questions about this, especially regarding whether or not students would or should receive notification about a search before the search begins.”
Raguveer said that since the news of the secret email searches broke on Saturday, she has heard from students expressing fear that their own Harvard email accounts may also be subject to monitoring.
“It’s a little frightening knowing that our emails could be checked,” Casey A. Alcantar ’13 said.
Alexander H. Martin, a student at Harvard Business School and at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, said he “share[s] the sentiment of some of the faculty” who have criticized the administration for the incident.
“It’s pretty suspect that [Harvard] would go through emails unannounced,” Martin said. “If they were to seek consent, then it’s fine.”
Some students begrudgingly acknowledged the fact that administrative access may be part of having a Harvard account.
“It’s a thing you always know using Harvard servers,” Martha R. Farlow ’13 said. “It’s a fact of using the Internet. It doesn’t mean I like it.”
Melissa J. Sieffert ’14 said she uses discretion when deciding whether or not to use her @college email account.
“I do not have any sketchy business over my Harvard email account,” Sieffert said. “[For] anything that’s personal, I use my own email.”
Ambiguities also remain about whether Harvard officials were breaking University rules when they covertly searched resident deans’ email accounts. Resident deans enjoy some faculty privileges, but it is unclear whether faculty or staff privacy rules apply to their email accounts.
The FAS email privacy policy requires administrators to notify faculty when searching their accounts, while the staff policy states that non-faculty emails “may be accessed at any time by management or by other authorized personnel for any business purpose” without notification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell became the first of Harvard’s resident deans to publicly challenge the way that administrators handled their covert search of resident deans’ email accounts last fall and the fallout since the search came to light on Saturday.
In a Boston Globe article published Tuesday morning, Howell directly contested a statement issued Monday by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, saying that administrators had “immediately informed” Howell of the searches and their results after they occurred. Last September, administrators covertly accessed resident deans’ email accounts as part of an investigation, which sought to identify the source of a leak of information pertaining to the Government 1310 cheating case.
Howell, the highest-ranking Harvard resident dean, said that while she spoke with Hammonds and other College officials about the possibility of a search before it happened, she was not informed afterward that the search had ultimately taken place. That notification did not come until the Globe contacted Harvard with the story last week.
In a separate interview with The Crimson on Tuesday, Howell also said she was concerned about the suggestion disseminated in media reports that resident deans may not be faculty—a distinction that could determine whether the University broke its own policy by secretly searching resident deans’ accounts.
“I’ve been really disheartened by the coverage that has implied over and over again that resident deans are not faculty members,” Howell said. “We’re voting members of the faculty.”
Harvard officials have not clarified which email privacy policy—faculty or staff—governs the email accounts of resident deans. While the faculty policy requires administrators to notify the account owner before a search or as soon as possible after it occurs, the policy pertaining to staff does not require any notification prior to or after a search.
Howell raised the concern once more in a letter to University President Drew G. Faust, while calling for a new and broader “conversation about integrity at Harvard.”
“What has so far been parsed in media accounts are the technical details of what happened here, but we think the more important questions this situation raises is about a critical trust as the heart of Harvard’s culture that is ours—yours—to protect or not,” Howell wrote in the letter, which was dated Monday.
Howell added that she and many other resident deans felt “dismay” upon hearing of the searches that took place “without our knowledge,” and that she worries the covert search set a dangerous tone for the University as a whole.
“Is this who we want to be? Do we want to forgo open communication in favor of secrecy and face-saving?” Howell asked in the letter. “I think that we should be able to expect more from our leaders, especially in moments of stress, when we need more than ever to work together and trust one another.”
Administrators have yet to publicly address Howell’s charges. Smith, who authorized the email search along with the University General Counsel, attended Tuesday’s regularly scheduled Administrative Board meeting, an unusual step given that he is not a member of the Board. Whether or not he addressed the assembled resident deans directly is uncertain.
Faust said in a statement Monday that she had not known about the email searches when they were happening. She said she only knew about the leaks that prompted the broader investigation and the issue’s “resolution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2013, at 4:25 a.m.
Federal civil rights attorney Mia Karvonides has begun work as Harvard’s first ever University-wide Title IX coordinator, Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman wrote in an internal announcement on Tuesday.
Coleman’s email marked Harvard’s first official announcement of the name of the person chosen to fill the new post, which was created last fall to manage compliance issues related to the gender-equity legislation.
In an emailed statement Wednesday, Karvonides wrote that she plans to familiarize herself with the Title IX coordinators at Harvard’s many schools before outlining specific priorities for compliance activities.
“First, I’d like to meet my counterparts at the school level and gain an understanding of how various parts of the University are currently coordinating compliance efforts,” she wrote.
Before coming to Harvard, Karvonides worked at the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, enforcing many of the same policies that she will oversee as the University’s Title IX officer. She has also worked as an attorney for the Vermont Agency of Education and as an administrator at Bowdoin College.
Barbara Crippen, civil rights coordinator for the Vermont Agency of Education who previously worked with Karvonides, said she believes Karvonides’s background and interests will serve her well at Harvard. At the Agency, Karvonides specialized in disability law but showed a particular aptitude for training school administrators on sexual assault issues, she said.
“She’s bright, she was a good lawyer, but I also thought her heart was more on the administrative side of things,” Crippen said.
At Harvard, Karvonides will seek to ensure that the University’s numerous schools and departments comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which forbids discrimination based on sex in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Although the legislation is widely known for increasing the participation of women in high school and collegiate sports, it also treats sexual harassment as a form of discrimination.
The sexual assault implications of Title IX have made headlines in recent months, as the OCR continues to pressure the University and its peers to reevaluate the way they handle disciplinary cases related to sexual assault. The OCR is currently investigating an outstanding Title IX complaint against Harvard Law School’s sexual assault policies, and the University has repeatedly faced pressure to adopt a set of regulatory guidelines released by the OCR in an April 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter.
Karvonides will also work with other officials to oversee the University’s compliance with the Violence Against Women Act, recently reauthorized by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 7. The new version of the bill extends the federal regulation of sexual assault disciplinary proceedings on college campuses, and may require Harvard to change the way it processes sexual harassment complaints. University spokesperson Tania M. deLuzuriaga confirmed that Karvonides will oversee sexual assault policies related to VAWA when they overlap with Title IX compliance.
According to the regulatory guidelines enforced by the OCR, any school receiving federal funding must “designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities” under Title IX. Universities are also required to notify all “students and employees of the name, office address and telephone number” of the compliance officer.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification and correction:
CLARIFICATION: March 18, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that Mia Karvonides, the new University-wide Title IX coordinator, will oversee Harvard's compliance with the Violence Against Women Act. To clarify, Karvonides will work with other officials to direct Harvard's compliance with the law.
CORRECTION: March 19, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Karvonides will outline priorities for enforcement and oversee sexual assault policies mandated by the Violence Against Women Act where they pertain to Title IX enforcement. In fact, Karvonides will direct compliance activities in these areas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seemed like it was all going to happen again. The Harvard men’s hockey team was going to make another late season run, finally playing to its potential and pushing to extend its season further into the ECAC playoffs. It was going to make up for a disappointing regular season, pull itself altogether, and make the Crimson faithful forget about its lackluster performance through most of November, December, and January.
Harvard had won Game One, stealing a 2-1 victory from Dartmouth in the first round series of the ECAC playoffs. Despite losing Game Two, the Crimson had jumped out to an early lead in Game Three, poised to salvage its season. But the Big Green had other plans, opening the floodgates with four straight goals, drowning any hopes Harvard had in accomplishing an upset as the last seed in the ECAC.
The early playoff exit may not have come as a surprise to many given the team’s regular season record, but it is this very record that was unexpected given the team’s talent and pre-season rankings. So again, as has been asked several times this year, what went wrong?
Let’s first take a look at the head coach, Ted Donato ’91, who has been at the helm of Harvard hockey since 2004 after a successful NHL career and a famed Crimson career in which he helped bring a national championship to Cambridge. The Boston native holds a career coaching record of 126-139-35 in nine seasons with Harvard. This includes four winning seasons and five losing campaigns.
Despite the overall losing record, something remains to be said about post-season performance, where the Crimson has had fairly consistent success under Donato. This year marks just the second time Harvard has been bounced from the first round during his tenure (the other in 2008-09), and the Crimson has made the ECAC Finals in four of nine years, winning a championship in 2006. Only Cornell has reached the finals more times, with five appearances in an ECAC recently characterized by parity and unpredictability. And in 2005 and 2006, Harvard earned a spot in the NCAA tournament.
Moreover, finding talent has never really been a problem for Donato, who recruits top players year after year, as evidenced by the burgeoning NHL careers of Louis LeBlanc, formerly ’13, and Alex Killorn ’12, the trio of Biega brothers, and the rookie class that suited up for the Crimson this year. This year’s roster alone boasted nine NHL draft picks.
Has it been a problem with team chemistry and cohesiveness? After a season of following the team and speaking with players, this seems unlikely. Most players are friendly off of the ice, with a significant portion of the team living together throughout the year. Moreover, the squad has periodically shown resilience, evidenced by two wins against BU – one a three-goal third-period comeback, the other in the Beanpot – and a huge upset over No. 1 Quinnipiac, its first victory against a top-ranked team since 2004.
But just when it looked like they were about to turn the corner, more setbacks and inconsistencies resurfaced, with the longest unbeaten streak of the season halted at four.
Nevertheless, Harvard must find a way to parlay its late-season life and urgency to the rest of the season in order to prevent another year in which it enters February with a losing record.
Six seniors graduate this year. Alex Fallstrom and Luke Greiner led the team in points for the Crimson, marking the second straight year Harvard will lose its top scorer. Marshall Everson led the team in goals with 11. Conor Morrison and defenseman Brenan Rempel will also depart. Captain Danny Biega, a three-time all-Ivy selection and a force both on defense and offense, will be especially missed.
Next year, the Crimson hopes to see the return of sophomores Patrick McNally and Max Everson, who should aid what was a surprisingly unproductive power play. Furthermore, in addition to another promising recruiting class, Harvard will look to the continued development of its freshmen forwards, including Ivy League Rookie of the Year Jimmy Vesey, Brian Hart, and Kyle Criscuolo, as well as top sophomores Colin Blackwell and Tommy O’Regan, to improve its ECAC-worst 2.04 goals-per-game average.
Last season, Harvard was picked to finish last in the ECAC before the season began, but finished third and lost in the ECAC finals when its season ended. This season, Harvard was picked to finish third in the ECAC but finished last and lost in the first round.  It is difficult to project where the Crimson will end up despite the strong talent it possesses. But regardless, the storied history of Harvard hockey, with which Donato is intimately familiar, implores improvement.  It may be a long way from another Frozen Four appearance, but it seems that the Crimson can only go up from here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Harvard women’s basketball team held an opponent to 26 points, President Jimmy Carter was in office and the year was 1978.
Rescheduled due to last weekend’s winter storm, Tuesday night’s game served as the last of the regular season for both the Crimson (20-8, 11-3 Ivy) and Columbia (5-23, 3-11). Harvard’s 71-26 victory at Lavietes Pavilion also served as a tune-up for the WNIT, for which the Crimson clinched an automatic bid on Saturday night.
Harvard’s 45-point margin of victory was also the largest since a 94-47 win over Central Connecticut State on Dec. 3, 2003.
“Defensively, I was very pleased,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we stuck to the scouting report and that we had few breakdowns. That is the bottom line as far as I am concerned.”
Back to back three-point jumpers by sophomore forward Erin McDonnell were part of a 15-0 run in the middle of the first half that gave Harvard a 19-4 lead it would never relinquish. That stretch featured five straight steals by a stifling Crimson defense that tallied 14 steals on the night and forced 21 turnovers in all.
“Everything they try to do is generated by the drive,” Delaney-Smith said. “We switched all screens and played off of them to make them take threes, which they didn’t hit.”
Senior guard Elle Hagedorn had a team-high four steals as part of Harvard’s defensive effort. She also scored a season-high 10 points, all of them coming in the second half.
“[Coming into the game] I was excited yet sad that it was our last game at home,” Hagedorn said. “Throughout the game my teammates did a great job pressuring the ball and that just enabled me to read the passing lanes and come up with some steals.”
By mixing a half-court press zone with a tight man defense, the Crimson held the Lions to just 10 of 49 from the field for 20-percent shooting on the night. Columbia also struggled from the charity stripe, going just two for ten.
“[The half-court press] we run is really non-traditional, and I love it,” Delaney-Smith said. “Tonight was the best I had seen us play it in a long time. There are certain things you have to do, and if you mess up you give them wide-open lay-ups. We didn’t mess up much at all tonight; they took the passing lanes away the way they are supposed to and it was very effective.”
After a slow start to the game by both teams, junior guard Christine Clark sparked Harvard’s offense six minutes into the first half.  After hitting a jumper, Clark saved an errant pass while flying into the second row. She then quickly rejoined the action to take a pass and drive hard to the basket, drawing a foul and hitting both free throws.
Clark, who went 5-6 from the field for 13 points, also had a personal 7-0 run that started with a fast-break lay-up with 14:55 left in the second half. A steal by junior guard Jasmine Evans led to another quick bucket for Clark, who then hit an open three on the next possession.
“Most of my points came off of great passes from my teammates,” Clark said. “Elle hit me for a great three, and Jasmine hit me for a break away lay-up. It was really a matter of hitting easy buckets that were set up by my teammates.”
Though she was held scoreless in the first half, senior forward Victoria Lippert had a strong second half and ended with a team-high 14 points and seven rebounds. With the Lions’ defense focusing on Lippert in the first half, Evans stepped up with eight points in just seven first-half minutes.
Although the Crimson shot well—49 percent from the field and 47 percent from deep—Delaney-Smith was not satisfied with Harvard’s offensive performance.
“I was a little disappointed with the turnovers and the decision-making on offense, as well as with our poise and fluidness,” Delaney-Smith said. “We seemed to not know what we were looking for; we missed some obvious looks. I don’t know why that keeps happening, but we shot really well despite that.”
While Delaney-Smith wasn’t pleased with the offense’s flow, Clark thinks the team’s strong defense was key to finishing the season undefeated at home.
“At halftime, we said that we had to come out and play hard,” Clark said. “[The second half] was more about really making our team better than who we were playing against… We just did a great job on defense all night and that led into our offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. First up? The No.6/7 Michigan Wolverines from the Big Ten.
Record: 25-6 (12-6 Big Ten)
Best Wins: No.17 Pittsburgh, No. 11/12 Kansas State, No. 9/10 Ohio State, No .7/8 Michigan State.
Worst Loss: at Penn State
RPI: 12
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 10
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 3
Star Players: Trey Burke (So. Guard) 19.2 ppg, 6.8 apg, Tim Hardaway Jr. (Jr. Guard) 14.8 ppg, 4.7 rpg, Glenn Robinson III (Fr. Forward) 10.9 ppg, 5.5 rpg
With Harvard projecting to be a 14 seed and Michigan a three, the Wolverines are one of the more likely matchups for Harvard in the NCAA tournament. Michigan has been one of the high profile teams in the  country all season and for good reason. Hardaway and Robinson, the sons of retired NBA stars Tim Hardaway and Glenn Robinson II, may not be as good as their Dads were, but they would be noteworthy without the famous last names (and the first names, way to be original, guys). 
But its Burke that really makes the Wolverine offense go. The sophomore guard has really come into his own this season and is one of 15 finalists for the Wooden National Player of the Year Award. Harvard freshman point guard Siyani Chambers has had a breakout season of his own, but he has not had to match up with anyone as quick and dynamic of a scorer and distributor as Burke. The closest Chambers has seen was UConn’s Shabazz Napier back on Dec. 7, and though Napier was limited to six points on two-of-seven shooting from the field, he also snagged seven rebounds and dished out nine assists while limiting Chambers to three points and forcing five turnovers. Chambers has gotten better since then, but Burke still has a definitive edge.
But if the Crimson was to solely match-up one-on-one at each position it would be smoked by almost all of its potential opponents. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has done a great job at increasing the talent level on his Crimson squads, but most three seeds have one, if not more, NBA-level talent; that's just not the case for Harvard. What matters more if the Crimson wants to win a tournament game for the first time in program history is if it can land a team that won’t totally take advantage of its two biggest weaknesses: size and speed. Here, Amaker and co. might be in luck—kind of.
The Wolverines only have one player, 6’10” freshman forward Mitch McGary, over 6’8” that gets any significant playing time. With the emergence of sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith down low, there likely won’t be an incredible mismatch in the post which has been the Crimson’s weakest point all season. Unfortunately for Harvard, that’s just about where the good news stops. Michigan has one of the most efficient offenses in the country, ranking second in Adjusted Offense according to Pomeroy, and is battle-tested after making it through the country’s deepest and most talented conference this year. 
On the bright side, the Wolverines have yet to play a truly impressive game away from Ann Arbor, but no matter where the team’s end up playing it’s an almost certainty that there will be more Michigan fans than Crimson faithful. In all likelihood, Burke will do this and Harvard will be sent packing in the first round again. But it’s called March Madness for a reason, and crazier things than a Crimson victory over the Wolverines have happened.

With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset. Here, we take a look at the No. 15 New Mexico Lobos from the Mountain West.
Record: 26-5 (13-3 Mountain West)
Best Wins: Colorado State (twice), San Diego State, Cincinnati, UConn
Worst Losses: at Air Force, vs. South Dakota State
RPI: 2
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 26
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 3
Star Players: Kendall Williams (Jr. Guard) 14.0 ppg, 5.0 apg, Alex Kirk (So. Center) 12.1 ppg, 8.2 rpg
In last year’s NCAA Tournament, the Harvard men’s basketball team squared off against Vanderbilt in The Pit, the home arena of the New Mexico Lobos in Albuquerque, N.M.
Though The Pit is not one of the game sites for this year’s iteration of The Big Dance, the Crimson’s lofty title goals may once again run through New Mexico, as the regular-season Mountain West Champion Lobos are a potential first-round opponent for Tommy Amaker and Co.
Should Harvard (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) meet No. 15 New Mexico, its most obvious disadvantage lies close to the basket. The Lobos’ starting lineup boasts sophomore seven-footer Alex Kirk and 6’9” junior forward Cameron Bairstow, who average a combined 13.8 rebounds per game. Together, Kirk and Bairstow could cause major problems for the Crimson frontcourt, which ranks last in the Ancient Eight in team rebounding. Harvard’s trio of sophomore bigs, Kenyatta Smith (6’8”), Jonah Travis (6’6”), and Steve Moundou-Missi (6’7”) will have their hands full with Kirk, who averages 12.1 points per contest and shoots 70.7 percent from the charity stripe.
New Mexico junior guard Kendall Williams, who was recently honored as the Mountain West Player of the Year, is the Lobos’ biggest scoring threat. Though his season average is just 14.0 points a game, he has the potential to heat up and terrorize opposing defenses. In New Mexico’s Feb. 23 win over conference rival Colorado State, Williams exploded for 46 points, converting on 10 of 13 attempts from downtown. Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders, the squad’s best perimeter defender and most prolific scorer, would likely be tasked with defending Williams.
Defensively, the Lobos are led by guard Tony Snell, who stands at 6’7” and uses his length and quickness to harass opposing guards. Snell would likely be assigned to contain Saunders, the Ivy League’s leading scorer at 16.5 points a game. Behind Snell, Kirk is the Mountain West’s top shot blocker, averaging 1.8 per contest.
But in spite of New Mexico’s strengths, the team has turned in a few dismal performances this season. The Lobos’ offense relies heavily on its jump shooting, which has been spotty at times, including a season-worst showing against San Diego State. New Mexico shot 25% from the field en route to a 55-34 shellacking at the hands of the Aztecs. If Harvard were to catch the Lobos on an off-shooting day, it could have a shot at pulling off the Cinderella upset.
The guard play of freshman Siyani Chambers would also be key for the Crimson in its potential matchup with New Mexico. He would start opposite sophomore Hugh Greenwood, who is a proficient facilitator, but lacks Chambers’ athleticism. Chambers is a bigger scoring threat than Greenwood, averaging over five points per game more than the sophomore. Harvard’s chances of knocking off the Lobos will be significantly higher if Chambers has a strong performance in the first NCAA Tournament contest of his collegiate career.
Overall, New Mexico’s combination of a dominant frontcourt, explosive scoring, and effective defending make the squad a daunting first-round opponent. ESPN’s Seth Davis recently tweeted that the Lobos are the non-BCS team (excluding No. 1 Gonzaga) with the best shot at reaching the Final Four. If the Crimson is paired with New Mexico on Selection Sunday, it would need a stellar outing from its freshman point guard and a little bit of luck to stop the Mountain West Champions from getting there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team hosted Sacred Heart Wednesday night in its first conference game since mid-February in the Malkin Athletic Center and, despite a brief hiccup in the third set, managed to take care of business and secure the win.
The Crimson (11-4, 6-3 EIVA) won the first two matches, both by a score of 25-16, but fell short to the Pioneers (2-14, 1-8) in the third frame, 25-21. In the last set, the two teams exchanged points until Harvard was finally able to steal the decisive two-point margin for a 31-29 victory.
“We won a close one,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “That kind of feels good.”
The Crimson was not able to collect its fourth consecutive sweep at home, but with the 3-1 victory over the Pioneers, Harvard picked up its 10th consecutive win in its own gym.
It was 4-4 in the first frame when the home squad took the lead and didn’t relinquish it the rest of the set. The Crimson held a .417 kill percentage and 13 kills in the frame, while Sacred Heart collected its lowest of the night at eight.
“We played real sharp in the first two [sets],” head coach Brian Baise said.
Madden logged a game-high 16 kills, and freshman outside hitter Brendan Clemens was second with 13 to help bring their team to a total of 52 for the night.
“I think we were pretty loose and relaxed going into the game,” Madden said. “That’s why we played really well.”
Harvard managed its largest lead of eight points four times throughout the second set, after breaking from a 3-3 tie at the start. The Pioneers called their first time-out to try to stop the run, but it proved unsuccessful, as the Crimson went on to take the set. Harvard had a .471 kill percentage compared to .389 for the night, while holding Sacred Heart to .169 for the match.
“I think we were serving really well,” Madden said. “We looked really in sync on offense, we were just really flowing well together.”
The Crimson collected 13 team blocks, with the highest amount coming from sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick, who had eight. The Pioneers collected only two team blocks for the night.
“I think the biggest thing for us was our blocking, a lot weren’t going off of hands and out of bounds,” Madden said.
Things took a different turn in the third frame, as errors began to add up for Harvard.
“Mentally, we broke down a bit,” Baise said. “We talk about, when there’s an error, trying to ‘better that ball,’ but we kept compounding error on error.”
The Crimson called its first time-out of the night with the score 7-3, but a kill from the Pioneers kept their streak going until the 25-21 victory. Sacred Heart built a six-point lead three times in the frame and took the victory off an error by Clemens.
“We got a little bit too complacent in the third,” Madden said.  “We started letting it slip against a team we know we can beat. That’s frustrating, and that frustration can be a little difficult to get out of.”
“We missed three of our four serves in game three and that sort of set the tone,” Baise said. “We never recovered from there.”
Clemens came out with a statement in the fourth, smacking the ball over the net for the first kill in the fourth. Blocking picked up three consecutive points for Harvard, bringing the squad its largest lead of the set at 10-5.
“Sacred Heart definitely played scrappy in the fourth game,” Madden said. “They were hustling, getting the balls up, and we had to come and match that to get the win.”
Sacred Heart increased its energy on the court as the score narrowed, and neither team led by more than two points in the second half of the set. The Pioneers had the first shot at match point, when senior setter Rob Lothman put Zimmick up for an important kill. The Crimson went through three more servers, holding match point four times before the 31-29 win came on an error by Sacred Heart’s junior outside hitter Jose Juelle.
The crowd was on its feet with every point in the suspenseful final minutes.
“I don’t feel like we let up,” Baise said.
Going forward, Harvard hopes to avoid games with such disparities in its play across sets.
“It was almost two different matches,” added Baise. “We have to put together a complete match, a little bit of consistency, and the confidence to know that we can do that would be key.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Princeton’s loss to Brown on Saturday clinched Harvard’s bid to the NCAA tournament, the Crimson hasn’t had much to do but practice and dream, waiting for its first-round opponent and location to be announced this Sunday.
ESPN’s resident bracket wizard, Joe Lunardi, currently projects Harvard as a 14-seed, and unless some wacky things happen in the mid-major conference tournaments this week, its seed won’t climb any higher than that. This would match the Crimson up against a 3-seed, which makes an upset a daunting challenge. In the last decade, only three 14-seeds have won their first NCAA tournament game. If Harvard is to pull off the improbable next week, what type of opponent should it look for?
The Crimson’s recent ascendance in the Ivy League has come about not because of some regimented offensive sets or revolutionary playing style, but because Tommy Amaker has recruited excellent talent to Cambridge, specifically in the form of players whose skill sets are not often found in the Ancient Eight. Your average Ivy recruit scores with deadeye shooting, nifty back cuts, or wily post moves; sophomore guard Wesley Saunders’ offensive strategy is “I’m stronger than you,” and it was awfully effective all season.
But Harvard likely won’t have that athletic advantage against one of the top-seeded, big-conference squads with which it will be matched on Sunday. As its last two postseason outings have proven, the types of teams that the Crimson struggles to compete with are those that play a fast style with athletes superior to its own. The size and athleticism of Oklahoma State in 2011 and Vanderbilt in 2012 flustered Harvard, particularly Ivy Player of the Year Keith Wright, who found it quite difficult to bully the Commodores’ Festus Ezeli, a first-round pick in that year’s NBA Draft, in the same way that he did the big men of the Ivy League.
Offering more hope is the Crimson’s performance against non-Ivy tournament teams this season. Harvard proved it can hang around with athletic teams in hostile environments in losses to Connecticut on Dec. 7 and Memphis on Jan. 19. Despite trailing by as many as 20 points and getting outrebounded on the offensive glass, 16-3, the Crimson managed to grab the lead from the Tigers with seven minutes remaining and was within four with under two minutes to play before ultimately falling, 60-50.
Harvard’s most impressive nonconference win came on a visit to Berkeley to take on Pac-12 opponent California. Led by junior co-captain Laurent Rivard’s 19 points, the Crimson overcame an ugly 36.7 shooting percentage to sneak by the Golden Bears, 67-62. “This don’t make no sense,” Cal guard Allen Crabbe tweeted after the game.
The Crimson’s best chance to extend its Cinderella story this March will come as the result of turning the game into a slow defensive slog, reminiscent of its upset of Florida St. in last season’s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. Harvard hung with the No. 20 Seminoles through a combination of stingy defense and abominable shooting that resulted in, among other things, a 14-14 halftime score. If you haven’t worked that one out with your therapist yet, I’m sorry for bringing it up.
Whoever it plays, the Crimson won’t win if its opponent brings its best game, so its best chance of success is against a team that has a style of play that exposes it to more risk. This ideal team shoots a lot of threes and doesn’t have the type of overpowering size that would allow it to get easy buckets against Harvard’s small front line. Interestingly enough, this team might just be Amaker’s previous employer, the Michigan Wolverines, currently projected by Lunardi as a three seed—though leading Wooden Award candidate Trey Burke might do some unmentionable things to the Crimson backcourt.
The team Harvard matches up worst with might be the Wolverines’ cross-state rival, the Spartans of Michigan State, who Lunardi currently has the Crimson slated to play in Auburn Hills, Mich. Frenzied home crowd notwithstanding, the Spartans would dominate Harvard athletically at every position, from slick 6’1” point guard Keith Appling to its rugged frontcourt of 270-pound Derrick Nix and 6’10” Adreian Payne, an NBA first-round prospect.
Ultimately, the Crimson’s projected opponent may change quite a bit in the next few days, as the top squads duke it out in their respective conference tournaments. But if Harvard is to advance against whichever team it finds itself matched up against, it will have to do what it hasn’t been afraid to do against other big-time foes in recent seasons: play ugly.

Scott Brown, perhaps Massachusetts' favorite Republican, is moving back into the private sector. The former U.S. Senator will transition from making laws to reading them when he joins Nixon Peabody, a respected Boston law firm, both parties announced Monday afternoon.
 
Brown acknowledged the move on Twitter shortly before noon Monday, writing that he was "looking forward to working with the firm and its national efforts." Despite losing his seat in the Senate to Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren last November, Brown has retained his popularity with Massachusetts voters. He surprised many by not seeking Secretary of State John F. Kerry's open Senate seat. 
 
"During my time in politics, I never hesitated to reach across the aisle to work with members of any political party to secure a preferable outcome," Brown said in a statement. "My approach is consistent with the way Nixon Peabody does business and I believe we can be successful together."
 
At Nixon Peabody, Brown will use his connections to the government, business, and real estate sectors to advance the firm's profile in those areas, according to the press release. Brown himself has significant ties to the financial services industry, which donated generously to his recent campaigns. 
 
Brown, however, will not officially lobby for the firm, at least not yet. As a former Senator, he must wait until January 2, 2015 to do so. 
 
Brown is not the first ex-politico to join the Boston practice. New York Republican Thomas M. Reynolds, a five-term Congressman, leads the firm's Government Relations department, a branch which, according to Nixon Peabody's website, advises clients on matters ranging from legal compliance to legislative advocacy.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Eliot historically housed the rich and the famous of Harvard undergraduates: those students with last names such as Cabot, Lowell, and Adams. Though housing randomization has done away with its exclusivity, Eliot's rich community and classic Harvard facilities make it one of the most desirable Houses on campus. With an expansive, hammock-filled courtyard, beautiful river views, and close proximity to classes in the Yard, residents are hard-pressed to name drawbacks of their beloved Domus. This year, Eliot maintains its second place position in the House rankings.
House Spirit: Eliot residents show fierce pride for their House, as evidenced by the massive turnout of "Domus"-chanting students in the Yard on Housing Day. A core group of intensely spirited HoCo members plan numerous community events. At the House charity auction, for example, attendees can bid on an intimate dinner with the House Masters or cooking lessons taught by the kitchen staff.
Instead of the usual two annual formal affairs, Eliot boasts three: September Soirée, a winter formal, and "Fête." Tickets to this widely-attended spring formal are so coveted that stories of gatecrashers trying to circumvent security are commonplace. However, as elegant as these formal affairs may be, residents say it is the many smaller, more personal events, such as Stein Clubs and entryway study breaks, that go far in creating a tight-knit community at Eliot.
 
Housing Quality: Though the endemic issue of tight quarters for sophomores on the River does not spare Eliot, the prospects for upperclassmen are bright. Seniors are guaranteed n+1 housing, which means singles for most. Options for upperclass students include massive party suites like "Ground Zero" and the "Cockpit," which are complete with multiple common rooms and Eliot-crested beer pong tables. Plus, majestic river views can prove a boon to what can sometimes be crowded quarters.
 
Dining Hall: Though Eliot's dining hall—complete with dark wood paneling and ornate chandeliers—may appear imposing, House residents name it as a central location for studying and socializing. With the dining hall tucked away between Winthrop and Kirkland, relatively few non-Eliot dwellers venture to there for meals, which enhances a strong sense of House camaraderie. Eliot lives up to its posh reputation at its weekly "Home to Eliot" events, where white tablecloths are laid out for a special community dinner event. Students rave about the friendly HUDS staff, who know many of their patrons by name. The outdoor terrace proves a pleasant location for dining during the warmer autumn and spring months.
 
Facilities: Though perhaps not as spacious as those in more recently built Houses, Eliot's facilities are well-used. The sunny library, which is rumored to contain a secret passage, is a wonderful place to sit back with a book and channel your inner James Joyce, whose grandson resided in the House. (Incidentally, Stephen Joyce '54 roomed with a grandson of Henri Matisse and a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Eliot A-12, but it's whatever.) The Eliot Grille, with its 1950s-style checkered floor, serves late night snacks all week long, and students say they use the Grille as a prime spot for studying or relaxing among friends.
 
House Masters: Despite their somewhat recent arrival as House Masters, in 2011, Doug A. Melton and Gail A. O'Keefe are already well integrated constants in House life, according to Eliot residents. Melton frequently challenges undergrads to squash matches, in which he often triumphs. The pair can be found on most nights in the dining hall, eating informally alongside undergrads and tutors. After struggling to think of a negative aspect to life in Eliot, Melton rightfully noted that the House is a fair distance from the labs in the northwest area of campus, where he spends much of his time as a professor of natural sciences.
Extra: Although Eliot is quite far from many of the buildings north of the Science Center, athletes will be especially appreciative of the House's back gate, which provides easy access to the Weld Boathouse and the athletic facilities across the Anderson Memorial bridge to Eliot residents only. Happily for the non-varsity athletes among us, Eliot proves a perennial powerhouse in IM crew. Residents have a special attachment to their House motto, "Floreat Domus de Eliot," using the sole word "domus" as a frequent chant and adornment on House swag. Residents say that in a world where students' identities are less tied to their Houses than they may have been in the days of Harvard yesteryear, life in Eliot is indeed flourishing.
Our rankings so far:
2. Eliot
3. Kirkland
4. Adams
5. Cabot
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell
8. Pforzheimer
9. Mather

This is the twelfth and last post in Flyby's 2013 Housing Market series. From all of us at Flyby, have a very happy Housing Day!
Quincy House has managed to maintain a strong sense of community this year despite the dispersion of residents in swing housing throughout the Square while Old Quincy undergoes renovation. Next year, the wait will be over, and Old Quincy will be the newest housing on campus. Those freshmen lucky enough to land a spot in (new) Old Quincy will find the best of both worlds—spacious, modern, and well-appointed rooms within a facade that maintains Harvard's neo-Georgian flair—all just steps from both the River and the Square.
House Spirit: Penguin pride is fierce every day of the year, but residents point to the House's special events as particular rallying points for their community. Quincy kicks off the fall semester with a popular House-wide field day. Other spirited annual traditions include Josiah Quincy's birthday dinner and "Quincy's Got Talent." Quincy camradarie shines through during the holiday season each winter, when the Quincy House Committee solicits small donations from students that are then bundled and presented to the House's maintenance workers and HUDS staff as year-end bonuses. Recently, Quincy's House Masters, tutors, and students alike stepped up to help a tutor who was proposing to her longtime girlfriend by participating in a choreographed flashmob, which one Penguin described as "magical."
 
Dining Hall: As almost any Harvard student can tell you (because nearly everyone eats in Quincy at some point), "New" Quincy just isn't that new anymore—and, unfortunately, it's not the most picturesque of buildings on our campus. Quincy's dining hall represents the height of this aging modernity, but at least the tables are dark wood. Since Quincy rarely has interhouse dining restrictions, the large dining hall is often crowded with non-Penguins. On weeknights, it can be quite noisy and difficult to find a seat.
Ask any Quincy resident, however, and they'll tell you that the well-lit space, complete with long tables and four-tops alike, is one of the best parts of Quincy. Having such a constant stream of people coming through Quincy to eat means that the dining hall is not just the epicenter of a dynamic House life, but that it is also a rare centralized common space for Harvard upperclassmen of all Houses. And for a dining hall that serves so many students each day, the food they turn out is impressively tasty.
 
Housing Quality: Those who manage to snag rooms in the newly renovated Old Quincy will be some of the luckiest students at Harvard. From what we can tell, the only downside of the new floor plans is that they include hall bathrooms. Other than that, renewed Old Quincy promises to provide some of the best in Harvard living, with multitudinous singles, ample common spaces, full kitchens in every tutor suite (study breaks just got so much better), duplex residential suites, University-provided furniture, and elevators. (Old) New Quincy, though perhaps less aesthetically pleasing, provides residents with reliably spacious quarters, and long hallways foster a sense of community that can be difficult to find in other Houses.
 
Facilities: (New) Old Quincy will include a new "multi-purpose" room with glass walls and doors as well as a terrace for House events and barbecues. Another highlight of next year's Old Quincy is the small study niches slated to occupy that awkward space under the eaves of those oh-so-Old-Harvard slanted roofs. Residents cite Quincy Grille as one of the best amenities the House has to offer, and speak affectionately of the greasy late-night food and convenient social space it provides.
House Masters: House Masters Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke get rave reviews from Penguins, who praise them as thoughtful, generous, and involved with House life. Quincy residents say their House Masters are committed to fostering a vibrant community, and students flock to events like "Deb's Paint Bar" for a chance to paint with their artist-in-residence. The Masters also host Senior Dinners, Super Bowl parties, and open houses in their penthouse residence in New Quincy.
 
Extra: Quincy holds the distinction of being the only wheelchair-accessible River House. Penguins enjoy frequent games on the House's centrally located ping pong table. Finally, Quincy is home to the "Qube," a library that serves as a quiet study space 24/7 and is also rumored to have an outstanding comic book collection (which students can explore upon request).
Flyby's complete 2013 House rankings:
1. Quincy
2. Eliot
3. Kirkland
4. Adams
5. Cabot
6. Winthrop
7. Lowell

Freshmen, it's here: Housing Day. Seeing as it may (or may not) define the next three years of your life, here are some tips so that you don't mess it up.
1. River Run is Not Primal Scream
Just because both events involve cardio does not mean that they are the same. So keep your clothes on, please! No one wants to see what seven months of d-hall froyo has done to your physique. Also, doing laps around the yard will do nothing to prevent you from being quaded.
2. Make the Best of Your House
Like the saying goes, when God gives you a bad house, make lemonade out of your tears. The salt brings out the lemon and it gets people to feel bad for you! Last year people felt so sorry for me that I got placed in Dunster that they didn't mind that I was eating all the lemon squares at the Lowell Masters' open house, or that I left Clover without paying the bill.
3.  Don't Be the Crier
There is always that one kid that cries on housing day. I was that kid. Everyone remembers. I mean everyone. My blockmates, my professors, that tourist that videotaped me. If you are going to cry (so that you can crash Adams' Stein Club as well) just make sure that someone else is crying louder. This can be done easily with a solid jab to the face.
4. Don't worry about missing out
Housing Day is basically a midterm; you stay up all night, stress-eating muffin tops in the d-hall, and then run around screaming when you find out that all the drinking you did the night before did nothing to help you get your desired result. So don't worry about missing Housing Day, or your midterm for that matter. They are basically interchangeable.
