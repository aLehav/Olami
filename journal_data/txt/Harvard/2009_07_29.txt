After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AHMEDABAD, India – Nearly two months after its release in America, a screwball comedy about four friends in Las Vegas has become a surprising hit thousands of miles from its Sin City setting. The Hangover certainly makes for an unlikely sell on the megaplex marquee in a country predominantly driven by religious convictions, where conservative attitudes toward premarital sex, drugs, interracial marriage, and even dating resonate deeply. But the film’s popularity demonstrates a challenge to these foundations of culture in India, revealing a younger generation perhaps as much in step with Western pop culture as their American counterparts. 
“Western culture” is perhaps the greatest marketing success story in history. In India, working for an American company serves as a source of pride. American designers—the so-called “high-end brands”— flood the malls, and some Indian retailers advertise items as “export quality,” a label that marks clothing deemed suitable for only the most fashion-savvy. 
Over a generation ago, the more procurable “Green Card” craze brought many Indians (including my own parents) overseas for greater opportunity—suitors for marriage then labeled “export-quality” spouses. Today, even in a country whose growth outstrips America’s, the weight of Western ideas is ever growing, even as American immigration borders are drawn tighter. Is this attempt at emulating Western culture indicative of mistaken perceptions—perceptions that characterize Indians as desperately in need of a culture other than their own?
The pull from abroad highlights Indian culture, still rooted in humility and family, as seemingly incompatible with the supply of rising incomes. Tastes turn to the West, visible even in the hallmark of Indian entertainment—Bollywood—as more expensive movies are filmed in foreign locations and now often feature Hindi subtitles with spoken English. (A Bollywood remake of The Hangover is due next year.) Admittedly, it would be misleading to overstate these generalizations—yet they are overtly glaring to an Indian-American.
It would be presumptuous to believe on one end that Indians need the infusion of Western culture as a step toward “civilization,” when their own culture predates Western ideas by several millennia (so forgo any “White Man’s Burden”)—and at the other, that India is still stuck in its past, and likes it that way. Arranged marriage is out, the once exceptional “love marriage” now almost the rule. More women work outside the home, and a recent high court decision decriminalized homosexuality. Clubs, bars, and restaurants cater to both Western tastes and a growing middle-class with ever more disposable income. But isn’t it odd that even recent cinematic history still records India’s rise from slums-to-riches as possible only with the Western helping hand—an adaptation of America’s Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
Whether Indians truly want the infusion of Western ideas is still unclear. Do they genuinely like The Hangover, or does its association with Western culture simply contribute to India’s own credibility as “modern”? In countries like India, citizens deserve to make their own decisions about pop cultural preferences and tastes. Portraying Western culture as inherently superior—and the only legitimate form of modern culture—infringes upon that right. 
The “backwards” attitude sometimes projected toward the developing world, one that has plagued American foreign policy for over a century, has become obsolete. In the end, subjective standards underline the semantic distinction between developed and developing—which suggests a dominance of the former’s culture, as well as its economic system and political activities. It is this complex that likely invites anti-American hostility from abroad. But so as long as we acknowledge our own faults, failures, and weaknesses, and maintain respect for others’ political and cultural sovereignties, countries will see no need to slam the door on American “meddling.”
India is not a colony to be ruled or a market to be capitalized, but a country of its own, with unwritten stories of slumdog millionaires that outnumber America’s four-to-one. Why say that India lags a decade behind the U.S., when its course should be its own? History has already written the American path toward economic and cultural modernization. Now, let India have its turn.

MITOYO CITY, Japan—While my host family generally expects me to help with chores around the house, one task is strictly off limits: taking out the trash. “It's just too difficult for foreigners,” she tells me. Perhaps Japan’s strict garbage disposal regulations are as daunting to an outside visitor as Tokyo’s crisscrossed subway map and a writing system with three different alphabets. 
In Mitoyo City, where I am interning and living in a home-stay, trash is sorted into 18 categories, which range from burnable waste, to metallic trash, to used tempura oil. City residents divide up their own waste and deliver it to nearby collection stations on designated days. This means that every second Thursday of the month, my host parents transport their plastic waste to the collection site near city hall – except, of course, on the second Thursday of an even-numbered month, during which plastic bottles, and not common plastics, are collected. Before they do this, however, they must drive to the nearby supermarket to purchase city-approved trash disposal bags, without which garbage is not received. Each bag costs 30 Yen.  And, of course, they must also be sure to remove plastic coverings and bottle caps (considered common plastics), and remember to wash the bottles thoroughly. They repeat the process on Tuesday, but for burnable waste and recyclable glass. 
While originally intended to reduce the amount of landfill waste in land-scarce Japan, these stringent regulations have also managed to reshape many residents’ views about trash and wastefulness. When doing groceries, my host mother seeks products with minimal wrapping—hoping to avoid the hassle of having sort through these later. My host siblings diligently wash out their plastic soda bottles before dumping them in the appropriate bin; they now tend to opt for milk when thirsty—it’s easier to dispose of. 
I expected the remoteness of the Japanese countryside to allow me to relax and sort through my thoughts. I certainly did not expect to find myself sorting through my trash. Yet, painstaking as the process is, I find that I, too, am starting to rethink my wasteful ways. At school, I take for granted the blessing that is co-mingled recycling, and too often find myself letting a recyclable or two slip into the trash bag when the appropriate bin is too full or too far.  Ironically, the simplicity of trash disposal back home discourages me from being more proactive about recycling. Physically sorting my common plastics and special plastics while in Japan has literally made me grasp the dirty truth: My ways are simply too wasteful and clearly unsustainable.

NEW ORLEANS, La. – One of the few days that we go out for lunch, we find ourselves waiting 45 minutes for our food. It’s a little sit-down restaurant two blocks from the office, and at half past noon, the place is full but not bustling. The waitress comes over and refills our glasses.  “Sorry about the wait,” she says. “We’ve got about 12 Lutherans eating upstairs.” “Volunteers?” my co-worker asks. “They’re rebuilding the city, one house at a time,” she says, rolling her eyes.
I’ve seen the Lutherans, mostly packs of high school students, choking up the narrow sidewalks of the French Quarter. The Times-Picayune reports that about 37,000 of them are in town for a convention. The locals stare at these visitors who take pictures of streetcars, wait for the signal to let them cross empty intersections, and wear conspicuously colorful “Jesus Justice Jazz” t-shirts.
New Orleans has a conflicted relationship with the hordes of do-gooders who descend upon the city. On the one hand, it’s nice to have help, especially after what many consider gross neglect by Washington in the aftermath of Katrina. Yet there’s plenty of mistrust, not only because of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s blunders—formaldehyde-laced trailers, for example—but also because when you’re the destination for so many mission trips and “disaster tours,” you might begin to wonder if the rest of America actually sees you as fellow citizens. A popular bumper sticker even declares, “Louisiana: Third World and Proud of It”. And there are those inescapable issues of race and class: Many of the residents are poor and black, while the do-gooders are white and college-educated.
The Lower Ninth Ward sums it up well. Post-Katrina flooding wiped out entire blocks of what used to be a densely populated part of the city. Except for some awkwardly sleek new houses courtesy of Brad Pitt, lots lie abandoned and weed-ridden. Yet even along the canal, a few surviving shotgun cottages sit crumbling in defiance, facing the levee (watched over by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) that so spectacularly failed them four years ago.  A city just giving the world the finger—there’s something very American about that.

KYETUME, Uganda—It took me no fewer than five clumsy introductions to catch on to why I kept forgetting the names of people here. The distinct sounds that natives uttered after I’d casually call myself only “Ahmed” weren’t first names that came in the form of two or three Lugandan words. Rather, I eventually discovered, when Ugandans tell new acquaintances their names, they often do so in reverse order: They say their last name first, followed by their first name.
Intrigued by this simple-sounding observation, I asked one of the project leaders of the NGO for which I’m working to explain. After the hour-long discussion that ensued with Nakalinzi Maureen (last name first), I came away with not only a newfound awareness of Ugandan culture, but also with a deeper appreciation of my own last name.
For ages, Uganda has been divided into several kingdoms. (Even today, three kingdoms remain politically significant.) Like all Ugandan kingdoms, Buganda—of which Maureen is technically a subject and whose terrain spans the central portion of the country—puts a premium on surnames.
A Bugandan’s last name is what brands him or her as a member of the Bugandan kingdom, Maureen told me. And the further you go down the name hierarchy, she said—to the tribe and then the clan levels—the more prominent a social role a last name plays. For example, though membership to any one clan can number in the thousands, no two people of the same clan—that is, two people out of hundreds who share the same last name—can marry.
But being part of a certain clan and possessing a certain last name are not the products of lineage. The aftermath of the Rwandan genocide exemplifies why. After the barbarous bloodbath 15 years ago, the Bugandan territory played host to an influx of Rwandan refugees. But rather than integrate, the displaced peoples assimilated in the most extreme way, Maureen told me—they adopted the surnames of Bugandan people. And even in this exaggerated case, the same social rules would (and did) apply to Rwandan immigrants who took on Bugandan surnames:
Despite phenotypic and genetic dissimilarities, the refugees’ new last names prevented them from marrying other clan members—whether of Ugandan or even Rwandan origin—and entirely replaced their former identities.
Unlike most Western and Indo-European cultures—in which last names are passed down in a male-dominated system, from father to son—clan names ultimately cut across blood lines in Uganda, making the clan, and not the father, the fundamental source of authority, Maureen said.
In our country, it’s erroneous to place too much emphasis on any one person or group when we discuss familial allegiance and social organization. As Americans, we readily admit the individualistic nature of our citizenry: 18-year-olds eagerly await the day they can move out of the homes of their parents—with whom they share a last name—to live on their own, for example. And relatives who reside in different cities or states can go without seeing other family members for months at a time, until holidays once or twice a year—if even that.
Wherever she is in Uganda, Maureen’s surname identifies her as a clan member of the kingdom of Buganda, one of thousands of people who assign social authority to the same group. Wherever I am in America, in contrast, my name identifies me as an individual, with allegiance principally to myself.
And while it seems unsettling to exist as a unit of one, it is still undeniably liberating not to be bound by a system of social control that stems from the six letters that follow my first name.

SALAMANCA, Spain—Young people from all over the world flock to Spain for its legendary party scene. And in the summers, local teenagers really live the good life. Here, it feels like every night is the weekend. Although considerably less crowded during the work week, bars stay open late (‘til around 2 or 3a.m.) and many discotecas have just barely gotten started by 4a.m. On the weekends, it’s not uncommon to see partygoers stumbling home in the previous day’s clothes at 7 or even 8 in the morning. Much of the time, they fall into bed, sleep until lunch time, nap again during siesta, and then hang around with friends until it is time to go out once more. 
I once asked a Spanish friend how this kind of nocturnal lifestyle was sustainable. Do these kids have summer jobs, or internships, or volunteer work, or anything at all that they have to do during the day? For the vast majority, the answer is: not really. Young people here are generally expected to focus on only one thing at a time. During the school year, academics alone occupy a student’s time. Given that entry into university is solely dependent on one’s grades and exam scores, extracurriculars, sports, community service, and work experience are of relatively little importance.  Consequently, during summer breaks, most are free to do as they please.
Compared to the eternally crazy schedules of many American teenagers, this approach seems rather refreshing. In the states, high school students often juggle dozens of activities on top of their schoolwork, and increasingly plan out overly busy summers in order to impress universities.  But having been here for almost four weeks now, I feel that there is something wanting in the lives of the local Spanish teenagers who seem almost singularly occupied with having fun. Certainly, most American students would eagerly welcome more carefree summers, but the experience of working a part-time job, of interning at a political office, or of tutoring younger children gives one a sense of responsibility and purpose that is satisfying in its own way. I can’t help but feel that in the long run, the pleasure derived from these types of activities is far more valuable and meaningful than the trivial amusement drawn from endless nights of partying.

JERUSALEM, Israel — In the United States, the issue of “loyalty to the state” smacks of extreme right-wing xenophobia, the sort that characterized, say, the McCarthy Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. 
But the issue of loyalty isn’t such a joke in Israel. 
Established in just 1948, this small nation has engaged in at least four wars since then, each of which defended and expanded its territories in the midst of hostile neighbors, creating an ongoing, bloody fight for survival. And the random acts of terrorism that were for so long a fixture of daily life in Jerusalem bring that struggle to the forefront even in times of “peace.” 
Because it occupies such a precarious position and must constantly thwart existential threats, Israel has no choice but to raise the question of loyalty to the state, especially when at least a percentage of its Arab population wishes for Israel’s dissolution. This is not to say that the issue of loyalty in this small nation doesn’t sometimes exude the same right-wing xenophobia that it does in the U.S.—just ask Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who wouldn’t seem to mind if all of Israel’s Arabs simply disappeared from the population. 
 Last week, however, Education Minister Gideon Saar made the controversial decision to remove the term “al-naqba” from textbooks in Israel’s Arab schools. “Al-naqba,” or, in English, “the catastrophe,” describes how some Arabs view the State of Israel’s 1948 establishment. While some outspoken leaders of Israel’s Arab community are outraged over the decision on grounds of “repression” of Arab cultural heritage, Israel simply cannot afford to subsidize an education that would encourage children to demonize the state. 
Although in recent years Israel might have become a “safer” place to live, it still faces the same existential threat it did over 60 years ago. It doesn't need an internal struggle as well; the external one more than compensates. It makes perfect sense, then, that the government would prevent young Arabs from learning (in schools, at least) to consider the state’s creation a “catastrophe.” And who would fault Israel for doing what it can to prevent a sense of disloyalty from unraveling the very fabric of its existence from the inside out?
But, while we’re on the subject, there’s another story that needs to be told. 
During roughly the same week that Saar decided to remove “al-naqba” from textbooks in Arab schools, a real “catastrophe” exploded in the usually quiet, solemn streets of West Jerusalem’s Mea Shearim neighborhood. There, Jews of the ultra-orthodox Toldot Aharon sect protested en masse the arrest of a mother of five, taken into custody for starving her three-year-old son until he weighed no fewer than seven kilograms. Toldot Aharon is among the most conservative Hasidic sects that constitute Jerusalem’s ultra-orthodox Eda Haredim community, and, as an anti-Zionist organization, the sect considers any outside intervention (such as the arrest of one of its members by the “Zionist” Israeli authorities) cause for revolt. Hence the violent demonstrators hurling stones into crowds of nearby police officers and civilians, several of whom were seriously injured.  
While it’s a dangerous game to generalize any sect’s religious beliefs, at least a portion of the Toldot Aharon community—just like the Arab contingent that insists on the continued presence of “al-naqba” in school textbooks—considers the State of Israel an abomination, a presumptuous violation of God’s promise to recreate the Jewish kingdom with the coming of the messiah. 
In much the same way that it funded—until now, that is—Arab schools that continued indoctrinating their students with subtle hatred for the state, the Israeli government, with generous subsidies, essentially pays for the rioting Toldot Aharon members of the Eda Haredim community as they perpetuate their own forms of hatred and, ultimately, disloyalty to the state. In just this month alone, they have protested, with the same stone-throwing intensity, the installation of a municipal parking lot near Jerusalem’s tourist-heavy Old City that would remain open on the Sabbath; in late June they protested (albeit much more peacefully than they have in years past) the city’s annual gay-pride parade. 
In the sense that they have repeatedly opposed Israel’s right to administer its laws in its own land with a startling amount of violence, the Toldot Aharon rioters are hardly different from those Arabs who would characterize the state’s creation as a “catastrophe.” When it comes down to the question of “loyalty,” or, rather, lack thereof, one might think that the Israeli government would show each group the same iron fist. 
But that’s hardly been the case. 
The government was quick and wise to remove “al-naqba” from the textbooks, but it did nothing other than temporarily suspend Jerusalem buses from running through the rioter’s own neighborhood. 
If the Israeli government doesn’t begin to show an even-hand to all those who harbor the same destructive disloyalty to the State of Israel—Arab and Jew alike—the traditional Arab perception of a double standard in Israeli domestic affairs may no longer be unfounded. This is perhaps the greatest tragedy of all. 
In that sense, if the Israeli authorities continue to allow the Toldot Aharon sect and other anti-Zionist groups the freedom to disrespect the state at will, it might make more sense to just put “al-naqba” back in the books.

Defendant Joel Tenenbaum was dealt a blow in the second-ever jury trial on file-sharing on Monday when Judge Nancy Gertner ruled against the unusual strategy his legal team had planned to use.
Tenenbaum, a 25-year-old graduate student at Boston University, stands accused of illegally downloading 30 music files using Kazaa. Under the 1999 Digital Theft Deterrence Act, he faces maximum penalties of $150,000 damages per file, or $4.5 million total, if found guilty.
Led by Harvard Law School professor Charles R. Nesson '60, Tenenbaum's lawyers had said they would argue that downloading songs for non-commercial purposes constituted "fair use" of copyrighted material. If so, the plaintiffs--several large recording companies including Sony and Warner Bros--would not be justified in claiming millions in damages.
Such a defense, if successful, would have also introduced a novel meaning of copyright law as it applies to digital media. Nesson's argument, Gertner said, would have legalized any downloading of copyrighted material so long as it was used for a person's private enjoyment.
Though she dismissed Tenenbaum's defense, calling it "so broad that it would swallow the copyright protections that Congress has created," Gertner acknowledged situations in which downloading copyrighted files might fall under fair use.
For instance, Gertner said, an individual who deleted the files after "sampling" them or created them from previously purchased CDs to free up physical storage space might be able to argue fair use. And a defendant who shared copyrighted files during a period of time before there existed clear file-sharing laws and legal, fee-based sources of online music would present a "strong case" for fair use.
Debbie Rosenbaum, a joint Law School and Business School student who is participating in Tenenbaum's defense, said that she and Nesson were disappointed that they would not be able to frame the case in the terms of "fair use."
"There genuinely is some merit in the argument," Rosenbaum said, even while acknowledging that others may have found it "alternative" and "non-traditional."
Since Gertner has closed off this avenue of argument, a verdict of not guilty is "unlikely," she said, given that Tenenbaum has all but admitted to the act of downloading copyrighted material. Instead, their goal will be to convince the jury to minimize any damages Tenenbaum must pay.
"The plan moving forward is mostly to focus on the policy arguments—that what the music industry is doing to individuals is unfair," Rosenbaum said.
In previous court filings related to Tenenbaum's case, Nesson has argued that the Digital Theft Deterrence Act is essentially a criminal statute, and consequently the large damages awarded—significantly more than the cost of legally downloading a song—violate the 5th and 8th Amendments.
Gertner criticized the size of the damages sought by the recording industry last fall in a separate case.
"[C]ounsel representing the record companies have an ethical obligation to fully understand that they are fighting people without lawyers...that the formalities of this are basically bankrupting people, and it's terribly critical that you stop it," she said to the plaintiff at the time.
Most of the 30,000 defendants charged with illegal downloading during a five-year litigation campaign by the recording industry  settle for between $3,000 and $12,000. In the only other file-sharing case to go to trial, the defendant was ordered to pay $1.92 million in damages for downloading 24 songs, or $80,000 per song.
Tenenbaum is expected to testify in his own defense tomorrow or Thursday at the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and the presentations from both plaintiff and defense are on track to end by Friday.
