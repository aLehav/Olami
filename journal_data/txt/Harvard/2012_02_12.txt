After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He is not even an official candidate yet, but Joseph P. Kennedy III has a two-to-one lead over his closest would-be opponent in the race for the Massachusetts Fourth District Congressional seat, a poll released Thursday showed.
A poll of 408 Fourth District residents conducted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell and the Boston Herald showed Kennedy well ahead of leading Republican candidate Sean Bielat. Pundits said that the 30-point margin of Kennedy’s lead was larger than expected, but the poll’s results came as little surprise.
“I think it was sort of predictable,” Republican consultant Todd Domke said. “Maybe a little higher number than what might be expected, but he certainly was the presumed Democratic favorite. It’s a question of whether he’ll live up to the expectations.”
Kennedy emerged as the Democratic frontrunner in January when he announced that he would be leaving his post at the Middlesex Country District Attorney’s Office to explore a possible bid for the Congressional seat held by retiring Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62.
Kennedy’s chief Democratic opponent, Boston City Councillor Michael P. Ross, disbanded his own exploratory committee two weeks ago, leaving Attleboro consultant Paul Heroux as Kennedy’s only prospective party rival.
Political analysts have suggested from the start that the 31-year-old Kennedy will garner support based on his family name. Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and the son of former Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.
The poll numbers released on Thursday show 73 percent of voters view the Kennedy family favorably. About half of polled voters said the family has the right amount of influence in the state, and roughly a third said they believe the Kennedys have too much sway.
“Here’s a young Kennedy without a scandal who seems nice and reasonable and intelligent, and they don’t care that he doesn’t have the usual qualifications and experiences,” Domke said. “They are willing to vote for the monarchy. The Kennedy family has a mythology with a lot of Democratic voters.”
Whether or not such name recognition and support will translate into votes over a Republican candidate come November is still uncertain, Domke said, but it will likely earn Kennedy his party’s nomination.
“What Kennedy has to do is run on something other than his name,” Democratic consultant Daniel Payne said. “He has to make sure he’s championing two or three issues.”
While Kennedy has quickly emerged as his party’s likely nominee, analysts said Bielat’s bid for his party’s nomination will be more difficult. Elizabeth Childs, a Brookline physician and former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, has also launched a campaign to retake the longtime Democratic Congressional seat.
Bielat ran against Frank in 2010 and lost by 10.5 points. But the poll released Friday showed that 55 percent of voters in the district have not even heard of him.
“Last time he ran against Barney Frank he was a young, fresh face when voters wanted change—and he didn’t succeed,” Payne said. “This time, he’s not so young and he’s not so fresh.”
Kennedy, Bielat, Childs, and Heroux all hold Harvard graduate degrees.
The poll also asked candidates to rate the favorability of Sen. Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, who are vying for a Massachusetts seat in the U.S. Senate. Fifty-three percent of voters said they have a favorable view of Brown, while only 36 said they saw Warren favorably. Twenty-nine percent of voters said they had never heard of Warren.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Male students, faculty, and visitors to the Law School’s new Wasserstein Hall will have the opportunity to use the newly christened “Falik Men’s Room”—a cleverly named restroom bequeathed by Harvard Law School graduate William A. Falik.
Falik donated $100,000 to the Law School to establish a public interest law fellowship in honor of his father’s centennial birthday. The Law School named the restroom in his honor.
Several years ago, Falik met with then-Dean of the Law School Elena Kagan to discuss the donation and naming opportunities.
Falik said that he told Kagan that “the only thing I've ever been able to name with a name like Falik is a restroom,” and that he would be interested in the possibility of naming one in Wasserstein Hall, which opened its doors this winter.
According to Falik, Kagan was receptive to the idea and “she essentially said something to the effect, ‘sounds good to me, let me check it out.’”
Falik has previously sprinkled his name on another restroom. At the University of California Berkeley, where Falik currently teaches law, Falik created a public interest law fellowship and sponsored a restroom in Berkeley’s Boalt Hall.
Before that, Falik had made a donation to Berkeley Repertory's Roda Theater while serving on their board and helped to plan the creation of the Falik Gentlemen's Lounge.
"That was the beginning of this series of men's rooms, and I think I have now ended it," Falik said. "This is my hat trick."
According to Falik, his restrooms often receive more attention from the press than the fellowships he has created.
"The men's room has obviously more attraction to them in sort of the irony of the name Falik adjacent to a men's room, but some people have talked to me about the scholarship, and that's really what this whole thing's about." Falik said.
Falik said that naming a public interest law fellowship after his father seemed like a natural choice.
At his father's 100th birthday celebration, Falik presented his father with plaques from Elena Kagan and Dean of Berkeley School of Law Christopher F. Edley, Jr.
"He was just deeply moved by it, and he also got a great laugh out of the naming of men's rooms," Falik said. "My dad lived that long—he lived to 102—because he had a great sense of humor."

CORRECTION: February 12, 2012.
An earlier version of this article said that William A. Falik sponsored a restroom at Harvard Law School. In fact, the Law School named the restroom in honor of Falik, who donated $100,000 to establish a fellowship at the Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 12, 2012, at 3:04 p.m.
Members of the Occupy Harvard movement parked themselves in Lamont Library Café on Sunday night, pledging to stay in the café until 10 p.m. on Friday in order to protest planned staff reductions in Harvard libraries.
More than 23 supporters of the movement gathered in the café to inaugurate the next phase of their protest, the first to involve a physical occupation since Harvard administrators removed the Occupy Harvard dome from the Yard on Jan. 13.
An undergraduate café employee called the Harvard University Police Department to report the protest, according to an email to café workers obtained by The Crimson.
Police officers arrived on the scene and asked the protesters to remove the banners and signs that they had hung in the café’s windows, according to protester Andrew J. Pope, a doctoral student in history
“Harvard’s free speech policy protects students’ rights to express themselves on campus,” Pope said.
Pope said that a night supervisor employed by the library told HUPD that the staff supports Occupy Lamont and that the protesters’ actions did not break any library rules.
HUPD could not be reached for comment on Sunday night.
“I hope it makes people aware that the Occupy movement is ongoing, and it’s building toward the future,” said Rudi Batzell, a doctoral student in history. “I think that the location [of the occupation] here is important, especially with ongoing library restructuring. It’s a show of solidarity with the library staff.”
On Sunday, Occupy Harvard also hosted an Occupy Boston Student Summit in Emerson Hall, which was attended by over 80 students from 18 campuses in the Boston area. In Lamont, occupiers chatted with summit attendees by Skype.
Protesters say that the purpose of the new occupation, which they call the “New Harvard Library Occupation,” aligns with the goals of the national Occupy movement that began in September.
“It’s a different movement, but a continuation of the same ideals,” Pope said.
Batzell added, “I hope that it will raise awareness that the Occupy movement is alive and growing. I hope it will connect the local struggle of library layoffs to larger issues of inequality and workers rights globally.”
Protesters said they will give out candy, offer tutoring services, and host twice-daily think tanks to include other Harvard students in their activism efforts.
“The hope is to build relationships with the broader Harvard community, including undergrads and workers, and engage with them in different ways,” Pope said.
Students plan to continue the occupation until Lamont Library, which is open 24 hours a day on weekdays, closes at 10 p.m. at the end of the week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The annual Rookie-Sophomore Challenge at the NBA All-Star Game has a new format this year: Teams will be selected by former superstars Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal from a pre-selected group of first and second-year players. With “Linsanity” sweeping the nation, it seems certain that Jeremy Lin ’10 should be one of the first guards picked—but there’s a problem. The Harvard alum wasn’t chosen as a candidate for the game, and, therefore, cannot be selected to play for either team.
As Lin has continued to set record after record this week, the snub seems a bit unfair, at least according to Cheng Ho ’10. Ho, just hours after Lin and his New York Knicks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, created a Facebook event in the hopes of convincing the league to let Lin in on the game.
With less than two weeks left until All-Star Weekend, Ho is pulling out all the stops to get his former classmate into the anticipated frosh-soph matchup.
“If you think J Lin has earned and deserved an invitation, join this event, voice your support, and let’s get him a spot on the squad!” Ho wrote on the event page. “While the roster has been solidified, it’s never too late to try. Together. We have a good chance. J Lin never gave up. We will not either!”
Though it will take work and would be unconventional to add to a solidified roster, it could happen. After all, if we’ve learned anything this week, it would be that nothing is Linpossible.

Prefrosh and hosts, rejoice. Gone are the days of prospective freshmen awkwardly loitering in the Yard, waiting for someone to swipe them into their hosts' dorms throughout the weekend of Visitas.
According to Co-Chair of the Undergraduate Admissions Council Ayse Baybars '12, who is also a Crimson editorial writer, prospective freshmen will now have swipe access to the dormitories they are staying in during Visitas. Baybars said she is unsure if prefrosh will have access to other buildings during the weekend, as the decision has not yet been made. Baybars said the Admissions Office and the UAC have been seeking to obtain swipe access for prefrosh for the past few years.
 
Member of the UAC Timothy G. Seery '15 said he thought prefrosh would benefit from this greater independence. "They can actually live as a Harvard student for that weekend and not be so reliant on their host," Seery said. 
 
Visitas will take place from April 21 to 23.

It is time to tell Al Gore '69 that there is nothing inconvenient about this weather.
According to a recent CNN article, this January was the fourth warmest in the last 117 years.
January is typically the coolest month in Boston, with an average temperature of 29 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Weather Channel.
However, for most of the month, the temperatures ranged from the upper thirties to low fifties. Throughout this entire season, Boston only managed about seven inches of snow, in stark contrast to the more than 80 inches of snow that covered the area last winter.
But not everywhere in the United States has been as lucky as Massachusetts. Texas reported the 11th wettest winter on record.
And Alaska? According to the weather channel, some places, like Fairbanks, hit temperatures of 45 degrees Fahrenheit…below zero. Many cities in Alaska had their coldest months on record, and some received over 15 feet of snow.
These extreme temperatures may be misleading current freshmen, setting them up for a cruel awakening over the next few years. But hey, if it means that we could tan outside in January, why question a good thing?
Note: The author takes no responsibility for jinxing the winter weather. The frigid temperatures of Feb. 12 were by no means the result of this article.
