After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 21, 2015, at 3:19 a.m.
BOSTON—Assistant Harvard Medical School professor Michael J. Davidson, the victim of a shooting Tuesday morning at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, has died, according to Boston Police.
Davidson, identified as Tuesday’s shooting victim in a press release that evening, was shot at least twice on the second floor of the hospital’s Shapiro building. Boston Police have identified the suspected shooter as Stephen Pasceri, 55, of Millbury, Mass., who died Tuesday from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gun wound.
Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon that authorities believe the suspect targeted the doctor—later identified as Davidson—but that they do not believe the suspect was Davidson’s patient.
“[The investigation] is leading us to believe that there’s something in the past that upset [the suspect],” Evans said shortly after 1 p.m., when Davidson was still in critical condition.
According to Evans, Boston Police received multiple phone calls shortly after 11 a.m. “about possible shots being fired” at the hospital. Police then received a call of a “doctor being shot and people barricading themselves inside offices here,” Evans said.
Boston Police officers soon arrived at the scene and proceeded to secure the second floor, the reported site of the gunshots, according to Evans. They found the suspect—later identified as Pasceri in a press release Tuesday evening—dead in an examination room from what Evans said appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound with a weapon next to him.
According to Evans, the suspect entered the hospital on the second floor and asked for Davidson specifically. Evans said he believes the shooting occurred near the entrance to the examination room and lobby area.
“Clearly [Pasceri] came in, and the doctor came out to see him, and that’s [when] we believe the altercation took place,” Evans said.
Police secured the scene within 16 minutes, and there were no other injuries, according to a department press release. Evans praised the first responders, who he said “did everything they could to to neutralize not only the situation but also get the care to that doctor.”
Davidson was an assistant professor of surgery at the Medical School and was the director of endovascular cardiac surgery at the Brigham, according to his profile on the hospital’s website. Davidson completed both his residency in surgery and a fellowship in endovascular surgery and cardiac catheterization at the Brigham.
"The thoughts of the entire Harvard community go out today to the family and friends of Dr. Davidson, and to everyone at Brigham and Women's Hospital,” Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday evening. “Dr. Davidson was known as an exceptionally skilled, thoughtful, and compassionate surgeon, whose tireless efforts reflected his deep dedication to his patients. It is for these qualities that he should be remembered.  May they continue to inspire us as we mourn his tragic loss."
The shooting disrupted a busy day at the Brigham on Tuesday as visitors and hospital personnel evacuated the building.
James Pittelli of Stony Creek, N.Y., said he was already under stress when he arrived at the hospital Tuesday morning for his son’s heart surgery. He was in the second floor waiting area when a security guard entered and urged him to evacuate.  “I think people kind of thought it was a fire drill or a fire alarm...but then more people came in and started yelling, ‘You gotta get out, you gotta get out of the building now,’” he said. His son is safe, Pittelli said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days after opening the spring season with a pair of wins over William & Mary and Marist, the Harvard men’s tennis team returned to action by dispatching Dartmouth (2-0) in an exhibition match at the Murr Center. Five of six singles players earned victories as the Crimson (2-0) rolled to a 5-2 win despite dropping the doubles points.
“It’s always nice to come up with a win against another Ivy team,” co-captain Denis Nguyen said. “All of us took it pretty seriously. With that in mind, there was no weight to the match, but it was nice to come away with the win.”
Co-captain Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kenny Tao ruled the day as the pair picked up a doubles win together in addition to individual singles wins.
“Today was a good chance for us to practice some last things before the real season gets underway,” Steinroeder said. “Dartmouth is always a great team, so it was fun to get a chance to scrimmage them.”
The gutsiest match of the day belonged to sophomore Brian Yeung, who came from behind to win in the fifth position. After losing the first set 4-6, Yeung battled back to force a 10-point tiebreaker, which he took, 10-8.
The back-and-forth drama of Yeung’s match was more the aberration than the norm for Harvard. Aside from Yeung and junior Nicky Hu, who fell in a tiebreaker, all singles matches counting towards the final score went to the Crimson in straight sets.
Nguyen led the bunch with a dominant 6-2, 6-1 performance against the top player for the Big Green. Three games into the season, Harvard’s co-captain boasts a No. 57 national ranking.
“The strength of my game, I would say, is footwork,” Nguyen said. “Being a smaller guy, I need to be faster than the opposition, which is generally a little bit taller and a little bit stronger than me.... [Training over break gave] me a lot of confidence going back into the matches.”
Improved conditioning or not, Nguyen met more trouble when he and Yeung faced off against Dartmouth’s first doubles. The Crimson duo, which entered the season as the seventh-best pairing in the nation, suffered a 6-4 defeat.
Competing in the second doubles position, sophomore Sebastian Beltrame and Hu also lost, 6-4, to give the doubles points to the Big Green.
“[We] still need to figure out a couple things in doubles,” Steinroeder said. “Overall we were very happy with how everyone competed.”
Despite defeats at first and second doubles, Steinroeder and freshman Tao provided a bright lining by fighting for a 6-3 win.
Steinroeder and Tao also contributed singles points to the overall effort, winning 6-1, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-4, respectively.
The early success of the pair suggests that Harvard might have found something that it lacked last year: a consistent tandem at No. 3 doubles. However, Nguyen admitted that the doubles lineup was far from set.
“We’re still looking for our third doubles team,” Nguyen said. “That’s still a work in progress, as it was last year. It’s a little bit early in the season to tell who’s playing better…so it’s still a little bit of an experimentation process.”
In the singles lineup, senior Shaun Chaudhuri rounded out the squad with a 7-6, 6-2 triumph.
As an exhibition, the match against Dartmouth did not count towards either team’s final record. However, the Big Green and the Crimson will meet again at the tail end of Ancient Eight play.
Harvard entered the day with a No. 28 national ranking while Dartmouth came in at No. 47. The two teams are presently the highest-ranking members of the Ivy League.
“It was a very impressive showing on our team, and I was pretty happy with the performance,” Nguyen said. “[We need] perhaps a little bit more energy amongst team members, but we’ll probably ramp it up for our first real match.”
