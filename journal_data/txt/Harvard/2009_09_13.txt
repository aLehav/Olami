After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, President Obama gave a long overdue speech about his health-care reform goals. The speech helped clear up many uncertainties that have surfaced over the last couple of months around health-care reform. From tales of death panels to myths about covering illegal immigrants, rumors have spread among Americans and polarized the debate. Some have even come to fear reform and perceive the proposal as a government hijacking of their health. Therefore, we were pleased to hear Obama debunk these rumors and clearly articulate his vision for health-care reform.Obama assured us that no death panels will be created by a reform bill, that illegal immigrants would not receive coverage, that federal funds would not suddenly go to pay for abortions, and, finally, that the plan will not add a dime to the deficit. We admire his speech for its clarity on the issues and its firmness on the guiding principles of reform. Obama has made plain that he will not back down and that he will not accept a compromise that threatens the prospect of reform.We also admire the president for reaching across the aisle and making acceptable concessions in a serious attempt to rally bipartisan support for his vision. For example, he adopted a proposal to offer low-cost coverage to certain Americans with a pre-existing medical condition saying, “This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it’s a good idea now, and we should embrace it.”Moreover, Obama has shown flexibility regarding his desire for a public option and seemed ready to welcome new and constructive ideas. We urge Democrats to explore and consider all serious proposals that may arise, regardless of the inclusion of a public option. One such proposal, favored by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat, is to set up “co-ops” or non-governmental, consumer-owned entities to compete with private insurers rather than a government-administered insurance provider. Others, such as Maine Senator Olympia Snowe, a Republican, suggest implementing a “trigger option,” which would give insurance companies a window of time in which to implement reforms or else have a public option come into existence at the end of the window should they fail to meet certain benchmarks. Many other options are available, and we hope Democrats remain open to flexibility and give each alternative a fair consideration.Bipartisanship, however, can be a double-edged sword. Whereas some Republicans, like Snowe, are well intentioned and are sincerely working on health-care reform in order to better the bill, others, such as Iowa Senator Charles Grassley and Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi, are wasting the president’s time by negotiating in bad faith. It makes little sense to attempt to bargain with senators so far the right, as opposed to centrists like Snowe as was done during the debate over the stimulus package passed earlier in his term. Obama would be better served to seek consensus with more moderate Republicans like Snowe and her colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins. Another admirable aspect of the bill is the promise that it will not add to the deficit, but rather be funded by eliminating superfluous expenses in existing programs. Obama even proposed the idea of mandating spending cuts should projected savings not materialize. Current projections, however, suggest that reform would cost $900 billion over the next 10 years, and Obama’s speech did not delve into the specifics of how exactly he intended to pay for it. The president must clear up ambiguities on this matter in the near future if he is to command wider support.Overall, Obama made his vision clear, defended his principles, and gave hope to a brighter future in the world of health care. We hope that representatives of both parties work together in order to find the proper cure for a seriously ailing health-care system.

By now, it’s become almost inevitable: You go online, you try—really try—to read something worthwhile about the health-care debate, or Iran, or even something as innocuous as just how much money the famed photographer Annie Leibovitz actually owes. But then, inexplicably, you find yourself clicking through a slideshow about Michelle Obama’s summer wardrobe, and it all goes downhill from there. 
The reason that you end up browsing these pieces about the First Lady is not that you’re actually curious about what the woman wears or really about anything having to do with her. You just subconsciously select the easiest, flashiest item on the screen—and these are usually the ones about Michelle Obama. 
I would sound crazy if I claimed that there is therefore a giant media conspiracy to channel undue public attention onto the president’s otherwise normal wife. But I would sound even crazier if I said that I have seen all these pictures without having been forced to do so against my will. Call me crazy, but it seems clear that many major media organizations are doing their part to cast Michelle Obama in a certain mold, one into which she shouldn’t necessarily have to fit—the fashion maven and the cultural arbiter, the trendsetter and the globetrotter, the American queen and world icon.
In other words, another Jacqueline Kennedy.
The urge to compare the two women is natural enough, especially given that Barack Obama won the same sort of transformative, generational election in 2008 that John F. Kennedy ’40 won in 1960. Nor is Michelle Obama the first presidential spouse to be a media darling or even an object of national interest. Hillary Clinton, before her infamous health-care debacle in 1993, was similarly fawned over, and Nancy Reagan, with those ever-useful horoscopes, never failed to amuse. 
But while it’s always been a peculiar fact that the American people love and crave the same type of royalty their republic was created to reject, there is certainly something different about the way the media treats the current First Lady. Unlike Lady Bird, Pat, Betty, Rosalynn, Nancy, Barbara, Hillary, and Laura before her, Michelle is not just another political wife to be scrutinized excessively—she has been assigned the Jackie mystique, forced to represent the reincarnation of Camelot when she is in fact an emblem of an entirely different sort of era—our own.  
Frankly, Michelle Obama is not Jackie Kennedy. She was not born into the East Coast establishment, her blood does not run blue, and her upbringing was not centered on landing a powerful husband. She has a law degree from Harvard, out-earned her husband before he ran for public office, and has children and a family she still manages to care for. If First Ladies can be said to represent anything at all—and the judges are still out on that one—then Michelle Obama would seem to represent some version of the modern American woman, the woman who is fully engaged in each aspects of her life and who deserves a much broader definition than something as trivial as wardrobe alone, and a J.Crew wardrobe at that. Yet the media would have her transformed into another fashion icon or, as Vogue’s André Leon Talley said recently, “the most fashionable woman in America.”As if her fashion sense were the sole characteristic that defined her. 
I will not pretend that I alone know what “defines” Michelle Obama, but the point is that the media should present her as she is rather than paint her as some post-Camelot American queen. If we are still to be barraged with news about the First Lady—and I’m not sure we should be—then, instead of the outfits, let us see the truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’ve come to a pretty pass when the president of the United States is denounced for asking students to study hard. Sadly, the worst part is that it’s all completely expected. No one bats an eye.
To put it frankly, contemporary Americans generally don’t take kindly to hear public statements about responsibility, nor commitment, and we darn sure don’t want to hear them from those who hold a different political perspective. We have a listening problem. As a result, we’re not surprised when national outcries show the neurons of the public mind are set to send, but not receive.
On the whole, the president’s back-to-school speech on Tuesday was rather innocuous. It merely asked children to work hard, do their homework, pay attention in class, and wash their hands regularly. 
This is not to say there weren’t grounds for parents’ concerns—the language used by the Department of Education in the preparatory materials was not the wisest selection—but the speech wasn’t the grand oratory of progressive principles many conservatives feared. And it certainly wasn’t the Democratic equivalent of President Reagan’s 1988 back-to-school speech, which unabashedly preached the virtues of free enterprise, low taxes, and free trade.
President Obama’s speech was roughly equivalent to that of former President George H.W. Bush in 1991. Both speeches focused on themes of personal responsibility and controlling one’s own destiny. Few people seem to remember, however, that immediately after President Bush’s speech was given, a Democrat-controlled Congress ordered a General Accounting Office investigation, convened hearings, and summoned senior Bush officials to Capitol Hill to testify.
And so hyperbolic hullabaloo comes in both red and in blue. Too often, when Republicans speak on themes of responsibility, the Democrats become the free-living party. Too often, when Democrats speak on themes of responsibility, Republicans become the tea party. At some time or another, each party has shirked the obligation of being the party of obligation.
It’s worth noting Democrats and Republicans have different conceptions of how and why Americans should be responsible. And there’s no denying the strong strategic elements of spewing vitriol. But it all goes beyond both differences in philosophy and basic partisan politics. At the core, many Americans nowadays just don’t want to be told they are obligated to do something by different folks with different strokes.
Politics has been like this for probably all my generation’s time. My grandparents fondly tell me of an age when the political climate wasn’t characterized by hysterical soundbite-sized protests and “patriotic” bashing of public officials. Perhaps, once upon a time, such an erudite era did exist. In any case, I can’t speak to that part of the past.
But President Obama can. And he does. 
In the pages of his books and along the campaign trail, the president wasn’t shy about saying America is losing something that used to be omnipresent: A sense of mutual responsibility tied to sense of respect for those with a different view of what that mutual responsibility entails.
And yet the president is not a centrist or even necessarily an avid bipartisan. He is someone who displays faith in an old and quickly disappearing idea of the American political tradition: Negotiation on practices isn’t the same thing as selling out on principles, and listening is often more important than shouting. Most of all, he believes that rights comes with responsibilities. In this particular sense, the president is a conservative who reaches back beyond the days of populist conservatism. 
And so, ironically enough, a condemnation of the president for speaking about personal and civic responsibility to the nation’s public schools shows that not only do many Americans have problems with messages of responsibility from across the aisle, but also that the president’s message from a begotten time has fallen on many deaf ears.
Obama’s back-to-school speech was given to a future, healthy America from a hale part of the past. The current backlash only shows that the theme of simple responsibility must be emphasized even more.
Today, many Americans don’t want themselves or their children to be asked to do and be more by the president. But almost no one wants to continue to live irresponsibly and endanger the country for our posterity.
At the end of the day, we would all do well to think even more about responsibility and the lessons of commitment our American heritage has given us. We could all be—just a little more old school.

At the end of this month, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology will pull the plug on dial-up Internet, a fitting death knell for an outdated technology.  Though around 15 percent of Americans continue to use phone lines and chattering modems to bring e-mail and the World Wide Web into their homes, the era of dial-up is long gone. Its reign as the Internet conduit for the masses was, like most technologies in the Information Age, brief.
It is tempting to wax poetic about how dramatically the Internet has changed since the mid-1990s, when 28.8k was the standard, Web 2.0 marvels like YouTube and Gmail were hardly thought possible, and Facebook was just a gleam in Mark Zuckerberg’s pre-teen eye. Instead, we should reflect on how far we have to go, since complacent communications companies and outdated technologies still prevail.
The United States may have invented the Internet (although the credit doesn’t go to Al Gore), but our great nation recently ranked 28th in Internet connectivity according to a recent study by the Communications Workers of America. If that wasn’t enough, the study also claimed that the average Internet speed has only increased by about 30 percent in the last two years. This might seem like a big improvement on first glance, but really it’s far from noteworthy in an industry where things tend to double every two years.
The United States does have a significant geographic disadvantage when compared to tiny countries with faster networks, like Sweden or the Netherlands. Stringing high-speed access to rural areas is much easier when your entire country is the size of Illinois. But while a significant access gap exists between urban and rural America, even the fastest regions of the U.S. (the northern Atlantic states) can’t crack the 10 megabits per second mark. South Korea’s average connection speed is over twice that fast.
What are we doing wrong? European countries have been able to achieve faster speeds by forcing telephone companies to rent lines to local Internet service providers for use with broadband DSL. The Federal Communications Commission attempted to do the same during the middle of the decade to allow competition, but it had to back down from this practice after phone companies threatened to sue. Worse, the FCC and the courts allowed SBC to buy both AT&T and Bellsouth in 2005 and 2006, creating a huge monopoly that rivaled AT&T of the 1980s. Lack of competition in the U.S. broadband market has lead to huge profits for companies like Comcast and Verizon, making U.S. Internet not only slow but also among the most expensive in the world.
President Barack Obama has pledged to put broadband in every home through the use of tax credits. His plan stands in contrast to President George W. Bush’s deregulatory approach and harks back to the push to bring electricity and indoor plumbing to rural America in the mid-20th century. The goal is admirable, but may not yield much progress. Top ISPs have responded with a plan to simply redefine FCC’s definition broadband at a lower speed and introduce a three-tiered access system that could force consumers to pay more to receive the same connection speeds. Some providers have made efforts to provide bundled communications, which include telephone, television, and Internet, via fast fiber-optic cables in major cities, but rural Americans are still by and large left behind.
It is no surprise that market-only solutions have failed, because monopolies have little incentive to change, and the benefits of high-speed Internet are somewhat unclear to low-income Americans. The FCC and the courts need to stand up to the established telecommunications companies if they hope to put consumer and business interests first. 
Providing widespread Internet access that is both fast and affordable has benefits that extend far beyond creature comforts like downloading movies. A recent report from the World Bank Group found that a 10 percent increase in connection speeds is correlated with a 1.3 percent increase in economic growth. The faster the Internet becomes, the more purposes it can serve; high-speed Internet is the basis for many local IT businesses that generate jobs and exports. Expanding the high-speed Web to rural areas and increasing speeds in developed areas will also make long-distance learning easier and expand the possibilities of telemedicine.
Although the U.S. has demonstrably fallen behind in terms of Internet access, there is still time to catch up. A few years of good policy would create drastic improvement. Further, any claim that the U.S. is losing its edge is nonsense. A huge digital divide still exists between the industrialized countries in the West and East Asia and those of South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In India, for instance, only around 10 percent of the population has Internet access at all.
As Harvard students, we have even less to worry about. Those using the university’s wireless connection can expect a download rate of around 20 megabits per second when communicating within the country, according to an assessment  using speedtest.net. That is, unless you happen to be a FAS affiliate still connecting to the Harvard network using dial-up. In that case, I can only say: Your days are numbered.

In the midst of successful careers, four Harvard Business School alumni are preparing to return to campus as entrepreneurs-in-residence.
The school announced the appointment of the entrepreneurs, including former Yahoo! Inc. President Susan L. Decker, in a statement last week. The appointments represent a significant increase in the size of the six-year-old residency program, which has had only one annual participant in past years.
Venture capitalist Jeffrey J. Bussgang ’91, former industrial executive James M. Sharpe, and nonprofit and private equity specialist Jeffrey C. Walker will join Decker at HBS for the duration of the school year.
Michael J. Roberts, executive director of the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship at HBS, which organized the residencies, said the growth has increased the program’s breadth in response to varied student interests.
Roberts said that the increased number of residents has decreased the time demand for each resident, allowing more candidates to consider the positions. 
“It was hard for anyone to play this role while they were working,” he said. “By expanding, each person will be around less, but our entrepreneurs will touch a series of different bases.”
While in residence at the Business School, the entrepreneurs are expected to speak in classes and at various events. They will also work with professors and students, offering both intellectual discourse and career advice, according to Roberts.
Each of the entrepreneurs has a strong connection to the Business School. Several ran companies that were the subject of HBS case studies. In addition, Bussgang had been a HBS Business Plan Contest judge and Decker had served on an advisory board for HBS’s Silicon Valley research center. Roberts said that the Rock Center chose alumni  who have demonstrated an interest in both entrepreneurship and HBS.
In 2003, the Rock Center was established to support research and entrepreneurship among the student body. In recent years, entrepreneurship has been a growing focus at HBS, and all students are required to take a class on the subject. According to Roberts, by their 25-year reunion, more than half of HBS graduates have started their own businesses.
While none of the entrepreneurs-in-residence comes directly from a startup, Roberts says the experiences and expertise they bring will be valuable.—Staff writer William N. White can be reached at wwhite@fas.harvard.edu.

Former Dean of the Law School Elena Kagan—fresh from her first appearance before the Supreme Court—appeared before a rapturous crowd at the Law School on Friday where she described her recent experiences in Washington and was lauded by her HLS colleagues.Kagan, the current solicitor general, appeared on a panel with her successor as Dean, Martha L. Minow; Professor Charles Fried, a former Solicitor General under President Reagan; and Professor John F. Manning ’82, who worked in the solicitor general’s office in the early 1990s. Kagan’s Law School colleagues all praised her work and sought to use her government service as an example for HLS students about to enter the work-force.Kagan’s recent Supreme Court appearance—a benchmark for success for the nation’s top lawyers—was front and center in the panel discussion.Fried, himself a veteran of the Supreme Court, commended Kagan for her ability to give and take in argument and acknowledge difficulty in argument before the nation’s top legal minds.“Are you saying I was confused?” Kagan jokingly interjected.Kagan came to the Law School to describe her new position—calling it depoliticized and emphasizing the importance of trust between the solicitor general’s office and the Supreme Court.Though Friday’s panel sought to describe the merits and possibilities of government service, the audience—a packed crowd that trailed out the door and consisted mostly of students—hoped for an inside look at an administration with close personal and ideological ties with the North Yard.But Kagan revealed that she has no daily working relationship with President Obama and instead interacts on a more regular basis with the Attorney General.Still, Kagan’s ascension to one of the nation’s most prestigious legal positions—one that is often considered a stepping stone to a position on the Supreme Court—represents a return to power for HLS, whose largely liberal faculty had retreated from government during the Bush administration.One audience member asked Kagan what it was like to battle with Justice Antonin Scalia, referring to a tense moment during an argument before the Court on Wednesday.“Well, uh, he was wrong,” she said in the rather forced tone of a once free-spoken academic.—Staff writer Elias J.

Law Professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75 was successfully confirmed by the Senate on Thursday to be head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.As the Obama administration’s regulatory “czar,” Sunstein will be responsible for investigating the costs and benefits of the government’s regulatory policies, on issues ranging from financial services to environmental policy.“I feel honored, grateful, and humbled to be able to serve the country,” Sunstein wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson on Saturday.The 57-40 Senate vote fell predictably along partisan lines, with all but five Democrats who were present for the vote and only four Republicans voting in favor of his nomination.Conservatives aired concerns about Sunstein’s public statements as an academic, particularly his comments in favor of granting some legal rights to animals.But the nomination also drew concerns from liberals who criticized Sunstein’s advocacy of a “cost-benefit” approach to environmental legislation.Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.)—all from conservative or swing states—voted against the nomination, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted against the nomination.Law Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67, a colleague of Sunstein’s at the Law School, called Sunstein “a person whose judgments are typically quite balanced—sensitive to considerations offered on all ‘sides’ of an issue,” in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson.According to Tushnet, this year at HLS, visiting professor Michael P. Vandenbergh will teach Sunstein’s environmental law class, while various other faculty members in the field will cover his administrative law courses. There is no one, however, to teach the popular freshman seminar entitled “Extremism: Causes, Consequences, and Cures,” which Sunstein co-taught last fall with his wife, Harvard Kennedy School Professor Samantha Power. “It’s been the best class that I’ve taken,” said Anthony C. Hernandez ’12, who took the seminar last fall. “The best academic experience by far.” —Staff writer James K. McAuley can be reached at mcauley@fas.harvard.edu.

A dozen law enforcement and conflict resolution experts have been appointed to the Cambridge Review Committee tasked with analyzing the controversial July arrest of black Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., Cambridge officials announced last Thursday.The group’s members hail from across the country and include the dean of the Rutgers School of Law, the Philadelphia Police Commissioner, a United States District Court judge, a former FBI assistant director, and a U.S. State Department senior advisor who worked on Arab-Israeli negotiations.“This is a historic opportunity for the city to emerge as a stronger community,” said Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy in the press release. The committee will begin meeting in October to discuss its mission and goals, the announcement said, and will look to study police training, instruction, and operations; the racial, class, and interpersonal complexities of policing; and potential lessons from the Gates arrest that may be applicable to Cambridge and other communities.Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Washington D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum and chair of the panel, said that the Committee is expected to meet for three to five months before releasing a report. He praised the Committee’s “considerable experience” and said that the group would provide independent assessment and insight into the incident.Since announcing the formation of the Committee in July, city officials have stressed that the aim of the panel is not to compile an “action report” of the arrest, but to look at the incident more broadly and give recommendations for police when faced with similar situations in the future. Wexler said that Committee members will be reimbursed for traveling expenses but will not be paid.Gates was arrested at his Cambridge home in July for disorderly conduct after a passerby reported to police that two men—actually Gates and his car driver—had forced their way through Gates’ front door.While the charges were dropped soon thereafter, the arrest triggered national debates about race and sparked a media frenzy.—Staff writer Peter F.

A Saturday afternoon debate, organized by the Harvard College Vegetarian Society, featured a representative from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal. Students who were packed into a Science Center auditorium raised abstract objections founded in social contract theory to the PETA representative, instead of directly contesting the official’s arguments against eating meat.A heated exchange about the ethics of the food served by Harvard University Dining Services occurred between Bruce G. Friedrich, vice president of policy and government affairs for PETA, and Wesley N. Hopkin ’11, a member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society.Hopkin praised HUDS, saying that it is “moving in the right direction.”“We can, generally speaking, eat meat or eat meat products with a relatively clear conscience even now,” he said.Friedrich disagreed, noting that although HUDS buys eggs from cage-free farms, other aspects of its food procurement were still unethical. “Eating meat in HUDS when they are doing nothing for farmed animals, and eating meat in the real world, in any restaurant around here... is unethical,” he said.Friedrich argued that eating meat is bad for the environment, for the world’s poorest citizens, and for the conscious experiences of animals. “There really is no such thing as a meat-eating environmentalism,” he said. “And on that ground alone eating meat is unethical.”Instead of disputing Friedrich’s practical moral arguments, Hopkin and Harvard students in the audience asked questions that could have come from Social Studies 10 or “Justice”: How can we compare animal pain with human pain? And can animals be a part of the social contract?Hopkin conceded that today’s factory farming practices are “unconscionable, and should not be permitted.”But he questioned whether better farming techniques could ever create a world in which eating meat was ethical. Instead, Hopkin advocated an approach to animal rights that focused on the social contract instead of utilitarianism, and on leveraging consumer power to work for better farming practices instead of abstaining from eating meat.Friedrich, however, argued by using quotations from vegetarians ranging from Paul McCartney to Leo Tolstoy to Cameron Diaz—who compared eating bacon to “eating my niece.”During the question and answer session, audience members asked questions such as, “Is it ethically permissible to eat the meat leftovers of your friend sitting across the table at dinner?” and “Is it morally responsible to own a pet—or must you buy a bonzai tree?”Vegetarian Society co-president Jessica M. Luna ’10 said that she was thrilled by the large turnout and the substance of the debate.“It’s clear from both sides that no one likes factory farming,” Luna said.Jaymin Kim ’12 said that the debate changed her views of PETA for the better, but that she plans to continue eating meat. “I maintain that we should try to improve the current system, and not abstain totally,” she said. “Killing and eating animals is not completely unethical if done humanely.”—Staff writer Alex M. McLeese can be reached at amcleese@fas.harvard.edu.

The Office of Career Services has deemed Friday’s Career Forum and International Experience Fair a recession-time success, after 125 employers participated in the annual event, a 36-percent increase over the previous recession in 2002, according to OCS assistant director Deborah Carroll.This year, OCS combined the traditional job fair with the study abroad-focused International Experience Fair, which drew an additional 55 organizations, some of which offered employment opportunities to graduating seniors and graduate students who are poised to enter the job market during the worst economic recession since the 1930s.The Career Forum typically kicks off a frenetic fall e-recruiting season designed to stream line the job search process by staggering dozens of information sessions, resume drop deadlines, and interview prep sessions within the first few weeks of school.“It’s a good first step,” said Ingrid G. Akerlind ’10 of the fair. “It’s definitely more personal than e-recruiting.”The ongoing effort to diversify the fair has been aided in recent years by the absence of major banks like Goldman Sachs, and the now defunct Lehman Brothers. A sea of bodies, clad in dress-for-success garb navigated the five industry “neighborhoods,” including representatives from “science and tech,” “marketing, media, retail, and entertainment,” and “government, nonprofit, and education.”OCS Director Robin Mount said she was “thrilled” with the number of employers who registered this year despite the recession.“Harvard students are smart, great at communicating, and many have quantitative skills,” Mount said. “We just feel like it’s a great time to be Harvard. We heard from a lot of companies that Harvard is their top target school.”According to Mount, the Fair’s success can also be linked to the presence of new recruiters including Knight Capital Group, Anheuser-Busch, Major League Baseball, and the National Basketball Association.David W. Kunst ’07, a recruiter for the financial services company Raymond James, said that he noticed more non-traditional public service tables this year than when he attended the fair two years ago as a recruiter.And Mount said the recession market may also favor underclassmen and graduating seniors who are competing for the more widely-available entry-level jobs, rather than mid-level positions.The fair generates revenue for OCS, which will use the money to help support fall programming.—Staff writer Danielle J.

Finn M.W. Caspersen, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a prolific philanthropist who raised and donated huge sums to the Law School, died last week of an apparently self-inflicted gun-shot wound.Caspersen, the former Chairman of the Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance corporation, donated over $30 million to the Law School and served as the chairman of the successful capital campaign which ended last year and raised $476 million, the most successful fund-raising campaign in the history of legal education.Caspersen’s death comes at a time when his fund-raising abilities may have been most needed for the Law School when academic institutions around the country are facing challenges in raising funds.Law School Professor Charles Fried, who holds an endowed professorship, lamented Caspersen’s passing in an e-mail statement to The Crimson and said he “appreciated his warm and engaged generosity to Harvard Law School and its work.”Even after his death, Caspersen’s presence will continue to be felt in the North Yard. Two endowed professorships in Caspersen’s and his corporation’s name remain. The Northwest Corner Building, an ambitious building project which he helped fund, will contain a wing named after him. In addition, the room in Langdell Library that contains the School’s rare book and art collection bears his name.“Finn Caspersen once said that Harvard Law School challenged him to think, and he in turn became an extraordinary friend and supporter of the school and its mission,” Dean of the Law School Martha Minow said in a statement posted on the Law School’s Web site.Caspersen’s philanthropic activity extended well beyond Cambridge: he also donated to institutions such as the New Jersey prep school he attended, an equestrian center, and a rowing center.Though Caspersen came from a privileged background—taking over the helm of Beneficial from his father—his later life was marked by his philanthropic efforts, which he likened to a “second-career” upon his retirement, according to media reports.Caspersen passed away near his home in Rhode Island and is survived by his wife, Barbara, and four sons. He was 67.—Staff writer Elias J. Groll can be reached at egroll@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s tennis team picked up right where it left off last season. The 2009 Ivy League champions posted impressive results this weekend at the 17th annual William and Mary Invitational, sending two players—sophomore Holly Cao and freshman Hideko Tachibana—to the championship match in Flight A Singles. “I’m really impressed with the way our team competed this weekend,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “We’re a week and a half into school and our freshmen were terrific. They come with a lot of new energy and it should be a great fall for everybody.”The Invitational, an individual tournament, hosted players from 11 colleges and separated play into several draws based on skill levels. In the Flight A singles draw, Tachibana defeated Cao, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, in the finals. The match was the culmination of a tremendous weekend for both players. Tachibana won her first match in three sets before disposing of her next two opponents by scores of 6-2, 6-4 and 7-5, 3-4, respectively. Though the first-year faced no ranked opponents over the weekend, she did defeat challengers who had beaten the No. 73 and No. 107 nationally-ranked collegiate players. On the other side of the draw, Cao opened the fall season with a 6-3, 6-4 win and then squashed third-seeded Yevgeniya Stupak 6-0, 6-1 in the quarterfinals. Stupak, from East Tennessee State University, was ranked No. 98 in the nation. In the semifinals, Cao dueled Michaela Kissel of Marshall, who was seeded first and ranked No. 36 nationally. After a long battle, Cao emerged with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory. “I really don’t know how to talk about my matches,” Cao said. “[The matches against ranked opponents] were tough matches obviously. I’m glad I came away with the win and that’s all that matters.” In Flight B, junior captain Samantha Rosekrans won her first match but fell in the quarterfinals and in the consolation draw. Rosekrans will lead a young team this season that has no seniors and just two juniors on its roster.In the Flight C draw, freshman Kristin Norton cruised without dropping a set. She won her semifinal match 6-3, 6-2 and defeated Yassmine Alkema of Winthrop 6-0, 6-1 to take the championship. “I didn’t catch a lot of matches, but I think everyone performed well,” Cao said. “Especially the freshman—they stepped it up.”Also in Flight C, junior Agnes Sibilski went 0-2, losing to the fourth seed in the first-round and the eventual consolation draw winner in her next match. Another freshman, Sophie Chang, won the Flight D championship, downing Kristina Koprcina of Marshall in the finals 6-4, 6-2. In the semifinals, Koprcina ousted Harvard freshman Alex Lehman 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 to prevent an all-Crimson final. Overall, the Crimson dominated the singles draws, coming away with championships for Flight A, Flight C, and Flight D. “We had quite a few people make it to the finals, so we had a very strong tournament,” Green said. “I could tell by the way we were competing in practice that we were hungry and we were ready.”In doubles, Harvard did not fair well in Flight A. The team of Chang and Sibilski dropped two matches before rebounding with a 9-8 victory over a team from Maryland. The tandem of Norton and Rosekrans lost the first-round match but came away with an 8-4 victory against a fourth-seeded pair from East Tennessee State. Altogether, the two teams in the top flight went 3-5 in the three-day tournament. In Flight B, Cao and Lehman made a strong run to the finals winning matches with the scores of 9-7, 8-2, and 8-5. In the championship, a pair from Marshall defeated the two 9-7. “I feel like our singles was our strong point this weekend,” Green said. “Doubles was a little rusty...some kinks to work out. We’re going to work around with some combinations and see how things go.”The fall tennis season, which consists of several individual tournaments, is a precursor to the team season in the spring. The Crimson will to keep its momentum going this weekend at the Harvard Invitational. —Staff writer Jake I. Fisher can be reached at jifisher@fas.harvard.edu.

A number of distractions threatened to derail the Crimson, but Harvard field hockey didn’t bat an eye.Despite a vocal visiting fan section, some cases of swine flu and soggy conditions, nothing could dampen the Crimson’s home opener as the squad rolled to its third straight victory Saturday afternoon, taking down Bryant, 4-2, at Jordan Field.“I’m really proud of how the team stepped up and focused despite the weather,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “We also didn’t have a lot of subs this game because of injuries, and [a few players] are sick, but we came out focused on our game and everyone did a great job.”Harvard pressured the Bulldogs (1-3) early and rode a goal and assist each from Bannon and junior Chloe Keating en route to the team’s first 3-0 start since 2005, when the Crimson shut out its first four opponents.Adding to the difficult circumstances, Bryant fans from Rhode Island vastly outnumbered Harvard supporters in the stands, but it was the Crimson squad that showed energy early, netting a goal less than four minutes into the contest.Sophomore Allie Kimmel corralled a penalty corner feed from co-captain Kristin Bannon and left the ball for sophomore Georgia McGillivray, who buried Harvard’s first shot of the day from the top of the circle.The Crimson dominated on offense, outshooting the Bulldogs, 21-7, overall, and netting a 10-2 advantage on penalty corners.“We have worked on our corners every practice and it’s finally coming together,” Bannon said. “We’re beginning to gel…and it’s paying off. We’re getting a lot of shots on goal.”Harvard kept the game confined to the Bryant circle for much of the first half, but the Bulldogs managed to pull even on an unassisted goal from Elise Boissoneau. The forward received a well-timed pass from Alexandra Czerniak and fired a shot past Crimson freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos. Boissoneau’s first attempt hit off the left post, but she buried her own rebound at 25:41 to tie the score at 1.Although both squads followed with a number of missed chances—at times caused by misfires on the water-logged field—Harvard capitalized on its offensive onslaught, eventually wearing down Bryant goalie Kundayi Mawema.After Mawema turned away consecutive shots off of a penalty corner, the Crimson got a rebound opportunity of its own. Late in the first half, freshman Emma Keller sent in a shot that the Bulldog goalie kicked away, only to have rookie Katelin Wahl fire the ball back in. Mawema tried to smother the shot, but Harvard players descended on the goal mouth and managed to dislodge the ball. With Mawema on the ground, the ball rolled out to Bannon, who ripped it into the right corner for a 2-1 edge.With the lead in hand, the Crimson looked to put the Bulldogs away in the second half. To do so, the squad turned to Keating, its emerging star.After Mawema turned aside consecutive shots from McGillivray and Bannon in the 43rd minute, Keating made use of her quick hands, flipping the loose ball over the Bryant goalie’s shoulder and into the cage for her team-leading fifth goal of the season.“[Keating] has an eye for the net and loves to score,” Bannon said.With a two-goal cushion, Harvard ate away at the clock, stifling the Bulldogs for over 15 minutes behind the strong play of Tassopoulos. The rookie net-minder notched three saves and turned aside a number of other opportunities with athletic kick saves as she remained unbeaten as the Crimson goalie.“[Tassopoulos] has been great,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “Her communication is improving every game, which is critical for our defense and overall organization.”Despite a disadvantage in shots, Bryant cut the deficit to a goal with 11 minutes remaining. Czerniak set up another scoring chance by feeding Courtney Landi, who buried a shot in the left corner to make it 3-2.But Harvard did not appear rattled by the threat, as the squad continued to pressure the Bulldogs. Keller redirected a Keating shot from the top of the circle in the closing minutes to push the margin back to two and give the Crimson another decisive victory. In three contests, Harvard has outscored its opponents 12-4.“These three wins are giving us great momentum,” Goodman-Bacon said. “As the schedule starts to heat up, having wins behind us is crucial.”—Staff writer Max N.

Harvard men’s water polo notched a decisive first win, but the squad has work to do before league play begins.The Crimson (1-6) traveled to Princeton, N.J. for four contests in the Princeton Invitational, where it took its first contest against George Washington, 14-6, before dropping three straight to No. 11 Princeton, No. 16 Santa Clara, and Fordham. While Harvard did not always play up to expectations, junior co-captain Bret Voith addressed the importance of the team’s first win.“I would not say I’m satisfied, because we could have played better,” he said. “But it was great to get that first win in our first game [at the tournament].”The Crimson struggled in particular on the defensive side, yielding 52 goals over the weekend as it faced a number of talented opponents.“We have to work on our transition defense,” Voith explained. “We need to focus on getting pressure on the other team.”Despite Harvard’s struggles on the scoreboard, the team has confidence that it is moving in the right direction after showing more offensive versatility in its second week of competition.“We had a big, marked improvement from the prior weekend,” co-captain Egen Atkinson said.FORDHAM 11, HARVARD 8	The Crimson’s quest for vengeance against its Northern Division foe came up a bit short on Sunday afternoon.Voith completed a four-goal day with two scores and rookie Max Eliot also notched a pair, but Harvard could only muster a 1-7 in man-up situations, letting a number of key opportunities slip through its fingers.The Crimson received additional offensive support from juniors Jeff Lee and Alex Thompson and sophomore Luka Babic, as well as a strong showing in goal from junior Alexander Popp. Popp made 11 saves in his second start of the tournament.But Harvard was stung by a commanding performance from the Rams’ Ali Arat, who proved to be a single-handed force with seven scores.“I think we failed to adjust to [Fordham’s] style of offense,” Atkinson said. “They have one very dominant player and we didn’t do a good job of neutralizing him.”NO. 16 SANTA CLARA 18, HARVARD 6The Broncos came out strong and refused to let up on Sunday morning. The Crimson held Santa Clara to a 4-2 lead after the first quarter, but would never pull closer, as the Broncos demonstrated why they are ranked among the nation’s top 20 teams.“Against Santa Clara we were playing a very good team,” Atkinson said. “The team fought hard, but it wasn’t close.”Voith found the back of the net twice and Atkinson, Lee, Eliot, and sophomore Kevin DiSilvestro comprised the rest of the offense. Senior Nikhil Balaraman got his second start of the weekend for Harvard, but could do little to stop the Bronco onslaught.NO. 11 PRINCETON 16, HARVARD 8Balaraman was solid in his first contest of the weekend, posting 13 saves in Saturday’s nightcap, but the Crimson faltered against a strong Tigers squad. Princeton, which dropped its first game of the season to No. 4 UCLA earlier in the day, took advantage of Harvard’s struggling transition defense for a number of scores.On the offensive side for the Crimson, Atkinson led the way with a hat trick, capping a four-goal performance for the day. Voith and Thompson each added a pair of goals, while sophomore Mike Katzer completed Harvard’s best scoring day, notching a goal for five overall.HARVARD 12, GEORGE WASHINGTON 7The Crimson opened the tournament with its first victory of the season against its Southern Division rival. Since the Colonials defeated Harvard at the Eastern Championships two years ago, the squad had anticipated its chance for retribution—and capitalized on Saturday morning.After only eight minutes, the Crimson forged a 4-2 lead that it would never relinquish, relying on strong play from Popp in net. The sophomore logged eight saves and enjoyed for than enough offense from an energized Harvard squad.“The reason the [GW] game went well is that we were playing very team-oriented offense and defense,” Atkinson said. “Harvard water polo doesn’t live or die by one player…and playing as a team certainly helped.”Atkinson and his co-captain did not overlook a tremendous performance from Katzer, though, who paced the Crimson with a season-high four goals.“We had a couple of big performances,” Voith said. “Katzer gave our offense some firepower.”With two goals from Lee and Thompson and scores from four others, Harvard earned a crucial first win in 2009.—Staff writer Max N.

A weekend road trip to Texas provided no opportunity to rest for Harvard’s women’s volleyball team. Taking part in the Mizuno Invitational II at Rice University, Harvard (2-5) faced unyielding competition from South Carolina, Rice, and No. 23 Wichita State. The Crimson fell in each of the three contests, typically by slim margins in set-play.“The way that we played in some of those games was an affirmation that we can play with the best of the best,” sophomore Sandra Lynn Fryhofer said.Fryhofer posted impressive individual numbers in the Lone Star State, including a .458 attack against South Carolina—a personal record. The sophomore notched 28 kills over the weekend as well as five of the Crimson’s 14 blocks. At the conclusion of the tournament, Fryhofer was named to the all-tournament team. “Sandra Lynn is a really fast middle blocker,” senior Lily Durwood said. “She can find a kill even when it looks like there’s none to be found.”SOUTH CAROLINA 3, HARVARD 1Lining up against the Gamecocks (8-1), the Crimson won its first set of the weekend and came close to grabbing two others with sets of 25-21, 21-25, 25-22, 25-12. Although Harvard held substantial leads at various points throughout the match, the Gamecocks ultimately emerged the better team with a dominant performance in the fourth set.The challenge of playing the SEC team was clear to Durwood.“It’s a much faster pace of the game,” Durwood said. “We dug harder hit balls and played against bigger blockers. We’re playing at a higher level, I think. When we get back to our conference, we’ll be able to maintain that high level.” Excluding the final frame, in which South Carolina landed 16 kills while committing only one error, the two teams put forth similar offensive clips–the Crimson registered a .212 attack, compared to the Gamecocks’ .247  On defense, Harvard put forth a season-high nine blocks, relative to five from its opponent.Durwood dished out 37 assists and three kills, and sophomore libero Christine Wu made 26 digs. RICE 3, HARVARD 0The Crimson kept pace with the Owls (8-3) early on in the match and had the potential to take the first set with the score tied at 21. A pair of kills gave the Owls the lead, and although sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll responded with an attack of her own, Rice would not relinquish its advantage. The Owls’ Tracey Lam closed out the first set with an ace. A similar trend characterized the second set, with Rice breaking away late once again. Freshman Taylor Docter tallied three kills, and sophomore Christine Wu contributed an ace.The Crimson ran out of steam in the final set, allowing Rice to jump to a 6-0 lead out of the gate. The Owls utilized the early momentum to generate a 20-8 lead, and although Ingersoll, Fryhofer, and Wu spurred on a 4-0 run, Rice’s Ashleigh McCord put an end to any hopes of a comeback with back-to-back kills. The Owls eventually took the set, 25-15.No. 23 WICHITA STATE 3, HARVARD 0The weekend’s opening match with Wichita State (9-1) provided the Crimson with the season’s first glimpse of the big leagues. The site was intimidating.“Ivy League play is competitive, and there are some good hitters,” Fryhofer said. “But traditionally [Wichita State] has taller girls on their team and their defense is really scrappy. It puts the line on us, too. If we don’t take the opportunity to finish that point, then they’ll crush it down our throat.”Harvard’s encounter with Wichita State began and ended in a similar fashion. The Shockers threw out the initial ace on its first serve before sealing the deal with another two at the end of the third set. Wichita State’s serving skills plagued the Crimson all night—the Shockers tallied fourteen points on aces alone. Serving also hindered Wichita State, however, as the team’s 14 aces were nearly offset by 11 service errors.The Shockers were far from perfect while serving—the team’s 14 aces were accompanied by 11 service errors—but these faults were negligible. Relative to Harvard’s -.048 attack clip, Wichita State dominated on offense and hit .479 with 38 kills. Shocker Sarah McGee went into an offensive frenzy, knocking down 11 kills while generating an astounding .714 attack percentage. Wichita State posted nine blocks and refused to give one up to Crimson. Overcoming Harvard’s defense, the Shockers enabled themselves to go on numerous runs including an 8-0 streak towards the beginning of the final set.“It was a formative weekend for us,” Durwood said. “We faced adversity and had chances to come together to figure what was going wrong.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

Under the cold pound of autumn rain, the Crimson defied the odds, eking out a 1-0 victory over the visiting No. 14 Terriers of Boston University.The match raised Harvard’s record to 3-0, while delivering the Terriers their first loss of the season and dropping them to 2-1-1.But the matchup of cross-town rivals marked more than just an upset win. Harvard’s triumph over the Terriers also served as a measure of retribution against a team that had beaten the Crimson 5-1 in their last meeting.The 2009 edition of the two teams’ showdown was hardly the offensive battle it was a year ago. With a lone goal propelling Harvard to victory, the match was largely a war of attrition.A strong defensive effort by the Crimson’s back line ultimately gave Harvard the edge. Senior Kwaku Nyamekye, juniors Rob Millock and Jaren LaGreca, and sophomore Baba Omosegbon combined with sophomore goalie Austin Harms to shut down BU and bring home the win for the Crimson.“We were very solid on defense,” senior co-captain Andre Akpan said. “We gave [the Terriers] a couple of chances but nothing too serious—our back line was fantastic.”While BU out-shot Harvard 19-16, the Crimson defenders blocked eight attempts and Harms registered three saves. The Terriers’ defense, in contrast, only stopped two of Harvard’s shots.Offensively, the Crimson started out strong and largely controlled the ball in BU territory for the first half of the game. Despite pletny of opportunities on goal—such as a shot from senior Desmond Mitchell that went just wide and an Akpan header over the net—both teams remained scoreless as the clock wound down to halftime.Things began to heat up for Harvard in the 36th minute of play when two successive corner kicks finally helped the Crimson find the Terriers’ net. Senior Adam Rousmaniere drilled a corner to classmate Kwaku Nyamekye, whose shot was redirected out of bounds by BU goalkeeper Hrafn Davidsson.The next corner kick found sophomore Brian Rogers, who also battled Davidsson in front of the net. Harvard peppered the Terrier goal, but a deflected ball found sophomore Jamie Rees, who in turn found the back of the net, ending the stalmate.“It was a really gutsy effort,” said senior midfielder and co-captain Brian Grimm. “We battled, and once we got that one goal we were able to play as a unit and not let them score.”Going into the second half, Harvard’s one-goal advantage hardly guaranteed a victory for the Crimson. The Terriers rallied a strong offensive effort, reversing the possessions of the first half and keeping the ball almost solely on the Harvard side.“In a 1-0 game, it’s going to be hard, and you’re going to have to grind out victories,” Akpan said. “You get tired towards the second half, and you grind it out, and that’s what we did.”In the end, Harvard was able to counter the Terriers’ 16-shot second half, and came away with key non-conference victory early in the season.But for Grimm, this matchup was no more important than any other the Crimson has played.“Winning is always important, it doesn’t matter who the opponent is,” Grimm said. “Beating [BU] will give us some national recognition, but really it’s about winning every single game.”—Staff writer Alexandra J.

The Harvard men’s soccer team knew it should have been more than a goal up at halftime against Army. Despite dominating the first 45 minutes of play and forcing the Black Knight’s goalkeeper—senior Nick Alexander—into six first half saves, the Crimson (4-0) had failed to score the all-important second goal.“The guys were getting frustrated but I told them that we need to take pride in what we are good at—work rate and pressure,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said.“He really settled us down,” co-captain Andre Akpan said. “We had a different mindset going into the second half, wanting to be sharper and ready to pressure.”Clark also singled out Akpan, urging the senior striker to get on the score sheet.According to Clark, “[Akpan] came out ready to get some goals in the second half.”It did not take Akpan long to make his mark. Six minutes into the second half, Akpan picked the ball up on the edge of the box, shifted it to his right, and curled it into the right side of the net to give the Crimson a two-goal cushion.Harvard would go on to cap off a perfect weekend with an emphatic 4-0 win over Army (1-4) on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The victory should see Harvard enter the top 25 in the national rankings.The match could not have started any better for the Crimson. After just 30 seconds of play, co-captain Brian Grimm played a long ball to the left corner that managed to find senior winger Desmond Mitchell, who was darting down the sideline. Mitchell dribbled past the Black Knights’ defenders and knocked the ball into the net at the far post to open the scoring.“We were focused on coming out strong,” Mitchell said. “With our high-pressure mentality, it was a great way to start the game.”Mitchell spent the rest of the opening half tormenting the right side of the Army backline. The senior has started the season brightly after forcing his way into the starting lineup.“I’m always looking forward to taking on people on the outside,” Mitchell said.Despite creating chance after chance, Harvard was held scoreless for the rest of the period. While a one-goal lead is always somewhat tenuous, the Crimson defense looked completely comfortable, handling everything that the Black Knights threw at them with ease. Senior Kwaku Nyamekye embodied the controlled manner with which the Harvard back four operated.The game may have been all but over after the Crimson went up 2-0 in the 52nd minute, but Harvard was not finished.In the 62nd minute, senior Adam Rousmaniere sent the ball across goal from the right, and, after a Mitchell miss-kick, freshman forward Brian Rogers tapped home for his second goal of the season.The scoring was completed 12 minutes later, when Akpan grabbed his second goal of the match. Rogers held off two Army defenders on the edge of the box, laying the ball back to Akpan, who fired past Alexander.Akpan has now scored four goals in four games—a great start to his campaign to be named the nation’s top collegiate player.Harvard continued to create opportunities until the final whistle, taking a total of 35 shots over the course of the game.“Athletically, our attacking players separated themselves today,” Clark said. “In one v. one situations, they looked like they would come out on top every time.”Whereas Harvard was often skipping its midfield in the first half and trying to play the ball directly to Akpan, the second half saw the Crimson run everything through Grimm in the center.“If we can get the ball from Kwaku through Grimm to [Akpan], then I like our chances every time,” Clark said. “Usually it’s not as easy as it was today.”—Staff writer Jay M.

It was a difficult weekend for the Harvard’s women’s soccer team.After earning its first win of the season against New Hampshire on Sept 8, the Crimson entered this weekend with high hopes. But with Long Beach State handing Harvard its first loss of the season on Friday, and Hofstra holding the Crimson down 3-2 on Sunday, the celebration ended as quickly as it started.“It was a depressing game, definitely a difficult game,” said senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann after the Crimson’s 2-0 loss to the Long Beach State 49ers. “Each game we’re all learning lessons and building off of the mistakes of previous games.”Despite the disappointment, second-year Coach Ray Leone and the senior members of his team believe this past week has motivated the 2008 Ivy League Champions to perform on a higher level for the rest of the season.“The second half we had a lot of energy, a lot of excitement, a lot of chances,” Leone reflected on both games. “It’s taken us two and a half games to really see the real team. It’s going to come.” HOFSTRA 3, HARVARD 2 The Crimson showed new confidence on Sunday as the team went on the road to Hempstead, NY less than 48 hours after Friday’s disappointing final whistle.“Every game we are looking to bring this level, bring more intensity to our game, and I think Friday’s game we did a lot better in the second half,” said senior co-captain Gine Wideroff. “That was great for our confidence, we made long shots which is what we wanted going into [Sunday’s] game.” With 45 minutes of back-and-forth soccer, the score remained 0-0 going into half time, even with Harvard outshooting the Pride 6-2. As the second half began, Hofstra took a commanding lead with Salma Tarik and Danielle Murino each getting one past Mann.It was not until the final 10 minutes that the main excitement began. With 9:49 on the clock, freshman Caroline Albanese sent a volley into the left side of the net to bring the Crimson within one.Hofstra responded with a penalty kick, raising the score to 3-1. Only 58 seconds later, Harvard senior Lizzy Nichols sent a shot past Pride goalkeeper Krysten Farriella.“The last push that we made was probably the best that we’ve done this season so far,” Wideroff said. “It was good because we got a taste of our potential, and we are just hoping that from here on out we can be at that level from the beginning of the game, not just for the last ten minutes or even the second half.”What was especially exciting for Leone and the Crimson was the fact that Harvard finally managed to get a shot in the net, instead of relying solely on defense.“Sometimes when you are struggling to put it in the net, you just need to break through it,” Leone said. “We scored two goals in five minutes when we hadn’t scored three goals in 290 minutes, or even longer than that if you include the first half [of today’s game], so it was exciting.” LONG BEACH STATE 2, HARVARD 0 With the prospect of rain and strong winds across Ohiri Field, this was not the California weather that Long Beach State’s women’s soccer team was used to. But that did not stop the 49ers from handing Harvard its first home loss of the season Friday afternoon with a score of 2-0.While the Crimson attempted 5 shots on Long Beach goalkeeper Nicoline Jorgensen throughout the first half, the 49ers got the score rolling with a shot in the 37th minute off of a corner kick.Although Harvard picked up the aggression in the second half, taking 14 shots to Long Beach’s one, the 49ers managed another goal with a header from Shawna Golden 10 minutes into the second half.“We’ve played 4 games and only have got 3 goals, and that’s not going to get it done,” Leone said after the game. “We’ve really got to get that kind of focus now, because now we are defending very hard, we just need to add that attacking part of the game.”Defense was key in the game, especially with Long Beach’s unique way of surrounding the goal on all five corner kick oppotunities that they took in the first half.“I don’t know, I’ve never seen that before,” Harvard goalie Mann said. “I went to get the ball and obviously they can’t stand that close, it’s obstruction. It was difficult.”With Mann saving four goals throughout the game, Harvard’s defense proved an obstacle for Long Beach State, and hopes to continue to provide a challenge to local rivals Boston College and Boston University next weekend. And now that the Crimson has had its first taste of net in over a week, Harvard hopes to be offensively sound as well.“We haven’t practiced for a week and a half at least, so we need to get back to improve our technical defending, but the rest of it is starting to come along,” Leone said. “BC and BU are fantastic teams, so we have our hands full, but we’ll give it a go.”—Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

Most Harvard students eat meat. And most Americans probably think of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals as an extremist group.
You wouldn’t have known it at the debate the Harvard College Vegetarian Society organized this afternoon between Wesley N. Hopkin ’11, a social studies concentrator and member of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, and Bruce G. Friedrich, vice president of policy and government affairs for PETA.
The most heated dispute concerned our own Harvard University Dining Services. Hopkin praised HUDS: “They are moving in the right direction,” he said. “We can, generally speaking, eat meat or eat meat products with a relatively clear conscience even now.”
Friedrich responded sharply. He noted that HUDS buys eggs from cage-free farms, but said that is the only bright spot. “Eating meat in HUDS when they are doing nothing for farmed animals, and eating meat in the real world, in any restaurant around here,” he said, “for people here who said you do eat meat: that is unethical.” Get the skivvy on Hopkin's response and more after the jump.
Throughout most of the debate, though a slim majority of the packed Science Center audience admitted to eating meat, Hopkin conceded Friedrich’s arguments about the immorality of being a carnivore in today’s world. PETA seemed downright reasonable.
Hopkin and questioners from the audience rarely presented compelling reasons to dispute the main thrust of Friedrich’s well-supported argument. The PETA leader argued that facts overwhelmingly show that eating meat is bad for the environment, for the world's poorest, and for the conscious experiences of animals. Instead of disputing Friedrich's figures, Hopkin and others raised abstract intellectual questions heard in Social Studies 10 and “Justice”: How can we compare animal pain with human pain? And can animals be a part of the social contract?
Friedrich's argument, by contrast, was direct and sure of its moral clarity. Throughout the event, he peppered his arguments with colorful quotations from celebs and intellectuals alike:
From Paul McCartney: “It’s staggering when you think about it. Vegetarianism takes care of so many things in one shot: ecology, famine, cruelty.”
From Leo Tolstoy: “Vegetarianism is the root of humanitarianism.”
And from Cameron Diaz, on eating bacon: “It’s like eating my niece.”
Hopkin, the subtle debater, conceded that today's factory farming practices are "unconscionable, and should not be permitted." Instead, he wondered whether better farming techniques could ever create a world in which eating meat was ethical. He advocated an approach to animal rights that focused on the social contract instead of utilitarianism, and on leveraging consumer power to work for better farming practices instead of abstaining from eating meat.
During the question and answer session, Harvard’s lofty minds posed provocative questions:
Is it ethically permissible to eat the meat leftovers of your friend sitting across the table at dinner?
How anthropocentric is the social contract, after all?
Cuteness aside, can we kill kangaroos in the barren outback of Australia?
And: is it morally responsible to own a pet—or should you buy a bonzai tree?

Every house comes together in its own way. Pfoho, with its remote location, unpronounceable name, and endangered polar bear mascot, is a bit more conscious of its shortcomings than most (or so it seems to this chauvinistic Cabot cod). But its hardy residents, fresh off the shuttle, are happy to celebrate them.
An email the HoCo sent out over the house open to announce the second year of their newest tradition contains fully 10 instances of their ubiquitous “pf.” There are three “pfailure”s, followed by “pfun” and even “pflove." Why are these polar bears so emotional?
It’s pFML, or pFuck My Life—the Pfoho version of the popular blog “FMyLife: Get the guts to spill the beans.” More after the jump.
The blog that inspired the wall says it “is a space where you can let it all out and unwind by sharing the little things that screw with your day, and maybe realize that you are not alone in experiencing day to day crap.”
Pfoho’s version is a prominent swath of wall on the second floor of its dining hall. The HoCo’s message calls for students to “Pull out and iron out all of those job rejection letters and failed midterms wrinkled and inside your trashcan AND/OR think up all of your favorite recent pfail stories,” post them on the wall anonymously or signed, then “Smile & feel accomplished/cleansed” and finally “Read all the other posts and stop feeling like you are all alone in your troubles. Pfailure is pfun!!!”
The HoCo decided to divert a few dollars from stein club to purchase a healthy supply of notecards, pens, and tacks for students who want to post. Pfoho residents are confident it will fill up when midterms and job applications begin, but so far the results reveal mostly repression.
"I'm a virgin! pFML" wrote one poster. Another fantasized about a dreamy professor. And one student decided to write about finding poop in a shower (what would that mean to a creative psychoanalyst?).
Quelling any concerns for the awesomeness of we droppers of the H-bomb, two more confident posters showed the full range of Harvard swag. "I just got a BlackBerry last week. I dropped it in a garbage can on Saturday night. It's landed in a cup. The cup was half-full of beer. I no longer have a Blackberry," shared one conspicuous consumer. Another wouldn't have been impressed, and wrote in impeccable script (who needs to text?): "I love organic chemistry, and I don't mind that it has taken over my (social) life."
Though most of them have yet to open up, Pfoho residents seem to like their wall.
“I’m personally a fan of places where people write things on walls at 4 a.m. in the middle of an all-nighter,” said Pfoho resident Natalia I. Irizarry-Cole ’11. “It’s nice to know you’re not in it alone.”
When asked whether the wall would keep Harvard students from taking their failures seriously and learning from them as they should, new Pfoho resident Graham M. Frankel ’12 said that “we go to Harvard, and we end up internalizing failure and work hard regardless, and in the exact moment, it’s nice to laugh.”
Pfoho HoCo co-chair Laura Jaramillo ’10 said that the pFML wall is helpful because “in a really high stress environment, everyone needs an outlet.” She added that the wall makes the house closer: “Little things like that all help a feeling of community.”

Updated at 10:10 p.m.
A gas main under Plympton Street cracked early Sunday afternoon, causing gas to seep into Old Quincy and the building to be evacuated for several hours.
The gas concentration was low enough to not constitute a serious fire danger, according to officials at the scene, and the gas company, NSTAR, was present and actively monitoring gas levels soon after the leak was identified.
The gas began filtering into the building through cracks in its foundation during the early afternoon yesterday, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III. Outside Quincy on Plympton Street, the smell of gas was palpable throughout the afternoon.
Although gas levels inside the building were not of immediate concern, turning electric appliances on and off in the building could have caused a fire to break out, Murphy said, but with the building evacuated, that risk was minimized.
An NSTAR team excavated the gas main and plugged the leak by the evening.
According to witness reports, the leak likely started at around 1:30 or 2:00 p.m., but students were not officially informed of the situation until 3 p.m. Most students, instead, resorted to quizzing fire-fighters on the scene for information.
Harvard’s emergency messaging service remained silent throughout the afternoon.
At the time that the evacuation was ordered in Old Quincy, there was no smell of gas inside the building, said Andres D. Uribe ’12, who was inside when the alarm sounded. While gas in its pure form is odorless, it is odorized before delivery to households.
Gas levels in the basement of Old Quincy had begun to decrease by 3:30 p.m., Murphy said. The evacuation remained in place until 5 o’clock, when students were allowed to return to their rooms in Old Quincy.
But Murphy said he was surprised to find students in their rooms yesterday afternoon at all.
“Shouldn’t you be out partying on a day like this?” he asked.
Murphy added that this weekend’s “torrential” rains likely contributed to the leak, as the precipitation could have created sink-holes around the gas main, which had allowed the gas to escape from a pre-existing crack. The gas then likely followed the newly-installed water main that feeds Old Quincy’s sprinkler system into the building.
“The gas follows the path of least resistance,” Murphy said. “The soil around the recent excavation [for the water main] probably isn’t as compact as the surrounding soil.”
Despite the leak, the House’s Field Day celebrations and opening convocations continued in the Quincy courtyard.
Housemaster Deborah J. Gehrke, in full academic regalia, flourished the Quincy cane and admonished the gas leak that had threatened the ceremonies.
“I expunge this gas leak from Quincy.”
Correction included: An earlier version of this post stated that gas had  been turned off to Quincy House. In fact, Old Quincy does not have a direct gas supply. In addition, the main that supplies Quincy House is not the source of the leak, so it did not need to be turned off, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III.

UPDATE 9:45 p.m.
Investigators found a female body this evening inside a wall in the basement of the research facility where Yale graduate student Annie Le, 24, was last seen Tuesday morning, the Yale Daily News reports.
Officials could not confirm at this time whether the remains belonged to Le. An autopsy will be performed by the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the case is now considered a homicide investigation.
Just yesterday, investigators retrieved bloody clothes in the ceiling of the research facility yesterday, but have yet to establish a link to Le's disappearance, as she was wearing different clothes that morning. An unnamed source within the Yale Police Department said officials are currently analyzing the blood to determine its origins, as it could have been from animal blood from experiments conducted in the lab.
Le, a pharmacology doctoral student from Placerville, Calif. was last seen entering the university lab at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday. Roughly three hours later, an unexpected fire alarm sounded, and the building was quickly evacuated.
There is no record of her leaving the building in surveillance tapes from some 75 cameras stationed around the building. Her ID, money, credit cards, and purse were found in her office.
Le was to be married today to Columbia University graduate student Jonathan Widawsky at the North Ritz Club in Syosset, N.Y. The wedding was called off shortly after her disappearance, and Yale students prayed for Le’s safe return at The University Church earlier today.
Yale is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Le’s whereabouts.
Anyone with information pertaining to Le’s disappearance is asked to call the FBI tip line at 1-877-503-1950.
