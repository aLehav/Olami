After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-five years since its initial debut, the age of Aquarius dawned once more this weekend. That vivid bygone era—a time of easy drugs and hard moral choices, of love that comes free and liberty that comes at excruciating cost—took center stage at the Loeb Ex in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s exuberant production of “Hair.”
It is hard to overstate how shocking “Hair” must have seemed to its first audience in 1967. Opposition to the Vietnam War was only just beginning to gain a foothold in mainstream opinion, and hippie culture wasn’t history; it was happening. The musical depicts copious use of mind-altering drugs, breezy willingness to form sexual liaisons at the merest suggestion, and youthful irreverence toward conventional religious, educational, and parental authority. To see all of that, buoyantly set to rock music, must have been astonishing for Broadway audiences—even before the now-famous nude scene that ends the first act. (In the HRDC’s production, the lights were dimmed so that viewers could see that the actors were stripping and not much else.)
The modern resonance of the 45-year-old musical rang out in the HRDC’s rendition. “Hair”—which ran from April 26 to April 29—is a tale of young people, angry at the policies enacted in their nation’s capital and terrified of the consequences for their own lives, who take their frustration and fear, in all its earnestness and messiness and bitterness and hope, to the streets of New York. In the days of Occupy, the political undertones of this musical seem highly relevant once more, providing ample fodder for a boundlessly energetic cast to reanimate this cultural touchstone.
Director Katherine L. Price ’14 took pains to make sure that her modern audience felt as close to the hippies of “Hair” as possible, metaphorically and literally. Actors repeatedly leaped into the risers to tousle audience members’ locks, sit on their laps, or stroke them suggestively.
The young characters of “Hair” call themselves “the Tribe,” and Price’s staging emphasized the cohesiveness of this cohort. The actors, who spent the bulk of the show lounging in couples and occasional threesomes, gathered together at moments of heightened emotion to form a close pack of ardent activists. To reinforce the communal spirit of the show, Price even chose to forgo listing actors’ roles in the program, opting for an alphabetical list of cast members instead.
In a show so intensely focused on its ensemble, every actor must work to make the Tribe believable. The cast of “Hair” answered this challenge with aplomb. Springing through back-to-back musical numbers, the cast offered all the bouncing-off-the-walls energy, loosely coordinated but not precisely polished group dancing, beatific smiles, and wanton tosses of unrestrained hair that one might expect from a group of close friends with several powerful drugs in their systems.
In this spirited cast, Mark J. Mauriello ’15 stood out as the starry-eyed, impetuous high school dropout George Berger. He was supremely comfortable teasing audience members, spouting drug-fueled revelations, and belting out songs. In many of those numbers, he interacted touchingly with his friend Claude Bukowski (Phil M. Gillen ’13), whose torment over whether to burn his draft card or head off to Vietnam formed the play’s emotional core. Though Gillen seemed to struggle with the vocal requirements of the leading role, he stayed in character nonstop to give a moving and memorable performance as the cocky but conflicted young man.
Brianne Holland-Stergar ’13 offered some touching moments as Jeannie, who professes her love for Claude although she has been “knocked up by some crazy speed freak.” Many cast members—notably Kimberly A. Onah ’15 as Sheila, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 as Dionne, and Talia M. Fox ’13 as Crissy—provided the strong vocals necessary for a show so stuffed with music. Missed microphone cues meant that the opening lines of several songs were muffled, but actors and crew usually recovered quickly. The brassy accompaniment of the student band bolstered the upbeat tone of the show.
Set designers Madelynne A. Hays ’13 and Isabel Strauss ’13 nicely captured both the colorful mentality and the gritty reality of the Tribe’s lifestyle, with whimsical printed cloths draped over cardboard boxes and a vibrant sunrise painted on black-and-white anti-war posters. The hallmark of the multi-level set was a staircase painted like an American flag that lit up at key moments of the show. Rossi L. Walter ’14, Elisabeth A. Meyer ’15, and Aaron S. Graham-Horowitz ’15—who designed the show’s lighting—used color to great effect, especially during a hallucinogen trip depicted through shifting hues and a long dance by strobe light.
Faced with his summons to fight in Vietnam, Claude says plaintively, “I just want to be over here doing the things they’re over there defending.” By energetically depicting both the hippie movement’s gleeful abandon and its painful link to global tragedy, the cast of “Hair” presented a complex, compelling view of a tumultuous age. This production, perhaps, is a response to the anguished question that the Tribe found unanswerable when they received their draft cards: Crying out from their amorous hangout, they asked of an unresponsive government, “How dare they try to end this beauty?” “Hair” replied this weekend that, long after the devastating war has passed, the undimmed remnants of that unconventional beauty can still thrive onstage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the saying goes, creation is 10 percent inspiration and 90 percent perspiration. Tim Cawley would agree, and the independent filmmaker has recently completed a documentary that affirms the old adage. Cawley’s film “From Nothing, Something,” which premiered at the Somerville Theatre last night as a part of the Independent Film Festival Boston, illustrates that creativity is a laborious enterprise, a process about perseverance if it is about anything at all. The documentary explores some of the diverse forms creativity and the creative process can take, and it includes the testimonies of several Harvard faculty members and alumni. It was meant, Cawley says, to dispel the myth that creativity arises as a fully formed flash of genius.
Cawley admits that the film, his feature-length directorial debut, is not a definitive statement about creativity. He had hoped that it would be, he says, but making a movie on the subject proved a huge task. “It was like making a movie about breathing,” he says. “I had the complete audacity to go, ‘I’m going to make [a movie] about thinking things up.’” The film incorporates interviews with creative thinkers in a variety of vocations, from cancer researchers to a movie-creature designer, as Cawley hopes to show the importance of creativity in fields outside of, as well as within, the arts. “If I said to you, ‘What’s a creative person?’ you’d say an artist or a novelist. Those are the first major answers, and you’d be right,” Cawley says. “[But] I wanted to [cover] people who make things and are close to the product—that was essential to me.”
With “From Nothing, Something,” Cawley investigates the unromantic side of inspiration––failures and long hours spent pacing back and forth, contemplating the task, and waiting for the muse. “You learn by getting a little bit right and a bunch wrong,” Cawley says, pointing out the importance of the trial-and-error method in creative work.
Tom Perrotta, a novelist and former expository writing preceptor, emphasizes that the process demands commitment and drive. “Every artist has to go all in at some point. You think, ‘I’m doing this to save my life right now,’” he says in the film trailer.
Preston Scott Cohen, an architect and a professor at the Graduate School of Design who is featured in the film, stresses that creative work also should not be forced or excessively esoteric. In his projects, he says, he engages his creativity in breaking from convention only when he feels is needed. “I prefer to see [architecture] as necessary, yet I want things to happen that are strange.… I have to look for the reasons for things to become strange,” he says. “I am looking for a reason to create, to be creative.” He is especially inspired by the prospect of breaking free from the limitations of his medium. “I like the idea of doing something I can’t do; that’s the beginning for me,” he says.
Perrotta, like Cawley, expressed interest in how creativity produces a tangible result, how an imaginary construct can become a real product. “There’s this feeling of making a material object––in my case, a book––from immaterial agents,” he says. He added that writing a novel requires constantly solving one problem after another, and as a novel can take a long time to complete, Perrotta stressed the importance of getting satisfaction out of this process rather than anxiously anticipating the end product.
Having assembled so many perspectives on the act of creation, Cawley found that he himself drew inspiration from the film. “The fun thing of making a movie like this is [that] every time I hit an impasse, the answer was in the movie. The movie’s an instruction booklet on how to get the [project] done,” he says. He hopes that for others interested in creative work, his film will spark ideas or provide direction. “The best you can do is to get a bunch of people in a dark room, sit and watch this thing for 80 minutes, and have people walk out inspired [to] do something or feeling a little bit better about the madness they inflict on themselves, trying to make things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard prides itself on fostering a community-like atmosphere through the House system, with the aim of making students feel more at home.  While House life is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable elements of the Harvard experience, an undue reliance on the trustworthiness of this community can have negative consequences. One example of this sort of problem is the recent uptick in laptop thefts this month. Sixteen laptops have been reported stolen this April, twice as many as were reported missing in the month of March. In many cases these thefts seem to have been the result of not taking necessary precautions, as they have occurred in relatively public places.
College campuses are rife with laptops—almost every student owns one—a quality that makes these campuses, which often feel like safe communities, prime targets for those looking to capitalize on an abundant supply of a valuable good. Students should be cognizant of this unfortunate reality and take precautions against laptop theft. While one may feel that dining halls and libraries are safe places to momentarily leave a laptop unattended, these oft-frequented locations are actually quite conducive to burglary, and asking a friend across the dining hall to keep an eye on one’s computer is not an unassailable form of protection.
The rise of burglaries on campus should not make members of the Harvard community live in constant fear. On the contrary, Houses should do everything in their power to ensure that their residents feel safe in a community environment, but this sense of security should be augmented by an awareness that no community is perfect and precautions must be taken no matter how collegial the atmosphere. Students should be especially certain to maintain the security of their own rooms. Although the Houses are supposed to be student homes, a lot of people have keys to those homes, and the sense of comfort of these places has a tendency to create a false sense of security that is not representative of the actual dangers of communal living.
Since the Harvard University Police Department does not publicize its logs for more than sixty days, the minimum period allowed by law, there is no way to know whether April represents an anomaly or if it is part of some wider trend from merely visiting HUPD's website. Thus, while HUPD cannot possibly be responsible for making sure every laptop is accounted for at all times, they would better serve Harvard students if they were more transparent about criminal history on campus. After that, it is up to individual students to take care of their possessions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences have always been like a trio of squabbling siblings. Humanities are the entitled elder brother of the bunch who sees the Yard as his birthright and is confused as to why no one sees how generous he is in splitting the inheritance. Hard sciences are the quiet middle sister who keeps house and whom everyone overlooks until the prizes roll in. Social sciences are the flashy youngest sister, stealing from both her older siblings and calling herself the new and improved model. Now, engineering and the applied sciences have intruded, like visiting cousins who are tolerated until they suck up too much attention. The three siblings ask: How long are they going to stay?
The manifestation of this is tomorrow’s unnecessarily controversial faculty vote over new engineering majors. At last month’s faculty meeting, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences presented a proposal for two new undergraduate concentrations, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, and many humanities faculty members fought it as if they were defending the Alamo. “I worry that the size of the concentration is driven by the professional demands rather than the demands of the college,” said History Chair James T. Kloppenberg. “If a concentration that has 20 course requirements is structurally irreconcilable with a liberal arts education, which I think it arguably is, why create even more concentrations like these?” said German professor Peter J. Burgard.
Lest anyone mistake this for something it is not, this is an entirely symbolic battle. If faculty members were truly worried about students bearing an overly heavy course load, they would have made a fuss about it during the five years that engineering sciences itself has been a concentration. Getting a Bachelor of Science in the field already takes twenty credits and can be done with a mechanical or electrical engineering subspecialty. If they were truly worried about pre-professionalism, they would attack easy lecture-based courses with disengaged students like those in the economics and government departments. This tantrum is really about the humanities feeling marginalized by the University.
It is an open secret that humanities have had a rough past couple years at Harvard. Roughly half of the budget of FAS comes from endowment returns, so the humanities got burned when the endowment fell 30 percent in the financial crisis. To save money, Dean Michael D. Smith froze faculty hiring, which is still only moving at a trickle. FAS departments are furious at losing junior faculty to rival universities and are scared of losing intellectual virility as the tenured faculty ages. FAS administration also cut funding for regional centers and flat-lined budgets for smaller departments. And this fall, it went for the sacred cow—it slashed the budget of the library system.
In contrast, SEAS is thriving. Because Harvard’s professional schools set their own budgets and raise their own money, SEAS was able to survive the financial crisis better. It has a ten-year plan to hire 50 new faculty members. The end-of-term Computer Science 50 fair has everything but free pony rides, and this year Engineering Sciences 50 also got t-shirts. In February, President Drew G. Faust announced a $100,000 prize for Social Innovation—sponsored by what is effectively engineering’s entrepreneurial arm, the Innovation Lab. On top of this, the sciences in general will dominate Harvard’s land grab in Allston.
The humanities have also been on the defensive ideologically. The academic environment of Harvard seems to be shifting toward the practical, as shown by the new General Education curriculum, new secondary fields in health policy and possibly social change, and increasing power of the business, public health, and education schools.
But SEAS is not like other professional schools. Although engineering is practical, it is also intellectual. To reject this is to cling to an antiquated view of education that sells short the “liberal arts” idea. Engineering is a cognitive framework worth exploring independent of careerism. Its students do not necessarily plan to be engineers. Many choose the concentration because they find it enlightening, stimulating, and worthwhile. This is evidenced by the popularity of CS 50, a course now rivaled in enrollment only by Economics 10. Designing, building, and programming are ways of looking at the world that ought to be seen as important modes of analysis.
In this vein, FAS and SEAS can actually help each other. A Harvard with strong humanities is a great place for engineers, because they learn not just how to build structures but also how to use them responsibly. A Harvard with strong engineering is a great place for philosophers, because they learn how to communicate their brilliance in technological language—the increasingly dominant global medium of exchange. (I can’t count how many times I have looked at a course website for a humanities class and wished the head TF had taken CS 50.)
At this point, a University without a solid engineering department is about as naked as one without an English department. It’s time the College adopts engineering. They’ll make the family that much stronger.

On March 8, I happened upon a group of distraught girls crying in Annenberg. They were shedding tears on what they said was their “worst day at Harvard so far”—earlier that morning, a person dressed in a fish costume handed them a letter explaining that they had been assigned to Cabot House. Crying over which House you were assigned by a random lottery sure seems immature, but can we really judge them for believing misconceptions about Cabot that upperclassmen had been telling them throughout their first semester and a half? Freshmen should not be conditioned pre-Housing Day to think that being placed in a specific House will be the death of them. The negative attitudes about housing created by upperclassmen should be replaced by more positive showcases of House spirit.
Every House has its merits and deficiencies, but the bottom line is that there is no such thing as bad housing at Harvard. As much as we cringe about the distance of the Quad, Mather, and Dunster from the Yard, ultimately all the Houses are relatively close to class. The Quad Houses are a mere 0.7 miles away from Memorial Hall. This 15 minute walk to class is short compared to the commutes faced at schools like Boston University, where students often have to take public transportation to get to class. Not to mention that Harvard provides a very efficient shuttle system. Mather Express and Quad Express depart from their respective stops every ten minutes from 8:20 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and 7:40 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. respectively.
Every year, freshmen are under the grossly misplaced belief that being “quadded” is the single worst thing that can happen to them at Harvard. And that Winthrop is full of cockroaches. And that Mather is the ugliest building on campus (Graduate School of Design, anyone?). On the eve of Housing Day, freshmen partake in “River Run”, a symptom the desperation that they feel about getting conveniently-located Houses like Adams or luxurious Houses like Eliot or Kirkland rather than a House in the Quad. When I ran into one of my closest friends during River Run, she grabbed my arm and whispered “Anything but Cabot. Anything but [expletive] Cabot.” When I saw her the next day, she was wearing a Cabot hat and was cheering along with the rest of Cabot inside Annenberg. By the end of the week, she was gushing to me about Cabot’s fantastic House life, energetic House community, and spacious rooms.
She, much like many freshmen out there and through no fault of her own, did not understand until the aftermath of Housing Day that all the Houses at Harvard are amazing places to live for the next three years. Upperclassmen are mostly responsible for creating this culture of misconceptions about housing. Soon after my blocking group received our housing assignment, I ran into my linkmates, who told me about their “hilarious” housing story—people chanted “Currier” outside their room for a good minute before storming in and announcing that my linking group had in fact been placed in Leverett House. The Crimson’s House rankings are followed religiously by freshmen—can you blame those who get into Dunster for not jumping for joy when they have been told by our student newspaper that they are officially a member of the worst House on campus? We should take it upon ourselves to create a more positive atmosphere of housing for freshmen. Rather than perpetuating incorrect stereotypes about particular Houses’ deficiencies, we should be doing more to advertise our Houses’ merits. The Freshman Dean’s Office should consider reserving a “Housing Weekend” a few weeks before Housing Day, where all the Houses can stage an open House with food and events. This way, freshmen will see that all Houses at Harvard have merits, and the deficiencies that freshmen incorrectly talk about really are minor in the face of a vibrant housing community at Harvard.
My blocking group was told by a crowd of excited Matherites and gorillas that we would be spending the next three years in the “box Dunster came in.” Seven of us were exuberant when we found out that we would be in a party House with a shuttle (we are a particularly party-prone and lazy blocking group). But my best friend asked me to throw her out of the window. As an art student, she could not stand the idea of living in modern-style Mather for three years. But a view from the high rise, a tour of Mather, a Master’s open House, and several parties later, she now has more Mather fever than anyone else in our blocking group. I know that she was not the only one who was distraught on Housing Day. These negative feelings are completely unnecessary and can be avoided if we take steps to reduce the amount of negativity surrounding housing for the sake of the incoming Class of 2016.

On Christmas Eve last year, my family received shocking news. A family member had died suddenly of a heart attack at 50 years of age. My grandmother, who was herself in ill health (she has since passed away), took the news with special difficulty. She began crying in the most disturbing sort of way, the sort of weeping one is sure will never end. The tragic news overwhelmed her, and she felt the death was more than she could bear. 
 Fortunately, however, because almost everyone in my family lives in upstate South Carolina, it was possible for a really beautiful thing to happen: My grandmother and all of her sisters, their kids and grandkids, all my aunts, uncles, cousins, and their friends joined together during that initial period of shock. The grief was only beginning, of course, but I can say for sure that in those first few days during Christmas, my whole family joined together to withstand the shock of Debbie’s death. Day and night, everyone stuck together. We brought one another strength. 
 
Last spring, I received news that a great friend of mine had been killed on his bicycle in traffic. His name was Matt King; he had brilliant curly red hair and piercing blue eyes; and he was a person of conviction, altruism, and love. He was also my age, a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, a true mathematical genius. 
 I was in the Science Center computer lab when I found out, and I couldn’t contain my emotions. I was crying, and as you may know, crying in public can be quite uncomfortable and embarrassing. So I packed my things quickly and started walking through the Yard back to Mather. I was still crying when I passed by Thayer Hall, which houses not just freshmen, but also the peer counseling group Room 13 in its basement. Wishing not to be crying out in the open, I found my way down to the basement and down the hall and knocked on the door of Room 13. 
 Two students answered the door, and I was able to talk confidentially a little bit to calm myself down. They had a big couch and a huge stuffed tiger (which made me laugh because Matt King was a Clemson Tiger in his undergraduate days and continued to resemble one after he had graduated). After a little bit of time, I took a deep breath and finished walking back to Mather. I was thankful the student staffers at Room 13, whose names I cannot remember, were there that night. A few days later, at Matt’s funeral, all of his friends and family, we were able to mourn together, which brought us strength. 
 Of course, at the end of the day, no matter our efforts, tragedies will continue to happen. We lost one of our own last week at Harvard College, Wendy H. Chang ’12, and it has sent shockwaves through our community. There is no upside to this tragedy, but a really beautiful thing happened in this case as well: A support meeting in Lowell was organized in no time and multiple memorial services occurred on campus, not only to honor Wendy, but also to acknowledge that with community comes strength.
If you are reading this and you are struggling—whether with grief over a loss or with depression and anxiety over day-to-day living—you are not alone. Reach out to those around you, whether to friends and family or to more formal resourceslike Room 13 and University Health Services. I am confident there are few things worse for grief, depression, anxiety and the like than isolation in a college dorm room. Remember, with community comes strength. Don’t be afraid to reach out. If you’re not sure how to reach out, look back in your inbox for last week's emails from Dean Hammonds or check out Harvard resources on the Harvard Smiles website. You might also consider attending Actively Moving Forward, the campus grief support group that meets on Thursdays, including this Thursday, May 3, in Emerson 106 at 8 p.m.
Finally, try to remember to check in with your friends if it seems like something is wrong. I missed a couple of meetings last week, and one of my friends sent me a text message just to make sure I was doing okay. I was okay, but still, it was great to know I was missed and that someone cared.

Jon Huntsman, Jr. walked into the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School two weeks ago with the confidant stride of a former presidential candidate. He had been invited to make a short speech and field questions from students, the kind of intimate event which would have been prohibitively low-profile just a few months ago.
“I’m a little perplexed,” Huntsman told a crowd of aspiring politicos. “I’m not sure why you want to hear from a failed candidate?”
Huntsman wore a well-cut navy suit, a white French-cuffed shirt, and a slender purple tie, his cuffs linked by two small red stones bordered with Chinese characters. If international statesmanship had a cover boy, it would certainly be Huntsman.
But on this occasion, the former State Department journeyman seemed more content being a has-been than the leading man. Occasionally savoring an expletive off-limits on the campaign trail, Huntsman offered up “random musings, if you will” of lessons learned in his various offices and campaigns through his over 25 years in politics.
On China’s political future: “How would you like to have six hundred million redundant farmers on your hands?”
On America’s aging infrastructure: “In politics, to utter the word ‘infrastructure’ will get you in trouble in some groups.”
On the presidential candidates: “The barriers to enter this game are pretty darn low. We’re a country of 315 million people...and this is the best we can do?”
Jokes aside, most of the hour-long talk was spent lamenting the lack of leadership in the Republican Party and throughout the capital. Before long, Huntsman removes his jacket and leans in toward the crowd.
“The party is not in a good place right now,” he said, pointing to candidates afraid to take bold stances and others afraid just to enter the race as evidence. Voters are getting fed up, he explained, and sooner or later they are going to do something about it.
It was not the first time Huntsman has been outspoken in his criticism of political leadership since calling it quits on his own campaign in January. He appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in February, telling host Joe Scarborough the GOP would probably be best served by a third-party movement. The statement rippled through the media and died out. (It’s hard for former candidates to make the news during primary season.) But Huntsman’s message is not likely to go away.
Case in point: likely Republican nominee Mitt Romney. After a half-decade long presidential campaign, the former Massachusetts governor finally appears to have secured himself a spot in the country’s biggest political showdown, but the stadium looks to be empty.
“I think Romney will show leadership on the economic deficit,” Huntsman said. “On the trust deficit, I don’t see a whole lot of leadership.”
Outside of the party bosses, Republicans around the country just don’t seem to care for Romney. That there are party die-hards more excited about the prospect of Jeb 2016 than Willard 2012 says a lot. Huntsman says it’s all about leadership. Voters don’t believe in Romney. Years as a campaigner have worn away his novelty and more importantly the clarity of his message.
“The people, they want to be told where you want to go,” Huntsman said. “They’ll give you the benefit of the doubt so long as we tell them upfront what we want to do...where we want to go.”
Things seem to be so bad in Huntsman’s view, that nothing short of a popular uprising will set the leadership straight. The leaders need to be led.
“My source of hope is that the American people, while sometimes late to the game, will demand change eventually,” Huntsman said.
The speech at Harvard was a last-minute affair tucked into a day jam-packed with appearances and private events. Despite the strong-handling of staff and his wife Mary Kaye’s bored looks, the politician couldn’t help shaking a few hands and posing for pictures. Even as he walked to the Harvard Square Hotel, Huntsman stopped periodically in an open plaza to chat with students trailing him.
“So, what do you study?”
Talking with Scarborough, Huntsman made it clear he was not the man for the job. He says he would be crazy to run for president again. Still, the emphasis with which he dismissed questions of a potential run in 2016 seemed almost too convincing, drawing knowing smiles from much of the Harvard crowd. Flanked by Mary Kaye, his campaign-trail shadow, post-candidate Huntsman affects a very contradictory air—an air that may be best described as, well, political.
“I never thought I’d run for public office. I used to make fun of people who ran for public office,” Huntsman joked with the crowd, his humor walking a fine line.
Huntsman may not be a candidate, but he’s not exactly off the trail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard A. Meserve, president of the Carnegie Institution for Science and former head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, will lead Harvard’s Board of Overseers—Harvard’s second highest governing body—for the 2013 academic year, the University announced Monday.
Lucy Fisher ’71, film producer and co-head of Red Wagon Entertainment, will serve as the Board of Overseers’ vice-chair.
“The Overseers bring essential experience and wisdom to the work of the University, and their perspectives assure that Harvard moves ahead with both ambition and care,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “With Dick Meserve and Lucy Fisher, we’re once again fortunate to have two alumni leaders of remarkable accomplishment and strongly complementary backgrounds to guide the board forward during the coming year.”
Meserve and Fisher will succeed Leila Fawaz, a professor at Tufts University, and Robert N. Shapiro ’72, a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray, respectively.
They will assume their positions following Commencement this May. Next year will be the final year of both Meserve and Fisher’s six-year Overseer term.
“It is a great honor to be selected as President of the Overseers,” Meserve wrote in an email. “Harvard is [a] very important institution, and it is somewhat humbling to assume a role in its governance.”
Meserve earned his undergradute degree from Tufts University, his J.D. from Harvard, and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Stanford. He served as chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1999 to 2003 and as a partner in the law firm of Covington & Burling from 1984 to 1999.
“I hope that my experiences provide sufficient foundation for serving a productive role in the even more complicated world that constitutes Harvard,” Meserve wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even though Graduation is right around the corner, hoodies and jeans are still out. The combination of mild weather and recent episodes of Game of Thrones has made it seem like cold winds are rising.
Since it feels like hockey season, we decided to see what the Harvard men’s hockey team has been up to in the offseason.  It appears that the season never stops, and neither do the Twitter updates.
Here are our favorite tweets of the week from the seniors on the Crimson hockey squad.  We think they give a pretty good idea of what life is like after Harvard hockey.
1) It appears that Colin Moore is watching a solid amount of TV during his senior spring.  The senior forward admitted this on April 23:
To answer your question Nickelodeon, yes I am #afraidofthedark
Kudos to Colin for taking the first step in conquering his fears and admitting he has a problem. Hopefully he was just flipping channels…
2) Defenseman and co-captain Ryan Grimshaw is turning to a special song to help him wake up in the morning.  The former Harvard stopper made this announcement on April 26:
Changing my alarm clock song to "Non Je Ne Regrette Rein" so I can feel like I'm getting the kick from inception every time I wake up.
Grimshaw should be all right as long as he’s got a totem to make sure he is awake. A custom hockey puck seems appropriate.
3) After being the big man on campus as a senior, Alex Killorn is back to the bottom of the food chain.  Grimshaw’s fellow Co-Captain is getting a taste of his own medicine as a rookie forward for the Norfolk Admirals, the Tampa Bay Lightning’s minor league team. On Apr. 26, Killorn shared this Tweet and an accompanying photo:
@moorepheus12 basically what my bunk is like on the sleeper bus. #rookieproblems
The far-from-comfortable accommodations prompted this revelation from the Former Crimson star:
Can't believe I use to complain about bus trips in the ECAC. #realitycheck
Yeah, those chartered bus rides are pretty rough. The whole “bathroom-any-time-you-want” thing and non-stop movies make for an uncomfortable ride. When will people realize that Harvard students are underprivileged?
Those are our tweets of the week.  To answer your question, the Harvard hockey team is doing just fine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (9-6, 5-2 Ivy) used a six-goal second half to down No. 10 Dartmouth (10-4, 5-2), 7-5, on Friday night at Harvard Stadium.
“We were really happy with our play on Friday,” junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “It was largely a defensive game in the first half, and I think our defense played great. They kept us in the game, and then the offense started to step up [in the second half], and it was great to put away a good team like Dartmouth.”
The Crimson had already clinched a bid to the Ivy League tournament by virtue of Princeton’s loss to Penn last Wednesday, but the team was looking to extend its four-game winning streak with a victory against a strong Big Green team.
Harvard, which struggled with consistency earlier this season and dropped its first two Ivy League contests, will now compete for the Ivy League’s automatic berth to the NCAA tournament in the four-team tournament that begins this Friday at Penn.
“It was a really exciting win,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “I think we are peaking at the right time. Obviously we were thrilled to clinch a spot the Ivy League tournament. We wanted to win the game and to continue to feel good about our chances in the Ivy League tournament.”
In Friday’s matchup, both squads turned in impressive defensive performances in the opening frame.
Dartmouth struck first with 13:01 to play in the first, but the Crimson countered with a goal by VanderMeulen. With 2:41 to go, the Big Green notched its second goal off a Liz Calby score to take a 2-1 lead into the break.
“I think [the low scoring half] was a testament to the defenses of both teams which were fantastic,” Baskind said. “This was a game between two very good lacrosse teams. We knew it was going be a close game.”
The Big Green came out with another goal in the second half to push its lead to 3-1. Baskind rose to the occasion for Harvard with two consecutive goals to even the score, 3-3, with 27:21 to go. But Dartmouth soon regained the lead off Calby’s second score to go up, 4-3.
“Both teams were taking smarter shots in the second half,” Baskind said. “In the second half, both teams were a little more competitive going to the cage. People took more chances and played more aggressively.”
But from there Harvard took control. The Crimson scored three consecutive goals to take 6-4 lead with 12:40 to go in the second half. Junior Micaela Cyr led the charge this time with two consecutive goals assisted by VanderMeulen.
Freshman goalkeeper Kelly Weis helped close the game for the Crimson, recording three saves on four shots in the final 11:01 of play. The Big Green managed to pull within one with 5:59 to go, but was unable to get any closer as its final two attempts were denied. VanderMeulan capped off the win with a score with eight seconds to play.
With the win in its regular season finale, the Crimson now sets it sights on the four-team, single elimination Ivy League tournament. Last season, Harvard fell in the championship matchup to Princeton and was denied the conference’s automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.
“[Friday’s win] is huge going into the tournament,” Baskind said. “We had some low points in the season and fighting through those made us more competitive and smarter.… Now that we know we are playing on a level we have been trying to reach all year, it makes [us] a lot more confident going into this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into Saturday’s match against Dartmouth, the Harvard women’s tennis team was out of contention for the Ivy League title, and it knew its contest against the Big Green was going to be its last of the year.
But the Crimson (11-7, 4-3 Ivy) had something else to play for: retribution. Having lost to Dartmouth (8-13, 2-5) last year, 4-3, Harvard was looking for a chance to get back at its conference rivals.
And the Crimson did just that, beating the Big Green by the same score of 4-3 at Boss Tennis Center and Gordon Pavilion on Saturday in Hanover, N.H.
“We lost to Dartmouth last year, and we were still kind of bitter about it, which is a good thing,” senior Samantha Gridley said. “You want to come into the last match really wanting it. It’s hard at the end of the season to still come with the same fire that you had in the first match, but we definitely had that going in.”
The win tied the Crimson with Columbia—who Harvard beat, 4-3, three weeks ago in the team’s second Ivy contest—for third place in the Ancient Eight behind Princeton and undefeated Yale.
The victory also pushed the Crimson above .500 in conference play to a record of 4-3.
Harvard’s losses came against the Bulldogs, the Tigers, and Penn, which finished in sixth place with a 2-5 Ivy League record.
“We came into the weekend really hoping to end in third place,” junior co-captain Kristin Norton said. “We knew we couldn’t win the Ivy League anymore, but we still wanted that third-place spot.”
“We actually could have landed in a three-way tie for second if Princeton lost,” Norton added.
Norton, junior Camille Jania, and freshman Kelly Whelan, all won both their singles and doubles matches to lead Harvard to the 4-3 win.
The Crimson dominated the doubles matches, winning on all three courts.
This proved to be the deciding factor as the two teams split the singles  matches, 3-3.
The tandem of Whelan and sophomore Natalie Blosser defeated Dartmouth’s Rachel Decker-Sadowski and Janet Liu, 8-3, on the No. 2 court. Meanwhile, Gridley and Jania took down Melissa Matsuoka and Theresa Smith at the No. 3 spot by the same score.
The No. 1 court was a closer battle, but Norton and junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana topped Jeri Reichel and Akiko Okuda, 8-6, to give Harvard the doubles sweep.
Up 1-0, the Crimson entered singles play. Norton and Blosser were the first players to finish at the No. 2 and No. 4 positions, respectively. Norton overcame Liu, 6-4, 6-4, while Blosser lost to Smith, 6-2, 6-2.
Both Tachibana and Jania’s first sets went into a tiebreaker. On the No. 1 court, Tachibana dropped the first set, 7-6(4) before losing the second, 6-1. But Jania kept Harvard one point ahead by taking a 7-6(3), 6-3 decision over Okuda at the No. 3 spot.
Gridley, at the No. 5 position, and Whelan, playing on the No. 6 court, went into three sets each.
Having lost the first set, 6-1, Gridley came back to take the second set by the same score, but the Big Green’s Sabrina Stewart won the final set, 7-6(4), to tie up the team score.
The match came down to Whelan’s matchup against Decker-Sadowski. Whelan lost the first set, 1-6, but won the next two, 7-5, 7-5, to clinch the team win for the Crimson.
“Everybody just fought so hard, and I was really proud of Whelan for pulling that out for us at the end,” Norton said.
The match put winning bookends on Harvard’s spring season and was the last competition for its lone senior, Gridley.
“I think that everybody wanted to win not only for us but also for me because it was my last match as a senior,” Gridley said. “Everybody just fought so hard. And it was kind of emotional at the end, but I was so glad that we were able to pull it out and end the season on a high note like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team split its doubleheader against Dartmouth on Sunday in Hanover, N.H. Having split Saturday’s doubleheader as well, the Crimson comes out of this weekend with two conference losses against the Big Green. Before the four-game series, Harvard had lost only one Ivy League match, when it fell to Cornell in late March.
After shutting out Dartmouth, 4-0, in the first contest of the day, the Crimson (31-13, 17-3 Ivy) could not keep the momentum going into the second game and ultimately fell, 9-3, to the Big Green (14-25, 7-13).
Harvard struggled in the second matchup without sophomore pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who suffered a sprained ankle the day before. Over the past two seasons, Ricciardone has paired with co-captain Rachel Brown to form a one-two punch that has been crucial to the Crimson’s success both this season and last, when the team won the Ivy League championship.
But on Saturday, Ricciardone went down during the fifth inning after holding Dartmouth to one run on three hits, keeping her off the mound on Sunday.
“Not having Laura on the mound is definitely hard for our team,” senior shortstop Jane Alexander said. “She’s such a strong presence in the circle, and we love having her out there. She’s very dependable and such a strong force for our team.”
Ricciardone is expected to return in time for the Ivy League Championship Series in two weeks.
DARTMOUTH 9, HARVARD 3
In the second game of the day, Ricciardone’s absence, paired with the team’s offensive struggles, appeared to hurt the Crimson, as it fell, 9-3.
After a scoreless first inning, the Big Green was the first team on the scoreboard, plating in a run in the bottom of the second.
Harvard was unable to respond at the plate in the third, and Dartmouth continued its rally in the bottom half, scoring six more runs to put the Crimson in a seven-run hole.
In the fourth inning, Harvard got on the board.
Sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange reached first after getting hit by a pitch and then advanced to second base on freshman Katherine Appelbe’s single. Rookie Katie Lantz grounded out, allowing Lange to touch home, and freshman Adrienne Hume gained first on an infield error, putting Appelbe in scoring position.
Appelbe then scored on a passed ball, and the third Crimson run came in when junior Jess Ferri singled up the middle to knock in Hume.
In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Crimson replaced rookie hurler Gabby Ruiz with senior Marika Zumbro, who held the Big Green scoreless for the next two innings.
“Mari and Gabby haven’t really gotten in many innings throughout the season, so to do what they did was really great,” Brown said. “I think they’ll only improve given more opportunities.”
The top of the sixth inning proved to be another scoreless half for the Crimson lineup, and in the following half, Zumbro allowed two hits and two runs, as Harvard’s deficit increased to six.
The Crimson was unable to answer in the seventh inning, and the team lost, 9-3.
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 0
Brown fanned 12 and the Harvard defense allowed just one error to lead the Crimson squad to a 4-0 shutout win in the first game of the day.
Though Dartmouth hurler Kristen Rumley earned an impressive 11 strikeouts in seven innings, it was not enough to stop the Harvard offense, which still finished with six compared to the Big Green’s one.
Lange homered in the top of the first inning to give the Crimson an early one-run advantage.
In the bottom of the inning, Rumley responded by ripping a double, but her team failed to keep the rally going, and she was ultimately left on second base. This would be the furthest that any Big Green hitter advanced in the contest.
The following three innings proved to be a pitchers’ battle, as neither team was able to produce a single hit or run.
In the fifth inning, Harvard extended its lead to two runs when sophomore catcher Allison Scott smacked a solo home run.
The sixth inning featured another Crimson run, making the score 3-0. Freshman center fielder Andrea Del Conte hit a double and then advanced to third base on Alexander’s sacrifice bunt. Next up, sophomore right fielder Shelbi Olson grounded out, allowing Del Conte to score.
Harvard earned one final run in the top of the seventh inning to make it a 4-0 game. Scott singled up the middle, and freshman Camilla Gibson, pinch running for Scott, then reached second on a steal. Zumbro followed with a single to right center and Gibson touched home.
Dartmouth was unable to score in its last licks, and the Crimson came away with the shutout win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even in the midst of winds that reached 40 miles per hour, the Harvard women’s golf team was able to keep its winning streak alive and earn a first-place finish at the Ivy League Championships this past weekend.
Sophomore Bonnie Hu took first place individually at the three-day tournament, shooting a score of 225 (+12) to earn the wire-to-wire victory at the par-71 Seaview Bay Course in Galloway, N.J.
Riding the momentum from a victory at its last tournament, the Roar-EE Invitational, the Crimson took its first league championship in three years.
With an overall team score of 952 (+100), Harvard finished six strokes better than second-place finisher Penn. Yale, which edged out the Crimson for first place in last year’s Ancient Eight showdown, earned a third-place finish with a score of 962 (+110).
Columbia (+120), Brown (+133), Princeton (+163), and Dartmouth (+177) rounded out the bottom four spots
“We haven’t won in three years, but each year the team is different,” said Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor. “There was definitely pressure because we knew that we were good enough to win.”
In addition to the team’s Ivy League title, the Crimson earned a host of individual accolades. Hu was named to the All-Ivy First Team, and senior Jane Lee received second-team honors.
After being ranked as the sixth best freshman in the nation coming into the year by Golfweek Magazine, freshman Tiffany Lim was also awarded the Ivy League Rookie of the Year accolade.
Lim added to her success this weekend by placing ninth individually with a score of 241 (+28). She was closely followed by Lee, who tied for 10th after shooting a 244 (+31).
The entire Crimson squad finished in the top 15 individually.
Freshman Brenna Nelsen shot a 246 (+33) en route to a tie for 12th place. Senior Christine Cho came in right behind Nelson by finishing tied for 15th with an overall score of 247 (+34).
Despite Harvard’s ultimate victory, the weekend did not begin well for the Crimson. After round one, which featured unusually difficult playing conditions, Harvard sat in third place behind the Quakers and the Bulldogs, shooting a 332.
Hu was still able to notch a 77 on Friday, putting her in the first-place position. Lim shot an 83, followed by Lee with an 86.
“It was really tough on Friday because of the winds,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “The greens were fast and sloped, and there were super tough tee placements. We saw lots of people doing lots of crazy things, so it became how much [we could] stay focused and rely on the skills that [we] have and not get distracted by what’s going on.”
Lim said, “None of us had ever played in conditions like that before, so we weren’t completely prepared. We did a really good job with our mental game and managing the putt position. Otherwise, we would have never been in the position that we were going into the last few days.”
Hu stayed in control on Saturday, shooting a 73 to maintain a three-shot lead over Penn’s Isabel Han and Columbia’s Michelle Piyapattra, the Ivy League Player of the Year.
Lim rallied on Saturday for her best day of the tournament, shooting a 78. And behind Lim and Hu, Harvard shot a 308 on Saturday, the best single-day performance of any team at the championships, to take the lead going into the tournament’s final day.
The Crimson led the way again on Sunday with a score of 312, shooting the low score for the second day in a row.
Hu earned a comfortable five-stroke victory with a 75 on Sunday.
“[Hu] hit it really far[and] straight all week,” Rhoads said. “She was controlling her distances[and] her mental game well. She led the field in putting which, as difficult as the greens were, was the most pivotal part of the tournament.”
Lee’s 76 was her best round of the tournament. Lim shot an 80 to fall to ninth place, while Nelson and Cho followed with an 82 and an 81, respectively.
The Crimson now faces its next challenge at the NCAA Regional tournament on May 10th at the Penn State Golf Courses.
“We knew that we had a shot to go to Regionals before coming into the tournament,” Lim said. “We knew that if we just did our job and played well at the tournament, we’d make it in. Now that we did win, we have some confidence going into [NCAAs].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And so it ends.
After coming into the weekend with an outside chance at making the Ivy League playoffs, the Harvard baseball team saw its season come to a close Sunday, splitting its doubleheader at Rolfe Division champion Dartmouth.
“We were all a lot happier with how we played [Sunday] compared to Saturday,” junior Rob Wineski said. “[Sunday] we came out hard and really gave Dartmouth all they could handle. Obviously we were disappointed by not taking more games away from them, but with a team like Dartmouth that is tough and has been doing well all season, we’re just happy we gave them a solid showing. The season ended on a pretty high note.”
Despite the optimism, the final record extended a streak of losing seasons that dates back five years to an 18-18 2007 campaign.
DARTMOUTH 8, HARVARD 3
The season ended much the way that it started, with poor fielding by Harvard (12-30, 8-12 Ivy) dooming the Crimson to a loss. Like in its March 2 contest at No. 7 Arizona, when Harvard committed three fielding errors en route to a 7-1 defeat, Sunday afternoon’s season-high five errors proved too much to recover from for the Crimson offense. Harvard fell, 8-3, despite outhitting Dartmouth (22-16, 14-6), 11-10.
After leading off the scoring with a Jake McGuiggan RBI double in the first, Harvard gave up a six-run bottom of the second on just four hits. Freshman pitcher Tanner Anderson started the game, surrendering only seven hits in six innings. But after hitting Dartmouth’s Dustin Selzer with a pitch to start the second, it all went downhill.
In the next at-bat, senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds committed a throwing error to first, one of five on the weekend for him, to put runners on first and second. A wild pitch by Anderson advanced both runners, followed by a throwing error by freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira that brought Selzer home for an unearned run.
Big Green freshman Matt Robinson knocked in another runner on a single before scoring himself on another throwing error by McGuiggan. In total, the Crimson gave up three unearned runs in the second inning alone. McGuiggan added an RBI in the top of the third, giving him 21 on the season to go with his team-leading .352 batting average.
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 7
The first game of the doubleheader was the Nick Saathoff show. Coming into the weekend, the freshman designated hitter had seen just 29 plate appearances, registering only eight hits. In his first two at-bats of the day, Saathoff knocked one out of the park in the second and doubled down the right field line in the third, bringing five runners in for the Crimson.
“It was a really nice win we got over them in the first game,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “Unfortunately we couldn’t come away with the second.”
With a seven-run lead entering the bottom of the third, a victory seemed assured.
But a five-run bottom of the third, punctuated by a Jeff Keller grand slam, prompted a pitching change from Walsh and turned the rest of the game into a  defensive affair as both teams tried to hold the other at bay.
Harvard managed just one more hit, a single by sophomore Jack Colton in the top of the sixth, but it proved to be enough as a McGuiggan sacrifice fly brought the winning run home. Junior pitcher Joey Novak (1-3) was awarded the win after pitching 2.2 innings in relief, giving up five hits and two earned runs.
Senior Will Keuper, who recently returned from injury, closed the game, earning his first save of the season.
“I’m just so happy for him,” Walsh said. “He’s a senior who hung in there through rehab every single day working hard to get a final appearance, and we really missed him this year. He’s a guy who was very valuable to our pitching staff.”
The conclusion of the weekend’s games marked the end of the road for a senior class that leaves Harvard with an overall combined record of 51-120.
“Even though our record didn’t really show it, we were a completely different team this year from last, and it’s all on those [seniors’] leadership,” Wineski said. “They’ve led our team all year, and they just really set the tone for the rest of us throughout the season.”
As the members of the Class of 2012 finally hung up their cleats, they reflected upon their experiences in Cambridge.
“I just want to give a special thanks to all the coaches and the fans and the teammates for making this experience as a member of the Class of 2012 so great,” senior pitcher Brent Suter said. “Obviously I’ll never forget it or them. Sometimes things don’t work out in the win-loss column, but the friendships I’ve made here will last a lifetime. It’s been an honor to wear the Harvard uniform.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was another weekend of dominant racing for Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew.
While the heavyweights swept all five races against Northeastern, including the varsity eight’s Smith Cup victory, the lightweights topped Yale and Princeton, earning a varsity eight and team win to capture the Goldthwait Cup and Vogel Cup, respectively.
HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. NORTHEASTERN
The strong headwinds on Saturday morning added another obstacle to the racing course on the Charles. But Harvard heavyweights handled the difficult conditions well enough to topple Northeastern in each race of the morning.
In the 1V race, the Crimson finished in 6:21.2, 3.4 seconds ahead of the Huskies. Harvard got out in front early on, holding a six-seat lead over Northeastern at the 500-meter mark, but the Huskies continued to push the Crimson throughout the duration of the race. Despite the pressure, Harvard was able to respond and finished just shy of an open water victory.
The win gave Harvard its 15th straight Smith Cup victory and extended the boat’s undefeated record in the dual season.
“We had very tough conditions, but we definitely didn’t handle them as well as we could have,” said captain Michael DiSanto, seven seat of the first varsity boat. “Part of the sport is being able to handle anything that comes your way…. We are going to need to row a lot better.”
Despite the victory, DiSanto was far from pleased with his boat’s performance and did not view the challenging conditions as a valid excuse for the poor quality of rowing.
“I would almost say we lost because of how badly we rowed,” DiSanto said.
While Northeastern was able to maintain overlap with the Harvard 1V, the Crimson secured open water over the Huskies’ in the second varsity and freshman eight races. The second varsity boat recorded the biggest eights win over Northeastern on Saturday, as the crew took the lead early and finished the race in 6:26.2, 15.1 seconds ahead of the Huskies.
The Harvard first freshman eight also defeated Northeastern by a solid margin of six seconds.  The second freshman boat raced as two fours, with the Crimson A four outpacing the Huskies by 22.8 seconds.
The third and fourth varsity eights also had solid showings, defeating Boston University’s third varsity eight with times of 6:36.1 and 6:46.9, respectively. The Terriers came in 2.1 seconds after the 4V.
Despite any frustration, it was overall a successful weekend on the Charles for Harvard. Now, the Crimson now readies itself for the EARC Sprints in two weeks in Worcester.
“I wish we had a better row, but it was nice to win at least,” DiSanto said. “Our focus is on Worcester.”
NO. 1 LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. YALE, PRINCETON
In the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton regatta, the biggest dual race of the season for the Crimson lightweights, Harvard was able to finish off its undefeated dual season with a varsity and team win on Saturday in Derby, Conn.
The competition between these three top teams also provides a good indicator going into Sprints.
“We like to think of HYP as the first of our championship races,” said senior Tim Moore, six seat of the first varsity eight. “It’s an old rivalry between all three of the schools.  We know that all of the teams get up for it and come ready to race us. We definitely were excited to bring one of our best pieces yesterday.”
The first varsity boat, starting in the middle lane, took an open-water lead on Princeton early on and finished in 5:31.2, 4.2 seconds ahead of the Tigers and six seconds ahead of Yale.  The Crimson, steered by senior coxswain Angela Chang, expertly handled the significant turn in the Yale course.
“It is an interesting course with a big turn,” said sophomore Michael Wales, bow seat of the first varsity eight. “When you are sitting on the start line, it appears that you are down.  It is a mental barrier that we had to work past and overcome.”
Harvard’s additional victories in the third varsity and second freshman races allowed the team to secure the Vogel Cup because of the overall team win. The second varsity eight fell to both Yale and Princeton, while the first freshman eight lost to the Tigers by a narrow 1.4-second margin.
After losing to Yale by .02 seconds in last season’s first varsity race at IRA National Championships, the 1V was excited to have had such a strong showing against their rival team.
“We have a bad taste in our mouth,” Moore said about last year’s results. “There is some revenge to be had.  But close racing is what is great about the league. We use that as motivation to remind us of what we are working towards.”
As the Crimson lightweights approach Sprints in two weeks, they are working on maintaining their edge and positive trajectory while trying to avoid the complacency that comes with a top ranking.
“The easy thing to do would be to say, ‘We had an undefeated season and we are the number one seed, so Sprints is going to be locked up,’” Wales said. “But going forward we are going to step our game up.  Yeah, we’re fast, but we need to get faster.”

The Harvard women’s water polo team finished its season Sunday after clinching seventh place in the College Water Polo Association’s Eastern Division.
Seeded seventh, the Crimson held its seed over the three-day tournament by splitting its games, 2-2, and bookended the weekend with significant wins.
“We were hoping to improve on our seed, but we played well this season,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said.
Minnis said the brightest spots of the weekend were when Harvard was keeping pace with its ranked opponents, No. 11 Indiana and No. 12 Princeton before eventually falling.
“It just shows that we’re right there banging down the door of top-twenty teams,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 11, BUCKNELL 3
The Crimson finished its season on a positive note Sunday afternoon in a decisive win over the Bison.
“Beating Bucknell was special because it was the last time that our team will play together,” Minnis said. “It was special that they got to go out with a win.”
For the fourth time this season, the Crimson cruised to a victory over the Bison, despite coming off two rough losses against Indiana and Princeton.
Six Harvard players contributed goals in the win, including all four of the Crimson seniors.
Co-captain Shannon Purcell and junior attacker Aisha Price scored three goals apiece.
By halftime, Harvard held a 6-2 lead, which it extended in the second frame thanks to a 5-1 run.
INDIANA 7, HARVARD 5
After falling behind, 5-1, against Indiana in the first quarter of Saturday’s game, the Crimson finally hit its stride with two minutes left in the first half.
“We came back…and played well from then on out,” Minnis said. “We had opportunities to beat Indiana, but we just got unlucky and didn’t convert when we needed to.”
The team mounted a comeback with two back-to-back goals from senior attacker Monica Zdrojewski and freshman attacker Victoria Frager before halftime, but it was too late.
Harvard never took a lead and was unable to close the gap in the second half.
The Hoosiers’ defense, anchored by goalie Cassie Wyckoff, who had eight saves in the game, proved to be a challenge for the Crimson.
Indiana’s defense relaxed in the second half, allowing Harvard the opportunity to sneak within one goal of its competition in the last seven minutes of the game.
PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 6
In Friday afternoon’s quarterfinals, the Crimson fell to the Tigers, who were coming off a first-round bye.
As has been the case for Harvard in many losses this season, the game was decided in the third quarter, in which Princeton went on a dominant 4-1 run.
“Princeton has five girls coming off the bench who are very solid,” Minnis said. “They’re good at wearing people down.”
The Crimson managed to hold the tournament’s eventual champions to a 3-3 tie at the half, but a charge led by Tiger sophomore utility Katie Rigler, who had a game-high of four goals, was too much for Harvard.
Zdrojewski and Kennifer each contributed two goals in the match to keep the Crimson within reach of their top-twenty opponent.
HARVARD 14, MERCYHURST 4
For the third time this season, the Crimson routed the Lakers on Friday morning in a first-round victory.
Harvard built up a 6-2 lead by the end first quarter and added to that with four unanswered goals before halftime. After taking an eight-goal lead, the Crimson rested a number of its starters in the second frame. Harvard finished with a 10-goal lead, its fifth largest of the season.
Zdrojewski finished with a hat trick in the game, the start of a strong weekend for the attacker in her final games in a Crimson uniform.
“We have four seniors who have done a lot for the team and program,” Minnis said. “This will go down in my mind as one of the best teams of all time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final weekend of the regular season, the Harvard track and field team made one thing very clear: It is ready for the postseason.
Members of both the Crimson’s men’s and women’s squads turned in impressive performances over the weekend, as they traveled to the Penn Relays, the Brown Springtime Invitational, and the Payton Jordan Invitational.
PENN RELAYS
Though next weekend’s Outdoor Heptagonal Championships is Harvard’s most important meet of the outdoor season, the Crimson competed in the largest meet on its schedule this past weekend—the Penn Relays.
Fielding over 14,000 competitors, from high schoolers to professional runners, the Penn Relays allowed a number of Harvard’s athletes an opportunity to face off against some elite competition. Track and field powerhouses Texas A&M and LSU were both in attendance at the 117th installment of the meet, held at Penn’s historic Franklin Field in Philadelphia.
“You see some of the best athletes in the country,” Saretsky said. “[The level of competition] was very, very strong, as it is every year [at the Penn Relays].”
But the level of competition that Harvard faced was not the only unique aspect of the relays. Total attendance at the three-day event is roughly 100,000 people, many of who are there to watch some of the world’s best track and field athletes.
“The size of the meet is incredible,” sophomore Alaina Murphy said. “There’s so much excitement, not just toward the athletes, but toward track and field in general.”
Saretsky noted that, due to the number of spectators at Franklin Field, athletes were not given a typical amount of time to warm up for their races. The noise during races was also problematic, according to Saretsky, as athletes are often unable to hear their coaches.
“Penn Relays is really about the fans and is not at all athlete-friendly,” Saretsky said. “So as an athlete, you have to make adjustments and just go out there and perform despite the adverse conditions.”
The conditions proved to be a nonfactor for some members of the Crimson squad, as the team delivered some personal-best performances and picked up a pair of event wins in the process.
“It was a great meet for us,” Saretsky said. “We rested a number of athletes [because] it was the week before [the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships], but we took a solid group down to the Penn Relays, and I think we performed really, really well.”
Murphy and classmate Natalia Paine, freshman Erika Veidis, and senior Meg Looney earned an event win for Harvard in the 4x800 meter relay. The team crossed the finish line in 8:53.95, a time that ranks sixth in school history, to top a field that included Purdue University (second place) and Ivy foe Penn (fourth place). The Crimson did not hold the lead in the event until the last leg, when Looney picked up the pace and earned her team the victory.
“[Looney] really thrived on having that crowd cheer her on as she rounded the final turn,” Saretsky said.
Away from the track, the Crimson’s throwers continued to be a force to be reckoned with.
Sophomore Dustin Brode won the shot put with a 17.62-meter hurl. The mark was Brode’s farthest of the season and was just shy of his personal best of 17.65 meters, which is the second best in school history. Brode also competed in the discus for Harvard, finishing in 21st place with a mark of 47.04 meters.
Freshman Ben Glauser earned second place in the hammer throw with a personal-best toss of 58.29 meters. University of Michigan’s Brad Bolton bested Glauser, throwing a mark of 60.25 meters to take home the event title.
“I was particularly pleased with our throwers,” Saretsky said. “Without a doubt, their training is designed for them to be at their best come championship time, when it matters most.”
BROWN SPRINGTIME INVITATIONAL
A small group of Crimson athletes traveled to Providence, R.I. on Sunday to compete in the Brown Springtime Invitational. Though the squad faced a more modest level of competition in Providence than at the Penn Relays, Harvard was able to use the meet as one final tune-up before the all-important Heps meet next weekend.
A group of distance runners highlighted the meet for Harvard in the 3000m run. Junior Stewart Richardson led a pack of six Crimson runners as they took the top six places in the event.
PAYTON JORDAN INVITATIONAL
First-year middle distance runner Adam Cotton was Harvard’s only representative at the Payton Jordan Invitational, hosted by Stanford University. The rookie faced an especially deep field in the 1500m run and finished in 11th place with a time of 3:47.52. The time stands as the seventh-best in Crimson history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team had a chance at taking the Ivy League Championships in the last round of the weekend at the par-71 Galloway National Golf Club.
But a few too many shots did not go the Crimson’s way, and Harvard finished in fourth place overall, just five strokes behind the University of Pennsylvania and Dartmouth, and three strokes behind third place Columbia.
Despite consistent play in the last two rounds, Harvard could not overcome stronger rounds from a very tight field, as the Quakers finally won the decisive sudden death playoff against the Big Green in Galloway, N.J.
“We knew it was going to be really competitive going in because a lot of teams were very close this year,” sophomore Theo Lederhausen said. “We knew it would come down to just a key few strokes, but we’re pretty disappointed. We lost by five; it’s [essentially] one stroke for each of us.”
Trailing Dartmouth and Columbia by 15 strokes and 11 strokes, respectively, entering the last round, the Crimson began to close the gap alongside Penn, with both surging towards the top of the leaderboard.
“We knew we had to do something very good to have a chance because 15 shots is quite a bit to make up,” Lederhausen said. “But the course is hard, so we knew that if we put up really good numbers, we’d have a good chance.”
Strong winds during the last few holes tightened the pressure, as the leading pair collapsed and Penn and Harvard continued their strong play.
“Maybe five or six holes into it, we realized we had a chance,” said captain Tony Grillo, who finished the weekend tied for seventh at +17. “And you start to feel that team pressure rather than that individual pressure. It’s a really cool feeling.”
But a score of 303 on the day was not enough to propel the Crimson into the tiebreaker, and the Ivy League title once again eluded Harvard.
A strong final round for Penn—294, the low of the weekend—and the play of individual champion Peter Williamson of the Big Green kept the Crimson from winning its first Ivy League title since 1975.
“This is definitely the closest we’ve come to winning since I’ve been here, and maybe in a long time,” Grillo said.
The pressure at the Ivies was something new for Harvard, and something that the team will look to build off of in the coming years.
“I think it’s really exciting that we were there,” Grillo said. “The whole team felt that feeling of being in the heat of the moment for the first at least in recent memory, so I think that’s really good for the guys behind me.”
“It’s an experience to take away from that we know we’re good enough to win the title so next season it’s going to be very exciting,” sophomore Seiji Liu added.
In the first two rounds, freshman Akash Mirchandani battled strong winds to lead the Crimson with scores of 77 and 72, finally finishing tied for seventh as well after an 81 in his third round.
“Akash played great,” Grillo said. “Especially in the first two days, he kept us in it.”
Lederhausen led the way in the final round, posting a team-low 72 after shooting an 83 and then a 78 in the first two rounds. Lederhausen finished 15th overall at +15.
Fellow sophomore Seiji Liu finished the tournament tied for 18th at +23 after rounds of 81, 77, and 78.
Senior Mark Pollak finished up his collegiate career +23 on the weekend, good for a tie for 19th. Pollak finished six shots behind classmate Grillo, who posted scores of 79, 75, and 76.
“They definitely started the rebuilding process for this team,” Liu said. “I think a lot of us wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them putting the program on the map and showing that the players on Harvard can be competitive.”
Despite the loss, the close competition and defeat provided the Crimson both with an experience it had not had at Ivies of late and a starting point for next season’s squad.
“We felt the failure of not winning,” Lederhausen said. “We felt the pressure and we were right there. We can build off that next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, the historic game of croquet was restored to Harvard’s athletic fields, and the young team has already catapulted to success on a national scale. The recently re-founded Harvard croquet team competed in the United States Croquet Association Collegiate National Championships this past weekend in Haverford, Penn., placing fifth in the country.
While croquet is nothing new at Harvard, the squad has only sporadically existed in the last several decades, a shadow of its former glory. But according to sophomore captain Eric Brewster, Harvard is back in the game. And it's back to stay.
“We were the nation’s finest in the 80s,” Brewster explained. “We had a very strong team.” And with this recent resurrection the team is “hoping that Harvard is entering a croquet renaissance.”
The current A team is comprised of six members, all sophomores, who compete in pairs of two. Brewster plays with Nikhil Mehra alongside the pairings of Ben Silva and Mariel Pettee and Caleb Thompson and Tobi Tikolo.
The three pairings competed separately over the course of the weekend, with all the performances working towards their aggregated score. By the second day, the Crimson was one of eight teams to qualify for the final round, where the team went up against some of the powerhouses of the croquet world, like SUNY New Paltz University, Case Western Reserve University, and Davidson University.
“The team had some very close calls in the final round,” Brewster said. “We had a few crucial matches which were both lost in heartbreaking last-second plays.” Brewster described the moments as “kind of like last-second buzzer beaters in basketball.”
But the team is nowhere close to being done.
“We’re extremely determined to come back next year and take it all,” Brewster said.  “We just need a little more work on strategy, accuracy, and funding.”
While the young age of its starting lineup means that all six players should be returning next spring, the squad is also determined to work on the size of its roster.
But when asked about his team’s recruiting techniques, Brewster only said, “We believe that the glory of croquet has its own appeal. You don’t find croquet, croquet finds you.”
As for the rest of us, we can only hope that Harvard’s croquet team will continue on its march back to the national croquet spotlight, where, Brewster promises, it will “restore Harvard’s glory and greatness.”

It's a jungle in the dorm room of juniors Laura E. D'Asaro, Juhi R. Kuchroo, Madeline M. Magnuson, Miriam E. Psychas, and Danni Xie. Inspired by their purchase of a frog tent at a senior sale last year, the room's jungle theme reveals the artistic creativity of its inhabitants.
"When you decorate it, you make it yours. It creates a feeling of hominess—somewhere that you actually want to be," Magnuson said.
Murals span the walls, with images of the roommates and their blockmates painted into jungle scenes. "It's supposed to represent a bit of each person and their personality and how they might act in the jungle," D'Asaro said.
The room also has some quirky objects in the form of animals. From the frog tent named Balthazar to the giant plush bear named Brutus, the animals tie in with the theme of the room and contribute to its wild feel.
With flowers decorating the fireplace mantle and potted plants by the windowsill, the residents have a mix of real and fake flora scattered throughout the space.
Aside from the numerous plants, the residents of this Kirkland suite also have numerous lanterns to make sure that their room is full of light. Sixty-three paper lanterns hang from the ceiling. This is 57 fewer than the astonishing 120 from last semester, but the light from the dozens of lanterns still attracts attention from passersby and Kirkland residents.
"When people realize that this is our room, they're always like 'Oh you're that room with all the lanterns,'" D'Asaro said.
The hammock draped across the center of the common room also commands notice. The hammock, which D'Asaro picked up in Mexico, cuts across the center of the room and provides an area to relax, but, according to Magnuson, "it's down more often than not just for ease of going through."
Wanting to change it up, the roommates already have plans for their room theme next year. "It's going to be Greek and Roman themed," D'Asaro said.
If you feel like planning ahead for your room next semester, D'Asaro and Magnuson provided some tips to make your dorm room into a place that will reflect your personality.
Tips:
1. "Painting and drawing is a really cheap and fun way to decorate your room and makes it really personal," D'Asaro said.
2. "Paper lanterns fit everyone's personality. They always just make everything cooler. Also, they provide more light than usual," Magnuson said.
3. Make your room even more personable by adding a quote wall. "Quote walls are fantastic because otherwise you're going to forget all of those things that made you laugh so hard," Magnuson said.

Exactly 2,032 students were accepted to the class of 2016, and those who haven't already committed must make a decision tomorrow. While we here at Flyby know the choice is obvious, we offer this playlist to any prospective students still grappling with indecision.
 
"Should I Stay or Should I Go?" by The Clash
 
Apparently Joe Strummer has a tough choice to make, but the lyrics are the only clue that he's not enjoying the decision-making process. Getting caught between a rock and a hard place has never sounded this good.
"Dilemma" by Nelly ft. Kelly Rowland
 
A duet between two would-be lovers, separated only by Kelly Rowland's boyfriend. Neither of them knows what to do, but at least they make a smooth R&B track while they're doing it.
 
"Freedom of Choice" by Devo
Devo reminds us that indecision isn't always related to love—sometimes, it's a result of being confronted by the bewildering array of choices that come with our consumerist society.
"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself" by Tommy Hunt
Another track about romance—not every band can sing about capitalism—but it's just as stuttering and nervy as that last song. Since this one is written by Burt Bacharach, however, it's considerably more melodic.
"It's Now Or Never" by Elvis Presley
 
"Tomorrow will be too late," Elvis impatiently sings over a deceptively mellow beat. Who better than the King himself to remind you that the hour of judgment is approaching?
