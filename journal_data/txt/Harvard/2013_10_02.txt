After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
It seems that a war—or perhaps some sobering economic downturn—has befallen the mythical fantasy land of Elf Power’s discography. Whatever the case, it’s obvious that from their newest offering, “Sunlight on the Moon,” that not all is well in Elf Power’s magical kingdom. Throughout the album, melancholy guitar chords and mournful tinkling pianos back frontman Andrew Rieger’s purposefully languid voice as he sings strikingly personal songs of discontentment that melt into each other in a lackadaisical procession. It’s a very pronounced shift from the playful imagination of the band’s past records. “Sunlight on the Moon” also offers almost no furthering of the fantastical narrative of elves, magical lands and mythical settings started in older albums. Instead, the record concerns itself mostly with internal themes of strife, loneliness and melancholia as well as large-scale issues like war and persecution. It’s an interesting change of pace that at its best produces an album that’s saturated with deeply moody and resonating moments, but regrettably tends to blend together into a lengthy lull of boredom.
With its roots in the indie collective Elephant 6, Elf Power was formed alongside the likes of Neutral Milk Hotel, Of Montreal, and Apples in Stereo in the 1990s. In such company and over the course of their many LP offerings to date, Rieger and instrumentalist Laura Carter have embraced and near-mastered their niche, lo-fi brand of neo-psychedelic rock. “Sunlight on the Moon” offers no change on that front. In fact, the distorted and far-off quality of Rieger’s vocals add to the album’s themes of introspection and solitude. Also constant from Elf Power’s past is their usage of chugging guitar chords and a range of eclectic atypical instruments. This time however, the band is much less playful and upbeat, in keeping with the more brooding themes on “Sunlight on the Moon.”
 
The first song, “Transparent Lines,” immediately sets the tone for the album to follow. In the moody and subdued track, Rieger bemoans inner strife and conflict (“I laid down with the demons in the night and now we’re all the same”) while singing a simple and catchy melody that unfolds in repetitive loops. It’s an excellent track that showcases the band’s new direction in all its angsty and stellar lyricism. Elf Power’s song writing prowess is further demonstrated midway through the album with “Chromosome Blues” and “Grotesquely Born Anew,” a particularly distressed and lonesome track in which Rieger sorrowfully states over the distorted wail of an unrecognizable instrument that “the trail is ending and it never led me home.” The feeling of loneliness is further expounded on in the next track, a melodically pleasing yet downright depressing lament called “Things Lost.”
 
There’s definitely a certain pleasure in listening to each song blend into the next. However, after 13 tracks succeed in this procession, this monotony becomes more grating than soothing. Upon the first listen, a fair number of songs on “Sunlight” sound very similar. Even after a couple of times through it’s still very easy to get lost in the chugging guitar chord blur that is the latter part of the album. At first “Total Annihilation” seems to be a break from the monotony of sad tracks that surrounds it, opening with bombastic garage rock drum rolls and electric guitar riffs, only to eventually settle back into the simple melodies and repetitive guitar chords that dominate “Sunlight.” The track “Manifestations” seems especially unimaginative, with a melody that sounds like a too-familiar mashup of songs played earlier in the tracklist.
 
Being in the middle of such monotony makes “Darkest Wave,” a moody folk-blues hybrid that stands as a unique and strongly crafted track, all the more enjoyable and appreciated. The same goes for “Slow Change,” the album’s strong exceptional closing track. Among a plethora of discontented songs, “Slow Change” seems to be the most likely to find itself at the center of a musical montage of some teen-angst centered indie flick. With Rieger’s slow and mournful delivery, a tapping piano melody and the album’s characteristic strumming guitars, it’s a slow burner and sums up the essence of what “Sunlight” excels in very well.
 
It wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if “Sunlight on the Moon” turned out to be a real darling with the critics. It’s meaningful, dark, well conceived, strongly crafted, and shows a real progression on the band’s part. It’s an album that picks its themes and sticks to them, and perhaps the occasional boredom it induces can be forgiven for its firmness in purpose and skill in lyricism. However, only time will tell if Elf Power’s fans, loyal for almost 20 years, will appreciate the band’s significant turn from their tales about magical kingdoms and fantastical creatures to the gloomy tropes of personal introspection and discontentment. As for newcomers to the band, they’ll be introduced to an Elf Power that isn’t entirely the Elf Power as previously defined. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t an album worth listening to—beneath the occasional surface boredom of the album lie its most rewarding subterranean elements. If listeners agree, it could mean a lasting new direction for the band. If not, "Sunlight on the Moon" will likely be condemned to the category of an interesting, yet ultimately forgettable album.

Normally, it may be considered vain or (more likely) redundant to quote oneself. But, as I scrolled through my Facebook timeline back to freshman year of high school, I realized that I can’t remember what the hell was going through my head at that time. To me, it’s become unrecognizable.
I don’t know why I wanted to share those statuses. Beyond representing a certain multicultural awareness, they just show a drastically misplaced importance for the idiom “you are what you eat.” Plus, I stumbled upon a Facebook note that year entitled “people who are dooshes,” in which I cleverly call people who use laptops at Starbucks and people who Google their names often “dooshes.” To say the least, reading these now is strange. And it makes me feel a bit dooshy.
But I’ve realized that going through them is not so much strange as it is stranger. I can’t recognize the version of me that wrote these. So when reading through my virtual social life, there is a feeling of remoteness—I recognize that I must have changed a lot since then, but I also know that I cannot fully access what was going through my head by reading these old statements of what was “on (my) mind.”
It is rare, but just last month I had that same remote feeling while doing something completely different—reading U.S. News and World Report’s 2014 summary of Harvard College. For the first time since 2008, the magazine ranked Harvard second. I wanted to see why we moved down. So I looked at the report and had that same strange freshman Facebook feeling.
Here’s one sentence from it that may show why: “Although they are no longer recognized by the university as official student groups, the eight all-male ‘final clubs’ serve as social organizations for some undergraduate students; Harvard also has five female clubs.” This was the only sentence about Harvard’s social life, and it’s the type of insight you’d expect from an economist who watched the “The Social Network” once, while playing a drinking game. There is a certain objective accuracy yet total remoteness to it, and that remoteness draws out the subtleties of “objectively” ranking colleges, which make those rankings both extremely important and extremely pointless for top schools.
College rankings traditionally operate the same way that Facebook and “The Social Network” do—making profit through social perception and reputation. Colleges known as the “top schools” get better applicants, which makes them into more selective, better schools. The job market responds accordingly. Alumni money filters back. And the top schools then repeat the cycle, starting from the top. Thus, the reason top schools are top schools is because they are top schools.
When U.S. News and World Report began ranking schools in 1983, the only criteria on which colleges were judged was reputation: what other colleges thought of one another. It was only in recent decades that the magazine tried to make it more “objective,” using other criteria for their rankings such as retention rates (weighted as 22.5 percent), faculty resources (20 percent), student selectivity (12.5 percent), financial resources (10 percent), graduation rate (7.5 percent) and alumni giving rate (5 percent).
At the end of the day though, the rankings really amount to a pseudo-objective reflection of subjective reputation. “Reputation” is still given a large weight in the rankings (22.5 percent). Furthermore, a 2009 study proved that the rankings themselves actually affect schools’ perception of one another. Thus, the rankings affect their own criteria by increasing the reputation scores for schools they already rated highly. This pattern also affects student selectivity and alumni giving rates—higher-level students apply to schools based on U.S. News rankings, and employers give high salaries to alumni from these schools. If that weren’t enough, the already affected alumni giving rate then affects another category: financial resources.
So, the rankings too get caught in a cycle of making “objectively better” schools even more objectively better, and nothing seems to change. In fact, one 2001 paper claimed that only 10 percent of changes in U.S. News and World rankings are due to changes in the quality of the schools; the rest are because of shifts in ranking criteria.
Although Harvard lost its top spot, it really doesn’t have to worry—it’s subjectively, objectively a top school. And because of that, it will stay that way on any mainstream scale. But what will be lost is any insightful description of the qualitative experience that being a student for four years provides, which no reputation in a social network of schools can reflect.
Just as there is more to say about Harvard’s social life than the quantity of its final clubs and there was more to me in 2008 than being a churro, there is much more to say about Harvard’s education than what other people think of it. Most applicants and employers probably already know that. Based on the numbers though, I’m not sure that they know exactly how much more there really is.
But to help out just a bit, I’ll tell you my feeling towards my year or so of education here:
That’s amore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the commissioners on the Cambridge Housing Authority voted 3-1 to ban smoking in public housing buildings, forcing low-income residents to leave the privacy of their own homes before they light up. Public housing buildings are owned by the government, and the government—and that means taxpayers—has the right to make the right to live in public housing conditional upon certain stipulations. That said, this is a serious infringement on the liberty of those who rely on taxpayer assistance for housing. The fact that the ban applies to those from low-income backgrounds makes the new regulation even less tenable, as the Cambridge Housing Authority unfairly makes it such that the prohibition of smoking in one’s own abode only applies to those without the means to independently purchase their own house or apartment.
We believe that individuals have a right over their own bodies, and an outright ban of smoking—other than a Pigovian tax for public health reasons—threatens the relationship between a government and the citizens whose rights it was elected to protect. It becomes especially difficult to support this restriction when all the facts are considered. Many tenants in public housing are elderly, implying that the government has taken the measure that robs these residents of a right they have enjoyed their entire lives.
Certainly, smoking—especially in a densely populated urban area—creates public health concerns, and it is understandable that the Cambridge Housing Authority wishes to establish better living conditions for those who make the conscious decision not to smoke. Yet, as instituted, the ban on smoking in public housing strikes as a simple case of tyranny of the majority.
The Cambridge Housing Authority should instead set up designated non-smoking housing, instead of forcing those who do smoke to leave the confines of their home for the solace of a cigarette.
Those whose circumstances force them to live in low-income housing should be neither punished nor shamed, and it is hard to imagine this restriction acting as anything but a repetitious indication that others have control over such a fundamental aspect of their lives. Everyone has the right to feel at home in his place of residence. This ban threatens that right and reminds those living in public housing that their liberty is in jeopardy on all fronts. Regardless of lung cancer rates, such a menace does not a healthy community make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I experienced what I consider to be my first political confrontation in a locker room at the age of seven. The topic of conversation had turned to television, a subject about which I—having been raised on a fairly limited TV diet of news and documentaries—knew painfully little.  In a concerted effort to avoid awkwardness I remained silent, at least until someone mentioned Fox. Finally, I thought, something to which I can contribute! I eagerly chimed in:
“Yeah, I watch Fox News! And NBC, and CNN, and ABC, and CBS—60 Minutes is awesome!”
One by one, the other girls turned to look at me. Finally, one of them said, voice dripping with contempt, “What are you talking about? Fox isn’t news.”
In retrospect, she was probably referring to the Fox of Family Guy and The Simpsons. But her passing remark shook my seven-year-old worldview and set the groundwork for what would become an ongoing quest to decipher fact from fiction.  In the murky world of politics, I quickly learned I had to formulate stances independent of both my right-wing family and my left-wing friends.
My parents were and are firm believers in evaluating both sides of an issue before forming an opinion. We had no single news channel of choice; each day we’d flip back and forth between several. To me, Fox was just one of many—I had little to no understanding of bias in journalism and was unaware that, especially in my home state of Massachusetts, admitting to watching Fox News was tantamount to blasphemy of the highest order, worthy at least of derision if not outright vitriol.
As I grew older I grew progressively more reserved about my political beliefs. All my politically vocal friends were liberal; they touted their party of choice as being the party of “tolerance,” while in the same breath mocking and dismissing those with whom they disagreed. It wasn’t long before I began to feel that I had to be missing something: If all my friends, whom I knew to be intelligent and rational, saw the same facts but came to conclusions so radically different from mine, I figured there had to be something fundamentally wrong with the way I was approaching and thinking about politics.
Throughout high school I struggled to reconcile my right-of-center political upbringing with the overwhelmingly left-wing culture of the state in which I was born and raised. As I attempted to break away from both sides and form “my own opinions,” what perplexed me were not the varying stances—each group often made valid points—but the ways in which these stances were categorized. I couldn’t bring myself to agree with the Democratic Party’s big-government philosophy but found myself disagreeing just as much with the GOP’s stances on abortion and gay marriage.  My family’s experiences with communism made me skeptical of big government on all fronts, fiscal and social alike; I couldn’t understand how my friends, so vehement about government non-interference in social matters, could simultaneously advocate enormous government spending and regulation.
College was an exciting transition on a number of levels, of course, but I was particularly excited about the chance to join what had to be an engaging and open political discussion on campus. An institution of higher learning that valued diversity of opinion naturally seemed the best place to hone political beliefs and exchange ideas, and I looked forward to the chance to debate with and learn from my peers.
To a certain extent, I wasn’t wrong. There is a vibrant dialogue on campus on all manner of issues—as long as one’s beliefs fall within certain unwritten boundaries. I’m fortunate enough to have an acceptable, libertarian-esque platform, but the ways in which certain viewpoints are treated on campus, implicitly or otherwise, have made me reluctant to voice my own. Although this is no doubt at least somewhat due to cowardice on my part, the overall less-than-tolerant approach to political discussion has made me question how open and accepting the conversation really is.
Developing a set of beliefs is and should be an ongoing process. Being exposed to perspectives from both sides of the aisle beginning at an early age was mostly a blessing. Although it has caused a fair amount of confusion, it’s also given me the opportunity to evaluate various issues from multiple angles. There is value inherent in diversity of opinion, and shutting down certain perspectives runs counter to a culture that purportedly values tolerance and the exchange of ideas.
I’ll never know if the girl in the locker room all those years ago shot me down out of political conviction or—more likely—simply sciolism. But college is a far cry from a bunch of seven-year-olds, and the stakes of tolerance in conversation are significantly higher here. Allowing as many different viewpoints as possible to participate in dialogue is the best way to learn and grow from discussion—whether you watch Fox for the news or just for New Girl.

As anyone who has been following Harvard’s development plans knows, our University does not have a great track record in giving back to the community surrounding its campus. But as Harvard moves forward with its plans to build, among other things, a hotel and conference center in North Allston, it has the responsibility to bring good jobs to the Allston community.
Harvard first announced its plans for major new development in Allston in 1997. After 10 years of planning and eventually breaking ground, Harvard halted construction of its planned Science Complex in 2009 in response to the financial crisis. Now that our Uuniversity’s endowment is steadily climbing again, it has finally decided to move forward with development; last summer, Harvard submitted a revised Institutional Master Plan to the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Harvard’s new IMP looks promising so far. It includes proposals to build a new basketball stadium, a hotel, and a conference center, as well as update and renew existing buildings in the North Allston part of campus. The BRA also mandates that all development plans include a community benefits package designed to mitigate the negative impact of large construction projects on local neighborhoods, and Harvard’s proposed community benefits package now includes such things as streetscape improvements and scholarship programs. These are important ways in which Harvard can give back—but they do not address structural economic issues in Allston. As The Crimson Staff wrote last month, “Harvard’s attempts at providing community benefits have included the Harvard-Allston Education Portal and the construction of a mini-golf course for the use of Allston community members. While education and entertainment are important, residents dealing with business closures, construction sites, and rapidly changing neighborhood demographics deserve benefits related to housing, employment, and transportation.”
The BRA gives community members a 60-day comment period, which has been extended until this Wednesday. Wednesday night, the Harvard Allston Task Force will meet to finalize and submit their comments to Harvard’s revised IMP.
Harvard’s revised IMP states that for the more than 2,500 construction jobs, “Harvard will make reasonable good-faith efforts to have at least 50 percent of the total employee work hours be for Boston residents.” But what about the jobs held by Boston residents after Harvard finishes development? Harvard has leased out space in Allston to tenant businesses like the Boston Boxing Club, creating approximately 390 jobs in the last three years. More than 1,000 new workers will be employed on Harvard’s property in the next 10 years. Will these be sustainable and livable jobs?
Although we don’t know about the working conditions at Boston Boxing Club, we do know about one large commercial property owned by Harvard in Allston: the DoubleTree Hotel, which our University purchased in 2005. Sadly, Harvard has been far from a responsible owner of the DoubleTree. In fact, when a majority of the workers at the DoubleTree petitioned management asking for a fair process to decide on unionization, the hotel’s managers, contracted by Harvard, denied them this process, going as far as retaliating against worker leaders in the hotel, according to a group of employees there. Harvard has failed to ensure that its workers at the DoubleTree are given a fair process for unionization. Workers at Harvard’s hotel also allege that they face unhealthy working conditions. Delmy Lemus, a room attendant at the Doubletree Allston hotel, wrote in a letter to the editor of The Crimson last spring, “When my back was injured because when I was pregnant, my managers continued to assign me the same workload. … I want to be treated like a human being, not just a pair of hands and a back.”
Luckily, Allston community members and Harvard have a way of ensuring that employees at Harvard’s new hotel and conference center will never face the kind of injustice Delmy describes. Good jobs are an important and necessary community benefit. Thus, we ask that Harvard include language in the IMP to ensure that the jobs it brings to Allston are good jobs: jobs in which workers get paid a living wage and have a fair process to decide on unionization. Harvard should guarantee that it will remain neutral on its employees’ choice of union and commit to fair labor practices and a living wage to all employees at Harvard-owned for-profit businesses, as well as at all third-party operators and managers of for-profit businesses that operate under contract with Harvard. The Harvard-Allston Task Force is already aware of the importance of employment issues in Allston, and we hope that this language finds its way into their submitted comments, and then into Harvard’s final IMP.
Harvard should hold jobs in Allston to the same standard that it holds jobs on Harvard’s Cambridge campus.  Harvard has respected previous fair unionization processes at other subcontracted Harvard workplaces before—most notably at the Law School cafeteria—and we believe that this practice should be standard for all Harvard-owned properties.
As a non-profit educational institution, Harvard should have no problem guaranteeing good employment in the neighborhoods that it develops. The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition has asked that Harvard be a responsible owner for all of its directly held properties. Harvard, here’s a good way to start: Include strong language in your IMP guaranteeing good jobs, a community benefit that will truly help support economic development in Allston for years to come.

Scientist Kamaljit S. Bawa and wildlife photographer Sandesh Kadur captured the rich biodiversity of the Eastern Himalaya in a presentation and book signing at the Sackler Museum on Tuesday.
“When you look at books about the Himalaya,” said Bawa, a former fellow at the Kennedy School’s Sustainability Science Program, “they show mostly beautiful landscapes, snow, and ice. What we wanted to document was the richness of life in the Himalaya.”
Five years ago, Bawa and Kadur trekked over 15,000 feet up the Eastern Himalaya, which has been coined a “biodiversity hotspot” by Conservation International. After compiling over 10 terabytes worth of photography, the pair co-authored “Himalaya: Mountains of Life.”
“What we did was we basically took all this research and put it in language that everyone can understand,” said Kadur, a winner of the National Geographic Emerging Explorer Award. “We married that with beautiful photography.”
Kadur said he believes his photography of the Himalayan landscape will captivate readers and encourage them to learn more about the region’s flora and fauna.
“I think it’s very hard for people to contemplate climate change that could be a big change decades away,” said Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Harvard University Office for Sustainability. “So seeing these photos makes it much more tangible today.”
Bawa, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, met Kadur in 2003 after seeing Kadur’s award-winning documentary “Sahyadris: Mountains of the Monsoon.”
Introducing the event, Kennedy School professor William C. Clark said the lecture integrated both arts and science in a way that universities struggle to do.
Bawa and Kadur both said that they hope to help a global audience understand the consequences of human development, and in turn, influence policy regarding environmental sustainability.
“Land use changes by pushing the frontiers of the forest,” Bawa said.
In 1996, Bawa founded the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment. His organization focuses on applied science and how research can affect policy-making in countries like his native India.
According to Bawa, as populations—especially in Asia—continue to swell, governments respond by constructing dams, hydro plants, and other man-made public works projects to support their citizens. India’s government, for example, has devised plans to construct 400 new hydro dams over the next 20 years.
Henriksen said she felt “hopeful” that there were so many students in the audience.
“The young people at this institution [are] going to go out and become global leaders and will really interact and solve these challenges.”

Awaiting the re-opening of Harvard’s Fogg Museum in 2014, Harvard recently launched a digital version of its Art Museums magazine, “Index,” to provide users with updates on the renovation as well as unique daily content.
Jennifer Aubin, an Art Museums spokesperson, said a digital version of “Index” has been on the mind of Art Museums staff for some time.
With its launch, the magazine will essentially combine the efforts of three other publications: the magazine “Next,” which provides information about monetary gifts, the printed museum calendar, and a blog started last summer.
The goal of the publication is “to be able to tell our story and share stories with various audiences, [to] get them engaged,” Aubin stated.
The Harvard Art Museums have been connected online through Facebook for a couple of years, but the addition of a dedicated online magazine adds more features, Aubin said.
With a tiled graphic design, “Index” website displays media and articles chronologically; posts are tagged and easily navigated by subject; and Twitter integration adds additional communication with the staff.
Art Museums Creative Director Steven Waldron, who helped design the magazine, explained that the concept of time played a key role in the aesthetic inspiration.
The landing page of the site cycles through 365 colors, a different one for each day of the year.
Additionally, Waldron said the content is arranged from top to bottom to give a “feeling of ever expanding, ever growing,” creating a virtual index of content.
Between July 18—when the website officially went live—and September 30, “Index” attracted over 6,500 unique visitors and exceeded 10,000 visits in total. Aubin added that the articles detailing information on the renovations have been the most popular.
“We have a pretty big audience we are trying to reach and get them to understand what our activities are,” said Aubin.
From interviews of construction workers to posts of amusing “look-a-like” photographs of staff members and artifacts, the magazine offers many views into the inner workings of the museum.
Aubin, who herself writes news-related announcements for the site, said her favorite thing about it is that “it represents the many voices and projects that happen and exist at the Harvard Art Museums.”
A tri-annual print edition of “Index” will accompany the website and encourage readers to access supplemental information on the website through the use of a smartphone-based technology called Layar.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 7, 2013
An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Harvard Art Museums’ new digital magazine. In fact, it is “Index,” not “The Index.”

Harvard Law School Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 hypothesized that, in the event of an appointment to the Supreme Court in 2016, the judge appointed will be either Asian-American or African-American. This hypothesis came after Tushnet claimed to have accurately predicted the appointment of Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor in 2008.
Tushnet, a former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, made the prediction during a discussion of his new book, “In the Balance: Law and Politics of the Roberts’ Court,” which focuses on the ideological differences between the liberal and conservative factions in the current Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76.
Tushnet predicated his hypothesis on the idea that at least one current justice on the Supreme Court will retire around 2016, a scenario he said was likely given that both Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Justice Antonin G. Scalia will turn 80 in 2016. However, he noted that any election of a liberal justice would be dependent upon the election of a liberal president in 2016.
“[Presidents] use Supreme Court appointments to create a legacy that is comparable to the President’s vision and/or will satisfy various constituents within the party,” he said.
Tushnet added that the appointment of a liberal or conservative Supreme Court judge in 2016 could sway the balance of power enormously within the Court.
In his talk, Tushnet discussed the rationale behind the increasingly ideologically divided opinions on the Supreme Court in recent years, saying that they represent broader divides in the American political system.
“The Supreme Court is generally reflective of what is going on in other parts of the government,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. “The core of the issue for the Court is a competition between a liberal and conservative vision for the national government.”
He further described the current Supreme Court Justices’ voting as falling into a similar pattern, with one bloc voting reliably conservatively, an opposing bloc voting reliably liberally, and one or two swing voters often determining the Court’s final decision.
Ultimately, Tushnet said his book conducts an in-depth investigation of the inner workings of the Court.
“[“In the Balance”] is written for an interested lay audience, that makes technical legal questions accessible to non-lawyers,” he said in an interview with The Crimson.

EdX will now offer its students the option of paying a fee to receive an ID-verified “certificate of achievement” for completing an online course, marking the first time the 17-month-old virtual education nonprofit will monetize its free content.
“Think of it as a premium model,” EdX President Anant Agarwal said of the new initiative Tuesday at an appearance at a Graduate School of Education-sponsored forum.
The new certification process, which is debuting for three edX courses this fall, comes at a time when providers of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, are increasingly thinking about making money from their services.
Students registering for any of the three participating courses are now able to choose from among three possible tracks. They may audit the course for free without the expectation of any certificate, sign up for a free certificate, or pay a fee to receive an ID-verified certificate upon successful completion of class requirements.
Paid certificates cost $25 for Stat2x: “Introduction to Statistics,”  $50 for CS169x: “Software as a Service,” and $100 for 6x: “Circuits and Electronics.”
Students signing up for an ID-verified certificate also have the option of donating more than the minimum fee to support edX—an initiative that Agarwal said has already yielded results.
“When I last looked, the amount of money that was coming in was about 10 percent more than the minimum the student could have paid,” said Agarwal.
Students who cannot afford to pay but wish to receive an ID-verified certificate will have the option of petitioning edX to receive an “honor code certificate.”
Agarwal’s comments about the new certification process came as part of a larger discussion about edX at Tuesday’s forum, which was entitled “EdX: Reinventing Education.” Speaking to a packed audience of Harvard and MIT affiliates and members of the general public, Agarwal presented edX’s mission of improving educational access, quality, and research and sharing its educational tools on an open source platform. Agarwal pointed to the new ID-verified certificates as one of many efforts by edX to make its business model “self-sustaining.”
Another potential revenue-generator, Agarwal said, could be licensing of what he termed “new age textbooks”—digital course materials that could be purchased and used by other instructors.
“Today, I am very comfortable using the textbook from a colleague,” Agarwal said. “Why not use videos or other forms of content? The printed page has been replaced by the multimedia experience from your laptop or whatever else.”
In addition to the new certification process, this fall MITx, MIT’s subset of the larger edX initiative, will launch a collection of courses linked to a particular discipline to offer more depth in a subject area.
The “XSeries” sequences will cover an amount of content equivalent to two to four traditional university courses and take between six months and two years to complete. The two inaugural XSeries sequences, which will launch this fall and next year, will each be divided into short, specific modules without direct on-campus equivalents.
According to HarvardX Faculty Director Robert A. Lue, Harvard’s branch of edX decided at this time not to launch an XSeries because faculty are still debating many questions regarding the execution of such an initiative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences gathered Tuesday for the body’s first meeting of the fall semester to discuss a number of continuing initiatives on campus, including the pending relocation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston, the new Harvard Museums of Science and Culture consortium, and the FAS Dean’s Annual Report for the 2012-2013 academic year.
 
However, the meeting was largely dictated by the presentation of the annual report and varied faculty concerns expressed during lengthy question periods.
 
In the annual report, which was released to the faculty prior to the meeting, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith called FAS’s financial position “precarious” and, along with Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, said that the FAS was looking to the Harvard Campaign for support.
 
Smith focused much of his presentation on the financial difficulties of the 2012-2013 academic year. “All of our funding streams have been under pressure, from what we can do with respect to tuition increases to what the heck is happening down in Washington, D.C. with respect to government funding,” Smith said. Government support for academic research has been reduced under the budget measure known as sequestration, which went into effect in March.
 
But Smith also expressed optimism. He announced that the FAS would launch its segment of the Harvard Campaign—the University’s first capital campaign since 1999—on Oct. 25, and highlighted the importance of the fundraising drive to the future of the FAS.
 
“Significant challenges remain, but there is much to be excited about,” he told the faculty. “The donors and the friends of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are all excited about the future vision that we are painting.”
 
While the annual report was the focus of much of the meeting, it was bookended by lengthy and divergent discussion periods. These included a conversation on House Renewal during which Kirwan, in response to a question from Professor of Mathematics Benedict H. Gross ’71, told the faculty that Stone Hall had come in under-budget, costing the University about $45 million. Kirwan added that the University spent $2.3 million to house students in swing spaces on Mass. Ave, Mt. Auburn St., and Plympton St. during construction.
 
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke also spoke on House Renewal, summarizing the changes made to Quincy’s Stone Hall and thanking his fellow house masters for their support.
 
The meeting’s official question period featured a number of faculty issues unrelated to docketed items.
 
“My question concerns the late [British Prime Minister] Margaret Thatcher who died last April. Will you join me in lamenting and deploring that Harvard never honored her with an honorary degree or in any other way?” said Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, directing his question at University President Drew G. Faust.
 
Mansfield suggested that Thatcher was not awarded an honorary degree because she was a conservative and lamented that Harvard’s Commencement had turned into “a parade of liberals.” Faust responded by encouraging Mansfield to submit nominations to the Committee on Honorary Degrees.
 
Professor of Art and Architecture Jeffrey F. Hamburger raised concerns about a recent report in the Boston Globe stating that the Experiment Fund, a group of venture capitalists who advise and recruit students, has been allowed to use office space in Maxwell Dworkin. “To what extent is this institution willing to pit investment versus inquiry and thereby corrupt and degrade the traditional ideas of a liberal arts education to worship at the altar of Mammon?” he said.
 
Near the end of the meeting, English professor Jorie Graham took to the microphone to encourage the University to establish more professorships in the field of creative writing.
 
Two updates slated for the meeting—related to the relocation of SEAS to Allston and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture—were not discussed on Tuesday due to time constraints and were instead referred by the Docket Committee to the next Faculty Meeting, which is scheduled for Nov. 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a panel discussion Tuesday evening called “Women in the Political Workplace,” panelists including State Representative Majorie C. Decker and visiting professor of government Kay L. Schlozman agreed that, despite its strong liberal political leanings, Massachusetts remains an unequal political environment for women.
The panel was hosted by the Harvard College Democrats and, in addition to Decker and Schlozman, consisted of Megan O. Corrigan ’16—who worked on Elizabeth Warren’s 2012 campaign for Senate—and Stephen Eisele, a program manager at the Parity Project, a non-partisan organization dedicated to electing more women. The panel was moderated by Shauna L. Shames ’01, a PhD candidate in Government.
Decker said that Massachusetts ranks 37th in pay equity and that only a quarter of the Massachusetts State Legislature is female.
“The truth is...the numbers haven’t gotten better,” Decker said.
During the event, panelists discussed potential causes and effects of gender disparity in politics, as well as proposing possible solutions. Some of the panelists pointed to a lack of female political role models as a potential root of the imbalance.
“Men look in the mirror and see a Senator, and women look in the mirror and say ‘I’m not qualified,’” Eisele said, later adding that “once you see female role models in there, [a female] no longer [has] to say I’ll be the first.”
Panelists also pointed to sexism and traditional views of gender roles as obstacles that female politicians must overcome.
During her write-in re-election campaign, Decker recalled critics who challenged her ability to be both a public figure and a mother of two young children.
Corrigan said she was frustrated by a view she heard expressed during Warren’s 2012 campaign, that “a woman could not accomplish as much as a man because of her family duties.”
She added that she thought sexism in the press was a major barrier for women looking to win election.
Schlozman echoed Corrigan’s sentiments.
“Nobody talks about a man’s suit or his haircut,” she said.
Decker said that she thought part of the solution to the gender disparity was to increase the number of women who staff political offices because she said those staffers are more likely to eventually run for political office themselves.
Anna M. Menzel ’15, who attended the event, said that she was glad “to hear encouragement that women can run [for office] and are making a difference.”
Hannah R. Phillips ’15, Vice President of the Harvard College Democrats and the lead organizer of the panel, said that the purpose of the event was to “raise awareness and draw attention to the issue.”
At the end of the meeting, Decker asked how many in the crowd have considered running for office. Eight hands shot up. Four were female.

A computing facility co-founded by Harvard and four other universities in Massachusetts uses outside air to chill its computers, 25 percent recycled content in its building materials, and a hydroelectric power source—features that have earned it national recognition for sustainable design.
The Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center, opened in Holyoke, Mass. in Nov. 2012, has become the first university data center in the nation to receive LEED Platinum certification—the highest green building ranking awarded by the United States Green Building Council—according to a press statement released by the USGBC on Monday.
The building is the “first facility in the nation of its kind,” according to a press release by the MGHPCC, because it brings together academic institutions, private companies, and the Massachusetts state government. Harvard joins MIT, Boston University, the University of Massachusetts system, and Northeastern University in utilizing the center.
“The MGHPCC is a key component of the University’s ongoing green IT and sustainability efforts,” Colin B. Durrant, Harvard’s sustainability communications manager, wrote in an email. “It’s also an excellent example of how Harvard can partner with peer education institutions, government, and business to amplify our impact.”
Computing and data centers require “intensive energy and water needs,” Rick Fedrizzi, president and CEO of the USGBC, said in a press release. Durrant also noted that Harvard’s investment in research can often take place in facilities with immense greenhouse gas emissions, an energy cost the University is trying to reconcile with its commitment to sustainability.
A Green Information Technology sub-committee has been meeting regularly to develop “guidelines and recommendations reducing energy and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the University’s IT infrastructure,” wrote Durrant. The MGHPCC is one of “the highest profile examples” of the sub-committee’s efforts.
The USGBC developed the LEED system to rate buildings on their environmental performance. Platinum is the highest rating, followed by Gold, Silver, and Certified. In addition to its cooling efficiency systems and renewable energy sources, the MGHPCC was recognized for features such as cooling fans that change speed depending on the temperature and building chillers that only run at off-peak hours.
The computer center helps researchers at Harvard and other institutions “break new ground in understanding the mysteries of our world and universe,” Fedrizzi said. “It is only fitting that the center is also on the cutting edge of sustainability.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty members on Tuesday condemned the politics leading to the budget gridlock that caused the U.S. government to shut down parts of its machinery for the first time in nearly two decades.
Speaking in interviews, professors said they believed the current crisis is a symptom of broader governmental dysfunctionality undermining the functioning of American democracy.
“I’m furious. Unless the country finds a way to address [dysfunctionality] in a systematic way, we’re really hampered in our ability to function as a country,” government professor Robert H. Bates said. “I’m very discouraged.”
Government professor Beth Ann Simmons put it more bluntly: “The United States government is the epicenter of government dysfunctionality,” she said.
Many non-essential parts of the governmental machinery ground to a halt Tuesday after the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House failed to reach a new budget agreement before the end of the day on Monday. The impasse has already furloughed about 800,000 federal workers and closed down national parks, monuments, and museums, and is expected to impact research, student loans, and visa sponsorship.
The shutdown came as no surprise to many professors who anticipated this climax of weeks-long partisan disagreement over the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s signature healthcare law which began to take effect Tuesday despite the protestations of many Republicans.
“I expected it to happen,” said visiting professor of economics Jeffrey Zabel. “I think that holding the government hostage because you don’t happen to believe in a law that was passed is ridiculous.”
House Republicans opposed to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act have passed three bills that would enable essential federal funding while delaying the implementation of the healthcare law for another year.
However, the Democrats in the Senate shot down all three variations of the spending agreement, refusing to vote for a measure that would delay the implementation of the ACA.
Professors disparaged the inability of Congress to come to a compromise, particularly the refusal of many House Republicans to accept the ACA as a law.
“I believe it’s a publicity stunt in the worst possible way for a group of people to basically say, ‘We don’t like the Affordable Care Act,’” Medical School professor Sharon-Lise T. Normand said. 
“I hope that the populace gets pissed off and kicks the Tea Party out of office,” Zabel said, alluding to the populist political movement that counts among its members many of the House Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act.
The current government shutdown, the first in 17 years, marks the culmination of heated debate about the appropriate degree of government involvement in the lives of citizens.
The Affordable Care Act, which aims to extend health insurance to nearly all Americans by requiring most uninsured citizens to purchase a healthcare plan, has polarized Congress since it was first passed in March 2010. While proponents applaud the law for providing nearly universal affordable health care, critics say that the law unfairly mandates citizens and companies to pay for a program they do not want.
Normand, who said she was “disgusted with the behavior of the people in Washington,” said she expects the shutdown will not adversely affect the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
“I hope there will be no implications [from the shutdown], and I’m not sure there will be because there’s not much that can be done—the law is there,” Normand said.
Most professors said they believe the government will be back up and running within the next couple of weeks and hope representatives in Congress can work towards bipartisanship.
“The old-guard Republicans are rolling over in their graves,” Zabel said. “They understand politics is all about compromise, and we have this unprecedented situation where one side in particular doesn’t believe in compromise, which makes it difficult to undertake politics as we know it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust criticized President Barack Obama’s proposal to tie federal financial aid to government-created college rankings, a legislative goal that Obama has championed as a key step to making college more affordable.
“One of the general and widespread responses in higher education to this proposal has focused on what are we trying to measure and how [we] understand what a good education is,” Faust said in an interview with The Crimson last month. “And some of the kinds of criteria that have been identified are quite troubling to many of us.”
Obama’s proposal, intended to alleviate student debt and make colleges accountable for their costs, involves rating and ranking peer institutions based on tuition levels, graduation rates, graduate debt and earnings, proportion of low-income students, and other factors. From there, pending the passage of legislation in Congress, the rankings would determine the proportion of federal financial aid—in the form of grants and loans–that is disbursed to colleges.
In a speech in August, Obama said that he hoped to begin rating colleges before the 2015 school year and attaching federal aid to those ratings in 2018.
Calling the ratings approach “misguided,” Faust said that evaluating colleges based on the initial earnings and job placement of graduates would undermine the push for college graduates to enter less lucrative fields, such as education and public service. She added that the value of an undergraduate education may only emerge later in a graduate’s life, with many jobs occupied by today’s generation of college graduates yet to be created.
“We should be thinking more about an education of quality, substance, and purpose,” she said. “Not simply about vocation.”
She added that a liberal arts education in particular has value that is not measurable with the metrics that Obama has proposed using.
“I’m a firm believer in the liberal arts...commitments to citizenship [are] part of that framework of education that I don’t think we can easily translate into a measurement,” Faust said.
In addition to Faust and other leaders in higher education who have criticized Obama’s plan, many lawmakers have also opposed the plan. It would likely face an uphill battle in Congress. And even if the plan were to become law, it may not affect Harvard and many of its peer institutions.
In February 2012, Vice President Joe Biden told The Crimson that a system tying federal funding to financial aid would be unlikely to affect Harvard, considering the University’s large financial aid gifts.
“You’re safe at Harvard,” Biden said on a conference call.
Nevertheless, a Harvard spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that the University administration would keep an eye on any relevant legislative updates.
“We are closely following developments in Washington and speaking with policymakers to ensure that any new federal system of ratings reflects the full range of educational benefits a student receives when he or she pursues a college degree,” the statement said.
The interview with Faust was not the first time that she has expressed concerns with Obama’s plan. Faust cited similar objections to the ratings system and associated college scorecard website in a letter to the editor published in The New York Times in February.
“Making college more affordable for students and families is a fundamental goal that we in higher education are dedicated to support,” Faust wrote. “When we decide what to measure, we signal what counts. Equating the value of education with the size of a first paycheck badly distorts broader principles and commitments essential to our society and our future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, the Harvard men’s soccer team emerged from non-conference play in a very similar position to last year’s squad.
Both teams took a beating early in the season, suffering from an inability to get on the board. Last year, the start of Ivy League play marked a turning point that the Crimson was unable to capitalize on, falling flat as it failed to pick up a single win against its Ancient Eight opponents.
As Harvard prepares to take on Yale this weekend in its first Ivy contest of the 2013 season, it has the opportunity to start over with a clean slate. Though troubling in terms of exposing certain weaknesses, the Crimson’s losing preseason will have no bearing on its shot at the Ivy Crown.
With a new coach at the helm and a fresh class of rookies, Harvard’s chances at the outset look markedly better than they did last year.
After winning the Ivy League title in 2009, former coach Carl Junot’s unsuccessful tenure doomed the Crimson to finish no higher than sixth in the conference.
However, following the 2012 season, Harvard looked to shake things up with the hiring of Pieter Lehrer from the University of California, Berkeley.
Through eight non-conference games, Harvard currently has a 1-5-2 record and did not pick up a win until its sixth game after opening the season on a three-game losing streak. Last season’s non-conference record was 1-5-1. With the exception of a 6-0 rout at the hands of No. 2 Connecticut, however, the 2012 squad held its opponents to low scoring victories, taking two of its first eight into double overtime.
This season, the defense is at it again, keeping the team in games that could have easily gotten away. Last weekend, Harvard went down, 1-0, in the ninth minute before locking down to play 80 minutes of scoreless, competitive soccer behind the acrobatic goaltending of sophomore Evan Mendez and senior Brett Conrad. The Crimson goalkeepers rank first in the league with 35 saves, and Harvard is third in the league with two shutouts.
Where the Crimson has truly struggled to find its own is on the offensive end of the ball, despite a talented midfield that sets up opportunity after opportunity.
Going into Ivy League play this weekend against Yale, Harvard ranks fourth in the league in shots, but sits seventh in goals per game.
Watching Harvard play does not feel like watching a losing team. In its home games this season, the Crimson has dominated possession and strung together sustained periods of attack. Countless chances within the six-yard line have fallen short, as headers wide and shots off-target have doomed Harvard to just 0.8 goals per game.
But if Harvard keeps setting up the opportunities, the shots eventually have to start falling. The Crimson is aggressive on offense and has no problem possessing and advancing the ball. Harvard leads the Ivy League in earning 5.71 corner kicks per game, but has been unable to finish. Given the Crimson’s defensive prowess, just one or two of those set pieces falling could be the difference between a win and a loss.
Entering Ivy League play this weekend, the Crimson is not the only team that has taken a beating. Though Dartmouth is undefeated and Columbia and Cornell have five and six victories to their name, respectively, the success stops there. No other Ancient Eight team has more than two wins, and two teams, Penn and Yale, have more losses than Harvard.
The difference will be in finishing those chances. Right now, the Crimson is knocking at the door, and there are some strong contributors early in the season.
Senior defender Ross Friedman leads the team with 17 shots, but only five on goal. Harvard’s limited offensive output has come from a variety of sources, with each of its six goals being chipped in by a different player.
The Crimson has looked to its freshman class to improve and adjust to the college game during non-conference play. Rookie forward Ashi Geberkidane has been a presence up front. He has started all eight games and is second only to Friedman with 10 shots on the season.
With a new coach and new personnel, there is no reason why the 2013 team has to fall like the 2012 team did. The adjustments that need to be made are well within reach for this squad, which excels on defense and keeps itself in games until the very end.
Yes, the Harvard men’s soccer team has problems that it must resolve in order to be competitive in the Ivy League. But they’re the right problems to have.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of a slow start to the season, the Harvard women’s soccer team has picked up the pace, earning its fifth consecutive victory with a win at Central Connecticut State on Sunday evening.
After falling in its first two games of the season in California, the Crimson returned back East in hopes of turning things around on its own turf. After losing its home game opener to New Hampshire, 2-1, it looked as if the Harvard squad was falling quickly down a slippery slope. In its first three contests, despite dominating possession, the Crimson offense failed to connect on goal. Harvard tallied a whopping 21 shots against the Wildcats—12 of which were on frame—yet somehow only managed to net just a single goal. New Hampshire, on the other hand, had only two shots on net and converted on both against the Crimson.
Harvard was controlling possession—sometimes even dominating play—but the team was not winning. Missed opportunities added up against the Crimson in its first three matches.
But the losing streak was near its end. Although Harvard did not clinch a victory in its fourth match—a 1-1 stalemate versus Providence—the team managed to break the curse. Again, despite an even score, the Crimson outnumbered the Friars in shots, 26-10. Placement proved to be an issue for Harvard, as the Providence goaltender added 11 saves to her repertoire by the end of the night.
With a stacked recruiting class and returning lead scorer junior Meg Casscells-Hamby, Harvard promised a positive start to the season—heading winless into its fifth game was definitely not part of the game plan.
So when the Crimson headed into a week of three home games, the team’s physical and mental strength was tested. Once Harvard snagged its first season win against LIU Brooklyn, 1-0, the squad was finally able to translate its ball possession to the scoreboard.
Since that first win, the Crimson is undefeated, notching an impressive 12 goals and only allowing one goal against over the span of five games. And while its victories over LIU Brooklyn, Rhode Island, and UMass Lowell bettered the team’s overall record, the most notable win came against Penn, by a score of 2-1, in Harvard’s first Ivy League match.
The new class of nine freshmen were said to have integrated quickly into the Crimson lineup, but perhaps the first win against the Blackbirds marked the moment when the team finally meshed as a whole. Two of its three goals against LIU and Rhode Island came from rebounded offensive shots, demonstrating the squad’s shift towards capitalizing on its opportunities.
The freshmen have stood out offensively and defensively in the team’s recent surge.
On the defending end, rookie defender Bailey Gary has started in each of Harvard’s nine contests. Gary’s speed has proved to be crucial to the Crimson defense, particularly on the wings. Her composure on the back line has allowed the freshman defender to play to outside midfielders’ feet rather than losing possession from a frantic long kick into pressure or out of bounds. The defender has even registered eight shots on goal this season.
Forward Midge Purce leads Harvard in goals and points with five and eleven, respectively. The freshman has notched two game-winning goals. Her trademark is her quick and dexterous footwork, which often leaves two or even three defenders in the dust. Often attacking from the corners, Purce likes two split two defenders and take the ball inside the 18-yard box for a shot.
Other notable freshmen standouts include goalkeeper Lizzie Durack, forward Karly Zlatic, and forward Joan Fleischman. Durack has seen action in four games, starting in two, and achieved two shutouts this season against LIU Brooklyn and CCSU. Zlatic and Fleischman have pocketed two and one goal, respectively. Zlatic follows Purce in points, registering four for the season.
While the freshmen have stolen much of the spotlight, veteran Crimson players remain essential in each zone of the field.
Co-captain Peyton Johnson has displayed her usual playmaking skills as both a midfielder and a defender this season, starting all nine games and leading the team in assists. The team’s other co-captain, forward Lizzy Weisman, has notched a goal and an assist of her own.
The defense is led by junior defender Erika Garcia and junior goalkeeper Bethany Kanten. Garcia has started in each of the season’s matches thus far, and Kanten has grabbed four starts of her own in goal.
With a five-game win streak going and an untarnished Ivy Record thus far, Harvard has the momentum it needs heading into its match against Yale on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four members of the Harvard women’s tennis team made their first national championship appearances this past weekend at the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships in Pacific Palisades, Calif.  For rookies June Lee, Monica Lin, and Spencer Liang, the tournament was only the second of their college career.
Joined by sophomore Amanda Lin, the four competed in the pre-qualifying doubles draw of the tournament with Amanda Lin paired with Lee and Monica Lin playing with Liang. Both pairings won their opening matches of the tournament before falling in the second round. Not only was this weekend one of the first major tournaments for the three rookies, it was the first time playing together for both doubles pairs.
“It is always a crapshoot when you have a new team playing together in a big tournament like this one,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Our team is just so flexible, I’m very pleased with the way our young squad competed this past weekend.”
Monica Lin and Liang started the tournament with a signature victory for Harvard, winning, 8-6, over the fifth seed, juniors Giuliana Olmos and Zoe Scandalis of USC.
Not to be outdone, Amanda Lin and Lee earned a first-round win over the No. 1 doubles pair from Virginia, freshman Marie Faure and senior Caryssa Peretz, by a score of 8-5.
After their first round upset, Liang and Monica Lin did not advance any further in the tournament—falling, 8-6, to sophomore Ines Deheza and freshman Rutuja Bhosale from Texas A&M. Amanda Lin and Lee suffered a similar fate, losing to Clemson sophomores Jessy Rompies and Romy Koelzer by a final score of 8-4.
Overall, the prestigious tournament served as added experience for a young Harvard squad that boasts four sophomores and four freshmen out of a total roster of 11.
“They really made a statement out there at All-Americans,” Green said. “This weekend definitely gives our team a lot of confidence, especially the younger players, and we hope to build some momentum from the tournament.”

Senior safety Jaron Wilson ignited the Harvard football team on Saturday at Soldier Field, intercepting Brown’s quarterback Patrick Donnelly and returning the ball 51-yards for the score. Wilson’s touchdown sent the Crimson sideline into a frenzy and putting the home team up 21-13. The touchdown broke the game open, allowing Harvard’s high powered offense to take over and coast from there to a 41-23 win. For his performance, Wilson earned our Athlete of the Week honors. Here are some other athletes that performed well over the week:

Viktor Wrobel, Men’s Water Polo
The Harvard Men’s Water Polo team continued its strong play this weekend, sweeping Connecticut, Brown, and MIT. Freshmen attacker Viktor Wrobel amassed eight goals in the two days, with a team high five against MIT. Wrobel also posted two steals against Brown, in a game that was tied heading into the third frame.
Vivianna Hanley, Women’s Cross Country
 
Junior Vivianna Hanley continued her strong start to the season on Saturday, placing first for Harvard and 14th overall at Virginia’s Panorama Farms invitational. Hanley ran the 5k in 17:25.3, which was 31 seconds faster than her previous time. Hanley helped the Crimson place fourth out of the competitive 14-team field.
Eric Medes, Harvard Football
 
Sophomore Eric Medes led the Crimson defense with 10 total tackles, one pass break up, and a quarterback hurry that led to an interception on Saturday. The linebacker was a force in the middle, a key reason why the Harvard defense was able to limit Brown to only 137 rushing yards, after the Bears had rushed for 268 yards the week before. Medes was on the field practically the entire game, starting at linebacker, and also appearing on kickoffs and extra points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a game in which the own goals outnumbered the goals scored, the Harvard women’s soccer team (4-3-1, 1-0 Ivy) managed to grind out a win against Penn (4-1-2, 0-1 Ivy) to open up Ivy League play on Friday at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
The go-ahead goal for the Crimson came in the 79th minute off of a free-kick from just inside half field by freshman forward Midge Purce, who leads the team with nine points this season. Purce drilled the ball towards the Quakers’ goal and found the back of the net as it bounced off a Penn defender. The goal was ruled an own goal, the second of the night.
Earlier in the 67th minute, a seemingly simple cross to the box by Penn caused a miscommunication in the Harvard defense, ending in an own goal, as sophomore defender Alika Keene tried to boot the ball out of the defensive third.
“It didn’t really matter how it went in,” co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson said. “All that mattered was we were a goal back and we had to score.”
Though the goal certainly seemed as if it would deflate the Crimson, the squad responded with defensive pressure and offensive urgency.
“We’ve been in that position many times before, so we knew that in order to win, instead of dwell on that goal, we had to come back,” co-captain forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “It’s the way that you react to that goal that matters, and we took it on ourselves to change the score.”
Early in the match, junior defender Marie Margolius played a beautiful ball to Weisman, who was able to beat the Penn goalie, but had her shot turned away by Quaker defender Claire Walker.
Harvard dominated possession for the majority of the match and did not allow Penn a single shot on goal in the first half. In the 57th minute, Purce sent one over the bar with time and room in front, as the Crimson’s offensive woes continued. Though Purce and fellow freshman forward Joan Fleischman were able to beat their defenders down the wing, Harvard was unable to connect on balls inside the box. Nonetheless, the Crimson defense held the Quakers to a mere four shots in the game, with not one hitting the frame.
The defense continued to pressure and push the ball forward, outhustling Penn to nearly every 50/50 ball. Juniors Cheta Emba, who started, and Bethany Kanten, who was credited with the win, split time in net. The only shot on frame came from the Harvard own goal in the second half.
“We might not have been playing the best that we [have] before, but we had a lot of effort out there, and we just had to calm down and play our game, and I think we did that in the second half,” said Weisman.
The Crimson broke through for its first goal of the night in the 75th minute, when Johnson crossed the ball to Keene, who found freshmen forward Karly Zlatic, as Zlatic calmly put the ball in the back of the net. Johnson was the key distributor for the Crimson all night, providing them with a crucial spark in a game, just when the game looked out of reach.
“We weren’t flowing like I know we can, but I think that what we definitely showed even when things aren’t going perfectly smooth for us, there is a lot of determination,” Johnson said. “When we went down a goal, I don’t think a single person on our team put down their head. We responded very quickly and were able to pull out a win.”
Harvard’s advantage in possession time wore down the Quakers’ offensive players, who were unable to make runs late in the game. Notable Crimson defenders in the match included junior Erika Garcia and freshman Bailey Gary who stepped up, showing good speed and poise with the ball in the back.
“It feels awesome,” Weisman said. “It sets the tone for the rest of the Ivy League. It’s great for us to get that first win, so now we know what that feeling is like, and we want to have that feeling the rest of the season.”
The win marks Harvard’s fourth consecutive victory in the season and its first in the Ivy League.
“That’s a big confidence builder to be able to go down in Ivy League play where teams are very tough to score on, and that’s a really good feeling,” Johnson said. “We didn’t play our best, but with the desire that we had, I don’t know if we were going to be denied.”

If you’re like me, you need a study break at least every two hours to keep from breaking down in hysterics when that kid one cubicle over taps his pen one more time. Here are seven ideas for breaking up your workload.
 
1. Middle School Throwback
Blast “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” from your iPod (we know it’s there), and prank call that hottie you’ve been eyeing in your econ section:
 
You: “Hello there, is your refrigerator running?”Hottie: “...Yeah”You: “YOU BETTER GO CATCH IT! Hehehe!”
Sour Punch Straws and S’mores Pop Tarts encouraged.
 
2. Exercise
Just kidding—lol.
 
3. Climb a Tree
When was the last time you climbed a tree? Change out of your skinny jeans (seriously, this is crucial), and channel your inner squirrel.
 
4. Eat a Healthy Snack 
Kidding again. Independent research (done by yours truly) has concluded that foods that will increase your focus for that Gen Ed reading you really don’t care about include: Swedish Fish, french fries, caramel macchiatos and fro yo.
 
5. Prank your Friends  
Take yourself out of your own misery by putting someone else in theirs. 
Change the autocorrect on your friend’s phone (Settings-->General-->Keyboard-->Add New Shortcut) so that “Ok” becomes “babycakes,” “hey” turns into “hola muthafu***,” and “what” corrects to “$waggy.” Giggle softly while peeping through through library stacks as your friend struggles to text his or her frisky Friday hookup. 
To mess with lots of people, stick a sign to a printer in Lamont that says “This printer is now voice activated,” giving new instructions on how to use the printer.
 
6. Pimp My Wall 
It’s time to say goodbye to that Heineken flag you’ve proudly flown since freshman year (you 18-year-old rebel, you) and revamp your space. Remember that crayon drawing from your 5-year-old cousin you didn’t have the heart to throw away? So avant garde! Shred a poster or a photo or your history notes and tape the pieces back on your wall. Play Modest Mouse and get artsy.
 
7. EDP 
Emergency Dance Parties are appropriate at all hours of the day. First, run into Lamont and tell your friends that Miley Cyrus or someone of comparable status and/or twerking ability is outside and dying to meet them. When they follow you out, scream “EDP!” and crank up the jams.
EDP Playlist:
“Hey Ya!” by Outkast
“I Love It (feat. Charli XCX)” by Icona Pop
“Stayin’ Alive” by Bee Gees
“Turn All The Lights On” by T. Pain feat. Ne-Yo
“U Can’t Touch This” by M.C. Hammer
“Cotton Eye Joe” by Rednex
Major snaps if you can make your friends stay for longer than these six songs or gather random people to boogie with you.
Now get back to work!

 On Monday, you no doubt received but did not actually read an email from Jay M. Harris, Dean of Undergraduate Education and Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee. While its title may have tricked you into thinking it was a guide to actually getting work done when you live in a tiny Wigg suite with four other girls, it was in fact yet another reminder that students at Harvard have cheated.
 Included in the email was an invitation to an Oct. 10 event on academic integrity that will no doubt make you feel guilty of cheating—regardless of whether you have or not—and four questions about the importance of academic integrity. I didn’t know the answers to any of them, so I did what any other Harvard student would do: I collaborated with my classmates. Unfortunately, they were useless, as were Google, my dad, Siri, my first cousin once removed, Wikipedia, and the card-swiper at brain break. Alas, I was left to answer the questions for myself:
“How do we craft a robust culture of integrity at Harvard College?”Good to know that Dean Harris also feels the need to throw in SAT words to make himself sound smarter. Does using a thesaurus count as academic dishonesty?
“What recognition and rewards matter to us?”Noch’s and Insomnia. Why else do you think we participate in so many clubs?
 
“What distracts us from doing right?”The dining hall panini maker being broken for an entire week, having to sleep in a bunk bed, almost getting hit by bicyclists in the Yard, emails from deans asking us broad, abstract questions…
 
“Why do our residential community, the academic disciplines, and the professions depend on integrity?”Because our tutors live four floors below us, we have take home exams, and there are always incredibly naive twin rowers just waiting for us to steal their ideas.
Now that we have that covered, couldn’t someone have told Dean Harris that piling four rhetorical questions on top of one another isn’t the best way to get a college student’s attention on a Monday morning?

With punch season now in full swing, it’s time to present the results of Flyby’s first-ever Final Club Survey. The online survey was emailed out last month to 4,838 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and was partially or fully completed 1,927 times (though it should be noted that individuals could have taken the survey more than once). In the second installment of a six-part series on the survey results, we take a look at the demographics of the self-identified final club members who answered our questions.
Whether or not they’re in a final club or only entered the Owl once to use the bathroom, most Harvard students are familiar with the stereotype of the final club bro.
They’re supposedly white, straight, rich, legacy varsity athletes—but do these stereotypes actually hold up to scrutiny?
The results served up only a few curveballs.
METHODOLOGY
When asked about their final club membership status, 21 percent of survey respondents said they currently belong to a final club, 7 percent said they previously belonged to a club but have since left, 30 percent said they have been punched but did not or have not yet joined a club, and 42 percent said they have never been punched by a club.
For the purposes of our analysis, the answers of respondents who identified as current final club members were then compared to those of respondents who said they have never been punched by a club.
ETHNICITY
Respondents who identified as current members of a final club were more likely than respondents of any other club membership status to say they are white. Seventy percent of final club members identified as white, compared to 63 percent of respondents who said they were never punched by a final club.
SEXUALITY
Final club members were also more likely than respondents of any other club membership status to say they are heterosexual. Ninety-five percent of respondents who said they belong to a final club identified as heterosexual, compared to 87 percent of those who said they had never been punched by a club. 
VARSITY ATHLETE STATUS
People who said they are currently in final clubs were more likely to identify as current or former varsity athletes by a large margin: 44 percent of self-reported club members said they are or were varsity athletes, compared to 16 percent of respondents who said they had never been punched.
LEGACY STATUS
Final club members are apparently more likely to be legacies than those who aren’t. Twenty-four percent of respondents who said they are in final clubs reported that one or both of their parents had attended Harvard College, compared to just 13 percent among those who said they had not been punched.
FAMILY INCOME LEVEL
Wealthy students also appear to be disproportionately represented in final clubs. And while 26 percent of those respondents who indicated that they are current final club members reported a combined parental income of more than $500,000 a year, only 11 percent of respondents who said they had never been punched said they were within the highest combined parental income bracket.
RE-EXAMINING THE STEREOTYPES
But look a little closer, and the stereotypes break down, if only a little bit.
Not all final club members are white. Black and African-American respondents, for example, disproportionately reported being current members of a final club. Respondents who said they were Asian or Hispanic/Latino, however, were under-represented among current final club members. Among survey respondents who identified as current final club members, African-Americans formed the largest minority group, representing 14 percent of the group, while Hispanics/Latinos and Asians trailed with 8 and 7 percent, respectively.
In comparison, Harvard-reported data shows that African-Americans make up 11 percent of the Class of 2017, while Asian-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos make up 20 and 12 percent respectively. (Members of the Class of 2017 were not polled in Flyby’s final club survey.)
Finally, not all club members are rich, either. Forty-four percent of self-identified final club members reported that they receive financial aid from the College and 21 percent reported a combined parental income of less than $80,000 a year.
TAKEAWAYS
Responses to our survey suggested that final club members are disproportionately white, straight, and wealthy. They’re also apparently more likely than their peers who have never been punched to be legacies or to play (or have played) a varsity sport at Harvard. But not all the stereotypes seem to hold up: African-Americans were disproportionately represented among self-identified final club members who responded to our survey, and almost half of responding final club members said they are on Harvard financial aid.
When should I start working on my essays?
While there is no “right time” to start working on essays, it does make sense to start at least thinking about the topic you want to talk about well before December. Writing good essays takes time, and typically, you want to leave time for revisions. Having multiple people look at your essay can be a great idea, too, so you can get feedback on how best to revise your essay. So while there is no right time to start working on your essays, starting earlier, not necessarily in the writing process but just in the thinking process, is hugely valuable.
The thought of all of these applications is really overwhelming. Do you have any organizational tips?
Because students typically apply to so many schools these days, not pacing your work will mean digging a huge hole for yourself once deadlines start rolling around. Once you have a fixed list of all the colleges you will be applying to, create a document with all of the different essay prompts divided by school. You can use this to jot down ideas for possible topics, as well as to keep track of your progress—color-code the document according to whether each essay is completed, in progress, or not yet started. Having a list of all of the essay topics means that you can more easily see similarities between different schools’ applications. Seeing what you can reuse and recombine has the potential to drastically cut down your workload and your stress. Applying to colleges is a feat of organization as much as anything else—starting early, setting concrete milestones for yourself, and keeping careful track of how much work you still have to do will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.
 If I have a low AP score (say, a 3), do I still have to report it? 
Whether or not a school wants you to exercise so-called “score choice”—the ability to cherry-pick which scores to send to schools and which to keep buried in the deepest recesses of a College Board server somewhere—depends on the school. For example, some schools that respect score choice include Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown (although if the tone of their website is any indication, a bit begrudgingly), and MIT. However, it is important to note that the following schools want you to send all of your scores: Yale (students who wish to use their SAT I results must send in all of their SAT I results but needn’t send in their ACT results, and vice-versa. However, if students wish to have both tests considered, all scores from both exams must be sent), University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell. Caltech and Amherst say they “recommend” sending all scores, but stop just short of using the word "require."
Am I too old for Harvard?
According to administrators  across Harvard's schools, there is no age limit. People of any age can  apply, be it to the College, the Medical School, the Extension School,  etc. As Marlyn E. McGrath, the director of Harvard College admissions, said in a 2011 Crimson article: “We  have no age limits. We’re really looking at individuals on the basis of  individual achievement and personal characteristics.”
To protect the author's privacy, the Admissions Blog has granted her anonymity for this series. Read Part I here. 
Mid-April 2009 found my mother and me poring over college brochures, checking train times, and calling up relatives. Really, it was mostly my mom. I was too busy reading admission statistics in three-inch thick college guidebooks to bother with the minutiae of interstate transportation. Our plan was to take the Amtrak between cities for a few days, stopping at all the colleges I wanted to visit.
Day 1: Yale
“You go to Yale?” the cab driver asked me, en route from the train station to campus. “No,” my mother answered on my behalf, “but maybe next year!” It was only my second college tour—I’d looked at Amherst over February break and had been dismayed by the sub-zero wind chill in Western Massachusetts—so I was only partially sure what to expect.
My mom and I were just entering Yale’s information session when we heard a voice call her name. She looked around. It was coming from a man her age, burly, balding and excitedly waving. She looked at him blankly. He gave his name, and recognition dawned on her face. “Oh my God,” she whispered to me. “He was my boyfriend for the first few weeks of college!” She hadn’t recognized him—he’d changed more over the years than she had—but went through the obligatory pleasantries with his wife and two children, the older of whom was a boy my age who was also interested in Yale. We sat down. This was going to be a most interesting day.
Day 2: NYU, Columbia, and Barnard
Could we do three colleges in a day? Did it matter? After finishing up at Yale and taking the train to New York that same afternoon, we crashed at my grandparent’s apartment for the night and woke up the next morning to ride the subway down to NYU. First impression of our tour guide: She looked like a red-haired Kristen Stewart! I was immediately impressed with NYU. The spell started to wear off when I saw a 100-square foot double bedroom, though, and by the end of the day the lack of a campus and hectic atmosphere had me disillusioned.
A few hours later, we found ourselves at Columbia. Immediate impression:  imposing yet calm. Did I want a Core Curriculum? Did I even know what that meant? With barely any time to think, we went off to another information session and tour at Barnard, right across the street. There was only one other student in the small information session. We were, it turned out, slight acquaintances from camp years before. Surprise reunion #2 of the trip! After the tour, we met up for a few minutes with my second cousin, a Barnard freshman, and then returned to my grandparent’s house for a night of family and sleep before hightailing it to Philadelphia the next day.
Day 3: UPenn
The day dawned with near-disaster. We woke up late (or took too long on our morning run…) and dashed to the train. “You go upstairs, I’ll go downstairs!” my mom yelled, deciding it was more efficient to split up to find our train. After fifteen minutes of running through Penn Station, we finally located it and boarded with only a few minutes to spare. Muttering recriminations at each other—“You’re so bad at directions!” “No, you are!”—we settled in, breathless and tired.
Luckily for our nerves, the rest of the day went smoothly. We arrived in Philly, dropped our bags at our hotel, and went off to the Penn campus, perfectly on time for our tour. I met up with two friends from home I’d known would be on the tour, and also bumped into a friend from synagogue I hadn’t seen in a while. We sat on the Ben Franklin statue and asked important questions about the quality of dining hall food. We went running along the old industrial shores of the Schuylkill River, had dinner with a cousin who’d gone to Penn, and returned to our hotel.
Day 4: Princeton
We were finally heading north towards home, but first had to stop off in Princeton for the last leg of our tour. I was put off the school from the start. Maybe it was too many days of travelling, too many identical information sessions, or just the horrendously annoying tour guide who kept tripping over her flip-flops as she did the ubiquitous backwards walk. For intuitive yet superficial reasons, I wrote Princeton off from the start. That didn’t stop me from buying a T-shirt – Go Tigers! – but when we sat down for dinner with more cousins, these ones a Princeton professor and his daughter, I could have cared less when they warned me how competitive admissions were.
As we sped home on the train that afternoon, I reflected on our hectic past few days of college tours. Out of the schools I’d visited so far, Columbia was my favorite. There were many more I’d see in the coming months with my father: Brandeis, where my dad creepily peered through the window of his freshman dorm room; BU and Harvard, where the two of us arrived on bikes, sweaty and decidedly out of place among the suit-wearing prospective foreign students; Wesleyan, where I bumped into another friend from camp on a sweltering late August morning; and Brown, where even the steep campus hills couldn’t dissuade me from falling in love. I sat in on a class at Tufts, flew to D.C. and St. Louis to see GWU and WashU, and, finally, was done with tours.
It was application time.
