After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Yesterday we took a look at the matchup between Alexandra Kiefer and Josephine Pucci. Now, we turn our attention to our third showdown on the women’s side: lacrosse's Jennifer VanderMeulen v. golf's Bonnie Hu.
Attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen — 48 goals, five assists, 10 ground balls, 23 draw controls 
After a freshman season in which she posted an Ivy League leading 56 scores and finished third in the nation with 3.73 goals per game, Jennifer VanderMeulen returned for more this past spring. While her sophomore numbers were down—she finished with eight fewer goals—VanderMeulen’s role as the Crimson’s offensive leader didn’t change. Once again, VanderMeulen led Harvard and the Ivy League in scoring and posted three game-winning goals.
VanderMeulen’s performance not only earned her a place on the All-Ivy First Team for the second time in as many years, it also helped the Crimson to a 5-2 Ivy League finish, the program’s best finish in conference play since 1994. While Harvard did not end up in the NCAA tournament, VanderMeulen helped the Crimson reach the championship of the Ivy League tournament.
 
 
Bonnie Hu — 75.55 scoring average, 41st overall at NCAA Regionals (2010-11 season)
Billed as a “Freshman to Watch” by Golfweek Magazine, Bonnie Hu didn’t disappoint in her rookie campaign, putting together the top statistical season in Harvard women’s golf history. Her scoring average of 75.55 was the lowest in program history, and she earned the first-ever bid to the NCAA Regionals, where she finished 41st overall.
Hu, a Crimson business editor, rattled off a number of impressive outings at the beginning of the season, including a one-under 71 against Cal to tie for the best score of the day. The freshman fell into a slump near the end of the season, though, finishing out of the top 11 in the Ivy League Championships and failing to qualify for any league accolades. Opening the tournament with an 80 and a 79, well over her season average, Hu found her form on the final day, shooting a 73 to help propel the Crimson to a second-place finish in the league.
In the young 2011-12 season, Hu has played a critical role in two Crimson tournament victories. In the year’s first competition, the Yale Invitational, Hu shot a seven-over 223, good for fifth place out of the 78 competitors. At the following week’s Princeton Invitational, the sophomore turned in another sterling performance, shooting an eight-over 224 to finish eighth in a field of 62. Through four tournaments this year, Hu has averaged a 75.6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many students realize their time in their own beds and with golden-nugget-free meals will soon come to an end, athletes from Harvard’s more aquatic teams have been enjoying training in different places all over the world.
Travelling for winter training is nothing new for Harvard Athletics. While both men’s and women’s basketball and hockey must return to Cambridge shortly after Christmas, other teams with winter seasons use their extended breaks as an opportunity to train and improve outside the confines of the College.
With Sunday’s high in Cambridge forecasted to be 21 degrees, the men’s and women’s swimming teams will be trying to soak up the sun as much as possible as they end their time in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The men’s team arrived in the Puerto Rican capital last Saturday and will train for 10 days before returning for its home meet against Brown on Jan. 19. Co-captain Matthew McLean has been blogging his time in the Caribbean, documenting his team’s rigorous training, poolside relaxation, and general shenanigans.  
But the Crimson has been able to find some collegiate competition during its trip. Harvard took on Notre Dame in a four-event exhibition on Thursday. The Crimson and Fighting Irish split the four relays, with Harvard narrowly edging the Big East team in the 200-meter freestyle and backstroke relays, while dropping the 200-meter breaststroke and butterfly relays.
The women’s team arrived in the unincorporated American territory a few days before its male counterpart and will be back in Cambridge on Saturday to face off against Brown at Blodgett Pool.
What the women’s water polo team is losing in sunshine, it is gaining in Frequent Flyer Miles. The Crimson travelled to Eger, Hungary, where it has scrimmaged numerous local club teams and travelled throughout the city, learning about its political and historical significance. You can follow Harvard as the squad goes into Budapest for the remainder of its trip on its blog.
A little closer to home, all four Crimson crew teams have all gone to Florida for their annual J-Term training. And while a trip to the Sunshine State may normally inspire jealousy among most students, the adventures of the swimming and women’s water polo teams might just have them beat this year.

And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
This morning we featured the matchup between Jennifer VanderMeulen and Bonnie Hu. Now, in our final matchup on the women’s side, we have soccer’s Mel Baskind against field hockey’s Cynthia Tassopoulos.
Midfielder Melanie Baskind—28 goals, six assists, 33 groundballs (lacrosse) and eight goals, eight assists (soccer).
Being named to one All-Ivy First Team in a year is impressive. Being named to two is a whole other story. A captain of both the women’s lacrosse and soccer teams, Baskind had an unforgettable 2011. After joining the lacrosse team as a sophomore in 2010, Baskind returned to the lacrosse pitch for her second season with the Crimson this past spring. She finished fourth on the team in goals (28), second in assists (six), first in ground balls (33), and second in draw controls (24), helping the Crimson to a 5-2 Ivy record—its best conference finish since 1994.
Just four months later, Baskind turned in her lacrosse stick for a pair of soccer cleats. In her final season with the Harvard soccer team, Baskind led the Crimson to its third Ivy League title in four years, posting eight goals and eight assists and tying for tops in the conference with 24 points. After the season, the senior was unanimously selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year, making her the only Harvard athlete to be named to two All-Ivy First Teams in 2011.
Goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos – .806 save percentage, 154 saves, 1180 minutes in goal
The Harvard field hockey played 1203 minutes in 2011. For 1180 of those, junior Cynthia Tassopoulos stood between the pipes. In that time, the goalkeeper saved 80.6 percent of shots that came her way, the best mark in the Ivy League and the fourth best in the nation. Tassopoulos’ dominance in the goal helped the Crimson this year to its best record since 2007.
In just the 2011 season alone, Tassopoulos had 154 saves, which by itself would be enough to rank her ninth on Harvard’s all-time list of career saves. In her three-year career, Tassopoulos now has 420 saves, good for fourth all-time. With one year left to play, Tassopoulos is only 14 saves away from taking the number three spot.
Despite her strong 2011 performance, Tassopoulos only received an honorable mention in the 2011 All-Ivy honors, a year after earning a second-team All-Ivy nod in what was a statistically worse season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took almost 30 shots, but the Harvard women’s hockey team found a way to beat Union goalkeeper Kate Gallagher Friday night at the Bright Hockey  Center.
At the 16:54 mark in the second period, sophomore Elizabeth Parker redirected a high shot from rookie forward Hillary Crowe to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
Captain Alisa Baumgartner then put the game away in the third period when her shot from the right flank snuck past Gallagher with 7:07 left to play in the contest. The forward made her first appearance since last season when she sustained a shoulder injury that kept her off the ice for over 10 months.
“It’s good to get the legs going again,” said Baumgartner after the Crimson's 2-0 win. “It was definitely nice to be back out there. I made some good plays, [but] I [also] made a lot of mistakes, so from here on out, it’s about getting better on the little things.”
Defensively, Harvard put on a strong performance, limiting the visitors to 15 total shots. Junior goalkeeper Laura Bellamy captured her second clean sheet of the season, but it was her counterpart who stole the show.
Gallagher seemed impenetrable for almost two periods, showing good reflexes and alertness against an offense that ranks second in the league. The goalkeeper stopped 12 shots in the first period alone, a frame where the Crimson, led by sophomore Lyndsey Fry’s and sophomore Gina McDonald’s three shots apiece, came out of the gates firing.
“[Union’s] goaltender played out of her mind—I thought she was awesome,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She made it look easy tonight.”
Union could not keep up with Harvard, putting up six shots in the first period and five in the second. The Crimson did not relent in the second frame, testing Gallagher with 18 shots, one of which got past the junior goalie.
Parker finally gave the home team what it wanted when she stuck her stick out in the air to hit the puck, which was sailing wide left, into the back of the net.
“I was just trying to get a stick on it, hoping to get it towards the net. It was a great pass [from Crowe],” Parker said.
Fry once again led Harvard with five shots in the period, followed by sophomore Marissa Gedman’s three attempts.
It was Gedman who initiated the play that sealed the victory in the final minutes of the contest. The defender, racing down the middle of the ice, saw Baumgartner skating down the right side and passed her the puck. With freshman Samantha Reber standing near the goal, the senior realized that the rookie had drawn defenders away, giving her enough space for a shot. Baumgartner let one fly, and the puck slid right under Gallagher’s legs and into the net.
“I wasn’t expecting it—it was definitely a plus that it went in,” Baumgartner said. “I saw Reber going to the net hard, and honestly, I was just looking to put the puck on net for a rebound for her. But luckily, it went in.”
It was a dream return for Baumgartner, who made it through physical therapy in time for the rest of her senior campaign.
“We’re sort of getting our roster back full again,” Stone said. “We’re desperate to get everybody healthy and back in the lineup, and that’s when we are at our best, obviously.”
Harvard finished with 36 shots on the night, outskating its opponent almost the entire contest. The Crimson faces Rensselaer on Saturday for its second home game in as many days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—As it turns out, Fenway  Park in January can be pretty cold.
The century-old home of the Boston Red Sox hosted Friday night’s Harvard-Union matchup—Harvard, technically, was the home team—and conditions in the outdoor game were anything but standard for hockey.
In the shadow of the Green Monster, No. 14 Union (11-5-6, 5-2-3 ECAC) beat Harvard (4-5-6, 3-4-4), 2-0. But the story of the game was the venue of the ECAC matchup.
At the beginning of each period, the ice, maintained by Zambonis stored under the centerfield bleachers, appeared well-maintained and the puck moved well throughout the first several minutes. But towards the end of each frame, the ice looked to thin out, and players noted the erratic movement of the puck.
“It wasn’t too much of a factor in the game. It was kind of actually a cool thing,” senior defenseman Ryan Grimshaw said of the conditions. “[The puck] was a bit bouncy out there. … The one key was to keep it simple and get it up quick.
The rules were even adjusted to try to account for the wind. Midway through the third period, the Crimson and the Dutchmen switched sides to give each team an even 30 minutes on both ends of the makeshift rink.
“My toes were pretty numb,” Union coach Rick Bennett said when asked about the conditions of the game.
In one of the game’s pivotal moments, the Fenway rink cost Harvard a chance at taking the lead. All night, the nets were knocked loose several times on both sides of the ice.
About four minutes into the second period, senior forward Daniel Moriarty passed from behind the net to senior defenseman Peter Starrett, who appeared to knock in the game’s first goal. But replay showed that the net came loose just moments before the puck went in, and the goal was waved off.
“The swing where we had a goal called back, and they scored with three seconds proved to be too big a hurdle for us to overcome,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said, referring to Union’s first goal in the closing seconds of the second period.
Despite the tough conditions, players on both sides enjoyed the unique opportunity to play at the historic baseball stadium in front of 8,981 fans.
“It was definitely a rewarding experience, and something I will never forget,” Grimshaw said. “We got presented the opportunity to play at Fenway, [and] we jumped right on it. It’s obviously an opportunity you can’t pass.”
A MORE PERFECT UNION
When the Crimson played the Dutchmen one week ago in Schenectady, N.Y., the visitors went into the final period down two goals.
But Union surrendered two Harvard scores in the first seven minutes of the third, and the two teams tied, 3-3.
In the first period of Friday’s game, it looked like the Crimson had carried some of that momentum into Fenway Park, outshooting Union, 11-8, and missing narrowly on a few chances.
But after Harvard’s called-off goal in the second period, the Dutchmen took control. In the final two frames of the game, Union outshot the Crimson, 24-7, and finally got on the board with a goal in the last four seconds of the second period.
“Coach [Rick] Bennett actually mentioned between the first and second that it was going to be a greasy goal,” said Union’s Mat Bodie, who scored the game’s first goal. “He mentioned it was going to go off a guy’s butt, and I’m pretty sure it did. Bit of a lucky bounce, but we’ll take it.”
Union scored again early in the third period, and Harvard could muster little offense in the final 20 minutes of the game, taking just two shots and never seriously threatening the Union net.
I (HAVEN’T) GOT THE POWER
 
All season, the power play has been one of Harvard’s strengths. Until Friday night, the Crimson hadn’t failed to score at least one power play goal in over two months.
The Crimson went on the power play twice against the Dutchmen, both in the second period. The team had its chances—senior forward Alex Killorn and junior forward Marshall Everson each narrowly missed goals—but the team could not convert on its chances around the net.
Union scored its first goal on the power play after Harvard freshman defenseman Patrick McNally went to the box for tripping, and the Crimson never recovered from its one-goal deficit.
Even so, the Dutchmen could not capitalize on many of their own chances. The team was one for five with the one-man advantage, squandering two opportunities in the third period to pad its lead.
"I’m just glad we got the two points, and glad for Troy Grosenick," said Bodie of the Union goaltender, who finished with 18 saves. "I think he was great in net. He really deserved that shutout."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—After nearly two periods of back-and-forth, scoreless play on the ice at Fenway Park, it looked like the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-5-6, 3-4-4 ECAC) and No. 13/14 Union (11-5-6, 5-2-3) were headed toward the same result as when the squads met last Friday: a draw. But with just four seconds to play in the second frame of Friday night’s rematch, the Dutchmen’s Mat Bodie netted a momentum-changing goal on a brief power-play opportunity to help Union claim a 2-0 victory over the Crimson.
“[We’re] disappointed with the result,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought Union won most of the battles, beat us to pucks, [and] made the plays when they had to. … As the game wore on I thought they really beat us in pretty much most of the battle areas.”
At 17:33 in the second period, Harvard had earned its second man advantage of the game, as a slashing violation landed Union sophomore Daniel Carr in the penalty box. But the Crimson power play was short-lived. Just 44 seconds later, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally followed suit and was sent off the ice for tripping, leveling the playing field to four skaters apiece as the second frame neared its close.
With 27 seconds left in the period, Carr came back onto the ice and the Dutchmen were able to capitalize on the ensuing scramble. After nicking Harvard captain Ryan Grimshaw’s skate, the puck found its way to Bodie’s stick, and the sophomore converted the game-winner on a one-time shot. Kelly Zajac and Shayne Gostisbehere were credited with assists on the play.
“I’m not exactly sure what happened there,” Grimshaw said. “I went down to block [the shot] when I saw [Bodie] get loose in the slot there. I know it tipped off of my foot, and I think it may have even popped up. I didn’t get a look at the replay; I think it may have just dropped in.”
“It was a bit of a lucky bounce,” Bodie said. “But we’ll take it.”
Union stretched its lead to two in the opening minutes of the final frame, as Zajac earned a tally of his own from close range at 5:37 with help from teammates Wayne Simpson and Nolan Julseth-White.
“The best thing for us was to get out of [the first] period 0-0,” Union coach Rick Bennett said. “Once the second came, it was like a wave.”
Although the Dutchmen shut the Crimson down in the third period, limiting Harvard to just two shot attempts, the Crimson was not without its chances early on. At 3:34 in the second frame, assistant captain Daniel Moriarty worked the puck around the back of the Union goal and slotted it across to classmate and fellow forward Peter Starrett.
Starrett came across the net from the left side and placed the puck past Union goaltender Troy Grosenick. The tally registered on the Fenway scoreboard, but the go-ahead goal was called back after the referees determined the net had moved out of position before the score.
“When the goal got called back and then they got their goal … it was a bit of a momentum swing,” Donato said. “It knocked the wind out of our sails. Give them credit because they didn’t let us get back into the game in the third.”
“It was a discipline game for both teams,” Bennett said. “They have two power plays and you only give up two shots. We’ll take that.”
The Crimson started off the contest with momentum, outshooting Union, 8-1, in the first few minutes of play. But in the third period it was all Union. Harvard pulled freshman goaltender Steve Michalek in a last-ditch attempt to put points on the board, but it was to no avail, as the Dutchmen sealed the 2-0 shutout.
Despite the loss, which drops the Crimson below .500 in ECAC play, Grimshaw remained positive about Harvard’s overall experience in the team’s first ever hockey game at historic Fenway Park.
“Obviously it would have been better to get the win, but … we’ll definitely remember it,” Grimshaw said.
