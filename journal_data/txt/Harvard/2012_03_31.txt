After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2012, 4:29 a.m.
Harvard University President Drew G. Faust announced Friday that David N. Hempton, the Alonzo L. McDonald Family Professor of Evangelical Theological Studies, will be the Divinity School’s next dean.
“David Hempton is an internationally recognized historian of Christianity with an exceptionally distinguished scholarly record,” Faust said in a press release. “His broad-ranging interests in religion, political culture, identity, and ethnic conflict, and the history and theology of Evangelical Protestantism make him particularly well-suited to advance the understanding of religion at Harvard and in this religiously pluralistic world.”
On July 1, Hempton will assume the post that has been held for the past ten years by William A. Graham, a professor of Middle Eastern studies and former Currier House Master.
“I am grateful to President Faust for this opportunity, and I am honored and humbled to be asked to serve as the next dean of the Harvard Divinity School,” Hempton said in a press release. “I look forward to working with colleagues at the Divinity School to build on the progress made over the last decade in expanding and strengthening the faculty across a range of fields and broadening the scope of the education offered.”
Since joining the Divinity School’s faculty in 2007, Hempton has taught courses at both the Divinity School and the College. His past classes include “Secularization in Europe and the United States, c. 1780-2000,” which received a 5.0 on the undergraduate Q guide evaluation—the highest mark a course can earn.
“The contribution that our faculty makes toward the study of religion at the College is something we need to strengthen and build on,” Hempton said. “Increasing religious literacy at Harvard and in the United States is a top priority of mine.”
Prior to arriving at Harvard, Hempton, who is originally from Northern Ireland, served as the director of the School of History at the Queen’s University Belfast. Hempton was also a University Professor at Boston University, where he taught courses on the history of Christianity.
Upon coming to Harvard, Hempton said that he wanted to increase interest in the area of Evangelical theology.
“I never thought at any point during my professorship that I would one day be dean,” he said, calling to the appointment process as a “whirlwind.”
While the position will provide new challenges for Hempton, he said that he has prepared a three-part plan for effecting change under his deanship at the Divinity School.
“I have a bit of a learning curve, and even though I know the place quite well, I have created an outline of three concentric circles that I think the Divinity School should be thinking about,” he said. “My goals are to strengthen the school’s historic roots in religious study, to prepare our students for national and international leadership, and build bridges across religious and cultural divides.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team had some early hiccups, but recovered to take control of the match, as it downed conference foe Rutgers-Newark, 3-1, at the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday night.
The Crimson (15-3, 7-2 EIVA) started out strong, taking a comfortable 25-20 victory in the first set. Co-captain Matt Jones doled out five of 15 kills in the opening frame, and Harvard appeared in control.
But the second set saw the momentum turn. The Scarlet Raiders (8-11, 1-8 EIVA) jumped out to a quick 8-2 lead through several Crimson attack errors and three service aces from Rutgers-Newark. Harvard began a 3-0 run as it searched for a foothold in the game, but the Scarlet Raiders responded with a run of their own. And despite two timeouts from Crimson coach Brian Baise, Rutgers-Newark appeared set to take the game with ease. But with the score at 20-9, Harvard ended the game on a 9-5 run, and appeared to regain energy despite dropping the set, 25-18.
After an extended meeting in the locker room with Baise, the Crimson came out firing in the third, and though the Scarlet Raiders kept in close in the opening exchanges, Harvard’s improved passing was evident as it charged to a 25-15 victory.
With an energetic crowd behind it, the Crimson continued the strong offensive play, as Rutgers-Newark fell to mental errors of its own, with Harvard taking the game and the match, 25-20.
The Crimson returns to the Malkin Athletic Center Saturday afternoon for its final home game and Senior Night against NJIT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior forward Alex Killorn isn’t the men’s hockey team’s only senior skater already making moves from the confines of Cambridge to the professional circuit.
Nine days after Killorn signed a two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning, captain defenseman Ryan Grimshaw made his pro debut for the Trenton Titans, a minor league hockey team in the ECHL, on Mar. 28. Grimshaw tallied four of the Titan’s 31 shots in a 2-1 overtime loss to the Elmira Jackals.
“I was pleased with how Grimshaw played,” Titans coach Vance Williams told The Trentonian after the contest. “He does things hard, he’s got urgency in his game, he’s got readiness. He’s engaging, which I like as a defenseman.”
Grimshaw suited up again for the last-place Titans on Friday night. The former Harvard captain couldn’t prevent another loss. This time, Trenton fell to the Wheeling Nailers, 4-1.
The Titans, affiliated with the NHL’s Philadelphia Flyers, play in the ECHL, a league considered to be one tier below the American Hockey League in prestige and two below the NHL.
Unlike Grimshaw, Killorn kicked off his professional career in the AHL with the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning’s minor league affiliate. The former Crimson standout has scored a goal and notched an assist in his first four games.

Paul D. Ceglia, an entrepreneur who claims that he invested $1,000 to help get Facebook off the ground and was offered half of the website's future shares in return, filed a lawsuit in 2010 against Mark E. Zuckerberg with alleged email exchanges as proof. Zuckerberg's lawyers, in return, recently released emails that the famous Harvard-dropout wrote during his time in Cambridge in an attempt to disprove these claims.
According to Ceglia, Zuckerberg guaranteed him ownership of fifty percent of what would become Facebook, but Ceglia cannot find the original emails in which Zuckerberg supposedly made such a generous guarantee. Instead, Ceglia has brought forward Microsoft Word documents containing the emails supporting his claims. Seem fishy? We think so too. (And here's some proof from 2011 to attest to it.)
Facebook maintains that Ceglia most likely wrote the documents on his computer quite recently, and by altering his internal computer clock, can fraudulently claim that the Word documents are from 2004, the year Zuckerberg created Facebook at Harvard. Facebook in turn released Zuckerberg's emails from the Harvard server at the time of his communications with Ceglia, and none of the emails found in Ceglia's Word documents have shown up on the server.
Of these emails released by Facebook, most relate to business between Ceglia and Zuckerberg, and not to the Winklevoss twins or Kirkland House. One email, however, from Jan. 25, 2004, reveals that the Harvard dropout had some feelings of fondness towards the school after all.
Zuckerberg wrote, "I am at a school surrounded by some of the smartest people in the world cultivating ideas and constantly coming up with great projects to work on...My time is valuable, and seems better spent on other things that I know, or at least can reasonably expect, will produce some sort of gratification in the near future."
Flyby is pretty confident that in creating Facebook, Zuckerberg found the gratification he was looking for.

For those Flyby readers interested in English lawn games, prepare to be disappointed: Pfoho Croquet will not involve any actual mallets or wickets.
Instead, on April 13 at 9 p.m., Pforzheimer residents will be traveling to different, metaphorical "wickets"—themed rooms around the House—for food and drink. After the controversy surrounding last year's Pfoho Golf, which was cancelled due to concerns about the event's compliance with the College's revised alcohol policy, the newly-named Croquet will allow Pfohosers to eat, drink, and socialize together once again.
This time, "The game will begin in our dhall where an SES member will check IDs," wrote Emma M. Templeton '13, Pfoho House Council social co-chair, in an email. "Residents who are 21+ will be given wristbands." Non-alcoholic drinks will be available wherever alcoholic ones are being served, though there won't be alcohol in all "wickets."
Why croquet? "I really like the word 'wicket,'" Templeton wrote, though "it is by no means required that residents play croquet during Croquet."
Not required, perhaps, but Flyby definitely encourages Pfoho residents to take advantage of the fesitivities and perhaps get in a game or two of the classy British sport while they're at it.
