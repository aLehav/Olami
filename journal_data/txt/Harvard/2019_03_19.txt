After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow remained firm in his stance against divestment in an interview Friday, just as student activists demand he take part in a public forum on fossil fuel divestment.
Bacow reiterated Harvard presidents’ long standing policy against divestment, originally put forth by former University President Derek C. Bok: Harvard’s nearly $40 billion endowment is not — and has never been — a mechanism for social change.
“The endowment exists to support the institution, to support our students, and to support our faculty,” Bacow said. “And it was on those terms that our donors have entrusted the resources to us. They've said here, here are these resources which we want you to invest to support these activities — not to accomplish some other ends.”
Divestment is not unheard of — Harvard most recently withdrew investments from the tobacco industry in 1990 — but it is rare.
Bacow also said that in order to decrease fossil fuel use in the long run, the University must “engage with the fossil fuel industry” as “shareholders,” as well as through research.
“I don't understand how we on the one hand say we think it's immoral to own your stock, but, by the way, we would like to work closely with you as you develop clean technology, as you develop cap and trade systems, as we seek to create a carbon tax, for example,” Bacow said.
“The information that allows us to do those things lie within industry. We can't do that on our own. So if we're going to affect the world through our scholarship we need to engage, not isolate ourselves,” he added.
Bacow’s position comes at a time when student activists from across the University are reinvigorating their calls for Bacow and the Harvard Management Company — the University’s investment arm — to withdraw its controversial investments, including those from companies within the fossil fuel industry or with connections to prisons.
Students seeking divestment from these industries have delivered petitions to Massachusetts Hall, met personally with Bacow to present their concerns, and most recently, demanded Bacow participate in a public forum with students regarding divestment.
Divest Harvard — a student group committed to divesting Harvard from fossil fuels — sent a statement to Bacow Friday asking him to partake in a public forum about divestment from the fossil fuel industry at “any time and in any place.”
Ilana A. Cohen ’22, an organizer with Divest Harvard, said the group is hoping that administrators “value” this engagement with “challenging issues.”
"Harvard is a place founded upon the very idea of civil discourse,” Cohen said. “So, we think it's incumbent upon the administration to be willing to talk with us and to be willing to have their stance challenged because those are the kinds of ideals that they expect us to carry as students every day."
The statement notes that more than 70 percent of College students who voted in the last Undergraduate Council election voted to divest from fossil fuels.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the letter and pointed to Bacow’s previous statements on divestment.
Divest Harvard’s demand comes as part of their revitalized “Heat Week” campaign set to take place in April 2019, Cohen said. Cohen added the group is planning on restaging the campaign to be “louder” and “larger” than when it was first launched in 2015.
“Heat Week” originally began as week-long protest organized by Divest Harvard in April 2015. Hundreds of students and several faculty members blockaded Mass. Hall for a week, occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters for two days, and blockaded University Hall multiple times.
When asked about the sustained activism on divestment, Bacow said he commends the activists’ passion but disagrees with their strategy.
“I applaud their passion and their interest and their desire to make a difference in the world,” Bacow said. “I took this job because I want to make a difference in the world.”
“I just think we differ on tactics in certain cases,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard currently faces a complaint filed with the United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights alleging the College’s 2018 decision to place former student Ty Pelton-Byce ’20 on a mandatory leave of absence constituted disability-based discrimination.
The complaint — filed March 14 by Pelton-Byce’s mother, Alicia Pelton — alleges that College officials had violated section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating against people with mental or physical disabilities.
The complaint states that Pelton-Byce — who played for the men's varsity hockey team — was diagnosed with depression by two mental health professionals and argues the College failed to provide appropriate accommodations for his diagnosis when administrators put him on a mandatory leave of absence after he received a failing grade and an unsatisfactory grade in two classes during spring 2018.
Pelton-Byce’s case first came before the Administrative Board in spring 2018, according to the complaint. On May 14, 2018, after he finished his exams and returned home, Mather House Resident Dean Luke Leafgren emailed him to inform him he had failed a class and would almost certainly be required by the Ad Board to take a year-long leave of absence.
At the time, Leafgren cited College policies that allow students to request exceptions to the usual two semesters of leave. In an email attached as evidence in the complaint, Leafgren wrote that “exceptions are rare and are only granted when extenuating circumstances have impacted a student’s ability to meet their academic requirements.”
The Ad Board’s policy states that a requirement to withdraw from the College is the standard response for a student who has received two consecutive unsatisfactory grades. Student may request the Ad Board to reconsider any of its decisions if new, relevant information becomes available.
Days after Leafgren emailed Pelton-Byce, he received a diagnosis of clinical depression from a psychologist, according to the complaint. Pelton claims that Leafgren knew about Pelton-Byce’s depression as early as May 16, 2018.
Pelton argues that, even before the Ad Board heard her son’s case, Leafgren’s behavior communicated that his mental health would be seen as a reason not to grant him an exception to the two-semester absence policy. Leafgren also allegedly told Pelton in a May 22, 2018 phone call that “Harvard is not a place for getting healthy, it is a place for the healthy because it is so intense.”
Leafgren declined to comment on the allegations or on Pelton-Byce’s case, citing Ad Board confidentiality policies.
Pelton alleges that emails and phone calls from College officials revealed a “mental health discriminatory culture” in the weeks leading up to the decision to place Pelton-Byce on leave.
In addition to a personal statement, Pelton-Byce submitted letters from two mental health professionals to the Ad Board. In the statements attached to the OCR complaint, both wrote that they believed he was capable of returning to the College in fall 2018 and adequately completing his academic work.
Pelton wrote in the complaint that the Ad Board forwarded the statements to Counseling and Mental Health Services social worker Melanie G. Northrop. A 2018 Harvard Disability Services report — which concluded the University had not discriminated against Pelton-Byce — cited Northrop’s conclusion that one letter “did little to connect [Pelton-Byce’s] diagnosis to his poor academic performance.” Northrop also allegedly questioned the number of times the clinicians had treated Pelton-Byce before writing their letters.
In the OCR complaint, Pelton alleges that Northrop’s handling of her son’s case “illuminate[s] the mental health discriminatory culture at Harvard, within the Harvard Administrative Board and their procedures.”
Northrop did not respond to a request for comment on the complaint.
On May 30, 2018, Leafgren informed Pelton-Byce that the Ad Board had decided to place him on the year-long leave.
“The Board took this decision believing that a year away from Harvard will ensure that you will have the time to develop the insights and skills necessary to succeed when you return, including if your depressive episode returned,” he wrote.
At the time, Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Brett Flehinger’s “primary concern” was whether Pelton-Byce had been in treatment for long enough to ensure he would be able to succeed academically, according to the Disability Services report. Pelton alleges that Pelton-Byce’s depressive episode was the sole reason Flehinger was concerned about his ability to complete his work.
Flehinger, who serves on the Ad Board, did not comment on the allegations in Pelton’s complaint.
Pelton alleges the Ad Board’s decision reflects its consideration of Pelton-Byce’s depression as a “negative factor” and its failure to recognize it as an “extenuating circumstance.”
In June 2018, Pelton-Byce requested that the Ad Board reconsider his case in their August meeting. College policies allow for a second review if the applicant presents either “new materially relevant information” or “reasonable evidence of a procedural error.”
Pelton-Byce submitted additional documents to the Ad Board including letters from his doctors and Harvard Law School Professor William P. Alford. The letters cited his progress over the summer as new information for the Ad Board to consider.
Pelton wrote in the complaint that on Aug. 14, 2018, Flehinger called Pelton-Byce to tell him the Ad Board did not reconsider his case. He allegedly said that the Ad Board “cannot make reconsiderations just because students work on themselves over the summer.”
Following his failed reconsideration request, Pelton-Byce requested on Sept. 6, 2018 that Disability Services investigate whether the College discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his depression. The Disability Services report found the Ad Board followed internal procedures and did not discriminate against Pelton-Byce.
In January 2019, Pelton-Byce transferred to the University of Wisconsin.
In an email to The Crimson, Pelton wrote that she filed the complaint because she believes the College’s mental health accommodations are insufficient.
“Harvard has a reputation of being the leader, being the best, but clearly is not when it comes to mental health,” she wrote. “The more research I was doing the more I realized they are behind in the undergraduate school when it comes to mental health issues, services, awareness and programs.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the complaint.
The Department of Education currently has six open investigations into alleged disability discrimination at Harvard — one 2013 case into the University, two 2017 cases into the Extension School, and three 2017 cases into the Kennedy School.
Per Department of Education policy, the Office for Civil Rights reviews all complaints but does not publicly acknowledge a complaint unless the Office decides to open an investigation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball cannot dwell on the disappointment of Sunday’s loss to Yale in the Ivy finals, as there is still meaningful basketball left to be played.
The Crimson will travel back to Washington D.C. — where it defeated Howard on Martin Luther King Day — to face perennial Big East foe Georgetown in the first round of the National Invitational Tournament(NIT).
This game will not be held in Capital One Arena (the NHL’s Washington Capitals also have a home game there on Wednesday night). Instead, the 7 PM contest will be played on-campus at the 2,500-seat McDonough Arena and is scheduled to be broadcast nationally on ESPN2. Tickets will not be distributed publicly, although there will be a small allotment to Harvard supporters according to an email by the Harvard Ticket Office.
“We are going to look at it from a total picture of winning a regular season again, back-to-back Ivy champions and playing in [the] postseason,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s a tremendous honor for our program at this point and so that’s how we see it and how we’re going to approach it. We’re disappointed, but not down. There’s a big difference in those two words.”
The No. 6-seeded Crimson booked its spot in the tournament through winning a share of the Ivy regular-season title, while No. 3 Georgetown earned an at-large bid after finishing in a tie for third in the Big East Conference. Considered a bubble team, the Hoyas saw their March Madness chances eviscerate after falling to Seton Hall in the tournament quarterfinals.
Nevertheless, this is a Georgetown team on the rise in Year Two of the Patrick Ewing era. The Hoyas have not played in a postseason tournament since its loss to Utah in the 2015 NCAA Tournament, and their 9-9 final conference mark is the best since that season. Ewing’s return to his alma mater has injected new talent and appeal to the program, exemplified by his trio of first-years: Big East all-freshmen Mac McClung, James Akinjo, and Josh LeBlanc.
Akinjo, a 6-foot-even guard who was named Big East Freshman of the Year with his 13.3 points and 5.3 assists per game, is connected to Crimson first-year Mason Forbes. The two were AAU teammates in the Bay Area and competed against each other in their senior-year high school playoffs. Forbes hails from Folsom High School, while Akinjo graduated from Salesian College Prep.
“His very last game in high school, we actually beat them,” Forbes said. “So it will be a little bit of a rivalry there. But at the same time, since playing with him it will be fun to play against him. He goes hard and he’s a dog, but we have dogs on our team too. So I’m not worried that our guys will take care of business.”
Harvard’s own Tommy Amaker will also have the opportunity to briefly return back to the “DMV”, although he acknowledged his team will be unable to participate in extensive off-court activities due to the tight turnaround. When playing Howard, the team stopped by the Martin Luther King Jr., memorial and planned on visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture if not for the government shutdown. Still, Amaker said that he fielded multiple offers from alums and friends to host the program outside of the game.
The Harvard coach is a graduate of nearby W.T. Woodson High School and remarked on his connections with the Georgetown program through former teammates.
“I’ve been able to watch their program and their teams through the years and have had friends during my yesteryear,” Amaker said. “At times I have played with various players who have played at Georgetown, so I have some history there and just in terms of being from that area.”
Outside of the aforementioned Akinjo, the Hoyas are led by towering senior Jessie Govan who leads the team with 17.3 PPG. The 6’10” all-Big East first teamer returned his final season despite fielding NBA interest and threatens from both the interior and beyond the arc, with a 40.7 percent mark from deep. Georgetown has been carried offensively by their three freshmen and Govan, with wins over Marquette and Villanova in a competitive conference slate.
“The difference is the freshmen,” said Ewing following the team’s exit from the Big East Tournament. “The freshmen, they played great. They played extremely well, and they have their highs and their lows. But for the most part I thought they had a great season.”
One such freshman, McClung, received notoriety on social media before even stepping foot on campus due to his dunking mixtape. But the Virginia native has also impressed with his perimeter shooting and propensity to hit big shots late in contests, much like the Crimson’s Bryce Aiken.
Speaking of Aiken, the duel between he and the Georgetown guards should be an exciting one. Coming off a 38-point performance against Yale, the Crimson guard will need another resounding individual effort to get past this Hoya side and prolong its season. This will be the Harvard point guard’s first time playing in a postseason tournament, as he was injured in last season’s trip to Milwaukee. Harvard lost to Marquette, another Big East side, in the first round of the NIT 67-60 to conclude their campaign.
For now, Harvard is gearing back up for two more practices and recalibrating for a compelling matchup of two renowned institutions.
“Just focusing on staying together, and you still got more games to play,” sophomore Rio Haskett said. “So we can’t really dwell on the past. It’s just moving on.”
A meeting at the Hilltop, to decide if Harvard can move on. Time for postseason basketball.

When the tourists go away, what’s here to stay? After the sun sets in Harvard Square, students and locals alike partake in a colorful culture of nightlife, ranging from playing games to partying to studying. Until two or three in the morning, the Square is bustling with people, all with different intentions, whether it be a bowl of nachos at Jefes, a late night problem set in Lamont, or a night out at a Harvard final club.
On a Friday night, Erica M. Jarrell ‘21 bartends at the Cambridge Queenshead Pub. Located under Harvard’s Memorial Hall, the Queenshead Pub hosts different events ranging from Karaoke to Trivia.
Julio F. Torres Santana, a Masters of Architecture student at the Graduate School of Design, plays pool at the Queenshead Pub on many Friday nights.
A party-goer makes a phone call as she attempts to enter a traditionally exclusive final club at Harvard University, the Phoenix S.K. Club. Parties hosted by Harvard’s final clubs are a prominent part of campus nightlife.
Hong Kong’s bright neon red sign is an iconic symbol of Harvard Square’s nightlife. Colloquially known as “Kong” among Harvard students, the Chinese restaurant is a popular destination for late-night meals.
Tanisha M. Mugwimi ‘21 and Jess J. Shodipo ‘20 enjoy the cheesy texture of mozzarella sticks at 2 a.m. in Winthrop House’s Grille and Cafe.
A Harvard night out would not be complete without a line out the door of El Jefe’s Taqueria, a popular Mexican fast food restaurant in the Square. On weekends, students and locals alike can take advantage of the taqueria’s operating hours until 4 a.m. to recover from a long night out.
While partying occurs on Harvard’s campus, many students often retreat to the libraries to study. Students Jonathan M. Ragheb ‘22 and Michael O. Raji ‘22 are working in the Smith Center’s Collaborative Commons on a problem set for their introductory biology course. Although busy with work, both students appear to be enjoying themselves.
Looking through a gate of Harvard Yard, the Harvard shuttle zooms down Massachusetts Avenue as it begins the trek to the Radcliffe Quad. Many weekends, the shuttle is bustling with Harvard undergraduates heading to the Radcliffe Quad in search of a party.
Harvard’s night culture is as fast-paced and busy as the day is for most students. Whether it be going out, studying, watching a movie, playing games, or even sleeping early, nightlife in Harvard Square is varied but plentiful.
