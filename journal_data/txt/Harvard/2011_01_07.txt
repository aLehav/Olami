After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—Make that three in a row.
For the third straight season, the Harvard men’s basketball team bested Boston College on the road, grabbing the 78-69 victory last night at Conte Forum.
“It feels great,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “It’s always a big game for us—they’re in Boston, and they’re in the ACC, so it feels great to come in here [and win].”
Along with classmate Keith Wright, McNally is one of only two Harvard players to have seen the floor in each of the three victories.
As a freshman during the 2008-09 season, McNally posted 17 points—then a career high—off the bench in the Crimson’s 82-70 win against the then-No. 17 Eagles. The 12-point win—Harvard’s first against a ranked opponent—came just days after BC had upset No. 1 North Carolina.
As a sophomore last season, McNally handed out four assists and pulled down three rebounds to help Harvard claim the 74-67 victory.
And last night, McNally chipped in 12 points and three rebounds.
“It’s special because I am going to look back on these games and think of [different things],” McNally said. “This year, new guys stepped up, and I’m going to think about Laurent [Rivard] stepping up as a freshman and having a great game.”
Harvard, which had trailed Boston College 9-31 in the all-time series before Crimson coach Tommy Amaker took over the program in 2007, has managed to make a small dent in the Eagles’ advantage since, now improving to 12-31.
“I think we’ve been a little lucky, which you need to be,” Amaker said. “We’ve played well, which we have to do, and sometimes we’ve been able to catch them on an off night. Those things can make for a perfect storm, and we’ve been able to take advantage of those situations.”
Under Amaker, Harvard has had success against BCS conference opponents, going 5-6 with wins against Michigan (Big Ten) and Colorado (Big 12) in addition to Boston College (ACC).
“I think our kids have believed that any time we suit up and play against anyone that we should be able to compete,” Amaker said.
A CHARITABLE STRIPE
While it may not be sexy, Harvard has found an effective offensive weapon—the free throw line.
The Crimson—which currently boasts the nation's best free-throw shooting percentage at 81.5 percent—used the charity stripe to its advantage again last night, sinking 23-of-24 attempts.
“We know it’s a weapon of ours,” said McNally, who is currently third in the nation from the line, shooting 95.2 percent.
But despite having the third best percentage in the nation, McNally is not even the Crimson’s top free throw shooter.
That title goes to freshman Laurent Rivard, who has missed just one attempt all season and is shooting 97.2 percent from the line.
Last night, Rivard went a perfect six-for-six, sinking all of his attempts in the first half to keep Harvard in the game after the Eagles established an early lead.
“We’ve been an outstanding foul shooting team,” Amaker said. “I thought that kept us in it in the first half and then certainly allowed us to keep them at bay in the late game situation.”
SHORT BENCH
Entering last season, depth was supposed to be one of the Crimson’s strengths. But Harvard certainly didn’t rely on its depth to get the win last night, as only six players—McNally, Rivard, Wright, and sophomores Kyle Casey, Christian Webster, and Brandyn Curry—saw the court during the second half.
“We wanted to stick with the lineups and the guys that were able to help us tonight, because [BC] plays very small and they stretch you defensively,” Amaker said. “It wasn’t a night that we could go deep in the frontcourt. We just couldn’t afford that with the way that they spread it and shoot it and the fact that they go small.”
Amaker went to a four-guard lineup throughout the contest, playing Webster, McNally, Rivard, and Curry along with Wright or Casey.
Webster and Curry played 38 minutes apiece, with the latter going the entire second half without a breather.
“I think we’re in good shape,” McNally said. “I think we rely on each other to pick each other up and we work hard in practice, so in these types of games where coach does shorten the bench, it sort of pays off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once is a mistake. Twice is a coincidence. But three times is a pattern.
For the third straight season, the Harvard men’s basketball team went into Conte Forum and defeated cross-town rival Boston College (11-4). Overcoming an early deficit, the Crimson (10-3) rallied and never trailed in the second half, eventually winning, 78-69, last night.
“[The Eagles] have been as good as anybody this early in the season,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.  “To beat a team playing that well right now on their home floor is pretty special for us.”
Boston College fans thought that the Crimson’s recent success against the Eagles might come to an end with the graduation of Jeremy Lin ’10, but freshman forward Laurent Rivard picked up right where Lin left off.
“He’s a confident player. He’s fearless,” Amaker said. “You see that side to this kid. At the freshman level, it’s unusual—strength, confidence, but then that fearless part of him. He’s not afraid to take a big shot.”
Though he shot just two-for-seven from the field in the first half, Rivard scored 11 of his career-high 23 points in the opening frame by getting to the free throw line. The freshman, whose 97.2 free throw percentage is second-best in the nation, went six-for-six from the line over a nine-minute stretch in which he scored 11 of Harvard’s 16 points.
This scoring outburst coupled with tighter defense, and the Eagles saw a nine-point lead with 10:01 remaining in the opening half turn into a four-point deficit by halftime.
“We stayed with our game plan. We were confident in what we needed to do,” Amaker said. “I thought we got tougher defensively.”
Coming out of the break with a 33-29 lead, the Crimson did not miss a beat.
Again Rivard made plays in critical situations. Protecting a three-point lead with the shot clock winding down roughly six minutes into the half, Rivard hit a turn-around jump shot from the free throw line. Midway through the frame, the freshman hit a pair of threes in the span of 1:27 to keep Harvard’s lead above nine points.
The closest Boston College came to taking the lead came with 12:26 left in the game after forward Joe Trapani scored on a cut to the hoop to narrow the margin to 45-44.
But junior co-captain Keith Wright responded on the other end with an identical move. The Crimson’s big man, however, finished with a two-handed jam and drew a foul, silencing the crowd. He hit the ensuing free throw.
Wright was Harvard’s second-leading scorer on the night with 15 points. Junior co-captain Oliver McNally, and sophomore guards Christian Webster and Brandyn Curry also reached double figures with 12, 13, and 10 points, respectively.
But the night belonged to Rivard, and it was the freshman who put the nail in the coffin. After a pair of turnovers in the backcourt shrunk the lead from 70-59 to 70-65 with under two minutes remaining, the Crimson needed a bucket to stop the run.
With the shot clock ticking down, Wright received the ball in the high post and found Rivard on a weak-side cut for an easy layup. With 23 points, the forward led Harvard in scoring for the third consecutive game.
“My teammates trust me,” Rivard said. “My teammates—especially Brandyn and Oliver—are really doing a good job penetrating and kicking out, and they’ve made it pretty easy for me.”
Free throws iced the game for the Crimson—it hit 23 of 24 from the stripe overall—and Harvard closed out a convincing 78-69 victory.
Although the Eagles shot 50.9 percent from the field and 38.9 percent from three, the Crimson managed to limit the Eagles’ high-powered offense by forcing turnovers (14), limiting second-chance points (six), and keeping the home team off the free throw line (four makes on eight attempts).
Trapani led Boston College with 21 points, and guard Reggie Jackson and forward Corey Raji chipped in 18 and 12 points apiece.
“I was really pleased with our defensive effort,” Amaker said. “We had to defend outside the three point line. They’re so dangerous out there. I thought we did a tremendous job of finding the shooters and contesting shots.”
The Eagles were Harvard’s penultimate non-conference opponent. The Crimson opens its conference schedule at Dartmouth on Saturday before traveling to George Washington the following weekend for the final of non-conference matchup.
“We’ve beaten some good teams…the first couple years [I’ve been here], but I think we’ve been complacent after that, especially going into Ivy League play,” McNally said. “We don’t have the non-conference wins to get into the Tournament. We know that we’ve got to win the Ivy League…[This win] makes us feel good about ourselves: we’ve got to internalize that. But then tomorrow, we’re right back to work because we’ve got [Dartmouth] this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
St. John's Prep has become a recruiting hotbed for Harvard lately.
A state champion in football and lacrosse, Ryan Delisle has decided to bring his winning habits to Soldiers Field next fall. On Tuesday, the senior tight end and defensive end publicly confirmed a verbal commitment to play football for the Crimson next fall.
"Ryan was recruited by Boston College, Harvard, Brown, Georgetown, Virginia, [and others]," said Jim O'Leary, athletic director and head football coach. "He's one of our captains. He's well liked by everyone. He was in student government, [involved in] the whole school: he's one of those kinds of leaders...he's a very very good student and comes from a strong academic background."
In committing to the Crimson, Delisle joins three of his classmates who have already made plans to compete for Harvard: sailor John "Gram" Slattery, hockey player Colin Blackwell, and lacrosse player Matthew Scalise.
Slattery took 10th at the 2010 U.S. Sailing’s Chubb Junior Championships while racing with Brian Drumm for Eastern Yacht Club.
Scalise, meanwhile, while join older brother Mark on the Crimson lacrosse team. The brothers' father is Director of Athletics Bob Scalise. Last spring, the younger Scalise and Delisle helped St. John's Prep end Duxbury's run of six consecutive state championships in lacrosse.
While Blackwell will graduate with his classmates, he won't arrive in Cambridge until a year later.
"He'll go play juniors for a year," O'Leary said.
Back in October Blackwell chose Harvard over several top programs, including defending national champion Boston College.
"Calling [Eagles] Coach [Jerry] York was one of the toughest phone calls I've ever had to make," he told Phil Stacey of the Salem News. "It would have been unbelievable to play for him and for a school that's won two of the last three (NCAA) titles and also plays in the Beanpot. But any time I've ever been at Harvard, I've felt most comfortable there. It's the best fit for me."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston College took Harvard women’s basketball back to the basics last night at Conte Forum and taught the Crimson a tough lesson about the importance of rebounding.
Eagles’ center Carolyn Swords drove the message home when she scored in the final seconds off of a rebound and claimed an 80-78 victory for Boston College (13-2), who out-rebounded Harvard (6-6) throughout the contest.
“Unfortunately, [Swords] got the rebound and put it in,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said. “It’s pretty much what we expected—it was kind of the theme of the [game].”
Compared to the Eagles’ 42 rebounds, Harvard struggled to grab the ball off the boards, earning 29 rebounds—only nine of which were on offense.
“We had minimal turnovers and were very cohesive throughout the game…it’s our rebounding that got us in the end,” junior co-captain Jackie Alemany said.
Boston College scored 17 points off rebounds in the first half alone with much help from the statures of Swords and senior forward Stephanie Murphy, who together have an average height of 6’5”.
“Once we did start rebounding, Swords and Murphy are two very tall girls and they just reached over us,” Alemany said. “And, because we were so busy boxing out the forwards, [freshman guard Kristen Doherty] got to us, too.”
Aside from the stark difference in rebounds, both teams had fairly similar numbers across the board by the end of the night, proving to be an even match-up.
The cross-town rivalry seemed like it was played in quarters: the Crimson commanded the court in the first and final minutes of the game, and it was unable to overcome the 31-9 effort put up by the Eagles immediately before and after halftime.
“It’s definitely a disappointing loss, but I’m really proud of the way our team fought and battled for the full 40 minutes,” junior co-captain Jackie Alemany said. “Last night was the best game we’ve played yet as a team.”
Harvard pushed to a 33-26 lead with 3:35 left in the first half by sticking to the fundamentals of the well-balanced offense that has come to characterize the Crimson’s playing style.
Especially at the start of the game, Harvard—led by junior Brogan Berry’s 17 points and six assists—did an excellent job of sharing the ball, as shown by the double-digit scoring efforts of five players.
The Crimson maintained its effective offensive scheme, but in the closing minutes before halftime, the team’s diamond-and-one—following Swords—and two-three defensive formations began to break down as the team’s energy faltered.
This allowed Boston College to rally back from a seven-point deficit and eventually knot up the score at 38 in the final minutes of the opening stanza.
“We had a few transition issues when they went on that run,” Alemany said. “We didn’t match up well or run back quickly enough. Swords got too many transition shots where she just ran across the lanes and made her favorite lucky hook-shot layup.”
Despite a late jumper from Alemany just before the break, the Eagles’ offense didn’t skip a beat entering the second half. Coach Sylvia Crawley and her team added to their 14-5 run in the first with an additional 17-4 run to open the first six minutes of final frame and reclaim a commanding lead of 55-44.
After the Crimson’s three-minute scoring drought, a basket from sophomore Miriam Rutzen with 13:49 remaining sparked Harvard’s offensive revival, helping the Crimson claim an impressive 16-3 run of its own to close the scoring deficit, 60-58.
“BC wasn’t the best defensive team, so we knew we could drive to the basket and we did a good job of finding the open players,” Alemany said.
Eventually, Boston College’s inside game and ability to dump it to Swords—who finished with 28 points—proved triumphant over the Harvard’s ability to thwart the defensive trap at the end of the game.
Both teams traded leads until Swords’ buzzer-beater gave the Eagles the only one that mattered.
“It was a positive game for us, even though we fell short by two points,” Matera said. “If we play like we did last night against…[any] Ivy League team, we can come out on top. This is looking good going into conference.”

Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania are together at last after New York-based graffiti artists Smart Crew unveiled their most recent masterpiece, a massive mural titled "Ivy League Vandals" that highlights the mascots and emblems of each school.
The artists at Smart Crew have been tagging together since 1997, but have never collaborated on a project thematically based on the prestigious alma maters of several members of the graffiti artist collective.
"Being known as the Smart Crew, we thought it would be relevant to use the theme of Ivy League schools. I don't think this concept has ever been used in a graffiti production, and we were inspired by the fact that we have members that have previously attended each Ivy League school," said a representative of Smart Crew who requested anonymity to avoid potential law enforcement action.
The piece went up about a month ago near JFK Airport in Queens, New York. After unveiling the mural, Smart Crew released photos on their website, an unusual move for the graffiti artist collective.
"We believe that graffiti has much more of an impact when seen in person before being seen on a computer screen. Every now and then, we will release some photos, but we would rather let the walls, trucks, and trains speak for themselves," the Smart Crew representative said.
