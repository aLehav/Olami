After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I present an economic argument in debates with my liberal friends, I often hear the counterargument that “economists only care about efficiency.” On issues ranging from free trade to price gouging, mainstream economics seemingly values efficiency over equality and social justice. The discipline, however, has a long history of promoting peace, tolerance, and benevolence.
Capitalist economics has celebrated peace since its inception in the publication of The Wealth of Nations. While Adam Smith is primarily known for his stance against government intrusion in markets, he was also a strong opponent of government involvement in imperialist conquest. During a period when nearly 70 percent of Great Britain’s non-interest expenditure was spent on a military arms race against other European imperial powers, Smith recognized that the military, “however honorable, however useful, however necessary… produces nothing for which an equal quantity of services can afterwards be procured.” In particular, Smith argued that the benefits of British monopoly in North America are not properly compensated by its cost of subduing the American colonies. The merchants are the overwhelming benefactors of imperial colonies, although British taxpayers ended up paying for military spending. At a time when Great Britain’s commercial oligarchy oppressed the American people with force, Smith laid down an economic case for self-determination.
After Smith, the neoclassical economists introduced a value-free analytical framework to economics. Most economic models, for example, assume that individuals are driven by rational self-interest, without judging the merits of their motivations. The tolerance of diverse human desires in economic models naturally translates to tolerance of human desires in society. As these models treat all individuals as equals, it becomes difficult to treat individuals differently under the law.
In the 19th century, these ideas put economists ahead of their times, firmly in opposition to bigotry and social injustices. Economists who embraced utilitarianism, such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, ardently opposed slavery and subordination of women, as discrimination based on personal traits was incoherent with their utilitarian calculus.
Recently, Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, a conservative economist, signed the Republican amicus brief in support of gay marriage, while two Wharton economists celebrated gay marriage as a mode of “hedonic marriage” that reflects the evolving economic motivation of marriage. The great Harvard economist Amartya K. Sen even offers the idea that pursuit of freedom is not just the means of economic development, but also its end. Economists’ advocacy for freedom extends much further than market freedom into other spheres of civic life.
As the benefits of free market liberalism spread in the past half-century, economists have also played a humanitarian role in many parts of the world. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, for instance, was deeply disturbed by slum dwellers’ lack of property right to the homes they live in. He advocated for a successful appropriation of property, which enriched more than a million impoverished Peruvians living in dire conditions. Works of economists like de Soto shows that economics does not only encourage prosperity through free trade, but it also builds institutions that can sustain economic prosperity. Today, one of the most exciting fields of economics is development economics, which aims to replicate the success of Western institutions in the poorest countries. A discipline that prides itself on utility maximization cannot ignore the low-hanging fruit of alleviating the poverty of millions in the world.
Since mainstream economics is largely a value-free framework with an obsession with optimization, it is easy to dismiss economics as a “soulless” social science. This characterization, however, ignores other values of economics that are just as inherent in economic models. These values make up the soul of economics and have upheld a long and proud tradition of peace, tolerance, and benevolence. It is a tradition that should be preserved and celebrated.

Last December, the Newtown shooting nudged America out of its gun control inertia, the gravitational pull of tragedy overcoming the friction of the National Rifle Association. New York limited the capacity of ammunition clips to seven rounds. Colorado markedly expanded background checks. President Obama has championed similar federal legislation, including an assault weapons ban in his package.
 Scarcely 100 days later, though, Congress has done nothing, and the blame rests largely with Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid. In drafting a bill for the consideration of the full Senate, Reid stripped out the assault weapons ban promoted by Obama, reasoning that it had no chance of passage thanks to the filibuster.
 There is reason to doubt the sincerity of Reid’s pragmatic murmurings. For one, it is because of him that major legislation still needs the backing of a supermajority. As the Senate commenced its new session, a few members of the Democratic caucus, frustrated with the chamber’s paraplegic pace, took up the subject of a filibuster overhaul. One proposal would have mandated filibustering senators to speak on the floor for the duration of their legislative blockade. Another would have put the onus on obstructionists, allowing the majority to end debate on a bill unless the minority garnered 41 votes on a filibuster motion. Cutting a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the majority leader scotched both ideas, opting for modest changes that have not shocked the body out of its paralysis. 
 Then there’s Reid’s history. In 1993 and 2004, the senator from Nevada voted against the assault weapons ban. Two years afterward, he supported a bill that insulated weapons manufacturers from a bevy of negligence lawsuits. In 2010, he went to a shooting range with Wayne LaPierre, the gun lobby’s executive vice president. As the political clout of Nevada’s rural sector has waned, Reid has shifted to the left. Nonetheless, the senator’s previously cozy relationship with the NRA is highly disconcerting, raising questions about his commitment to advancing gun control. 
 Hopes for new legislation remain alive. Last week, Obama delivered an impassioned plea for action that refocused attention on the matter. And in an attempt to counter the NRA’s might, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is funding a $12 million advertising blitz that frames firearms safety in a persuasive, culturally competent manner. At the State of the Union, the president declared that the Newtown victims and their families deserve a vote. But they won’t get their vote as long as Obama fails to win Reid’s.

As I’m waiting for a genetics lecture to begin, I watch a girl do something we’re all familiar with—organize her day into a schedule: 1:00-2:30, LS1b lecture; 2:30-2:40, mocha latte from Greenhouse Café and walk back to dorm; 2:40-4:00, math p-set; 4:00-4:10, write professor email.
4:10-4:15, bathroom.
Okay, that’s just weird.
Whenever I ask people how they’re doing, it seems like the most common response is “busy.” Busy busy busy. A Bokononist would be proud. There seems to be a certain kind of pride behind telling others how you have two midterms tomorrow, how you’ve gotten six hours of sleep over the past two days, how you don’t have time go out for lunch this weekend or next Saturday but maybe a quick, super-quick, Burdick’s run on Sunday might work out. Maybe. Thoroughly filling out schedules seems like the right thing to do; we all want to succeed, so why not pack in as many classes, sports, clubs, and social events as possible, and let sleep take up the rest? Isn’t any unorganized free time an unproductive waste of our precious few years at Harvard? People rarely take a moment to catch their breath, so they never get a chance to even ask themselves if they should be this busy.
So let’s take a moment to breathe. When we have so many planned activities, the usual response is multitasking, and the usual outcome is unenjoyable inefficiency. Rather than cutting down, we double up (or triple up); we write up emails during lecture, read for our Gen Ed on the elliptical, or study while we eat. The net result is an information overload that physically prevents our brains from working at their full capacity. Multitasking gives us an illusion of efficiency and a reality of ineffectiveness that generally results in sub-optimal work.
Furthermore, we enjoy activities a lot less when our minds are directed elsewhere. We feel burdened by our obligations, even if we create them by our own volition. It’s hard to focus on a science p-set when you’re thinking about that op-ed you have to write, and it’s hard to write that op-ed when you’re thinking about that science p-set you have to do. The amount of pleasure we derive from activities is directly proportional to how engaged we are in them, so if our minds and bodies are in two separate places, we cannot truly appreciate an activity. As research suggests, we can only focus on one thing at a time, so why not focus on the task at hand? And if that can’t be done because a schedule is packed, we help both our efficiency and our engagement by freeing up our schedules.
Simply opening up a schedule for one activity at a time, however, is not enough, because leisure is an important part of a happy, balanced life. Studies have shown that we focus better after we take breaks, and we’re definitely happier when we do. By leisure, I don’t mean binge-watching Breaking Bad or refreshing the texts on your iPhone so frequently that it turns into a callisthenic exercise; I mean actively using your mind for something that you find meaningful. Maybe it’s chatting with a friend on Facebook, but maybe it’s taking the time to write about your day, read that book you always said you would get to over vacation, or reflect about your life. I don’t mean to say that doing so many activities can’t be intrinsically rewarding, but there is definitely something unique about absolving yourself of any commitments for an hour or two and letting your mind wander, letting your whim decide what’s next.
Don’t feel the need to do everything. When we try to take advantage of everything Harvard has to offer, our schedules take advantage of us. I don’t want to suggest that we shouldn’t make schedules; they can be effective ways of structuring the day. But when we’re at the point where efficiency dictates our bowel movements, I think it’s high time to realize that we’re making our lives busier than they need to be. And I don’t want to suggest that we shouldn’t ever be busy; working hard now can definitely pay off later. But when we compromise our sleep to the point where we are clinically drunk, we’re just paying now for no return later.
When we deny ourselves leisure, we deprive ourselves of serenity and ease. We lose the freedom and bliss of a day spent on our own terms. Leisure isn’t idleness; it’s the freedom of action from the release of commitment. Leisure isn’t a luxury either—it’s a necessity. So, every once in a while, when you look at a floor covered with English drafts and math p-sets and lab reports and textbooks and research articles, don’t forget to breathe, don’t forget to reflect on your life, don’t forget to ask yourself whether what you’re doing is enhancing your development as a person. After all, that’s what we’re all here to do, right?

When Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez died in early February, his country was thrown into a period of national mourning as the political equilibrium in Latin America hung in the balance. As Venezuela chooses its next president, Washington should seek to reverse the current trend of acrid relations between the two nations and engage with the Venezuelan government in Caracas toward stability and prosperity in the Western hemisphere.
While it might seem likely that relations between the United States and Venezuela would naturally improve after the death of the combative Chávez, the opposite now seems more likely. Before passing away, Chávez had handpicked a successor in Nicholas Maduro, who has assumed power in the interim before the presidential election in April. As Chávez’s handpicked successor, Maduro has already continued with his mentor’s trend of using anti-American rhetoric to bring popularity to his government, even declaring that American agents may have infected Chávez with the cancer that killed him. While Washington has officially declared that it is committed to a more functional relationship with Venezuela, its actions have not been consistent with this idea: The United States offered no official condolences for Chávez’s death, and both nations have started expelling diplomats from the other. Neither nation, it seems, is steering toward more congenial relations with the other.
Admittedly, the United States has good reason to be less than enthused about more Chávez-style governance in Venezuela. Calling himself a 21st-century socialist, Chávez nationalized the lucrative oil industry, developed strong trade and diplomatic relationships with Iran and Cuba, repeatedly decried the United States as an imperialist force, and cooperated with the Iranians in developing nuclear technology. Engaging in petty diplomat-expulsion spats, however, is no way to deal with any of these problems, and it in fact only strengthens the Chavistas’ hold on their country. The diplomatic and economic opportunities that would stem from greater engagement would far outweigh the meager benefits reaped from our current policies.
Diplomatically, positive engagement with Venezuela would be a major step toward building American credibility in the world at large, especially in Latin America. Chávez (along with his friends the Castros in Cuba) was able to bolster regional support for his regime by pointing out the United States’ attempts to forcibly intervene in Venezuelan politics. Soon, a number of populist governments in Latin America had rallied around Chávez and his anti-American policies. In 2004, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and three Caribbean nations joined with Venezuela and Cuba to form the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America, an organization in direct opposition to the Free Trade Area in the Americas proposed (but never realized) by the Bush administration. Chávez galvanized these nations—many of whom have experienced American interventionist tactics—by vilifying America as a common, imperial enemy.
Unfortunately for the United States, its general strategy regarding Venezuela has often strengthened Chávez’s position. Every time Washington chastises Venezuela for opposing American interests or attempts to bring sanctions against the Latin American country, the leader in Caracas (whether it be Chávez or Maduro) simply gains more evidence toward his claim that Washington is a neo-colonialist meddler. This weakens the United States’ diplomatic position, while simultaneously strengthening Venezuela’s. If Washington wants Latin America to stop its current trend of electing leftist, Chavista governments, its first step should be to adopt a less astringent tone in dealing with Venezuela. Caracas will be unable to paint Washington as an aggressor, and Washington will in turn gain a better image in Latin America.
Beyond leading to more amicable, cooperative relationships with Latin American nations, engagement with Venezuela would also be economically advisable. With the world’s largest oil reserves, countless other valuable resources, and stunning natural beauty to attract scores of tourists, Venezuela has quite a bit to offer economically. Even now, America can see the possible benefits of economic engagement with Caracas by looking at one of the few extant cases of such cooperation: Each year, thousands of needy Americans are able to keep their homes heated because of the cooperation between Venezuela and a Boston-area oil company.
Engagement with Venezuela would also lead to stronger economic cooperation with the entirety of Latin America. It was mostly through Venezuela’s efforts that the United States was unable to create a “Free Trade Area of the Americas,” an endeavor that would have eliminated most trade barriers among participant nations, thereby leading to more lucrative trade. In a world where the United States and Venezuela were to enjoy normalized relations, all nations involved would benefit from such agreements.
For both diplomatic and economic reasons, then, positive engagement is the best course of action for the United States.  As it stands, the negative relationship between the countries has created an atmosphere of animosity in the hemisphere, hindering dialogue and making economic cooperation nearly impossible. While there is much for which the Venezuelan government can rightly be criticized—authoritarian rule, abuse of human rights, lack of market-friendly policies—nothing that the United States is doing to counter those drawbacks is having any effect. The United States should stop playing “tough guy” with Venezuela, bite the bullet, and work toward stability and prosperity for the entire hemisphere. We aren’t catching any flies with our vinegar—it’s high time we started trying to catch them with honey.

Harvard announced the 10 team finalists for the first-ever Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge on Monday.
Faculty and alumni judges selected the finalists from a pool of 70 applications submitted to the Challenge, one of two dean-sponsored contests hosted at the Harvard Innovation Lab this year.
The finalists will each receive $5,000, the guidance of an experienced mentor, and space in the i-lab to continue developing their projects. The winning team and as many as four runners-up will split $75,000 at the Challenge’s culmination in May.
The Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge charged student teams across the University to develop sustainable solutions for expanding the role of the arts in society.
“[Cultural entrepreneurs] try to provide the infrastructure to help support arts and artists or enable arts and artists to have a greater impact on society,” Harvard Business School professor Mukti V. Khaire said.
Paul H. Smith, a member of a team finalist, Music+1, said that the interplay between art and business is at the core of his team’s proposal.
“While [Music+1] has to be a successful business, at its heart, it has musical and cultural goals,” he said.
Music+1 is a mobile application that accompanies a musician playing concertos, sonatas, or chamber music, and adjusts the speed and volume of the accompaniment to match the soloist’s style in real-time.
Other finalist proposals include the use of 3-D printing to allow the visually impaired to “see” paintings through touch, as well as the creation of a nonprofit organization in India proposing to build partnerships between government, artists, and designers to create civic engagement in governance.
“Creative cultural entrepreneurship is something that I’ve been aspiring to for a long time,” said HBS student Emily A. Rasmussen, the team leader of Art&Venue, formerly CreativeSPACES. Art&Venue is an online platform where emerging artists can find and book venues for their work.
Khaire said that Harvard’s involvement in the challenge is important because of the University’s unique ability to “validate new ideas.”
“By putting its name behind the Challenge, Harvard stands to really emphasize to society the impact of arts and culture to our lives, to make cultural entrepreneurship a much more valid and accepted career path,” she said.
The Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge is one of three innovation contests initiated by the University this year. The Deans’ Health and Life Science Challenge finalists will be announced this month; the President’s Challenge finalists were announced March 25.

Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers voted to ratify their new contract on Tuesday, marking the official end of the union’s longest ever negotiations with the University.
According to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, the unofficial results at press time were that approximately 97 percent of the 2,400 union members who voted chose to ratify the new contract.
“It’s really impressive that so many members of the union took [the vote] so seriously, and that’s the way people have responded through this whole struggle,” Jaeger said. “I think our members really care about the issues we’ve been working on and have a lot of energy and commitment.”
The University also reiterated its support for the contract as well as the positive relationship between both parties.
“We are very pleased that HUCTW members have supported this agreement, which we believe is fair for the University and the members of the HUCTW,” wrote Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann in a statement to the Crimson. “We value and recognize the important role that HUCTW members play every day at Harvard, and we look forward to moving ahead together with the work of the University.”
HUCTW’s constitution mandates that tentative contracts be confirmed by a vote of the members. Accordingly, the union has held a paper vote on every contract it has negotiated. Voting took place between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Tuesday at 70 different locations across Harvard’s main campus and off campus locations.
Both sides announced a tentative agreement in March after they have been negotiating since the old contract expired on July 1, 2012. The new contract includes a first year retroactive wage increase of 3.4 percent for the typical union member with at least one year of service at the University, followed by two more increases in the following two years.
The new contract does not provide a definitive solution to many of the health care issues central to the negotiations. Instead, it provides for the creation of a special committee on health care that will work on an ongoing basis.
Jaeger said that HUCTW has held approximately 60 meetings in the past two weeks to educate its members about the details of the contract and to promote discussion before the ratification vote.
Mary Medlin, who works in the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department, said that attending one of these meetings influenced her decision to ratify the contract.
“They explained the process and why they felt it was a fair contract...So that was the final tally for me,” Medlin said.

Mark D. Gearan ’78, President of the  Hobart and William Smith Colleges, returned to his alma mater on Tuesday to discuss public service and his experiences in service and politics in the Winthrop House Senior Common room.
Gearan, a former Peace Corps Director and White House Deputy Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton, began the discussion by addressing members of the millennial generation in the audience.
“From my perspective, your generation is the most civically-engaged and volunteer-minded since the greatest generation, without question,” Gearan said.
However, he also noted a paradox within public service. He said that he believes members of the millennial generation have a strong interest in service and making a difference in their communities, but a few wants to do so by entering government service. Gearan stressed that, in order to make a difference, the country needs civic-minded people interested in running for office.
“There’s a great interest in service, a great interest in making a difference,’ he said. “But how do we insure that people are thinking about this in terms of government?”
Gearan also discussed the challenges that young people encounter when they attempt to get involved in public service: in particular, money.
“Sadly, for anyone thinking about running for office, the resources required are difficult to attain,” he said.
“It’s a significant problem...an insidious cycle for anyone starting and tough for anyone once they are serving.”
Gearan also detailed the disfunctionality in government that arises from extreme partisanship, which further prevents any action from being taken in politics on issues that liberals and conservatives greatly disagree on.
Tianhao He ’16, who is working as a research assistant at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he enjoyed Gearan’s discussion.
“I really appreciated hearing Mark Gearan’s perspective on the potential for young people to get involved in public service,” He said.
He added that it is inspiring to think about how people can build a national movement on public service.
Gearan’s daughter, Madeleine H. Gearan ’15, also shared her persepective on her father’s work.
“My dad has had a long career in public life and politics,” she said.
“Growing up as the daughter of someone who’s committed his entire life to public service has been such a great privilege.”

Attendees filled the  John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday night as panelists discussed the newly appointed Pope’s influence on the direction of the Catholic Church.
Moderated by Melinda Henneberger, political writer for The Washington Post and Politics and Public Policy Fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, the panel began with an examination of the waves that Pope Francis has made since his appointment.
From his refusal to move into the Apostolic Palace to his choice to spend Easter with young convicts, Pope Francis, the first Argentinian and the first Jesuit Pope, has demonstrated a departure from the traditional European papal presence of the past millennium.
Public Policy Professor Mary Jo Bane noted that the Pope’s style brings a “kind of different image to the church.” The Pope’s namesake, Saint Francis, was known for compassion and care for the poor.
“If he can restore some of the moral authority of the church, he really can be a stronger voice for the poor and vulnerable on the world stage,” Bane said.
Bane also voiced hopes for greater inclusivity and transparency in the institution of the church.
According to panelist John Carr, former Executive Director of the Department of Justice, Peace and Human Development at the United States Catholic Bishops’ Conference, the new pope brings the potential that the “Church and society will look beyond the obsessive concerns of human sexuality.”
The final member of the panel, Kennedy School Professor Father J. Bryan Hehir, said that Pope Francis faces major struggles in the months to come.
Hehir said the new pope must be able to “project his own faith intelligibly” in order to inspire faith around him, adding that the Pope also faces a massive institutional restructuring to combat the sexual abuse crisis worldwide. Hehir said Pope Francis cannot risk losing his message in the politics of reform. Instead, his appointments take responsibility for restructuring the institution of the Church, leaving Francis “a teacher, voice of the human rights, and voice of the poor,” he said.
Hehir added that the Pope faces the issue of instituting more transparency and more inclusivity in the Church, a dilemma that may be mitigated by appointing a more diverse set of people to run the Vatican.
Hennenberger referenced Pope Francis’ Easter homily on the role of women disciples of the Easter gospel in combination with his inclusion of women in the Holy Thursday ritual of washing feet–previously in conflict with canon law–as possible indicators of a future shift in gender politics in the church.
Carr noted, however, that Francis remains “an old guy elected by old guys.”

UPDATED: April 4, 2013, at 2:06 a.m.
Stanford University will collaborate with edX to advance the virtual learning initiative’s open source platform that will be released publicly in June, Stanford and edX announced Wednesday.
Stanford intends to incorporate key features of its current internal software for online courses, Class2Go, with the edX platform. By collaborating with Stanford, edX says that they hope the online platform’s technological infrastructure will be improved.
“This collaboration brings together two leaders in online education in a common effort to ensure that the world’s universities have the strongest possible non-profit open-source platform available to them,” said John C. Mitchell, Stanford’s vice provost for online learning, in a statement.
Stanford and its faculty have been trailblazers in providing accessible education online. It has a longstanding partnership with iTunes U, and members of Stanford’s computer science faculty also founded the for-profit online education platforms Coursera and Udacity.
Currently, Stanford does not plan to upload university courses on the edX platform and will instead focus on edX’s technical development, according to a press release.
The university will continue to maintain its relationships with Coursera and Udacity, among other platforms, to offer various avenues for faculty to leverage their coursework virtually.
“We will continue to use multiple online learning platforms and determine which platform and approach best serves the educational goals put forward by our faculty and what best matches their interests,” Mitchell said in a press release. “But we will focus our development efforts on a single, open source platform which makes the most efficient use of our time and resources.”
EdX leaders anticipate that open source software, which is publicly available, free, and usable by any developer, will encourage communal and international participation in its technological advancement.
Universities will be able to specify delivery methods, data collection, and branding through their access to the code.
“It has been our vision to offer our platform as open source since edX’s founding by Harvard and MIT,” said edX President Anant Agarwal in a statement. “We are realizing that vision, and I am pleased to welcome Stanford University, one of the world’s leading institutions of higher education, to further this global open source solution.”

After a breakout week in which included back-to-back hat tricks in the men’s lacrosse team’s game against Albany and Duke, sophomore Murphy Vandervelde has earned Athlete of the Week honors from The Crimson. Here are some other great performances by Harvard athletes from this past week:
Kristen Norton, Women’s Tennis
In the her team’s final non-conference match, co-captain Kristen Norton won at the line one doubles position with partner and co-captain Hideko Tachibana to help the Crimson defeat Syracuse, 6-1. Norton and Tachibana’s 8-3 win over Maddie Kobelt and Brittany Lashway made the pair 6-0 on the season. Norton also defeated Jimena Wu of Syracuse 6-0, 6-0 at the line three singles as Harvard earned its fifth straight victory at the Murr Center.
Morgan Groom, Softball
Freshman pitcher Morgan Groom threw two complete games this past week as the softball team began its Ancient Eight play. Groom stuck out three and allowed six hits in Friday’s 6-3 loss to Penn. On Saturday, Groom earned her first Ivy League win in the team’s 4-1 victory over Columbia. The freshman tallied five strikeouts and only gave up four hits in her seven innings of work.
Nick Madden, Men’s Volleyball
Junior co-captain Nick Madden was all over the court for the Crimson in Saturday’s sweep of Erskine College. Madden was second on the team with eight kills while leading Harvard in blocks and digs, with and four, respectively. Harvard’s 25-20, 25-23, 25-19 victory was the team’s eleventh straight win at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Oliver Lee, Men’s Swimming
Junior Oliver Lee swan in two relays and an individual event for the Crimson this past weekend at the NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships. Lee swam the 50m freestyle in a time of 19.98, which was good for 19th overall. The junior followed that performance by helping the men’s 200m freestyle relay team to a 19th place finish and the men’s 400m freestyle relay team to a 22nd place finish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After completing a four-game road trip to start the Ivy season, the Crimson started its twelve game home stand with a contest against Providence. Harvard grabbed the lead early, but the Crimson (9-15, 2-2) proved unable to hang on against the Friars (10-17-1), losing 5-3.
Junior Kasey Lange started the Crimson off strong, blasting a solo home run in the bottom of the first. The Friars responded in the third inning, stringing together three singles to plate their first runner of the game.
Harvard was able to load the bases with one in the bottom of the inning, but could not manage to drive in any more runs. Providence broke away with three runs over the next two innings. Lange led off the fifth for the Crimson with another solo home run, and the Crimson scored again in the sixth. But it was not enough.
“There were some bright spots, such as the two home runs—we were just missing things that we can fix,” freshman Morgan Groom said. “It was things such as scoring runs and executing pitches.”
Harvard amassed 13 hits, its largest total of the season, but left a combined 14 runners on base. Along with the two home runs from Lange, senior Stephanie Regan and sophomore Katherine Appelbe hit doubles on the afternoon. Providence, on the other hand, plated five runners despite recording only one extra base hit.
“I think we’re really close to turning a huge corner,” said Lange. “We’re getting a lot of runners on base, but our focus now is just coming up with a few clutch hits to score those runs.”
Thus far, Lange has proved to be the Crimson’s most clutch player. Her two home runs give her a total of eight for the season, placing her second in the Ivy League, behind Yale’s Sarah Onorato, who has nine. Lange ranks fourth in the Ancient Eight with 19 RBIs.
Once again, the freshman pair of Jamie Halula and Groom took the mound for the Crimson. Halula started the game for Harvard, giving up 2 runs, six hits, and one walk in four innings of work. She also struck out two batters in picking up the loss. Groom, who has the principal starter in recent contests, came into relief to finish the game. She gave up only three hits, but along with these came an equal amount of runs.
“I don’t know their names, but the middle of their line-up did a good job of producing with runners on base,” said Lange. “They got the hits when they needed them, and we were unable to make that execution.”
This year’s game marks the 34th time these two teams have met. Last year, the Crimson dropped a 3-2 decision to the Friars.  Providence leads the all-time series 20-12-1 with the last Crimson win coming in 2010.
The Crimson has played many close games this season, losing many of these contests because the team has struggled to pull together all its strengths. Whether it has been fielding or pitching or stringing together hits, the players’ acknowledge that the team’s game has yet to fully click on all cylinders.
“I think we’re really close to turning a huge corner,” Lange said. “We’re getting a lot of runners on base, but our focus now is just coming up with a few clutch hits to score those runs.
In three home games this season, the Crimson has only won one game. Still, the players acknowledge the comfort Soldiers Field brings them.
“We are really excited to be home for awhile,” Lange added. “March is so much fun for us, but five weekends straight on the road is tough on any team. We love our field and our fans and can’t wait to play some more games in front of them.”
After a brief respite, Harvard returns to the Ancient Eight grind, hosting back-to-back doubleheaders this weekend—Princeton on Friday and Cornell on Saturday. These games mark the quarter-way point of Ivy League play, and the Crimson believe they certainly have the ability to knock the games out of the park.
“We can definitely win all four games,” Groom said. “We have the people to-definitely have a chance to win every game we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
27 March 2013
Dear Harvard Community,
On behalf of our basketball program, I can’t thank you enough for the amazing outpouring that has enveloped our team during and since our recent NCAA Tournament experience.  We have been truly humbled by the incredible support that has been shown to us from all corners of our university.  We feel privileged to be a part of this community with you, and we were honored to represent Harvard over the past weeks.  As Laurent Rivard ’14 responded to a reporter’s question at our NCAA press conference, “…Everybody at Harvard, not just the basketball team, but everybody has other talents [besides just] being smart.”   It has been a unique privilege for everyone in our program to write one small page in the Harvard story.
It has been a thrilling few weeks, but we want to thank you as well for the constant support all year long, which propelled us to our 3rd straight Ivy League title and our historic NCAA win.   To the band, cheer teams, faculty, staff and all members of the Harvard Community, THANK YOU!
As always, a very special THANK YOU to our students!  They continue to fight for our team in a positive manner that is truly representative of this great institution.  I continue to be very proud of what you do—and how you do it.
Congratulations!!  Thank you!!  And Go Crimson!
Coach Tommy Amaker

Breakfast at Tiffany's
 Nothing brings sophistication to a dorm room like an eight-dollar poster of Audrey Hepburn. As she coolly surveys your scattered party dresses and unmade bed, Audrey is confident in you. Your secret—that your "pearl" earrings are from Forever 21—will be safe with her. If Holly Golightly can go from country bumpkin to Manhattan socialite, surely you can nail down that coffee-fetching publishing internship in New York this summer. Or at least learn to do your laundry a classier number of times per month.
 
Albert Einstein
 Yes, you're a physics concentrator. Yes, you spend the majority of your time either sweating over your special relativity p-sets or explaining to your friends why they should really appreciate special relativity more. You probably own multiple bowties, and maybe a collector's edition Albert Einstein action figurine. If you happen to stare bleary-eyed at your wall after submitting your beautiful LaTex labors, it's always nice to have reassurance that someone else in this world also thought that Physics was fun, and that that person was cool enough to stick out his tongue every once in a while.
 
Keep Calm and Carry On 
 You know nothing of British culture or history, but you love the Queen of England and wish to channel her ways. She is poised. She has a flock of corgis. She has terrific-looking grandchildren. She even parachuted into the 2012 London Olympics. While bombs were dropping all around London during World War II, she calmly sat in her bunker, as cool as the cucumbers in her finger sandwiches. That's who you want to be. All the trappings of aristocracy—tiaras, excellent education, and mottos to keep calm—will get you through this paper. You will be Queen of Papers. Chances are that you also have a plaque that says "Dance like nobody's watching" somewhere on your bookshelf.
 
John Belushi, "COLLEGE"
 Nobody has seen "Animal House." Your dad may have referenced the movie once or twice, and he seemed to really appreciate the poster when he came to visit during Freshman Parents' Weekend. You haven't seen your dad get that misty-eyed in a while. That first week of freshman year, John Belushi's gaze seemed to follow you around the room and his lips seemed to whisper: beer pong. The secret to the universe. Girls would fall at your feet with every sunken cup. AEPi boys would worship you. You studied the sport with discipline: every arc and wrist movement mattered. The poster has since been grafitti'd with house rules and various pong configurations scrawled in magic marker, including "The Neil Diamond," "Naked Lap," and "Dance Cup." The poster was your inspiration, John Belushi your spirit guide—and now you're going to be one of the six bros living in the frat house next year, just like your dad always dreamed of.
 
Bob Marley 
 Why are there seven fans on full blast in your room in the middle of winter? Why is there no toilet paper in the bathroom? These are the questions your roommate's parents will undoubtedly ask you, but it's okay. Everything's gonna be alright. Even though you and your friends may have taken a piece of classroom chalk and drawn an intense alien mural depicting peace, submarines, and French existentialism all over the walls of the Phoenix last night, you're pretty sure everything is going to be alright. Though you may have eaten four burritos in one sitting that same night. That may not be alright. Looks like we're going to have to skip Ec 10 today.
 
"Pulp Fiction"
 Since your parents banned violent movies in high school to protect your younger brother, you hadn't seen this movie when you bought the poster. But then your eyes were opened—you watched "Pulp Fiction" and relished in its lurid gratuitous violence. You are now cultured, and it's a constant reminder that only the squeamish fail to consider Quentin an artiste. The poster was a good investment. It shows that you've seen grisly things, you've seen them with your own eyes. It is the proof that you have undergone the rite of passage that turned you from a noob into a full-fledged adult. Because sometimes people ask you for proof.
