After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rows of laptops displaying programs ranging from a website tracking the exact location of the Harvard shuttle to a dating site just for Harvard undergraduates can only mean one thing: This is CS50—the fair.
Students, faculty, and members of the Cambridge community filled Northwest Labs on Monday afternoon to test out the final projects of the 714 students enrolled in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” Attendees munched on cupcakes and played with stress balls with the CS50 logo while trying out student projects like “HUDS Creations,” a website displaying user-submitted recipes made from ingredients found in Harvard dining halls.
Monday’s CS50 fair marked the fifth year the event has taken place. David J. Malan ’99, the computer science lecturer who teaches the course, said that while the format of the fair has remained relatively unchanged since it started, the platforms and applications used by students in their final projects have become more “mobile and web-based.”
“We’re seeing that it’s increasingly possible to do amazing things,” Malan said of the work produced by his students.
Sprinkled among the laptops were mobile phones boasting student-created applications, including an alarm clock for BlackBerry devices that encourages users to stay awake by forcing them to solve a mental puzzle instead of just hitting snooze.
Ryan Lee ’15, a teaching fellow for the course, said the fair captures the essence of a class as innovative as CS50.
“If you learn something in a class and you never apply it, you really get stuck in that ivory tower, and you never learn how everything you did applies to the outside world,” Lee said.
Jessica T. Reese ’16 used the final project as an opportunity to transform her book review blog into a streamlined website.
Reese said although she was entirely unexposed to computer science before this semester, she gained much from the course.
And, she said, the lessons she learned from CS50 are applicable far beyond the course. Reese said she feels that “anything is possible” after creating her website: “You just have to keep trying and persevere,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Graduate School of Education Kathleen McCartney will leave her post at Harvard to become president of Smith College next summer.
“It’s a little bittersweet, of course, because I absolutely love the Graduate School of Education,” McCartney said of accepting the position at Smith, which she will begin on July 1, 2013.
During her eight years as dean of the Ed School, McCartney expanded degree offerings and increased financial aid packages for students at the school.
McCartney said that although she has enjoyed her time as dean, she thinks the Ed School will benefit from a new leader.
“It’s good for an institution to have someone with a fresh perspective,” she said.
In a press release, University President Drew G. Faust praised McCartney for her “constant commitment to high standards and innovation.”
“[McCartney] has strengthened and energized the faculty, increased student aid, deepened the School’s connections with other parts of the University, and elevated its impact on the world of education far beyond Harvard,” Faust said.
In 2009, McCartney guided the school in launching its Doctor of Education Leadership program. The three-year program, the first of its kind, accepts 25 mid-career professionals each year from a variety of fields.
The program is fully funded by Harvard and aims to help students develop the skills to become leaders in American education reform.
Ed.L.D students spend two years at Harvard, where they take Ed School classes and are able to enroll in elective courses at the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government. In their third year, students serve as residents at educational organizations ranging from the New York City Department of Education to Teach for America.
McCartney said she thinks the Ed.L.D. program is crucial to addressing the issues plaguing the American education system.
“Education really is the civil rights issue of our time. There’s just no doubt about that,” McCartney said.
“I think Harvard’s role in education reform is to produce the kind of education leaders that the field needs.”
During her tenure, Harvard also conceptualized a Ph.D in Education in Education—a degree offering which is set to launch in 2014. The interdisciplinary program will draw its faculty from across the University.
McCartney said during her time at Harvard she has worked to diversify the Ed School’s faculty and student body. Forty percent of the faculty appointed by McCartney have been people of color, and financial aid for masters students has doubled under her leadership.
“I’ve tried to remove all of the barriers to studying here,” she said.
McCartney said she is looking forward to taking the helm of Smith College.
“I’ve known for a while that I wanted to do one more big thing, and this opportunity at Smith feels just right to me,” she said.
McCartney’s research focuses on maternal employment and childcare, a focus which she has developed into an executive education program at the Ed School called “Women in Leadership.” McCartney said that given this academic interest, she expects to thrive at all-women’s college Smith.
“Women’s issues are something I care very passionately about, so this feels like a very good fit,” McCartney said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team’s power play woes continued Friday night as the University of Massachusetts Lowell (5-7-1, 3-6-1 Hockey East) overpowered the No. 18 Crimson (4-4-1, 3-3-0, ECAC), 5-0, at Bright Hockey Center.
Just four seconds into the River Hawks’ first power play of the game, UML defenseman Chad Ruhwedel beamed a slapshot past the glove of goaltender Raphael Gerard for the River Hawks’ second goal.
The strike seemed to mock Harvard’s own power play efforts as the Crimson finished the night 0-for-5 with the man advantage. Heading into the winter break, Harvard now sits 2-for-32 on the power play this year, a far cry from last season’s NCAA-leading 27.3 percent success rate.
“Our power play was pretty much indicative of our overall offensive game tonight,” Crimson head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We got bumped off too many pucks [and] lost too many puck battles.”
The River Hawks controlled the game from start to finish as three different UML defenders scored the game’s first three goals. Heading into the game, the River Hawks’ six defenders had combined for only one goal on the season.
“We really challenged our defensemen these last few weeks to contribute,” UML coach Norm Bazin said. “This week they kind of broke out.”
Freshman defender Dmitry Sinitsyn opened up the scoring just over six minutes into the game with a long wrist shot that found its way through a screen and into the back of the net. The scoring continued to come from unexpected sources for UML as Ruhwedel converted quickly on the power play nine minutes later for his first goal of the season.
The River Hawks outshot Harvard, 15-9, in the first period and continued to limit the Crimson’s chances in the second.
“After it was 2-0, I thought we had plenty of chances…but when it was all said and done, they won a lot more battles than we did, everything from face-offs to blocking shots,” Donato said.
Following a scoreless second period, Harvard’s offense began to find some opportunities in front of goal, but River Hawks defenseman Jake Suter slapped another puck into the net from the point with less than six minutes left in regulation.
Girard protested the goal, claiming goaltender interference, but the mark stood. With UML three goals up on the home team, the game seemed out of reach, even for a resurgent Crimson offense that was getting pucks to the net with more consistency in the third period.
Desperate for a spark, Harvard pulled Girard for an extra attacker with over three minutes left, but the hard-pressing Crimson offense collapsed defensively as Girard rushed back onto the ice in a failed bid to defend against a 3-on-0 rush from the River Hawks. UML forward Scott Wilson deked around Girard for an easy fourth goal.
Tensions began to flare as junior Crimson defenseman John Caldwell sent Suter barreling into the UML net with an after-whistle hit. A tussle ensued behind the net as Caldwell, Suter, Harvard’s Conor Morrison and UML’s Derek Arnold were issued game misconducts.
The Crimson’s frustration continued to boil over as senior defenseman Brendan Rempel was sent to the box for slashing to give the River Hawks a two-man advantage with just over a minute left. UML converted easily as forward Joseph Pendenza chipped in the fifth goal of the night.
UML freshman goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who has recorded back-to-back shutouts, made 32 saves. Girard finished with 27.
“Their goaltender was excellent, but I don’t think we really challenged him enough to make him uncomfortable at any point,” Donato said.
Donato complimented the manner in which the River Hawks were able to create problems for Girard.
“There were elements of their game that, quite frankly, we need to incorporate into our game,” Donato said. “They put pucks on net, but more importantly, they put pucks on net with people going there [and with] a lot of traffic in front of the net.”
Friday was the first match-up between the two squads since December 2001. The visitors left the Bright Hockey Center after handing the Crimson its worst home loss by goal differential since a 10-1 drubbing at the hands of the University of North Dakota in 2008.
Harvard now has a 19-day break in its schedule as it seeks to make adjustments on both ends of the ice. The Crimson will face Northeastern at home on December 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number 22 haunted the Harvard women’s basketball team in its 68-61 overtime loss to Boston University at Case Gymnasium Monday.
For one, the Crimson (7-3) committed 22 turnovers against the Terriers (8-3), including a trio of fatal mistakes in extra time. Harvard jumped out to a 61-57 lead in OT but BU responded with a 6-0 run fueled by a steal that led to a layup.
While the teams were still separated by just one possession, the Crimson squandered its next two opportunities by sailing a pass out of bounds and committing a double-dribble violation. On the other end, the Terriers converted on its free throws to put the game away, snapping Harvard’s four-game win streak that dated back to Thanksgiving.
“When it gets down to the wire like that, we can’t have turnovers like that, and unfortunately we made a couple of mistakes,” senior forward Victoria Lippert said. “We got good shots too, but they weren’t falling, so just unfortunate that it didn’t go our way this time.”
Overtime could have been avoided when, with 22 seconds left in regulation, sophomore Temi Fagbenle stepped to the line for two shots with her squad down one point. But the forward missed her first attempt before salvaging the trip by converting her second shot to tie the game at 57. It would go into extra time after BU airballed a shot at the buzzer.
Harvard couldn’t overcome its mistakes due in part to the play of No. 22 on its roster, junior Christine Clark. The guard leads the Ivy League in points per game this season but recorded fewer than 10 points Monday for the first time this year. She finished with eight points on 4-of-13 shooting to go with six rebounds.
Clark also tallied four assists and eight turnovers while serving as the primary ball handler for much of the night as sophomore starting point guard Ali Curtis sat for the final 17 minutes of the second half and overtime. Curtis played just 16 minutes, her second lowest total of the year.
Even still, the Crimson almost came away with a victory. The teams fought a close battle near the end of regulation, knotting the score three times in the final five minutes. The last three minutes brought a struggle for Harvard though, as its only point scored came on Fagbenle’s free throw.
The Crimson struggled on offense throughout the second half, making just 33 percent of its shots from the field in the period and going one-for-12 from behind the arc after halftime.
“We got good looks, but in a game like that, you need them to fall in order to win,” Lippert said. “Our shots were good, so we’ll hit them next time.”
BU, on the other hand, went 10-for-24 from distance in the game, led by senior Chantell Alford, who was 4-for-10 on three-point attempts. Alford led all scorers with 23 on the night.
One of her treys came during a 9-0 run that tied the game at 39 after Harvard opened what would be the biggest lead of the night at 39-30.
While the Terriers were doing damage from the deep, the Crimson dominated the inside, using Fagbenle’s stature and co-captain Miriam Rutzen’s tenacity to outscore the Terriers 34 to 12 in the paint. Fagbenle finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds while Rutzen was the only other Harvard player in double figures with 12.
“We had some great tag-team play, Temi and I, and a lot of our forwards came in to play big,” Rutzen said. “We’ll take that any night, and hopefully that’ll continue.”
With fifteen first-half points from the duo and four threes from other contributors, the Crimson earned a 31-27 halftime lead before going cold from deep in the second half.
“Obviously, it’s very frustrating to lose,” Rutzen said. “We felt we were the better team, and we feel we still are the better team and so it’s unfortunate to walk away with a loss.”
