After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2010-2011 school year has officially begun, and considering the significant changes implemented in recent years, students may be wondering what to expect from the College in the coming months. With the recession appearing to bottom out and recovery in near sight, we hope that University Hall views the re-expansion of programs put on hold by budget cuts to be a top priority.
In light of the recession’s impact on Harvard’s endowment, budget cuts beginning during the 2008-2009 school year were arguably unavoidable. Some such reductions, such as those targeting discretionary faculty spending, were appropriate and should be retained. Others, however—like the disappearance of hot breakfast in upperclass Houses—must be reconsidered due to the outpouring of student concern.
The indefinite postponement of the Allston Science Complex’s construction likewise merits reevaluation. If Harvard wishes to remain at the forefront of future research and innovation, it cannot hesitate to move forward, even in the close wake of economic adversity. Doing so is part of what it means to lead.
In addition to addressing some of the most strongly felt budget cuts, Harvard must also uphold its promise of expanded J-Term opportunities, since scanty offerings last year left much to be desired. The College has already begun to move in an expansionary direction elsewhere, what with the widely welcomed return of junior economics tutorials—although the lottery element remains less than ideal. Along similar lines, students would benefit from an increased number of teaching fellows, accompanied by a decrease in section sizes.
Change has already occurred outside the sphere of academic life, with the arrival of new House Masters in Cabot, Eliot, and Mather. The coming months should prove informative as the Harvard community gains a richer sense of what each new Master has to offer and in what ways they may come to redefine House life.
On the subject of new additions, Harvard’s decision to once again admit transfer students, after not doing so for two years, deserves high praise; we hope that the practice continues well into the future. The low number of accepted transfer students promises only incremental cost increases for the College, but these individuals and the diverse backgrounds they bring with them can only serve to augment the strength of the student body as a whole.
Mirroring evidence of expansion within the University, new businesses in the Square serve as a welcome sign of economic resurgence. The Harvard Community  Garden, which opened last spring, also provides a visual reminder of growth. In the year ahead, we trust that the College will make every effort to follow this trajectory, emerging from a difficult period with a renewed capacity to educate and care for its students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was jogging in New York City last week, the day after I got back from Africa, I instinctively waved to the other joggers passing me by and offered a friendly greeting. When I was met with downcast stares or ignored entirely, I picked up my speed and dejectedly ran away. I ran every day after I was done teaching at Eenhana Secondary School in Eenhana, Namibia, and there were many people in the village that I said “hi” to along my jog. Greetings weren’t just a wide-scale formality; they were genuine forms of reaching out to friends, neighbors, and strangers, and forgoing a greeting to someone you passed along the way was seen as rude and insulting.
While it was definitely nice to be back in America after two and a half months living and teaching in Africa, I had a hard time re-adjusting to the somewhat more detached social norms of the U.S., and I missed the pure and simple ties I formed with my host family and the daily rituals of greetings:
“Wa uhala po meme” How is the day, dear? (In Oshivambo, the dominant language of northern Namibia).
“Ehee” Good
“Nawa tu?” Really?
“Ehee” Yes, really!
The person who was asked the question would repeat the dialogue in reverse, then both would smile, wave, and continue on until the next person to be greeted came along. I learned this exchange in Oshivambo and earned countless smiles and many new Namibian friends this way. It is an instant icebreaker and helped me become integrated into my village. In contrast, it seems only during the first week of freshman year at Harvard is it truly socially acceptable to sit down in the dining hall at a table full of unfamiliar people and have a conversation.
Not only did I miss the friendly chatter of Namibians, but I also thought constantly about my host mom, the kids, and teachers at school.  I couldn’t believe how close I had become to these people so quickly. In just two months, my host mom accepted me as “forever a member of the Uuyumba family” and learners shared with me stories and secrets they had not told anyone before. Relationships were based solely on conversations you shared, genuinely listening to the other person’s needs and wants, and doing things for someone because you sincerely wanted to help—with no expectations or ulterior motives. I was invited to a wedding of a couple I had never met before, simply because they believed if there was a party, everyone should share in the celebration. There was no detectable social hierarchy, as everyone seemed to be included in all social gatherings. Distant cousins were supported by families, friends helped friends pay their bills without thinking of getting their money back, and the principal at my school housed two AIDS orphans in addition to her own children. When I asked my host mom why everyone was so willing to help friends and strangers, she responded “In Africa, we share. That’s how we survive.”
In America, relationships can be transient or formed to meet certain needs or goals.  Someone may help someone out with the expectation that this connection will offer rewards later on. It is sometimes hard to discern the true value of a relationship through texts, strategic Facebook posts, and fodder that sticks to one topic of conversation without really reaching depth.
Obviously, not every relationship formed is like this, and not every friendship is made with other intentions. However, the unspoken rules of social life in the states (and especially at Harvard) can sometimes make one question the reliability and sincerity of some relationships.
Though the value of networking and connections are not to be discounted,  perhaps we should also try a bit of the “African way” by greeting acquaintances and strangers, not just those in our inner circle. As the start of the new school year unfolds, we all have the opportunity to be “freshman” again. Hopefully I’ll have more luck on the streets of Cambridge and the dining halls of Harvard than in New York City. As they say in Eenhana, “kala po nawa.” Stay well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At colleges and universities across America, students are heading into the classroom, many for the first time. You’re taking part in a journey that will not only determine your future, but the future of this country. We know, for example, that nearly eight in 10 new jobs will require workforce training or higher education by the end of this decade. And we know that in a global economy, the nation that out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow. In the 21st century, America’s success depends on the education our students receive.
That’s why, soon after I took office, I proposed an ambitious goal: By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. And over the past year and a half, we’ve been putting in place policies to help us meet this goal.
First, we are making college more affordable. As students, you know why this matters. Over the past 10 years, college costs have shot up faster than housing, transportation and even health care costs. The amount student borrowers owe has risen almost 25 percent in just five years. This isn’t some abstract issue to me. Michelle and I had big loans to pay off when we graduated. I remember what that burden feels like. No one in America should be saddled with crushing debt simply because they sought an education. And no one should be denied a chance to make the most of their lives because they can’t afford it.
That’s why we fought so hard to win a battle that has been raging in Washington for years over how to administer student loans. Under the old system, taxpayers paid banks and financial companies billions of dollars in subsidies to act as middlemen—a deal that was very lucrative for them, but unnecessary and wasteful. And because these special interests were so powerful, this boondoggle survived for decades. But this year, we said enough is enough. As a result, instead of handing over $60 billion in unwarranted subsidies to big banks, we’re redirecting that money to upgrade America’s community colleges and make college more affordable for nearly 8 million students and families.
We’re tripling the investment in college tax credits for middle class families. We’re raising the value of Pell Grants, and we’ll make sure they increase each year to better keep up with inflation. We’re making loan repayments more manageable for more than one million more students. Future borrowers can even choose an income-based payment plan so that you don’t have to pay more than 10 percent of your salary each month. And if you go into public service, and keep up with your payments, your leftover student debt will be forgiven after 10 years. As part of this effort, we’re simplifying financial aid forms, too, by eliminating dozens of unnecessary questions.
I’d also point out: One way we’re helping young people afford college is by helping them to afford health insurance. Because of the new health care law, young adults can stay on their parents’ health plans until they are 26 years old.
Second, a college education needs to be more than affordable; it needs to prepare graduates for the jobs of the 21st century. Community colleges—undervalued assets in this country—are well-positioned to lead this effort. That’s why we’re upgrading these institutions by tying the skills taught in classrooms to the needs of local businesses in growing sectors of the economy.
The third part of our higher education strategy is making sure more students complete college. Over a third of America’s college students, and over half our minority students, don’t earn a degree, even after six years. That’s not just a waste of money; it’s an incredible waste of potential that holds our country back. We don’t just need to open the doors of college to more Americans; we need to ensure that students walk back out of those doors with a degree in their hands.
Of course, that depends on students. You are responsible for your own success. But there is more we can do to remove barriers to finishing college, especially for those earning a degree while working or raising a family. That’s why I’ve proposed a College Access and Completion Fund, to develop, implement and evaluate new approaches to improving college success and completion, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
So we are making college more affordable, gearing the education you receive to the demands of a global economy, and taking steps to lift graduation rates. Because this is how we’ll retake the lead in producing college graduates. This is how we’ll help students like you to fulfill your dreams. And this is how we’ll ensure that America prospers in this new century, and that we harness the greatest source of our strength: the talents of our people.

On Aug. 28, I found myself in Washington, D.C. on the date of Fox News host and self-described “rodeo clown” Glenn Beck’s “Restoring Honor” rally. Naturally, out of morbid curiosity, I decided to amble over to the Lincoln Memorial just to see what I would find. With all of the feigned outrage at Beck’s decision to host his rally on the 47th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, I was half-expecting to see a rabid mob of crazed neo-segregationists brandishing signs decrying President Obama’s plan for white slavery and lamenting how “the zoo has an African lion and the White House has a lyin’ African.” The reality, of course, was far more mundane.
Nevertheless, a wide cohort of liberal personalities has condemned the timing of Beck’s rally for its insensitivity, alleging that the occurrence of such an event on such an important day for African Americans was sacrilegious. The words of the reliably indignant Rev. Al Sharpton at his lightly-attended “Reclaim the Dream” counter-rally, for example, demonstrated as much. “This is our day, and we ain’t giving it away,” Sharpton blustered. “They want to disgrace this day.”
This notion, that the right to venerate King is exclusive to, one must assume, African Americans and likeminded liberals, is odious, far more odious than Glenn Beck’s desire to “reclaim the civil rights movement.” King is and ought to be an icon who transcends ideological divisions, and the execrable politicization of his legacy by the left must be repudiated.
Some have argued that Beck’s conservative politics rendered his presence at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial a perversion of King’s dream and cause. After all, as The Root’s Senior Biracial Correspondent David Swerlick points out, King supported organized labor and affirmative action, opposed the Vietnam War, and probably would have voted for President Obama. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, likewise, reminds us that “The full name of the event at which King spoke 47 years ago was the ‘March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom’” and that “Among its organizers was labor leader A. Philip Randolph, the founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and a vice president of the AFL-CIO.”
The idea that sharing King’s liberal ideology is a prerequisite to honoring him at the site of, and on the anniversary of, his speech is preposterous, for King’s political beliefs are quite irrelevant to why he is considered significant. King’s contribution to America was his championing of civil rights for ethnic minorities, not his less successful efforts to fight poverty and end the conflict in Vietnam. To claim that in order to honor King, one must honor his liberalism, is to minimize him in the same manner that conservatives have sought to minimize another great American, President Franklin Roosevelt, Class of 1904, by remembering him as nothing more than a liberal rather than the conductor of the American war effort against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Many Britons, one would expect, would balk if one were to suggest that only members of the Conservative Party and Tory sympathizers should be able to revere Winston Churchill or hold political events on the anniversary of “We Shall Fight Them on the Beaches.”
While civil rights may have been a liberal cause at the time and the preservation of segregation a conservative one, civil rights is now a matter of universal consensus. To pretend that the conservatives of today share the ideology, and thus the enmity with King, of the conservatives of yesterday is insulting and false. There is no reason why a liberal Beck-style rally would be any less perverse than a conservative one. In fact, we should be encouraged by the sight of hundreds of thousands of Southern white conservatives gathering to extol a man once seen as dangerous by many of their parents and grandparents.
Furthermore, while “Restoring Honor” was undeniably conservative in composition, it was hardly conservative in tenor. At Beck’s request, the event was free of any Tea Party signage or anti-Obama rhetoric. The president’s name was never mentioned, nor was any other politician’s. The event was exclusively devoted to celebrating America, God, and the troops, serving in part as a fundraiser for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. In fact, the bewildering ambiguity of the event was so pervasive that, in the words of radio host John Batchelor, it “is not about anything at all. It is a farce of an event.”
All of this having been said, this is no apologia for Beck’s other actions. There is no defense, in spite of a belated and suspect apology, for his labeling the president a “racist” with a “deep-seated hatred of white people.” Nor does this pardon Beck for harboring the sort of megalomaniacal delusions that would persuade him to host such an event as “Restoring Honor” in the first place. But no matter Beck’s other transgressions, he is no less entitled than Sharpton to hold a rally on that most significant of dates.

Harvard Business School admitted 12 percent of applicants to the school’s 2+2 Program this year—the lowest acceptance rate since the program’s inception three years ago. Yesterday afternoon, 100 seniors received e-mails notifying them of their admission to the 2015 cohort of the HBS 2 + 2 Program.
This year, 828 college juniors—a slight decrease from 844 last year—applied to the 2 + 2 Program, which requires accepted students to work for 2 years after graduation before entering Harvard Business School, according to Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid Deirdre C. Leopold. Last year, 115 students, or 14 percent, were admitted.
“This is a strong pool and not getting into 2 + 2 definitely does not mean that HBS is not in your future,” Leopold said of students who were not accepted to the program. “This is one vehicle, one moment in time.”
The 2 + 2 Program is designed to attract undergraduates with backgrounds that do not fit the traditional business school student profile, according to the program’s website. In the 2015 cohort, 60 percent of admitted students have engineering, hard sciences, or technical undergraduate majors, according to Leopold, up from 50 percent last year. Of the remaining admits, 6 percent are business undergraduate majors and 34 percent study humanities and social sciences.
“Directionally, that’s intentional,” Leopold said.
Next fall will be a seminal year for the program, as the first cohort admitted to 2 + 2 in the fall of 2008 enters Harvard Business School, Leopold said.
“This is a big year watching these 2013 be mainstreamed into the Class of 2013,” Leopold said. “It’ll be exciting.”
While Leopold said the program is not “designed for Harvard College,” around 20 Harvard students are represented in this year’s class.
Amelia H. Lin ’11, a physics concentrator admitted to the program, said she has been involved with start-ups for the past two summers and hopes to spend the next two years working at an early-stage start-up in Silicon Valley. As someone who comes from a non-traditional business background, she said she feels “an added measure of confidence” knowing she will have a formalized business learning experience after two years in the start-up world.
Although Sachin Gupta ’11, another admitted student concentrating in Applied Math, said he is unsure of his plans at the moment, he is confident Harvard Business School will prepare him to lead organizations in the future.
“Acceptance into 2+2 has afforded me a lot more freedom in considering my plans for the next few years,” he said.
Anna Marie Wagner ’11, an admitted student who switched into the Applied Math concentration from Molecular and Cellular Biology, said she is excited about the opportunity to explore more career paths in the next two years.
“Getting into 2+2 really allows you to pursue something you’re passionate about, as opposed to the more traditional options, such as finance or consulting,” Wagner said.

The loss of free Adobe software previously provided by Harvard for students to download on their personal computers has proven problematic for many student publications.
While a number of student publications normally conduct production on their staff members’ laptops, free Adobe software is now only available in the Science Center and the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Students hoping to use the software on their own laptops must now purchase the Adobe Creative Suite student edition from Harvard for $199. The Adobe Creative Suite, which is used for layout, image editing, and graphic design, includes popular programs like Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop.
The Harvard Independent previously designed its newspaper using Adobe products on personal computers in its SOCH office, said co-president S. Susan Zhu ’11.
This week, the staff attempted to produce the newspaper in the SOCH computer lab instead. Because that lab contains Macs and they usually use PCs, the fonts didn’t transfer and production lasted three hours longer than usual, according to Zhu.
“It was a nightmare trying to do all of it,” she said.
The publication solved the problem by eventually finding someone who already owned Adobe software and installing it on their computers.
Samuel J. Barr ’11, editor-in-chief of The Harvard Political Review, also said he was worried about font compatibility on Harvard-owned computers.
The political magazine uses both InDesign and Photoshop, and Barr said that The HPR would likely relocate to a facility that hosts the software as a result of the change.
“It’s definitely inconvenient to have to do the whole thing there rather than on our laptops,” he said.
Meghan F. Houser ’11, editorial board president of Tuesday Magazine, agreed that gathering the entire staff at the computer lab for production would be an inconvenience. But due to a limited budget, the magazine will be unable to purchase the Adobe Creative Suite and will likely be forced to use one of Harvard’s computer labs with Adobe access.
“There’s no way Tuesday can afford that,” Houser said of purchasing Adobe software.
But the Adobe policy change will not affect all publications.
Satire V editor-in-chief Amy Rosenthal ’11 said the humor publication does not use Adobe products for production. The Crimson operates its own licenses for Adobe software, according to Crimson Design Co-Chair Emma M. Benintende ’11, but many editors used to have the Harvard-provided version of the software installed on their own personal computers.
As of press time, Noah S. Selsby ’95, senior client technology adviser for Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology, did not return  a request for comment.

Teenagers—especially girls—who regularly sleep less than eight hours a night tend to eat more fatty and sugary foods than those who maintain adequate sleep schedules, according to a study published in yesterday’s issue of the journal Sleep.
The study, headed by Susan Redline, a professor of medicine at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, attempted to connect findings about decreased sleep and increased obesity rates among teenagers.
“The message really is that adequate good sleep is really important for good health, and poor sleep is definitely contributing to the obesity epidemic our population is witnessing,” Redline said.
Redline added that she hopes these findings will draw attention to the importance of good sleep alongside healthy diet and exercise.
The study followed 240 adolescents between 16 and 19 in the Cleveland area, tracking their sleep durations and self-reported food intake.
After adjusting for potential confounders such as weight, gender, obesity, and race, the researchers found that teenagers who slept less than eight hours a night consumed on average 2.2 percent more fats.
For each hour of decrease in sleep, there was a 0.8 percent increase in consumption of fatty and sugary foods.
This correlation is consistent with previous research, said Frank B. Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Previous studies have shown that sleep deprivation affects appetite-regulating hormones, specifically by decreasing leptin, an appetite suppressor that causes the feeling of fullness, and increasing ghrelin, a stomach hormone that stimulates the appetite.
“When people are hungry, they crave high energy density foods high in fats and sugars,” said Hu. “The amounts of fat and sugar in our diets are already very high, and when hormonal changes induce hunger, it’s not surprising that kids will reach for such types of foods.”
Apart from hormonal changes, which Redline said was currently the strongest hypothesis, other potential explanations are that shorter sleepers have more opportunities to eat simply because they are awake longer, or that the adolescents are eating as a stress response to sleep deprivation.
Redline said that this link may explain the “freshman 15” phenomenon many college students experience.
College surveys have shown that some freshman get less than five hours of sleep at night, a result of living in an environment in which they go to sleep very late but still get up early for class, said Redline.
“In response to the stress of sleep deprivation and exams, many students turn to late-night snacking or junk foods,” she said.

The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has created five new administrative positions—termed “area deans”—to oversee subfields within engineering and applied physics.
These five deans join the two existing deans in applied mathematics and computer science. According to SEAS Director of Communications Michael P. Rutter, the seven deans will essentially serve as a “steering committee” to advise SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray.
Rutter said that Murray has been interested in expanding the area deanships since she first took the reins at SEAS in 2009.
Many of the newly created deans plan to explore the expansion of existing engineering tracks into independent concentrations or secondary fields, according to Rutter.
These proposals are in line with Murray’s stated desire to create distinct majors out of different engineering fields, such as mechanical and electrical engineering, which are currently part of the broader “engineering sciences” concentration.
This process of encouraging finer distinctions began last spring with the creation of the new Biomedical Engineering concentration, which will be offered for the first time this fall.
“The idea is to learn what makes sense for each of these curricular fields: A full major? A minor?” Rutter said. “They’re going to see what works for each individual area.”
Area Dean of Applied Mathematics Michael P. Brenner said that he saw “developing classes and the curriculum” as his “major role.”
“The thing about SEAS is that there aren’t any departments, so the notion of the area deans is to recruit faculty from all different fields to help out in their area,” he said. “These should lead to more organization, and, in the longer term, it will lead to a stronger undergraduate program...something that’s more intellectually coherent and better for students.”
Rutter said that all of the area deans will also focus on improving their curricula, building community among students, and guiding junior faculty.
Area Dean for Environmental Science and Engineering Steve C. Wofsy agreed, saying he was looking to develop a strong curriculum, foster linkages with the Earth and Planetary Sciences and Environmental Science and Public Policy concentrations, and support faculty members in their research and instruction.
“I’m here to help build community and to help faculty out with the bureaucracy,” Wofsy said. “SEAS is too big not to have these [positions].”

Last-minute news that Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren will not be teaching “Contracts” this fall is fueling speculation that the consumer rights advocate will be tapped to head the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
Because Warren continued to teach while actively working in Washington on financial regulatory reform in 2008 and 2009, the announcement sparked rumors in the media yesterday over whether the change indicates that she will lead the newly created federal financial watchdog group.
But Warren’s decision not to teach “Contracts” does not free her from all her teaching responsibilities. Warren is still scheduled to teach a seminar with Professor Lynn M. LoPucki entitled “Empirical Analysis of Law,” Law School spokesperson Robb London confirmed.
LoPucki said that students have enrolled in the seminar and that the class will meet next Tuesday.
“We all know that she’s up for a possible appointment,” LoPucki said. “I don’t know what the timing of an appointment is or if that would be a problem. Until there’s been an appointment, there’s nothing to deal with.”
LoPucki declined to comment on whether he had spoken with Warren regarding a potential appointment or if they had made contingency plans in the event she receives the position.
The Washington Post first reported that Warren would not be teaching “Contracts” after obtaining an e-mail from Law School Dean Martha L. Minow addressed to students in the course.
In that e-mail, Minow informed first year students in Warren’s section that she would be replaced by Gerald E. Frug, a veteran of the faculty.
“Professor Warren regrets that she will not be able to teach you this fall and we regret the last minute change, but I know you will have a wonderful semester with Professor Frug and your other Section 3 teachers,” Minow wrote to students Tuesday.
Warren’s students said they were not surprised to learn that she would not be teaching the course.
Since the start of the school year, rumors that Warren would scale back on classroom time had been swirling amid speculation that she could be named the head of the watchdog agency.
“I had seen her on The Daily Show a couple of times, and I really liked her and had heard good things about her in the classroom,” said Christian E. Pilhofer, a first year student who had been slated to take Warren’s contracts course.
Warren rose to prominence last year as a strong advocate for increased consumer protection in the market for financial products and as the chairwoman of the congressional panel that oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the politically unpopular fund that supported banks during the worst of the financial crisis.
After multiple appearances before panels and on television, Warren became a symbol for tough regulation of financial services.
Through her advocacy, she became a popular choice to lead the newly-minted Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, gaining the backing of the prominent Massachusetts House Democrat Barney Frank ’62, among other legislators.
“It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote as the housing bubble was reaching its peak. “But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.”
Warren, through a spokesperson, declined to comment for this article.

The University’s Committee on African Studies earned $2.5 million dollars and gained national recognition when the Department of Education designated the area of study as a National Resource Center in July.
This designation is the “holy grail” of area study grants, according to Caroline Elkins, history professor and chair of the Standing Committees on African and Ethnic Studies.
The designation and its accompanying Title 6 grant were allotted to 10 universities around the country for a four-year term, recognizing those universities’ engagement with African studies.
With the new funds, Harvard’s committee will expand its study abroad offerings, revamp courses, and expand its language offerings, according to Elkins.
For nearly a decade, the University has been expanding its course offerings in African studies; it now offers 300 courses pertaining to Africa and instruction in 31 African languages, making its program the most extensive in the country, according to Elkins.
When the University first began to expand its course offerings, it “got letters from embassies in Washington D.C. who were thrilled that Harvard was teaching languages that back in Africa had been deprivileged by English and French,” History Professor and Professor of African and African American Studies Emmanuel Akyeampong said.
African immigration to the Boston area has been on the upswing over the past two decades, he added, and the University has made efforts to incorporate these growing communities into its coursework through a social engagement program. Students travel to communities near campus and practice the African language they are studying with native speakers “before even going to Africa,” according to Akyeampong.
“The National Resource Center and the Title 6 will enable us to step up and scale up these things in ways that become more nationally visible,” he said.
While Elkins said the grant application, due in March, was the culmination of nine months of data-gathering by individuals throughout the University, Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., the director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies, described Elkins as “the mastermind who got this whole thing working.”
The University applied unsuccessfully for the designation in 2006, Elkins said.
The grants have their origin in American foreign policy interests, according to Akyeampong. After World War II, Africa “was becoming independent...and the United States needed to learn very quickly about this huge country and what was happening there,” he said. “And one way they did that was promoting African studies in American universities.”
“We are already have the best African language program in the world,” Elkins said, “and it is only going to get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first Institute of Politics forum of the semester—“Ask What You Can Do: Inspiring Public Service”—began with a somewhat somber address from Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75.
Referring to the economic crisis, the BP oil spill, and Hurricane Earl, Ellwood called the present period “a terrifying time.”
But Ellwood said he saw hope in the work of the Kennedy School and its students.
“We really do need great leaders,” he said.
The panel brought together four Kennedy School alumni who worked in various areas of public service, though with different political bents: Patricia Clarey, former chief of staff to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; Chilean Ambassador to the United States Arturo Fermandois; US Army Deputy Director for Strategic Planning and Policy Brigadier General Charles W. Hooper; and Political Analyst Jamal Simmons.
While the panelists came from different sides of the aisle and various parts of the globe, they all agreed that public service is more rewarding than working in the private sector.
Describing an incident in which he had worked with NASA and the state of Pennsylvania to help save a group of miners trapped in a mine in Chile, Fermandois recalled the feeling of working toward a common goal in public service.
“That’s something that, in my case, for the first time you feel something that you don’t get in the private sector, which is belonging to a large team,” Fermandois said.
Hooper admitted that the most frustrating part of his job is dealing with rivalries among politicians, which he said detracts from the common goal of bettering society, but added that the Kennedy School taught him to move past petty rivalries.
“The reason the republic works so well is that at some point we move past that in a civil fashion, and we sit down, and we talk, and we work it out,” Hooper said.
Kennedy School students said they enjoyed the event, noting that a reminder of the importance of public service as a vocation was a good way to start the semester.
“I think I appreciated that the panel highlighted the commonalties that exist between all people who work in public service, regardless of political, religious, social, and economic leanings,” said Tyler S. Thigpen. “It’s just a desire to help people. It encourages my spirit, and it made me proud to be associated with them.

Fashionistas will now be able to financially support up and coming designers long before their latest collections hit the stores thanks to FashionStake, a website launched by two Harvard Business School students on Wednesday.
The online marketplace, created by Vivian Y. Weng and Daniel S. Gulati, helps designers raise funds needed to produce their collections by allowing customers to invest directly in a designer or pre-order items at a 40 percent discount.
These purchases or contributions go toward the designer’s funding target, and if the target is met, these customers will receive special promotions for the designer’s collection.
In this way, “consumers can actually determine what styles and collections get produced,” said Weng, characterizing the process as a way to “democratize” fashion.
Unlike the traditional fashion distribution process, FashionStake allows customers to give designers feedback on their pieces before they are produced in quantity, Weng noted.
“We’re very excited to be ushering in a new way of introducing fashion to the marketplace,” she said.
According to Weng, designers were also “extremely excited” about the idea.
Nicholas K, one of the four designers currently featured on FashionStake, plans to extend personal invitations to its New York Fashion Week runway show at Lincoln Center to six of its FashionStake supporters, according to a press release.
Charles A. LaCalle ’11, who also started a fashion company, said that FashionStake could be a boon to some designers.
“If FashionStake works out, it will solve a huge problem for some designers. After working in luxury consulting, I’ve realized that securing funding to produce collections is one of the major problems in the fashion industry”, he said.
However, according to LaCalle, FashionStake may find it difficult to overcome consumer psychology.
“People [consumers] don’t want to buy clothes in the future. They want it now,” LaCalle said.

The legal saga involving Boston University graduate student Joel Tenenbaum’s illegal file-sharing continued late last month after his legal team—led by Law School Professor Charles R. Nesson—filed a notice that they would further appeal the fine levied against him.
Tenenbaum’s legal team won a victory earlier this summer when U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Gertner slashed Tenenbaum’s fine, but the appeal aims to further reduce that penalty.
Tenenbaum had originally been ordered to pay $675,000 to the Recording Industry Association of America for sharing 30 songs, but Gertner said in a ruling that the fine had been excessive and reduced the penalty to $67,500, or $2,250 per song.
“It definitely is a victory to get a fine reduced by 90 percent. However, it’s still ridiculous to be charged over $2,000 a song when the songs cost 99 cents on iTunes,” Tenenbaum said.
The RIAA, which filed the original suit against Tenenbaum, has also filed notice that it plans to appeal the ruling.
“We had no choice but to appeal the erroneous and unprecedented decision by the district court,” RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth said in a statement. “The ruling casts aside a jury verdict squarely within the range established by Congress and clearly supported by the undisputed harm to the recording industry and the egregiousness of the defendant’s conduct.”
The legal proceedings between Tenenbaum and the RIAA have become a symbolic battle between advocates for free flows of information—including the copyrighted variety—and content providers whose profit margins are threatened by file-sharing programs.
“It still comes down to that the songs at most cost the recording industry $21,” Nesson said. “Sixty-seven thousand dollars against a noncommercial kid who didn’t make a profit and didn’t intend to make a profit is still insanity.”
Tenenbaum is not the first file-sharer to be targeted by the RIAA, but by enlisting Nesson, who has mounted a spirited and at times controversial defense, he has made his fight in court an important battleground for the future of copyright law.
The two parties have been engaged in a protracted and colorful legal fight that has included Nesson being reprimanded by the judge and the RIAA seeking an injunction against Tenenbaum for allegedly promoting a file posted on a Swedish file-sharing  service that contained the 30 songs mentioned in the case and was titled “The $675,000 Mixtape.”

Harvard Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser will remain in charge of his laboratory in William James Hall under “supervision established by the Dean of the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences],” a University official said yesterday.
Hauser confirmed yesterday that he will run his lab while on leave after an internal University investigation found him “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct.
The lab is running experiments on the psychology of dogs, moral judgments in adults, and economic decision making in children, Hauser wrote in an e-mail.
Hauser has been in “constant contact with” his graduate students, said Gordon T. Kraft-Todd ’07, one of his research assistants, adding that Hauser visited his lab this summer from Cape Cod, where he has been working on an upcoming book.
FAS spokesman Jeff Neal declined to elaborate on the nature of the supervision, stating only that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith had imposed the additional oversight.
Neal added that graduate and post-doctoral students were given the option of switching advisers or continuing their research under Hauser “in order to avoid potential disruption to their careers.”
After a three-year investigation found evidence of scientific misconduct in Hauser’s lab, Smith wrote in a letter to the Faculty Aug. 20 that the “appropriate sanctions” Hauser faces could include “involuntary leave, the imposition of additional oversight on a faculty member’s research lab, and appropriately severe restrictions on a faculty member’s ability to apply for research grants, to admit graduate students, and to supervise undergraduate research.”
Hauser is currently facing federal inquiries, as some of his research was supported by federal funds.
Some psychology professors were sympathetic to Harvard’s decision to allow Hauser to continue to work in the lab.
“It’s a tricky balance between taking preemptive actions that aren’t justified later and letting something go too long,” said Robert A. Bjork, a psychology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Harvard has a long history, so I imagine they’re trying to find what precedents exist, if there are any.”
Meanwhile, University of Washington Psychology Professor Michael D. Beecher said “people should be patient and let this thing play out and not rush to judgment on Marc.”
“I’m not sure to what extent the problem is Marc was fast and sloppy—and I don’t think he will be anymore,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From facing long lines for hot food in Annenberg to calling home for instructions on how to do laundry, the freshman class of 2014 has quickly learned that the awkward introductions and silly questions are just a part of settling in.
Although each freshman may handle the transition to college life differently, their learning experiences mirror those of Harvard classes from throughout the years.
YOU HAD ME AT HELLO
In a freshman class of just over 1600, the adjustment process began with meeting new classmates. Or at least trying to.
“I think that there’s a mutual understanding between all freshmen that forgetting someone’s name is completely forgivable,” said Margaret W. Fulham ’14, a resident of Mower. “After you meet them again, you’ll remember their name, so it’s not a big deal. Nobody gets upset if you forget their name.”
Godwin O. Abiola ’14, whose entire high school in North Carolina was only 1200 students, was amazed at the Harvard’s diversity
“There’s a whole bunch of schools that are diverse—here it goes beyond those that flaunt that they are diverse,” Abiola said. “When schools flaunt that they’re diverse, they mean racially diverse. Here, it’s diverse experiences.”
A ROOM OF ONE’S OWN
For some freshman, the excitement of moving into a new dorm was tempered by the dorm’s distance from Harvard Yard itself.
Justin To ’14 said that he was initially unhappy to find out how far his assigned dorm Greenough was from the freshman dining hall.
“At first, I was disappointed because I heard nightmare stories about the walk to Annenberg,” To said, “but it’s not that bad.”
But To said that he was not particularly fond of the dining hall food anyway.
“The food in Harvard Square compensates for it,” To said.
THE FIRST LOAD
Other freshmen were struggling with washing their first load of laundry—without the help of parents.
Back at her dorm in Straus, Droege found herself helping out several male classmates in her entryway with their first loads of laundry.
“I don’t think any of them had ever done laundry in their life,” Wren R. Droege ’14 said. “‘Can I put my socks in the washer?’ ‘Where does the detergent go?’” she recalled them asking.
Mateus C. Falci ’14, however, said he was not afraid to admit that he needed to call his mother in order to determine what items of clothing he could and could not put in a dryer.
THE PERFECT STORM
For some newcomers, it was the weather in the last week that proved most challenging.
“I’m from California. I’m not used to the humidity at all,” To said. “This is the first time I’ve been drenched in sweat.”
“Apparently, I brought Florida weather up with me,” Falci said. “Not only is it hot and humid, but there’s also a hurricane coming.”
Despite the new difficulties of college life, some freshmen are still finding little gems of encouragement to pull them through their first weeks.
To, for instance, found a housewarming gift from his mother in the mail—Ritz crackers, a favorite snack.
“My mom mailed me Ritz crackers because she was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to get them here.”
For other freshmen, simply the knowledge that they were here on campus as college students was a welcoming feeling.
“At some point during convocation, I think I got chills,” Falci said. “I realized how fortunate I am to have this opportunity to be here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students lined the stairs and poured out of the double doors of Science Center Hall C yesterday afternoon, as Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics Professor Michael P. Brenner debuted the new course Science of the Physical Universe 27, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter.”
According to School of Engineering and Applied Sciences postdoctoral fellow Otger Campás-Rigau—one of the class’s three other instructors—the student audience numbered around 600, far exceeding the 350-person capacity of the lecture hall.
The course, which will explore the physical and chemical properties of matter through the lens of cooking science, will incorporate cooking and eating into lab sections. Weekly lectures will feature prominent chefs and food experts in the field of “molecular gastronomy”­—a discipline that uses science to re-engineer food.
For example, guest lecturer Wylie Dufresne is known for creating noodles made almost entirely of shrimp.
“This is an extraordinary opportunity to teach science,” Brenner said. “We hope that students will be able to understand the science and learn to see it in the things that they cook.”
Brenner said attendance may bloat even further next Tuesday, when world-renowned chefs Ferran Adrià and José Andés will be joined by food critic Harold McGee as guest lecturers.
“We’ve been changing our expectations—we started out thinking 200 or 300, but as we got closer to today, we started thinking somewhere around 600,” said teaching fellow Emily R. Russell, a third-year physics Ph.D. student.
According to Campás-Rigau, the class will be lotteried down to 300 students by next Wednesday, a significantly larger class size than the 190-student cap discussed last spring. Despite the high level of student interest, Campás-Rigau said the class size could not be increased because of constraints on the number of possible sections.
“It is simply that we don’t have any more space in the labs,” he said.
The lottery will not take seniority into account.
Students who shopped the class said they were drawn by the opportunity to learn from celebrity chefs while fulfilling a science requirement for the Core or General Education.
“It will be different for me [to take a lab class], and I’m not looking forward to it,” said Charlotte H. Nicholas ’13, who plans to concentrate in English. “That’s why I’m hoping to do cooking instead.”
Students also said that the class had generated a significant buzz since it was announced last spring.
“It’s one of those classes that everyone has been talking about since the end of last year,” said Tessa M. Kaplan ’13, who also shopped the course. “I think it goes without saying that something about food and something that involves lab sections where you’re cooking and getting to eat your experiments is pretty cool.”
While both Nicholas and Kaplan were able to grab seats, students in the entrance of the hall periodically jumped up to catch a glance at Brenner and cupped their ears to hear him. Those unable to make it into the classroom are not entirely out of luck, as the course was recorded and will be available on the course website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, the 2010-11 Harvard men’s soccer team has a very different look than its predecessor, which won an Ivy League title and reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament last fall.
This change starts at the top, where head coach Jamie Clark is gone, replaced by Carl Junot.  After the 2009 NSCAA Northeast Region Coach of the Year resigned in June, the Harvard athletics department embarked on a nationwide search before deciding on Junot, a Crimson assistant from 2008-10 who served as the head coach at Tufts for just three months before returning to Harvard.
“[Coach Junot] took the best qualities of Jamie and brought them along with his own influence on the game,” goalie Austin Harms said. “I think he’s doing a great job.”
Also gone are the team’s top goal-scorer and its best defender. Hermann Trophy finalist and first-team All-American Andre Akpan ’10, the school’s all-time leading scorer, has moved on to the Colorado Rapids of the MLS, while Kwaku Nyamekye ’10, another All-Ivy first-teamer, was drafted by the Columbus Crew. Akpan, Nyamekye, and their fellow departing seniors will be replaced on the roster by seven incoming freshmen, a class ranked 21st in the country by College Soccer News.
“I think everyone’s going to have to step up and take a little bit more of a leadership role,” sophomore forward Brian Rogers said.
Despite these differences, the high expectations surrounding the team remain the same. After reaching as high as No. 6 in the national rankings in 2009, Harvard enters the season ranked 10th in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America poll as it looks to reach the NCAA tournament for a fifth consecutive season.
But Junot doesn’t feel the high ranking puts an extra burden on the team to succeed.
“The message we send to our players is you’re more than likely going to get the results you want if you enjoy the game,” he said. “As much as possible we try to remove pressure from the equation and create an experience where our players really enjoy being on the field.”
Despite the emphasis on enjoyment, there will certainly be a greater need for the team’s returning players to step up and fill the shoes of Akpan, Adam Rousmaniere ’10, and Desmond Mitchell ’10, who together accounted for half of the team’s scoring last season.
Part of that burden falls on Rogers, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, who finished second on the team in points (18) and goals (6) last season.
“I think definitely there’s a pressure on me to score goals,” Rogers said. “But I don’t think that pressure falls solely on me...as a whole this year I think we’re going to be a more balanced team.”
Junot also doesn’t see the need for one player to carry the team again.
“Obviously Andre scored a lot of goals here, but I’m a firm believer that goal production is largely based on a team’s ability to find opportunities for players like Andre,” the coach said. “And I feel like we’ve increased our ability to create goal-scoring opportunities with the players that we have.”
Junot is also looking for solid production from his seven-member freshman class that features midfielder Kyle Henderson, an NSCAA/Adidas High School All-American and defender Ross Friedman, who was NSCAA all-region as a senior in Ohio.
“They’re very talented, and I expect them to come in, compete for playing time, and to push others on the team,” Junot said of his rookies.
Senior forward/midfielder Alex Chi, junior midfielder Jamie Rees, and sophomore midfielder Scott Prozeller, all of whom had four points last year, will also be expected to contribute more heavily on the offensive end this season.
Defensively, the team is steadied by its two senior captains, defensemen Jaren LaGreca and Robert Millock. Richard Smith, who started 10 games for the Crimson and was named to the All-Ivy League Second Team as a freshman, will be looking for continued success in his second year.
Behind them, Harms returns in net after a sophomore season in which he finished second in the Ancient Eight in save percentage at .803 and first in shutouts with seven.
“Obviously Austin’s gained a lot of experience being a two-year starter as an underclassman here,” Junot said. “My expectation is that Austin again makes significant gains as a goalkeeper in terms of his ability to read the game, organize the defense, and lead the defense as well.”
Harms will have to really raise his performance if he is going to duplicate last year’s numbers, as Harvard’s schedule features games against No. 8 UC Santa Barbara, No. 12 Boston College, No. 13 Stanford, and No. 22 Connecticut before beginning Ivy League play.
“The reality is our playing schedule is among the very best in the country,” Junot said.
But Harvard’s players believe that last season’s run prepared them well for the high expectations that come with this season.
“I think the experience in big games and against those big teams as kind of an underdog gave me and a lot of the other guys last year confidence with them,” Rogers said.
And this confidence has the Crimson thinking big for the whole season.
“We expect to win the Ivy League, or at least be in contention for the Ivy League, and to definitely make the NCAAs again,” Rogers said. “We’re all really confident going into the season. We’re a much different team than we were last year—we lost some important guys, but we think as a team we’ve grown, and I think we should do even better than we did last year.”
Harvard will have its first chance to prove itself tomorrow night, when the Crimson opens the season against the 13th-ranked Cardinal at home.

The Harvard Carnival has been postponed because of the threat of “severe weather,” according to the Office of Student Life.
The College Events Board is tasked with rescheduling the event.
“The CEB is working on the details related to rescheduling the event and will make a formal announcement by early next week at the latest,” Assistant Dean David R. Friedrich wrote in an e-mail.
The annual event, now in its fifth year, has usually featured festive food, huge crowds of milling people, and sometimes, even tire swings.

Hurricane Earl is expected to  arrive in the Boston area around 2pm today, bringing a welcome drop in  temperature and a less welcome deluge of rain, plus some potentially  nasty wind. But have no fear! Even if you're already sequestered in your  House basement, we're here to bring you up-to-the minute information  on the storm.
11:05 a.m. Earl appears to have passed us by. Radar shows some lingering clouds to  the south and west of Boston, but the forecast is for clear skies all  day today. A final song for the Hurricane playlist:
The Dixie Chicks- Goodbye Earl
8:06 p.m. Observing the storm (or rather, what hasn't really materialized into a storm) from one of the highest points on campus, the 17th floor of Mather tower, we noted increased visibility. Individual cars crossing the MIT bridge are clearly visible.
7:55 p.m. Satellite photos show that the bulk of Hurricane Earl is located off the coast of Connecticut and Cape Cod.
7:27 p.m. If, like us, you are not entirely sure how serious a threat Earl poses  (because yes, hurricanes can be pretty terrifying), you may find the  following facts relevant:
1. The storm is now a Category 1 Hurricane (down from the more intense Category 2).
2. Satellite photos show that the bulk of Hurricane Earl is currently  located just south of Cape Cod, along the New Jersey and Connecticut  coasts (Take that, Jersey Shore!)
3. The National Weather Service does not have a tropical storm alert for Middlesex County, but a flash flood watch is in place for central and southeast Middlesex County.
4. Planes in and out of Logan are currently listed as being delayed by  30 to 40 minutes, which is basically nothing compared to Thanksgiving.
4:55 p.m. Rain started and stopped, but will likely start again. There are still  plenty of ominous clouds to the west, over Boston. Humidity has  climbed to 89 percent. Blah.
3:00 p.m. Though the sky is darkening and the humidity is steadily climbing (now up to 73 percent, according to Weather Underground),  Earl is running late for his 2 p.m. appointment with Cambridge. Some  students are using the extra time to prepare hurricane inspired parties  (Hurricanes, for those over 21). They're also making playlists inspired by the incoming inclement weather.
Here's one such compilation from Mather Open:
Scorpions - Rock you Like a Hurricane
Bob Dylan - Hurricane
Bob Dylan - Shelter from The Storm
REO Speedwagon - Ridin' the Storm Out 
Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter
Creedence Clearwater Revival - Who'll Stop the Rain
The Beatles - Rain
The Temptations - I Wish It Would Rain
The Doors- Riders on the Storm 
 Rihanna - Umbrella
James Taylor- Fire and Rain
Clint Black - Like the Rain
Keith Urban - Raining on Sunday
Luke Bryan - Rain is a Good Thing
Fat Joe - Make it Rain
Live - Lightning Crashes
Weather Girls - It's Raining Men
12:53 p.m. Weather Underground reports a temperature of 84 degrees in Cambridge, with humidity  hovering around 60 percent. It's a bit cloudy, but students are still milling  about as usual, and the threat of "hurricane force winds" has not stopped  the tourists determined to rub John Harvard's foot.

Looking for a fun and not-too-taxing course to fill the final spot on your study card? We searched the Q guide, looking for ten easy classes. Now you don’t even have to go to the trouble of finding your hassle-free class. Enjoy!
Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 33: Ancient Fictions: The Ancient Novel in Context Reading a work written in ancient times by a guy named Apuleius doesn’t sound like a walk in the park — until you learn that the book’s title is the Golden Ass.  Students gave this Gen Ed class rave reviews, and 48 percent claimed it was easy as well as enjoyable.
Anthropology 1010: The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods and Reasoning — This is Harvard’s introductory archaeology class, and the reviews say that it’s a painless way to try out a neat subject. Over 50 percent of participants claimed the class was “easy” or “very easy.”
 
Culture and Belief 16: Performance, Tradition and Cultural Studies: An Introduction to Folklore and Mythology — This class is required of all Folk & Myth concentrators and also fills that pesky Culture and Belief Gen Ed. Participants say that studying stories isn’t too difficult – in fact, 11 percent say it’s “very easy,” and another 45% deem it “easy.”
Drama 101: Introduction to Theater — The “101” practically says it all, and the low difficulty reported in the Q guide says the rest. This class sounds like lots of fun; students have the opportunity to attend professional shows in Cambridge and Boston and interact with theater professionals.
Engineering Sciences 139: Innovation in Science and Engineering — Students learn about engineering and problem solving from leaders in art, business, and science.  Background in science is not required; 17 percent call this class “very easy,” and 53 percent say it’s “easy.”
Neurobiology 95hfj: The Sleeping Brain — Enrollment in this class is limited, and students are required to have completed an introductory life science course and MCB 80 before signing up.  But making the cut seems to be the hardest part. Out of the 10 students last year, seven reported that the class was a breeze.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 59: Plants and Human Affairs — Though this class requires that students complete one introductory OEB course before enrolling, it garnered a workload ranking of 1.08 on a scale of 1 to 5.  It’s nearly impossible to find a better rating.  Along with the exceptionally light homework, the class was ranked “very easy” by 31 percent of enrollees and “easy” by another 31 percent.
Portuguese Ac: Beginning Portuguese for Spanish Speakers – If you happen to already know Spanish, this is the quickest route to picking up another language. Of the 52 evaluators of this special course, 21 percent said that learning Portuguese was “very easy” and 37 percent said it was “easy.”
Psychology 950: Psychology Live! – Who can resist a course with a title ending in an exclamation mark? Various faculty lecture each week, letting students sample the best that the psychology department has to offer. Last year, 17 percent of the students said that this highlights reel was “very easy,” and 43 percent called it “easy.”
Swedish A: Beginning Swedish Language and Literature – Languages at Harvard aren’t a piece of cake, but the Q guide says this is one of the more manageable ones.  The workload is rated 2 out of 5, lower than most introductory language courses, and you certainly get personalized instruction. There were just three students in last year’s class, and two deemed it to be “easy.”  All three said they recommend the class with enthusiasm.

Recently, we reported on LaundryView—a new web-based system for checking the availability of laundry machines online. The change was accompanied by an increase in the price. We asked students what they think about the changes.
Ivan D. Bochkov ’12 – Kirkland House
I probably won’t use it […] and I don’t think it’s a foolproof timesaver. For instance, you could check online, identify an open machine, and then carry your laundry downstairs only to discover that someone has put their laundry in that machine in the five or ten minutes it took you to collect your laundry, detergent, etc. and make it to the laundry room.
Anna J. Murphy '12 - Quincy House
I’d like to say, being a person who does laundry maybe four times a semester, I'm not that concerned. We get by.
Esther S. Wu ’13 – Winthrop House (currently living in DeWolfe)
I don’t think [LaundryView] is worth an extra 25 cents per load of laundry. I probably wouldn’t use it, and those quarters add up. If you do laundry every other week, those quarters can add up to a couple extra dollars per year, and I’d rather spend that on BerryLine.
H. Louise Hindal '12 - Quincy House
 
I think it's a cool system. I'm impressed by the technology behind it. But 25 cents is a lot per load in terms of scale. But I don't know enough about it, and I'm pretty ambivalent about it.
Wendy Y.X. Chen ‘12 – Cabot House
I don’t know if [LaundryView] will really matter too much in Cabot because most of the machines aren’t usually in use; it’s probably not worth the extra quarter per load.
Jon C. Wise ’11 – Leverett House
You would have to be really lazy to bother looking up whether or not laundry machines are in use on your computer. It doesn’t seem justified with the price increase, but it could be justified without it. Having said that, I may use [LaundryView] occasionally to save a couple minutes, but I wish we could have had a heads-up on this—or a chance to vote it down.
Ruthe J. Foushee '12 - Quincy House
I just have piles in order of stench. I lift it up and smell it. I don't know why we're paying more. Maybe they're hiring little elves to watch the machines.
