After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 29, I woke up to a flurry of messages from students, alumni, and journalists regarding a new piece published by The Crimson’s Editorial Board declaring it was “proud to finally lend our support to both Palestinian liberation and [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]” and now would “call on everyone to do the same.”
As both president of Harvard Hillel and Associate News Editor for The Crimson, many of the questions I received pertained to my dual affiliation with these two organizations, now seemingly at odds with one another.
I have worked for The Crimson since freshman year, and it has been an integral part of my time at Harvard — some nights I am there until 2 or 3 a.m. as an executive, after four semesters of reporting.
But integral as The Crimson has been, I am first and foremost a Jew; and in light of the role Israel plays in my people’s history as our homeland and haven from persecution, I am a Zionist, and I stand with Israel.
People have asked me whether I plan on quitting, whether I could have prevented this, and who is to blame. I have no intention of quitting; I understand this piece does not reflect the views of other boards, or even the views of some members of the Editorial Board who may not have been at the meeting.
We live in a country where peaceful protest is strongly encouraged. But the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement — overwhelmingly condemned by Congress in a 2019 resolution passed 398-17 — is not just a boycott; BDS rejects Jewish self-determination altogether.
If you doubt me, ask its founders: “Definitely, most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine,” said co-founder Omar Barghouti, who also declared that Palestinians have a right to “resistance by any means, including armed resistance.”
Perhaps the Editorial Board would agree, since its piece fails to condemn Palestinian terrorism or the charter of Hamas — the governing regime elected to power in Gaza in 2006 — that explicitly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish people. On top of that, a 2019 New York Times article reported that the BDS National Committee lists among its members the Council of National and Islamic Forces in Palestine, which in turn includes both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
How many members of the Editorial Board can tell me the story of Israel’s history — numerous peace treaties the Palestinians have rejected, human shields used by Hamas to gaslight Israel, and thousands of Israeli civilians murdered by terrorists? What about the millions of dollars used by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for the “Pay to Slay” Program, rewarding terrorists for crimes against Israelis?
Israel is not perfect, nor is any other country. But this editorial is part of a larger trend of singling out Jews, conveniently neglecting our half of the story — and by extension our right to self-determination — while claiming to “oppose antisemitism.”
Judaism is not just a religion; the Holocaust is only one of many examples of Jews targeted as a people. Exiled after centuries in the Land of Israel, the Jewish people have always been outsiders — they have been pushed out of Europe and the Middle East, and 2019 FBI data indicate American Jews were 2.6 times more likely than Black people and 2.2 times more likely than Muslims to be victims of hate crimes.
If this isn’t proof of a Jewish need for self-determination, I don’t know what is. And yet this editorial does not even affirm support for Jewish self-determination. Does the Editorial Board believe Israel even has a right to exist? Because, if so, that line is coincidentally missing.
When the Editorial Board discusses “Palestinian liberation,” does it think that, after decades of rejected peace treaties and terror, Hamas and the PA would simply acquiesce and live in harmony with their Jewish neighbors? What does the Editorial Board think “from the river to the sea” means?
The Editorial Board believes it is advocating for the underdog in the name of social justice, but the “overwhelming power imbalance” has always been against the Jewish homeland, surrounded on all sides by those who wish to destroy it — the same wish that has led Israel’s neighbors to declare war on it again and again. The leaders of Iran, now in the process of acquiring nuclear weapons, have also made clear that their aim is “the annihilation of Israel.”
I do my best to keep my personal views out of my work at The Crimson. My job is to report facts, and I welcome dialogue. But dialogue is not the goal of BDS or student anti-Israel groups, who have refused conversation and rely instead on substanceless platitudes like “Zionism is racism settler colonialism white supremacy apartheid” — their goal is demonizing Israel and delegitimizing its right to exist.
And so when my people and our homeland come under attack, I will not stay silent. I am still a Crimson editor, but this editorial does not represent me; I do and always will stand with Israel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, er, tonight, I want to pull back the curtain on the writing process for the words you’re reading. Today (Saturday) was a bad executive function day, meaning that it took until 11:20 p.m. for me to even open this document and start typing. And then it took another five minutes for me to muster the energy to write the next sentence.
ADHD is something that I’ve had for as long as I can remember, even if I didn’t know that I had it. It’s something that affects every facet of my existence, even if you’re not aware of it behind these words, or even if I do everything I can to make sure that you don’t notice it (old masking habits die hard). People seem to think of neurodivergent identities as ones that exist sporadically, confined to their own boxes — when in reality, especially for neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and autism, they always exist, since they’re fundamentally part of who we are.
So today, I want to go back to where it all began for me writing this column: being neurodivergent at Harvard. Having bad executive function days here. Existing at Harvard.
Part of the ability to continue stems simply from not knowing what possibilities for better existed. As Kris King ’24, who is autistic with ADHD and comorbid learning difficulties, wrote in a statement to me, “It is because I never experienced true accessibility I was able to survive at Harvard. I did not know that I deserved better, that I could have better. This is the responsibility of no individual, but rather a system that is inaccessible at every. possible. turn.”
Add to the fact that, as Jailene Ramos ‘24 points out, “Harvard is a major stressor.” Ramos, who has ADHD and clinical depression,  continues, “Despite all the things they say, all the things they try to advertise, Harvard very much is not a safe space for BIPOC FGLI students, definitely not, and it probably won’t be for a long time.”
Upon coming to Harvard, I realized that my life was extraordinarily unsustainable. I was fully nocturnal, so overworked that I was missing meals, and my raging perfectionism had reached new levels that I didn’t even know were possible from the stress of doing a week’s worth of assignments in a night.
Yet, despite my struggles, it took me far longer than expected to provide myself with the space to acknowledge that it might not just be me because of how intense and unhealthy the work culture is at Harvard.
By second semester, I had a bad enough breakdown that flipped the switch from “my study habits are quirky and unorthodox,” to “I really need help. I can’t go on like this.”
If anything, knowing I’m neurodivergent has allowed me to take the time and compassion to forgive myself for bad executive function days or crashing for the second night in a row while writing a piece (it’s now Monday morning).
Maya P. ’24 summarizes Harvard’s lack of inclusivity, especially for neurodivergent students: “Harvard's really intense,” and “it's not very inclusive of people who operate in other ways.” Maya, who has ADHD and an excoriation disorder, explains: “Even though there hasn't really been anything explicitly said to me, I definitely feel like I've been forgotten about by a system that's supposed to be inclusive of everyone.”
Though I and other neurodivergent students don’t hear it enough, we belong here, and we deserve to have similar opportunities and support to attain success, even though that’s far from the reality.
It’s not that we’re not successful — as Maya explains, “My grades have been fine because I always managed, but I’ve been managing at the expense of my well-being.”
In this regard though, we deserve to celebrate our creativity, our inventiveness, and our solutions to find ways to attain success with limited support and additional barriers. As Maya notes, “there are definitely things that I think I'm better at purely because I've been forced to become better at it to compensate for other lapses,” from learning how to synthesize large amounts of information quickly or develop the skills necessary to get three psets done in one night by oneself, as Maya used to last semester.
I know that no matter how much I write, no one will ever exactly be able to understand my or others’ experiences with neurodiversity. These are just a handful of stories from Harvard students who identify with neurodiversity, and that’s all they are. And really, it doesn’t have to be about everyone else. If this piece makes one more person acknowledge their accomplishments or provides others with the validation I once felt when I read about a student at Yale discovering they had ADHD, that would be plenty.
As I wrap up the draft for this, nearly 36 hours later, I’m still in my pajamas, still sitting on my bed, hunched over my laptop in my disaster zone of a room. Yet, even if I am not as hyper-productive as Harvard typically necessitates, my ADHD and I — on both good and bad executive function days — still belong here all the same. And you do, too.

To the editor:
In general I think the content of the Crimson should be up to undergraduates not alumni, and in the almost 30 years since I was president this is the first time I can remember that I am furious enough to write with a complaint. That is an indicator of how disgusted I was with the staff editorial, published the morning after Holocaust Remembrance Day, singling out Israel, among all other nations, for boycott, divestment, and sanctions.
What would Harvard boycotting Israel look like?
It would be a less diverse and inclusive Harvard. The Harvard University diversity and inclusion website states “we all belong here. Together, we strive to create an environment that values diversity, promotes an inclusive culture, and establishes a profound sense of belonging for each member of our community.” How are Israeli students, or Jewish students, supposed to feel valued and included when the Crimson is calling for a boycott of the Jewish state — literally, advocating exclusion in the form of unlawful discrimination on the basis of religion and national origin.
It would be a less educationally sound Harvard. How would students be supposed to study the history of Israel or the Middle East without interacting with any Israelis or without visiting Israel?
It would be a less healthy Harvard. No Pfizer coronavirus vaccine — Israeli public health data was used to validate its use here in America. No life-saving Teva generic pharmaceutical medicines dispensed at Harvard’s teaching hospitals.
It would be a less environmentally friendly Harvard. No chance of eating vegetables grown with water-saving Israeli drip-irrigation agricultural technology. No gas-saving self-driving cars equipped with Israeli Lidar technology.
It would be a less secure Harvard. No chance of using Israeli-proven missile defense technology like the Arrow or Iron Dome to protect Cambridge from missile attacks.
The Crimson’s position is so extreme it is almost laughably obsolete. Just months after diplomats from Israel’s Arab neighbors such as the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Egypt and Bahrain showed up in Israel to deepen trade, security and people-to-people ties, the Crimson wants to revert to the bad old days of Arab rejectionism.
If the Crimson has any sense it will apologize for the editorial and admit that it contradicts every important Harvard, journalistic and human value. In the old days, when the Crimson had paying subscribers and paying advertisers, some of them might cancel in response to such an antisemitic outrage. Nowadays, the paper is propped up by annual giving from alumni. We may ask ourselves why we’d volunteer anything — time, money, expertise — to fund an organization participating in a campaign to wipe the Jewish state off the map and to rid Harvard of any Israelis. It’s certainly nothing I feel like I want anything to do with.
Ira E. Stoll ’94 was President of The Crimson in 1993.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 4, 2022 at 4:17 p.m.
Harvard faculty voted to eliminate shopping week in favor of a previous-term course registration system on Tuesday, ending a decades-old scheduling quirk that allowed students to sample courses before enrolling during the first week of each semester.
More than 60 percent of faculty voted in favor of the previous-term registration system, which will require students to register for classes at the end of the previous semester, starting for Spring 2024. The vote comes despite organizing efforts from students and some high-profile professors who lobbied faculty to keep shopping week.
With the passage of the proposal on Tuesday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences formed a committee of faculty, students, and administrators who will be tasked with crafting an implementation plan for the new system.
Under the newly-adopted system, students will be able to add or drop courses without instructor approval during the first week of the semester. Instructors will be required to prepare course material earlier.
In addition, student advising timelines will adjust to the new course registration schedule. The legislation also calls for “technological enhancements” to make Harvard’s course registration process smoother.
Faculty debated the new system for about one hour prior to the vote at Tuesday’s faculty meeting.
Bernhard Nickel, professor of Philosophy who chairs the FAS’ Committee on Course Registration, said prior to the vote on Tuesday that “nothing short of previous-term registration” will better allow undergraduates to explore their course options while providing them with “robust” advising.
“The case for previous-term registration is an educational case, first and foremost,” he said. “It is not an administrative case.”
Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, professor of Fine Arts, questioned when faculty would have the time to conduct research for their courses, since previous-term registration requires faculty to post syllabi and course material earlier than what is currently required.
In response, Nickel said the previous-term registration system would require course materials in March for the fall and October or November for the spring, which avoids the difficulties of planning courses over breaks.
Earlier this semester, a group of undergraduates calling for faculty to preserve shopping week submitted a counterproposal in response to the Committee on Course Registration recommending a move to the previous-term system.
Some faculty say the shopping week system creates instability for teaching staff because enrollment numbers remain unknown until the second week of the semester. Susanna C. Siegel, a professor of Philosophy, said the counterproposal treats teaching fellows as if they were “fungible items” that could be distributed over classes.
Undergraduates who support shopping week criticized the vote.
William A. Mcconnell ’22 wrote in an email that the adoption of previous-term registration demonstrates the need for greater student representation in school decisions.
“Not the end of the world, but I think it’s a real loss for Harvard,” he wrote. “I predict lower average Q scores, fewer humanities concentrators, and a more pre-professional campus climate. This mistake highlights the need for students to have a bigger seat at the table for campus decision-making.”
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, the former president of the Undergraduate Council who led the effort to dissolve the body last month in favor of a new student government, wrote in an email that the new system is “a historic mistake.”
“Education should not be about technocratic pre-planning, but rather genuine learning,” he wrote.
LyLena D. Estabine ’24, one of the newly-elected co-presidents of the Harvard Undergraduate Association, wrote in an email that she respects the vote, but will continue to advocate for undergraduates to be included in determining how the new system will be implemented.
“I cannot stress enough that the work is not done just because pre-registration passed,” she wrote.
The Faculty Council — a 19-person committee that makes recommendations on FAS legislation — will review the previous-term registration system five years in and develop a report for the faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, as Harvard prepared to fully reopen its campus to students for the first time in more than a year, preventing the spread of Covid-19 was top of mind.
Harvard, after all, had kept most students off campus for the entire 2020-2021 academic year — a more conservative approach than many other schools in the Boston area — leaving affiliates unsure of what the return to campus would bring.
In July, as the new semester loomed, administrators in Adams House installed a set of air disinfection devices that appeared to be a part of the solution to preventing the spread of the virus in the house. The price tag was just shy of $9,000 — a reduced rate.
But the devices — which were installed in the house’s dining hall and lower common room — lasted just a few weeks. Less than a month into the the semester, Harvard shut them off, following a recommendation from the University’s Coronavirus Advisory Group. By the end of December, they were removed entirely.
The devices, which resemble fluorescent lamps, use germicidal ultraviolet light to disinfect the air. Once airborne pathogens are exposed to a certain level of UV radiation, they can become inactivated and no longer contagious.
But according to Adams House Faculty Dean Salmaan Keshavjee, the University’s Covid advisory group determined that the installation of the new devices was unnecessary on top of existing ventilation systems.
Thirteen UVGI units were installed in July by AeroMed Technologies, which manufactures the devices. UVGI has been researched and used to “eliminate airborne pathogens” for over 70 years, according to the CDC.
Adams Faculty Dean Salmaan Keshavjee wrote in an email that the decision to install the technology came from a “collaboration” with one of the outgoing faculty deans at the time, John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67.
Keshavjee, a global health professor, wrote that studies demonstrating that a certain type of UV light can inactivate viruses like Covid-19 helped inform the decision. He added that the fixtures were in spaces where people would be eating without masks: the dining hall and lower common room.
Asked about his involvement, Palfrey wrote that “this was a project of the new faculty dean’s that sounded innovative and an excellent way to limit the spread of COVID.”
Bill Palmer, AeroMed’s vice president, wrote in an email that there were plans to add the devices in “another common room and other spaces at Adams, but a decision was made to begin with those two areas before moving forward with any others.”
The equipment, installation, and safety testing cost Adams House $8,900, according to Palmer — a figure that Keshavjee had significantly negotiated down.
The lights were on for just two to three weeks.
Then, Harvard’s Covid advisory group — a University-wide committee that provides recommendations on Covid-19 protocols — recommended that the devices be switched off and later removed, according to Keshavjee.
“[The group] determined that ventilation methods already in place were well suited for that space, and the determination was made that the upper room germicidal lighting did not add much,” Keshavjee wrote.
Still, Keshavjee emphasized the technology’s benefits, citing its long history of use in hospital wards and research that showed transmission of “influenza was reduced by 90%” in wards with UVGI. He called UVGI “important as an extra layer where you have large numbers of people and a high potential for transmission.”
Before he brought the fixtures to Adams, Keshavjee and Harvard School of Public Health professor Edward Nardell recommended the technology to Cambridge Friends School, where the devices are currently installed.
Keshavjee wrote that after the installment, Cambridge Friends “was able to remain open throughout the COVID-19 epidemic with no ensuing in-school transmission to date.”
On its website, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says “UVGI can be part of a plan to protect people indoors” when combined with other public health practices, but by itself, “using an UVGI system is not enough to protect people from COVID-19.”
The EPA warns that improper installation can result in hazardous levels of radiation and cause skin or eye injuries. Devices designed specifically for the disinfection of indoor spaces are typically installed at a minimum height so that the UV light is directed above the occupied space.
Palmer said that in testing, the fixtures were below threshold limits for exposure to UV radiation.
“These fixtures were installed at a height exceeding what the UL [safety] test would recommend and safety tests done on-site confirmed that the installation complied with safety standards,” Palmer wrote.
Keshavjee confirmed “the fixtures are louvered to face upward” so no light would reflect downward onto Adams residents.
He added that labels were placed near the fixtures to warn workers performing maintenance.
The technology’s installment and removal were not announced to Adams residents over the House email list. But Keshavjee said students were made aware in other ways.
“There was a framed explanation card with a QR code at the entrance to the Dining Hall. As well, when students asked, the technology was explained to them,” he wrote.
Asked why the fixtures were not expanded to the other houses, Keshavjee wrote the project was “very specific to the incoming FDs.”
Palmer said Harvard asked AeroMed to tour spaces like dining halls and libraries in other houses after installing the fixtures in Adams.
“We had agreed with Dean Keshavjee that we would provide this discounted price for other installations done within that calendar year,” he wrote. “But nothing happened after our tour of those spaces.”

Harvard Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister said the University’s revenues have “rebounded” to pre-pandemic levels, placing Harvard in a “healthy” financial condition, in an interview last week.
Last fiscal year, Harvard saw its revenues drop by $124 million — fueled by the reduction in room and board income due to fewer students living on campus — marking the first time the University experienced two consecutive years of declining revenues since the Great Depression. Despite the drop in revenue, an influx of current-use gifts and savings in operational costs allowed the University to finish the fiscal year with a $283 million surplus.
After the return to in-person operations last fall, Hollister said revenues from tuition and room and board are back to 2019 levels, though he noted that not all revenue streams have recovered completely.
“Some areas such as parking fees, service fees of various kinds have not rebounded fully back,” he said.
He also noted that record levels of inflation and “signs of weakness in the stock market” may decrease the amount of current use gifts and endowment contributions Harvard receives this year.
During the interview, Hollister also addressed the following topics:
In recent months, Harvard has eased its Covid-19 policies, lifting its mask mandate and announcing it will discontinue all mandatory viral testing by May 10.
Though Hollister called the reduction of spending on safety restrictions “helpful” for Harvard’s finances, he said that the University continues to spend heavily on pandemic measures.
“Testing and tracing continues to be front and center,” he said. “But as the faculty learns and gives feedback on what's most effective, and how to teach in a hybrid fashion, reconfiguring classrooms is a lot of [the] spending that is being done and being planned for the future.”
The University also recently terminated its Coronavirus Workplace Policies — which expired on April 1 — ending emergency paid sick leave benefits and partial compensation for idled workers.
Hollister said financial considerations were not part of the decision, noting that Harvard’s idled workers are simply “back to work.”
Last month, the College announced an increase in the financial aid threshold beginning with the Class of 2026 — promising families who earn less than $75,000 will pay nothing for the cost of attendance.
To address the increasing costs, Hollister said the Faculty of Arts and Sciences engages in “scenario planning” and tries to “stretch the dollars” to efficiently meet its needs, noting that funds for financial aid do not entirely come from the University’s endowment.
“Not all of our undergraduate financial aid is endowed, so the money does have to come from somewhere else,” he said. “ Often, it's the annual funds from donors that make up the shortfall.”
Hollister said “it’s not always easy” to effectively allocate money within the FAS budget. However, he said financial aid remains at the “top of the list.”
“The planners at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences make projections many years out,” he said. “They try to ready themselves to continue to fulfill that financial aid promise.”
Hollister said the pandemic still adds “enormous uncertainty” to Harvard’s financials, but praised the University’s continued scenario planning to ensure it remains prepared for changing circumstances. He also said Harvard is “affirmatively” prepared and planning for a possible recession, pointing to the University’s “recession playbook,” released in 2019.
“Harvard tries to be disciplined in our financial planning,” he said. “We've been doing that for many years.”
Hollister called the uncertainty of the pandemic one of the most “difficult and crazy” parts of the University’s financial planning in recent years.
“We try to ready ourselves in the event that things change,” he said. “And Harvard, because of its planning — and that's a credit to many throughout the University — continues to pursue its mission effectively in challenging times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The group suing Harvard and the University of North Carolina over their race-conscious admissions practices asked the United States Supreme Court to ban affirmative action in American higher education in a brief filed Monday, calling on justices to overturn precedents that allow universities to consider race as a factor in admissions.
The court agreed in January to take up a pair of lawsuits filed by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions that claim Harvard College and the University of North Carolina discriminate against Asian American applicants. SFFA’s Monday brief is the first major filing since the court announced it would take up the cases.
In the 99-page filing, SFFA called on justices to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court’s 2003 decision that said the University of Michigan Law School could consider race as a factor in its admission process.
“Grutter should be overruled, as it satisfies every factor that this Court considers when deciding to overrule precedent,” the filing said. “It was wrong the day it was decided, has spawned significant negative consequences, and has generated no legitimate reliance interests.”
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging that the College’s race-conscious admissions process violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.” Two lower courts previously ruled in Harvard’s favor before SFFA appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which agreed to take up the lawsuit alongside a similar one against UNC.
Harvard and UNC are required to submit response briefs by July 25. Amicus briefs in support of SFFA must be filed by May 9.
In its brief, SFFA argued that Grutter “flouts basic equal-protection principles” set by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But it said the schools violate current federal law regardless of the 2003 ruling.
Harvard “penalizes Asian Americans, engages in racial balancing, overemphasizes race, and rejects workable race-neutral alternatives,” the filing said.
SFFA argued that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants with its “personal rating” scores that are assigned to every applicant.
“Harvard’s mistreatment of Asian-American applicants is particularly striking: Its admissions process penalizes them for supposedly lacking as much leadership, confidence, likability, or kindness as white applicants,” the brief said.
Harvard denies the claims, noting on its website that the percentage of Asian Americans in its admitted class has grown by more than 25 percent since 2010.
In an emailed statement, Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane defended the school’s admissions process.
“More than 40 years of Supreme Court precedent have held that race can be one of many factors considered in college admissions,” she wrote.
SFFA wrote that Harvard engages in “racial balancing” and that the school “does not use race as a mere plus to achieve overall diversity.”
“At Harvard, race matters more than every other diversity factor and all but the most elusive academic and extracurricular factors,” the brief said.
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a statement after the court took up the case that “considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions produces a more diverse student body which strengthens the learning environment for all.”
Dane wrote that “Harvard will continue to vigorously defend its admissions practices.”
“In an increasingly diverse workplace and world, colleges must have the ability to create diverse learning communities needed to prepare students to succeed,” she wrote.
In a press release Monday afternoon, SFFA’s president, Edward J. Blum, wrote that the Harvard and UNC cases “are rescue missions for the colorblind legal principles that hold together Americans of all races and ethnicities.”

As acceptance rates to the country’s most selective universities fall to all-time lows each year, more elite schools have stopped promoting key admissions data, including acceptance numbers and demographic breakdowns.
This year, three Ivy League schools — the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Princeton — declined to release admissions data on the day acceptance letters were sent out, a trend Stanford started in 2018. Cornell first stopped publicizing its data in 2020.
Schools are required by the federal government to report admissions data each year — but the numbers come out months after admissions decisions, buried in a Department of Education documents and Common Data Set filings.
In August 2018, as future 2023 college graduates began filling out applications, Stanford University announced it would not publish its admissions data when decisions would be released. The year prior, the school’s acceptance rate was just 4.3 percent — the lowest in the country.
“The main result we observe is stories that aim to identify which universities experience the most demand and have the lowest admit rates,” Stanford Provost Persis Drell said in the 2018 announcement. “That is not a race we are interested in being a part of.”
Most of its peer institutions — including Harvard — initially declined to follow suit.
But two years later, Cornell announced it would also stop publicizing its data, beginning with the class of 2024, for which it only published early decision numbers.
This year, two more Ivies — Princeton and Penn — followed.
Harvard has continued to release its admissions data — including this March, when the College accepted a record-low 3.19 percent of applicants. Asked about the school’s policies, Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote that the school has “made no decisions regarding sharing this information.”
The elite institutions that have stopped publicizing data all cited the effect the numbers can have on prospective applicants, given increased selectivity.
“Neither prospective students nor the University benefit from the admissions process being boiled down in headlines to a single statistic like the admission rate,” Princeton University’s Dean of Admissions Karen Richardson wrote in a column earlier this month. “We do not want to discourage prospective students from applying to Princeton because of its selectivity.”
But some admissions consultants remain skeptical of the true motivations behind the shift.
“I understand the mental health perspective, but at the same time, it may be that some of these schools are looking to get more people to apply,” said Dan Lee, co-founder of Solomon Admissions Consulting.
Lee said “elite universities are always trying to increase the applicant pool every year” due to “institutional objectives.”
“Because of that, this may simply just be a method they’re experimenting with to potentially get more applicants next year,” he said.
Lee said he thinks the move may be a move on the part of the schools to see if “more people will apply as a result of not being turned off by the 2, 3, 4 percent acceptance rate.”
Spokespeople from Princeton, Penn, Stanford, and Cornell did not respond to requests for comment about the claim.
Phillip Trout, a college counselor at Minnetonka High School in Minnesota who formerly served as president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said he doesn’t “know of a good reason why a college or university would choose to stop announcing, or to be unwilling, to confirm their acceptance rates.”
“But I can see why it is that this could occur,” Trout said. “A college like Stanford or Princeton or Cornell, perhaps, doesn’t want to appear to be elitist or unapproachable.”
“Some of these acceptance rates are just ridiculously low,” he said.
College admissions experts said influential annual rankings may influence the change.
“I think it is more around the optics of prestige,” said Anna Ivey, founder of Anna Ivey Admissions Counseling who formerly ran the University of Chicago Law School’s admissions office.
Lee said applicants often put more stock in schools’ rankings than the strength of their particular programs.
“One thing we encounter a lot is a lot of students are simply just brainwashed by the rankings,” Lee said. “It doesn’t matter whether you tell them that a certain school is actually much better for computer science than a higher-ranked school overall, they’ll still want to go to the higher-ranked school.”
Trout, the former NACAC president, echoed the sentiments, saying that colleges take pride in the number of students who apply.
“Totally driven by rankings,” Trout said. “Colleges and universities benefit greatly from moving up the chain.”
Despite schools’ claims that the shift was made in an effort to decrease stress among prospective applicants, some students and consultants said a lack of transparency will be unhelpful.
“Knowing doesn’t necessarily change many things, but it does give you a sense of comfort, being given that extra information,” said Omenma P. Abengowe, a student in Harvard's newly-admitted Class of 2026. “Having that being taken away just kind of feels strange.”
Ryan D. Garcia, another accepted student, concurred.
“I 100 percent wish they would release that data,” said Garcia. “The unknown to me would scare me the most.”
Trout said publishing acceptance rates can be helpful to students.
“I think announcing and sharing the data in a transparent way is helpful, and I think it serves students,” he said. “I do not know that it, in any way, alleviates or lessens stress.”
Consultants praised Harvard’s move to continue publicizing its acceptance rates, citing the importance of transparency.
“I think Harvard is doing the right thing by releasing its acceptance rates,” Lee said. “Just being transparent about what the actual acceptance rate is is always going to be helpful to students.”
Aditya Tummala, another admitted student, said some schools’ decision to not promote admissions data may be more of a “play to publicity.”
“I don’t think it really has an effect pragmatically,” Tummala said. “I think you may as well release the acceptance rates, get a little more transparency — that’s always nice.”
Lee said elite institutions often move in sync regarding admissions.
“Princeton, UPenn, Cornell are testing this out, and other institutions are going to look at that and see what the impact of that policy has on the number of applicants next year,” he said. “Based on that, they will assess whether this is a good idea for them as well.”
Though the data is still made available through the federal government and the Common Data Set later in the year, Ivey said the change will impact applicants who “aren’t already savvy about this process.”
“There’s a fair amount of cynicism among applicants about holistic admissions because it does look like such a big black box,” Ivey said. “And anything that makes it more of a black box by intent? I think that's going in the wrong direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A research center at the Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has postponed a panel on autism awareness after an undergraduate-authored petition garnered more than 1,400 signatures condemning the College for publicizing the event.
The petition, circulated widely on Change.org, calls on Harvard College to publicly “withdraw support” for an event titled “Autism Awareness: Thinking Outside the Box” hosted by the Sadhguru Center for a Conscious Planet — a multidisciplinary research center at the BIDMC, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital. The authors of the petition alleged the College implicitly supported the event by including it in a Weekly Update email to undergraduates.
The event, described as a “multidisciplinary panel to explore Autism beyond conventions,” was set to feature nine speakers. After the petition was circulated, the event listing for the panel, which was set to occur virtually last Wednesday, was taken down.
“One of the panel’s goals is to highlight methods of ‘treating’ Autism. This is not only violently ableist but scientifically incorrect,” the petition reads. “Adding in phrases like ‘how to communicate’ and ‘savant autism’ in conjunction suggest an alien-like nature to Autistic people. We are human, too.”
In an emailed statement, a Sadhguru Center spokesperson apologized for “any unintended distress” due to the event and wrote that the Center postponed the panel after learning of the concerns in the petition.
“We are grateful to those who brought important aspects of the event to light and always intend for our actions to be respectful and inclusive,” the statement read. “We are pausing, deeply reflecting and learning before we consciously take next steps.”
Kristin B. King ’23-’24 authored and circulated the petition among Harvard students and autism advocates at other colleges after the event was publicized in the weekly. The petition, originally a Google Doc, was signed by more than 170 Harvard affiliates before moving to Change.org, where it garnered many more signatures.
King said they found the event “problematic from the get-go” due to the lack of autistic speakers and the language used by the panelists.
“Talking about things like treating and curing autism is a really toxic narrative. There isn’t anything wrong with being autistic,” King said. “That’s something that autistic people have to say every single day of their lives.”
Nina M. Jensen ’25, an autistic student on a leave of absence who signed the initial petition, said she first learned about the event through the College’s Weekly Update email — a newsletter sent to undergraduates publicizing announcements and events every Thursday.
Jensen, who said she reached out to the College about the event’s inclusion in the email, said the College claimed that publicizing the event in the email does not constitute an endorsement.
“It’s really sad to see that Harvard is not taking responsibility for being part of this,” Jensen said. “Even though they’re not hosting the event, they should still have better policy for how to avoid putting something like this in the weekly when it’s actually very harmful to autistic students.”
Harvard College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Weekly Update is used to inform College affiliates about “events and engagement opportunities.”
“Items are submitted via Harvard and its affiliates,” he wrote. “Feedback on specific events should be directed to the individual event sponsor.”
The petition specifically condemned the language of panelist Marcia L. Hinds, the author of a book entitled “I Know You’re In There: Winning Our War Against Autism,” calling it “violent.”
Hinds said she understands the perspective of the petition and believes having autistic people on the panel would improve it, but she said she stands by the title of her book because it refers to her “personal war” raising an autistic son.
“Every once in a while, on a good day, I would catch a glimpse of the kid he was supposed to be before he slipped away again,” she said. “That’s the reason for the title, ‘I Know You’re In There: Winning Our War Against Autism.’ Autism was trying to steal my son and I couldn’t let that happen. And that’s why for me it was a war.”
King wrote in an update to the petition that they met with a representative from the Sadhguru Center on Friday to suggest “education, reparations and public apology.”
“I’m hoping that this event came from a place of ignorance rather than malicious intent,” King said. “But certainly, with the depth of ignorance that came through in the different layers of problems that existed with the event, it came across really maliciously.”
Three co-founders of the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club also signed the original petition. HUDJ co-founder Benjamin T. Elwy ’23 wrote in an email to The Crimson that HUDJ “unequivocally supports” the petition and condemns Harvard’s promotion of the event.
“While Harvard strives to improve itself in diversity and equity as it relates to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, to name a few areas, it must also include disability,” Elwy wrote. “It’s time that Harvard takes responsibility and proactively works towards creating the inclusive community it claims to believe in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, CONN. – Saturday marked the end of a great regular season run for the No. 12 men’s lacrosse team, with a narrow defeat against archrival No. 9 Yale, which won on an overtime score from veteran midfielder Thomas Bragg. Harvard (8-4, 3-3) battled to the very end, ultimately losing, 17-16, on a man-down goal that sealed Yale’s title as Ivy League regular season champions. The loss sealed the Crimson’s fate, eliminating it from Ivy Tournament contention. Harvard ranks No.15 in Division I, however, so there is a chance that the team might qualify for the NCAA Tournament on a wild card bid.
“This was a battle where no lead was safe. We lost several players to injury in the game but kept fighting back to take the lead late in [the fourth quarter],” head coach Gerry Byrne said. “We had our chances to win, but Yale made one more play than we did.”
The game started off in Yale’s hands, as the Bulldogs pulled out a three-goal run in the first few minutes of play. However, Harvard put in senior FOGO Kyle Massimilian on the x, energizing the unit, which began to win both initial clamps and get the ball out to the wings to battle for the scrums. The trios on the circle performed well against Bulldogs star FOGO Nicholas Ramsey, with Massimilian going 4-9 and senior Steven Cuccurullo going 9-26. Sophomore LSM Greg Campisi, first-year LSM Martin Nelson, first-year midfielder Andrew O’Berry and junior midfielder Chase Yager were pivotal in the scrums, clearing the ball to the attacking end. This was an area that the Crimson needed to capitalize on in order to keep play even, as the squad struggled to gain possessions early on in previous contests.
The team had a bit of a struggle clearing the ball early on against Yale’s ferocious 10-man ride, but began to find its rhythm, consistently clearing to the attacking end; senior goalie Kyle Mullin was pivotal in this process, clearing long-bombs and even taking the ball across the 50 himself. Mullin put up a valiant effort for the Crimson before he was injured diving for a loose ground ball in the third quarter. Sophomore Christian Barnard stepped up for the team, overcoming nerves to make big stops for Harvard. Barnard has not seen much play yet this season, but was confident and composed in goal, keeping the Crimson tight with the Bulldogs for the remainder of the game. Yale wasn’t able to seize momentum with Mullin’s injury, Barnard made plays, clearing well and leading the defense in the pivotal contest.
“It was definitely a bummer to see Mullin go down,” Barnard commented.“It’s part of being the backup goalie, you have to be ready at all times … Hopefully we get a next game.”
The offense played a cohesive game, overcoming nerves in the first few minutes of play with a goal from O’Berry, who dominated on both the offensive and defensive sides of the field. The starting group of senior Austin Madronic, who recorded a hat trick, junior Hayden Cheek, who notched two goals, and first-year Sam King, who tallied a goal and two assists, was balanced by clean play from first-year midfielders Miles Botkiss, Owen Gaffney, who had three points, Andrew Perry (two goals and two assists), Lucas Hilsenrath, who had a goal, and Joe Dowling. Dowling, who recorded three goals and an assist, was a standout for the day. He has only been tested in a few settings due to an injury early in the season, but showed composure on the field.Veterans senior Charlie Olmert and junior Isaiah Dawson brought experience, drawing on past tight contests to act as leaders on the field. Overall, the offense played a clean game, picking up play to stay in the game by executing crisp sets after forcing the ball and making silly mistakes early on.
“A lot of the young guys stepped up,” Dowling said. “We are gonna learn a lot from this loss, take what we can from film, and get better in the off season. Props to Yale, they played really well, but the future's looking bright.”
The defense, which consisted of first-years Collin Bergstrom and Tommy Martinson, as well as junior Chase Strupp, played a well-timed game, shutting down plays on the fast break and keeping Yale wide on its settled sets. The defense played well one-on-one, with first-year midfielder Ray Dearth playing physically, but there was some miscommunication down low on the crease with the Bulldogs taking advantage of the switch, which allowed their stars Matt Brandau, who has the second most points in Division-1, and Leo Johnson, to test the shorties. This, coupled with a few late slides, resulted in some easy Bulldog possessions; the unit will also look to improve on its man-down play, as it allowed Yale to score on all four of its attempts. Overall, the defense played a tight game to remain competitive with the tenth-highest scoring offense in the country. All season, the unit has been a positive that the Crimson, which will see all of its defensive starters return in 2023, can hope to build off of in the offseason.
“Defensively, we played well but we needed to guard better on ball. They moved the ball really well on offense and we can’t afford to slide as often as we did,” Campisi said. “This has been and will continue to be a point of emphasis for us.”
When asked about the implications of the final game of the season being against Ancient Eight rival Yale, first-year Joe Dowling said that while there is a heightened sense of competition, the team treated it as just another competitive game that they would look to prepare for and win.
“Obviously, Harvard-Yale is huge,” he said. “We have been unproven in the Ivy League and Yale has been the top dog. I think we had a little fire to knock them off the pedestal and I think we did a little bit. I think we gave them a good shot and a lot of people going into this game didn’t have us at this level with Yale, so I think it just shows how tough this group is, how the seniors lead from the front. We will come away stronger.”
The Crimson will hope to implement the lessons it learned against Yale if it qualifies for the NCAA Tournament, which will begin on May 28 in East Hartford, Conn.
“In defeat, we have redefined this rivalry and made clear our arrival to the upper tier of the [Inside Lacrosse rankings],” Byrne said.
