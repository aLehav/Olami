After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is tempting to “Covid-shame” — to gossip about people who have been travelling every weekend, going to huge parties, or flouting CDC and local guidelines. We swiftly condemn those who throw caution to the wind. However, Covid-shaming is misdirected anger that should instead be pointed towards government officials who have succeeded in placing the burden of responsibility upon residents instead of stepping up and instituting restrictions.
I, too, find myself falling into the trap of Covid-shaming, frowning when I see people behaving irresponsibly and patting myself on the back for being at least more careful than some other people. However, I am sure that my own behavior at times seems irresponsible to others; I have certainly not been perfect this past year, and amongst my friends, I fall in the middle of the spectrum for adherence to social distancing guidelines. While I’ve avoided larger gatherings, I find myself well within six feet of complete strangers every time I go to CVS or Target. I am not the most or least cautious, leaving me in the position to judge and also be judged. I suspect that many others find themselves somewhere in this middle ground as well.
As I condemn Covid-shaming, I should clarify that I don’t think that anyone should necessarily get a “pass” for reckless behavior; safety guidelines are important and one of the ways we can limit the spread of a dangerous virus. However, it is troubling that so much of America’s response to Covid-19 has been rooted in personal responsibility and individual action, relying on each of us to be on our best behavior.
For example, the City of Cambridge has a list of guidelines surrounding take-out restaurants and food markets, one of which instructs employees to “be considerate by speaking softly with head turned (less projection of droplets) and breath [sic] through nose, not mouth.” While small behavioral modifications might stop the spread, this advice is laughable in comparison with the City Council’s recent vote against adding capacity restrictions to indoor dining. Instead of taking more direct action to stop Covid-19, government officials seem content to try to have their cake and eat it too. They place the onus on their constituents to be altruistic and responsible and hope cases stay low.
However, there are consequences for seemingly contradictory advisories. Illogical government guidelines undermine the credibility of preventative measures as a whole and make it dangerous to rely upon personal responsibility . In December, Governor Charles D. Baker Jr. ’79 temporarily instituted a stay-at-home order for Massachusetts, encouraging residents to stay at home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., although many have since questioned whether these curfews are effective.
After over a year of living in various stages of lockdown and reopening, it has become clear that the pandemic has led us to rely heavily upon performative gestures which do little in the way of prevention. Extreme displays of hygiene and caution that some have dubbed “Hygiene Theater,” like constantly scrubbing down tables or scanning temperatures, do not do much to prevent the spread of the virus and instead provide a false sense of security. Out of fear of public shaming, many people have taken pains to hide their less careful activities from their social media feeds, but the effects of their actions still exist.
Clearly, we need to be more concerned with substance than appearance, but a culture of shaming points us in the wrong direction. It seems that many Covid-shamers enjoy affirming their own goodness and decency by distancing themselves from rule-breakers, but this performance has no real benefits for anybody else. If the last 12 months have taught us anything, Covid-shaming fails to actually stop people from acting irresponsibly. Shaming others teaches them to avoid being truthful when they do make mistakes. Instead of avoiding social gatherings, many people have simply stopped posting about them. After over a year of Covid-shaming, it’s clear that it’s not working.
Drawing moral assumptions about people based on their adherence to these rules ultimately only plays into the narrative of the importance of individual responsibility during a time when the government should be taking on a bigger role. It also has the danger of distracting us from the more important problems at hand.
Instead of spending so much time and attention (ineffectively) attempting to embarrass rule-breakers into good behavior, we should ask for more from our government officials in regards to vaccine distribution, Covid guidelines, and financial support. We must stop taking cheap shots at anti-maskers and turn to those who are responsible for the current situation and are actually in a position to affect change. Moving towards real progress means moving past Covid shaming for our own benefit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day circled on many students’ calendars finally arrived this Monday. On April 19, all Massachusetts residents ages 16 and older became eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine: a shot at regaining our pre-pandemic lives.
This feels like a moment to celebrate, but it’s also a moment to take careful advantage of, and to approach with responsibility and care.
On the one hand, we are excited about the vaccination opportunities that our friends and classmates have already begun to pursue. Each dose administered will help reduce the increasing number of Covid-19 cases amongst young adults and help set the path back to normalcy for the College. These steps are vital for protecting one another and our neighbors in Cambridge.
We are also heartened to witness the enthusiasm with which members of the Cambridge and Boston community have begun to wrap their arms around the vaccine rollout process. Residents are clamoring for the vaccine: Middlesex and Suffolk Counties have exhibited lower rates of vaccine hesitancy than most of the country. While a population eager to be vaccinated is a public health official’s dream, it also means that some residents may have to wait longer than they had hoped to get their first shot — including Harvard students.
In Cambridge especially, the levels of vaccine supply and demand are quite imbalanced. Even as federally run sites in Boston are fueled with resources, Cambridge’s local rollout efforts have been hampered by continued supply shortages. Harvard University Health Services, too, has not received a supply of vaccines that would allow it to make a dent in either the Cambridge or Harvard student population.
We fear that the vaccine dearth falls harder on the marginalized populations of Cambridge than it does on Harvard students, who have the resources, time, and mobility to travel to get vaccinated: While we want our peers to get vaccinated as soon as possible, we do not want this to come at the expense of local residents in surrounding communities — especially low-income areas already suffering from gentrification. Students receiving the vaccine is great news, but students jetting off to take vaccines from communities that need them is not.
To that end, we urge our peers and Cambridge neighbors in pursuit of vaccinations to carefully research the communities that they are entering; to vigilantly consider whose vaccine slots they may be taking up; and, most profoundly, to be mindful in their actions, understanding that vaccine retrieval — while broadly beneficial — can have countervailing effects if not pursued responsibly.
To be sure, college students here and across the country need to be vaccinated as young people continue to drive up infection rates. Ideally, Massachusetts might establish a program like the state of New York recently did, offering vaccine doses directly to both private and public colleges and universities across the state, and HUHS would in turn be able to vaccinate us all soon. But until then, some of us at Harvard may have to bide our time.
So wait your turn, but not a moment past that. And in the meantime, continue adhering to measures that promise to protect you and your loved ones against Covid-19 — from avoiding unnecessary travel to continuing to faithfully don masks. Finally, when the time is right, get ready to roll up your sleeves and join in on the momentum of the statewide rollout.

“Democracy Days” — a student-led proposal to designate U.S. federal election days as free of classes and full of civic engagement programming — are an excellent idea. We join the chorus of over 1,200 Harvard affiliates (including more than 200 faculty members) urging University President Lawrence S. Bacow to make concrete the University’s commitment to developing the “citizens and citizen leaders” of tomorrow (of which we are constantly reminded) through their implementation.
The Democracy Day proposal calls for university-sponsored programming and community engagement to substitute conventional classes, allowing affiliates time to comfortably vote as well as to reflect on the value of our democratic ideals. At its core, it calls for a pause in the Harvard rat race for the sake of civic duty and contemplation.
This proposal differs from previous calls to designate election day as a University holiday (calls we have supported) in how its organizers envision facilitating a healthy, civic-minded mania overtaking campus in lieu of classes. Rather than a plain day off, Democracy Days’s architects make clear in their impressive, 16-page proposal that they envision federal election days being spent flexing our citizenship muscle: whether that be via voting, volunteering as a poll worker, serving the Cambridge and Boston community, or participating in educational programming.
We believe instituting Democracy Days would prove incredibly beneficial. Civic engagement is an unambiguous good, and devoting a day solely to it would signal Harvard’s commitment to community engagement and civic action, and help usher in a campus culture that puts a genuine premium on these acts as well.
President Bacow says that every member of the Harvard community — staff, students, and faculty — who wants to vote can. Still, we contend that creating a University holiday would make voting, which Bacow has hailed as the “first responsibility of citizenship in a democracy,” instantly less stressful and streamlined, as the burden is taken off the individual to request time off to partake.
Moreover, civic engagement is not just limited to voting — Harvard students can act as poll workers, drive people to the polls, or collaborate with Cambridge and Boston groups to serve our community, among countless other ways to engage with Democracy Day. There is also symbolic value to Harvard delineating a day to democracy; though admin talks a big talk about civic commitment, how many concrete examples of action can they actually point to?
Democracy Days have the potential to be a better version of Harvard’s annual Day of Service, with a focus on one cause — civic engagement — facilitating more concrete and meaningful outcomes.
Designating Election Day as an instruction-free day is also not unprecedented: Brown and Columbia already do this. Harvard can and should learn from its peer institutions and implement Democracy Days. Doing so would give students a new and universal pathway to meaningfully engage with both democracy and the broader Cambridge community. It matters that Harvard students invest in being responsible Cambridge residents and feel a sense of connection to the place that (in normal times, anyway) serves as their home for four years. Democracy Days present a wonderful way to facilitate this symbiotic engagement.
And even if our peers perceive our day for democracy as a “day off” in which they don’t have academic commitments, that’s still a valid use of the day — elections are consequential, and can cause nontrivial stress for many people. Even the Democracy Day proposal recognizes wellness programming as a form of democratic activity. Engaging in democracy need not be exclusively political: It can also be personal and well being focused.
The last time this Editorial Board voiced support for an election day holiday came weeks before the 2020 General Election, which we concede made our ask a steep one. Yet Democracy Days’ organizers have set their sights on the next midterm elections, which will take place in the faraway land of November 2022. Harvard has ample time and a detailed proposal to work with, which goes as far as to outline the bureaucratic structure under which the Days would be carried out — not to mention the enthusiasm of so many. This is feasible.
Harvard, which prides itself as the place where America’s future leaders are created, should allow its affiliates to tangibly partake in democracy without having to balance University-related obligations for one, crucial day. Engaging in civic and community action is important, and breaking from the Harvard bubble to serve communities in Cambridge and Boston is valuable. The Democracy Day proposal, which students have put thought and labor into crafting, facilitates both. All Harvard has to do is say yes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Epidemiology assistant professor Michael Mina discussed the threats that some variants of the coronavirus may pose — despite the fact that tens of millions of people in the U.S. are now fully-vaccinated — during a Harvard School of Public Health Event on Tuesday.
In the forum jointly held by the School of Public Health and The World, a media organization, Mina said that though “not all variants are worrying” — and many are a “normal part of virus biology” — variants that cause the virus to transmit more, cause worse symptoms, and evade the immune system may be concerning.
The issue of invariant transmissibility has more to do with the fact that the virus stays at its peak for longer, rather than the way the virus transmits, according to Mina.
“We believe that the increased transmissibility is generally that the virus has a greater fitness inside the body, meaning it can stay at high amounts of virus for longer and therefore increase its potential to spread to another human,” Mina said.
Mina said the invariants do not currently appear to cause different symptoms than the original coronavirus strain.
When a large proportion of the population is vaccinated, Mina said it is crucial to focus on whether an invariant can escape immunity induced by the current vaccine.
“If we start to see variants escape immunity, then that might mean that we have to go back and boost people with a new vaccine that covers that particular variant,” Mina said.
This may result in an undesirable game of “catch-up” from constantly needing to boost the vaccine for a new invariant, he added.
Mina said there could be a possibility of a universal vaccine, one that “can attack multiple or could protect against multiple different lineages of this virus at once.”
For now, since immunity may wane most quickly in the elderly, they are the ones of utmost concern, Mina said.
“My personal concern is, as the elderly people are the very people we’ve been trying to protect during this virus pandemic, and because they’re the most susceptible, unfortunately, the oldest age classes are also the least equipped to get a new vaccine and really retain immunological memory,” Mina said.
For the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike, exposure to Covid-19 depends on behavior, like wearing masks, and also whether the virus can grow in one’s body, which could happen even in those who are vaccinated, Mina said.
However, viruses growing in a host that is already immune potentially "boosts our immune system" because "it gives us a reminder of the virus that we’re trying to protect ourselves against.”
Mina acknowledged that the vaccines has proven very effective against preventing the most severe symptoms of Covid-19.
“If you’re fully vaccinated, it’s very, very, very unlikely that you will get a severe disease, even if you get exposed and infected with this virus,” Mina said.
Even with widespread vaccinations, Mina sees easily accessible and cheap rapid tests as one of the most important measures that should also continue to be developed to prevent community spread.
“We have still not gotten around to realizing that testing in a pandemic is for public health, not medicine, and we should not be charging anyone, frankly, for using a PCR test,” Mina said.

Stephen E. Sachs ’02 — a prominent legal scholar of constitutional law, civil procedure, and conflict of laws — will become Harvard Law School’s inaugural Antonin Scalia Professor of Law as of July 1, the Law School announced Wednesday.
Currently serving as Duke Law School’s Colin W. Brown Professor of Law, Sachs researches a wide gamut of legal issues including federal jurisdiction, constitutional interpretation, and the function of common law in the national legal system.
Sachs wrote he was “honored” to be the first to hold the professorship in an emailed statement, and described Justice Scalia — a graduate of the Law School — as having an “extraordinary influence on the law” during his decades-long tenure as a Supreme Court justice.
“More than anyone else in recent history, he helped to refocus lawyers’ and judges’ attention on the text of the original Constitution and of federal statutes,” Saches wrote. “He was a sharp thinker and an exemplary writer, and his dissents were no less important than his majority opinions.”
In 2017, the Law School established the Antonin Scalia Professorship, endowed by the Considine Family Foundation, shortly after the Supreme Court Justice’s death the previous year.
Scalia’s family announced in March 2017 that it would donate Scalia's papers — judicial writings from the beginning of his legal career to the United States Supreme Court — to the Harvard Law School Library.
In 2020, Sachs was awarded the Federalist Society’s Joseph Story Award, a distinction which is bestowed annually upon a promising young legal scholar who demonstrates a commitment to teaching, students, and the law’s impact on society.
Sachs is a graduate of Harvard College, where he lived in Quincy House and received his A.B. in History, graduating summa cum laude. He wrote in an email that he fondly remembers taking Harvard Law School Professor Charles Donahue’s course — cross-listed in both the College and Law School — on the constitutional and legal history of Medieval England his senior year.
“It was slightly intimidating to be an undergrad outnumbered by upper-level law students, but it was one of the best classroom experiences of my college career,” Sachs wrote.
Returning to the University’s campus, revisiting old memories, and meeting new friends are just some of the activities Sachs said he is anticipating during his time as a Law School faculty member.
“I’m most looking forward to revisiting old haunts, taking my kids on walks through the Yard, enjoying conversations with my future colleagues and classes with my future students — and to having the right to be in Langdell even during final exams,” Sachs wrote.

Two Harvard College juniors were awarded the prestigious Truman scholarship — a distinction earned by only 62 budding public servants from 51 universities nationwide — according to a press release from last week.
Araoluwa P. Omotowa ’22 and Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22 were selected for their “outstanding leadership potential” and their record of public service. The scholarship entitles them to up to $30,000 in funding for post-graduate studies as well as special opportunities for government employment, per the scholarship’s website.
Omotowa said her experience as a Black African woman growing up in the predominantly white state of Idaho was one crucial factor that motivated her journey into public service.
She and Halima Hamud — another Black African woman — were the only two Truman Scholars from Idaho. Omotowa said after feeling “rejected” by a predominantly white state growing up, it is vindicating that she and Hamud are representing “what it means to be a leader in public service.”
“Out of everything, that's the most poetic when it comes to the justice of feeling very rejected by this place,” Omotowa said. “A lot of my essay and a lot of my description of my journey of public service originated from this sense of feeling like my own placement didn't matter.”
As the former political action chair of the Association for Black Harvard Women and as the second-ever director of diversity and outreach for the Institute of Politics, Omotowa has led efforts to initiate institutional change and promote diversity.
Omotowa said the research she is conducting with Radcliffe Institute fellow Ibram X. Kendi has also been formative in her effort to expose how “racism was institutionalized through U.S. policy, and historically ingrained into our society.”
Long term, Omotowa said she plans to pursue both a law degree and a masters in public policy, so she can first practice law and then help make it herself — all toward the end of deconstructing inequality.
“That’s the general direction, but the exact means of ‘I’m going to do that’ I still don’t know yet,” she said. “And I think that’s what’s most beautiful: the Truman lets you be open to defining that for yourself.”
Harris, who hails from Hattiesburg, Miss., said he believes one of the reasons he was a serious candidate for the Truman scholarship is because his hometown’s culture is centered around helping others.
“There's a real culture of just giving until you really just have nothing left to give and being able to derive purpose in your life from the ability to help other people,” Harris said.
Harris said he credits his family with “steering me in the right direction” and pushing him to use his voice to help others. He also said his mentor, the first Black mayor of Hattiesburg, Johnny DuPree, played a role in setting an example for Harris.
“Johnny DuPree, he was mayor right before I was born, but he also went to our church for the longest time and still goes there, and we're great family friends,” Harris said.
With DuPree in the mayor’s role, Harris said he never had “to go a day in my life without seeing somebody who looks like me in a position of public service and a position of leadership serving the community.”
Harris said he applied to the scholarship in part because he intends to attend law school and to advocate for criminal justice reform and voting rights.
“I really want to work on the issues and just try to remove barriers for the people who have been held back systemically, specifically pertaining to voting rights,” Harris said. “With particular to the criminal justice system, I definitely want to make it more difficult for prosecutors and district attorneys to strike black jurors from juries at a disproportionate rate.”
Harris said he believes his work with the Undergraduate Council, of which he is president, “helped a good bit” in securing him the Truman Scholarship.
“I think that's a major leadership position where we have a lot of resources to be able to effect change on a platform to do so,” Harris said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven escapees of North Korea participated in a panel discussion at the Kennedy School Tuesday to discuss human rights violations in North Korea and their efforts to bring more freedoms to the people there.
Jieun Baek, a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, moderated the event, which was hosted by the Belfer Center and the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
Baek, whose grandfathers were refugees from North Korea, said in an interview before the event that one of its purposes was to redefine who is considered an expert on North Korea.
“It’s not to say that policymakers and academics are not experts — of course they are. But I think that the true experts on the subject are the North Korean people themselves, who have the lived experience and have defected,” she said. “And unfortunately, it’s way too uncommon that North Korean defectors are not invited to speak on these issues.”
The event began with Baek laying out the extensive human rights violations commited by the North Korean regime, including running prison camps where atrocities such as extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, and rape occur.
She also spoke about North Korea's laws, which forbid citizens from consuming any information or media that is not permitted by the state and make leaving the country without permission punishable by death.
She said the event would take a different approach to human rights violations in North Korea than is generally taken.
“The problem definition today or to date has generally been a variation of how to get the regime to better protect the rights of its people,” she said. “Today, we will redefine that problem by asking how could we, civil society and the global community, improve the rights of North Korean people in both the short term and the long term.”
Seo-Hyun Lee, a graduate student who escaped from North Korea in 2014, outlined two main tools the regime uses to facilitate human rights violations: suppression of speech and travel and guilt by association.
“In North Korea, every single person is subject to guilt by association,” she said. “This means your parents, spouse, siblings, children, even grandchildren, basically all your loved ones can be punished because of your actions.”
Human rights activist Yeon-Mi Park spoke about the process of escaping from North Korea as a child. First, she said, there are physical barriers, like fences, guards, and even landmines.
Once past the physical barriers and in China, escapees face a host of other threats, including repatriation by China back to North Korea.
“The Chinese Communist Party right now does not accept North Koreans as refugees. They view us as economic migrants,” Park said. “China does not have a right to send us back to our homeland, because we are going to be persecuted when we [are sent] back.”
She said that North Korean women also face the threat of being human trafficked and sold as sex slaves once in China, as she herself experienced.
“This is completely forgotten from the mainstream because so many countries have an interest in [the] Chinese government, and nobody wants to challenge the status quo,” she said. “So I think we are just completely forgotten — even though my mother and I were both sold for $300 in 2007.”

Amina T. Salahou, a prospective Harvard freshman from Syracuse, N.Y., said her “favorite” part of Virtual Visitas was touring Annenberg Hall over Zoom.
“I’m still not over the waffles that they showed, which have the Harvard logo. That was super cool,” she said. “Obviously, you know, the club [events] are super important but dining at Harvard? That was definitely the best one I went to.”
Virtual Visitas, the College’s online version of its welcome weekend for prospective students, began on Saturday, drawing largely positive responses from both student attendees of events and organizations hosting panels for the Class of 2025. Visitas events are scheduled to conclude at the end of this week.
This year’s Virtual Visitas marks the second time the College will welcome an incoming freshman class remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Salahou said she believes this year's Visitas is “super accessible” due to its online format.
“Realistically, if it was in person, if there’s one [event] at 3:00 and one at 4:00, you probably couldn’t make it in time or commute to the area — wherever it is — but it being virtual, again, it’s just super accessible,” she said.
Salahou said she attended information sessions for clubs including the Harvard Undergraduate Law Review and the Nigerian Students Association.
“I just thought that was super cool they had so many different identity-based groups, I know usually it’s kind of generalized,” she said.
Some students lamented the online format of Virtual Visitas but said they nevertheless enjoyed their experiences.
“Obviously would’ve rather had it in person, but circumstances didn’t allow that,” prospective student Carter G. Demaray said. “And I think the Visitas program really rose to the occasion.”
Demaray said he was “a lot more sure” of committing to Harvard after attending the online welcome.
“I’ve had a lot of my questions answered, and so I feel it’s been an overall positive experience,” Demaray said.
“In the beginning, I was a little apprehensive,” Priyanka Kaul, another admitted student, said. “Being virtual and everything, I didn’t know what to expect. I was honestly really looking forward to Visitas being in person.”
Kaul said she had “a pretty good experience” despite the online format.
Student organizations hosting panels during Virtual Visitas said they worked to provide an engaging experience for students online.
Sabrina P. Goldfischer ’23, the communications director at the Institute of Politics, wrote in email that the IOP was “considering how we could give the Class of 2025 our warmest welcome.”
“We also turned to social media engagement to provide an alternative way for students to learn more about IOP programming,” she wrote. “Throughout the week of Visitas, we are releasing an IOP 101 series, short videos filmed by each member of our Executive Team that describe different facets of our work.”
The International Relations Council has hosted takeovers on Instagram and messaging prospective students on social media throughout Virtual Visitas.
“What gets people to be involved with things when it’s all digital is when you reach out to them one-on-one,” Alexander P. Glynn ’24, an IRC recruitment officer, said.
“Something that I love the most is Instagram takeovers where you can actually get to know someone,” Caroline A. Bukowski ’24, another recruitment officer for the IRC, said.
Danika Luo ’23, co-vice president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, said her organization has also been using Instagram takeovers to connect with incoming freshmen during Virtual Visitas.
“So every day, a different committee of our organization will answer questions on our Instagram story, and so far it’s been going really well,” Luo said.
Allison R. Chang ’23, a co-president of the Harvard College Undergraduate Research Association, said HCURA used online platforms like Zoom and Congregate to connect with students.
“It was interesting because Harvard didn’t organize a universal platform for everyone like they did last year with Remo, and I think many of the frosh actually appreciated that because it gave organizations the ability to use more familiar platforms like Zoom, for example,” she said.
Chang said Congregate provided a more “interactive” platform for the prospective freshmen.
“You have separate tables where we had different HCURA members staff those tables from different committees, so freshmen could choose their own table that they wanted to join,” Chang said. “We had some freshmen who stayed at tables for 30 minutes or more during the event so I think it was a great way for them to meet people.”
Shania D. Hurtado from Houston, T.X., who committed to Harvard in December, said she was “impressed” by the Virtual Visitas events.
“I think I definitely came into Visitas with doubts and concerns about different things like, ‘Is this going to be the right college for me? Am I going to fit in with the environment? With the community?’” she asked. “But I think this past week, I feel like all of my doubts have been reassured because I just feel like everyone that I spoke to in these webinars, they were all just so kind and so willing to give information and to talk through any questions.”

Two-thirds of non-tenure-track respondents to The Crimson’s annual faculty survey said they believe the Faculty of Arts and Sciences does not provide enough support to non-tenure-track faculty.
In addition, 31 percent of non-tenure-track faculty surveyed — which included lecturers, preceptors, professors of the practice, and visiting professors — said they were considering a job offer outside of Harvard. Of those with job offers, nearly 60 percent said they were considering taking the external offer.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,180 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, challenges they face as academics, and pressing issues on campus — including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 94-question survey obtained more than 300 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth installments of The Crimson’s 2021 faculty survey series explored faculty perspectives on tenure procedures, campus divestment movements, the climate and culture of the FAS, Harvard’s response to Covid-19, and University and FAS governance, respectively. This final installment examines how faculty view FAS policies surrounding non-tenure-track faculty.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton and FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment for this story.
Of all respondents to the survey, including tenured and tenure-track professors, just under half reported that they believe the FAS does not provide enough support for non-tenure-track faculty. However, faculty differed significantly on this view depending on their ladder status.
While only 35 percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty said their non-ladder faculty colleagues lacked support from the FAS, 67 percent of non-tenure-track faculty said they were missing FAS support.
Survey respondents were also invited to share what aspects of their department or division’s culture they believe need to change. Common responses from non-tenure-track faculty included a lack of respect for teaching in comparison to research, poor treatment of non-ladder faculty, and an uneven burden of teaching and mentoring responsibilities placed on junior faculty. Several respondents also called for the elimination of the time caps on non-ladder faculty appointments.
The FAS hires most non-tenure-track faculty — notably including preceptors and lecturers — with a firm “time cap” of up to eight years. After this period elapses, the faculty member cannot again teach in a nontenured position at Harvard, regardless of their performance.
Expository Writing preceptor Margaret R. Doherty said many non-tenure-track faculty play “really central roles” at Harvard, especially with regard to teaching.
“When you have non-tenure-track faculty who have been here for a long time, who are not looking to leave or fielding other job offers, I think that gives you a sense of how essential these faculty members become to the University, particularly to undergraduate teaching,” Doherty said.
“When you’re teaching and working with this shadow of eventual layoff hovering over you the entire time, it is really hard to feel respected,” Doherty added. “It is really a kind of burden upon you to know that you’re always on your way out in some way.”
Thirty-one percent of non-ladder faculty respondents said they were either somewhat strongly, strongly, or very strongly considering a job offer outside Harvard. Among those with offers, 58 percent of non-tenure-track faculty respondents said they are somewhat, strongly, or very strongly considering taking them. In contrast, only 32 percent of ladder faculty with external offers indicated the same.
Sara M. Feldman, a preceptor in Yiddish, said she believes that Harvard’s characterization of its non-ladder faculty positions as “a stepping stone” to tenure-track positions or teaching positions at other institutions is inaccurate. She pointed out that the FAS does not provide research support for non-ladder faculty; a committee reviewing the FAS’s preceptor system reaffirmed that preceptors are exclusively hired for teaching, not research.
Of the non-tenure-track respondents, 70 percent said they see undergraduate teaching as their primary role as a faculty member. Just seven percent said their position prioritizes research.
“I think, in some ways, a person could leave Harvard less desirable for another job than when they arrived, in terms of how much they’ve been publishing in the last year or two,” Feldman said.
Fifty-nine percent of non-ladder faculty said they believe their compensation is too low, compared to 29 percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty who said the same.
Doherty said she believes such findings indicate that “there just isn’t enough investment on the part of the administration for teaching, advising, mentoring, all of the things that are central to student life at Harvard.”
“Our benefits are significantly less than the benefits allotted to our tenure-track colleagues, and they’re certainly not enough for most people I know who are trying to support a family or plan for the future,” Doherty said.
For its 2021 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 26 to Mar. 5, 2021. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in February 2021 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 315 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 309 participants answered at least one question, while 235 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 38 percent identified themselves as women and 19 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2020 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 32 percent and 25 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. Similarly, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 106 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 6 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

Though most students, faculty, and staff do not yet have access to Harvard’s new Science and Engineering Complex due to Covid-19 restrictions, The Crimson was granted access to tour the eight-story SEC Monday, guided by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences spokesperson Paul Karoff.
Situated across more than five acres with a maximum occupancy of around 2,000 people, the SEC plans for a full opening to students in fall 2021. Construction for the complex started more than five years ago and cost roughly $1 billion to complete. Faculty at SEAS started their move into the new building in Allston in November 2020, but most have yet to unpack their belongings.
Here is a brief look, in photos, of the SEC’s features, study spaces, and classrooms students can look forward to.
The SEC — which is roughly the length of a block in New York City — has two atria, the larger of which goes six stories up and two stories down. In a February interview, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said the building was designed with “serendipitous collisions” in mind, evidenced by the crisscrossing passageways and lines of sight across the building.
Karoff said the atria were designed to be a “vertical version” of Harvard Yard, where one can spot classmates up and down the SEC’s eight floors from many vantage points.
The building is marked by huge glass windows and porthole-esque skylights that naturally brighten the SEC during the day. The SEC is covered by a permanent exoskeleton designed to both keep the building cool in the summer and retain heat in colder months.
With two retractable projector screens, the main atrium can also serve as an event space.
The building contains four large lecture halls — 300-person, 100-person, 70-person, and 50-person rooms — all with a new car smell. The largest of which has its own audiovisual control room. Each lecture hall has “state-of-the-art” instructional technology along with traditional chalkboards, a faculty favorite, according to Karoff.
Many classrooms are also equipped with walls made of privacy glass, which can turn opaque using a toggle switch on the wall.
In an email, Karoff described seven of the classrooms as “flat” and “flexible,” with movable tables and chairs, the largest of which can hold up to 96 students. The SEC also holds six 24-person seminar rooms.
While the building will mostly house engineering students, Karoff noted SEAS has only allocated around 50 percent of classroom space in the hope that faculty and students in other Faculty of Arts and Sciences divisions and other schools will use additional spaces in the building, especially as shuttle bus services expand.
The complex contains a servery which will be open to students on the meal plan, in addition to kitchenettes spread throughout the building.
The second floor will also feature an engineering library, which will hold some physical collections, to join the greater Harvard Library system.
Floors four to six above ground will primarily hold faculty and staff offices, while the bottom two floors will hold more student-centered spaces.
The complex also has several outdoor patios and greenspace terraces that overlook Allston, Harvard Stadium, and the distant Boston skyline.
The main floor features a reimagined Active Learning Labs, a student makerspace originally in Pierce Hall, outfitted with new machines and tools. The center of the bottom floor serves as a dedicated study lounge for undergraduates.
Adjacent to the bottom floor lobby is a “clubhouse,” Karoff said, or a makerspace dedicated entirely for student clubs and their engineering-related projects. The only other dedicated space on campus for undergraduate clubs is the Student Organization Center at Hilles, abbreviated as the SOCH, near the Quad houses in Cambridge.
The walls of the SEC hold art commissioned for the space, most noticeably “Harvard Time Capsule,” designed by BREAKFAST, a Brooklyn-based artist collective. BREAKFAST constructed the piece using original “Flip-Discs” — electromagnets serving as mechanical pixels that rotate from one side to another — to capture portions of thousands of interactions between passersby that will replay on the wall across the years.
Karoff said SEAS will soon install an exhibit of faculty research, a timeline wall of SEAS history, and the massive 1944 Mark I computer originally housed in the Science Center.
Karoff said the Engineering Yard — the greenspace in front of the south entrance of the SEC — is designated to function as both an outdoor study space and amphitheater.
He added that saplings derived from the historic beech trees that have long grown outside of Pierce Hall — the original home of SEAS — will be planted in the Engineering Yard. In addition, rubbled concrete slabs from the historical scrapyard the SEC site was built upon have been repurposed as some outdoor benches, according to Karoff.
Though some students will have limited lab access to the building over the summer, Karoff emphasized that the goal for students to officially enter the complex is fall 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A statewide organization hosted a town hall on Thursday in support of two bills in the Massachusetts House to reform Payment in Lieu of Taxes programs.
Massachusetts Action for PILOT, a coalition of local advocacy groups focused on reforming PILOT, invited elected officials and residents to discuss H. 3080 and H.D. 2068, the two bills intended to reform PILOT.
Inspired by Boston’s current program, H. 3080 would create a local option for municipalities to adopt and enforce PILOT payments in which privately held non-profits with more than $15 million in land — such as Harvard — would be required to contribute 25 percent of the property taxes they are currently exempt from.
The bill, which has already accumulated 14 co-sponsors, has been referred to the Joint Committee on Revenue.
Though cities like Boston and Cambridge already have PILOT programs in place, they lack the mechanisms to enforce them. Harvard, for example, has failed to meet its payments for nine consecutive years, paying only 79 percent of Boston’s $13 million request last year. H. 3080 would allow Boston and Cambridge to make these payments mandatory.
State Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven said at the town hall that making these payments mandatory would ease the tax burden on homeowners, especially in light of the economic strain brought on by Covid-19.
“A lot of our residents as well as small businesses are subsidizing these very large institutions,” Uyterhoeven said. “This is something that will materially impact our municipal budgets and how we're able to have equitable budgets and equitable recovery.”
Uyterhoeven said revenue from PILOT is used to support crucial city services, such as snow removal, sewage, and emergency services.
H.D. 2068, the “sister bill” to 3080, would require municipalities to conduct assessments every five years on the amount of revenue lost on tax-exempt property valued at over $1 million, such as that covered by PILOT agreements.
“Just trying to get some of those assessments to happen regularly can be really difficult,” State Rep. Maria D. Robinson, the bill’s sponsor, said. “Frankly, when I asked for this information for the last time it was done from the Department of Revenue, they did not have it in electronic form because it was so long ago, and it only came in paper form.”
“This is something that's desperately needed if we're going to take this fight on,” she added.
In an interview following the event, Enid Eckstein, an organizer for Massachusetts Action for PILOT and one of the town hall’s moderators, described both bills as a “collaborative effort” between the Representatives, local groups, and the statewide organization.
Eckstein said one of the organization’s most important milestones, spearheaded by Boston City Councilor Kenzie Bok, was convincing the City of Boston to commit to revaluation of PILOT property estimates. The current estimates are still based on valuations taken during 2009, at the height of the Great Recession.
“Property values were very deflated,” Eckstein said. “Everybody knows property in Boston is quite valuable at this point, so we really pushed hard on revaluation, and that was agreed to this summer.”
According to Eckstein, the organization also hopes to redefine PILOT’s community benefits clause through “the lens of racial justice.” This clause currently allows participants to contribute 50 percent of requested payments through services provided to residents.
“Real community benefits are not something that are kind of dreamed up in a university committee's office,” Bok said during the town hall. “They're about results for the most critical issues that our community faces.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke referenced previous comments about PILOT community benefits in an emailed statement.
“As a nonprofit, Harvard engages with both Boston and Cambridge in a variety of important ways, including participating in both cities’ PILOT programs, paying municipal taxes on the University’s non-exempt property, as well as through meaningful, and — increasingly more critical — community programs, initiatives and outreach,” O’Rourke wrote.
Bok said that while significant improvements are still needed so that PILOT can meet the needs of cities like Boston, she is optimistic.
“To me, the most promising thing is that in COVID, we've seen the universities work collaboratively with the city to address real metrics,” Bok said. “I think that if we treat the racial and economic injustice crises in our city the way that we've treated COVID and kind of learn from that moment, we have a real opportunity.”

Love It: Fake it till you make it — Tina Chen
Zoom convenience has really hit these days, especially when I can roll out of bed 5 minutes before class, or even attend lectures from the comfort of my bed. But thanks to a magical combination of Zoom’s “touch up my appearance” feature and a specially selected virtual background, I can at least pretend that my life is not that big of a mess. There’s no need to worry that someone will see the state of my blanket and piece together that I had just woken up. All there is to be concerned about is that pset due in 24 hours that I have yet to even look at…
Let’s face it, ever since the pandemic started, we’ve all developed our coping mechanisms, from spending hours making whipped coffee to developing a plant collection. Now that we’re back on a school schedule, Zoom backgrounds have added some much needed spice to the mundane routine of online classes. Sure, you can show off your room in your Zoom call, but you can also pretend you’re on a tropical island with the wind blowing through your hair. You decide which is better. They also have potential to be great conversation starters, whether it be a classmate or even your professor inquiring about your video background of yourself walking past the camera. Best of all, the possibilities are endless! Check out some of Flyby’s suggestions for best Zoom backgrounds for your next class!
Hate It: You lost me at “virtual” — Matylda A. Urbaniak
As much as I love attending class from the comfort of my dorm (Goodbye, running across the Yard in the cold!) it’s true that it’s much harder to learn about… the boa programming language? The cobra language? The snake language? (Wait, no, it’s definitely not a finance thing…) In CS50 than it normally would be. Who can resist the allure of scrolling through TikTok, or even better, Flyby, all day? Enter the Zoom camera feature: now you can see all of your classmates, just like in real school! But wait! Why is your professor’s head coming off of his body? Why is your screen being assaulted with a gif of Among Us spacemen behind someone at 9 am???? The ugly truth is that Zoom backgrounds leave you even more confuzzled than after taking your midterm (if your midterm wasn’t canceled under mysterious circumstances and replaced by a problem set, that is), and who needs that?
Also, in a semester where we’ve all been looking for excuses to slide into the zoom DMs of the cutie in our section, what better way to ~subtly~ make yourself seem really cool? Did your crush just mention that they want to go to Mexico? Boom, put a physical Mexican flag on your wall! Not only will they think that you’re cool, they’ll probably also slide into your DMs (or so I’ve been told. If the kid from my Math 1b section is reading this, help me out here! Dinner by the river on Friday, babe?) Overhear them say something about Avatar in your breakout room? Get a poster of those funky blue people in your background! They were definitely referring to that movie, right? Nobody will call you out for making a fool out of yourself, and you just might catch the eye of that special someone. Or, you know, you could just talk to them, but not all of us are that heroic.

It’s been nearly two whole weeks since Taylor Swift released her re-recorded album, Fearless (Taylor’s Version), which means Swifties everywhere are bored out of their minds. To help with that, Flyby has created the only vibe chart you need. Who cares about which House you’re in when you could be a Taylor Swift album instead? Baby, just say yes! ...to our picks ;)
