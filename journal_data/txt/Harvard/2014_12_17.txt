After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released the executive summary of its report on the Central Intelligence Agency’s detention and intelligence programs and a rebuttal written by the Republican members of the committee. The 524-page summary—the only portion of the much larger and longer study on the same topic that has been declassified—represented a scathing indictment of the CIA and the tactics it following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.
The grisly details of the report should give all Americans pause: It is clear from the report that the torture program run by the CIA was morally and legally wrong, ineffective, and unsuccessful in providing intelligence. As a nation, we cannot compromise our values—even in the midst of the fight against terrorism, and even when such a concession seems temptingly expedient.
Despite some attempts to defend the CIA’s techniques, there can be no doubt that the agency engaged in morally dubious acts as a means of extracting information. In some cases, prisoners were subjected to waterboarding, rectal feeding, or intentional sleep deprivation. Other prisoners were buried alive or handcuffed by the wrists to overhead bars for hours. Though lawyers from the Justice Department had previously approved some of these techniques (in direct contrast with the stated positions of the United Nations and the European Court of Human Rights), CIA personnel also utilized various other, unapproved methods. In addition, the report calls into question the competency and training of many of the interrogators. Both the interrogation techniques and the interrogators themselves were inappropriately chosen and crossed a moral line; the actions of the program were inexcusable and a betrayal of this nation’s principles.
Moreover, the willingness of the CIA to mislead Congress about the effectiveness of its interrogation program is deeply troublesome. Members of the CIA had previously testified about the efficacy of enhanced interrogation techniques in obtaining valuable information from prisoners, but the report casts doubts on these testimonies and suggests exactly the opposite—that these techniques were instead detrimental to the overall interrogation program. The CIA’s attempts to conceal the truth and to prevent Congressional oversight of its actions only serve to further exacerbate our worries.
This editorial is not intended to be a condemnation of the CIA as a whole; rather, it is a rebuke of one of its programs at a particular and peculiar juncture in time. Many projects and programs overseen by the CIA and other American intelligence agencies are doubtlessly essential to the welfare and security of the United States.
It is also important to acknowledge, however, that the unveiling of this report was a necessary step in holding the CIA accountable for the unacceptable actions that have pervaded its detention program, and as a means of providing a warning for the future. In fact, if there is more information in the 6000 pages of the report which could further inform policy and better our picture of what happened, it ought to be released as well.
This country must remain vigilant, even in times of war, toward the activities of our intelligence agencies. Our ideals and our values are part of what those agencies seek to defend; they should not be compromised in the process of defense. This must not happen again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a little more than a month since the 2014 midterm elections that saw overwhelming Republican victories, we have had time to see one sad trend of American politics continued unabatedly. The disturbing trend is the continuing role of outside expenditures in federal elections—over $794 million across all the House and Senate races in 2014.
The pernicious effects of a dependence upon outside donors on the democratic process cannot be ignored. Politicians have come to rely heavily on financial contributions from people who are not their constituents, undermining the representative ideals of the Constitution.
But this issue is not just confined to federal offices—increasingly, state offices are up for sale too. Especially disturbing is the influence of external expenditures on sensitive offices like state attorney general or state judge, where impartiality is especially expected.
Although Massachusetts does not publicly elect its justices, 38 states undergo a statewide election to determine its judges. Across the country, there have been cases of highly partisan campaigns over court seats. According to Justice at Stake, a national organization that seeks to keep courts fair and impartial, outside groups spent around $4.9 million in TV advertisement attempting to influence Supreme Court races. The Republican State Leadership Committee pours a remarkable amount of money into these races; they spent $720,000 to purchase numerous TV ad buys in Montana and Illinois and contributed over $1.4 million to local groups in Tennessee and North Carolina, all in 2014.
Alicia Bannon, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, condemns how justices now “campaign and fundraise like politicians,” and that the solution is to introduce “public financing so judges don’t have to rely on special interests to get elected.”
Even more upsetting is the growing friendship between various state attorneys general and outside corporations. The New York Times recently reported on the cozy relationship between energy companies and a dozen attorneys general, cemented with over $16 million in campaign contributions this year alone. In fact, an investigation by the Times discovered that “individual attorneys general have shut down investigations, changed policies or agreed to more corporate-friendly settlement terms after intervention by lobbyists and lawyers, many of whom are also campaign benefactors.”
Suffice it to say that these elected individuals do not appear to have their constituents in mind.
Corporations are targeting these races because of the potentially tremendous financial gains that come with the assistance of attorneys general.
With the ability to sway consumer protection regulation and anti-trust law within a state, attorneys general have become a massive target for outside influence. For example, in the Nevada election between Adam Laxalt and incumbent Ross Miller, a Virginia non-profit, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, bought a $500,000 ad campaign to support Laxalt and his “free market principles.” Unfortunately, in a post-Citizens United world, this particular scenario is becoming the norm, not the exception.
We are fed up with this system of political corruption. We’re Harvard College Democracy Matters, a chapter of a national non-partisan student organization that is building a broad student movement to get big private money out of politics and people back in. Although the United States needs a plethora of intelligent policies to restore its democracy, the first step requires pressuring elected officials to acknowledge the existence of the problem and pledge to fix it. For this reason, Democracy Matters created the Democracy Pledge.
It reads: “I support restoring Democracy by publicly financing elections and taking big money out of politics.” So far almost 1000 students have signed the pledge in the New England area, which inspired Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Mark Takano ’83 of California to sign on as well.
Money in politics is not a Democratic or a Republican issue; it’s an issue that applies to all of us and all the issues we care about. We need to tackle this issue in order to improve governance and pass meaningful reform on any number of issues, from immigration to climate change, gun violence to the tax and regulatory codes. We hope you join us by getting involved in our Democracy Matters chapter and signing the pledge. We still have a chance to restore democracy in America, but we need to take it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 16, 2014, at 9:53 p.m.
For my first job out of law school, I worked at a nonprofit in South Africa. My first client was a woman who had been gang-raped and beaten up by five men. When she went to her local clinic, she discovered that she could not receive the antiretroviral medicine that might prevent her from contracting HIV because Thabo Mbeki, South Africa’s president at the time, and his government did not believe that HIV caused AIDS. It was a traumatic and difficult case, and we lost over and over before we finally won in court and forced the government to change its dangerous policies. The specifics of her case were revolting, and the government’s response to her plight was heartbreaking. And yet every day I went to work and pressed forward. I did this not because I was superhuman or somehow unfeeling, but because I was a lawyer.
Now I read that Harvard Law students are demanding an extension on their exams because the trauma of recent events in Ferguson and Staten Island has made it impossible for them to focus on their studies. I am not sympathetic.
Setting aside the rather ridiculous notion that these instances somehow constituted a massive loss of innocence (you’re at one of the elite centers of legal education in the world and you didn’t know racial injustice existed in America?), Harvard Law must see its principal mission as training future lawyers for the rigors of practicing law. Lawyers need to be advocates who fight relentlessly for their clients’ interests, who are capable of working under pressure on often emotionally charged cases on behalf of clients whose lives and livelihoods depend on their ability to do so. If you cannot handle these sorts of pressures, you’re not ready for life as a lawyer.
This is doubly true for those who wish to dedicate some or all of their careers to civil rights advocacy. I recently spoke with Cary Hansel, a partner at Joseph Greenwald & Laake who has handled civil rights cases for the last 15 years. He told me directly that he would never hire anyone who felt the need to delay exams because of Ferguson-related trauma. He wrote to me (and later repeated in part in a blog post), “If you are rendered so helpless by media reports of injustice from afar that you cannot even take a make-believe school test, you are not prepared to handle the real pain experienced by victims in the up-close-and-personal way that is necessary to bring them—and our country—justice. The tests you are shirking are a sad fantasy approximation of what lawyers do—with no one's life hanging in the balance, and without any real repercussions for the quantum of justice in the world.”
The Harvard Law School faculty and administration must reject the demand for exam extensions. As a black man who desperately wants dedicated, intelligent, and well-trained lawyers to fight the good fight for justice, I fear that by following in the footsteps of Georgetown University Law Center and Columbia University School of Law, HLS will be doing a grave disservice to the school’s commitment to producing effective and vigorous advocates. We need people made of sterner stuff.
This is a tough profession, and in the fight for justice mollycoddles and sunshine soldiers are not needed. To those law students who feel the need to take a timeout, I offer a sincere bit of advice: If this decision incapacitates you so profoundly that your mind cannot write intelligently about torts or contract law, then my suggestion is that you have found yourself in the wrong field. Sell insurance, develop an app, open a florist shop, become a barber or a bartender, but do not put yourself out there as a man or woman capable of standing up for clients and fighting for them. If you don’t have the steel for this fight, you don’t have the chops to be a good lawyer. It really is that simple.
This is a serious time for serious people. If Harvard Law Students will not take their educations seriously, then the faculty must make them do so. Either way, they simply must take their exams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 17, 2014, at 2:12 a.m.
Following student group complaints and internal discussions, Harvard University Dining Services has decided to suspend purchases of appliances from a company involved in an international settlement dispute.
Until last April, HUDS had been purchasing water machines from a company recently acquired by SodaStream, an Israeli company that specializes in do-it-yourself soda and water machines. Sodastream’s main factory is located on the West Bank, a settlement at the heart of conflicts between Israel and Palestine regarding land ownership in the area. The company, which announced in October that it will move its factory to southern Israel, has drawn criticism and boycotts for its location in disputed territory.
Last fall, some members of the College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society noticed that the filtered water machines in certain dining halls had Sodastream labels on them. Citing discomfort with the machines and the potential of the machines to offend those affected by the Israel-Palestine conflict, the students emailed House masters and tutors to arrange a meeting with University officials to have the machines removed.
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, a member of the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance who attended some of the subsequent meetings, said that she believed that regardless of the University’s position, the machines and their association with the disputed territory could be offensive to Palestinian students.
“I think it is neither anti-Israel nor anti-Semite to take stand against the occupation,” she said. “These machines can be seen as a microaggression to Palestinian students and their families and like the University doesn’t care about Palestinian human rights.” She added that her views should not be construed as the official club stance on the issue.
Members of the PSC, representatives from HUDS, Lowell House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, Mather House Co-Master Michael Rosengarten, and Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde convened to discuss the students’ complaints at a meeting on April 7 in Lowell House, according to a memo from the meeting shared with The Crimson.
Sandalow-Ash, who was present at the meeting, said that the discussion focused on the potential effects of the machines on the student body. While many students pushed for the removal of the machines, she said that at least one participant at the meeting argued that this move could be perceived as a University stance against Israel.
Following the discussions, HUDS agreed to remove SodaStream labels on current machines and purchase machines from other companies such as American firms EverPure and Crysalli in the future, according to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
Tez M. Clark '17, a member of the PSC, praised Harvard's choice to suspend purchases from SodaStream in an emailed statement.
"I hope that Harvard’s effort to hear the concerns of Palestinian students and make make a meaningful change in response to these concerns will inspire further support for and discussion on Palestinian rights, both on this campus and around the world," wrote Clark, who is also a Crimson editorial editor.
Sandalow-Ash said that though some of the protesting students had hoped for a formal statement from HUDS on the issue, they were satisfied by the ultimate outcome.
“HUDS was receptive,” she said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office will move from its location at 20 Garden Street to the fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center in March 2015, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke.
Burke said he hopes that the move, which has been in the works for more than three years, will facilitate registration and ease communication with other College offices. Currently, the floor houses the offices of the Program in General Education, the Advising Programs Office, and the Accessible Education Office.
The current Registrar’s Office on Garden St. is located about a quarter of a mile away from the Smith Campus Center.
“Very often students are going back and forth between our offices trying to get things solved for registration,” Burke said, noting that students often have to run between University Health Services in the Smith Campus Center and the Registrar’s Office in order to register with required vaccinations. “Now they can do it all in one building.”
Dean of administration and finance Sheila C. Thimba, who is overseeing construction and the move alongside the FAS Office of Physical Resources and Planning, agreed with Burke, saying that the move will bring the Registrar’s Office closer to complementary services, like the term bill office and UHS.
“The thinking behind it was that the regular office on 20 Garden Street is some distance from the heart of campus and is isolated from student services,” Thimba said. “Now it will be contiguous to other student services.”
The Registrar’s Office will occupy the space currently held by the APO, which plans to move down the hall closer to Gen Ed’s offices in March.
Construction on the fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center began a little over a month ago, leaving the west side of the floor completely gutted. According to Burke, the Registrar’s Office will be fully moved in after spring break.
The College offices will not be displaced during construction, and instead will only be shifted around, according to program administer for the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
“Everyone is here for the duration and will be here after, too. It’ll just be cozier,” Kenen wrote in an email.
Burke also said that the move will allow for a more “contemporary registrar’s office,” as compared to the current space which, with its four reception desks and room for filing cabinets, is “outfitted for the Registrar of a generation ago.”
Burke and Thimba said they do not know what will occupy 20 Garden Street space once the Registrar’s Office has vacated the site.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Wednesday, Dec. 10 wore on, University President Drew G. Faust was worried about how Harvard’s infamous Primal Scream tradition, a pre-exam naked lap around Harvard Yard scheduled for that night, would unfold.
“I was anxious about [Primal Scream] in advance, because we heard that there was going to be this merging of two very separate agendas, and I was afraid that people were going to end up in some kind of confrontation,” Faust said in her final sit-down interview of the year with The Crimson on Tuesday.
A group of about 30 students protesting the non-indictments of two white police officers who killed unarmed black men in Staten Island, NY. and Ferguson, Mo. tried to hold a moment of silence prior to the run, but most of the runners did not comply. Many left the event questioning the actions of the protesters, runners, and two dozen college administrators who kept the peace.
Harvard’s president, who did not attend Primal Scream, credited Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for ensuring that serious conflict did not materialize.
“I think Rakesh did a great job of deflecting people in an absolutely physical way, having people go different directions and not crash into each other,” Faust said on Tuesday.
The campus protests that have unfolded during the last month have stopped traffic and inspired heated discussions. And yet those demonstrations are just the latest chapter in a year of campus conversations about sexual assault, faculty dissent over changes to health benefits plans, significant turnover at the top rungs of Harvard’s leadership, and a University-wide fundraising drive.
WEIGHING IN
In the past, Faust has said that it is not within the president’s role to comment on public issues unrelated to Harvard’s mission. But as demonstrations on campus and around the country continued to increase in scale in recent weeks, the Harvard president and Civil War historian said she decided to make an exception.
“Black lives matter. It has taken far too long to make that fundamental truth a living, essential part of the fabric of our society, our government, and our lives,” Faust said in a statement on Dec. 9. “Martin Luther King, Jr. made clear a half century ago why we can’t wait. What was urgent then is imperative now.”
Speaking with The Crimson this week, Faust recalled, as she has before, her own freshman year at Bryn Mawr College in 1965, when she skipped her spring term midterms and drove to Selma, Ala. to join voting rights demonstrations. That experience, she said, has come back to her again in the last month.
“I felt tremendous admiration for those who said ‘we must do something’ and ‘we must affirm that we care about justice and equality and opportunity, and we oppose racism and inequality and injustice,’” Faust said, referencing a speech by Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton. “And so I said something.”
Her four-sentence statement received some backlash from students, who expressed frustration at what they considered its short length compared to a more than 300-word statement on a planned “Black Mass” on campus last spring.
“I meant it to be a very powerful statement,” Faust said. “I think less can sometimes be more, something that is succinct and makes your point. If you go on and on, you sometimes weaken the force of it.”
‘RISE IN CONSCIOUSNESS’
In a year marked by increased campus and national attention on the issue of sexual assault, Faust established a task force focused on sexual assault prevention in April and oversaw the roll-out of a new University-wide policy that took effect this semester. Thus far, the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault has increased support for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and modified orientation materials. It is also set to conduct a survey to gauge the campus “climate,” the results of which will be compared to other higher education institutions this spring.
Those actions have not been made without criticism. In addition to undergraduate discontent that only two College students are members of the new task force and that the policy lacks an “affirmative consent” clause, 28 Law School professors condemned the policy in an open letter to the Boston Globe in October.
Despite these controversies, Faust remained optimistic about the steps the University has taken in the past year.
“As I think back on the calendar year, it seems that we made a lot of progress in this, partly because of the huge rise in consciousness and awareness about it,” Faust said. “We’ve made progress on both how to adjudicate issues and in how to try to work for prevention. There’s still lots more work to be done, obviously, but I feel that thanks to the hard work of an awful lot of people, we’ve made some good progress.”
CHANGING OF THE GUARD
Faust has also faced an unusually high rate of staff turnover this year, especially among Harvard’s top brass.
In June, Harvard Management Company CEO Jane L. Mendillo announced that she would depart by the end of the year. Though Mendillo had led HMC to double-digit investment returns in recent years, the endowment’s performance also lagged behind many of Harvard’s peers. Nevertheless, Faust said Mendillo’s exit caught her by surprise.
“I was very sad when Jane said she was going. She came in last spring and said, you know, she really felt that she had put the company in a new place and that she had done this long enough in her own view and wanted to move on,” Faust said on Tuesday. “I would have been very happy for her to stay on.”
In September, a search committee selected Stephen Blyth, a managing director and head of public markets at HMC as well as a professor of statistics, to succeed Mendillo.
“Stephen is a very competitive and ambitious guy,” Faust said. “He’s a cricket player. He likes to win, and I think he’s going to do a lot to really advance the best interests of the endowment and of Harvard.”
About a month after Blyth’s appointment, Faust lost another top official when Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray announced that she would leave her post by the end of the year. Earlier this month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced that Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 would succeed Murray on an interim basis.
Lewis came across, to some in University circles, as a surprising pick. The former dean of Harvard College from 1995-2003, Lewis has for years maintained a blog on which he has not been shy about criticizing University policies.
“It was really Dean Smith’s decision, and I think he regarded as Harry Lewis as someone who had dedicated his life to Harvard and had served the institution and SEAS very well,” Faust said this week.
“I don’t read the blog,” she added, when asked.
Faust has also been finding replacements for Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications Christine M. Heenan, University Chief Financial Officer Dan S. Shore, and Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez.
ON TO 2015
Even amid responding with these issues, Faust has seen her travel schedule grow considerably, with major alumni events in New York, Dallas, London, and Mexico as well as a host of other duties associated with Harvard’s capital campaign.
The travel has been tiring, Faust said, but worth it.
“The outreach is there, the continuing engagement that Harvard matters to people throughout their lifetime...all of that has been really thrilling for me to see,” she said. “The campaign has evoked it. The campaign has been the occasion for the expression of that kind of feeling.”
It has helped that the money has poured in. Since launching the public phase of the fundraising drive with $2.8 billion raised last fall, Harvard has brought in an additional $2 billion in gifts and pledges, including a $150 million gift and a $350 million gift, bringing the campaign’s total to $4.8 billion.
Faust said she approaches the holiday break without a firm New Year’s resolution, though she said she hopes to “stop catching so many colds.” She is, however, ready for some rare time off.
“This has been a very busy fall,” she said.

A lawsuit against the University alleging sexual abuse by a former Harvard swim coach four decades ago will be allowed to proceed in court, following a legal extension of the statute of limitations on child sex abuse cases in Massachusetts.
Stephen M. Embry, 57, who claims that he was sexually abused and photographed nude in the Harvard swimming pool by a University coach between 1969 and 1972, filed a lawsuit in June 2012 against the University to seek compensation. His case was dismissed by a court on the grounds of having exceeded the statute of limitations, which grants the victim three years to sue after having realized that he or she has been abused.
This June, however, Massachusetts lawmakers extended that period to seven years. Embry’s lawyer, Carmen L. Durso, had appealed the initial ruling in January. The new legislation was applied retroactively, prompting a judge in Middlesex Superior Court to rule that the case can go forward, according to Durso.
Embry claims that the University not only denied having any knowledge of such events, despite a similar lawsuit having been filed against the former assistant swimming coach, Benjamin Merritt, in 1996, but also that it misinformed Embry about the statute of limitations on such cases, which discouraged him from suing promptly. Embry first wrote Harvard about the alleged abuse in 2008.
Merritt committed suicide in 1996 after the first allegation against him was made.
Durso described Harvard’s attitude on the issue as “disappointing,” saying that even high schools that are notified about sexual abuse having occurred in the past do not adopt the “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” approach that he said the University has.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal stated in an email that "the acts that Mr. Embry says that he suffered at the hands of his neighbor can only be described as despicable, but there is no basis to suggest that the University had any knowledge of these events when they allegedly occurred more than three decades ago."

Author Glenn Kurtz shared the inspiration for his recent book, “Three Minutes in Poland: Discovering a Lost World in a 1938 Family Film,” with a crowd of about 40 people at the Harvard Book Store Monday evening.
Kurtz said he discovered a three-minute clip of Nasielsk, Poland in home video footage his grandparents captured while touring Europe during the summer of 1938. The video shows life in the predominantly Jewish village one year before it was invaded by Nazi forces.
In 2009, Kurtz began researching his grandparents’ trip, hoping to find out where the video was filmed. He said he spent two years trying to track down survivors and experts on Poland during the period immediately preceding the Holocaust.
Kurtz was able to contact seven survivors from Nasielsk and the families of many more. He and 50 people with ancestral ties to the community traveled to the town in October.
He said he was surprised by how the book and its plot evolved from his initial viewing of the footage.
“I began this project thinking that it was a story of loss, that what I was doing was documenting a community that had been destroyed…. But the surprising thing was that it brought together people who either remember the town personally, or [those] who traced ancestry to this town,” he said.
Kurtz spoke for about 40 minutes, showing clips from his grandparents’ movies and reading excerpts from the book. The author then answered questions from the audience and signed copies of his book.
Marcy Collins, the marketing coordinator for the Harvard Book Store who helped organize the talk, said the event was particularly exciting for her.
“I personally wanted to run [the event] because I’m Jewish, and anything that’s about Jewish history in some way, shape, or form is important to me on a personal level,” Collins said. “I like when Harvard Book Store does events around not just the Holocaust, obviously, but anything that has to do with Jewish history.”
Andrey Shlyakhter, an attendee who was born in the former Soviet Union and is currently working on his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, said he was impressed by Kurtz and his story.
“I think it’s really remarkable how you can turn a little clue into something bigger and something bigger and bigger, the way it sort of spools like a thread. I just think this way of doing history is really exciting,” he said.
Though Kurtz released the book in November, he said he hopes to do further research on Nasielsk and keep tabs on the survivors, many of whom are in their nineties, and their families for years to come.

Harvard Medical School instructor and Brigham and Women's Hospital physician Vivek H. Murthy ’98 was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Surgeon General on Monday, following a year-long delay due to heavy opposition from lawmakers who questioned his experience and his stance on gun control.
Though President Barack Obama nominated Murthy for the position in Nov. 2013, conservative members of Congress objected to his history of activism, including comments on Twitter in support of gun control and the co-founding of Doctors for America, an organization of American physicians and medical students supportive of Obama and his policies. After Democrats chose to delay the Senate confirmation vote past midterm elections in November, Murthy was confirmed in a 51-43 vote divided predominantly along party lines.
During his contentious confirmation, Murthy said that he plans to focus on relatively uncontroversial public health issues, including obesity, vaccinations, and mental health.
“I applaud the Senate for confirming Vivek Murthy to be our country’s next Surgeon General,” President Obama wrote in an official statement released Monday. “As ‘America’s Doctor,’ Vivek will hit the ground running to make sure every American has the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe.”
Joseph Loscalzo, a Medical School professor and chair of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Department of Medicine, applauded Murthy’s selection as Surgeon General.
“We are truly delighted that Vivek Murthy's nomination for Surgeon General has been confirmed by the Senate,” Loscalzo wrote in a statement. “He is a remarkably talented physician with a deep and abiding commitment to the health of the nation.”
Faculty at the Medical School also voiced support for Murthy.
“HMS physicians have a long history of health care leadership,” Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said. “Vivek Murthy’s confirmation reflects well on that history, and we look forward to his efforts to enhance the health of our population through his position as Surgeon General. ”
Murthy, 37, previously worked in health care policy as a member of the national Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health.  Murthy, who currently teaches classes at the Medical School and works as an attending physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, spoke at HMS Class Day in May 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year after Harvard undergraduate Eldo Kim emailed bomb threats that halted University activities during exam period, experts said they were skeptical that Kim could resume his studies at the College.
Kim’s lawyer, Allison D. Burroughs, wrote in an emailed statement last month that Kim hopes to return to Harvard, but he must face the Administrative Board to be readmitted. With no recent public historical precedent and strict confidentiality rules, it is unclear how exactly the College’s disciplinary arm will handle a mass bomb threat hoax.
Before appearing before the Ad Board, Kim must successfully complete a deferred prosecution agreement, under which he must participate in community service, pay restitution to law enforcement agencies who responded to the bomb threat, and make a public apology. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has said it will dismiss all charges if Kim completes the program over 18 months–a bargain law professionals have described as “extraordinary.”
Experts said that Kim’s defense team must have argued that his actions on Dec. 16 last year were an “incredible aberration” of character as a result of high emotional distress. Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, agreed that there must be “something very redeeming” about Kim, but speculated that the Ad Board may not be as lenient as the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“I will say that an emotional situation could be a mitigating factor in punishment, but that doesn’t mean it automatically deems forgiveness,” Lake said. “[Calling in a bomb threat] is not a choice most people will make under stress.”
Though Kim’s case is likely unique in recent history, the College Handbook for Students’ entry on threats involving explosives and bombs says that an incident in violation of Massachusetts law on the matter will be treated by the College as an “actionable offense.”
The Ad Board process is strictly confidential, meaning the Board’s membership and leaders are not authorized to comment on cases coming before them. According to its website, though, the Board embraces a pedagogic disciplinary approach.
“The College’s underlying premise is that, except in the rarest of circumstances, students involved in disciplinary cases ultimately will graduate from Harvard,” the site reads.
For Harvard officials, the definition of an unforgivable offense resulting in removal from the community has changed over time, according to Lake. Without a precedent in Kim’s case, Matthew Gregory, president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, said that Harvard will have to take a hard look at the extent to which situations involving high emotional distress are pardonable.
“I think ultimately you have to look at the behavior that was done, really separate the other compounding circumstances, and focus on the behavior in what campus policy says,” Gregory said. “If the behavior violated policies, you have to take action on it.”
Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge lawyer who has advised Harvard students facing Ad Board investigations since the late 1960s, said that he thinks the University should be more merciful toward Kim because his crime was not a “real threat.” He said he thought it is “unlikely” but “not out of the question” that the Ad Board will allow Kim to return.
“This student does not pose any concern about violence,” Silvergate said. “So, I think Harvard does not risk anything by letting him back.... I think there’s a chance they will.”
The University responded to the hoax as a serious threat—evacuating campus buildings, cancelling final exams, and calling in law enforcement officials, who conducted a six-hour sweep of the buildings. Lake said he thought the Ad Board could have concerns about students feeling safe if Kim returns to campus after a stunt that rattled many undergraduates in the midst of finals period.
“You’ve got to calculate not only the reality of safety but the perception of it,” Lake said. “You’d want Harvard students to not only be safe, but feel safe.”
If Kim is not welcome back to Harvard, experts said that he could also face difficulty gaining admission to another college because he would have to disclose the circumstances under which he left Harvard in any application.
Experts agreed that the decision will come down to what will be best for the stability and wellness of all Harvard affiliates.
“It all goes back to the same thing—the modern list of what’s unforgivable has changed," Lake said. “It really is a culture-specific decision about how you balance forgiveness and making statements about protecting your community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We do not lose like this.”
Then-co-captain Brandyn Curry had stood up in the locker room, turned to his teammates, and raised his voice.
“We are not going to lose this game like this.”
The Harvard men’s basketball team was on the biggest stage in college hoops—it was taking on perennial powerhouse Michigan State, whom both Los Vegas and the President had chosen to win the national championship, in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. And, at the half, it was losing. Badly.
So Curry took it upon himself to address his team at intermission. And everyone knows what happened next. Against the favorites, the Crimson began to climb back. Curry did his part, knocking down jumpers behind the three-point line, while then-junior Wesley Saunders and classmate Steve Moundou-Missi connected down low to bring the game within striking distance.
Then, with 7:12 remaining, co-captain Laurent Rivard did what he does best. He nailed a trey to give Harvard its first lead of the contest, 72-70.

At 6’4” and 185 pounds, Kjetil Borch was a long, lean, two-time defending champion of the single sculls at Head of the Charles. At 6’6” and 220 pounds, Mahe Drysdale already owned Olympic gold in the event. But neither were able to outrow 5’10”, 155-pound Andrew Campbell ’14.
Despite a collision with a goose that put him at a standstill, Campbell set a new course record on the Charles River—17:11.64 over the winding three-mile long distance—to win the championship singles at the 50th Head of the Charles Regatta this October.
And Campbell, a determined athlete who very narrowly missed the 2012 Olympics and has his sights set on Rio, did so on his hometown course, with thunderous support and noise coming from coaches, former teammates, and friends as he closed in on the home stretch past Weld Boathouse.

It had been a 9-0 season thus far—and it was only three minutes and 44 seconds away from 10-0 and an eighth straight win at The Game. But with the score knotted at 24-all and the Ivy League title in the balance, Harvard football needed a fix. Fast.
That’s when senior quarterback Conner Hempel found junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer sprinting down the right sideline. Hempel launched the ball into the air, and Fischer caught it in stride. Three strides later, Fischer was in the end zone.
Harvard was on top once more, now just seconds away from perfection as the crowd went wild at Harvard Stadium after a morning filled with tailgates, up and downs, and ESPN’s College GameDay.

While the first question about a sporting event may be about the final score, the locker room talk that inspired the comeback may have been just as important. While flashy plays and Cinderella stories are what show up in the sports page every morning and fill people’s Twitter feeds, the hustle play that gave the team the ball 30 seconds earlier may have been just as crucial to the team’s success.
Although sports are often presented as a matter of impressive—or not so impressive—statistics, sportswriting is about looking past the numbers, and into the narratives. Because ultimately, win or lose, the game is about the people—the players, coaches, and fans—involved.
The two of us have written about well over 150 different games combined, juggled the coverage of 42 varsity sports, and, in the past 12 months, edited close to 600 stories apiece.
But what stands out about our shared experience has been the intangibles—the emotion on the court, the passion of the beat writers, the electricity of the crowd on the field, in the stadium, or in the arena.
People at Harvard often complain about a lack of cohesion and disconnect among members of our community. They lambaste the dearth of open social spaces, and the hubris that taints many students.
It takes just one trip across the river (or to the MAC), however, and 40 minutes in Lavietes, or several hours in Harvard Stadium, or three periods at the Bright, to suddenly feel like a part of nearly four centuries of tradition and history.
One can easily feel lost at Harvard, but in the stands and sitting on press row, it’s hard not to be gripped by a sense of pride and belonging.
Our time as Sports Chairs has been shaped entirely by the people around us whose stories we try to tell every day. It’s the injured but headstrong team captain, the bench player who sinks a gamewinner, the coach who’s been here since before either of us were born, the hardworking photographer, and the managing editor who puts up with our antics every day.
Harvard’s about the people—so the next time you open the newspaper, look past the stats and remember that.
