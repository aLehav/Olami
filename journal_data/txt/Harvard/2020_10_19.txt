After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the fifth Monday of the semester — the last day for students to switch a course to pass-fail — has come and gone, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Educational Policy Committee is considering reopening the option to take a course pass-fail after the Undergraduate Council unanimously passed legislation calling for an extension of the deadline.
COVID-19 has killed more than 200,000 Americans and strained every aspect of college life. This is no normal term, and Harvard should embrace flexible policies like extending the option of pass-fail grading in acknowledgment of this, as peer institutions like MIT and Stanford University (among others) have done. We are still coming to terms with what an online, mid-pandemic, (mostly) off-campus semester looks like, and learning how to deal. Harvard should allow students to craft a course-load that best serves their needs as we navigate Zoom classes, studying while living in unexpected conditions and keeping ourselves mentally and physically well in the midst of a pandemic that has required us to radically restructure our lives.
Back in March, we opined in favor of the universal pass-fail policy the University ultimately adopted following the abrupt switch to online classes. Many of the concerns that led us to that decision are still factors now — health challenges, difficult home dynamics, time zone logistics, etc. — and increasing flexibility for students in this certainly chaotic, perhaps apocalyptic, time can only be a good thing.
Further, if the College believes — as we do — that how a course is graded should not affect how enriching the content is or how much a student can learn from it, there is no reason not to allow flexibility to switch between the grading systems.
But this begs a bigger question: if a switch to pass-fail does not affect the material we are taught, the assignments we complete, or the exams we take, then what is the purpose of letter-grading to begin with?
While the reasons a student might need to switch to pass-fail in fall 2020 are numerous, in a typical semester, we often opt for pass-fail grading in a course because we are scared of the grade we would get in it otherwise. As a school full of students who tend towards hyper-competitiveness, the omnipresent pressure to upkeep a near-perfect grade point average has a tremendous impact on how we structure our course loads.
Under the letter-grading system, anything that jeopardizes the objective of reaching and maintaining a high GPA must go. Our campus’s obsession with GPA does nothing to further learning, as we are incentivized to avoid courses that we anticipate will be a challenge or that are out of our comfort zone. This GPA arms race fuels Harvard’s unhealthily competitive underbelly, which threatens to exacerbate the mental health struggles faced by many students. and fosters a toxic, competitive academic environment.
So while we see the UC’s proposal of making pass-fail grading more accessible to students this semester as a temporary, urgent fix, we really ought to use this opportunity to think more broadly about how the assessment of student performance at the College could be more productive and fairer.
There are many ways we hope Harvard might be different when we return; might our current grading system be one of them?

Stephen K. Bannon, Jared C. Kushner ’03, Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., Michael R. Pompeo, Elaine Chao, R. Alexander Acosta ’90, Rod J. Rosenstein, Anthony Scaramucci, Kayleigh M. McEnany. Those are just the names you’ve heard.
There is also Rachel L. Brand, Sarah I. Flores, Jeffrey A. Rosen, Stacy Cline Amin, John F. Bash III ’03, Ann M. Donaldson, Gregory G. Katsas, Michael H. McGinley, Schuyler J. Schouten, Zina G. Bash ’04, Avrahm Berkowitz, Kenneth I. Juster ’76, Gilbert B. Kaplan ’73, and Henry J. Kerner.
The list of Harvard graduates who have gone on to lead, advise, and staff the Trump administration is extensive. For some, this may seem like business as usual. Harvard has been educating future presidents and Cabinet members from across the political spectrum since before the American Revolution. Those leaders have changed the world in remarkably positive ways, but have also made critical errors, led us into unjustifiable wars, and put forth policies that have destroyed communities.
For better and worse, the impact of Harvard alumni reaches practically every geography and field of study. One University-wide survey claims that, as of 2015, Harvard alumni had started 146,429 organizations, created 20.4 million jobs globally, and served on almost 300,000 boards.
On its website, Harvard boasts over 371,000 living alumni across 202 countries. I’ve spent nine of the past 10 years at Ivy League institutions and hold no illusions that these degree factories are beacons of righteousness. Surely, we cannot expect a university of Harvard’s scale to track and answer for the actions of each of its graduates. I also understand that intellectually rigorous environments celebrate both experiential and ideological diversity. Inevitably, then, alumni will tread a range of paths.
The Trump administration’s critical mass of Harvard alumni, however, is distinct and the University should address it. Dozens of Harvard alumni seem more than eager to assist the Trump administration in its horrific actions, lending Harvard's institutional legitimacy to an administration that opposes the University's mission.
Trump and his army of Harvard graduates hope to dismantle democracy, undermine the very concept of truth, and expunge the scientific community. Harvard owes its past, current, and future community members a statement of its position on the defective alumni it has produced — alumni who are destroying the fields and institutions students came here to study.
The University’s mission is “to advance new ideas and promote enduring knowledge.” Jared Kushner had the “new idea” to sacrifice Americans to the market in the face of COVID-19. Steve Bannon had the new idea to defraud taxpayers in a racist “We Build The Wall” scheme. Kayleigh McEnany had the new idea to spread disinformation about vote-by-mail, despite voting by mail 11 times in 10 years, including while at Harvard.
The “enduring knowledge” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been poisoned by disinformation. The enduring knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration is under siege. The enduring knowledge of our country’s Department of Education is being unraveled.
Harvard’s silence on graduates as recent as 2016 using their Harvard degrees to wage a full-fledged assault on the truth is unworthy of the University’s own “Veritas” motto. Failure to take a position or set the record straight on Harvard’s expectations of its alumni is a tacit endorsement that power itself is the school’s only true value. Discussions of ethical and moral leadership in my classes at Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School ring hollow against this reality. Harvard should publicly commit to higher expectations for its alumni than achieving the social cachet to dance with the stars (as former Harvard Institute of Politics fellow Sean Spicer quite literally did last year).
Some may argue alumni have engaged with the Trump Administration because they saw themselves as the lesser evil to fill an important position that would otherwise go to a crony. Evidence does not support this claim. Take, for example, Rachel Brand, who NBC reported resigned from the Department of Justice just in time to dodge the responsibility of leading the consequential Russia investigation. Brand was in line to replace fellow Harvard Law School alumni Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should he be fired for standing up to Trump. But Rosenstein ended up abetting Trump instead. We’ll never know the truth, as fellow Harvard Law School alumna and then-DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Flores denied the accusation against Brand.
My call for Harvard to publicly commit to values consistent with its mission by denouncing its cartel of Trump administration alumni must not be conflated with efforts to have prominent universities rescind degrees. Society evolves, attitudes change, and to start revoking degrees based on post-graduation activities could set a dangerous precedent.
But there is little downside to Harvard publicly assuring its community members that it is not proud to have produced a large part of this indefensible regime. Harvard is already under attack from the Trump administration in both courts of law and the court of public opinion. Publicly acknowledging its role in empowering this collective of bad actors could lead to much needed community reflection on ethical principles and standards across University curricula. Who is Harvard admitting and what are they not learning here? Harvard’s students, faculty, and staff deserve to know if the University stands by these leaders whose minds it claims to have crafted — leaders who most likely would not have reached their perch without Harvard’s stamp of approval.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard received a donation to revamp and rename its School of Public Health in 2014, most press releases and public coverage focused on the more amicable face of the deal. Gerald L. Chan, the "science enthusiast," was the only individual donor named in the University's official press release. Our own newspaper detailed his “quiet leadership”; we noted his extensive links to the University. Sure, naming an entire school after a donor (or, in this case, his father) was unconventional and entirely unprecedented. But given Gerald Chan's commitment to our institution and the fact that the sum was the largest donation in our history, we all settled in to enjoy the newly well-funded, School of Public Health — few questions asked.
Yet the donation didn't come from Gerald Chan — not directly, and certainly not exclusively. The official donor was in fact the Morningside Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit co-founded by Gerald and his brother Ronnie C. Chan.
A brief gloss of the foundation itself reveals that the Chan gift was significantly more complicated than the optimistic University press release. For one, the funding for the gift is at least somewhat unclear. The Morningside Foundation's publicly available 990 tax returns from 2014 cite three sources of income. Among them are two companies named after East Asian teas, Bancha and Keemun Inc, both located at the same Iowa address (one that's linked to Morningside Private Investors, another Chan Venture). Both donated the exact same amount, $1.05 million. But I couldn’t find any other mention of either company in the public domain, certainly not the presence you might expect for corporations engaging in millionaire philanthropy. These attributes — bland names, lack of an internet presence, stated address that lacks any kind of relevant professional infrastructure — are all typical of shell companies (though in all fairness my review of the existing record, or lack thereof, doesn't allow me to discern whether Bancha and Keemun do covertly engage in some extremely profitable, million-dollar generating business). The third Morningside donor, and the main source of the Harvard gift, is the “Echo Enterprises International Holdings Group Limited.” Its Monaco address appears in the Offshore Leaks Database of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists as relevant in the Panama Papers, and linked to yet another Chan Venture, Stealth BioTherapeutics. The Morningside Foundation did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
So how the funds for Harvard’s largest gift got to the Morningside Foundation (and their precise origin) is uncertain, at best; the University's apparent reluctance to identify who is behind their most significant gift ever irresponsible, at least (University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the matter). The entire thing seems slightly too on the nose; it doesn't raise eyebrows as much as it shoots them straight from one's forehead to the top of the sky.
And while Gerald Chan’s role in securing the donation has received significant attention, his brother Ronnie also seems to have played a crucial part in securing the gift. Outlets across both Europe and China dubbed him a “philanthropist” because of it; noting his role in co-founding Morningside as well as his status as chairman of the Hang Lung Group, the Chan family corporation that has pushed the brothers’ net worth into the ten-figure range. The line between the Hang Lung Group and the Morningside Foundation is at times blurry: the brothers serve on both ventures simultaneously — Gerald Chan is a non-executive director at Hang Lung and Ronnie Chan has gone as far as suggesting that his family’s stakes in the corporation are now part of Morningside Group’s assets. Portraying the donation as anything but a joint brotherly venture seems disingenuous, at best.
The question remains — who is Ronnie Chan? Jimmy Lai, the recently-arrested Hong Kong pro-democracy news mogul dubbed him a "pawn of the CCP" on Twitter, perhaps rightly so. As the Chans' Hang Lung Group has expanded from Hong Kong into the mainland, Ronnie Chan has found himself increasingly defensive of Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong. For one, he was an outspoken supporter of Leung Chun-ying, the former chief executive of Hong Kong whose tenure was marked by massive protests over attempts at giving Beijing the ability to pre-screen the city’s leadership. Ronnie Chan’s tenure as co-chair of the Asia Society’s Hong Kong Chapter proves particularly revealing of his ideology. During his time at the helm, the organization canceled the screening of a film centered on the 2014 Umbrella Movement citing “political concerns”, and barred Joshua Wong — a leader of the Umbrella Movement who has faced repeated state harassment for his work — from an event.
Wong, who was barred from attending a book launch commemorating the Hong Kong handover in 2017, reflected on the events via email. “Asia Society's Hong Kong chapter that Ronnie Chan co-chaired has long been slammed for censorship and political screening in the city,” he said, adding that “rather than an ordinary businessman, Chan also has close ties with Beijing authority.” Wong goes even further, asking whether Chan's decisions to build connections to U.S. universities while suppressing dissent at home are linked. “People begin to wonder if Chan plays a supplementary role in China's global propaganda campaign.” Representatives from the Asia Society's Hong Kong chapter and the Hang Lung Group did not respond to requests for comment in an attempt to reach Chan.
Such concerns are certainly warranted — that same year, Ronnie Chan received the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the highest award offered by Hong Kong’s government, cementing his ties to the mainland’s political establishment. These ties are noticeable elsewhere — Chan is also the governor of the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a registered foreign agent chaired by Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Chan has even faced accusations that he triggered the censoring and eventual termination of Forbes Magazine contributor Anders Corr ’08, who wrote a piece critical of Chan only to watch it vanish from the Forbes website the following morning (Hong Kong-based Integrated Whale Media Investments bought a majority stake of Forbes back in 2014; Forbes Media did not respond to a request for comment for this article). The events highlight Ronnie Chan’s role within a broader push by Beijing authorities to exert control over speech not only at home but abroad — ranging from blacklisting and expelling foreign journalists, to pressuring the NBA and its affiliates to disavow tweets supportive of pro-democracy demonstrators. That a figure so linked to the polity behind these efforts (and allegedly responsible for some censorship himself) could be honored by the University and even have a school named after his late father, is simply unconscionable.
Orville H. Schell ’62, Arthur Ross Director of the Asia Society New York's Center on U.S.-China Relations, thinks that Ronnie Chan’s motivations are likely economic. Schell, who calls the Asia Society's Hong Kong chapter “quite insufferable and quite repellant,” was blunt about Ronnie Chan's ambitions. “I’ve known Ronnie Chan for many decades — and he has his interests, which is doing business with China.” That might seem cold, calculating, and eerily familiar — because it is. Ronnie Chan seemingly seeks to appease an increasingly authoritarian government for money, and Harvard renames an entire school after his family — all with just enough legal and financial opacity to make it impossible to ascertain the funds’ origins.
As always, the damage goes beyond the poetic irony of having a school of public health renamed on behalf of a cheerleader for a government responsible for significant humanitarian crises. Harvard is incredibly influential in shaping American perceptions of China. Schell mentions Harvard’s influence on his own career, adding that “every person who's a China specialist” is somehow associated with the University. Harvard’s decision to cozy up to oligarchs (even having student delegations visit think tanks that are legally registered as foreign agents) can have a tangible impact on future policy, particularly at a time when transoceanic exchange is, according to Schell, shaped by the fear of being too blunt and losing any chance of engagement.
“We all have to dance on the edge of that razor blade,” he says. The question is how far we'll go to preserve that access (and those donations) — and at what cost.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The days immediately following the 2016 presidential election saw an uptick in hospitalizations for acute cardiovascular disease from the week prior, Harvard researchers have found.
The study, published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, was co-authored by Harvard School of Public Health professor David R. Williams and instructor Elizabeth Mostofsky.
The authors noted that, while previous research suggests certain events can trigger potentially lethal acute cardiovascular disease episodes such as strokes and heart attacks “within hours to days,” scant research has been conducted on the effects of socio-political events — including presidential elections.
The researchers compared hospitalization rates for acute cardiovascular disease at Kaiser Permanente Southern California — an integrated health system — in the days before and after the 2016 election. They found that the rate of hospitalizations across the two days following Election Day was 1.62 times higher than the rate of patients who were admitted for similar issues on those same calendar days the week before.
As the nation gears up for another presidential election during a global pandemic, the team’s findings may be of increasing concern to America’s health care providers. The next presidential election will take place on Nov. 3 — less than a month away.
Ultimately, the authors noted that more research should be conducted to examine the intersection of sociopolitical events and cardiovascular disease.
“Transiently heightened cardiovascular risk around the 2016 election may be attributable to sociopolitical stress,” the paper states. “Further research is needed to understand the intersection between major sociopolitical events, perceived stress, and acute CVD.”

Harvard Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote to administrators Friday to ensure managers provide “scheduling flexibility” to enable staff members to vote.
In her email, Hausammann cited recent messages from University President Lawrence S. Bacow termed voting the “first responsibility of citizenship.”
“I write to echo those sentiments and to ask you to ensure that your managers provide scheduling flexibility to your staff members (particularly those who are paid hourly and who are working on-site) as they exercise their right to vote,” she wrote.
The email — sent to vice presidents, executive deans, and administrative deans — also noted that it is a policy at the University that “an employee must be given time off with pay if such time off is necessary to vote.”
Hausammann’s email comes after 850 individuals in the past week signed onto a petition to Bacow to designate Election Day a holiday at Harvard.
The petition’s organizer, Jack M. Swanson ’22, called the email from Hausman “great” as a way of reminding staff members of the existing policy but said it is not enough because it places pressures on workers to request time off from their managers.
“We want to make it as friendly as possible for people to vote,” he said. “You don't want people to consider not voting because they're going to have to speak to the manager about getting that time off.”
Swanson noted that early voters have already experienced extended wait times at polling places in cities like Atlanta.
“I don't think it's a stretch to assume that election day is going to have horrific lines,” he said. “So if we were really trying to acknowledge what's actually going to happen on November 3, we need to make sure we understand that people are going to need the entire day off.”
“This is not a do it on your lunch break kind of thing,” Swanson added.
In her email to administrators, Hausammann referenced the special circumstances created by COVID-19.
“The pandemic and related public health safeguards may mean that the time needed to vote is longer than it would have been in past years, and it may be difficult to complete voting before or after work, especially if those hours are consumed with long commutes and child care drop-off and pick-ups,” she wrote.
“Your understanding and encouragement of your team to be flexible in allowing time to vote is appreciated,” Hausammann added.
Swanson still hopes the University will take the next step and designate the day a holiday.
“I say that because if Harvard were to announce that election day were a holiday, I have no doubt that many other universities and institutions would follow suit,” he said. “At the very least, it would spawn some kind of a push for other organizations to do the same.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the criticisms.
The internal message is “missing out on a big opportunity to show how much voting matters,” Swanson said.
He said he also still worries about the University’s 30,000 students who may need time off from class to vote or volunteer at the polls, given that only some professors may be understanding of such commitments.
“The best thing we can do is to just say, this is a holiday for every single person, staff and students alike,” Swanson said. “It doesn't matter who your professor is. It doesn't matter who your manager is. You're going to get the day off, and you're going to have the opportunity to vote in the election and engage in whatever way you see fit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to collaborate with the College Events Board on a College-wide virtual Halloween costume contest Sunday.
Council members drafted the legislation, sponsored by Lowell House representative Samyra C. Miller ’21 and Dunster House representative Ethan J. Johnstone ’23, in order to provide holiday-related cheer to students who cannot attend the CEB’s flagship Halloween event, a virtual “Haunted Harvard” activity scheduled for Oct. 28.
The legislation stated that Halloween is “a time for students to show off their creativity.” It asked the Council to run a Halloween costume contest through its Instagram account during the last week of October.
College students would use the hashtag “harvardhalloween20” and post their costumes on social media. The Council would then work with the CEB to select finalists, for whom students could vote by “liking” their photos on both groups’ social media accounts.
The winners of the contest will receive prizes from a student-run small business, Harvard Honey Shop, which is owned and operated by Kelsey A. Hoskin ’21. The shop sells Harvard-themed stickers and clothing.
“We’re going to have first, second, and third place prizes, and they’re all going to be different Harvard Honey products, little prize bundles, and I’ll be releasing those through the Harvard Honey site,” Hoskin said.
Distance and time zone differences would limit students’ ability to celebrate the holiday normally, according to the legislation, which passed unanimously.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic dispersed a majority of undergraduates, Halloween at Harvard was a festive affair. In 2018, the CEB hosted a trick-or-treat in Harvard Yard, Halloween decor adorned Annenberg Hall, and professors and resident deans dressed up for the holiday.
Miller said she thought the costume contest could increase engagement among the student body.
“We’re just trying to get more engagement on our social media,” she added.
The Council also discussed its upcoming presidential election during Sunday’s meeting, voting to approve new rules and to update its website. Until the end of October, students can gather signatures in favor of adding referendum questions to the Council ballot. At least 10 percent of undergraduates must sign a petition in favor of those questions.
In past years, referenda have related to topics like fossil fuel and prison divestment, dining services hours, and University sexual misconduct policies.

A group of Harvard Kennedy School students, alumni, faculty and staff sent HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf an open letter Friday requesting he designate Election Day a school holiday.
The letter, which 169 signatories have currently endorsed, asked that the school deem Nov. 3 a holiday to “encourage students, faculty, and staff to be active participants in our democracy.” It emphasized the need for civic engagement beyond voting, citing how the COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for poll workers because the virus poses a higher risk to older volunteers from past cycles.
The open letter quoted an email Dean Elmendorf sent in 2018. At the time he wrote that “days on which voting occurs—in this country and others—are important moments for public service,” and that “fulfilling your civic responsibility is compatible with fulfilling your responsibilities to the School.”
The open letter urged the dean to “inspire” students, staff, and faculty at the Kennedy School to engage civically and called on Elmendorf to “set an example” for other universities and organizations across the country. Harvard affiliates have also called on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to make Election Day a Harvard-wide holiday.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith did not respond to a request for comment on the petition.
The open letter comes on the heels of a private petition sent to the dean on October 8 by a group of student leaders at the Kennedy School.
The petition, a bipartisan effort, was co-signed by the chairs of the school’s Republican and Democratic Caucuses, Kennedy School Student Government representatives, and organizers from the Harvard Votes Challenge. Lauren M. Lombardo, the Republican Caucus co-chair, said having Election Day off is an important way to encourage all forms of civic engagement.
“I mostly think it's important that students, faculty and staff should be able to engage in the electoral process however they choose to. And for some people, that's going to include wanting to work on campaigns or work on nonpartisan ‘get out the vote’ efforts or work as poll workers. And I think that we should encourage as many people as are inclined to do that work, to be involved in the process in that way,” Lombardo said.
The private petition cited a report on student voting rates from Tufts University, which noted that only 40.1 percent of eligible Harvard graduate students voted in the 2016 election.
Elmendorf denied the students’ request in a response to their letter, though he said he recognized the importance of voting.
“Whether the Kennedy School, or the University as a whole, should declare U.S. Election Day as a holiday is a question that has received attention for some time, as you note,” Elmendorf wrote. “However, the country has not made that change, and neither has the University, and the Kennedy School will not this year either.”
The Kennedy School Student Government expressed disappointment with the administration’s decision in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
“While current federal policy does not make Election Day a holiday, we believe that an institution with the Harvard Kennedy School’s power and privilege can be a strong voice and lead to making it a national holiday. While we disagree with this decision we will continue to work with the administration to ensure that professors are encouraged to excuse absences for students participating in voting or serving as election volunteers,” the statement reads.
Elmendorf also referenced the Kennedy School’s online semester, writing that the virtual nature of classes provides more flexibility for students to carry out voting-related tasks on Election Day.
“For students and faculty, the virtual nature of classes hopefully provides additional flexibility for their voting and other election-related activities on that day. Moreover, with so much early and absentee voting now in the country, I expect that some members of our community are engaging in Election Day-type activities already,” Elmendorf wrote.
However, some students said they are skeptical that virtual classes truly allow students more flexibility. Alina M. Clough, the co-chair of the Republican Caucus, expressed that virtual learning is more time-intensive than Elmendorf thinks.
“I think there's this idea that because you're doing virtual learning, that absolutely everyone is sitting at home between classes on the couch eating Cheetos,” she said. “I think the perception that we have a lot of free time is much different than the reality for many students, especially those who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds or who don't necessarily have the economic freedom to be focusing entirely on school and absolutely nothing else.”

Charles A. Murray ’65 spoke to Harvard affiliates at a Friday webinar about his new book, which criticizes the idea that race and gender are social constructs. Faculty in attendance criticized his work, saying it makes unfounded claims and is rooted in flawed methodology.
Government preceptor David D. Kane invited Murray — whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center terms “racist pseudoscience” – to speak about his 2020 book “Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class” as part of a lecture series entitled “Data Scientists, Data Professionals, Data Dissidents.”
Murray said during the talk that many of Harvard’s social science and humanities faculty are “outdated” in their belief that race is a social construct.
“We know that the allele frequencies for different population groups on traits are quite different,” he said. “And the chance that once we untangle the effects of these, that they’ll balance out to zero, is statistically just about impossible.”
Sociology professor Mary C. Waters, who attended the webinar, criticized Murray’s research, writing in an email that he frequently committed the “elementary error” of confusing correlation with causation throughout his talk.
“Murray's performance was embarrassing and certainly does not reflect excellence in data science or social science,” she wrote. “His work is very weak. He cherry picks data and studies that suit his desired conclusions and he does not seem to understand the issues he writes about.”
Murray has courted controversy since 1994, when he co-authored the bestselling book, “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life.” The book posited that differences in intelligence between classes are partially attributable to race and ethnicity, an argument that has since been widely discredited.
In the more recent “Human Diversity,” Murray critiques the social science “orthodoxy” that gender and race are social constructs and that class is a function of privilege. He presents ten counter-propositions, including claims that there are real differences in personality between the sexes, that there are genetic distinctions corresponding to self-identified race and ethnicity, and that class structure has a significant basis in genetic differences.
Harvard students and faculty protested Murray’s talk the last time he spoke on campus, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a recent interview that she does not believe Murray’s work has academic merit.
During the webinar, Murray acknowledged that his parts of his work have been co-opted by white supremacist groups to advance racist agendas.
“Is it a fact that [there are] some white nationalist groups and white supremacist groups that misuse ‘The Bell Curve?’” Murray asked.
“Yeah,” he said. “On the other hand, is there any scholar out there who has written any work that has gotten a lot of attention on a controversial topic that has not been misused? That's not my problem.”
“I am not dependent upon the opinions of Harvard faculty who I suspect have never read a word I've written,” he also said.
Sociology professor Jocelyn Viterna, who attended the talk, wrote in an email that she has indeed read “Human Diversity” and found that its logic was unsound.
“Murray’s new book once again argues that environmental factors don’t matter as much as biological factors, but once again, it bases the argument on assumption and speculation, and not on a careful, data-driven analysis,” she wrote. “It also flat out ignores the extensive, data driven, carefully analyzed, peer reviewed research that already demonstrates, over and over again, how social factors shape inequality.”
She added that Murray “didn’t have a single thing of substance to say” during his talk when presented with “thoughtful” questions about how he arrived at his conclusions about the role genetics play in shaping individuals and societal inequalities.
“Murray rambled a great deal about how mistreated he has been, but there were no data, and there was certainly no science; just a good deal of deflecting and pouting,” she added.
Murray did not respond to a request for comment about Waters and Viterna’s statements.
During the talk, Murray expressed frustration at the censure he has previously received from professors at Harvard and beyond for his work, characterizing the present moment as an “intellectual dark age.”
“The idea that Veritas is no longer an appropriate ideal for the University — that instead it must be the advancement of social justice that is the purpose of the University — is, to my mind, a tragic event,” he said.
Murray, however, was not the only one to receive rebuke. Waters also wrote that she and her fellow social science faculty in attendance were disturbed by the fact that Kane disabled the public chat, instead asking participants to ask questions through a private submission function.
Waters wrote that disabling the chat precluded “the back and forth between speaker and audience that academic scholarly debate requires.”
Waters further criticized Kane’s decision to invite Murray to speak to students.
“The choice of Murray for a data science class and the way that Kane was afraid of allowing real debate makes me question Kane's qualifications for teaching,” she wrote. “Harvard students deserve better instructors and better guest lecturers.”
Kane did not respond to a request for comment on the decisions to invite Murray and disable the chat function.
This contentious webinar comes two weeks after Government professor Kosuke Imai replaced Kane as course head of Government 50: “Data,” following student allegations that Kane authored racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog. Imai also wrote to Gov 50 students that he felt “dismay” at the decision to invite Murray.
Kane wrote to Gov 50 students Thursday that he removed the course name from the speaker series “since there is no connection between the two, other than my involvement in both.”
At the end of the talk — during which Murray also called the SAT’s so-called “adversity index” a “PR ploy” and said he does not know “who to trust in the climate change debate” — Kane said “we may invite Charles to come back.”
“You’re a sucker for punishment,” Murray said to him.
“I’m a fool and proud of it,” Kane responded.

If you haven’t been living under a big rock, then you know that 2020 is an election year, and we’re just a couple of weeks away from the big day. Call it quarantine or call it the increased civic engagement our generation desperately needs, but people are more ready and excited than ever to vote this November. From pledging to vote, to text banking, to voter education, hear all about what students on campus are doing to increase voter awareness and why it’s so important to vote, vote, vote!
Voter Registration Deadlines
Since it’s October, voter registration deadlines are starting to roll around. If you’re otherwise eligible to vote and simply have not registered, make sure that the simple and fast approaching deadline isn’t what is stopping you! The Harvard Votes Challenge has a straightforward way to register. If you think you’ve registered but just aren’t sure, this is a great place to check. 
Pledge to Vote
While voter turnout on Harvard’s campus has been lackluster in the past, student groups, individuals, and athletic teams are committed to making sure that isn’t the case this year! Kevin L. Ballen ’22 from the Harvard Votes Challenge said that “young people vote at the lowest rates across the country, even on our campus. Only 48.6% of students turned out to vote at Harvard in 2018. We go to this institution that prides itself on being a civic leader, but we’re not turning out the ballot box and we have to change that.” Over half of Harvard’s athletic teams and many more student groups have partnered with the Harvard Votes Challenge to achieve a 100 percent voter turnout this year. If you haven’t already, you can individually pledge to vote here, too!
Voter Awareness and Education
In addition to the Institute of Politics’s many voter education initiatives, cultural organizations across campus have stepped up to make sure they’re involved in discussions of voting’s importance. Earlier this semester, over 25 affinity organizations including the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, Harvard Hillel, and the Harvard Caribbean Club hosted “Interconnections & Elections: A Cross-Cultural Voting Kickoff" to encourage civic participation among people of various cultural backgrounds. The event featured a panel discussion with leaders in protecting voting rights among communities of color, as well as student conversations. Trisha N. Prabhu ’22 — the President of Harvard South Asian Americans in Public Service, the student group that organized the event — says they were inspired to put the event together because their goal is to create opportunities for public service, and voting is a perfect way to do that.
“When we vote, we say that democracy matters, we say that our voices matter, and we help shape the world we live in. We want to speak to the fact that there are huge inequities across groups when it comes to voting and have a serious conversation about how communities of color have been barred from voting both historically and today,” Prabhu said. “We wanted to acknowledge those realities and explore why given that, it’s so important that communities vote.”
“In just a couple years, we’ll no longer be students,” she added. “It’s important for our generation to vote because it demonstrates that we can step up and take action on important issues. There’s so many circumstances we can’t control, especially this year, but have to take action on what we can.”
Other Resources
Of course, there are obstacles to voting, especially during a pandemic. But thankfully, these aren’t too difficult to get around. Ballen said there are more people registered on campus than people who turn out, often because of missed deadlines. Harvard Votes challenge is trying to bridge that gap, and you can reach out for access to stamps, envelopes and printing for students who need to fill out forms to register and request absentee ballots. “We often hear people say their vote doesn’t matter, but they’re referring to presidential elections. [They’re] not focusing on local elections with real consequences from school funding to healthcare to criminal justice reform and we have to pay attention to them,” Ballen said.
There’s a lot happening this year, and you don’t want to miss out. Make sure you’re ready and excited to vote in the upcoming election! If you’re eligible, whether you’re on campus or remote, there are plenty of resources available to make sure you are ready to be civically engaged by casting your ballot. Happy voting!
