After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
DUSHANBE, Takijistan—It’s 3:10 in the morning, and in the starlight, I can make out the outline on the tablecloth of bread, teacups, a tub of Turkish Nutella, and two bowls of “shirchai,” a warm soup made from whole milk, butter, and tea leaves.  I sit in the  darkness with my host grandmother, and as I eat my fill of the  smorgasbord, I can hear the soft clinking of forks, knives, and spoons  against bowls and plates across our neighborhood and across Dushanbe,  the capital of the small mountainous republic of Tajikistan.
This morning meal, known in Persian as “sahari,” marks the first meal of Ramadan, Islam’s holy month, where most able-bodied Muslims strive to fast from the first light of dawn until sunset.  This year, Ramadan falls in the heart of the summer, and for most here, the combination of 17 hours without food or drink and heat that exceeds 100 degrees every day is extremely challenging.  For those who can fast, though, this shared meal in the darkness of the morning represents the beginning of a long month of discipline, charity, and kindness.
As it has for most of this summer, Tajikistan continues to challenge my preconceptions of it as the day passes.  My stomach growls and my mouth grows dry, but most restaurants remain open, and Rudaki avenue remains a vibrant cross-section of Tajik society.  On my walk (linked), I even pass several young people eating ice cream on the street, an action that could get one a strong legal rebuke in many other countries.
The day grows long, and on the trolleybus towards home, men in traditional caps wearily nod in and out of sleep and women in their vibrant “kurtas” lean back in their seats, the hot afternoon breeze sapping their energy 14 hours into the fast.
And finally it is eight in the evening, the moment of sunset.  With my host grandmother, we sit in the courtyard, giving thanks for the food, things, and people in our lives.  And as the darkness falls once again over Dushanbe, we eat quietly, the sounds of cutlery on porcelain again clinking skywards as the rest of Tajikistan breaks their fast.

NEW YORK—New York is New York. That is, the entire world compressed into a little box, a special kind of concentrated chaos.
I’m interning at a small magazine and the offices are temporarily in the editor’s living room, while the staff prepares for a move to Manhattan. It works, though, because almost all of the work is done remotely. Us four interns are only really in the workspace three days a week, and do most of our editing and writing work in our apartments, or coffee shops, or whatever other relatively quiet spaces we can find amid the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple.
I don’t know many people here, so after the social intensity of the school year I’ve had to put some serious work into the project of finding ways to be alone without being lonely. I keep occupied by setting myself small tasks and spacing them out over the week. This Monday was grocery shopping, today was laundry, and Thursday will be an excursion to Chinatown to buy tofu and green tea, because it’s cheaper there, and better anyway. And then, of course, there is the frequent search for coffee shops, the process of picking out a neighborhood and the compilation of a small list of cafes that have wi-fi and outlets. And then the purchase of my cup of coffee and five or so hours of editing and writing, and the trip home on the subway again to eat leftovers. I have not eaten out once since I’ve been here. The rent is too damn high, and I just don’t have the money.
For a very long while the isolation and the relative monotony affected me deeply, and I felt frustrated and lonely. And on top of the ironies of feeling isolated in a city of eight million and not having spending money in the one place one can buy everything, there was the culture shock. For the first couple of weeks, I didn’t go a day without calling my mother and telling her some story about the way New York had been rude to me or had harassed me or had just been too damn big. Boston makes its own sort of sense, I would say, but this place just feels like a giant jumble, a crazy amalgam of everything all at once from which there is no escape.
But gradually, quietly, we reconciled ourselves with one another, New York and I. Somewhere between my trips to the Met to see the impressionists and my lunchbox dinners in Central Park and my two-mile walk to the Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens (I got off at the wrong subway stop), I found a rhythm. I would probably never quite feel like I had a grasp on this place, but that was okay. It was okay to feel lost, to drift a bit, to let myself wander through life for a while. And it was a beautiful opportunity when contrasted with my life at college, where I only ever had time to follow maps meticulously.
So I sleep, and I eat, and I edit, and I cook, and I drink coffee at an increasingly long list of cafes in the East Village.
And for now, that’s enough.

If Obama’s June announcement—that the United States will begin funneling arms to Syrian rebels in an attempt to help them fight off the armies of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad—says anything, it’s this: Iraq still hangs on America’s mind. A seven-year occupation may be over, but the impact of the war is heavy. Its influence in Obama’s new regional initiative is obvious; its effects hang over the recent NSA scandal and the still-open Guantanamo Bay. Depositing weapons in the hands of the rebels is only the latest in a series of convoluted decisions the government has made in the Middle East since Iraq that reflect the unclear decision-making standard of Bush and Obama.
There are eerie parallels between the Syrian despot of today and the Saddam Hussein regime of 10 years ago. Hussein, a dictator America threw its full support behind in 1987 when the leader was murdering Kurds with chemical weapons in a conflict with Iran, was overthrown by the American military in 2003. Even before he took office, leaked Wikileaks documents showed that Obama had already begun to court al-Assad as a potential ally when al-Assad, who previously declared support for Hezbollah, had not yet renounced support for the Lebanese militant group. In both cases, thousands of deaths were not enough to compel American involvement (93,000 and counting in Syria). The line that could not be crossed were the development of deadly weapons: the alleged weapons of mass destruction of Hussein and the now-disputed (at least by Russia) chemical weapons of Assad.
However, the similarity of the two situations demonstrates a pair of exceptions, not the rule. In fact, finding a rule for foreign policy in the last 10 years has been nearly impossible with the two administrations, which share similarities that are all the more unsettling when contemplating that Obama ran an “anti-Bush” campaign in 2008. Justifying their tactics under the “war on terror” umbrella, the two administrations have provided different reasons for each foray into the Middle East.
The first was democracy. When the military first overthrew Hussein, America attempted to install a Western style democracy in Iraq for the seven years of its occupation. The same interventionist standard fell by the river, however, when it came to repressive monarchies like Saudi Arabia—a nation whose oil trade with the United States proved more important than its style of government. Obama was no more committed to this ideal than Bush was, as the Arab Spring demonstrated. The president sided with Egyptian rebels pushing for democracy but sent funds to a Bahranian government shooting rounds into peaceful democratic protestors.
The second justification was civil rights. Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to President Bush, was about bringing civil liberties to the people of the Middle East and saving terrorized populations from violent despots. Libya, and the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gadaffi, had similar justifications. The policy is implemented intermittently, however; while drug violence caused nearly 16,000 deaths in Mexico last year alone, the government has done little to protect its neighbors. Similarly, when in 2008, 45,000 people a month were dying in the Congo, American forces were nowhere to be found.
It’s important to note that there are few advocates for a consistent interventionist policy. After all, America is not the world’s police and even as its lone superpower, should not feel the obligation to be. However, that doesn’t spare Obama and Bush the onus of justifying their Middle East interventions under a consistent foreign policy. While the United States can’t be everywhere, that phrase is a cop out and not a justification. For two presidents who have presided over Guantanamo Bay and the evolution of drone strikes, expressing concern for civil liberties abroad is not only absurdly hypocritical but also an insufficient justification.
A number of smaller dichotomies further illuminate the contrasts at play in the policies of the two. While Obama has been anti-war, placing non-interventionists John Kerry and Chuck Hagel in key cabinet positions, he is anti-violence, expanding drone policies and issuing a secret memo authorizing the killing of overseas American terrorist suspects. Even as the government criticizes the rest of the Middle East for its repressive policies, mum has been the word on Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip.
With its origins in Iraq, the “war of terror” justification persists today in Syria. For Dan Drezner, the arming of the rebels is a ploy against regional foes Hezbollah and Iran, each of which have supplied weapons and forces to al-Assad’s efforts. This realpolitik, as Drezner describes it, is yet another foreign policy change. By extending the war, even at the cost of human lives, America helps to drain the resources of its enemies in the region, waging a war on terror under the pretense of preserving human rights. With the rebels facing a last stand of sorts—20,000 al-Assad militiamen have been fighting the rebels in Aleppo, the resistance’s main stronghold, since June—Obama’s sudden pivot is less surprising.
As the president, navigating the complex maze of foreign diplomacy is one of the job’s toughest tasks. Not only are commanders-in-chief responsible for the actions of those who came before them, they have the unenviable proposition of being the leader of the world’s only superpower. Both Bush and Obama took this responsibility by leading on a case-by-case basis; the Bush invasion of Iraq sprung the beginnings of a decade of haphazard actions in the Middle East where independent decisions form an less than cohesive foreign policy. Syria is only the latest Mediterranean quandary with an inconsistent resolution, likely not the last.

ARCHAIA OLYMPIA, Greece – Silence floods the cavernous space, whistling across the cold marble, making a serene pact with all within. The bright lights bathe the room like Olympian daylight, yet illuminate one figure in particular. He towers above me, calm, just, austere, and imposing. One of Mount Olympus’s most eligible bachelors, he’s tall, he’s handsome, and he’s powerful. I wonder how such a perfect man ever existed, even in the realm of myth. He must be based off someone real, right? And if so, why can’t I find someone like him today? The statue of Apollo holds me transfixed, and I stand and stare up at his perfect Greek god (literally) physique and his commanding presence of power. He faces to the left, his arm outstretched, restoring order to a frozen scene of chaos. Around him, a mess of entangled bodies writhes – Lapiths battling Centaurs, abducted women screaming for help. The moment hangs in the air for eternity, as if Apollo himself has commanded time to screech to a halt. He seems so utterly above it all, jaded like an aloof Brooklyn hipster transported to classical times.
What would my life seem like to Apollo? Would I join him in his alabaster perfection or am I too common, too mainstream for his Olympian taste? I am far from a flawless Greek goddess, but then again, flawlessness like Apollo’s doesn’t exist. Later that day I learned that the statue of Apollo didn’t even have a living male model – it was based off of a series of measurements, an ancient mathematical formula of perfect hairline-to-jawline ratios, shoulder widths and muscle masses – the Greek version of Photoshop. And while Apollo is immortal, he is fixed in time and space forever – endlessly passing his godly judgment on the Lapiths, while I am free to pass out of his gaze. However, he will forever be youthful and strong butI am subject to age and entropy. But what is better – an eternity of immobile certainty and perfection, or the ability to live, grow, make mistakes and transform as a person? His temples have crumbled while my life becomes more unpredictable, flawed, and beautiful every second that rolls by.  And while one of these deities with perfect Olympian proportions may never step off of his pedestal and into my life, I’ll find someone real, someone who will still love me even when I’m no longer young and beautiful.
Apollo can keep his flawless, peaceful, leisurely eternities.
I’m much too restless to live like that.

EDINBURGH, Scotland—Move over, Ginny Weasley: Edinburgh is in love with The Boy Who Lived.
Some background: struggling writer J.K. Rowling arrives in 1990s Edinburgh as a single welfare mom, gets a Scottish Arts Council grant, ends up writing international sensation “Harry Potter.”  Edinburgh is UNESCO’s first City of Literature—“built on books,” the tour guide said, and Rowling seems to crown the heap.  (Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, J.M. Barrie, Ian Rankin and others have also called Edinburgh home.)
On my first morning here, a guide leading a tour of important 18th-century sites made three stops related to Harry Potter within the first 15 minutes.  He even offered one lucky tourist a sorting hat and a festive Gryffindor scarf.
Some of the city’s Potter pride, however, seems a bit of a stretch.  The stadium where a military band performs?  Clearly a major inspiration for Quidditch matches.  The private school, once for orphaned boys, where Rowling sent her daughter?  Obviously Hogwarts.
Practically every Edinburgh resident I encountered pointed the way to The Elephant House, a café that bills itself as the “birthplace of Harry Potter.”  Rowling wrote much of her first Potter book here, and fans from across the world make pilgrimages (for what it’s worth, the grilled salmon burger with avocado and aioli is magical).
Other little tidbits of Potter lore suffuse the city.  Thomas Riddell (eerily similar to Tom Riddle of “Harry Potter”) is buried down the street from The Elephant House.  Diehard fans may be intrigued to know that while writing the first book, Rowling may have frequented the Spoon café more often.  Professor McGonagall of Hogwarts bears the surname of a notoriously bad Edinburgh poet.
After a while, the Potter spell seems to work.  Wandering the wynds and closes (narrow alleyways) that dart between Edinburgh’s dark stone buildings, one begins to imagine oneself in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.  Just substitute a dram of whiskey for the butterbeer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Three days into Donald H. Pfister’s tenure as interim Dean of the College, the walls are largely bare and the shelves not yet full in his new University Hall office. Only on his mantle is clear evidence that a systematic botanist now inhabits the administrative heart of Harvard’s flagship school: an enlarged print of a first-class stamp honoring Asa Gray, the botanist for whom Pfister’s professorship is named.
 
Pfister, who will lead the College during the search for a permanent dean, acknowledges that he has little time to make the office his own. “At the most, I’m looking at a year, probably,” he says in an interview in his office Friday afternoon.
 
Yet despite this transience, Pfister hopes to leave his mark on the College in the time he has.
“I want to be the dean that was able to do this community building and be able to bring the College life and academic life together in some way,” Pfister said. “That’s a big assignment for one year, but part of it is reaching out, being available, having the ability to work with a mixed constituency, in a way.”
But after a tumultuous year that some say has fractured the community he seeks to build, Pfister may face an uphill battle.
Pfister assumes the deanship, most recently held by Evelynn M. Hammonds, after a year marked by controversy—a massive cheating scandal and revelations of secret email searches that some believe led to Hammonds’s departure. Though well-acquainted with the workings of the College, Pfister faces the challenge of leading a student body that has grown skeptical of administrators without knowing how long he may have to effect change.
 
THE SEASONED ADMINISTRATOR
 
Several Undergraduate Council members predicted that the issues that dominated campus discussion this past year will again be the most pressing questions facing the College this fall. They and Pfister’s colleagues say that the new interim dean’s long resume has prepared him to address these issues.
 
Pfister, most recently the dean of Harvard Summer School and curator of the Farlow Reference Library and Herbarium, has taught at Harvard for nearly four decades. In that time, he has held multiple appointments in the College administration, serving as Kirkland House Master for 18 years and chairing a committee that reviewed the Administrative Board.
 
“He’s had his hand in virtually every aspect of the College that I can think of,” said Stephen A. Mitchell, a professor of Scandinavian and folklore who sat on the now-dissolved Committee to Review the Administrative Board with Pfister and served as Eliot House Master while Pfister was in Kirkland. “And so in that sense, he has a lot of things going for him.... He has seen things work.”
 
“He doesn’t have any ground to make up,” added former UC President Matthew L. Sundquist '09, the one student who served on the Ad Board review committee with Pfister. “He comes in on day 1 knowing how the College works in really every respect.”
 
In particular, students point to Pfister’s time heading the Ad Board review committee as experience that will serve him well in helping to guide the College’s ongoing conversation about academic integrity.
 
In 2009, Pfister’s committee issued a report that, among other proposed reforms, recommended further discussion about the creation of a second disciplinary board populated by students as well as faculty. Although such a board was not established following the report’s release, a recent honor code proposal has reignited the discussion.
The proposal, which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented to members of the faculty at their monthly meeting in April, outlines a five-point honor code that, among other points, would establish a Student/Faculty Judicial Board made up of both students and faculty to hear academic dishonesty cases. The Committee on Academic Integrity plans to solicit feedback on the proposal from students in the fall, according to Terah E. Lyons ’14, who serves on the committee and also helped draft the proposed honor code. In his capacity as Dean of the College, Pfister will chair the Ad Board as these discussions proceed.
Colleagues also nearly uniformly praise Pfister for his ability to connect with students, citing his almost two decades as a House Master.
“I don’t think you could get better training than somebody who’s been in the trenches in a House,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said.
 
A CALL FOR TRUST
But even with this experience, students caution that in his new role, Pfister will be hindered if he cannot reverse undergraduates’ skepticism and frustration with College administrators, which they say partly stems from this past spring’s email searches scandal.
In March, news broke that administrators had secretly searched resident deans’ email accounts to trace the source of a leak of a confidential Ad Board document pertaining to the Government 1310 cheating investigation. Several weeks later, Hammonds admitted to faculty at their monthly meeting that she had secretly authorized a second set of searches of a single resident dean’s faculty and administrative accounts without the necessary permission, thereby violating Faculty of Arts and Sciences email privacy policy.
 
When asked about his priorities for the upcoming year, Pfister said trust-building within the Harvard community is important, though he was not directly addressing the email searches.
 
For UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, “the first order of business for the dean” should be to regain students’ trust in the wake of the searches.
 
Although the searches did not target student accounts, undergraduates questioned their own email privacy following the revelations. And although an Office of Student Life official later said the rumors were untrue, students speculated in March that administrators had been searching email listservs the night of River Run, a prohibited tradition in which freshmen consume alcohol at the upperclassman River Houses the night before Housing Day.
“There are groups within the student body who are somewhat distrustful of the administration,” Leverett House UC representative Aaron E. Watanabe ’14 said, adding that he was not sure of the connection between this sentiment and the email searches. “Probably, if you polled everyone...you’d find that people were [leaning] a little bit more towards the distrust rather than trust side.”
 
Kanuparthy said students see the Ad Board, for example, as a “mystery.” And Currier UC representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who introduced UC legislation expressing “tremendous concern” over the email searches, said that this past year there was some level of distrust and skepticism toward the College administration coupled with doubts about its transparency.
“I think students want to see more communication, not only through something as impersonal as an email, but face-to-face communication,” said Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, who represented Crimson Yard in the UC this past year. “I think people want to know who their dean is, and I don’t know if that has been the case in the past.”
 
Hammonds, who officially left the deanship at the start of this month after her departure was announced in May, has been criticized previously for what some described as too-infrequent communication with undergraduates.
For his part, Pfister said that he will make an effort to reach out to students as dean, calling it a “priority.” To that end, he plans to eat in House dining halls, and although he said he has not yet worked out his schedule, he said he will aim to do so “certainly more than once a month.”
 
A TRANSIENT TENURE
 
Beyond student disillusionment with administrators, however, Pfister faces a challenge that stems from the transient nature of his new position, several students and colleagues say.
 
The length of Pfister’s tenure as interim dean will be limited by how long the search for the permanent dean takes. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has said that he will convene a search committee for the permanent dean in the fall but has not said when he expects to make an appointment.
 
In the past, faculty members have raised concerns over the impact of what former Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Theda R. Skocpol has termed “interim-ness” on Harvard’s ability to make progress on ongoing issues. In 2008, when David R. Pilbeam was serving as interim dean of the College, former UC President Ryan A. Petersen ’08 claimed that Pilbeam and other interim administrators unfamiliar with their roles had been “cavalier” in their decision-making.
 
Now, as Pfister begins his tenure, students question the impact an interim dean can have in a tenure that will be measured in months.
“You can’t underemphasize the fact that this is still an interim position,” Kanuparthy said, adding that he does not expect “grand shifts” in College policy during Pfister’s relatively short tenure.
Still, Elaine Scarry, an English professor who served on the Ad Board review committee with Pfister, said she believes Pfister’s extensive experience at the College will render his short tenure “less of an impediment [to progress] than it would normally be.”
 
For his part, Pfister said he believes that within the year he can take steps to foster community at the College for both students and faculty.
 
“I do want to make it very clear that this office needs to be out, needs to be visible, that the dean can do quite a lot by being a presence in the community,” Pfister said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force continued to debate their priorities for community benefits at their meeting Monday evening as part of an ongoing discussion about Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston development.
 
Harvard plans to file its master plan with the Boston city government on July 25, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications. Representatives from Harvard and the city have said that task force members will help inform the plan’s community benefits package, which is expected to set forth proposals for education programs and transportation improvements, among other services.
 
At Monday’s meeting, Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident who sits on the task force, called for further discussion about what form the community benefits package should take. 
Mattison proposed that rather than outlining specific projects that Harvard will finance, the community benefits package could take a “more general” form with the option of determining at a later date how residents would like to use money from Harvard to improve the neighborhood. Mattison said this solution might allow for some shorter-term projects while factoring in what he described as a “lack of information” about the costs and impact of other possible longer-term benefits—a concern that has been raised by task force members at past meetings.
 
Mattison proposed that the benefits package could “[dedicate] a certain fraction to short-term quality of life things like what we’ve been discussing, and then [take] the vast majority of it and [say] that more planning and study is needed.”
Gerald Autler, senior project manager with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said that he does not think that the two approaches Mattison described are “mutually exclusive.”
“Inevitably, we’re going to all have to continue working to define the programming in conjunction with the people who know more about those subjects than we do,” Autler said. “I think it would be a mistake not to pick some really meaningful projects right now that can be carried out in the shorter term.... But that doesn’t exclude the idea that we’re not going to define every single detail of these benefits right now.”
 
The task force also heard a presentation from the BRA that featured the results of a survey about residents’ priorities for community benefits as part of a recap of a recent community meeting about public realm and open space improvements. Autler said there were “a few priorities,” including improvements to Smith Field and Soldiers Field Road crossings, that “really rose to the top” at the previous meeting.
 
Monday’s meeting also featured a presentation from Harvard about transportation improvements to be included in the master plan, as well as an analysis about the impact the projects, if approved and built, will have on traffic.
 
According to Casey, the traffic in the Barry’s Corner area is likely to be “worse” in 2022 if Harvard’s plan is not implemented than if its proposed development is carried out. The former scenario accounts for the construction of other, already-approved projects when predicting future traffic trends in the case that the master plan is not approved and implemented. Allston-Brighton residents have previously raised concerns about the impact Harvard’s construction will have on traffic in the neighborhood.
 
The task force’s next scheduled meeting is slated for Aug. 14 at the Harvard Innovation Lab. Tim McHale, a Brighton resident and member of the task force, said after the meeting that the task force is discussing the possibility of scheduling another meeting prior to that date. The meeting would be exclusively for members of the community and the task force, as residents asked for at the task force’s meeting on July 1.

A month after opening its doors, Yogurtland, the newest entrant into Harvard Square’s crowded frozen yogurt landscape, is hoping that its self-service model will lure in customers looking for relief from the blazing summer heat.
 
So far, employees say, the strategy is working. The new business is "doing very well—every day, better and better," said Peter Vamvakas, operations manager for the franchise’s Boston-area market.
 
The new store, located at 57 JFK St. and facing Winthrop Square, held its grand opening on June 27 after serving its first customers on June 17. The shop is now swirling 16 unique flavors and serving dozens of available toppings from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until midnight on Friday and Saturday.
 
Vamvakas said he believes the company’s self-service model, which allows customers to serve themselves their yogurt from machines, is "one of the big differences" between Yogurtland and its competitors in the Square.
 
Though plain tart remains the crowd favorite, Yogurtland's machines offer rich flavors like dutch chocolate and New York cheesecake—Vamvakas's favorites—as well as lighter options like guava grapefruit sorbet. Customers can also expect promotional events throughout the year, such as free offerings on National Frozen Yogurt Day, according to Larry Sidoti, vice president of development at Yogurtland.
 
Sidoti said bringing a Yogurtland to Harvard Square "was an easy decision for us." Vamvakas agrees, calling the Square an "excellent location" for the business. The new yogurt shop is part of a larger effort by the company to open about 20 storefronts in the greater Boston area.
 
Here at Flyby, we love our frozen yogurt. With the addition of Yogurtland to the mix, our summer staff will review the Square’s froyo options, pitting them against each other in sugary combat. Check back tomorrow for our first installment of the Froyo Throwdown series.
