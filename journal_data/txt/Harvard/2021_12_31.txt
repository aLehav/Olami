After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine songs. They won’t change your life, but if you had 31 minutes and 19 seconds left to live, it might be worth waving goodbye to your family and listening to this album.
The insanely anticipated album by Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak was supposed to be the album of the summer but was unfortunately delayed — but now it’s here, and it’s better late than never. Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak are a duo listeners never asked for but absolutely needed. Mars’ voice has the smoothness of a silk scarf, while Paak’s is like the sweet sparkle of a nice glass of champagne.
Both artists have had their fair share of commercial success, with a combined total of 34 Grammy nominations and 15 wins, but within their own musical realms. Anderson .Paak has always been known for his unbelievable musical versatility and unique sound, but I had never really seen Bruno Mars as more than an incredibly talented singer with a knack for making mainstream radio hits.
The combination of the two, however, have produced some of the most fun tracks of the year. This album is a complete throwback to the ‘70s with the help of Bootsy Collins’ and Thundercat’s funky bass lines. They know that they have perfectly captured the nostalgic sound of the ’70s and make sure that the audience knows it too, milking their incredible vocal range and stylistic versatility while delivering often hilarious and fun lines.
The first track already lures the listener in with the glamorous ‘70s sound that they so effortlessly and masterfully showcase with their vocals and instruments — an absolutely perfect hint at the sound of the album. Not to mention Bootsy Collins’ smooth voice that just perfectly immerses listeners in their gorgeous sound. “Leave The Door Open,” their first single that shocked the world, is the soulful and euphoric opening song that makes it clear that this album is not messing around when it comes to being smooth. Their voices are only complemented by how they boast their lavish lifestyle, making their humorous lyrics just a little more fun.
“After Last Night” dims the lights and lights the candles. This song is a concoction of sexy vocals and instrumentals, especially the subtle electric guitar that intoxicates listeners, especially with the key change near the end of the song. For their next song “Smokin Out The Window,” they turn the lights back on but step into the back of a Mercedes Benz and roll down the windows. Here, .Paak delivers some hilarious lines like “Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die” and “I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets.” Only .Paak can make these ridiculous lines sound that good.
The best song of the album has to be “Put On A Smile,” the only somewhat melancholic song of the bunch, but it still has me grinning throughout. Mars goes absolutely crazy with the vocals, especially in the last chorus, showing off his insane falsetto over constantly changing keys and some juicy chords like the C7sus4(b9). However, it is followed by two of the weaker tracks on the album: “777” and “Blast Off.” These two often just feel like a lesser version of other tracks like “Fly As Me” and “Leave The Door Open,” and in an album with only eight complete songs, two misses feel like a lot. That being said, they are not necessarily bad tracks; they are just not on par with the rest of the album.
All in all, this album is just so incredibly fun. Is there any deep meaning behind the album? No. Is it meant to be taken seriously and considered a revolutionary album? No, and reading into the album further than just fun and criticizing it for its lack of meaning is a waste of everyone’s time. It is a prime example of a couple unimaginably talented musicians getting together and jamming out and making fun music that they like. Does it really get any better than that?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Baroque’s annual Handel’s “Messiah” concert took place at GBH's Calderwood Studio on Dec. 12. Composer Martin Pearlman’s Grammy-nominated holiday performance featured oloists Maya Kherani, Christopher Lowrey, Aaron Sheehan, and Kevin Deas for a joyful celebration of choral music.
From the moment he stepped out onto the stage, Pearlman took advantage of the intimate acoustics of the recording stage at Calderwood, highlighting the instrumental and solo movements in Part I. When it was time for the chorus to rise, the quiet low registers smoothly facilitated the transition. Pearlman’s unique interpretation featured a mixed voice set, dispersing alto-tenor and bass-soprano placements and thereby unifying the chorus into one voice. He held out on splitting the voices until later songs like “For unto us,” where the altos served as the bass line to the sopranos in their arpeggio runs. The staccato runs characteristic of mass choral music were present throughout, starting with the sopranos and reverberating through the basses. These magical moments really shone in the large-scale pieces like “Hallelujah” and “Worthy is the Lamb.”
Just like Pearlman built up the polyphony in the choir, he immersed the audience in the baroque music by building up the melody from a singular instrument to the entire orchestra.
A master of multitasking, Pearlman also sat down to play the harpsichord, initiating a game of call and response with the trilling violins in “Overture.” He also multiplied the polyphony in the orchestra, skillfully conducting the complex fugue-like variations on a theme in songs like “And with his stripes we are healed.” Staying true to the spirit of baroque, Pearlman kept the violins busy, relying on the cello for deeper, foundational beats. The period instrumentation made the melody a transformative experience of its own, melancholy in the minor keys and joy in the tremolos, and all the silent moments in between were so full of meaning that the audience could only hold their breath in anticipation. By facilitating the tenuous balance of all of the moving parts, Pearlman brought “Messiah” to life and made it his own by putting the baroque orchestra into direct conversation with the chorus.
Having set up the accompanying parts of the orchestra and chorus, Pearlman gave the soloists the platform to truly shine.
Tenor Aaron Sheehan was first to take the stage. He riffed off the modulating strings in “Every valley shall be exalted” and “But thou didst not leave his soul in hell.” Sheehan narrated the intrigue, embodying the tension in “the coming judgement” and “Christ’s Death and Resurrection” movements. Pearlman played on this storytelling, combining the incessant warning of “All we like sheep have gone astray” in the forlorn duet chorus as well as the galloping allegro forte in the cellos. Likewise, the deep notes of bass-baritone Kevin Deas highlighted the impending gravity of songs like “For behold, darkness shall cover the earth.” Deas was loud and intense like the fortissimo music in “Why do the nations so furiously rage together,” and then hopeful and evocative in the “The Day of Judgement” movement, voicing the road to salvation through faith. In these moments, the strings took the backseat, only serving as a backdrop to accent the echoing beats for the pivotal narrative moments. The orchestra also dedicated this movement to celebrating trumpet soloist Jesse Levine. He came out to Deas’ call “The trumpet shall sound,” and indeed, it sounded triumphant like the hopeful message in Dean’s solo, eliciting standing ovations from the audience, performers, and Pearlman alike.
Soprano Maya Kherani came out last, stunning in her red ensemble, her expressive, bell-like vocals sparkling brighter than her jewels. She demanded attention from the start, her Arioso showcasing an impressive ability to glide in and out of diminuendos. Her stable vibrato complemented the chorus, keeping the prolonged notes melodical as she graced the crowd with her dazzling smile.
Although every soloist held their own, the master of “Messiah”’s emotional oration had to be countertenor Christopher Lowrey. Lowrey capitalized on the linguistics in his solos, like in “Christ's Passion” movement, where the phrase “He was despised and rejected of men” was sung as breathy ejectives. This wordplay was accompanied by an equally passionate theatrical performance on Lowrey’s part, maintaining eye contact with the audience and the appearance of scorn. This dramatic interpretation was almost as impressive as Lowrey’s unique voice, which had a rare mezzo-soprano quality that stood out from the rest.
Nothing says holiday like revisiting a timeless tradition. Boston Baroque’s “Messiah” is both conservative of baroque qualities as well as innovative in Pearlman’s conducting, and it makes for an entertaining spin on Handel’s tradition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of “House of Gucci,” protagonist Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) coyly says to Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), “I want to see how this story goes.” This “story” — their love story — drives the plot of the film, and evolves from this pivotal moment into a rollercoaster of euphoric love, cutting betrayal, and intense power struggles.
Ridley Scott’s biographical drama is based on Sara Gay Forden’s 2001 book “The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed.” Patrizia, an ambitious outsider from humble roots, marries into the famous Gucci dynasty — a name “synonymous with wealth,” as she puts it in the opening narration. The film reveals how Patrizia and Maurizio’s mutual desire for power over the fashion house complicates their marriage. At 154 minutes, the film is an engrossing, if slowly paced, depiction of the chaotic intersection between family and business. Though featuring an ensemble cast of greats like Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino, it is Lady Gaga’s magnetic performance as the power hungry Patrizia that stands out and offsets some of the film’s flaws in pacing and character development.
Patrizia and Maurizio first meet at a glamorous party in 1970s Milan, where she arrives as her friend’s plus one and he was personally invited by the host. Dancing under strobe lights, Lady Gaga and Driver have an immediate natural chemistry that continues to anchor the film as their romance unfolds. They easily feed off each other’s charisma, especially in scenes depicting the honeymoon phase of their relationship. Patrizia lovingly stuffs a street vendor sandwich in Maurizio’s face or pulls him fully clothed into the bath with her: awkward yet strangely endearing moments that charm audiences and allow them to buy into their love story. This makes it all the more dramatic when their marriage begins to unravel, leading up to an unexpected — though dragged-out — ending.
The tension between the couple stems from Patrizia’s attempts to manipulate Gucci family members so that Maurizio can control the company. Al Pacino, of course, fits in seamlessly as Aldo, Maurizio’s uncle who owns part of Gucci and wants to maximize profits even if it costs the brand its integrity. His son Paolo, played by an unrecognizable Jared Leto, is the joke of the family, never taken seriously and constantly on the receiving end of insults. With Leto’s hokey Italian accent and played-up goofy mannerisms, he imbues the film with an appreciated sense of levity but ultimately makes Paolo into more of a caricature than a real person.
The film gets a bit lost in its portrayals of complicated business deals and legal troubles, many of which aren’t thoroughly explained or entirely necessary to the plot — some of the infighting at Gucci about ownership of shares and copyright is ultimately more confusing than interesting. Nevertheless, the ever-shifting power dynamics within the family are portrayed with discernible authenticity by the superbly talented cast; even when their Italian accents aren’t necessarily believable, their tense or tender interactions resemble that of a real and relatable family.
Lady Gaga, in only her second leading role in a feature film, has proven herself a force to be reckoned with. She is able to command the screen with only her eyes, emoting jealousy, longing, or contempt with her unflinching gaze. Gaga, who put in months of research for this role, told NPR, “I read and looked at everything I could possibly watch to understand her.” With her layered, emotionally charged portrayal of the complicated Patrizia, it’s easy to see how her efforts paid off.
At times funny, at times nerve-racking, “House of Gucci” is a wild ride, especially for those who don’t already know the story of the Gucci family. Compared to his classics like “Alien” or “Thelma and Louise,” it might not be Ridley Scott’s most memorable film, but it’s entertaining nonetheless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Piotr W. Naskrecki, an entomologist at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, visited Mozambique with Edward O. Wilson in 2012, the two came across a column of giant Matabele ants — a type of “vicious predator” with a powerful sting.
“Of course, him being Ed, who has no fear, he picked one up and it, of course, stung him,” Naskrecki said. “And he said that this was the first time in his entire life that he actually had the thought of dropping an ant — he didn’t.”
“That just kind of tells you what kind of person he was,” he added.
Wilson, who taught at Harvard for 46 years and was dubbed “Darwin’s Natural Heir” for his groundbreaking research on evolutionary theory, died on Sunday at age 92. Wilson authored more than 430 scientific papers and won two Pulitzer Prizes as one of the world's leading experts on insects and biodiversity.
After earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Alabama, Wilson received a Ph.D. in entomology from Harvard in 1955. He joined the Harvard faculty the following year and taught at the school for the rest of his career. Wilson continued to lecture even after his official retirement.
In 1955, Wilson married Irene K. Wilson, who died in August. He is survived by their daughter, Catherine I. Gargill.
Throughout his career, Wilson pioneered two new scientific disciplines — island biogeography, a fundamental principle of ecology and conservation biology, and sociobiology, a field that shaped the approach of using biological mechanisms to explain human behavior.
Wilson won Pulitzer Prizes for his 1978 book “On Human Nature,” which offered a biological basis for human culture, and his 1990 work, “The Ants,” which he co-authored with entomologist Bert Hölldobler.
“He was a very meticulous scientist, but he also was a visionary,” said Sarah B. Hrdy ’68, who was mentored by Wilson as a graduate student at Harvard.
Wilson spent his career driven by a passion for discovery, according to Paula J. Ehrlich, the president and chief executive of the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.
“He really was an extraordinary scientist, and he was always pursuing this sheer delight of knowledge,” she said.
As a professor at Harvard, Wilson collaborated with mathematician and ecologist Robert MacArthur to develop the theory of species equilibrium — the concept that the number of species on an island will remain constant. The two published their findings in a 1967 book called “The Theory of Island Biogeography.”
“The book became a real classic,” said Daniel S. Simberloff ’64, a professor at the University of Tennessee who was first introduced to Wilson as a Harvard undergraduate.
Simberloff worked with Wilson to confirm the ideas presented in the book by studying the movement of species on islets in the Florida Keys. After fumigating the insects and arachnids, they found that the islets repopulated with the same total number of organisms.
In 1975, Wilson’s book, “Sociobiology: The New Synthesis,” opened the gates for a new field of biology, while garnering controversy for its assertion that genes shaped human behavior, not only animal behavior.
Ehrlich said that Wilson’s courage “moved him forward” in the face of criticism.
“That sense of assurance is what inevitably allowed him to, with some confidence, weather those storms, until people then finally did do the research and the studies to either prove or disprove his hypotheses or theories,” she said.
Throughout his career, Wilson gained a reputation not only as trailblazing scientist, but also as a teacher and mentor. His ability to communicate science through words in both conversations and lectures enchanted students.
“He had a way of using language that was like poetry,” said Frank J. Sulloway ’69. “And that was part of the magic of his lecturing style.”
Douglas S. Keith ’82, who took Wilson’s introductory biology course as a freshman in 1978, called his lectures “incredible performances” in an email.
“One memory I have is he would always have a new word for us to learn at his lectures,” he wrote. “I feel lucky that I had the opportunity to learn from such a great mind.”
Mark W. Moffett, one of Wilson’s former graduate students, wrote in an email that Wilson guided him throughout a 29-month research trip through 17 countries. Wilson “diligently” responded to each of his snail mail letters, Moffett noted.
“His smart advice and confidence in me made me who I am today,” he wrote.
Corrie S. Moreau, a professor at Cornell University who received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 2007, wrote that her graduate thesis work of reconstructing the first large-scale ant family tree could not have been possible without Wilson’s “encouragement and support.”
“Although technically [he was] already emeritus when I arrived at Harvard, Dr. Wilson agreed to take me on as one of his students, making me his last graduate student,” she wrote.
According to Sulloway, Wilson earned a reputation for supporting his students even after they went on to pursue their own careers — including as “one of the most generous” endorsers of books he was asked to write blurbs for.
“The number of books that he must have blurbed was just astronomical.” Sulloway said. “I could never figure out how he had the time to do that. Every one of the blurbs was like a gem of verbal magic.”
“The blurbs he would provide were just the ones I treasure most in the whole world,” Hrdy said.
After retiring from teaching in 2002, Wilson continued to research, write, and pursue another significant endeavor — preserving the planet’s biodiversity.
“The people who admire him for his work in conservation even outnumber those that know about sociobiology,” Hrdy said.
Wilson and Ehrlich co-founded the Half-Earth Project in 2016, which Erlich calls a movement to “protect half the Earth in order to preserve habitat and safeguard the bulk of biodiversity.”
“Our work embodies the hopes of the greatest naturalist of our time,” she said.
According to Naskrecki, Wilson’s role as both a scholar and a teacher leave expansive legacy.
“I always think of him as somebody who was really, really good at planting seeds in people’s heads,” Naskrecki said. “And in many cases, those seeds blossom into some incredible actions or scientific discoveries.”
“He will be hugely missed by thousands and thousands of people,” he added.
