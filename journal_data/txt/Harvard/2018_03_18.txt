One of Netflix’s newest shows, “Seven Seconds,” is a crime drama presenting the coverup of the death of a young black boy who died as a result of a hit-and-run by a white cop. Loosely based on Russian movie “The Major,” “Seven Seconds” became available to stream on Netflix on Feb. 23. The premise of the show is heavy and immediately intriguing, and succeeds in generating quick interest. However, the absence of gravity in the show’s plot raises doubts as to whether or not the show’s creators are able to do justice to its sensitive nature.
Due to the show’s heavy emphasis on racial tensions and police brutality, it is clear that "Seven Seconds" has to deal with these topics with great care and sensitivity. The series’ pilot episode seems promising in this regard, as it dives head-on into issues of race and does not shy away from difficult moments. When the cop guilty of the hit and run expresses a desire to confess, those who help him cover up his crime tell him that he will be “crucified” for his actions on behalf of Ferguson, Chicago, and other cities in which police brutality sparked widespread backlash and public outrage. The characters of “Seven Seconds” are highly aware of racial and social tensions in American society, and they are all usually aware of the full scope of what their words and actions entail. “Seven Seconds” draws plotlines across themes of discrimination, and while overdone in some scenes, the show possesses a relevance to American societal issues which reinforces the drama and terror of the plot.
“Seven Seconds” relies on subtly dramatic cinematography to engage its audience. Terrifying moments appear with every scene. By filming objects rather than people, certain scenes become chilling due to the object’s connotation: For example, cop Peter Jablonski (Beau Knapp) runs over teenager Brenton Butler (Daykwon Gaines), who was loosely inspired by a true person. In this scene, the camera locks on the back wheel of Butler’s bicycle as it lays on the road, slowly turning. Other poignant moments are punctuated with closeups of inconspicuously but deliberately chosen objects or characters’ slight movements, bolstering the drama already inherent to “Seven Seconds” and setting a tone of uncertainty and anxiety.
The characters of “Seven Seconds” are complex, particularly in that the introduction of each new character brings waves of confusion, distrust, and colossal intrigue. Particularly skillful in their character’s roles are Knapp as Officer Peter Jablonski and Clare-Hope Ashitey as prosecutor K.J. Harper. Knapp conveys Jablonski’s gripping terror after he runs over Benton with a level of aptitude that truly lets Jablonski’s emotions come to life as he grapples with guilt, fear, anguish, and regret. As Harper, Ashitey fully succumbs to her character’s numbness to life. With a striking, believable portrayal of Harper’s experiences, Ashitey is able to create an arresting juxtaposition between the moments in which Harper is emotionless and void of feelings and those in which Harper strangely comes to life.
The “Seven Seconds” pilot conveys the impression that the series will be able to continue to accomplish its task of presenting a story that deftly deals with complicated topics. With rich and perplexing characters, a bold premise, and an adept use of film techniques, “Seven Seconds” has the potential to captivate and hold a wide audience base.

If there ever was a show tailor-made for the women of 2018, it would have to be NBC’s new drama “Good Girls.” Created by writer Jenna Bans (“Desperate Housewives,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal”) and featuring both a majority-female main cast and a majority-female production team, “Good Girls” is one part “Desperate Housewives,” one part “Grey’s Anatomy” (the Meredith and Cristina part), and two parts “Thelma and Louise.” Though its basic premise—three struggling suburban moms rob a grocery store—is a little silly and not entirely believable, the show finds its weight from its grounded depiction of women and the facets of their worlds: their relationships (with men, with their children, with each other), their concerns, and their realities in America today. Bans and her team skillfully navigate these topics, weaving them into the type of binge-worthy drama generally dismissed as “guilty pleasure” or worse—“women’s television.” The show subverts this stereotype with strong, complex female representation. “Girls today can be anything,” begins the pilot’s opening voiceover, spoken by a young girl. And they can be anything—even armed robbers.
The plot follows three suburban moms: Beth Boland (Christina Hendricks), a stereotypical housewife in a loveless marriage; her sister, Annie Marks (Mae Whitman), a young single mom; and their friend Ruby Hill (Retta), a waitress with a strong marriage but a very sick daughter. When faced with financial troubles, the three come together to rob the local grocery store where Annie works. From there, it’s almost immediately apparent that the trio is in over their heads as situations spiral out of control (a gang gets involved, and guns are pointed inside the women’s homes more than once). Despite the craziness of the robbery plot, the personal trials and relationships of these three mommy-robbers quickly eclipse it.
Hendricks and Retta both give strong performances (Hendricks especially is stellar) in the pilot’s intense cliffhanger ending, Retta in moments of intimacy with her husband and daughter), but it is Mae Whitman who really steals the spotlight in this first episode. Whitman plays Annie with nuance and versatility, breathing life into an otherwise unlikable, fairly one-dimensional character. In so many scenes, Annie is what you’d expect her to be: the immature, irresponsible little sister, a teen mother with a “tramp stamp” who never really grew up. She seems to be all bravado and impulsivity, talking back at work and spending thousands of dollars of the stolen money on fancy things without consulting the others. But all this recklessness and attitude just emphasizes the impact of Annie’s softer moments when worrying about her daughter (a girl “who enjoys a jaunty bow tie” and is bullied in school) or her sister. Most notably, over the course of the episode, Annie is raped, a traumatic and still all too common violation in today’s world. Here, in a masterful performance by Whitman, Annie is vulnerable and young and terrified, but not helpless nor diminished.
Much of “Good Girls” has this same sharp awareness of the difficulties of life as an American woman. “We’ve finally broken that glass ceiling and wow, it sure looks good from the top,” continues the opening voiceover, juxtaposed with scenes of the unfulfilled, underappreciated Beth preparing her family for the day. Although the show is constantly aware of, and subtly commenting on, the places where modern feminism (and society) falls short, it also shines a light on the beauty and tenderness of female friendship. These women face issues of financial hardship, sexual assault, illness, and infidelity, among others, but they also hunt for caramel bugles at the store. They love “The Bachelorette.” They take care of each other, comfort each other, yell at each other (when necessary). In a world full of men who almost universally treat them badly, women aren’t just “good girls”—they’re the good guys.
It’s not that “Good Girls” purports to be “feminism goals.” It doesn’t. In fact, much of the show’s power lies in the fact that it is not trying to be anything other than what it is: a story by women, about women, for women, presenting the issues that women face in a format commonly connected to women (often with a negative connotation). “Good Girls” makes an impact because the show, like the women who star in it, is both strong and sensitive, covering big issues and personal tragedies with equal vigor and respect.
With its exhilarating, somewhat unbelievable plot and strong female characters (and killer female vocalist-driven soundtrack), “Good Girls” is a near-perfect show for its time and its target demographic, striking a careful balance between feminist media and pure wine-night entertainment. Against this wild robbery backdrop, it shows mothers as they are day-to-day, trying their best to raise the next generation of women while navigating their own challenges, doing what they have to do to ensure their best chance at life, liberty, and the pursuit of $30,000.

Volunteerism at Harvard confuses me. On the one hand, I’m moved by the hundreds of Harvard students who so readily dedicate themselves to bettering the lives of others. The Phillips Brooks House Association represents the best aspects of Harvard, serving as a conduit for public service as well as a bridge between Harvard, Cambridge, and the Greater Boston community.
Yet I’m skeptical of how much good organizations like the PBHA can do. Most PBHA programs lack a quantitative analysis of their impacts; in other words, we have no idea how much long-term good (if any) they generate. But more importantly, PBHA seems focused on pushing Harvard students to volunteer their time instead of encouraging them to offer their most valuable resource to those in need—their money. The world would be much better off if well-to-do students pledged to give 15 percent of their summer or future full-time incomes to an effective charity, like Doctors Without Borders or the Against Malaria Foundation, instead of spending their summers volunteering at a foreign orphanage where their inexperience may harm—not bolster—the orphanage’s capacity for good.
We, the part-time volunteers that comprise Harvard’s charitable organizations, live contradictory lives. We spend our dinners railing against global inequality. We spend our afternoons volunteering to address these inequalities. We spend our vacations attempting to convince our friends and family members and even online strangers of the existence of these inequalities. And yet, more than any other demographic, we embody these inequalities.
Materialism and cognitive dissonance: These are Harvard’s hallmarks. We spend our money on needlessly expensive arctic jackets. We buy shoes we rarely wear (and certainly don’t need). We drink overrated coffee, shop at overpriced grocery stores, and subscribe to a horde of services we seldom need or use. Simply put, our student body represents America’s inequality at its finest.
My disdain for civilian excess is partly the Army’s fault. Uncle Sam’s short temper taught me to pack practically and forced me to distinguish between my material waste and the few possessions I need and love. My distaste for materialism is also partly the fault of my Salvadoran mother, who never let an opportunity pass to remind me of my American privilege. I never hid in a basement for days on end waiting for the government shelling to stop. I did not spend my childhood fleeing communist guerrillas or state-sponsored death squads. I never endured siege-induced hunger, and, more likely than not, neither did you.
And that’s exactly the point; by virtue of reading this at Harvard on your personal computer, you are incredibly wealthy relative to so many others. I am not denouncing your wealth or asking you to feel ashamed; guilt is a worthless emotion that does nothing to help those in need. What I am asking you is to consider how much good your money could do. Your money could make the difference in Eastern Ghouta as Doctors Without Borders runs desperately low on medical equipment. Your money could help Give Directly stimulate East African business. Your money could support Give Well, an organization that researches, rates, and funds the world’s most effective charities. Where your money goes is more than a matter of budgeting—in some cases, it’s a matter of life or death.
This is not to vindicate those who shield their selfish pursuits behind the banner of “Earning to Give.” Donating a few million dollars to an underperforming school does no good if your investment bank helped create Mexico’s worst housing crisis or your company supplies Saudi Arabia with missiles to decimate Yemeni villages. A donation isn’t a secular indulgence with which you can balance against your continued wrongdoings. How you make your money is just as—if not more—important as how you decide to spend it.
I’m not asking that you pursue an ascetic life of religious isolation. Buy that concert ticket. Go on that spontaneous weekend trip to New York. Forge the treasured memories that make life worth living. However, as summer approaches with its paid internships or, in the case of the Class of 2018, full-time work, consider how much good your money could do in the right hands. Instead of giving to the Senior Gift, find an effective charity. Donate anonymously. Save a life. Make an impact that actually matters.
We are frequently told to live within our means. Yet if humanity is to overcome climate change, disease, and global poverty, the privileged of our generation must not just live within our means—we must also live beneath them. Don’t just share articles decrying the rise of global economic inequality; use your own wealth to help those in need. Don’t just rave about the lack of social progress on Facebook; pledge to do something helpful with your money instead.
Ultimately, true goodness isn’t a matter of reading the right book, giving a few hours to a local nonprofit, or publicizing your “wokeness” on social media. Your moral status (or lack of) simply comes down to where your money comes from and where you spend it. So the next time you find yourself questioning whether you’ve lived a moral life, open up your checkbook. The numbers won’t lie.

Boston’s urban planning agency approved Harvard’s preliminary proposal for a portion of its “Enterprise Research Campus,” a 36-acre University-owned plot of Allston land Harvard hopes to develop into a hub for entrepreneurship, at a board meeting last week.
Harvard first debuted its proposal for an “enterprise research campus” in 2011. The University hired real estate agent Steven D. Fessler to lead the construction of the area in April 2016. In Dec. 2017, Harvard officially filed a Planned Development Area Master Plan with the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
The plan the BPDA approved last week describes the development goals and intended uses for a particular 14.1-acre portion of the “Enterprise Research Campus,” allocating 400,000 square feet of land for office space, 250,000 square feet for residential space, and room for approximately 800 parking spaces.
In the proposal, University officials wrote Harvard hopes the campus will facilitate a pedestrian- and bike-friendly environment while also promoting sustainable architecture.
The BPDA board voted to approve the plan 4-1 last Thursday evening.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in a press release Friday that BPDA approval represents “the first of many steps” in Harvard’s efforts to develop the campus.
“There will be several future regulatory filings and associated public review,” O’Rourke wrote. “The University will be partnering with third parties for development proposals in the first 14 acres, and that process will provide specific details on the design and programs of individual projects.”
University President Drew G. Faust said in the press release that the University’s plans reflect its “longstanding commitment” to advancing the expansion of knowledge and discovery.
Faust said she hopes the new campus will promote collaboration within the Harvard community as well as with groups off campus.
“We look forward to seeing the ways in which bringing other organizations in close proximity to campus will strengthen the University—and the entire region—in exciting and unexpected ways,” Faust said.
Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said in the press release that the feedback Harvard received from Allston community meetings “informed and strengthened” the University’s goal to of facilitating innovation in the region.
Nonetheless, some state officials and Allston residents say they are concerned by Harvard’s newly approved plans.
Boston City Councilor Mark Ciommo and state representatives Kevin G. Honan and Michael J. Moran wrote a letter to BPDA board members last Thursday, the same day as the vote, urging them to “go on the record in opposition” to Harvard’s plan for the enterprise research campus.
The officials wrote they believed there was “insufficient consensus” in the Allston community. Ciommo, Honan, and Moran called on Harvard to “further discuss and resolve outstanding issues” with local residents before forging ahead.
Allstonian Max Rome said he believes the officials’ letter had a “big impact” on the BPDA board. But he said he thinks Harvard’s plans had too much momentum going into the vote.
“It’s just incredibly difficult to slow down a project that has so much momentum behind it. I think by the time a project comes to the board, unless there’s something really egregiously wrong about it, the path of least resistance is to definitely move forward,” he said.
Across the past month, Allstonians have spoken out against what they call a dearth of affordable housing and green spaces in Harvard’s plans.
In an email Friday, Allstonian Harry E. Mattison wrote he continues to question Harvard’s plans to promote sustainability. He specifically mentioned Harvard’s plans to introduce approximately 800 new parking spaces.
"Are Harvard's existing 4,000 parking spaces in Allston not enough?” he wrote. “It is too bad that Harvard's ambitious environmental goals apparently don't apply to how people will commute to its Enterprise Research Campus.”
Other residents, including Troy Brogan, noted that Harvard’s developmental plans are still in the preliminary stages. Brogan said he thinks there are still opportunities for Harvard to introduce “innovative” housing policies later in the process.
“We’re fortunate to have Harvard as the entity developing it,” Brogan said. “They have such a great track record so far in both Cambridge and Boston, there’s a lot of reason for optimism that it will exceed expectations and be a great project.”
O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement Friday that the University anticipates working further with Allston residents to “advance many of the commitments the community requested.”
“We look forward to continuing our discussions with the community and the city, and to working towards a shared vision for a vibrant, welcoming, inclusive Allston,” she wrote.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health suspended marijuana sales at Healthy Pharms Inc., a registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary with a location in Harvard Square, after a pesticide was discovered in a store sample in February.
The department suspended sales on Feb. 23. Three days later, department officials released a statement attributing the suspension to “a failed lab test report that indicated the presence of the pesticide bifenthrin in a sample batch of product.”
Healthy Pharms has closed both its Harvard Square and Georgetown locations until further notice, according to a statement posted on its website.
Bifenthrin is a man-made insecticide farmers sometimes use to weed out fire ants and other crop-killing insects. Given its high toxicity to insects—but not to humans—many companies use bifenthrin in food products.
No marijuana was directly sprayed with the pesticide, according to Healthy Pharms's statement. Rather, employees sprayed a solution containing bifenthrin on an area without plants.
“This inadvertently contaminated a sprayer that we only use to sanitize hard surfaces between batches of plants,” the statement reads. “When we re-planted a flower room, the harvest of cannabis from that room was tainted.”
Complying with state regulations, the company self-reported the discovery to the Department of Public Health, according to the statement. Though Healthy Pharms found traces of this pesticide in certain samples, none of the affected batches of medical marijuana were packaged or distributed to consumers, the statement reads.
Healthy Pharms is a newcomer to Harvard Square. The firm, based in Georgetown, Mass, was the first of “five or six” medical marijuana dispensaries permitted to set up shop under modified zoning regulations set by the Cambridge City Council in Feb. 2017. Healthy Pharms opened for business at its 98 Winthrop St. location. on Dec. 30.
A Healthy Pharms spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.
The suspension comes a few months after some Cambridge residents and store owners alleged Healthy Pharms would likely have a negative affect on Harvard Square. One local businessman, Crimson Galeria owner Raj K. Dhanda, even filed a lawsuit in Sept. 2017 seeking to block the dispensary from opening its Cambridge location. His lawsuit is still ongoing.
Dhanda declined to comment directly on the suspension of Healthy Pharms’s license Saturday. But he said the event has not affected his lawsuit.
“There is nothing in our situation that has changed,” he said.

UPDATED: March 18, 2018, at 10:21 p.m.
Junior Ryan Donato of the Harvard men’s hockey team put an end to discussions about his career on Sunday night, announcing that he will be departing from the Crimson to join the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. Donato was a Bruins draft pick (second round, 56th overall) in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.
"While I am beyond thrilled for this next opportunity, it comes with a bittersweet feeling, as my time as a student-athlete at Harvard comes to a close,” said Donato in a press release. “I am so thankful for every day I have spent at Harvard and the remarkable people I have met along the way, from the classroom, to the ice, and beyond. It has truly been a privilege to wear the Harvard jersey and represent my school alongside such incredible teammates and coaches.”
Donato’s third college season was his coming-out party on the national stage. The Hobey Baker finalist led Harvard in points this season (29 GP, 26–17—43), and his 26 goals were good for 4th in the country. He led the NCAA in goals per game (0.90) at the end of the regular season, and finishes his career with the Crimson above a point per game (97 career GP, 60–44—104). He was also named 2017-18 ECAC Player of the Year, and nabbed the Ivy League Player of the Year in last year’s Frozen Four campaign.
Harvard finished its season with an overtime loss on Friday in the ECAC semifinals to No. 10/8 Clarkson. The Crimson’s fourth consecutive trip to Lake Placid, N.Y., was in no small part due to Donato’s dynamic offensive play. In Game 3 of the best-of-three quarterfinal series versus Dartmouth, Harvard came away with a 4-2 win powered by a hat trick from Donato. That matchup marked the third time the junior notched three goals in a game this season and gave him his fifth career hat trick.
Donato didn’t just shine on college ice. The junior joined Team USA at the Winter Olympics last month as one of four NCAA players selected to the final roster. In Pyeongchang, he paced the squad in points (5 GP, 5–1—6) and notched more goals than his father, Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91, did during his stint at the Games.
Donato, a sociology concentrator, said that he remains “fully dedicated” to completing his degree. Aside from his education, the decision to depart was certainly complicated by the fact that his bench boss with the Crimson was his father. Ryan’s younger brother, freshman Jack Donato, is also a forward on the Harvard team.
For now, though, the books and the Crimson will both take a back seat. Donato’s entry-level contract kicks in just in time for the Bruins’ Monday night tilt against the Columbus Blue Jackets. After three years of Beanpot tournaments, Donato will skate under the bright lights of TD Garden again—this time, sporting the black and gold B.

If you’ve ever been to a Harvard party—yes, those do exist—you’ve probably met at least one of these party personalities. If you haven’t, then it’s probably you.
The winggirl/wingman
Even with some liquid courage, most of us are still too shy to approach that cute person we’ve been eyeing across the room. After all, we all fall somewhere on the socially awkward spectrum. The winggirl/wingman is well versed in the practice of extolling your many (or limited) virtues and knows that their job isn’t complete until you are heading out the door for some “Tasty Burger.”
The guy that’s trying too hard
	
You know who we're talking about. You’re at a party just trying to have a good time, and some guy just inserts himself into the circle. As a collective whole, you and your friends relocate. But this mans is persistent. Next thing you know, he’s back making eyes at you. And when he finally gets the hint, he starts making moves on your friends. How many places can a group relocate in a tiny dorm?!
The designated c*ckblock
We’ve all been there. Someone gets a little too close for comfort and we start to panic. Well, that’s what the designated CB is for. When we need them the most, they slide right in between us and the offender. The designated CB personality comes in multiple forms—it is also the friend you implore to keep you from making bad decisions that you will end up making anyway. In this way, the designated CB will try to keep you away from the target, be it a Bumble date or Burnette's bottle, but their success may vary.
The girl that’s just waiting for her friends to finish making fools of themselves so she can get El Jefe’s
Okay, there’s something to be said for a good party. But have you ever had a cheese quesadilla from El Jefe’s? Or better yet, have you ever had a cheese quesadilla from El Jefe’s at 2 a.m.? This girl is dying inside watching her friends engage in questionable behavior, but she knows that if she can stay strong, it’ll all be worth it in the end.
The mom friend/dad friend
While there is no need for a designated driver, the long walk back from the Quad can be treacherous. I think it’s safe to say that if not for the parent friend, there is a very real possibility of being lost in the Quad, never to return. On top of their navigational responsibilities, the parent friend is the friend that will keep your thirst under control—making sure that you both get plenty of water and aren't coming on too strong.
The one just tryna forget their problems
Whether it’s three psets that were due last week or the stupid guy that just won’t text back, where better to evade your problems than at a party? Or more accurately, where better to create bigger problems instead? This person will look like they’re having the time of their life, but when you spend 12 hours Monday through Friday on the grind, watching paint dry could qualify as a good time.
The one that’s GONE
"I did what at the party?"
As the "warmer" weather of spring approaches, the campus party drive grows stronger and these personalities come out to play. Make sure to look out for them during your next rendezvous, so you know who to keep track of (the one that's gone) and who to ask to hold your hair back (the mom friend).
