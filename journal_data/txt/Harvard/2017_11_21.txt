After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators come and go on Harvard’s campus, and while each brings some new change or development to the University as a whole, few have the chance to see the breadth of change and help to impact the lives of the student body as Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who announced he would be stepping down last week.
Dean Dingman has served the College faithfully for many decades, but the work he has done during the 13 years he has spent at the helm of the Freshman Dean’s Office has helped transform the first-year experience. His actions have wrought positive changes that have positively benefited numerous freshmen, including the “Reflecting On Your Life” group sessions and a focus on matching incoming students with compatible roommates.
In addition, he helped to implement or bolster many pre-orientation programs, including spearheading the newly-announced bridge program for low-income and first generation students, after months of controversy and debate surrounding it. Many students have spoken positively of Dingman’s effect on their experiences, having recently matriculated, and it is clear that the dean has contributed to inclusion and belonging on our campus. We are grateful to him for all he has done.
We hope the next Dean of Freshmen will continue Dingman’s commitment to making sure every freshman gets a transformative first-year experience. Some ways in which we hope to see this is by the prioritization of the aforementioned bridge program, and by the Freshman Dean’s Office working with the Undergraduate Council to move forward on policies regarding social spaces for first-years. We also hope the Dean and the FDO continue soliciting student feedback and have actionable responses that take into account students’ needs and concerns.
In addition, Dingman’s notable transition on Harvard’s social group policy just a few weeks ago, during deliberations on the faculty motion to reverse the sanctions, shows a deep, incisive reflection on the state of the clubs on the undergraduate experience. Dingman was a member of the Delphic as a student here, and given this role, we are glad to hear his criticism of the clubs’ current behavior.
We’ll be sad to see Dingman go—he has been an uncommonly kind and dedicated figure, and a hallmark of many of our freshman years. For all of us, Dingman, clad in his signature red jacket, occasionally joining us for meals in Annenberg, will forever remain a part of our memory as first-year students. We wish good old Tommy D.—as he is affectionately known among freshmen—and his successor the very best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Game 6 of the 2017 Eastern Conference Semifinals of the National Hockey League, and the Washington Capitals are playing the Pittsburgh Penguins. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby has just made a miraculous recovery from a concussion—to some, a suspiciously quick one, considering Crosby’s concussion history—in about a week. And then, in only the first period of the game, Crosby gets twisted up with Capitals defenseman John Carlson and goalie Braden Holtby. The collision takes Crosby headfirst into the boards. He’s slow to get up. But he gets back on the bench; he isn’t pulled aside by the NHL’s concussion spotters for evaluation. The league’s Deputy Commissioner has an answer as to why.
“‘Ice’ has been found to be a predictor of concussions—‘boards’ has not been.”
Of course, fans and experts were dismayed by the sheer ridiculousness of Daly’s statement. Chris Nowinski of the Concussion Legacy Foundation dismissed that excuse, saying, “Any head contact is a possible mechanism of injury. I can't believe we have to say that in 2017.”
That incident isn’t the only example of leagues overlooking the safety of their players. Despite growing concern over the health implications of head contact, the National Football League has a history of denying the link between football and CTE—a degenerative brain disease that begins with aggression, paranoia, and depression, and develops into memory loss or even progressive dementia. Players are pressured to return from injury quickly, when their coaching staff needs them back in the lineup, reflecting the league administration’s close-minded views about head trauma.
Sports that are commonly thought of as “non-contact” are no exception to this danger; soccer, for instance, can cause brain damage—most frequently when a player hits the ball with their head. This open secret manifests itself in lawsuits and disagreements within league administration. Unsealed emails from 2009 revealed National Hockey League officials joking about “tree huggin, never played sport, leftist doctors…that soon won’t let us climb stairs for fear of concussion...”
The first step in solving these issues is putting the right people in charge of them. The NHL, for instance, has a habit of putting former players known for their physicality in charge of the Department of Player Safety. This year’s new appointee was George Parros, an ex-enforcer—someone who made his name on the ice by fighting—who is also known for his stance that hockey should be violent. A good candidate for director of player safety should know what it’s like to be targeted on a nightly basis and never underestimate the danger of head injury. Ideally, there should be at least one person in charge of player safety who has faced the health implications of head trauma themselves. However, the one-off appointees who do good for player safety can’t be just one-offs. There’s a larger culture change that needs to take place.
What really makes certain sports dangerous to play is the aggressive, often-reckless mentality that every athlete is taught to cultivate. And we’re all complicit in that. If a player fights through injury to finish a game, we celebrate them. We praise them for their resilience, their dedication, their toughness. We, as a society, nurture a sports culture which demands that athletes make physical sacrifices that have far-reaching, often lifelong consequences for them. We expect them to play roughly against their opponents, even in ostensibly “non-contact” sports. It’s really no wonder that administrative officials don’t value medical advice or player safety as much as they should. We teach them that’s okay.
A common counterargument is that injuries come with the job for athletes in strenuous, physical sports; that’s what they’re earning so much money. (Well, first of all, head trauma affects players who aren’t being paid whatsoever, in sports with rules against physical play.) It’s understandable that there’s fear in admitting something you follow can be fatally injurious for the athletes you love.
However, the debate about safety in professional sports is happening in a vacuum. Sports like football are seeing declining participation at high school levels—a decline not unrelated to worries about concussions and health issues. One can’t blame concerned parents who take their children out of contact sports when research suggests that even youth football can cause problems later on in life.
Player safety goes far beyond the athletes on the professional stage, right now. It affects every fan, and every middle-school player’s dreams. And looking at the state of things, player safety could change the very future of the games we love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past October, a New Jersey teacher was caught lashing out at one of her students for talking in Spanish. Upon realizing the language of a student’s conversation with a friend, she began yelling at her to “speak American.” Assuming that speaking English was the only way to be “American,” the teacher shamed the student, claiming that “soldiers were fighting” for this so-called mandate of being American. The boy stormed off, fed up. The classroom erupted—ballooning in exasperation. It required no translation.
In telling that student that the language her family spoke was not one that our country’s troops fight for, she undermined the reputation of our country as a solace for immigrants to pursue their American dream with nothing more than empty pockets and dedication. Instead, her charged response spoke to a larger tension—a fear of immigrants and their foreign languages being protected as equally as English-speaking Americans. Rather than allow that thought to burrow and take root, she chose to share with her classroom a xenophobia that has been rising as a new norm in society.
Fear was what took a seat in that classroom that day, demanding as much attention as little ‘ol things that normally occupied space there, like education, value-instillment, and individual growth. In spewing such negative—not to mention factually incorrect—rhetoric, this English teacher tried to caricature Americanism as not only a culture but apparently a language as well. She gave fear a podium to speak from.
Given that xenophobia (safeguarded through the “violent immigrant” trope) is being normalized more so than ever before with the current administration, the teacher must have felt that her response was warranted—acceptable even. The psychological impact of a Trump administration, in bringing crippling anxiety to Americans through policies undermining or attacking their identities, was shown to be well under way and finding a vessel through the teacher’s aplomb in speaking her mind. This type of rhetoric, however, is the exact opposite of what we need to be instilling in today’s youth through education.
As the sole source of authority in the classroom, a teacher has a disproportionate amount of power in swaying the perception of her students on a topic, particularly in regards to history and current events. Her words have the potential to shape the way students interact with one another, as their implicit biases force students to become tokenized, representatives of their ethnic groups for the class at large. In a diverse school, this could have had an egregious impact: studies have shown that the achievement gap across ethnic groups differs according to a teacher’s prejudiced expectations.
These students proceeded to organize a demonstration, protesting against her rhetoric and proudly waving the flags of their motherlands.  They banded together a diverse set of countries, origins, and tongues to stand against the idea that speaking a language other than English is a threat to America.
Yet it is pitiful that students at this school had to remind others that the prosody of hate is understood in any language, and what makes our country unique is its ethnic and linguistic pluralism. Research has shown that a firm grip on bilingualism points to higher cognitive control and a better cognitive reserve (which, in other words, helps slow the onset of dementia symptoms). On the national scale, research has also proven that immigrants are crucial for certain labor which English is unnecessary for.
Although we have and continue to produce information showing that bilingualism in the classroom is unobtrusive, that the U.S. shouldn’t be a monolingual country, that the immigrant is not a “bad hombre,” the White House continues to belie these facts and try to incite fear that America is becoming a “polyglot boardinghouse”. This thinking is backwards and it is creeping into the next generation.
As many immigrant  families continue to be hurt by the Trump administration, we as a country must remember the facts, lest our youth fall prey to false soundbites from the bully pulpit. And as children of immigrants and minority groups, we must never allow our cultures and our identities to be silenced by groundless stereotypes. “American,” Spanish, or any other language is a part of this country too.

Harvard’s next president will likely keep the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups largely unaltered, Harvard Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 said in an interview last week.
Lee chairs the search committee tasked with selecting Harvard’s 28th president—the successor to current University President Drew G. Faust, who announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018. He said last Thursday he thinks Faust’s replacement will probably continue many of her policies.
“If you think about the number of different policies that have been put in place during Drew's tenure, our expectation is that the new president will have the same set of broad goals in mind, and as a consequence new and better policies might be developed,” Lee said.
He added the next president will likely share what he called Faust's commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive campus.
“It’s very unlikely that they’re going to have a radically different view than we have on things like the single-gender organizations,” Lee said.
The College’s penalties—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships. The sanctions have drawn controversy and criticism since Faust first announced the social group policy in May 2016.
Faust has stood by the penalties, defending them in speeches and in a Crimson op-ed. She does, however, have the power to change the sanctions—she is currently considering a set of recommendations from a Harvard committee that proposed either keeping the sanctions as they are, banning membership in unrecognized groups outright, or considering “some other possible solutions.”
Faust said in November that she may wait until December or later to make a final decision on the future of the College’s social group policy. Regardless of which option she ultimately chooses, Lee said last week he thinks the next president will abide by Faust’s decision.
“It’s likely that the policies she’s put in place will continue,” he said, referring to Faust.
Lee also said members of the Corporation will discuss the College’s social group penalties with the next president in much the same manner they did with Faust. Faust has said she thinks she and the Corporation have ultimate power over the future of undergraduate social life.
“We’ll be consulting with the president the same way we have earlier to help get to the right decision,” Lee said. “And I think it’s a good process.”
In the interview last week, Lee said the presidential search committee is rounding out its “information-gathering phase” and will begin “phase two”—winnowing a list of almost 700 nominated candidates—by the end of December.

In a stark change of pace, the Faculty Council did not discuss the College’s controversial social policy at their biweekly meeting last Wednesday, according to Council member David L. Howell.
This was the first meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest governing body since the November meeting of the full Faculty, where professors voted down a motion intended to counter the policy—130 votes to 90. This vote was the culmination of over a year’s worth of Faculty discussion since the College announced it would begin penalizing members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations.
However, professors will vote on another sanctions-related motion, introduced by Howell, at the December Faculty meeting. It moves that the Faculty recognize that basic rights and freedoms may come into conflict with each other at Harvard, and in these cases “it is the responsibility of the faculty and administration of Harvard College to establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.”
Howell said that the Council did not discuss his motion, which they have discussed previously, at the meeting. Instead, he said the Council discussed “a variety of issues regarding the University as a whole” with Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
They also heard a report from a task force on climate change about the University’s attempt to reduce its fossil fuel usage. Finally, the Council discussed various Master’s programs in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The next meeting of the full Faculty will be held on Tuesday, December 5.

The World’s Only Curious George Store will remain in Harvard Square after reaching a lease agreement with developer Regency Centers, quelling Cantabrigians’ years of anxiety about the future of the landmark store.
The store will remain in its current JFK and Brattle St. corner location until construction begins on the Abbot Building, when the Curious George store will open in a temporary location in another part of the building. The fate of the store dedicated to the famous storybook monkey has been central to local residents’ concerns about the changing  face of Harvard Square as Regency Centers planned renovations of the building.
“As we began speaking to people throughout Cambridge, everyone from Vice Mayor McGovern to the Harvard Square Business Association and the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association let us know that Curious George is truly a store like no other and a key part of the fabric of Harvard Square,” wrote Sam Stiebel, Regency’s vice president of investments, in a press release.
Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said he was “very excited” about the agreement. He has spent months negotiating with the store owners and developers.
“It’s a one-of-a-kind kind of store, and it’s a local business. We certainly see in Harvard Square that as buildings get sold at very high prices and rents increase as a result, it’s harder and harder for local businesses to remain in the Square,” McGovern said.
Adam S. Hirsch, who owns the Curious George store, said that Regency has been “great to work with since day one.”
“From the very beginning, Regency was looking at this property, this opportunity, in a much more community-minded way, and had a broader and much more thoughtful approach to their project,” he said. “We are very grateful and thankful to them for that.”
Over the past few years, Cantabrigians have rallied around keeping Curious George in the Square. After the store closed for one year between 2011 and 2012, residents urged its return, and Hirsch became the store’s new owner when it reopened.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that maintaining the store’s presence in Harvard Square has been a priority for the organization.
“We worked so hard along with the whole City of Cambridge and with Adam Hirsch to bring back Curious George to Harvard Square,” Jillson said. “We are so pleased that Regency has really come forward and has committed themselves to being good community partners.”
More recently, uncertainty again shrouded the future of the Curious George store. In February 2017, an online petition racked up over 5,000 signatures in support of preserving the Curious George store, and City officials met many times to discuss plans for the building.
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and leader of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said she had been actively involved in promoting the online petition and says the lease agreement is “really wonderful news.”
“We’ve been communicating directly with Regency on the importance of this as well as the importance of really strong preservation in how they are remodeling the facade of the Abbot Building,” Blier said. “Part of this is the businesses, but part of it is keeping the architectural flavor of Harvard Square with some of the key historic buildings.”
Hirsh said many have misunderstood discussions about the store’s closing.
“Unfortunately, a lot of people have received misinformation, and they thought we are closed. We are not closed,” he said. “We are not going anywhere anytime soon.”

The Harvard Film Archive recently released its schedule for the upcoming winter season, inviting both award-winning filmmakers and independent artists to present.
Harvard’s Fine Arts Library manages the Harvard Film Archive, which was founded as a repository for film in 1979. The archive screens pictures from across film history a few evenings per week, and invites filmmakers to come present about their work.
Located in the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, course instructors also use the facility to screen films for their students.
Since its inception, this collection has grown to include more than 25,000 titles. Haden Guest, who directs the archive, said the archive has one of the largest university film collections in the world.
This year’s winter program includes a wide variety of filmmakers from around the world. The films encompass a diversity of genres, including a holiday show and other seasonal films, foreign dramas, and experimental documentaries.
One of these experimental documentaries is “Rat Film,” a production about the history of racism, redlining, and urban planning in Baltimore during the 20th century.
“Rat Film” director Theo Anthony said the documentary uses “a rat as an entry point into a conversation about Baltimore’s history and expands out there to larger questions of mapmaking and filmmaking.”
Anthony’s film is part of a recurring series at the film archive known as the “Cinema of Resistance.” This monthly series sets out to screen films that are relevant in today’s political climate and to create a setting for vibrant discussion.
“I don’t think this is your normal social issue documentary that poses a problem and offers a neat solution,” Anthony said about his film. “It’s really cool to see it in this context—it’s definitely a political film—but it goes a lot of places and I’m really excited about it.”
The archive will also screen a film by Jodie Mack, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Her work, “Posthaste Perennial Pattern,” is a collection of short films dealing with fabric.
“These films are kind of in the tradition of what one might call ‘anti-animation,’” Mack said, “so they’re not necessarily using traditional sequencing modes of what one might consider animation.”
Guest said that while the Harvard Film Archive brings award-winning filmmakers to present their works, the archive also invites independent artists to showcase their cinema.
“I’m definitely working in the tradition of independent artist film, which the Harvard Film Archive is known to feature,” Mack said.
Guest said that the archive wants to engage and challenge its audience with the selected films this winter.
“Our challenge and our hope is that someone will come and watch all these different programs and realize all the possibilities of film as an art,” he added.

Though many Harvard students will head home for Thanksgiving break, some plan to stay on campus to relax, catch up on work, and feast on the holiday dinner that Harvard University Dining Services will prepare Thursday evening.
A number of students who chose to stay on campus for Thanksgiving said their hometowns are too far from Cambridge to consider flying home.
“It’s the distance,” said Nathan D. Lee ’21, who said he hails from Hawaii. “A 10 hour flight.”
Lee said he will use Thanksgiving break to spend time with friends who live and go to school in the area. He said he is excited despite being unable to return to Hawaii.
“It’ll be a fun time,” he said.
Samyra C. Miller ’21, who said she is from New Orleans, La., said she will use the break to rest.
“It also might be good to see the campus more intimately without people around and just get to spend time with myself, too,” she said.
For those staying on campus, HUDS will provide Thanksgiving dinner. Dining employees in Adams House will cook the meal, serving turkey and mashed potatoes throughout the afternoon and evening. Crista Martin, the HUDS Director for Strategic Initiatives & Communications, said she is looking forward to the event.
“It’s a fun and busy day, very festive and very relaxed. People are just happy to be there and enjoy the whole scene,” Martin said.
Some students said they can hardly wait for HUDS Thanksgiving dinner.
“I will be the first one at the door. I will bring my own utensils,” Miller said. “I will bring to-go plates. I will pack a to-go plate before I bring my own plate. I’m stocking up.”
For students from even farther afield than Hawaii and New Orleans, the Woodbridge International Society will host events throughout the weekend. The society will designate a table for international students and their friends during Thanksgiving dinner in Adams House and will host a movie outing for these students the day after Thanksgiving.
Esme D. Trahair ’19, who hails from London, England, said she believes this programming helps international students feel at home during the holiday break.
“Thanksgiving is a weird time for international students generally, just because it’s a new holiday that a lot of us don’t really have an equivalent for in our respective countries and then a lot of us don’t end up going home,” she said.
Trahair added she hopes that events planned for the weekend will help international students see that it can be “fun” to be on campus over Thanksgiving break.
Additionally, several international students are coordinating a dinner featuring different cultural foods, slated to take place Saturday night. According to Aditi Chitkara ’21, from Shimla, India, the Woodbridge International Society will be providing groceries for students to prepare and share traditional meals from their respective countries.
Some international students, however, said they are looking forward to just relaxing.
“I really like having the break in the middle of the semester,” said Laura D. Zharmukhametova ’21, who said she hails from Kazakhstan. “It’s nice to have some rest.”
All dining halls except for Adams will close on Tuesday or Wednesday and will stagger reopenings throughout the weekend.

Just days after winning their election, Undergraduate Council President-elect Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President-elect Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said they are ready to hit the ground running and begin working on their 39 campaign proposals.
“The work doesn’t wait until a month from now, until two weeks from now to get started. It gets started right away,” Boucher said.
But first, Boucher, who launched “nova”—an online grant-processing system for the UC—said there are “a couple tech things” that he is working on before they take office next month.
“We just came from a couple UC meetings this morning, so we’re already starting to talk with people, work with administrators,” he said. “But in terms of putting specifics on it, I’d probably hold off and announce each one one by one.”
The duo’s campaign platform proposed solutions to a variety of issues often discussed at Harvard. To improve campus-wide race relations, for example, Zhang and Boucher proposed building a multicultural center. To address sexual assault, they advocated partnering with on-campus mental health services to develop a training module for tutors and proctors.
Zhang added that the UC’s website may also get refurbished under their administration. In addition, their campaign pledged to add progress bars to the UC’s website in order to keep the two accountable on their campaign promises.
“I think for us it’s super important that the Council as a whole is on the same page. We have 39 policies that we want to work on,” she said.
Boucher added that he and Zhang look forward to the year ahead, and plan to make strides on each of their proposals.
“This is a dream come true. This is a reality that two years ago I never could have expected and I personally won't sleep a full night until we’ve done what we said we’re going to do,” he added.
According to Boucher, University President Drew G. Faust reached out to he and Zhang Monday morning, congratulating them on their win. On Thursday night, the two won more than half of the first-choice votes in the UC’s presidential election, beating challengers Victor C. Agbafe ’19, Michael K. Bervell ’19, Conor Healy ’19, and Parth C. Thakker ’18-19.

When Lucy R. Golub ’20 bought a ticket to The Game, she expected to watch the action from the sidelines, not to be tackled to the ground herself.
But as Golub inched her way up towards the front of the line to enter the student tailgate, she could sense the crowd’s impatience building behind her. Heightened security in the form of metal detectors and bag checks had created a bottleneck in the line, leaving many students frustrated. At one point, the tension snapped and people started ”pushing aggressively.”
Golub, who is also an active Crimson magazine editor, found herself in the middle of a stampede.
“People kind of pushed over the metal detectors not fully to the ground but just sort of out of the way and walked completely through security,” she said. “It was kind of a stampede. It was a little scary. I think if security had let in people faster or more streamlined then it could have been a lot better.”
The incident was one of several logistical snafus that students say inconvenienced them during the 134th annual Harvard-Yale football game Saturday. Security measures at the Yale Bowl created long lines, choking off attendance at tailgates and the game before Yale officials ultimately relented on the stricter measures, according to more than a dozen students who attended the annual showdown.
Inquiries about the security measures at The Game on Saturday were redirected to the Yale Office of Public Affairs and Communications, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
According to some students, the heightened security resulted in low attendance for the House Committee tailgates.
“There were a lot fewer people than there were last year,” Caroline M. Kerwin ’18, a member of Dunster HoCo, said. “I heard that changed when they changed security procedures.”
At the tailgate, strict security measures delayed students for hours before guards relented and allowed people to enter without going through security.
Danielle O. Strasburger ’18, co-chair of Winthrop HoCo, said the number of people at the House tailgates was sparse until around noon, when security moved the metal detectors aside and the long lines evaporated.
“At that point we saw a lot more people come through,” Strasburger said. “We had a lot of students come right before the game started around 12:00, 12:15, 12:20 and the tailgates were supposed to end at 12:30 so it was a shorter time frame.”
Even as the game began, students again faced long lines as Yale officials enforced scrutinizing security measures for people entering the Yale Bowl before again abandoning the security protocols entirely.
Multiple people who entered the stadium later said that Yale officials never checked their ticket.
“I don’t think anyone checked my ticket. I just kind of wandered in. They weren’t being super strict or anything like that,” Sebastian A. Schwartz ’20 said.
Some students said the increased security didn’t end at metal detectors. Justin Wu ’19 said he noticed SWAT cars and personnel at the game.
“They were armed with, they weren’t regular, I think they were semi-automatic guns,” Wu said.
Still, many students reported that they enjoyed their Harvard-Yale experience.
“I thought it probably went as smoothly as it could,” Andrew L. Gordon ’18 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two road games down, two straight 73-69 defeats.
After a haphazard performance against Holy Cross on Thursday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team looked to rebound Saturday afternoon against Manhattan College in The Bronx.
Despite significantly reducing its turnover count compared to Thursday’s contest, the Crimson (2-2) suffered from a difficult overall shooting performance and fell just short of a spirited comeback against the Jaspers (2-0).
“Shooting 9-for-30 from three is incredibly disappointing,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We still had opportunities to win the game...I thought they put us in a big hole early and were able to keep the momentum going.”
Notably, Amaker sat out his regular starters during the opening tip-off. Freshman forward Reed Farley was one of Amaker’s selections to start this game, seeing his first action in a Harvard uniform. This decision was merely symbolic, as the Crimson began the second half with its regular five.
“We weren’t pleased with the start we got off against Holy Cross.” Amaker said. “We made some switches to make a point...it is such an privilege and honor to be a starter and we have to adhere to that level and standard.”
Despite this plea for a more invigorating start, the Crimson again fell behind quickly in the first half even with the quick re-entry of leading scorers like sophomores Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns.
Manhattan senior guard Rich Williams and forward Calvin Crawford overwhelmed the Harvard defense in the opening 20 minutes, each sinking 14 points and combining for a perfect six-for-six from beyond the arc.
The Crimson shot just 10-for-32 in the opening frame, and fell to its largest deficit of 18 points with 1:17 left in the half. Freshman forward Danilo Djuricic was a lone bright spot for Harvard in the half, knocking down a pair of threes and finding the rim for two easy layups.
Digging itself into a 40-25 deficit going into halftime, Harvard needed better performances from its core players in the second half. Towns was one such player who was up to the task for the Crimson. The sophomore forward scored 16 points in the latter frame, including the go-ahead three at 9:46 to give Harvard its first lead of the game at 51-50.
A resilient defense was also important in sparking the Harvard run. Between 18:39 and 15:12, the Jaspers were unable to put in a single basket, and struggled defensively to halt the Crimson offense. In the time period, Harvard scored 12 straight points to narrow the deficit to 42-37.
“Certainly that was the reason we were able to make the run we made—we made some threes,” Amaker said. “Corey [Johnson] made a few, Seth made a couple, that allowed us to get on the run. But I think we are a better three-point shooting team than we have displayed thus far.”
The Crimson was able to widen its lead to 59-53 with 6:11 to go, but a slew of fouls proved to be costly. Harvard tallied its seventh foul at 4:48, and five straight free throws brought the score to 62-61.
The teams exchanged points in the final few minutes. With his team down 70-66 with a minute to go, Aiken penetrated into the paint but was met by two defenders. Manhattan sophomore guard Aaron Walker, Jr. successfully wrestled the ball from Aiken’s hands, but after diving for the loose ball, Aiken recovered and got rid of the rock, which eventually fell into the hands of Towns.
Towns capped off the peculiar sequence of events with a three, but this was the last made bucket for the Crimson. Two missed jump shots by Johnson in the final minute concluded the up-and-down performance from Harvard, as it fell again by two baskets at 73-69.
Compared to Thursday’s loss against the Crusaders, the Crimson reduced its turnover count from 22 to 13. However, the team’s shooting continues to be a concern, as a field goal percentage of 42.3 on Thursday was lowered to 38.3 on Saturday afternoon.
“Youth is always synonymous with inconsistency and we have seen that throughout the course of a game, not necessarily the whole season yet,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scored on its first drive and then never again. The ball sailed through the uprights 7:37 into the first quarter. The 50-yard campaign into Yale territory represented the longest of the afternoon for the Crimson.
A facemask penalty tacked on to a sack, pushed the team to the Bulldog four-yard line before the drive sputtered to a halt. Yale’s defensive big-men forced the Crimson backward on the following three plays, forcing the three-point try. Harvard never again broke the Bulldog 20.
TRENCH WARFARE
The Crimson’s lackluster offense can be attributed to the Yale’s smothering defensive line.
“We knew going in that, wow, they were an incredibly seasoned, talented, big, strong, physical defensive front seven,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They had two 300-pounders in the middle that are great kids, great players, great athletes. Tremendous football team.”
On 31 attempts Harvard managed only 26 yards. At the half, freshman quarterback Jake Smith served as the squad’s leading rusher with seven. The team managed a net of six. Overall, the Crimson averaged .8 yards per attempt.
Running back Zane Dudek paced the Bulldogs with a team-leading 64 yards, more than doubling Harvard’s mark by himself. Melvin Rouse II forced another 42 on five attempts. The team racked up 118.
It wasn’t just the Crimson run game that suffered as a result of Yale’s defensive line performance but Smith, and then senior Joe Viviano. Both were rushed in the pocket consistently throughout the afternoon. The quarterbacks were pulled down six times for a total loss of 44 yards. Bulldog quarterback Kurt Rawlings only fell to the ground behind the line twice.
Overall, Yale offense combined for 295 yards while Harvard’s found only 164.
“This game today was won in the trenches,” Murphy said. “Nothing came easy today, to state the obvious. Nothing came easy for us today offensively.”
DROPPING THE BALL
The Crimson put the ball grass—more of mud by this point—twice during the game. The Bulldogs picked it up both times.
The two fumbles came as a result of pitches, which could have been foreshadowed earlier in the game. As Smith escaped left and the defenders pulled him down, he sent the ball flying in running back Aaron Shampklin’s direction. The clearly surprised freshman pulled down the projectile, but was immediately wrapped up.
Later, Smith went for the pitch again on much the same type of play. Still not expecting the ball, this time the tailback failed to pull it in. The pigskin hit the ground and was swooped up by Yale’s Malcolm Dixon. The sophomore defensive back carried the ball 19 yards to the end zone to extend the Bulldog’s lead to 11.
“I saw the quarterback pitch it,” Dixon said. “I saw him slip. I saw the end zone. I saw the ball. That was pretty much it.”
Exactly three plays later, Harvard went to the pitch option. Smith’s toss to Shampklin hit the running back in the hands and fell again to the ground. Yale recovered. The Bulldogs burned the remaining time in the second half and tacked on a field goal to head into the half up 14. The Crimson didn’t pitch the ball again.
JUSTICE’S LEAGUE
Nine quarters. That is how long it has been since the Harvard offense last converted a six point scoring play.
A two yard pass from Viviano to senior tight end Jake Barann in the third quarter of the team’s last victory against Columbia is the Crimson’s most recent touchdown. But junior receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley sure got the team close.
The first drive of The Game was Harvard’s most productive, and Shelton-Mosley led the campaign. The first play from scrimmage, Smith found the Shelton-Mosley who extended to catch for a 21 yard gain—his longest of the day.
The Crimson went to the ground and found Yale’s wall of a front seven waiting. Smith returned to Shelton-Mosley again, this time for nine. Three plays later, the junior wide out hauled down another for 18 to the Bulldog’s nine-yard line. After that, offensive production essentially halted.
“[Yale does] a great job of man coverage,” Murphy said. “They’ve sort of mimicked what Columbia has done, and they’ve got a big, strong front seven, and they’ve got big, strong secondary guys and they just play right in your grill, and they do a great job making it really challenging just to get off the ball, and in these conditions even more challenging.”
On the afternoon, Shelton-Mosley led Harvard with 77 yards and seven receptions. No other Crimson receiver managed to pull down more than one pass. The performance was Shelton-Mosley’s best of the season.
“I mean Justice is just one of those guys that he gets more than his share of double coverage every week,” Murphy said. “He’s our best athlete. He’s such a great kid, he’s such a champion that he … [made the most] against man coverage the whole day and also most of the time with man coverage the safety was over the top of him as well.”
Although, it’s not offensively where the wide out has dominated this season. Shelton-Mosley has been a reckoning force for the special teams. Prior to The Game, the junior was ranked number one in the FCS for both punt returns for touchdowns (two) and punt return average (18.8 yards).
The Bulldogs did everything in their power not to kick him the ball. In a game with 162 more punt yards than offensive production, Shelton-Mosley managed only one returnable kick, and pushed that for 18 yards. The rest of the time, Yale booted the ball out of bounds or high enough to force a fair catch.
Even on kickoffs, Yale frequently squibbed the ball up the biddle or chipped it to the bigger members of Harvard’s return team. Shelton-Mosley only clocked on kickoff return for three yards.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captains Harry Tafur and Colin Chiapello’s freshman season was disappointing, finishing seventh in the Northeast Water Polo Conference tournament in 2014.
The co-captains entered the program in the midst of coach Ted Minnis’s historic reformation, from only 12 wins in his first season to a program-best 27 wins last year.
From seventh to back to back champions, the two seniors are leaving conference play on top for the second straight year after toppling Princeton in sudden death overtime in front of a packed Blodgett Pool on Sunday afternoon. Now Harvard moves onto the NCAA tournament, where the team made the Final Four last year.
The golden goal came from standout freshman Dennis Blyashov, NEWPC rookie of the year, rookie of the tournament, tournament MVP, and first-team all conference.
“Blyashov is a great kid first and foremost. I love having him on this team and being part of our family,” Minnis said.
“He works so hard and is so passionate about everything he does in and out of the pool. He has a drive, a passion that you only see from special players. I’m just glad we have him for three more years.”
HARVARD 12, PRINCETON 11
The Tigers took command early, jumping to a 5-1 lead after just six minutes of play.
Blyashov scored the first two goals of the game for Harvard, but it wasn’t enough to dent Princeton’s early lead.
The Crimson played cool, and the team started to slowly chop away at Princeton’s lead. With only four minutes left in the fourth quarter, Harvard was down 10-8. It was a fight for every possession.
“This group is very calm and they always believed and they worked and they just keep working in every possession,” Minnis said. “If you worry about every possession and not the outcome then you’ll have some success and that’s what we do.”
A power play goal from sophomore Charlie Owens brought the Crimson within one, right before Harvard’s game-tying 10th goal with only 52 seconds left in regulation.
In overtime, Tafur struck first, but the Tigers answered with one of their own to force a sudden death overtime. Blyashov then delivered the game winner just inside the far post to win the title at home.
HARVARD 9, ST. FRANCIS 7
Facing its first real test of the weekend the team defeated No. 18 St. Francis, 9-7, to advance to the conference finals.
In the first quarter neither team was able to claim an advantage with each side scoring three goals each, setting up a tight match down the stretch.
The Terriers were able to pull ahead in the second with four goals to Harvard’s two.
The Crimson was able to change the tide in the second half thanks to an air tight defense and an impressive 11 saves by Ridgely to stymie to ds St. Francis.
“On our team, our defense feeds our offense, so we made sure we weren’t thinking too far ahead, taking everything one possession at a time,” Tafur said. In the third quarter, goals from Blyashov and Owens leveled the score at seven.
Harvard pulled ahead in the fourth with go-ahead goal from Enright and Blyashov got on the board one last time to secure the win.
HARVARD 16, IONA 7
In the first matchup of the weekend, Harvard squared off against six-seed Iona and handily defeated the Gaels 16-7.
“We talked all week about how this was going to be the tone setter and… if we wanted to win a championship we had to play 12 good quarters,” Minnis said. “We jumped out to an 8-1 lead on them and kind of just went from there.”
The Crimson dominated play from the get go, scoring four times in the first period while blanking Iona.
Blyashov netted the first goal of the game, and totalled 5 more across the four quarters.
Juniors Grayson Judge and Grant Harvey also scored once a piece in the first. Between the posts, junior Anthony Ridgley and sophomore Nikhil Suri split time and recorded 5 and 7 saves, respectively.
“It was awesome to win in the home pool,” Tafur said.

If you aren’t going home for Thanksgiving, never fear. You won’t be alone on campus for Turkey Day. In fact, plenty of students stay on campus for the weekend. If you’re feeling antisocial and don’t want to go to the HUDS Thanksgiving dinner, or just want a small celebration with your close friends, here’s how you can make your own Thanksgiving feast from your favorite Square retailers.
The Turkey
The bird is obviously the most important (and the hardest) part of any Thanksgiving meal. But lucky you—your dorm room doesn’t have a kitchen, so you’re not expected to make one! You can cop out on this one and pick up pre-cooked chicken breast from Broadway Market. If you’re seriously jonesing for the real thing, see if they have any in their hot food bar.
Potatoes
Every family has their own preferred potato style for this holiday: mashed, au gratin, lyonnaise… the list goes on. But you are a college student with a limited budget, so we will be sticking to the two purest forms of potato: fries and chips. Grab a bag of Lay’s (or Cape Cod, if you want to impress your guests) from the trusty 24-hour CVS. For fries you have a couple of options: Shake Shack for crinkle-cut, Charlie’s for waffle, or Clover for rosemary (fancy!).
Peas
These you can actually make in the comfort of your own home. Get a bag of frozen peas from CVS, Trader Joe’s, or pretty much anywhere with a frozen section. Toss those bad boys into a bowl with some water, place them in your HSA-issue microfridge, and nuke ‘em for 2 to 3 minutes. If you’re really feeling it, snag some new salt and pepper grinders from the d-hall and go wild.
Cranberry Sauce
We are honestly at a loss for how to improvise such a strange dish that people literally eat once per year. RIP Market’s holiday-themed hot food station. Tatte is selling “Cranberry Pear Compote” as part of their Thanksgiving menu…but for $12 a pound. No thanks. Maybe skip this one.
Dessert
While the turkey may be the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, dessert is obviously the crowd favorite. It’s also the easiest to do on this list. Petsi Pies is a whole institution devoted to pies. Buy a pie there. Eat with friends. End of story.
Drinks
For an occasion such as this, the month-old box of Franzia Sunset Blush in your room won’t do. Swing by C’est Bon for some celebratory Andre, a bottle of wine, or some rum to spike hot cider with. After all, what’s a good Friendsgiving if not an excuse to rage? Cheers to a five-day weekend!

There’s no denying it: Harvard students have a lot to be thankful for. But let’s focus on what we all agree really matters, and what we all know needs to change.
Blessed: Veritaffles
Whether you need sobering after a wild night or whether you want to fortify yourself for a lot of procrastinated work on the weekends, a sugary Veritaffle-induced coma will do the trick. It’s good to know that Harvard will always be there to enable our bad decision-making.
Cursed: Memorial Church Bells
If you want to wake up at any time that is a) not on the hour, b) completely arbitrary, and c) annoying because they never stop ringing, then these are a perfect bet! One of the many advantages to living in Canaday.
Blessed: Tatte
Study session? Brunch date? Craving for olfactory stimulation? Tatte is good for your happiness and bad for your wallet.
Cursed: Friday Night Deadlines
So it’s your fault that you ran into the Barker Center at 4:59 to turn in a paper due at 5:00, and all the doors were locked, so you set off all the alarms, which kept ringing until a security guard came to turn them off? What were you supposed to do, turn it in early?
Blessed: The Shuttle System
Harvard’s campus may be fairly small, enclosed, and accessible, but that isn’t going to stop us complaining about the arduous fifteen-minute odyssey from the Yard to the Quad, or the Yard to Mather. On weekdays, the shuttles have your back. (On weekends, though, all bets are off. And there’s just no winning if you live in River West.)
Cursed: Just Three Days of Thanksgiving Break
Enough said. Step it up.
