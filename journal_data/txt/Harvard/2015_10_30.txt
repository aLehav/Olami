After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Joyce Carol Oates is considered one of the finest contemporary American authors. A National Book Award winner and National Humanities Medal recipient, Oates is known for her prolific literary output—she has published more than 40 novels, along with many novellas, short stories, plays, poems, and essays. On Oct. 19, she read an excerpt from her recently published second memoir, “The Lost Landscape” at a Harvard Book Store-sponsored event at the First Church of Cambridge. The book recalls her early coming-of-age in upstate New York. On the Monday before her reading, The Harvard Crimson spoke to her about her inspirational sources and the background for the “Landscape.”
The Harvard Crimson: Did you feel that you had different responsibilities in writing a memoir than in writing fiction?
Joyce Carol Oates: Certainly, in writing a memoir you are trying to tell the truth, and that’s an definitely an enormous difference.… And then there are some things in it that I’ve had to imagine. If you remember part of a conversation with someone, you might remember the most important thing that’s said, but you don’t remember the words surrounding it. In writing a memoir you have to imagine what probably led up to this remark that you do remember. In that way it is a little like fiction, in the sense that you have to imagine a context. And when I write about my family farm I sort of shut my eyes and see this picture, and I’m basing it on a memory now that’s quite old, but our earliest memories are imprinted very deeply in our brain and may be the last memories that we have.… If you shut your eyes and really make an effort, you can be transported to your earliest surroundings, and you do sort of see them in a way, you know, not literally, but you can start to describe them.
THC: What did you enjoy about the memoir-writing?
JCO: My favorite part of the memoir is “Happy Chicken” and my childhood life. I prefer to read from the early sections rather than the later. The later sections become sad because my parents eventually die and everyone you know gets older and eventually they die, so a memoir usually has a sad ending. But it often has a really idyllic opening.
THC: What inspired you to write from the perspective of a hen you had growing up in the “Happy Chicken” section?
JCO: Well, I wanted to write about my experiences between the ages of two and six…but I couldn’t really have much perspective from the point of a view of a child so young. I don’t have any real intellectual memory of that child, so the only way that I could write about it was from a perspective that was outside the [childhood]. So Happy Chicken is able to talk about the father and the mother, and Happy Chicken can look ahead into the future. It’s sort of a literary device that allows the author to transcend the limits of a point of view.… I’m truly not sure what happened to Happy Chicken. I hope that my grandmother didn’t just slaughter him. That may have been just what happened, but I remember that Happy Chicken just sort of disappeared. So it’s like some of our childhood fantasies and things we love when we were children, and they were very much part of our childhood memories, but then we don’t really know what happen[s] to them, and we have to grow up.
THC: On that subject, I was wondering about the significance of the title and the idea of a lost landscape.
JCO: The landscape is actually lost because the farmhouse is gone. The farm was sold, other people live there, and they built a different house.… “The Lost Landscape” also refers to childhood itself and to our memories. We keep trying to come back but we can’t really get there because it is lost and gone.
THC: Did you feel that, in writing this memoir, you were able to sort of preserve or crystallize that landscape in some way?
JCO: Yeah, pretty much. I wrote a lot about some things, like the abandoned houses, in our part of Erie county. There seemed to be a lot of farms, abandoned houses, and we did a lot of exploring in those houses.… That really awakened my early interest in other people: Seeing these clues left behind, things on the floor or articles of clothing in the closet, just made me really wonder who the people had been. It was almost like the houses were haunted. So I found it really stimulating, and when I think about it even now, it makes me feel that I want to write something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, Oct. 25, “OTHER: A Multiracial Student Photo Gallery,” an exhibit by Amanda J.N. Mozea '17, opened at the Student Organization Center at Hilles. Meant to expose attitudes toward multiracial students at Harvard, the gallery consists of photographs of more than 50 biracial students and includes their answers to questions regarding their race. With this gallery, Mozea intends to create a space to help others better understand identity.
As a biracial student, Mozea, an inactive Crimson editor, claims that she herself experiences the ignorant behavior she hopes to lay bare with this exhibit. She says that her experience at a black association event, when a girl implied Mozea didn’t have enough phenotypically black features to justify her presence there, inspired her to create the project. “This project was started in a lot of ways out of my hurt...and my desire to show everyone how insensitive and wrong comments like that are,” she says. “But as I began this project…it became more of a cathartic experience.”
Other models express similar sentiments. “I’ve felt fetishized by people for being mixed. That’s an uncomfortable feeling,” Amanda L. Beattie ’17 says.
Mozea stripped the models of all ornament, leaving them bare-faced for the shoots. “There was kind of a methodology behind that,” she says. “And it was so that [for] every model you see, the only thing looking out of their picture is themselves. And the hope is that you will form a connection…. I want you to exchange glances with the people you see.”
Being so naked on camera was the hardest part for some models, like Javier Cuan-Martinez ’18. “[The photos] are very bare,” he says. “There’s no filter, no nothing. That’s who you are in your purest form. That to me was a little shocking.”
In an effort to engage with her audience, Mozea includes a pair of boxes beneath photographs of two ethnically ambiguous male models with the captions, “What is Alexander?” and “What is Jordan?” and a prompt for viewers to answer on a sheet of paper. “It’s very natural for us to label people subconsciously,” she says. “I wanted those boxes to make it overt...and have people acknowledge that when you look at Jordan [or] Alexander, you’re going to label them.”
With these boxes, Mozea intends to show the arbitrary nature of labels. “The exhibit highlights how we can’t be put in a box,” said Rakesh Khurana, dean of the College, at the opening. Drawing from his own experiences with his children, who are biracial, he explained what the exhibit means to him. “Our way to define ourselves is our own right,” he said. “It’s not something that someone can do for you. This exhibit begins to raise those questions in an important and fundamental way.”
In attempting to answer such questions, the exhibit works to establish a community for people to start conversations about race. For instance, reading the transcripts of interviews with other models about how they define themselves has provided Cuan-Martinez with new perspectives. “One of the girls said that she defined herself as a lesbian,” he says. “I never attributed my sexuality to who I am because it’s been so natural to me to be heterosexual…. To see someone else define themselves with something that’s not visible…is really what hit me hard.”
Beattie agrees. “It’s helpful to help people realize the complications of racial identity,” she says. She better appreciates the community she is a part of after meeting and hearing what others had to say. “I got to feel like [I was] part of a community [coming from] a biracial culture,” she says. “It’s kind of a powerful place to be, to be able to dismantle ideas about race just by being myself.”
By initiating this discussion about race, the gallery seeks to enlighten not only visitors but also participants about the multiple layers that constitute multiraciality. According to Mozea, working on the project has also had profound effects on her. “It showed me the shortcomings that I had in my approach to this project,” she says. “I [now] have a much more full and much more human picture of what it means to be confused about race because there were so many approaches that I wasn’t able to consider before.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am studying abroad in London this semester, and in so many ways, my life here is similar to my life at Harvard.
I am in a city with great restaurants, a storied past, and a fascinating culture.
I have class with bright, opinionated students from all over the world who teach me new facts and introduce me to novel perspectives almost every time they speak.
I take courses that inspire me to think harder and to question everything.
To be honest, there are many parts of Harvard I don’t miss.
I don’t miss the stress that I constantly feel and that constantly surrounds me at Harvard. I don’t miss the consistent battles with the administration. I don’t miss the social and extracurricular exclusion.
But there is something I miss, and I miss it a lot.
I miss my friends.
Unfortunately, though, when I reflect on my two years at Harvard to date, I realize that I have not spent enough time with my friends.
Too often, I fit them into a 30-minute meal during which I was distracted by whatever it was that I had before and after the meal. Too frequently, I spent time with my friends, only to be on my phone the entire time checking emails that just had to be answered. Too consistently, I didn’t spend time with them on a Friday or Saturday night because there was a party I wanted to attend. Too regularly, I buried myself in my work or my meetings, unable to see my friends between Monday and Friday.
What scares me most on a personal level is that I would not have realized my inability to prioritize the part of Harvard I care about most had I not studied abroad. I likely would not have recognized this failure until I was in a big city by myself after college, without my friends nearby and with few possibilities to see them.
What scares me most for our community is that when I listen to peers and watch people’s experiences, I see too many Harvard students who make the same mistakes I have made.
Harvard encourages us to commit fully to our work, to our activities, and to our future careers. And so, we treat friends as a second priority—as something that can be fit in around everything else we do. I hear many people say they’d love to make time for someone, but they just can’t because of work and other social commitments. Or that the person lives in the Quad, and the extra 25 minutes the commute entails needs to be committed to reading.
We have our entire lives to succeed, and we have our entire lives to work towards our careers.
The beauty of college, on the other hand, is that it’s the only four years of our lives in which we live within 15 minutes of all of our best friends. We also have no nine-to-five job to preoccupy our days. We can therefore decide how we spend our time, where we spend it, and with whom we spend it. This freedom means we can see our friends when we want to do so.
Maybe the things we learn in our time with friends cannot be assessed with a grade or placed on a resume, but they are important to our development as people. And as I’ve learned this semester, spending time with our friends is vital to our happiness.
When I spoke with another Harvard student who is studying abroad this semester, I asked her what she missed most about Harvard.
She said, “Maybe it’s just because yesterday was Sunday, but what I’ve missed most is Sunday brunch with my blockmates.”
Her answer resonated with me, and it made consider the moments I miss most from life at Harvard.
I miss J.P. Licks at 10 p.m. with my best friends more than anything else.
So, I am extending a challenge to the Harvard community. Let’s not wait until we’ve moved on from this place to realize how incredible Sunday brunch and J.P. Licks hangouts are.
Whatever your tradition is with your friends, whatever the moments you love most are, build your schedule around them for a change, instead of fitting those memories into the smallest time slots of your crazy weeks.
I know we will never regret having spent a couple fewer hours per week on our work and activities.
I do think we will regret not having spent more time with our friends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On October 22, Master Sergeant Joshua L. Wheeler became the first American solider to die in Iraq since 2011. He was killed in a raid by Delta Force personnel and Kurdish Special Forces to free Kurdish hostages of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The raid, requested by the Kurdish regional government, actually freed about 70 different prisoners, all of whom appear to have also been close to execution and 69 of whom were Sunni Arabs. Master Sergeant Wheeler of Oklahoma is survived by his wife and four sons, including an infant.
His death represents a sad reminder of the state of the war against ISIS, and of the situation in Iraq and Syria more broadly. After eight years of American occupation, only three years of disintegration have brought Delta Force operatives back to the country where they first became masters of the night raid. The Pentagon press secretary has suggested that raids like last Thursday’s are not “something that’s going…to happen on a regular basis,” but similar operations have occurred before, most notably in May when a mission in Syria killed ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf. Just Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told Congress that raids would become a centerpiece of American strategy in the region.
Of course, Master Sergeant Wheeler’s sacrifice is of incalculable value to the men he and his comrades rescued. One, Muhammad Hassan Abdullah al-Jibouri, made a special point of thanking the United States and Wheeler during a press conference in which Mr. Jibouri and other prisoners described how the actions and ethnicities of their relatives made them targets of ISIS’s ire. Unfortunately, Mr. Jibouri’s wife and son remain in ISIS territory. One can only hope that Mr. Jibouri’s family will have the opportunity to see him again, unlike Master Sergeant Wheeler’s.
As Secretary Carter’s comments make clear, the United States is still defining its strategy for dealing with ISIS, but the President seems ready to increase direct military involvement. That approach raises serious constitutional issues, chief among which are how Congress has still not managed to authorize these operations and why the Obama administration believes that it does not have to ask Congress for permission. But even more pressing is a practical question: How is it that the U.S. is still tinkering with its policy to such an extent?
Only time will deliver the full answer, but one very clear problem is the wishful thinking that went into a key part of the administration’s initial policy. That crucial component was the $500 million Pentagon program to train a new group of Syrian rebels who would be moderate, pro-Western, and focused primarily on destroying ISIS. Someone creatively dubbed this proposed new Syrian force the “New Syrian Forces.” The goal was to have 5,400 rebels trained in Turkey and back in Syria by the end of the year.
When the first, very small group of 54 of these fighters entered Syria in July, however, the Al-Qaeda affiliated al-Nusra Front destroyed them as a fighting force. The video of General Lloyd Austin, in charge of U.S. Central Command, telling Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska that only “four or five” members of the “New Syrian Forces” remained in fighting shape is fairly excruciating to watch, and provided fodder for comedian John Oliver of Last Week Tonight.
After another group of 75 rebels did their erstwhile compatriots one better by offering American arms to the Nusra Front last month, the Pentagon suspended the training program.
The failure of the “New Syrian Forces” should not have been a surprise. Unfortunately, U.S. history offers numerous versions of a pretty simple lesson: If rebel groups depend upon you entirely for support, they are probably not worth it. President Kennedy learned this lesson with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. As in Syria, the U.S. relied on training a group of rebels in a third country, in the Cuban case, Guatemala. As in Syria, air support was key; the idea in both situations was that American warplanes would provide enough cover to ensure the rebels’ success.
One difference in Kennedy’s approach was his insistence on secrecy. But that policy bears a similarity to Obama’s emphasis on keeping the U.S.’s footprint as light as possible. In both cases, the desire not to get too heavily involved led both administrations to lend their proxies inadequate support. Of course, the light footprint approach is appropriate in a post-Bush administration, post-Iraq debacle Middle East, but it must rely on allies with proven ability. Effective and motivated fighters do not emerge out of crash courses.
Indeed, even former enemies can be better friends. This lesson is a central one from the surge in Iraq. There, a key part of General Petraeus’s approach was paying about 103,000 Sunnis to cease fighting Americans, and to start pushing out extremist groups. Encouraging former enemies to switch sides requires a specific confluence of circumstances, to say nothing of political will. Petraeus did not get prior approval for his plan. But engineering such a policy will likely be part of the price of peace in Syria.
A better sense of history might have saved the Obama administration from the ignominious failure of the New Syrian Forces. Now that another American has given his life in Iraq, the least we owe him is a less rose-tinted approach to the conflict. Mr. Jibouri’s child will still likely be grappling with the sectarian scars of the region, but better decision-making might be able to ensure that he does that grappling with words instead of arms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My ideas bank seems to go bankrupt every time I sit down to write a column on a Wednesday night. But a quick walk usually fixes the problem—whether that is walking to class at a slightly more leisurely pace than my signature half-jog or taking 10 minutes to circle a Winthrop courtyard.
This week, however, nothing could bail out my bankruptcy. I took a walk (it was nasty outside), bought time by giving my room its monthly clean (tomorrow it’ll swing back to equilibrium), and grabbed friends to ask for ideas (didn’t work, thanks for nothing). My semesterly brain clog has finally arrived and it is time to go back to the woods. And while the woods are on my mind, why not kill two birds with one stone by pulling an inevitable Nicholas Kristof and preach the outdoors gospel?
It’s not an exaggeration to say that “the outdoors” has become quite a fad lately. If you’ve climbed a mountain in the past few months, chances are pretty decent that your current profile picture is you-plus-water-bottle-plus-backpack, your windblown hair hinting that you’re somewhere high up. In a world of insanity where connection is taken for granted, disconnection has become cool. On a campus saturated by people sporting Patagonia and flannel shirts, looking and becoming “outdoorsy” has become something all by itself, perhaps even a bit disconnected from why people go to the woods in the first place. Indeed, it’s an activity that is inextricably linked with socioeconomic and racial complications of accessibility and image, on our campus and beyond.
If the word “outdoorsy” strikes up an image, so too does “being outdoors.” When the Great Outdoors are preached, likely there are other virtues being preached with it. Going to the woods buys you remoteness for profound reflection. It’ll give you a solitude that is both beautiful and lonely; it’ll make you more appreciative of both yourself and the people that surround you. If you are in company, it’ll open up space for deep conversations and genuine connection. It’ll make you more appreciative of Earth. It’ll test you both physically and emotionally. It’ll even out all that you carry inside, as you balance on shaky rocks and unexpected roots.
This is one outdoors gospel—albeit an overly exposed one (I am complicit)—but it doesn’t have to be yours. Although many around me are fellow preachers, I am aware that many of the buzzwords that surround outdoor activity are subject to eye rolls and half-hearted nods. In a similar way, the popular image of “outdoorsy” often turns away people who feel the pressure of decking out in hiking gear to hit a trailhead.
The woods are beautiful because no matter how many people share them, they are infinitely yours. The Appalachian Trail is famous for looking pretty much the same all along its 2000-plus miles, but every step and every experience at a summit is different and contextualized in the unique complexities of your life and your situation. The woods are full of these disconnected stories but wonderfully united in their emptiness for each individual person; you go for your own reasons, and it is your experience to sketch. Once you’re in the sameness of the trees, it is your choice how much you want the crude realities of our external differences to play into your experience.

On October 16, students from the Harvard Undergraduate Organization for Prison Education and Reform held a vigil in the Science Center Plaza to protest juvenile solitary confinement in the United States. In one-hour shifts, 23 students stood for one hour each in a seven foot by nine-foot rectangle marked on the pavement with blue tape, holding a sign that read “How should we change the prison system?”
According to HOPE’s website, the tape was placed so to that the space “inside” and “outside” the box is continuous, in order to prod passersby to “consider the space in relation to their own lives.” The protest’s goal was to call attention to the approximately 2.3 million people incarcerated in the United States. According to the advocacy group Solitary Watch, at least 80,000 of these people are held in solitary confinement, many of under the age of 18.
Solitary confinement is a barbaric practice, unacceptable as a routine punishment. Medical experts like Harvard Medical School professor Atul Gawande have labeled solitary confinement psychological torture, and studies have only begun to document that dramatic and heartbreaking damage that it does. Suicidal thoughts and self-harm are commonplace. After living through extended periods of solitary confinement, reintegration to the outside world can become an emotional impossibility.
Due to the devastating psychological and health effects brought about by even short periods “in the hole,” juvenile solitary confinement is especially barbaric. The ACLU and Human Rights Watch estimate that adult prisons and jails hold around 95,000 additional juveniles, who face the same threat of solitary as older inmates. Many who are sent to solitary have not even violated any rules; they are there “for their own protection,” often because they are homosexual or transgender, or have been raped.
In addition to human costs, solitary confinement carries huge economic costs. Each prisoner in solitary confinement costs the state approximately $75,000 per year, in contrast to $25,000 for other prisoners.
Solitary confinement also raises constitutional issues. We agree with the New York Times that solitary confinement is a violation of the eighth Amendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishments, and we would welcome a Supreme Court challenge. Justice Anthony Kennedy agrees. “The process,” he has said, “literally drives men mad.”
Aside from being unconstitutional and inhumane, solitary confinement is unnecessary. While prisons must make special accommodations for prisoners who pose extreme danger to their fellow inmates, long-term sensory deprivation and psychological punishment is not the only alternative.
What can America do? Summarily ending solitary confinement for juveniles would be a good first step. In the longer term, policymakers must take action to ensure that corrections officers employ this grave punishment as a last resort, not as an everyday practice or a constant threat. A corrections system based on rehabilitation rather than retribution will be cheaper and more humane for all concerned.
Of course, the failures of the criminal justice system begin long before anyone enters prison. From arrest to trial to sentencing and beyond, citizens must receive due process and equal protection under the law, regardless of their race and origin. Mandatory minimum sentencing, private prisons, and unaccountable corrections officers’ unions have brought an environment where prisons are dangerous and overcrowded, a situation which requires deep systemic reforms to ameliorate. And America as a society must work towards developing alternatives to prison—policies that keep our fellow citizens free to live their lives as long as they pose no danger to others. How should we change the prison system? Our answer is: dramatically, and soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian entrepreneur named the wealthiest man in Africa by Forbes, discussed the process of growing his business and the industrialization of Africa Thursday night at the Charles Hotel.
His talk marked the first in the Hakeem and Myma Belo-Osagie Distinguished African Business and Entrepreneurship Lecture series, which is co-hosted by the Harvard Business School’s Africa Business Club and the Center for African Studies. 
Caroline Elkins, the faculty director of the Center for African Studies who opened the event, highlighted Dangote’s impact on growing and opening up Nigeria’s economy. She likened Dangote to names like Rockefeller and Jobs for his “impact as a business leader and the ways in which he has been a change engine for not only his country, but his continent.”
The Dangote Group is a business conglomerate in Africa that specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of products that include cement, sugar, and flour.
Dangote discussed his start in business. He first began making money by taking a loan from his wealthy uncle in order to start trading commodities. Afterwards, he said, the first big investment he made was in cement, and then sugar. Dangote also mentioned failed business attempts such as in textiles.
Speaking to a room full of Business School students, Dangote mentioned lessons he has learned as a business leader. He advised staying aggressive and remaining in the market during tough economic times, and described an instance when his company faced 42 percent interest rates.
In response to a question about how to deal with issues that were not addressed in business school, Dangote said that unexpected problems are inevitable. He expects at least one problem a day, he said, but he just handles one at a time and remains focused.
To better handle problems that arise, he said the Dangote Group operates on a principle that “four to five people must understand the business inside and out” in each sector.

UPDATED: October 29, 2015, at 10:40 p.m.
Following recent discussions on social inclusivity and open social spaces, the College Events Board alongside other student groups will host a College-wide Halloween Party in Annenberg Hall on Saturday night.
Open to all undergraduates, the party will serve to carry out the mission of the CEB, namely to “execute free, inclusive, and fun college-wide programming,” said Pilar I. Fitzgerald ’15, an adviser to the College Events Board and a fellow at the Office of Student Life. 
The party comes amidst discussions about Harvard’s social scene, and its perceived exclusivity. An event dubbed the ‘Blank’ Party, held earlier this month, was another school-wide event aimed at providing party space for the entire student body.
In addition, several upperclassman Houses have been renovating prospective social spaces, in the hope that parties and other social events will be held on campus, as opposed to in off-campus spaces occupied by unrecognized social groups.
According to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, the event is funded in part by the University President’s Office, which also helped to fund the ‘Blank’ Party. In addition to the College Events Board, the Undergraduate Council, First-Year Social Committee, Freshman Dean’s Office, and staff at the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub all collaborated to organize the event.
“The FDO is very supportive of the mission of the College and looks forward to collaborating with the Office of Student Life on future events that provide all students the opportunity to come together in a safe space on-campus,” Torey E. Martin, a fellow at the Freshman Dean’s Office, wrote in an email.
Previously, Halloween parties in Annenberg have been open only to freshmen, but this year, Friedrich said, the event will be open to the student body at large.
“The FYSC was excited by the idea of opening up what had been an event for first year students to be something that was really for the whole campus,” Friedrich said.
The party will include both a ‘Haunted Hall,’ with a dance floor and live DJ in Annenberg, as well as free food and mocktails in the Queen’s Head Pub.

Whether sifting through piles of fluffy tutus at neighborhood clothing stores or scavenging in the most neglected and unexpected corners of dorm rooms, Harvard students are busy finding costumes for this weekend's Halloween festivities.
The Garment District is a popular stop for students looking for any type of costume—from Roaring Twenties flapper girl dresses to modern comic book superheroes. Across the noisy, chaotic space, employees ram around helping customers find fitting rooms and various costume accessories. The few days before Halloween are especially busy as students scramble to put last minute costumes together.
“Normally, my friends and I go down to Garment District the day of [Halloween],” said Thomas Ferland ’18. “The first time we did it…we went through older sections and picked out random stuff.”
Other students, similarly caught off guard by the imminent holiday, are relying on more economic means, searching around their dorm room for inspiration and potentially flamboyant clothing.
“I am not prepared for Halloween” Jorrion D. Wilson ’17 said, adding that he plans to dress up as “either nothing or a superhero...with some tights and things around the dorm.”
Some students are more prepared, harnessing their imagination to create quirky do-it-yourself costumes.
“I’m going to be Man Ray from Spongebob, and I’m making it,” Rachel L. Lobato ’16 said. “It’s been very well planned out… There are two other girls doing it with me”.
Others find a happy medium, making parts of their costumes and scavenging in store for smaller accessories.
Alina G. Munoz ’18 said she was dressing as an army ranger for Halloween, pulling together memorabilia from her family, old t-shirts, and war paint. She said she has also purchased some costume gear from Cambridgeside Galleria—namely, a camouflage-print hat and a belt of bullets.
Looking forward to the weekend festivities, Munoz said, “Follow the music, and you’ll find a party.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Halloween weekend approaches and students finalize their plans, Harvard proctors and tutors with children are also considering their options for the weekend celebrations.
Many proctors and tutors plan on taking their children to community organized events, such as those in Inman Square and at the Cambridge YMCA, according to a senior resident tutor in Adams House Maleka Donaldson Gramling.
Donaldson Gramling also mentioned some of the difficulties associated with living in an area so dominated by a university campus.
“In past years we’ve gone trick or treating in and around the area, though it’s actually quite hard to trick-or-treat,” she said. “We don’t go to the dorms though we’ve tried in the neighborhood. Half of the buildings around here are Harvard offices so it’s difficult."
Harvard proctor families often find events in the neighborhood to attend together.
“The proctors who have families will often go together to various things,” said Alex P. Douglas, proctor of Lionel A entryway. “For example, the [Harvard] Coop, during the afternoon has ... something like a Halloween fair on Saturday. So there are various events around."
When asked about whether Cambridge as a city caters to residents with children eager to trick-or-treat, Donaldson Gramling responded positively.
“There’s plenty of access to candy: my daughter’s school is having a Halloween dress-up after school event, the ‘Inmanween’ and Cambridge YMCA are community held events, and there are certain blocks down Oxford Street that decorate the buildings, which people drive over to for trick-or-treating,” she said.
Children also participate in events organized by their school or daycare establishments and go trick-or-treating in cordoned-off surrounding areas like Beacon Hill and Oxford Street.
“I think [Boston] is one of the best places to live during Halloween,” said Tim Ahfeldt, a proctor in Canaday.
Despite a lack of Harvard-organized activities for proctor families, some proctors still find ways to interact with college students. Ahfeldt and his wife, April Cook, plan on “reverse trick-or-treating” with their son in freshman entryways.

UPDATED: November 2, 2015, at 3:20 a.m.
Harvard Divinity School eked past the halfway point of its portion of the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign by June 30, raising just more than $25 million toward its $50 million goal, according to Lauren E. Wilson, the Divinity School’s associate director for campaign and donor relations.
University President Drew G. Faust said last month that the school’s campaign, which launched publicly in April 2014, has increasingly become a focus of the central administration’s fundraising efforts. 
“We’re going to refocus our energies on the aspects of the campaign that haven’t entirely met the aspirations that we had for them,” she said, specifically mentioning fundraising efforts at the the Divinity School, the Graduate School of Education, and Harvard Medical School.
For her part, Wilson said she feels that Harvard as a whole has supported the Divinity School in its fundraising efforts.
“I think that given the president’s commitment to and interest in the humanities, she’s been very helpful in the campaign,” said Hannah Peters, the Divinity School’sassociate dean of development and external relations.
Despite its progress, the Divinity School still lags behind other schools at the University in fundraising for the campaign. Harvard Medical School reached more than 60 percent of its goal, and the Graduate School of Education had its most successful fundraising year ever, raising $177 million, nearly 71 percent of its $250 million campaign, as of Sept. 30.
Harvard Law School had already raised almost 80 percent of its goal when it publicly launched its part of the drive last week. Overall, Harvard has raised $6.1 billion, moving even closer to its public target of $6.5 billion.
The Divinity School’s relatively slower progress could stem from its smaller alumni base and the number of graduates in financially lucrative positions compared to those from other schools like the Law School or Business School.
Wilson said the Divinity School’s campaign has received donations from its own alumni, alumni of other Harvard schools, and non-Harvard graduates.
“We’re very pleased with the progress so far. The money is really going where it’s needed most,” she said.
The campaign will support a number of goals, including financial aid, which 90 percent of Divinity School students receive, Wilson said. She added that 18 percent of campaign contributions have supported financial aid, and about another 50 percent have gone toward faculty development, including funding research and establishing professorships in fields such as contemporary Jewish studies and African-American religious studies.
Academic programs have received 13 percent of contributions, bolstering and spurring the inception of several endeavors like the the Buddhist Ministry Initiative, a program that trains Buddhist ministers, funded by a $2.7 million donation from the Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation.
As it moves forward, the school aims to focus on upgrading its 100-year-old facilities in Andover Hall, a priority since the campaign’s launch, Peters said.
“Like the University, the school has an aging infrastructure. The building was designed 100 years ago when teaching and learning were done in very different ways,” Peters said. “Part of it is just basic and significant infrastructure updating, and part of it is changing the building so it can reflect the way people teach and learn in the 21st century.”
Harvard’s capital campaign is scheduled to conclude in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four students have jumped in the race to lead Harvard’s Undergraduate Council next year ahead of a campaign season that has historically been a College-wide spectacle.
As of Thursday, two tickets of juniors have declared their intentions to run for UC president and vice president: Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17, who live in Cabot and Dunster Houses, respectively, as well as William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17, who both live in Pforzheimer House.
Rather and Banks, who are running for president and vice president, respectively, have both served on the UC since last school year. They are co-chairs of the Council’s Student Initiatives Committee. 
Greenlaw, also a member of the Council since last school year, is running for president alongside vice presidential candidate Morris, a UC outsider who has never served on the student government.
According to Elections Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18, there are no other contenders at this point. After opening this past Sunday, the official candidate declaration period will close Nov. 1.
Both tickets are now collecting student signatures, a requirement to run that they must complete by Nov. 2 in order to campaign. Banks and Rather said they had already surpassed the 150 signatures needed on Thursday evening.
The Council’s presidential elections regularly inspire multiple tickets and creative tactics from hopefuls looking to appeal to prospective voters. Candidates and their supporters, in search of attention from their peers, court student groups for endorsements, advertise through matching Facebook profile pictures, and populate the Yard with posters emblazoned with sometimes-ambitious campaign promises. The campaign also features a debate, “Crimson Crossfire,” that is co-hosted by The Crimson and the council and is scheduled this year for Nov. 14.
In recent years, satire and other revelry have also characterized the race. Two years ago, a pair of blockmates and campus comedians—Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15—won the election on a platform of bringing a certain kind of soup more regularly to campus dining halls and increasing the thickness of dorm room toilet paper. Last year two UC representatives—Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17—knowingly violated campaign rules and laughed about it. “Slap us in the cuffs. I’ll serve my time,” Heine said at the time.
Rather said she and Banks hope to “steer the momentum” of the student body on campus if they are elected, referencing recent campus discourse about issues such as sexual assault and student mental health.
“While we both are on the UC, we’ve come from outside of the UC,” Rather added.
Although Greenlaw could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening, Morris wrote on his Facebook page that their platform is to “combat the stigma surrounding mental health on campus, work with administrators to provide more student spaces, and coordinate with student groups to help the fight against sexual assault.”

Despite taking in a record $400 million pledge from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson this June, a budget deficit persists at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, requiring further fundraising and perhaps alternative sources of revenue to recover from the 2008 financial crisis and successfully expand its campus.
SEAS’s endowment saw a precipitous decline when the economic shock hit seven years ago, and the school has been in the red ever since, according to  Timothy Bowman, SEAS’s executive dean. The downturn coincided with an increased interest in science and engineering from the student body: Enrollment in SEAS courses grew by 149 percent over the past seven years, while the number of concentrators grew by 186 percent, according to SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff. 
This rapid growth has generated demand for new faculty members and teaching facilities, creating spending needs. Because SEAS is composed of research-heavy disciplines, the school needs to provide startup research funding and laboratories to attract new faculty, Karoff said.
Although Bowman declined to disclose the exact size of the school’s current deficit, he described it as “not insignificant” and said it has been consistent over the past several years, relative to the school’s overall budget.
The massive Paulson gift, meanwhile, will come to SEAS in the form of an endowment, meaning the school may only spend income from the principal. Paulson will pay the gift in installments over eight years, with the first coming in this December. Once the pledge is paid in full, it will make a significant impact on SEAS finances, generating $21 million to $25 million per year, depending on endowment returns, Karoff said.
Although the gift will go a long way toward alleviating the school’s current deficit, Bowman said, SEAS expenses are expected to go up in the next few years as the school prepares to transition to a new campus across the Charles River in Allston. The school will need to pay for the operation of the new facilities, plus contribute to construction costs.
Administrators are exploring alternative funding sources to address the deficit, including further donations, research grants from non-federal sources such as foundations and corporations, and new programs such as master’s degrees and continuing or executive education, according to Bowman.
Currently, SEAS predominantly confers Ph.D.s to its graduate students. This September, however, the school launched a new collaborative program, a Master’s of Design Engineering, with the Graduate School of Design. In the short term, Bowman said, the new program will not have a positive impact on the school’s finances, due to the startup cost required for its launch. But if the program grows in popularity, he added, it may help to generate revenues in the long term.
The new degree joined only two other existing terminal master’s programs at SEAS, one in Computational Science and Engineering, which focuses on data science and was introduced in 2013, and one in Electrical Engineering, which according to the school’s website offers admission only in “exceptional circumstances.”
Bowman said master’s degree and continuing education programs are common among other engineering schools—the Stanford School of Engineering and the Georgia Institute of Technology both offer education programs that target professionals. The University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences offers a wide range of master’s degree programs.
Although there is currently “no active conversation” on whether Harvard will start offering similar programs, Bowman said, administrators are exploring the possibilities. The Paulson gift, while giving SEAS the “luxury of time” to search for alternative financial resources, will not eliminate the need for further fundraising, he said.
“We continue to need to look for other financial resources,” he said. “We have to be prudent.”
Sean R. Eddy, a professor of Applied Mathematics, said the school’s new dean, Francis J. Doyle III, has “done a good job” at explaining the actual impact of the Paulson gift to the SEAS faculty.
“Everyone has the impression that Frank has a $400 million check in his pocket,” he said. “And of course it doesn’t work that way.”

Speaking at the Kennedy School of Government on Thursday night, Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen lauded the Nordic welfare state but acknowledged the perverse labor incentives that its social programs can engender.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Kennedy School acting Dean Archon Fung, came just hours after Rasmussen attended the annual Northern Future Forum hosted in Reykjavik, a summit between the Nordic-Baltic Eight and the United Kingdom. Rasmussen, the leader of Denmark’s centre-right Liberal Party, assumed office in June 2015, having also previously served as Prime Minister from 2009 to 2011.
Rasmussen began his remarks by introducing the achievements of the Danish welfare state, noting the tradeoff Danes make by accepting a high level of taxation—up to more than 50 percent of their income—for a high level of security. Among its social programs, Denmark guarantees one year of paid maternity leave, subsidized early childhood development and care, and free higher education.
“Denmark is sometimes compared to a bumblebee—at first sight it seems almost impossible that a bumblebee would be able to fly, but it does,” Rasmussen said. “And as I understand, the main reason is that a bumblebee flaps harder with its wings than other wings, and perhaps that explains why we are flying as well.”
Rasmussen highlighted four reasons why the Danish social welfare state was successful: first, the creation of a strong social contract between the citizens and the government, in which high tax payments return in the form safety and comprehensive services; second, a broad economic consensus across political parties; third, a flexible labor market that makes it easy to hire or fire employees; and fourth, the access to the European single market.
But Rasmussen also noted that Denmark was not without its own challenges. With significant Asian economic growth, for instance, Rasmussen said Denmark needs to confront the outsourcing of jobs to low-salary countries like China and India.
“In a society with high taxes, we have to be very conscious about the incentives to work—in a society with a high level of social security, we have to pay special attention to the incentives among lower-income groups,” he added. “We continuously have to make sure that we do not undermine the sense of personal responsibility and citizenship.”
Rasmussen proposed capping the amount that individuals can receive from the state while cutting taxes on low-income individuals. These two policy changes, he suggested, would work in tandem to increase the income gap between those that live solely on social benefits and those who work at a low-income level.
When asked about Denmark’s tough response to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis—the Danish government recently placed ads in Lebanese newspapers warning refugees not to come to the country—Rasmussen said that, while he was sympathetic to those seeking a better life, Denmark—and Europe—could not accept millions of refugees.
“We need to make this distinction between refugees from the war, who we are going to protect, and people who are migrants, who want a better life,” Rasmussen said, noting that trying to integrate waves of migrants would be too burdensome for his country. Rasmussen added that he wanted to strengthen incentives for those that do come to the country to integrate themselves in Danish society, learning the language and joining its workforce.
“Europe realizes that of course we need to stand up for our values and we need to welcome refugees, but we also must understand that we can’t absorb potentially ten million,” Rasmussen said. “Therefore we have to do a lot at the same time—invest more in the neighboring countries, invest more in a political solution.”

The Carpenter Center for Visual Arts opened two new exhibitions, “Where Margins Become Centers” by Lorraine O’Grady and “Skins and Stand-ins” by Shahryar Nashat on Thursday evening.
O’Grady, a New York based conceptual artist, and Nashat, a Swiss visual artist and sculptor were both present at the opening and greeted attendees. 
O’Grady’s exhibit included a variety of media such as photo-montages, photographic diptychs, film, and writing. It featured a photographic diptych of the 19th century poet Charles Baudelaire and American pop star Michael Jackson. The piece was titled “The First and the Last Modernists.”
The exhibit also provided a history of the O’Grady’s life as an artist by displaying archival documents about her entrance into the art world as Mlle Bourgeoise Noire (Miss Black Middle-Class).
O’Grady said that her work uses juxtapositions of cultural elements and dichotomies to challenge preconceived social constructs and power dynamics.
“I used the diptychs to establish equality between things that are totally disparate,” she said.
O’Grady added that she did not have a set process of making art.
“Whatever the medium is, I learn enough about it to make a piece,” she said.
Nashat’s “Skins and Stand-ins” drew attention to the human body. His film Hustle in Hand featured short clips of ordinary human activity, such as eating and exchanging money, that varied slightly with each repetition. The film was projected onto a wall assembled specifically for the video.
The exhibit also included Two Thighs Rooted in Marble. The sculpture, which was composed of two brass rods fixed in a block of marble, presented an abstract view of the body.
James Voorhies, the director of the Carpenter Center, highlighted the fact that both exhibits explore a variety of mediums.

Members of on-campus activist organization Student Labor Action Movement joined UNITE HERE Local 26 members to rally outside the Harvard Club of Boston on Thursday evening in protest of proposed changes to employee health care plans, which they say would raise out-of-pocket costs for employees. Local 26 serves Boston’s hotel and food service workers and represents Harvard Club staff.
The Harvard Club of Boston, a private business not affiliated with the University but serving Harvard alumni and graduates of selected affiliated universities, has been engaged with contract renegotiations since last spring, Local 26 organizer Tiffany Ten Eyck said. According to Ten Eyck, the proposed plan would include higher deductibles and copays.
“[It] doesn’t represent what the club is about, it doesn’t represent what the Harvard community is to [the workers,]” Ten-Eyck said.
For her part, Harvard Club of Boston spokesperson Diana C. Pisciotta wrote in an emailed statement that the proposed health care plan will not reduce benefits, and emphasized that the hotel’s vacation time allotments and scheduling as well as its $17-22 per hour wages are competitive.
“We are fully committed to strong health insurance benefits and have recommended a health plan that both maintains the current level of benefits and is more cost-effective than the current UNITE plan,” Pisciotta said in the statement.
Protesters carried signs and chanted outside the front entrance of the Harvard Club, which is located in downtown Boston. Rally organizers scheduled the protest for Thursday to coincide with the club’s annual live boxing match and dinner event in order to “try to exert some pressure” on members of the club, SLAM member Henry M. Gomory ’17 said.
“[Harvard Club workers] feel certain that club members will be sympathetic, that they don’t want to see picket lines in front of their club,” Ten Eyck said. “They’re going to whatever it takes to get club members to talk to them.”
For some members of SLAM, Timothy H. Shea ’18 said, the rally is significant in the larger context of healthcare debates at Harvard, which have abounded since fall 2014 when the University restructured and then modified changes to health care benefits for non-union employees amidst backlash. Health care is also a point of contention in the ongoing contract renegotiation between the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
“As future alumni, we have a responsibility to make sure our voices are heard about this, and [Harvard Club workers’] voices are heard about this,” Shea said.
Yosy M. Villatoro, a housekeeper at the Harvard Club, said the protests aim to keep health care and benefits at their current levels. “We want health insurance that’s fair, that we can actually afford,” Villatoro said via a translator. “If we get a good agreement our families are the direct beneficiaries of it.”
The rally, the workers’ second this month, comes two years after the club met a class action lawsuit from employees with a $4 million settlement. In that lawsuit, wait staff employees argued that the Club’s practice of including a 17 percent “Club Charge” on meal and beverage bills, which was not issued to workers as gratuity, was misleading and had violated Massachusetts tip laws. Local 26 president Brian Lang, who helped organize the rally, said the current debates about healthcare and benefits are charged by the previous settlement.
Lang said future rallies remain a possibility.
“We’re planning on doing whatever it takes to stand behind these workers and make sure they get a fair and just contract,” he said.
University spokespeople declined to comment on the rally.

Launching its portion of the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign last among Harvard’s schools last week, Harvard Law School started with unusual, if encouraging, information: After just its quiet phase, the school has raised $241 million, nearly 80 percent of its public goal of $305 million.
This early success, donors and fundraising officials predict, will encourage further support from donors and propel the Law School well through its goal. 
Fresh off its last capital campaign, which raised $476 million and concluded in 2008, the school has altered its strategies and lowered its goal so that it can again successfully fundraise without over-soliciting donors. The Law School campaign’s public phase is also two years shorter than Harvard’s University-wide effort.
And while most schools begin their campaign public phases with about half to two-thirds of their goals reached, the Law School has started further ahead—a fact that James A. Attwood acknowledged when he announced the figure at the launch last Friday.
Donors and fundraising officials say they are confident that this early success will translate into more momentum for the rest of the campaign.
“Now that we’re doing so well, I think more people will join the campaign with greater enthusiasm,” said Morgan Chu, one of the co-chairs of the Law School campaign and a former president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers. For Chu and others involved in the fundraising process, a successful quiet phase makes donating all the more worthwhile.
“If a campaign is materially below expectations at a given point in time, I think it would be more difficult to raise monies,” Chu said.
Peter L. Malkin ’55 agreed, writing in an email that “the unusually large [percent] of the goal achieved during the ‘Quiet Phase’ of the Law School campaign will encourage rather than deter other donors who will want to participate in a successful effort.”
Though reaching the goal may already seem a question of when, not if, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 said significantly exceeding a goal can also have its own benefits.
“Even if they set a goal that they felt was appropriate for the time, it can be certainly very morale boosting to crash through that goal,” she said. “And if they do that or when they do that, more power to them. And in some cases that can perhaps be inspiring [to] donors.”
Michael R. Klein, a member of the Law School dean’s advisory board and donor who already gave the school a $15 million gift,  predicted it will substantially exceed the goal. Klein said raising money for the campaign’s priorities—financial aid for students and clinical education—will be more important than just hitting or exceeding a numerical figure.
“They’ll exceed the goal. I wouldn’t be surprised to go 20 percent or 30 percent over the goal,” Klein said.
Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean of development and alumni relations, has said administrators will not raise the goal. And with only two years left in its abbreviated campaign, the Law School cannot rest on its laurels quite yet.
“The points look good on the scoreboard, but it’s halftime,” Chu said. “So we’ve got to keep our focus on doing everything we can to make sure we maximize our fundraising as much as possible.”

Despite deep cuts in federal support and poor endowment returns, Harvard reached a budgetary surplus of $62 million on revenues of $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2015, according to its annual financial report. The University’s net assets also rose to $44.6 billion. 
One of the major issues that Harvard faces financially is the decrease in federal funding for universities across the country. In FY 2015, federal support for University activities totaled $578 million, down 2 percent from the $592 million in FY 2014 and 16 percent from the all-time high of $686 million in FY 2011, according to the report, which was released on Thursday.
Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp said in a statement that private foundations and other non-federal sources have stepped up their contributions to minimize the damage to University operations in response to the federal grant cuts. In FY 2015, non-federal sponsored support was up 10 percent, against the 2 percent drop in federal aid.
Despite poorer year-over-year endowment returns, down from 15.7 percent to 5.8 percent, Thomas J. Hollister, Harvard’s vice president for finance, emphasized how crucial the endowment is for the University’s function.
In FY 2015, which ended on June 30, endowment income made available for operations made up 35 percent of the University’s total revenue, or $1.6 billion, an increase of 4 percent over FY 2014. Within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which includes both Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, endowment income plays an even more critical role, covering the costs of roughly 50 percent of all FAS activities.
On top of the 35 percent of University’s revenue provided via endowment income, annual current use gifts from donors pay for 10 percent of the University’s operations, according to the report.
Every year, Harvard withdraws a predetermined percentage of money from the endowment for operations purposes. The value of this annual withdrawal is typically targeted by the University between 5 percent and 5.5 percent of the year end market value of the endowment. This year, the percentage, or “pay out rate,” sat at 5.1 percent, down from 5.6 percent in FY 2014.
For FY 2015, University-wide expenses were up 4 percent to just under $4.5 billion. The increase was largely driven by increases and changes in wages and benefits for University employees, Lapp said. Salaries, wages, and benefits make up roughly 50 percent of Harvard’s expenditures.
In addition to expenses committed to employees, the University invested $467 million, roughly 10 percent of its total expenditures, on projects and acquisitions in FY 2015. These expenditures include major capital improvements, such as the renewal of Dunster House, as well as planning and design for the upcoming overhauls of the Smith Campus Center and Winthrop House.
This is the first Harvard annual financial report for Hollister, who took the position last May to criticism from student groups, such as the environmental group Divest Harvard, who decried his close ties to the fossil fuel industry. Hollister took over for Dan S. Shore, who left to become CFO of OnShape Inc.

One-hundred and twenty-three steps separate the main concourse of Harvard Stadium from the sparse press box tucked atop its roof. On a chilly September afternoon before football’s home opener against Brown, Allison L. Miller, an associate director of athletic communications, climbs each one, two interns in tow.
With football’s home opener against Brown then ahead, it’s a ritual familiar to Miller and her staff: haul boxes of programs, game notes, soft drinks, extension cords, and a printer to the “temporary” 1981 structure, before distributing media seating assignments to most of the 185 credentialed, checking statistics systems and preparing notes to walk tomorrow’s color commentators from Fox College Sports through this season’s major player and team storylines.
Yet adding a special wrinkle to the list, a New England Patriots home game the next day means the nearly 600 programs reserved for credentialed media are routed and delayed through Gillette Stadium, nearly an hour away, before hitting campus.
It’s only a small reminder of what Harvard’s athletic communications office faces daily in its quest to promote Harvard athletes and their teams amidst a market with a high ratio of major sports teams per capita.
As Miller said, “There’s a lot of noise that we have to cut through to get our message across.”
Like most of the weekly preparation Harvard’s athletic communications office devotes to game days, the bi-weekly press box setup and army of credentialed media inside it will go unnoticed by the 15,000 fans who watch football throttle Brown the next day. But it symbolizes the coordination effort behind the Division I athletic program with the most teams in the nation—an effort that spans 42 varsity teams, from external media relations to an internal multimedia production apparatus that far outpaces its Ivy League peers.
“We say we’re telling Harvard’s story and putting it in its best light,” said Timothy J. Williamson, Harvard’s director of athletic communications. “It’s a lot of balancing when you have that many schedules to look at.”
When Williamson started at Harvard in 2007, he was the youngest of six to balance those schedules. Today, one staff member, two interns, and a multimedia director later, he leads a team of sports information directors, or SIDs, atop one of the busiest communications operations in the Ivy League.
Harvard’s athletic communications office is large, complex, influential, and often overlooked. Behind the scenes, it significantly affects both the way the media covers and the way the public views Harvard athletics.
On any given day in athletic communications, a drone may fly above Harvard Stadium to capture a “Crimson Football Skills” feature video on how to block a punt. An SID might organize the minute-by-minute video board content lineup for the team’s upcoming game. Others might interview athletes for “senior perspective” videos, update a Crimson sports Snapchat feed, or plan network coverage of a basketball scrimmage.
The changing face of a public relations industry today—one that relies as much on proprietary multimedia content as traditional story-pitching to the news media—pulls Williamson and his staff in several directions. While representatives from Harvard have long put out press releases about their teams’ performances in games, now there is more emphasis on creating alternative content to promote them. 
“As we continue to move away from extended, written articles and releases, there is an ever-growing consumer reliability on visuals. This includes infographics, promotional pieces, video features, highlights...anything related,” said Brock Malone, an SID who represented Harvard at this year’s College Sports Information Directors of America convention.
Malone, whose first tour at Harvard was as an intern five years ago, is also one of its newest hires. The full-time communications staff has grown from eight to 10 since Williamson came on as director. Today, SIDs manage up to nine to 11 teams each, responsible for creating the full spectrum of promotional content—feature videos, season previews, game highlights, and freshman and senior athlete perspective videos, among others—that populates the department’s social media outlets for each of their teams.
All eight Ivy League teams have designated athletic communications offices, but Harvard’s far outpaces each of its peers in content and exposure. At 10 total members, the office is the largest in the league, although Harvard also has the most teams.
The staff also produces more content: At the Harvard-Brown football game, a walk through the press box showed the discrepancy in media content between both programs was almost as visible as that on the field. Brown’s game notes were 15 pages long; Harvard’s, professionally printed and emblazoned with the new departmental tagline Miller helped create—“Academic Integration and Competitive Excellence”—nearly doubled that. This does not include the glossy programs distributed, like at every Harvard home game, to fans and the media—a commitment Williamson said is rare among Ivy League departments. 
When Williamson arrived at Harvard, sports information looked very different. “When I started here, we were still doing printed media guides, no video channel, streamed a couple of events but no highlights,” Williamson said.
Now, instead of just print materials, the Athletic Department promotes its teams through a range of mediums, with an emphasis online. “It’s been interesting to see how far we’ve gone from print to digital,” Williamson added.
A critical point in that transition came in early 2013, when Harvard became the first Ivy League athletics department to hire a full-time multimedia director. “I was starting from close to scratch,” said Imry Halevi, who was hired by Kurt Svoboda, Williamson’s predecessor, and has since seen two interns hired under him.
Halevi, in short order, gave Harvard athletics a league-leading multimedia presence. The communications office now boasts a YouTube channel with more than 6.1 million views and various feature videos uploaded daily, popular Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram platforms, and live streaming capabilities across 32 of the school’s 42 varsity teams. By comparison, Yale Athletics’s YouTube channel has about 850,000 views, and the average view count of the seven Ivy League athletics channels besides Harvard is about 380,000. Twitter and Facebook followers tell a similar story.
Halevi has a big job: He has technical responsibilities, but he also creates promotional content, editing videos and creating commercials, and does outreach throughout the Ivy League. His interns take on some content creation, freeing time for such “big picture planning and coordination with the Ivy League.” He has accordingly spent time both finding ways to expand streaming content to the Ivy League Digital Network, or ILDN, and finding TV partners to take his game productions.
The whiteboards surrounding his Murr Center desk, lined with schematics of camera positioning around an outdoor track, tell that story. He notes he will present soon to ILDN peers on streaming ideas for new sports, including track and field. 
Meanwhile, the department is trying to expand its external streaming operation even further. By default, Harvard’s streaming goes to the ILDN, but it is “trying to find other avenues that have more built-in viewers,” such as ESPN3 and NESN, Halevi said.
“We want to increase our exposure in general,” Halevi said.
In recent years, expanding outside media interest in Harvard sports has further pushed Harvard’s communications network to grow as it responds to requests from journalists.
For Williamson, the global frenzy around Jeremy Lin ’10 and his rise to stardom on the New York Knicks in 2012—known as “Linsanity” nationwide—marked a turning point. He said that time was among his busiest on the job.
“I would wake up and have 200 emails from all over the place,” he said.
In the world of public relations, presenting Crimson sports to the outside world shifts between feeding external media demand and publishing internal multimedia content to promote the full range of 42 varsity sports.
“Part of our job is reactionary, and part of our job is supposed to be proactive,” Williamson said.
The athletic communications office, according to Williamson and his colleagues, likes to focus on the latter—publicizing teams through their own materials—when they can. Miller and her colleagues know well the “proactive” part of getting media attention in a saturated Boston sports market.
As Andrew Chesebro, associate director of athletic communications alongside Miller, characterizes the department’s challenge: “In this market we can’t just go out there and say our basketball team is doing well. What other reasons make our team interesting? That’s our challenge and our opportunity.”
To Chesebro, who serves as primary contact for men’s basketball, among six other sports, the answer lies in Harvard’s academic credentials. He said the communications office can leverage Harvard’s reputation as an academic institution to drum up interest.
“Where we have opportunities is that we are Harvard—we are so much more focused on the academics first than the athletics,” he said. “You really can have the best of both worlds, and that’s what our coaches have been stressing for as long as they’ve been here. So I see that as an opportunity. We just have to be strategic in how we are pitching that.” 
As the department’s rapid buildup of multimedia capability under Halevi suggests, however, it is serious about promoting Harvard’s teams through its own content as well. That, according to communications officials, serves as a key tool for both attracting outside attention and for recruiting.
Said Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise of the communications office’s focus, “Not only do they have technical capabilities, they broadcast what we do and tell our story in-between the action through feature videos and what our student-athletes and programs do off the field.”
The feature videos, which each varsity team is guaranteed, are one of the department’s newest and most visible multimedia productions. The communications office is not independent—coaching staffs choose their topics of focus, according to Miller, that they think will best present their teams.
“Coaches have a lot of say in what we do and how we present their program, which is the way it should be,” she said, citing this year’s women’s rugby team “Why Rugby?” feature video—including interviews with players about their decision to play and B-roll footage of practice—as a boon for recruiting.
In the department’s emphasis on internal multimedia content Williamson sees an opportunity to attract the attention of news outlets. 
“There’s a whole traditional pitching-the-story-to-the-media of something—a volunteer experience, someone, up for the Rhodes scholarship, et cetera,” Williamson said. “But now through doing these things here with someone writing about it in their blog, tweeting about it, doing a feature video about it, there are ways we’re trying to get the story out now.”
“The media is more likely to pick it up, especially because they’ll have a scope of the story, which often makes it easier for them to frame it,” he added.
Making these videos, hundreds of special interviews, athlete blogs, highlights, and game and season recaps is a task that requires SIDs to wear many hats.
Williamson, for his part, oversees the entire department, acts as its main spokesperson, and is also the point person for several sports: football, women’s lacrosse, wrestling, and men’s and women’s fencing. For those sports, he is tasked with putting together game notes and coordinating feature videos and photos, plus working with outside media outlets who cover the teams.
And on the multimedia front, the department’s commitment to broadcast every home game live means Halevi and his team are in high demand. “Even if we have seven games at the same time, which happens, we provide coverage for everyone,” Halevi said.
“Pound for pound, we have the best staff anywhere,” Williamson said.
Williamson said he will never forget his busiest week as an SID early in his tenure at Harvard in November 2008. He was the most junior member of the communications office, and two of his teams (men’s and women’s soccer) both made their respective NCAA tournaments, while another (women’s hockey) was in season.
All in the span of a week around Thanksgiving, Williamson staffed a women’s hockey game at home, drove to UMass to staff the men’s soccer tournament, and returned to Harvard for another hockey game. He also flew across the country—to Tampa, for men’s soccer, and to Minnesota, for women’s hockey. Through all of this, he missed The Game.
“I went to games in Western Mass, Tampa, Minnesota, and Harvard all within a week,” Williamson said, still with a note of incredulity.
Through the noise that week, Williamson noticed a face in the press box at the UMass soccer game busily recording stats for the home team: Allison Miller, then in college there. She would join his office sometime later.
As much it shapes the image of Crimson sports to the outside world, Harvard’s athletic communications staff also significantly affects the athletes and media it interacts with on a day-to-day basis, regulating how reporters cover teams.
According to the Athletic Department’s media policy, all press requests must pass through Williamson’s office. Any members of the news media, the policy says, must obtain permission from an SID to speak with student-athletes “so as not to interfere with the students’ academic schedules.”
This policy is not unique among larger Division I schools, and The Crimson’s student journalists often interview athletes from some sports without going through a communications official first.
But for some of the higher profile teams, SIDs at Harvard manage requests and availability more carefully, weighing when to grant interviews with players and coaches to news outlets. Chesebro, as primary contact for men’s basketball, notes that “a substantial amount of my time is handling requests, because a lot more people want to focus on us and feature us.” 
“A lot of it is figuring out what are good opportunities and what are opportunities that we can pass on to be efficient with everyone’s time,” he said.
Often, this means journalists are funnelled to regular, weekly media days following team practices. Chesebro said he tries to push media requests until the next regularly scheduled availabilities due to players’ academic and athletic commitments.
“Once a team is in season, it’s much harder to ask for a bigger block of time,” said Dick Friedman, who leads football coverage for Harvard Magazine. “[Head Football] Coach Murphy has things scheduled so strictly that you can’t go and say, ‘I want two hours with somebody,’ ‘I need this or that.’ You really have to be realistic, I think, about what you are going to get.”
Williamson promotes a department-wide policy of minimal demands on athletes’ media time: “We have the philosophy that we are not going to force anybody to speak, and we’re not going to tell anybody they can’t speak.”
Williamson and his staff also train teams in dealing with the media—“media training in the sense that if people reach out to you, come through us, don’t ever feel like you have to answer anything, we’ll coach you through it,” Williamson said. In some cases, particularly for some of the higher-profile teams, SIDs offer “heavier media training,” given that some teams have NCAA-mandated availabilities and press conferences which can be broadcast locally and nationally.
As elaborate as the system might seem, Harvard communications officials suggest that Harvard has a relatively strict interview request policy because the program gets more media interest than some peers. Williamson counts multiple stories in his tenure—from women’s hockey coach Katey Stone’s trip to the Olympic Games to Zack Hodges’s road to the National Football League—that flooded his office with requests. In a given week, his team hands out an average of almost 200 credentials for football games, 30 to 40 for men’s basketball, or 15 to 20 for men’s hockey. At last year’s edition of The Game, which hosted 50 from NBC Sports and an additional 75 for ESPN College GameDay, the office issued 400 credentials. 
“There are so many people externally reaching out to you, and you still have your regular job,” Williamson said.
Indeed, for those who think of Harvard’s research and academics first, the demands on the the athletic communications staff might seem surprising. The 42 varsity sports, though, can be taxing.
Miller has more perspective on this than most, having spent four years in an SID role at Rutgers before Williamson hired her in 2013. For the University of Massachusetts graduate who crossed paths with Williamson in a soccer press box in 2008, Harvard is a change of scenery. Among other national storylines, having to handle the Mike Rice saga—in which the Rutgers men’s basketball coach was fired in 2013 for abusive behavior toward players—helped motivate her decision to come to Harvard.
“It’s a big difference—one of the things working here, versus at Rutgers, is that there’s a lot more freedom,” Miller said. “We don’t have to teach our players much; they give credit to their teammates and coaches. I used to have to do a lot more micromanaging.”
Still, that’s not to say that Harvard athletics has never seen scandal that communications officials had to manage. In 2012, a number of athletes—some high-profile—were implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest in recent memory.
Williamson declined to comment on his office’s handling of that incident, which prompted roughly 70 students across the College to take time off, but it did attract significant media attention after Harvard’s central communications office announced the investigation. Sports Illustrated first reported the story that the co-captains of the men’s basketball team would withdraw from school in connection with the case, prompting a flood of coverage. And as individual athletes prepared for lineup changes in the wake of the cheating investigation, several reported fearing repercussions for speaking about it to The Crimson. When The Crimson followed up on the case a year later, coaches were instructed to direct inquiries to the communications office.
Outside of irregular news events, professional reporters acknowledge that players’ availability is limited partly because of their academic commitments. By nature, the Ivy League sets different parameters on media involvement than other conferences. Craig Larson of the Boston Globe, for his part, described Williamson’s response to his media requests as “very accommodating.”
Added Friedman, who before Harvard Magazine spent two decades at Sports Illustrated: “This isn’t professional ball, or even FBS ball. These are highly scheduled student athletes with high course loads and very busy lives, so you cannot impose on people like that.”
As for Crimson teams themselves, media coverage can also potentially provide a competitive advantage. “I think anytime there is large community-building type media coverage, if benefits all teams,” said Williamson, noting that many coaches have showed prospective athletes cuts of coverage from ESPN’s famous GameDay show when the program came to campus for The Game last year.
“We want to give every team as much attention as we can, but we have to pick and choose what we’re doing in order to make it the best product for everybody,” Williamson said. “We feel that we have a good story to tell, and the media buys into that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Revenge will be on the mind of the No. 8/7 Harvard women’s ice hockey team this weekend as it faces Eastern College Athletic Conference rival No. 4/4 Clarkson on Friday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (0-1-0, 0-1-0 ECAC) was denied its first outright ECAC title since 2008-09 last season by the Golden Knights (9-0-0), which won, 1-0, in Cambridge, ruining Harvard’s Senior Day festivities and claiming a share of the conference championship. After playing Clarkson, the Crimson will host Saint Lawrence (3-5-1) on Saturday in the second leg of a weekend doubleheader.
“You’re always bitter, but at the same time, it’s a new year and it’s a new season,” junior defenseman Briana Mastel said. “We’re looking to make changes this year, [such as] going into every game and playing a full 60 minutes. Our effort level needs to be up the whole game.”
After finishing up preseason play with an exhibition win over McGill, Harvard opened up its season with a 2-1 defeat at Dartmouth. It was the team’s first opening game loss in 15 years..
“I think last week was a bit of a wake up call,” senior forward Miye D’Oench said. “But Dartmouth is a good team, Clarkson is a good team, so no matter who you’re playing, you have to come at it with the same amount of focus. With our team going to the national championship game, everyone will be on your back, so you have to be prepared week-in, week-out.”
D’Oench notched a power play goal in the loss to the Big Green, but the Crimson’s man-advantage unit will face a stern test this weekend against Clarkson’s conference-leading penalty kill. The Golden Knights have killed 23 of 24 penalties successfully this season.
Having already swept the University of Vermont, Boston University, and the University of New Hampshire in weekend back-to-back series, Clarkson comes into this game brimming with confidence. The offense has scored an average of 4.0 goals per game while the defense has allowed just 1.3, and the Golden Knights have converted on 22.3 percent of their power play opportunities.
The leader of Clarkson’s high-powered attack is junior forward Cayley Mercer, who tops all ECAC players in goals (10), shots (60), points (17), and hat tricks (two). The reigning ECAC player of the week, who notched six goals last weekend against New Hampshire, will be a handful for Harvard’s defense, a fact the coaches and players are wary of.
“Covering someone like [Mercer] is all about playing with confidence,” Mastel said. “You have to play with the knowledge that you can play with anyone in the league as long as you’re playing your position well. Body position is huge, and then just having confidence, whether it be in your defensive partner or in your forward line, whoever is out there with you. When we all have confidence in each other is when we play our best.”
Mastel, who will be partnered with freshman defenseman Kaitlin Tse for the first time this upcoming weekend, and her teammates will then line up against Saint Lawrence on Saturday afternoon. After sputtering out of the gate to an 0-5-1 start, the Saints have won three games on the trot and will look to continue their strong spell against the Crimson.
The Harvard offense, limited to just 21 shots by the Big Green last week, will look to kick into high gear this weekend, especially against the porous Saint Lawrence defense. The Saints have allowed four goals and 33.6 shots per game to opposing offenses.
The Crimson will be without goalkeeper and captain Emerance Maschmeyer this weekend, who is travelling with the Canadian women’s national team to Sweden for the Four Nations Cup. The Alberta native, a preseason all-ECAC selection, will be replaced by either Molly Tissenbaum or Brianna Laing, both juniors. Whoever finds herself between the posts will have big shoes to fill, with Maschmeyer making 31 saves against Dartmouth, a number of them at point-blank range. Still, the team has confidence in the reserves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 30, 2015, at 3:05 a.m.
There are few Harvard athletes as decorated as Zack Hodges ‘15, the first two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Ivy League history, who was added to the St. Louis Rams practice squad this past weekend.
With outside linebacker Alec Ogletree headed to injured reserve, the Rams picked up Hodges as part of a roster reshuffle. The former Crimson standout signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent this spring before being released.
The 6’2”, 250-pound defensive end racked up a program record 26 sacks during his time at Harvard while adding 41.5 tackles for a loss and 118 total tackles. He was part of last season’s undefeated, Ivy League champions, recording 8.5 sacks as part of a Crimson defense that allowed just 12.3 points per game.
Despite excelling as a down lineman in college, Hodges will likely transition to an outside linebacker role in the NFL due to his relatively diminutive frame. Scouting reports often tout his pass-rushing skills. NFL.com wrote that he “[g]ets upfield with good burst after snap. Good speed to the ball when in back-side pursuit, and can plant his foot and turn the corner at a tight angle when rushing. Loose, athletic hips. Spin move can become a featured pass-rush weapon.”
Hodges was hoping to hear his name called late in this spring’s draft in Chicago, but ended up coming to terms as a priority free agent with the Colts. A 2015 Senior Bowl participant, Hodges spent the entire spring and much of the summer with the Colts before being waived on August 31 as part of the team’s final wave of preseason cuts.
Hodges’ background came to the forefront last spring during pre-draft workouts, when outlets from the New York Times to the Bleacher Report recounted his difficult past and subsequent path to Harvard. Hodges dealt with tragedy after tragedy, losing his father, grandfather, and mother all before the end of his junior year, struggling with homelessness and poverty throughout.
After losing his father to a brain tumor during infancy, Hodges was raised by his grandfather and mother, but the former, an influential part of Hodges’s life, passed away before his freshman year of high school. He lost his mother to a stroke during his junior year, exactly 15 years after the death of his father.
Instead of allowing his history of tragedy to limit him, Hodges ended up at Phillips Exeter Academy for his senior year, where he was recruited to play under Harvard football coach Tim Murphy.
This story has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 30, 2015

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Nearly one month ago, Harvard women’s volleyball easily handed rivals Penn and Princeton straight-set losses. In that critical weekend sweep, the Crimson not only shut both the Quakers and the Tigers out, but also snapped Penn’s four-match winning streak.
The Crimson (10-8, 6-2 Ivy) will look to repeat its performance from four weeks ago as it travels first to take on Penn (9-11, 3-5), followed by the Tigers (9-8, 4-4) for the second time this season.
The Crimson looks to maintain its shared position with Dartmouth atop the Ivy League rankings after a pivotal three-set victory over the Big Green last weekend. In this millennium, no team has won the Ivy League title with more than two losses within the conference.
“I think we’re all really satisfied with the way we played [Dartmouth],” freshman Christina Cornelius said. “It was a really successful game.”
With two losses already under its belt, every game for Harvard counts.
“I think the most important thing for us is to play to our tempo,” said senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “We have a pretty fast offense, so focusing on every person working towards whatever goal will be the key to beating Penn and Princeton.”
Wallace played a critical role in ousting both teams earlier this season. While the senior led Harvard with 13 kills, Penn’s top scorers, seniors Alexis Genske and Alex Caldwell, notched 13 combined. The last time the Crimson took on the Quakers, Penn showed a season-low performance in both hitting percentage and kills.
Since then, Caldwell has proven a dangerous offensive force. In the Quakers’ game against Princeton last week, Caldwell recorded a team-high of 11 kills, reaching double-digits for the fifth time this season.
The Quakers have had a hard time securing victories this season, however. Winning only one of its five matches since its matchup against the Crimson, Penn is currently tied with Columbia for sixth place in the conference.
Princeton, on the other hand, has lost only one of its past four matchups and stands at a tie for fourth place in the league. After its most recent victory over Penn, two Tigers—freshman setter Claire Nussbaum and senior outside Kendall Peterkin—received Ivy League honors for outstanding individual play. Nussbaum recorded career highs in both assists and digs, while Peterkin claimed 22 kills, marking her 14th match with more than 20 kills.
Peterkin is a well-known offensive powerhouse for Princeton and is currently riding a wave of momentum after the team’s last game. The two-time All-Ivy League honors recipient earned her 14th 20+ kill tally of her career against the Quakers.
In Princeton’s last faceoff with Harvard, Peterkin managed only eight kills, less than her average of 13 kills per game at the time. But this time around, she may prove to be a force to be reckoned with on the court.
Harvard’s own improving offensive play will attempt to counteract strong showings from Penn and Princeton.
“I think our team is very athletic,” Wallace said. “We’ve been able to push our offense in a way that we haven’t before previously, so that’s definitely been a strength of our team.”
The Crimson tied its season low in attack errors last weekend, ending the game with a hitting percentage of 30 percent compared to Dartmouth’s eight percent. The week before, Corie Bain recorded her fifth triple-double of the season, and Wallace registered her second-straight double-double.
“We’ve been doing a really good job of staying engaged, staying really focused and making quick play,” Wallace said.
To add to its strength on the offensive side, the team has been working on increasing communication between the front row and the back row. The squad’s mental acumen and focus will come under the microscope as the season winds down.
“We’re really excited, ready to do our best, and overall I think we’re ready for the road ahead,” Wallace said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring ting ting-a-ling too
C’mon it’s lovely weather
For a—
What did you say it’s not that time of year yet? Are you sure? But this weekend I’ll be bitterly cold outside, and Harvard Stadium will be filled with red and green jerseys and supporters. Surely it must be Christmas?
Oh, I guess you have a point—the game is set for Oct. 30, not Dec. 25. I mean, we have the Crimson and the Big Green, how can you possibly get more festive than that? Aside from the overtly tangible details, this weekend will certainly start to feel a lot like Christmas, at least for this reporter.
Santa must have come a few months early this year, because I’m going to get the best present I could have asked for in Friday night’s clash between Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) and Dartmouth (6-0, 3-0). You see, this is not only supposed to be a dogfight in that reminds you why you’re a football fan to begin with, in the heart-pounding, anticipatory, will-this-last-second-field-goal-be-good sort of way, but it might be the only dogfight I get to cover all year.
Now, in my third year of reporting on this team, I know the drill. I know that the first few weeks are always the warm-up, the dull end of the season. But the dominance is starting to feel a little ridiculous.
If you look at opponents’ scoring over the first halves of each game—the only time in every contest thus far you can be certain that the first-string defense is still on the field—they’ve amassed a total of 20 points in 180 minutes of play, or roughly equivalent to 3.3 points per half. And these aren’t exactly defensive struggles either, when the Harvard offense is pouring out omore than 40 points a game.
After five weeks of ho-hum blowouts, I was excited for last week’s tilt with Princeton. They told me it would be the hardest game yet. They told me it might even go down to the final snap (they being Crimson coach Tim Murphy to another reporter and Harvard players to me). Despite the Tigers losing to a Brown team that looked impotent a few weeks ago against the Crimson, I chalked it up to the Bears having a fluke game in Cambridge. I was still pumped.
They were right until they were wrong. The game was in contention for about 29 minutes, until Harvard scored on five consecutive drives. Suddenly, it wasn’t a seven-point game, but a 35-point rout. Yawn.
I’m determined to cover at least one last nail-biter before I graduate, however, and this weekend is my best chance at that. A Friday night game, under the lights, between two undefeated teams that pits the two most prolific offenses in the league against the two toughest defenses? It might as well be bundled in cheesy wrapping paper with a bow on top.
The bar is set low, fellas. Don’t let my Very Merry Christmas down.
DARTMOUTH AT HARVARD
So Santa Claus isn’t coming to town. But Big Green quarterback Dalyn Williams is, and who better to challenge the Crimson’s 20-game winning streak than the preseason pick for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year? And who better to challenge the best offensive line in the league than a Dartmouth defense that has 18 sacks to its name and leads the Ancient Eight with nine picks?
This will be the first real test for the 2015 Harvard team. Yes, I know I’ve said that before, but I mean it this time-pinky swear.
Prediction: Harvard 35, Dartmouth 31
PENN AT BROWN
If you’d told me at the beginning of the season that this game would be a battle for third place midway through the season, I’d have sent you to the crazy house. But somehow, after this week, one of these two teams will share the same league record as either Harvard or Dartmouth.
After being pulled in the second quarter of the Crimson’s massacre of the Bears on a 2-for-7 passing performance that included a pick, Brown starting quarterback Marcus Fuller has quietly ascended the play-calling Ivy ladder, surpassing Dalyn Williams to take the top passing spot in the league with 309.3 yards per game.
And despite the departure of longtime coach Al Bagnoli, the Quakers—in a dramatic turnaround from last year’s underperformance—are surpassing expectations in all facets, especially in an explosive defensive front that leads the Ancient Eight with 19 sacks.
Nevertheless, Brown’s momentum from the surge of four straight wins will be too much for Penn come Saturday in this matchup of, quite surprisingly, the two dark horses in this year’s title race.
Prediction: Brown 42, Penn 38
COLUMBIA AT YALE
How does one recover from two straight conference losses? Schedule in Columbia, of course, for that much-needed boost of morale.
A preseason pick to finish near the top of the standings, the Bulldogs have
floundered so far, getting clobbered by Dartmouth in Week Four and dropping last week’s contest to Penn after a few unfortunate interceptions from quarterback Morgan Roberts.
Roberts and co. can’t afford to be careless again, however—this Lion appears to have grown some claws since last year (and the year before). Games against Columbia are no longer gimmes. Heck, Al Bagnoli’s new team has already won a game—a feat unfamiliar to this squad since 2012—and even put up an impressive fight against Dartmouth last week, losing by only four in Hanover.
I’m not ballsy enough to pick Columbia, however, due to a still lackluster offense and the fact that the players might suffer heart attacks from shock from winning two games in the same month. Yale will pull it together enough to scrape out a victory in New Haven.
Prediction: Yale 17, Columbia 6
CORNELL AT PRINCETON
David Archer hasn’t quite come out of his sophomore slump in his third year as head coach at Cornell—the Big Red’s offense is about as potent as Columbia’s and the defense is worse. The result of this has been a winless season so far, and it’s unlikely that Archer’s squad will find its first victory in New Jersey, where a hungry Princeton team will be looking for redemption after last week’s throttling in Cambridge.
I can only think of one positive for Archer and this Cornell team heading into Saturday’s slaughter—at least they get to leave Ithaca for the weekend?
Prediction: Princeton 38, Cornell 10

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Ivy League football has neither an end-of-season playoff nor a championship game, which means that all regular season matchups mean something. If you lose, you risk dropping off the map; if you win, you come one weekend closer to an Ancient Eight title.
This Friday night at home, the Harvard football team (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) will play the most important 60 minutes of its season, squaring off against Dartmouth (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) in a matchup that seems destined to decide the Ivy League champion.
“Every game is important because we know that we get every team’s best shot,” said senior offensive lineman Cole Toner. “But this is the big one.”
The stakes have been building ever since August, when media pundits picked the Crimson and the Big Green to finish one-two in the Ivy League. Since then the two sides have fulfilled those preseason expectations, largely speeding from blowout to blowout in advance of Friday’s showdown.
Forget Harvard-Yale. In the 2015 football season, this is the Game.
“Your senior year, every game, especially in conference, is a championship game,” senior safety Scott Peters said. “[If] you can’t get excited for this one, then something’s wrong with you.”
Last season, in Hanover, N.H., Harvard dealt the Big Green its only league loss—a 23-12 defeat in which Crimson running back Paul Stanton, then a junior, rushed for 180 yards. That result left Dartmouth’s hopes in limbo until the final weekend of play, when Harvard beat Yale to take the Ancient Eight Championship and leave the Big Green alone in second place.
Old grudges die hard, and Dartmouth will take the field this weekend with lingering resentment from 2014, not to mention the emotional baggage of 11 straight losses to the Crimson.
This long winless streak reflects the historical mediocrity of the Big Green, but all signs indicate that this year is different. Dartmouth has not started a season 6-0 since 1996, and the 2015 team boasts NFL-caliber skill, deep experience, and undeniable hunger.
Senior quarterback Dalyn Williams possesses all three traits. The dual-threat play-caller has averaged 318 yards of total offense a game and thrown 14 touchdowns compared to one pick-in short: nearly flawless.
Along with Williams, the Preseason Offensive Player of the Year, the Big Green has the Preseason Defensive Player of the year in linebacker Will McNamara. He anchors a defense that ranks second in all of college football with nine points allowed per game.
The Crimson ranks first with seven.
On these steely defenses, both teams return enviable depth. Exactly half of the Preseason All-Ivy Defense hails from Dartmouth, and all seven of these players are seniors.
“They’ve had kids playing on that defense since my freshman year,” Toner said. “They’re the most physical defense we play for sure, but I think we’re ready.”
Meanwhile Harvard returns seven of 11 starters from a 2014 unit that led the country in scoring defense.
Were it not for high-powered offenses, Friday’s matchup might seem fate for a 0-0 draw. But the Big Green and the Crimson also have the two highest -scoring attacks in the Ancient Eight at 34 and 44 points a game, respectively.
While Dalyn Williams reigns as the best quarterback in the conference, the Crimson’s senior starter Scott Hosch has never lost a college game.
On the ground, Stanton has returned with a fury, putting up 103 yards a game and nearly two touchdowns a game.
But the same depth defines the Dartmouth attack. A committee of runners has totaled 147 yards per outing, and senior wide receiver Victor Williams has almost matched this productivity on his own, accumulating 655 total receiving yards for the Big Green.
In a bizarre twist, neither team’s offensive scheme will be entirely novel because the two teams scrimmaged each other during preseason. This Dartmouth-Harvard tune-up is an annual tradition—and according to Peters, the score is always close.
However, preseason snaps can hardly serve to prepare players for the 60-minute battle that will take place on Friday—a battle in which bitterness is in the background, perfection is in peril, and the Ivy League title is on the line.
“We know that this is our Ivy League championship basically,” Peters said. “This is why we do all the winter workouts and all the spring ball.... It’s for games like this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With just three games remaining in the schedule, the Harvard men’s soccer team faces arguably its most difficult, and most important, test of the season in a match that could either open or slam shut the door to the Ivy League title.
The Crimson (7-5-2, 3-1-0 Ivy) welcome defending conference champion and No. 24 Dartmouth (8-4-1, 4-0-0) to Jordan Field this Saturday as the team looks to get back on track against the current Ancient Eight leader.
Harvard goes into this match in a similar pattern as last year, as the Crimson suffered a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Princeton for its first Ivy loss of the season for the second consecutive year. Last year, Harvard followed up its loss by drawing 1-1 in Hanover, essentially losing control of its Ancient Eight fate. This year, the Crimson need a victory against a Dartmouth squad that already has a one‑game advantage over second-place Harvard.
“It’s a must win game,” captain Mark Ashby said. “It’s going to be a great game and we’re really excited. We have to win especially because we lost that game to Princeton…every game has to be a win now in the Ivy League.”
Though a victory would place the Crimson back in control of its Ivy fate, the task is easier said than done. The Big Green comes with an eight-game unbeaten streak in conference play and has won six of its last seven games, conceding a mere four goals in that timeframe and only one against Ivy opponents so far.
The Harvard offense–which has averaged a league high two goals per game in Ancient Eight play–will have to be on point to get past senior keeper Stefan Cleveland and the Dartmouth defense.
Cleveland has been the best keeper in the Ivies, posting a .929 save percentage and a mere 0.25 goals per game in conference games, while the defense has allowed only 3.25 shots on goal thus far.
Getting clean shots will be a priority for a Crimson offense that has struggled with efficiency. Though Harvard has managed to get off 52 shots in conference play so far, only 15 of them have been on target.
“It’s a commitment to shooting the ball on goal,” junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “It’s a conscious decision to say ‘I’m not going to try to aim for the top corner of the net every shot’ because it’s a smaller margin of error if you miss instead of aiming for a bigger target just to the left or right of the goalkeeper.”
While the Dartmouth defense has been an almost impermeable wall, the offense has struggled at times, an aspect that will be to the Crimson’s success.
The Big Green has taken 53 shots in Ivy play so far‑26 of which have been on target–but has only been able to find the back of the net five times, with five different players each obtaining a goal.
Communication will be key for the Harvard defense to stifle the Dartmouth attack, as miscommunications between senior netminder Evan Mendez and the Crimson backline allowed a then-stagnant Princeton attack to slot three goals past Mendez.
Ashby emphasized the importance of communication, particularly by junior center-backs Daniel Smith and Alex Leondis, as a pivotal factor in holding strong versus the Big Green.
“It’s never going to hurt to over-communicate,” Ashby said. “Making sure that [Smith and Leondis] are explaining where everyone should be [and] keeping our back four even.”
Though there are details that need to be ironed out, the team doesn’t believe any drastic changes are necessary to come out with the victory.
With the Crimson’s confidence increasing after every game, Wheeler-Omiunu and Ashby both believe the team looks strong despite the loss against Princeton.
“[The approach] doesn’t change,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “It’s just another game, it’s the game that’s in front of us next and that’s how we look at every game. We don’t look past it.”

So we all heard that our most beloved Harvard Square establishments (read: where to go when the dhall makes you depressed) are soon closing soon. We all have really strong feelings about this, and we decided to stir the pot further by asking Harvard students an intensely contentious question– which closure are you sadder about, B.good or Clover?

Earlier this week, the College Events Board posted a survey asking students to suggest artists for Yardfest, the spring end-of-semester concert. They’ve also set up a series of meetings with members of the selection committee, so students can voice who they want to join the ranks of Jessie J, Janelle Monae, Tyga, and even the Wu Tang Clan. (If you’re interested, those meetings take place on October 30th from 6-7 in Quincy Dhall, November 3rd from 12-2 in Annenberg, and November 4th from 6-7 in Currier Dhall.)
In response to the CEB’s call for artist suggestions, Al Corvah ’18 created a Facebook event called “Fetty Wap for Yardfest!” encouraging students to vote for the rapper, famous for hits like “Trap Queen,” “679,” and “Again.” As of this writing, over 500 students had RSVP-ed as ‘attending’ to the event, with an additional 800-some invited.
Why Fetty Wap? According to Corvah, Fetty “clearly has great crossover appeal, and can satisfy a large base of people even though he's relatively new…[he] has novelty, relevance, AND affordability on his side.”
Corvah highlights the success of the rapper’s album this year and claims that Fetty, unlike previous performers, can uniquely energize “a bunch of loud, drunk Harvard students who just finished a few midterms and want to turn up before having to get back to work for finals.” He’s not wrong– did you go to a single party last semester that didn’t play ‘Trap Queen’? And how many times have you gotten down to “My Way” or “Again” this year?
So if you’ve ever found yourself drunk and sad on a Saturday night, singing “679” like this girl, or if you just want to say “hey what’s up hello” to Fetty Wap this April, then fill out the CEB’s survey by November 5th at midnight. If Fetty’s not really your type, or you’re a major classic rock fan, fill out the survey and suggest your own artist.
And hey, if anyone wants to start a “Taylor Swift for Yardfest” event, you can count me in. Until then, Fetty’s got my vote.
