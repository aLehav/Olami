After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I sit down in front of my wooden desk, words flying around me like little yellow butterflies. They follow me all the time as I scurry through Harvard Yard, recoiling from the unforgiving cold. They’re eager to land on a piece of paper, like the old days, but they usually have to settle for a Word document. I usually have an idea for a piece in the back of my mind, bubbling, waiting to burst into existence with these meandering words. It’s perfect timing when I have an op-ed due for the Editorial Board, the best excuse to not do my tedious problem sets and carry on with my thoughts. It feels like it all comes together when I open the word processor, my fingers grazing the smooth keyboard with the words preparing to land.
Then I remember I’m at Harvard, and the butterflies flutter away. The sizzling ideas dissipate and I stare into the screen, paralyzed with Crimson block.
It’s an interesting condition, a special kind of writer’s block that I’ve encountered only in Cambridge, between the terracotta bricks of Wigglesworth Hall and the majestic pillars of Widener Library. The images that once flowed effortlessly congeal. And just like that, the guy who gloated about having strong opinions runs out of things to say.
In any other place, in any other circumstance, I could probably find other writers to sympathize with me. But this is Harvard, this is The Crimson. The old sheet must keep flying, and the never-ending string of fabulous op-eds convinces me that here ideas never clot.
Of course, this is when self-doubt seeps in. Maybe I’m just a mediocre writer, one that only ever thinks about writing but never quite gets to it. Maybe a language barrier impedes my Spanish-wired brain from effectively expressing itself. This wouldn’t be surprising, but I don’t want to wallow in self-pity here; I like to think I’m a good writer. When I write privately, late in the night after ignoring my other work, words flow effortlessly. Whether in Spanish or English, I’m able to create pieces that I like to think are not half-bad.
For my ego’s sake, I’ve come to the conclusion that Crimson block is a result of the highly pressurized Harvard bubble. More than a reflection of my insecurities, Crimson block epitomizes the never-ending struggle of Harvard students’ quest to be the best. I always read the warnings on college admission forms, but I never expected the compulsion to compare to be so real. And so, even with a completion-based comp, The Crimson felt to me like a competition. I hoped to get my pieces published, but that never happened. I would read the magnificent op-eds by fellow compers, and I would understand why mine didn’t get published. Mine weren’t very good. And this realization was the inception of my Crimson block.
It would be ridiculous to ask people to stop competing. In most cases, competition is a positive thing — the fuel of the innovation machine. Citius, Altius, Fortius. Competition and comparison are what make us great in the eyes of the world. Harvard is no different.
Still, in these private writing sessions, I like to envision a completion-based world. A wondrous utopia where we don’t feel the need to be better than the rest. It’s fun to think about, to think of writing about, but the butterflies that are my inspiration still disappear.
I find myself paralyzed by admiration and jealousy, stifled by a fear of not measuring up, and compelled by the impulse to do more. To find a prestigious internship, to do well in my classes, to let everyone know how smart and interesting I am, and to meet new people to compare myself to. I will probably be a better student by the end, but writing won’t be easy. It isn’t for anyone.
More often than not, I sit in front of my screen, desperately trying to pin down fleeting words. Sometimes I succeed and gather enough to write a piece like this one. Some days ideas flow fast enough, and there’s no time for my browser to wander to The Crimson webpage. Still, sometimes I think about my talented peers. I wonder if they must chase down their own butterflies. They probably do. Crimson block is like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a report nearly two years in the making recently revealed that “a permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” allowed former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez to continue harassing female students and colleagues for nearly 40 years, the University’s immediate response to this externally diagnosed fundamental problem of culture was not to stop these problems at their source, but rather to create a centralized system to report them.
Though itself not unhelpful, positioning this centralized reporting system as a solution to a campus culture that is permissive of sexual assault is misguided and misleading.
Surely, the 26-page report notes that the decentralized structure of Harvard allowed Domínguez to sexually harass at least 18 women over the course of several decades as he continued to rise through University ranks despite allegations against him. But it also notes several other factors that compromised these women’s safety: University officials failed to record harassment complaints; power dynamics and “cavernous faculty gender imbalances” silenced victims; and the Government Department members who knew of Domínguez’s actions made no effort to stop the misconduct. To us, the lack of a centralized reporting system is merely a scapegoat compared to these other, more deeply-rooted issues.
That being said, we do not think that working to create a centralized process to access personnel records and keep track of misconduct is in vain. This is a step in the right direction to holding powerful men at our institution accountable for their behavior. Yet this is reactive, not proactive. A centralized reporting system on its own does not stop harassment, nor does it guarantee that victims who come forward will be taken seriously.
The centralized reporting system is but a fail-safe to make it harder for those in power to turn a blind eye to repeated claims — but why do Harvard officials seem to be so prone to turning a blind eye in the first place?
The fact that numerous members of the Harvard community — including those in leadership positions — knew about Domínguez’s sexual misconduct long before the University officially took action speaks to a larger issue; the professor had been found guilty of harassment in 1983 after a junior faculty member accused him of misconduct, and nothing happened. Ultimately, there’s no guarantee that centralization could have prevented Domínguez’s rise — certainly not if that centralization awarded oversight power to the very same individuals who felt comfortable looking the other way.
In sum, the Harvard community appears to be plagued by a culture of apathy towards sexual assault that is only worsened when professors in high positions are able to leverage their accolades over their offenses. The administration tends to turn a blind eye to professors’ sexual misconduct until it becomes too big of a problem to ignore. How can we actively fight those trends, beyond simply bureaucratic reorganization?
If the University hopes to deal with our assault culture, it should start by believing its students, and advocating for them as soon as possible and not only when a scandal blows up — just like we should have done back in 1983, when several students penned a piece in The Crimson demanding a more thorough institutional response to Domínguez, to no avail.
The University could also work to gain our trust by sticking to its promise of accountability: Give us an update on Mathematics and Biology professor Martin A. Nowak, who has been on paid leave for almost a year after it was revealed he had extensive contact with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. No centralized reporting system can counteract a systemic culture in which these allegations are not seen as wholly disqualifying.
Structure is much easier to fix than culture, so naturally, it’s where the University starts. And, though a good, long-overdue start, it can’t be seen as the end. Structural change is only helpful insofar as it makes cultural change easier.
So yes, let’s create a centralized reporting system for instances of sexual harassment. But let that be the beginning of a broader conversation about how Harvard protects powerful men from facing consequences for their actions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People in this country get to where they get because they either work hard or they don’t; they sink or they swim, the wheat gets separated from the chaff, right? In New York, the nation’s largest city and my hometown, students are subjected to a sort of intellectual segregation from as young an age as four, replete with separate classrooms, teachers, and even entire schools for the city’s “gifted and talented.” At every academic level, students are packaged into schools and programs pre-fitted for their “cognitive ability,” culminating in the Standardized High School Admissions Test — a high-stakes entrance exam for eighth-graders pining for a spot in one of the city’s specialized high schools.
Stuyvesant High School, my alma mater, is the most selective of these schools with an acceptance rate lower than Harvard’s. Stuyvesant administers more Advanced Placement exams than any other high school in the world and in recent years about a quarter of its students go on to the Ivy League or other selective colleges. Elite universities, in the American imagination, represent the apotheosis of success in the meritocratic jeremiad of the American high school student. However, the journey to Harvard is just as much part of the Harvard experience as an undergraduate’s four years here.
To explore this aspect of the Harvard experience, I spoke with two of my high school’s valedictorians — the past three are all students at Harvard College — about their respective journeys and conceptions of merit.
While the two valedictorians were exceedingly humble, their stories of Stuyvesant betrayed the uglier side of an academic culture consumed by competition.
Matteo N. Wong ’22, a Crimson Magazine chair studying History & Literature, described his journey to Stuyvesant and Harvard beginning with his parents navigating the labyrinthine patchwork of Brooklyn’s public elementary and middle schools. Victoria Wong ’24 (no relation to Matteo), who plans to study Molecular and Cellular Biology, took advantage of her middle school’s free test-prep program as well as private test-prep the summer before the SHSAT. While it’s common for students to begin studying for the test starting earlier, their paths to Stuyvesant were decidedly less structured. In the end, both future valedictorians scored only a few points higher than the cutoff score.
Matteo told me the story of his freshman biology teacher competing with another teacher to “see who could give harder tests and lower scores.” This eventually meant students would be tested on material that had never been taught. Naturally, Matteo studied up on the textbook in advance to prepare — only to have his teacher announce that someone had “ruined the curve.”
Matteo and Victoria managed to succeed in this environment antithetical to learning not because of the intensity of the competition but in spite of it. Matteo’s thought process went as follows: “I was just like this is the game, these are the rules. I’m on the playing field, like I’m going to just do as best as I can.” In the end, this is what they said “meritocracy” boils down to. It’s not necessarily about being the smartest (although this might be some more humility), but about absorbing a set of rules and committing oneself to playing — no matter the personal sacrifice.
It was normal to see students having breakdowns in the hallways over a test grade or to come to class one day to find out one of your friends had been checked into a psychiatric institution or simply left the school entirely.
Matteo said he vividly remembers the school’s administration showing students a triangle with vertices marked: “Sleep, Social life, and Academics” and being told to choose two, as a pivotal moment in his academic career. Victoria also noted the “Stuyvesant triangle,” and as an upperclassman, she regularly received only two to three hours of sleep per night. Victoria remembers “crying with [her] mom” after receiving all her classes’ syllabi on the first day of school (I, on the other hand, cried in my bathtub).
Like Victoria and Matteo, I went to Stuyvesant because I was inspired to learn, only to be confronted by an institutional culture that was oftentimes indifferent to learning and insistent on competing for the sake of competition — a sort of academic Hunger Games in which the highest performing eighth-graders in the nation’s largest city compete to see who leaves with a ticket to an elite college, and which ones are left with permanently damaged self-esteem at a critical juncture in their development.
For all our talk of merit and egalitarianism, our schools betray the deeply hierarchical and unforgiving character of not only our educational infrastructure but our society at large. And while our economy self-corrects when it outpaces its limits, students suffer the consequences of schools that push them beyond their limits.
Victoria and Matteo represent the synthesis of our meritocratic machine, conveying its triumphs and pitfalls. While I don’t think I could name more industrious and motivated students, the travesty is not that our schools have valedictorians but that they have casualties: the emotional costs that young people will carry with themselves for the rest of their lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black doctoral students at the Harvard Graduate School of Education led a webinar on their research into racial injustices in the education and research fields Thursday.
The Harvard Graduate School of Education Solidarity Collective for Black Lives organized the panel in partnership with national advocacy group Black Lives Matter At School, the W.E.B. Du Bois Society, the Harvard Black Graduate Student Alliance, and Harvard’s Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs.
The virtual conversation was moderated by GSE Ph.D. student Zenzile S. Riddick and featured fellow doctoral students Nadirah F. Foley, Jeraul C. Mackey, Shandra M. Jones, and Julia R. Jeffries ’13.
Foley, whose research focuses on education inequality in suburban school environments, said suburban schools can often appear great by all performance measures, but Black and low-income students at those schools can often feel invisible in the classroom.
“Even in these ostensibly integrated ‘good’ suburban schools, Black students and lower income students, and particularly those who are at the intersection of these forms of marginalization, are having substantially separate and unequal experiences,” she said. “I think their stories deserve to be told.”
Jeffries, who studies the methods and roles of white teachers teaching about race-related topics in an urban environment, said she divided her research into two parts: an internal evaluation of privilege and proactive steps white educators can take toward providing students with an opportunity to learn more about the social context they live in.
“Unpacking their own whiteness and their own experience of whiteness and what it means to be a white person teaching particularly in an urban context is continuous work,” Jeffries said.
She said teachers should teach social studies in-depth but focus on projects that are “directly related to their current context and community” rather than broad strokes.
In a similar vein, Jones said her research focuses on how giving students an opportunity to develop and think about their racial identity affects educational outcomes.
“When I arrived at this work, I was thinking a lot about how race and ethnicity are so commonly associated with negative outcomes in education,” she said.
In many cases, though, a student coming to understand their racial identity can inspire academic success, Jones said.
“There are folks for whom when they think of that part of themselves, it’s exciting, it’s fuel, it’s part of the metal they put on to face the world, and that it actually fuels their further success,” she said.
Mackey, unlike the other three panelists, focused his research on social inequity in the job market and the changes necessary for fairer outcomes.
“For the majority of organizations in the U.S., they have at their founding racial inequality and exclusion,” he said.
To tackle this problem, Mackey noted that some policy changes are effective at reducing hiring bias, such as blinding resumes or removing degree requirements.
Still, policy is not the primary solution to the issue of workplace inequity, he said.
“It’s not simply creating better policy — that in some ways does create a more fair process and does attenuate some of this inequality — but being able to look at the cultural norms and assumptions that really permeate through our organizational structure,” Mackey said.
As the panelists discussed their research, they offered insight into some of the reasons why they chose to conduct it.
“There are things that my particular lens allows me to see and allows me to think: ‘Well, that might be an interesting area to explore,’” said Foley, who grew up attending a suburban school.
Jeffries also connected her efforts to her past experience in school, noting that she “never felt necessarily affirmed” in her racial identity in school.
Mackey said he took on the research into job market inequality because he felt he could make an impact.
“It’s not about ‘how do you create a nice paper that’s going to be read by other scholars,’ but really ‘how do you do research that has an impact and really can change the culture of organizations,’” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College student athletes reacted with surprise, gratitude, and skepticism to the Ivy League’s decision Thursday to allow current senior student athletes to compete as graduate students next year, in a reversal of a longstanding League policy barring graduate students from competition.
Harvard College senior student athletes will be allowed to compete for Harvard as graduate students during the 2021-2022 academic year, Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott announced in an email to senior athletes Thursday.
The Ivy League presidents granted a temporary waiver to Ivy League senior student athletes whose sports seasons were canceled due to the pandemic, per a League statement McDermott provided in the email.
Following the NCAA’s announcement that athletes whose seasons were canceled due to Covid-19 would preserve an extra year of eligibility, the Ivy League released its own statement in April stating it would continue its policy barring graduate students from athletics. As a result, Harvard athletes who wanted to use their eligibility would have to do so at a university outside of the League.
On Thursday, though, the League acknowledged senior student athletes’ unique situations by issuing the waiver. The waiver only applies to Ivy League students graduating this spring.
Student Athlete Advisory Committee Co-President Matthew R. Thomas ’21 said he welcomed the news Thursday afternoon. Thomas said the League’s policy change was the upshot of student-athlete advocacy across the Ivy League.
“This was actually almost entirely Ivy League SAAC-driven,” he said. “We actually wrote a letter that we sent to the Ivy League administration saying, ‘Hey, can you please consider allowing graduate students to play?’”
Thomas, a member of Harvard’s baseball team, said he is excited about the opportunity to continue his Harvard athletics career. For the 2021-2022 academic year, he will attend the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“I’m in a unique position where it is a possibility,” he said. “I’ll be a Harvard graduate student where this is actually something that I might be able to look at and see if I want to do.”
Still, Harvard football player Eric J. Wilson ’21 said he believes the Ivy League’s decision is “great,” but “too little, too late.”
“Either people have already taken a semester off or are currently taking a semester off, or have already made their plans set for next year about what they’re doing, like myself,” Wilson said. “It’s not even on the table as an option for anyone that I know.”
Wilson — who will compete for Pennsylvania State University after graduating this year — is among some of the Harvard seniors who have opted to use their remaining eligibility at a non-League institution as a graduate student. Had the League approved the waiver earlier, he said, remaining on the Harvard team while pursuing graduate studies in Cambridge may have been an option.
“The announcement at this time is pretty tough,” Wilson said. “That means prepping for a GMAT or GRE in this short time period and pretty much having to figure out how you’re going to ace it in about a few weeks.”
Some rising senior student athletes currently on leave from the College said they are also skeptical about the Ivy League’s decision.
Men’s lacrosse player Charles E. Olmert ’21-’22 said he already made plans under the assumption that he could not play for Harvard’s lacrosse team after graduating from the College. Olmert said he wished the League would have made its decision sooner — not 11 months after his lacrosse season was canceled.
“It may have changed my decision if I’d known this back in August and just may have changed some of the things I was thinking about my future whether that may have been applying to law school for right after my senior year,” Olmert said. “Having thought back in August that I couldn’t play as a grad, I was 100 percent committed to taking a leave of absence.”
Harvard squash player Samuel B. Scherl ’21-’22 said the waiver is a “nice gesture” from the Ivy League, but one he said comes “a little too late” for many enrolled seniors.
Scherl, who is taking a gap year, said he would have declared his leave even if the waiver for seniors had been offered before last fall.
“It wouldn’t have affected my enrollment plans,” he said. “It’s pretty hard to make an enrollment decision hoping that you’ll get into Harvard grad school.”
Amelia F. “Mimi” Tarrant ’21, who plays on the field hockey team and took a leave of absence last fall to preserve her eligibility, also said the League’s decision was “too little, too late.”
“I think that this could have been effective if they had announced this decision to allow grad students to play back in, let’s say, September, whilst people were deciding about whether to take a leave or not — so for example, with me,” she said. “This now doesn’t really apply to me because I’ve already taken my leave from Harvard.”
Tarrant also said she believes the Ivy League’s regular policy barring graduate students from competition puts it at a disadvantage.
“I do feel quite strongly that the Ivy League does compromise itself quite significantly by not allowing grad students to play,” she said. “This just seems like another bureaucratic thing that hinders the quality of sport played within the Ivy League.”
Ivy League spokesperson Matthew J. Panto did not respond to a request for comment.

The Undergraduate Council voted on Sunday to restore its summer storage program and to petition for the removal of the Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services’ recent $25 fee for last-minute cancellations and missed appointments.
The first piece of legislation renewed its summer storage program with Five Star Movers for the 2021 year to financially assist up to 400 College students, allocating $32,000 in funding. Five thousand dollars will come from the UC’s own funds and the remaining $27,000 will come from remaining storage funds, faculty deans, and students benefiting from the program.
In 2019, the UC’s summer storage program accommodated up to 500 College students. In 2020, the College partnered with Olympia Moving and Storage to assist students with their rapid move-outs in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Storage can be a huge financial burden and source of stress to many students,” the policy states. “The UC is committed to improving financial accessibility on campus for students who are from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds.”
Student applicants will be chosen based on their SEF eligibility, distance from the campus, and percentage of financial aid.
The program will allow students to store their belongings until the start of fall 2021 at a price of $10 per box, according to the legislation.
Social & Residential Life Chair David Y. Zhang ’23, Crimson Yard Representative Lisa R. Mathew ’24, Leverett House Representative John E. “Jake” Leary III '22 and First Year Committee Chair Esther J. Xiang ’23 were the primary sponsors for the program.
The UC will release a survey soon for students to sign up for the program and inform the UC of how much demand there is for storage aid.
The second piece of legislation — sponsored by Xiang, Shreya P. Nair ’24, Brooke L. Livingston ’23, Craig W. Mcfarland, Jr. ’24, and Anant P. Rajan ’24 — releases a statement and petition to remove the CAMHS late cancellation and no show fee.
Reinstituted on Jan. 1, the legislation claims the fee may disproportionately burden first-generation, low-income students and disincentivize those in need of professional mental health support.
“A missed appointment may be a symptom of an underlying issue which a student has no control over,” it reads. “Additionally, the start of the Spring semester has exacerbated problems of academic stress and mental health. For these reasons, a punitive measure is counterintuitive.”
The legislation was passed unanimously by a motion of unanimous consent.

The Harvard Law Review elected second year law student Hassaan Shahawy ’16 as the journal’s president earlier this month, making him the first Muslim to hold the role in its 135-year history.
Born into an Egyptian Muslim family, Shahawy, a Los Angeles native, graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. in History and Near Eastern Studies. After college, he pursued a doctorate in Oriental Studies at the University of Oxford through the Rhodes Scholarship and later returned to Cambridge as a student of the Law School.
Shahawy was with his wife, Iman A. Masmoudi ’18, and family when he received the news, and spent the rest of the evening mulling how he could “use the position to do some good,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
Shahawy, who was a general editor for the publication before running for president this past January, wrote that he has “never aspired to be the ‘first Muslim’ to do anything.”
“I’ve always tried to focus on the substance of my life and work: am I living consistently with my faith and my values, and am I helping people as much as I can,” he wrote.
At the same time, Shahawy wrote that he plans to use his background to diversify the viewpoints presented in the journal.
“I’m focused more on how I might actually bring my Muslim faith and my academic background in Islamic law, to my work, hopefully to add new perspective and enrich ongoing conversations.”
Shahawy also wrote that he hopes his presidency will mitigate harmful stereotypes about Muslims in American society.
“My wife told me about some funny Tweets warning that my election marks the coming of the ‘Harvard Sharia Review,’” he wrote. “I hoped that there really is some good coming just from the event, even if small and symbolic, by pushing back against such discourse and destigmatizing the role of Muslims in American public discourse.”
Shahawy’s predecessor, Michaeljit S. Sandhu, lauded the new president in an interview with Harvard Law Today.
“Hassaan is astoundingly smart and unceasingly modest,” Sandhu said. “His collaborative approach to leadership, deep commitment to engagement across difference, and excellent judgement will serve the Review extremely well during this extraordinary time.”
Shahawy wrote he is excited and humbled to helm the Law Review this upcoming year.
“We in Volume 135 are incredibly lucky to be inheriting this beautiful community and institution left for us by Volume 134,” Shahawy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matilda Marcus ’24 was almost at a loss when describing Datamatch to her friends.
“It’s kind of like Tinder, but only your college, and there’s a survey,” she said.
They didn’t really understand.
Datamatch — a free matchmaking service run by Harvard students — boasted sign ups from more than half of Harvard’s undergraduate population this year.
After filling out a survey and profile, participants can be matched with other students to meet up in person or go on a virtual Zoom date. The program partnered with restaurants near certain college campuses — like Playa Bowls and Black Sheep Bagel Cafe in Harvard Square — to offer students free food on their dates.
This year, Datamatch reached 33 different college campuses and spread the love to more than 42,000 students across the country.
Otherwise known as “Supreme Cupids,” Datamach Campus Leads Bill W. Zhang ’21 and Isabelle S. Zheng ’22 said the Covid-19 pandemic created a new set of considerations for connecting people off-campus.
“We didn’t want the students off campus to feel like they're left out or abandoned, because we know that’s something they felt all too often during this year,” Zhang said.
“We really focused on building out that user experience, finding partnerships like Snackpass to offer dates at more locations, finding other alternative date methods that are virtual, and in general just keeping the Datamatch experience as inclusive and open as possible,” he added.
Instead of focusing on on-campus marketing strategies such as distributing flyers, Business Lead Katherine Y. Zhu ’23 said the team relied more heavily on online marketing than they have in previous years.
“We really had to just completely rethink a lot of our strategies,” Zhu said. “We still did some of the flyering, but a lot of it now was like, we’re trying to go viral on TikTok, we’re starting a Twitter account, we are following everyone on Instagram just to let people know that Datamatch is happening.”
Datamatch was founded by Harvard students in 1994, and has since expanded nationwide. Because of the online platform, Zheng said, members from other schools have been able to become more involved on Datamatch’s various teams.
“I think we’ve been able to have a lot more rapport just because this is the only way we are communicating with each other, and it feels more like equal grounds in that sense,” Zheng said.
Mario A. Habashy ’23 participated in Datamatch this year and said it was a “fun experience.”
“I’m not quite sure how the algorithm works, because the questions seem so random,” he said. “But it’s in good spirit. It’s fun to do.”
Kim-Anh Nguyen ’21, who is one of the leads on the Datamatch Algorithm Team, called the match algorithm a “secret sauce.”
“One of the main themes of Datamatch is that the algorithm is top secret — the secret sauce,” Nguyen said. “As for who you might be matched with, the criteria changes every year. We try to make it better and more accurate.”
“Of course, it’s very difficult to model attraction,” she added.
New features this year included “Crush Roulette,” which allowed users to submit two email addresses to increase the chance that those two users would get matched, and the “Block List,” which let users submit the email addresses of students they would prefer to not match with.
“The goal was for people to be able to anonymously shoot their shot, yet have that plausible deniability where if they in fact did get matched with someone, they would not know for sure whether that person had indicated interest in them too,” Design Lead Melissa W. Kwan ’22 said.
“So we wanted to add a little bit of excitement there while also allowing people to have a bit of say in the algorithm’s performance,” she added.
The team previously launched Quarantine Datamatch on May 25, 2020, as a way for students to connect remotely during the pandemic, and Meet 24 on Sept. 28, 2020 with the goal of connecting freshmen in the class of 2024.
Marcus, a freshman from the U.K., said she met her current girlfriend during Quarantine Datamatch.
“We didn’t match, but we used the search function and searched each other up in secret. And then we both got alerted,” she said. “Then we’ve kind of like, just been dating ever since.”
Marcus, who has not been able to live on campus her first year due to international Covid-19 restrictions, had also participated in Meet24 in the past to find friends.
“I have participated in the platonic function,” she said. “It is so, so difficult to make friends, especially last semester when all of the first years were there.”
Habashy said he didn’t finish taking the Datamatch survey last year, but made sure to fill it out this spring.
“I didn’t take it seriously last year, because I had so many options to meet people,” he said. “There’s so little connection between me and Harvard itself, that having the opportunity to meet someone from Harvard — I took it a little bit more seriously than last year.”
Nicolas A. Vallenas ’23, who also participated in Datamatch this year, said he signed up as a freshman but never met with anyone that year.
“I feel like they’ve improved the model a lot from the first time that I tried it out,” Vallenas said. “I should also say that the survey questions were absolutely hilarious. I just had fun just filling them out.”
Vallenas said he has plans to meet a match in person in Boston this year.
Web Lead Anurag Mitra ’23 said a big reason he joined Datamatch to help students foster connections.
“I love the Datamatch community, and I feel pretty warm when I realize that I’m helping other people meet new people, especially during the time of quarantine, and that's something which attracted me right in the beginning,” Mitra said.
Zheng, one of the Supreme Cupids, said that while the successful love stories resulting from Datamatch are a “great side effect” of the program, it is not the team’s goal.
“It’s just like the cherry on top for us to see a really successful love story come out,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Seema Kakade assumed her role as the director of the University of Maryland’s environmental law clinic, Wendy B. Jacobs welcomed her with open arms.
“She specifically sought me out, welcomed me to the community of clinic directors, told me it was the best job in the world, told me it was an extremely hard job, and really challenging to battle priorities,” Kakade said. “I just really appreciated that, the welcoming of somebody new into a community exemplifies who she was.”
Jacobs, a professor at Harvard Law School and the founder and director of the Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, died on Feb. 1 after battling an illness. She was 64.
In her research work, Jacobs focused on a wide variety of professional projects, including legal and policy-oriented initiatives, drafting legislation, regulations and ordinances, and pursuing administrative trials and appeals.
“She didn’t want to do routine projects,” said Shaun A. Goho, deputy director of the Emmett Clinic. “She always felt like if you were going to be doing something, do it because it’s going to make a difference. You don't do it just for the sake of doing it.”
Goho added that Jacobs was “a remarkable package” as an educator, who rigorously pushed her students and supported them in every way possible, often well beyond their HLS career.
“Students have talked about how she invited the student and the student’s family to have dinner with her and her family,” he said. “Or they’d go for a picnic together in the summer, and she would have very frank conversations with them about challenges of getting ahead in your career as a lawyer.”
To Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus, Jacobs’ kindness and drive for environmental justice defined her character.
“Professor Jacobs wonderfully combined personal kindness, unqualified pride in her students, and fierce lawyering on behalf of protecting the environment and promoting environmental justice,” Lazarus wrote in an email.
Jacobs also created and taught the Law School’s Climate Solutions Living Lab course, where students from across the University’s graduate schools collaborated to devise solutions to make institutions more environmentally sustainable.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 said in an interview with Harvard Law Today that Jacobs worked tirelessly to actualize the positive influence of the law, particularly in the realm of environmentalism.
“Wendy had a deep faith in, and worked hard to realize, the positive role law can play in protecting the environment, addressing climate change, and preserving the earth for generations to come,” Manning said.
Jacobs’ influence extended far beyond Harvard Law School, particularly in her dedication to maintaining and strengthening the partnerships between different environmental law clinics.
“I could just see in the room, how many people in the clinic director community really looked to her as a role model,” Kakade added. “What she had built in the Harvard Environmental Law Clinic I think was really exemplary.”
Mindy Goldstein, a professor at Emory Law School and the director of its environmental law clinic, described Jacobs as being incredibly “generous” with the knowledge she had amassed while directing the Law School’s environmental clinic.
Above all, Goldstein said Jacobs was a trusted friend who was always willing to spend time with her colleagues, even outside of their clinical work.
“She was a good person, and she was willing to share her time, her thoughts, her insights,” Goldstein said. “She was also willing to laugh with you, to joke around, to just talk, to just kind of pick up the phone and have a good talk.”
“Her friendship is what made her such a remarkable colleague and friend,” she added.
A website commemorating the life of Jacobs featured the messages of people who knew her, including students, faculty, and clinic colleagues.
“Although there were — and continue to be — so many negative news stories when it comes to our environment, Wendy’s environmental law clinic was also a bright, hopeful place because of her commitment to the work and her care for all of her students,” John D. Cella ’08, a former clinic student, wrote on the website.
Byron H. Ruby, a former student of Jacobs, wrote on the website that meeting her in the elevator during his first week of law school was “a bit of a celebrity moment.”
When Ruby asked whether it was possible to allow a first year law student to enroll in one of her filled classes about renewables, he wrote Jacobs surprised him by reciprocating the same sort of enthusiasm.
“Her eyes lit up immediately when I mentioned the class and her clinic,” Ruby wrote. “It didn’t matter that it was overbooked, she said, she would find a way. And it didn’t matter that it wasn’t really for 1Ls, she said, she would find a way. And when I called her Professor Jacobs, she said, ‘just call me Wendy.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard History of Science professor Evelynn M. Hammonds and University of Colorado Boulder law professor Craig Konnoth discussed ways to confront racism in medicine and disparities in the delivery of health care during a virtual panel Friday.
The conversation — moderated by Michelle Morse, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School — was part of the Health Policy and Bioethics Consortia, a monthly series organized by the Medical School and the Law School that brings together experts from separate disciplines to discuss issues relating to biomedical innovation and healthcare delivery.
Konnoth and Hammonds spoke about the historical development of medical stereotypes that impact the health outcomes of Black individuals today.
Konnoth cited a belief held during the era of slavery in the United States that Black individuals are inferior to their white counterparts — a medical myth he argued continues to harm Black people today.
He connected this myth to current misconceptions that Black individuals have higher pain tolerance and greater resistance to certain contagions compared to white individuals. In an interview, Konnoth said that while advances in medicine — especially during the pandemic — should be lauded, its historical harm to Black people should be acknowledged.
“While medicine is seen as something that is important, especially during these times of Covid for people to live good lives, it’s important to understand the injustice that had been created in the past to ensure that there is equity moving forward,” he said.
Hammonds also said the socially-constructed idea that Black people are anatomically and psychologically different was widely utilized by white physicians in the 19th century to differentiate Black individuals from their white counterparts. She described how this racist ideology became “sedimented in medical theory and practice,” leaving harmful remnants within current healthcare systems.
Konnoth and Hammonds also put forth ways to combat racism in medicine. To that end, Konnoth noted the importance of integrating medicine and law.
“We want to use medicine to leverage legal solutions,” he said during the panel.
Konnoth also said that health professionals should aim to “transform” the perspective of race within medicine instead of completely eliminating the topic from conversation.
“I think that one thing that can be done is to try and shift the pathology from race to racism,” Konnoth said.
Hammonds said during the event that it is important to investigate “where the harm occurs, how the harm is manifest.”
She said medical experts should interrogate widely used practices and deeply held beliefs about differences among races.
To combat racism in medicine, Morse said Harvard should listen to and engage with members of marginalized groups outside of the ivory tower.
“I think what we need to be doing more of is, you know, not just having discussions within our institutions, but really following the lead of the most marginalized communities and community organizers in those communities,” Morse said in an interview.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reparations for descendants of enslaved individuals in the U.S. could have reduced Covid-19 transmission among Black Americans, according to a peer-reviewed study published online last Tuesday by Harvard Medical School researchers.
The study is part of a larger report by the Lancet Commission on Reparations and Redistributive Justice — a group of experts that is investigating several claims for reparations worldwide — that will most likely be published in the summer of 2021, according to Medical School professor Eugene T. Richardson, who chairs the Commission.
Richardson, who is also the corresponding author of the study published Tuesday, said the commission is examining reparations claims involving South Africa’s apartheid system, Native American genocide, descendants of people enslaved in the U.S., India’s caste system, Caribbean slavery and genocide, female victims of armed conflict, and climate justice among others, in order to produce recommendations.
Richardson said the study on reparations for slavery is the first to be published based on research done for the report.
This study, according to Richardson, aims to develop an infectious disease model that incorporates considerations for racial health disparities.
“Almost all of the Covid models you’ll look at have to do with wearing masks, social distancing, closing down businesses — that kind of thing,” he said. “Yet, there are these huge health disparities — notably between people of color and white people, especially in the U.S. — and you rarely see racial justice interventions being incorporated into these models.”
Bram P. Wispelwey — a hospitalist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital who was not involved in the study — said this is the first study to use modeling to show that “reparations can have a health impact directly.”
The study found that, if African American descendants of enslaved Black persons had received financial reparations prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Covid-19 transmission in Louisiana would have decreased by 31 to 68 percent.
HMS assistant professor Michelle E. Morse, one of the study’s authors, said reparations “could have been as effective as a vaccine.”
She said the failure of the U.S. to implement this compensation highlights the long-standing injustices within the country.
“I think the fact that the U.S. has skirted its responsibility and avoided reach for reconciliation in a meaningful way for hundreds of years is why we keep seeing the same pattern of racial injustice play out over and over and over again in this country,” Morse added.
The study suggests a foundation for future key implementations in the realm of racial and social justice and public health.
“This study shows the modeling and now what we need to do is start to do it in practice, and then to analyze it right and scale it up,” Wispelwey said.
Morse highlighted the significance of bringing in researchers from interdisciplinary fields and diverse perspectives, as is being done in the Lancet Commission report that contains this study.
“One of the ways that we improve in medicine is by bringing in more social science, instead of only focusing on the biomedical model,” Morse said. “In the health community and the health professions, we need to continue to seek out collaborations with the social science disciplines.”

We all know that the Harvard Alumni Network is vast, but who would have thought that it includes Julia Quinn — aka Julie Cotler Pottinger ’92; aka the author of the novels that brought us the Bridgerton series (and, sigh, Simon Basset). The original tell-all Lady Whistledown agreed to be interviewed for Flyby, spilling her Harvard hot-takes, Bridgerton Season 2 anticipations, and much-needed relationship advice.
AAK: What dorm did you live in?
JCP: Pennypacker and Mather.
AAK: What did you think of Mather?
JCP: [silence] I was not looked upon well by the housing lottery gods, let’s just put it that way. It wasn’t a random lottery when I was there. It was a transition year. It went completely random the year after us. The year before us, it was this thing where you wouldn’t necessarily get what you wanted, but you would put your top three and you knew what your lottery number was. My year was a transition year where they didn’t tell you what your lottery number was — you had to try to, like, game the system. Yeah, we were this total transition year. And, yeah, we ended up in Mather. But my boyfriend was in Dunster so I guess that helped — and I married him!
Good to know that the Class of 1992’s Housing Day was just as wacky as ours will be.
AAK: What was your favorite class at Harvard?
JCP: Evolutionary Biology with E. O. Wilson.
I can’t say I knew who E.O. Wilson is, but my editor quickly let me know that the man is a legend.
AAK: What activities were you involved in on campus?
JCP: I was a Peer Contraceptive Counselor — do you still have that? We would go into freshman dorms and teach about how to use contraception, and we would also man a hotline! I worked for CityStep; I wasn’t a dancer, but I worked behind the scenes. I also worked for the Let’s Go Travel Guides. It was through Harvard Student Agencies (HSA), and they produced Let’s Go Europe and other travel guides. One summer I went to Crete and Cyprus, and then the next summer I worked in the HSA office selling the advertising for the books!
AAK: What was your favorite study spot?
JCP: I guess Lamont Library because I worked at the circulation desk, and interestingly enough, some of the closest friends I am still in touch with are the people that I worked with at Lamont, not necessarily the people I lived with! There was nothing super special [about Lamont]. I was actually looking at it — my son’s a junior in high school — so we were going through Harvard’s digital tours. We went into Lamont, and I was like, “There’s a cafe in there now?! What?” [laughs] We did not have that, but I really enjoyed working there. We had a lot of fun; sometimes we’d bring in a board game and play it at the desk while we were checking out books. And the people who were studying, every now and then one of them would wander out, and be like, “Sooo, who’s got Kamchatka right now?” A bunch of Harvard geeks, you know — they can’t resist playing Risk.
AAK: What were your favorite restaurants in the Square? 
JCP: I was at Harvard Square recently, and it’s a very different food scene now, but The Border Cafe I still love. Definitely love the Border Cafe. The Hong Kong! We would order the potstickers for take out.
Looks like we’re not the only one’s mourning the loss of Border Cafe...
AAK: Did anything from your time as an undergrad at Harvard inspire parts of your Regency novels? 
JCP: Not in terms of content, but I would read Regency Historical romances for fun, and that would be what I would read when I wanted to relax. But they were hard to find! I would have to go all the way to the Waldenbooks at Kendall Square because the COOP and the Harvard Book Store didn’t sell them — that was kind of a pain. When I was back on campus for my 25th Reunion, they had a big display of all of the authors in the COOP, and so they had mine in there, and I took a picture like, “Hey, Mom, I’m finally in the COOP!”
AAK: If Lady Whistledown had come to Harvard when you were a student… what salacious secrets would she spill?
JCP: Ooh. [silence] [prolonged silence] I can’t tell you any of that stuff! That’s a good question though.
Ok, we’re definitely *not* curious about what went down during Quinn’s time at Harvard now.
AAK: You definitely get asked this a lot, but what inspired you to start writing Regency novels?
JCP: It was what I liked to read. It’s as simple as that. I mean, any time you ask a writer why they became a writer, it’s because they like to read. And so, more specifically for me, it was what I liked to read for fun!
AAK: Were you surprised by Shonda Rimes’ interest in adapting your books for Netflix? 
JCP: I was totally surprised! No one was doing anything like that, because if Hollywood wanted to do a period piece, they would do yet another Jane Austen prestige piece — which is great because I love all of the Jane Austen adaptations. But I don’t think it’s a surprise that Shonda Rimes would be the person who would have enough vision to give my books, to be like, “Wait a minute, we have all this incredible source material and all these people who already love it, let’s give this a try!”
AAK: Were you surprised by the response to the show? As you know, Netflix recently declared it the most popular debut in its history. 
JCP: I was pretty certain a lot of people would like it. I didn’t think it was going to be a flop. I knew that there was a huge contingent of people who liked romance novels who were incredibly excited for it, because we hardly ever get anything like it. I did not think it was going to take off like it did! That took me by surprise, and it certainly took my publishing house by surprise. The books are sold out everywhere. We can’t keep them in stores!
AAK: What was it like being on set?
JCP: I get asked this a lot, and it’s as crazy as you’d think to see the characters come to life. But the part that actually surprised me the most was the scope of it. All of a sudden you realize that there are hundreds and hundreds of people working on this project that started out as just one person just in your head, and you think, “How did this happen?” When I met Adjoa Andoh, who plays Lady Danbury, she said to me, “Thank you for keeping me employed!” I told her I wasn’t sure I was the one she should thank, but you’re welcome I guess! There are so many people working there, and on top of it, they’ve formed a tight knit family because they’ve been working together day in day out for months. What’s a little odd is that I’m not really part of that family anymore. I’m sort of like the Fairy Godmother off in Seattle, eight or nine thousand miles away, so that’s a little odd.
AAK: Do you have a favorite character?
JCP: I wouldn’t say that, but the character I’d like to be when I grow up is Lady Danbury. In the books, she’s even, like more. Just more. [laughs]
Don’t we all want to be Lady Danbury?
AAK: Is there anything in particular from your books that you’re especially excited to see on screen in the next season?
JCP: I haven’t seen the scripts for season two, and I can’t guarantee what’s in them. What I hope shows up is the pall mall game, which is like a croquet game. I kind of joke that the Bridgertons make it a blood sport, since they get very competitive with it! I’m really, really hopeful that’s in season two.
AAK: On a more serious note, everyone was very intrigued by how the adaptation explores several issues that are relevant today. How do you feel about how the issues of race and race in history and literature are explored and presented in the show?
JCP: In the books that I wrote 20 years ago, I don’t think I even described the color of peoples’ skin, but it’s certainly implied they are all white. I can’t take credit for the casting. I had nothing to do with it, but I 100 percent, unequivocally, love it. I am incredibly grateful to the creative team for figuring out a great way to do this. I love that they started with a historical nugget, which was that many people believe that Queen Charlotte was of mixed race, and said, ‘Ok, what if this was accepted at the time and what if Queen Charlotte used this position to elevate other people of color to the aristocracy? What would society look like then?’ So they created this slightly alternate universe. The way I look at it is that you can have something which is totally accurate, or you could have something where more people can see themselves in a wonderful, fun story with a happy ending, and I’m going to choose the latter every time. Bridgerton is not a history lesson, it’s a show for modern audiences. The main point of romance novels is the happy ending, and the feelings people get when they read them. I want as many people as possible to get that happy feeling when watching the show.
AAK: Valentine’s Day has come and gone, so I’m wondering what was your best Valentine’s day on campus?
JCP: I did not have a bad Valentine’s Day on campus, I have to confess. I met the guy I married on the 3rd day of freshman week. My friends and I were eating at what was then called the Freshman Union; he was a junior, but he was back early because he was a FOP leader. He wasn’t my FOP leader, but his roommate was. My husband lived in Dunster House, but because it was freshman week and the Dunster dining hall wasn’t open yet, he was eating at the Freshman Union with his roommate, who saw me and they came over and ate with us. And that’s how I met him! So I had four great Valentine’s Days at Harvard.
A story as romantic as matching on Datamatch.
AAK: As a renowned historical romance novelist, do you have any timeless advice for love and romance?
JCP: I don’t know whether this will work for college students, but the smoothest thing my husband ever did for me on Valentine’s day was, when I was visiting family in Denver and he was back in New Haven in medical school, he called up my sister to get the number of a florist so he could send me flowers. And when the flowers came, he sent flowers to me, my sister, my mother and my grandmother. That is something I actually put in The Duke and I. When Simon first brings flowers to Daphne, he also brings some to Violet, her mother. You don’t actually see this moment in the show, but Daphne briefly mentions it, which is actually something I pointedly asked them to put in there! So that would be my tip to people! If you are away from your Valentine, send them, their mother, their sister and their grandmother flowers! You’ll be in forever.
