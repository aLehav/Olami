"A bus ticket from Tallinn to Tartu costs twenty Estonian kroons,” begins Tõnu Õnnepalu’s "Radio." For a novel’s opening line, the statement is not electrifying. It is a factual observation, devoid of any imagery or unique phrasing to distinguish itself. Yet the simplicity is revolutionary, the statement too full of nuances to ignore. The sentence ends up serving as a perfect introduction to “Radio” and an apt representation of its nature. Tõnu Õnnepalu’s latest novel is almost paradoxical: tiresome but intelligent, dull but thought-provoking, repetitive but unusual.
“Radio” begins with the narrator’s return to Estonia. After a decade in Paris, he regards his homeland with slight disdain, as he describes an unappealing bus ride with a drunken passenger and a gray landscape. But Õnnepalu does not focus on the stereotypical conflict between two places, and as the novel progresses, he weaves a memoir of the narrator’s love affair with an older singer, Liz Franz, and the narrator’s past and current experiences with other characters. As the novel progresses, Õnnepalu adds narrative digressions, deliberations, and an internal conflict—between the narrator’s homosexuality and heterosexual relations with Liz Franz, between his cultural understanding of Paris and Estonia—to weave a complicated tale.
Through its set-up, the novel shines in wisdom and intelligence. The narrator provides background on Estonia’s history and serves as the vessel for  Õnnepalu’s criticism of Estonian society and government. The novel is full of descriptions of the Soviet government’s implementations and their painfully laughable results; all the while, images of Paris feel hollow and similarly ludicrous. The philosophical depth  Õnnepalu achieves is astounding, reminiscent of the thought found in great literary classics and refreshing when compared to most novels published today. His unusual stylistic choices strengthens this impression: oftentimes, he adds the French translation of a word inside parentheses as a way of showing France’s influence on the narrator. Certain words are bolded, certain statements italicized. Terse statements like “Appearance is a great theater. And a question of will,” carry a philosophical weight that adds to the novel’s meditative character. Onnepalu’s ability to weave complexity into simple sentences is worthy of praise.
Yet it is this deft style that ultimately destroys the novel’s appeal. While the commentary is initially illuminating, after several chapters, it becomes excessive. The result is a story too focused on ideas to contain much plot, too caught up in proving a point to develop characters. The narrator serves as the centerpiece for the novel, but, instead of giving readers perspective towards the events and other characters, he becomes the sole object of interest. This is problematic because the narrator, described as “oversensitive and narcissistic” in the book’s blurb, cannot elicit any sympathy. The novel requires an engaging plot and secondary characters to give it power, something it fails to provide.
What little readers know of other characters is based on descriptions alone; dialogue is sparse, and instead  Õnnepalu demands readers to believe the narrator’s opinions. The move has potential, but the narrator is too self-centered and instead reduces the other characters to flat forms. When the narrator talks about Asko, his attractive and young neighbor, he forces Asko into the role of failed sexual interest and a representation of the two’s generation gap. “Asko is an ordinary boy,” the narrator asserts; any personality quirks are irrelevant. The characters become subject to the narrator’s fantasies or biases, until it is impossible to understand the other characters as individuals. Without appealing characters, the novel loses a point of connection with the reader.
The only interesting character besides the narrator is Liz Franz. Her origin, rise to success, and many relationships make for an intriguing story, and her unique traits, such as her interest in tarot cards, paint her as a dynamic individual. Yet her story, despite being the one that finalizes the narrator’s thematic epiphany, becomes lost in the social commentary and narrative digressions. The narrator mentions her in every chapter, but her story blurs into his historical commentary and egotistical ramblings until it is distinguishable and forgettable. It is only near the last third of the novel that the reader discovers how the narrator met her and understands their complex relationship. By then, reader interest is gone, and Liz Franz, like everyone else in the novel, has lost her allure.
General disinterest towards the plot and characters reigns as the novel plods forwards too sluggishly, too focused on interspersing meaningful remarks among the story’s lines. As the pages stretch on, even the once unique testimonies become a bore and grow into something less revolutionary than problematic. “Radio” is a tour-de-force in concepts and a brilliant example of the intersection between language and meaning; without an engaging story or characters, however, the novel loses it spark and ends up feeling like a track played on air for far too long.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actors Maggie Q and Mekhi Phifer are really excited for you to see their new film “Divergent.” “Wasn’t it fun?” asks Q, equally effervescent and demanding. “I really had an experience and I gave a shit about everyone in this. I wanted to see the second one yesterday.” Phifer couldn’t agree more: “It’s a fun ride.”
The pair play minor but significant supporting roles in the upcoming adaptation of Veronica Roth’s novel “Divergent,” which takes place in a crumbling, futuristic Chicago. The city’s inhabitants, who are divided into five factions that represent choice human virtues, are separated from the rest of the world for unknown reasons. 16-year-old Tris Prior, played by Shailene Woodley, trades in selflessness for bravery when she leaves her birth faction Abnegation for Dauntless.
It is here that Q and Phifer step in. As tattoo artist Tori, Q plays an unwilling mentor to Woodley’s character once she joins the Dauntless faction. In some ways, Q is used to this role: she spent four seasons starring in the television show “Nikita,” where a central aspect of her character involved training a younger colleague. Yet “Divergent” offered a new set of challenges for a familiar role. “I played a mentor on my show, but I was the mentor that was willing and able and eager, and my student was a little resistant to it. [‘Divergent’] is the opposite. I’m the unwilling mentor, and she’s after me trying to get information.”
This unexpected complexity attracted both Q and Phifer to the movie. “[Tori] is like, ‘I just do tattoos, like get out of my face! I don’t want to be in your world because I know that world and it’s not okay,’” Q says. Tori’s dark back-story is hinted at in the film, but much of her complexity remains to be seen. “We looked at the roles as a base to build from to the next and the next film. And that’s what made it interesting for me.”
Phifer agrees. “I’m looking forward to see what [film] two brings to the table,” he says. “This is [my and Maggie’s] first time doing a film that involves sequels. It’s interesting to see the character arc and where it’s going to go.”
Phifer plays Max, the leader of the Dauntless faction. “I like that Max is a leader,” Phifer says. “But what I like most about it is that there’s an unknown. There’s an X factor. I have to see where they go, where they take him. And that’s what I like, exploring the unknown with who Max is and who he’s going to be.”
Such is the benefit of sequels: “Divergent” is the first of a trilogy. It was released March 21, with the next two planned for release at one-year intervals. “There’s a history for all these characters that we’re going to explore soon, which is really nice,” Q says. “I really get to mess Kate [Winslet, the villain] up in the next one. We’re going to have a little more physicality, so that will be fun.”
In Hollywood, though, nothing is guaranteed. “Depending on how the film works out, some things they may pump up, some things they may pipe down. Depending on if we suck, they’re going to cut us out, give us no dialogue,” she jokes. “Oh no, Tori dies early. A mysterious virus!”
Yet Phifer and Q are confident that “Divergent” has delivered a thrilling adaptation that stays true to the book’s spirit.  “There’s a certain amount of artistic license that you’re giving when you do adaptations,” Phifer says. “Obviously we can’t quote the book word for word. We have to sort of tweak it a little bit. I think people will be pleasantly surprised and pleased from the book to the film adaptation, what our creative forces put together.”
“A good indication too is that Veronica [Roth] was really happy,” Q says. “She was on set a lot, and she was really supportive of the process”—even when that process meant altering her dialogue to better suit the big screen. “The sides I got when I was reading with Shai for the role, it was funny because it was dialogue really taken from the book,” Q reveals, laughing. “People don’t necessarily speak that way, in novel-language. It is different. That’s why adaptations are so important.”
In the end, though, the entire team crafted a believable dystopian world on screen. “The production design, the effects, the costumes, it all worked together,” Q says. “It nicely dovetailed to make this world really believable.”
So believable, in fact, that Q and Phifer could see themselves belonging in this world.“[Dauntless] are the more carefree, edgy, fun, no-inhibitions kind of folks,” Phifer says. “You see them catching the train, see them climbing up stuff, running and jumping, and [stopping], dropping, and rolling and they shoot guns. If I had to choose a faction, that would be the faction I think I would go with.”
Q agrees with the appeal of the Dauntless lifestyle. “It’s reckless, and when do we ever get to celebrate that part of our personality? In this world, that celebration becomes its own faction, and they are a specific group of people who are security, police, border control. They’re the protectors, and so that recklessness has a place in this society. They’re all nuts, but it works.”
Phifer, however, has changed his mind. “I’d be Divergent,” he says: those who, like Tris, possess characteristics of more than one faction and thus pose a threat to the carefully controlled system.
Q is quick to point out that you’re supposed to say that. “Isn’t that the goal, really? You think of the metaphor for life. We all want to be all things, don’t we, in some sense.”

When did violent dystopia become a fundamental part of young adult fiction? Part of the appeal must lie in the sensationalist escapism offered by the worlds of pieces like “The Hunger Games” and “Divergent,” where morally charged rebellion is sexy and the hot, moody boy is always interested. But the limitations of the YA and PG-13 labels too often obstruct the depth of social commentary that the genre could pose, leaving room for little more than indulgent fantasy trips like Neil Burger’s “Divergent,” a visceral and evocative but confused and shallow vision of a world that too obviously would never be a reality.
The premise of “Divergent” is so initially nonsensical that the film seems to lose traction before the main characters are even introduced. Chicago, of all places, is the future metropolis of humanity, and the system of leadership that is never really elucidated has decided that separating its population into different factions based on personality traits is conducive to peace. The tritely reductive partitioning includes the cheerful, mindless farmers in Amity; the smart and power-hungry Erudite; Candor, who have no distinctive traits other than honesty; selfless and charitable Abnegation, who comprise the current leadership; and the attractive, strong police force of Dauntless, whose members must be brave enough to scale buildings for no reason and dye their hair.
Teenage heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) has recently learned that she is Divergent, or, in other words, shown through a simulated test that she is simultaneously intelligent, giving, and brave. Such complexity of character is apparently both incredibly rare and a lethal threat to the government, and she is thus counseled by her sympathetic tester to hide her results and simply choose a faction. She shocks her parents when she chooses to be initiated into Dauntless, though she comes from a family of Abnegation, and is quickly started on a training montage that takes up 80 percent of the film. The remaining 20 follows the leader of Erudite (a smug and sneering Kate Winslet) as she attempts to overthrow the government by cheerily executing all of Abnegation, while Tris attempts to stop her.
Appropriately tame romantic tension is introduced in the form of Four (Theo James), Tris’s Dauntless instructor, a tattooed beauty with a dark past. As Tris hones her physical and mental strength, there is scant character development to track, as little about her pre-Dauntless self is revealed at all. Woodley carries a sympathetic but not particularly interesting character with poise, at turns a teenager out of her depth and a reluctant leader. Tris’s small group of friends playfully buoy the thematic heavy-handedness with empathy and comic relief. Although Woodley’s acting occasionally reflects her name, James maintains an intriguing simmer of tangled emotions below his attractively stoic exterior. The chemistry between the two is surprisingly palpable, even as Tris, in true YA fashion, pulls back from a kiss just when it seems tongue might make an appearance and whispers, “I don’t want to go too fast.”
The remainder of the script is similarly groan-inducing; the kiss scene is preluded by a drawn-out euphemistic exchange about whether or not Tris wants to see Four’s back tattoo. One-liners turn comic when they’re not meant to—as he and tris scale a Ferris wheel during a high-stakes game of capture the flag, Four at one point murmurs, “Everyone’s afraid of something” while the camera gazes down at his face, framed by Tris’s leathered thigh gap.
There is some merit to the unexpected rawness of the film’s staging and unapologetic physicality and emotionality; hand-to-hand combat scenes are both elegant and brutal, and the clear, sweeping divisions between factions, down to color-coded clothing, are unnerving. It is difficult not to gasp along with Woodley when she finds herself trapped in a flooding cage, or with Winslet when a knife sprouts in her outstretched hand. And though it’s predictable, towards the end of the film, that Tris will begin losing the people closest to her, Woodley’s heartbreaking meltdown is no less wrenching for it.
Those redeeming moments, however, are undone when the film yanks itself back onto its derivative premise; it’s hard to find appeal in a world where human complexity is treated as a one-in-a-million case, and it’s disappointing that the genre of YA literature has taken a turn to the convergent.

​Some music feels so exactly suited to a certain setting that it calls forth in the listener memories of a particular time and place. “Darlings,” the new solo album by Broken Social Scene lead Kevin Drew, fits solidly into this category. Simultaneously fun-loving and introspective, confident and intimate, “Darlings” evokes the carefree days and long, unhurried nights of summer.
 
"Darlings" is Drew’s second solo release, following 2007’s “Spirit If,” which earned praise for its catchy hooks, rich orchestration, and wonderfully earnest lyrics on love and longing. On “Spirit If,” songs like “Tbtf” and “When It Begins” spoke of infatuation, of the excitement and sense of breathless, boundless possibility contained in a first glimpse or touch. Other tracks focused on loss; “I really think we did the best we could,” Drew reassures on “Gang Bang Suicide.” On the whole, “Spirit If” was a refreshingly honest take on relationships and the ways they blossom, wither, and eventually end.
 
"Darlings" ​continues that trajectory, eschewing swagger and pretense to deliver a sweetly upbeat meditation on the trials of love in the modern age. Drew takes a frank approach to both the hollowness of emotional ties in today’s hookup culture and the shallowness with which those ties tend to be described. “Good Sex” is the immediate standout of the album, and the lyrics are as direct as the title would suggest. ​Over a steadily driving beat, Drew sings, “Good sex, it never makes you feel hollow / Good sex, it never makes you feel clean.” At first, the song seems to be a turn away from the romantic vulnerability of "Spirit If" to a brash, physical sexuality. ​Yet when the full instrumentation kicks in for the chorus (“But I’m still breathing with you, baby—I’m still breathing with you”), another message comes through: that despite the focused hypersexuality of this decade, in the end it’s all still about emotional connection.
 
This theme—searching for sincerity in a superficial world—continues throughout the album. “You Gotta Feel It,” another of the album’s high points, features soaring, worshipful choruses delivered through thick reverb, like a more existential Vampire Weekend. ​“My God,” the most stripped-down track on “Darlings,” is a slow, whispery burner with all the intimacy of a confessional. “My God, did you really give up?” Drew asks before sliding into a falsetto for the bridge, “Are you dreaming? What are you dreaming about now?” Throughout most of the song, Drew’s voice is set against only a metronome-like beat and a few piano chords. The simplicity is astonishing when compared to Broken Social Scene’s intricately layered productions, but it works. “It’s Cool” is similarly meditative, while “Body Butter” and “Bullshit Ballad” are more uptempo but still not overdone.
 
​Drew’s new aptitude for restraint shows itself throughout the entire aesthetic of the album. Setting aside any and all lyrical meaning or message, “Darlings” is simply thoroughly enjoyable music. The relative spareness of the arrangements allow touches of soul and blues to shine through, saving the record from synthy indie-rock anonymity and creating an effortlessly confident, relaxed tone. The songs alternate between bouncy and laid-back, but they share both a detached, irrepressible pleasantness and a belief in the inherent value of love. After the release of "Spirit If," Drew was heralded as a new iteration of the true romantic, but it is "Darlings," with its effortless mix of lightheartedness and gravity, that will cement that reputation.

Liars are a band known for change—their style of music shifts as rapidly as their band members do, from punk to rock to electronic and back. They tell stories, change paradigms, and utilize new and exciting instruments. Though several of their albums have received Pitchfork’s “Best New Music” tag, they’ve notoriously received bottom marks from Rolling Stone and Spin. They never fail to impress or at least surprise.
 
“Mess” is no different. It’s striking, in a word. The songs fluctuate between ethereal calmness and a jubilant, if stressed and anxious, pulsating rhythm. Most tracks are robotic in nature, their sounds made up of inhuman shouts and sounds that seem to come from a synthesizer rather than a guitar or drums. Yet the album is human, its arc seemingly that of an individual on the road to discovering himself.
This could be due to the band’s mastery of electronic music with this album. Where their last, “WIXIW,” launched the trio into the territory of electronica, this album seems to bring that endeavor home. Every song, whether fast-paced or pulsating and slow, is made up of a well-executed electronic hook and background noises which are both alien and inhuman.
 
“Can’t Hear Well” repeats the same wave-like synthetic sound throughout, but the result isn’t boring or overdone—it simultaneously draws listeners in and repels them. The voice that speaks over the music is distorted to the point of incomprehension, its intonations muddled and robotic. The only truly decipherable lyric intimates, appropriately, the song’s title. “Can’t hear well,” says the voice near the end of the track, and the listener can’t help but feel that band itself, or the creature at the heart of the album, feels this way—confused, misunderstood, and lost in the void of the music. The track is, after all, at the middle of the album and the sometimes-disjointed journey.
 
But this sense of confusion quickly becomes the soul of the album. “Mess” begins with a muddled voice that intones, “Take my pants off. Use my socks. Smell my socks. Eat my face off. Eat my face off. Take my face. Give me your face.” By the end, that voice has been refined, a clearer version of itself that seems to be from the Twilight Zone. “Say the word limb. Say the word name. Say the word limb. Say the word shout. Say the word sound. Say the word mine. Say the word die. Say the word limb.” This is all said as though in the middle of a medical test or a psychological evaluation, like something has been born and must be checked for errors.
 
The aesthetic of robotic life-giving is furthered by the album’s colorful artwork. What seems to be an electric fan is draped with a rainbow of colored yarn which, one can imagine, would spring to life as the fan is turned on. This is the feeling of many of the more exciting songs on the album, such as “Mess On A Mission.” The track is set to a fevered rhythm and the singer utters, “Facts are fact and fiction’s fiction” before launching into a wild, repeated shout of “A mess on a mission.” The track also features the album’s most clear and prominent lyrics, intoning “Cast out of culture... / Trash the book, the film, fell face off.” Perhaps this is the band’s own self-reflection on their mission and their art—remote, revolutionary.
 
If so, it is an appropriate anthem for a band like Liars. Having recreated themselves time and time again, each album a new sound, a new experience, and the creation of a new artist, the band cements its place in music through the highly self-aware “Mess.” Not only have they successfully transformed themselves again, they will revolutionize their music over and over—a mess that is constantly shifting itself. Liars have proven themselves a band on a course of creation, destruction, and recreation.

What’s a bar band, anyway? For a decade, The Hold Steady has drawn the label and merited none of its meanings: lazy songwriting, middling musicianship, and vanilla lyrics. The Brooklyn quintet’s frontman Craig Finn has a talent for worldbuilding that rivals that of artistic collaborator George R. R. Martin, spinning Kerouacian stories about wayfaring Catholic junkies who make pipes out of Pringles cans and spit white noise when they kiss. As Finn sings on “Separation Sunday,” the band’s sophomore effort, “We mix our own mythologies; we push them out through PA systems.”
 
Change that line to the past tense and you’d get a pretty good epitaph, too—which The Hold Steady might need sooner rather than later. On “Teeth Dreams,” the band’s sixth album, they sound destined for the worst kind of artistic death: a slow, comfortable decline into uncreativity and irrelevance. Think Smashing Pumpkins. Think Pixies. Think (gulp) Weezer. Now, of all times, The Hold Steady is finally starting to sound like a bar band.
 
In itself, “Teeth Dreams” is no catastrophe—it’s a below average, boring rock album, just like the one it follows in The Hold Steady’s discography, “Heaven Is Whenever.” Unfortunately for Finn and company, after nailing their first four records (“Almost Killed Me” through “Stay Positive”), they get graded on that curve. And compared to those albums, “Teeth Dreams” just feels like it’s been done before. The nine-minute album closer “Oaks” is a hodgepodge of reheated Hold Steady melodies whose chorus features the group’s least endearing reference yet to their own name (“Keep the speed steady / Hold the wheel straight”). The riff that runs throughout “Wait Awhile” is almost a carbon copy of the nine-year-old one from “Chicago Seemed Tired Last Night.” Even Finn’s lyrics seem slightly self-parodying at this point: “Big Cig” actually starts with the lines “She says she always smokes cigarettes / Ever since she was seven / She always likes the big ones best / You get more for your money.”
 
I’d have more to say about the lyrics on “Teeth Dreams,” but the album’s cluttered mix and unnecessary addition of second guitarist Steve Selvidge makes it pretty difficult to distinguish Craig Finn’s vocals. When you can hear them, though, they’re not delivering the same wistful, detailed narratives that found The Hold Steady its most devoted fans. The chorus of “On with the Business” is an empty exercise in à la carte heaviness: “Blood on the carpet / Mud on the mattress / Waking up with that American sadness... Pledge of Allegiance / War of attrition / So many choices: decisions, decisions.”
 “Teeth Dreams” has some decent songs, especially the auspiciously acoustic “Almost Everything” and the power ballad “The Ambassador,” but none that would have cracked the final track listing on one of The Hold Steady’s best albums. Whatever you want to attribute the band’s decline to—the departure of keyboardist and creative genius Franz Nicolay in 2010, Craig Finn’s burgeoning solo career, or a simple lack of new ideas—it’s happening, and it’s depressing. To paraphrase a decade-old Hold Steady track that seems completely foreign at this stage, certain songs get scratched into our souls—but not the ones on “Teeth Dreams.”

With the release of “Attack on Memory” in 2012, Cloud Nothings shed their old image of power-pop for a darker flair. With the old discarded, the indie rock band is entering an era of experimentation, something the members attempt in “Here and Nowhere Else.” Proclaimed by the group as “noisier” than previous compilations, the new album distinguishes itself from its predecessor. From the moment the first track plays, Cloud Nothings bombards the ears with an upbeat tempo, replete with warm guitar lines and propulsive percussion that carries the beat forward. Unlike in “Attack on Memory,” which contained slower melodies to reflect its melancholic mood, this energetic rhythm extends to every song on the album. 
 
The effect is a more positive album, supported further by the striking lyrics. Repetition perpetuates the lyrics and solidifies the album’s simple mindset, devoid of angst and pain. The simplicity does not make Cloud Nothings’s creation inane, however, and the hidden complexity grants greater power than an obvious display of intricacy. The lyrical progression uses thematic development to reflect this delicate sophistication—while frontman Dylan Baldi laments “Psychic trauma returns with age” and “My mind is always wasted listening to you” on “Psychic Trauma,” he ends the album stating, “I’m learning how to be here and nowhere else / How to focus on what I can do myself” in “I’m Not Part of Me.”
 
But the tone is not what distinguishes Cloud Nothings’s new album the most from their previous works; it is the well-executed instrumentation. The band’s lo-fi, punk sound remains, but the melodies are more hectic, filled to the brim with discordant beats and a mess of instruments. Done incorrectly, the result could be a barrage of incompatible sounds, but Cloud Nothings manages to blend every instrument together to form coherent strands. The singing acts as an instrument itself, deftly switching from softer harmonies to a guttural boom that overpowers the drums in volume. In “Quieter Today,” Baldi’s raspy voice reigns, except at times of clarity when Baldi admits “Every time I feel okay / My heart moves forward.” The deliberate transition pays off, giving the song a raw emotional weight.
 
This careful orchestration is prevalent throughout the album, reaching a high point in the penultimate track, “Pattern Walks.” In the transitioning interlude between the first half of the song and the finale, the guitar trills into an electronic buzz. It is reminiscent of “Wasted Days” in their previous album, but the created noise is more controlled, less of a continuous drone. Other sounds—a volcanic booming and a brief sliding whistle—accompany the synthesized hum. The nuances allow for variation from a potentially exhausting tune. A powerful build-up cements the maturity found in the album. As the song reaches its final leg, Baldi repeats “I fall” continuously, his voice and the instruments blurring into one another. The steady drumming, the intermittent strikes from the guitar, the repetition, the gradual crescendo—all add up together for a startling conclusion.
 
The individual songs carry potential, but the issue with the album is that it lacks cohesion. Cloud Nothings achieves the noisy album they wanted, but this success has a cost: the eclectic mix of sounds varies too greatly, overpowering any chance for an overarching rhythm among the tracks. The promotional single “I’m Not Part of Me” exhibits the greatest disjunction. Lyrically, it represents a final epiphany in the album’s thematic development, but musically, its mixture of pop and alternative rock sounds foreign and improper for the album’s grunge aesthetic. The transitions between earlier songs also lack connection. While “Quieter Today” jumps into guttural singing and loud beats, “Psychic Trauma” begins with more pop than garage fuzz; though the latter song eventually delves into punk, it cannot wash away a sense of detachment between the two tracks. The result is a lasting testimony that quick tempo is not enough to create unity.
 In “Here and Nowhere Else,” Cloud Nothings is successful in their approach. The thoughtful musicality and lyricism breeds a happier mood and suggests maturity and growth. Yet while the individual components are noteworthy, the album as a whole lacks any spark, detracting from what could have been a staggering accomplishment for the band.

Every time the Wu-Tang Clan gets together nowadays, it’s like a holiday reunion of a giant, squabbling family: there are generally good vibes and quality bonding, but also plenty of tension, in-fighting, and incompatibility. The group is back together again for the 20th anniversary of their first classic, “36 Chambers,” and there’s been no lack of drama. As of now, they might release an album, or they might not; it won’t have key member Raekwon on it, and it might not have Ghostface Killah, either. For now, though, they’ve left us with at least one single: “Keep Watch” is a decent-enough appetizer, provided that the main course actually arrives.
 
The song moves along with a silky hook from longtime Wu-Tang producer DJ Mathematics and features two veritable masters (Method Man and GZA) and two less recognizable members of the posse (Inspectah Deck and Cappadonna). The latter two more or less show why they never got the attention of their peers, but still add plenty of character and bravado to the track.
 
The Wu-Tang Clan has always been so fascinating because of the diversity in style and content of the different members, and nowhere is the contrast greater or more satisfying than on back-to-back verses by Cappadonna and GZA here. Cappadonna immediately declares himself a “project nigga” and attacks the beat viciously; GZA, the chess fanatic and one-time Harvard guest speaker, then floats over the groove, philosophizing, “We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size / Interaction with the wise and civilized.”
 
There isn’t a classic verse on here, nor the urgency or camaraderie that the group displayed on “36 Chambers” 20 years ago. But “Keep Watch” still has plenty of attitude and slick wordplay, so let’s hope that the Wu-Tang Clan keeps making music as long as they can stand each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Johnny Cash is the greatest figure of American music. The big-voiced boy from Arkansas who struggled with women, liquor, and drugs, the man in black who fell hard but got up and sang harder, Cash was more than a singer, more even than an iconic singer—he was an archetype. “Live from Folsom Prison” is probably the single best concert album ever recorded; numbers like “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Ring of Fire” broke out of the categories of country, Americana, and gospel to become anthems the whole nation knew. His sense of rough justice, his concern for the little man, and his obsessive search for redemption made him not just an American singer, but The American Singer.
 
Cash died of complications from diabetes in 2003. As a result, it is an unusual privilege to hear an unreleased album, entirely new to the public’s ears. “Out Among the Stars,” recorded in the ’80s and forgotten until the master tapes’ rediscovery by Cash’s son in 2012, gives tracks that can rival the master’s best work. The ’80s were one of the nadirs of country music as slick pop sounds infiltrated Nashville and corrupted the raw, rough-edged sound at the heart of the genre—in other words, a situation not too far off from today’s. Columbia, Cash’s label at the time, wanted this sort of music, oily and easy to sell. When Cash refused to compromise his sound, they put away his recordings indefinitely. Happily, these are now where they belong, in easy reach of listeners.
 
The album begins in typical Johnny Cash fashion with the country standard “Out Among the Stars,” written by Adam Mitchell and covered by the likes of Merle Haggard. Yet while Haggard’s rendition moans and whines under the greasy production one would expect on a Judy Collins song, Cash’s arrangement opts for traditional country—a thumping double-bass and jangling piano welcome the listener to the album. “It’s midnight at a liquor store in Texas,” Cash booms out seconds later, assuring the audience that he is back and in fine form. His delivery is typical—in contrast to Haggard’s pathetic, almost comical performance, he has a wryness that conveys sympathetically but unsentimentally the facts and human strangeness behind the holdup that the song describes.
 
This emphasis on musicality over production is perhaps the dominant theme of this album. The single released for it is “She Used to Love Me a Lot,” originally recorded by David Allen Coe in 1984. This track shows Johnny Cash at his darkest, recalling more than anything his final song, “Hurt.” Cash’s famously deep voice conveys regret, brooding, and even despair as he laments, “I saw her through the window today / She was sittin’ in the Silver Spoon Café / I started to keep going, but something made me stop; / She used to love me a lot.” The Elvis Costello remix that was released as the the b-side for the single is perhaps the only error in the handling of the album’s release: Costello’s strange swooshing additions do nothing but emphasize the grandeur of Cash’s vocals and the original arrangement.
 
Poetically enough for what will probably be the last original Johnny Cash album ever released, the final song is an original spiritual, “I Came to Believe.” The fact that his firm, unironic Christian faith is the last word on his recording career, more than a decade after his death, is as he would want it.
 In a time when pop-stars in chaps like Brad Paisley and Taylor Swift are the standard-bearers for country music and the traditional sounds of the genre are consigned to fringe Americana groups like Old Crow Medicine Show, “Out Among the Stars” will stand as a challenge to the plastic face of the new Nashville. Hopefully a change will come. Whatever the case, this album is a fitting cap on the Johnny Cash discography. “Out Among the Stars” is indeed out there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Joanna Newsom doesn’t get enough credit for her album covers. Her 2006 breakthrough “Ys” bears a detailed, Northern Renaissance-style portrait of the harpist holding a scimitar, while a fittingly maximalist rococo assemblage tops her 2010 triple-album “Have One on Me.” My favorite, though, is her first: the patchwork pictures of planes, balloons, narwhals, and more that encircle a macaroni-encrusted photograph of Newsom on the cover of her 2004 debut, “The Milk-Eyed Mender.”
 
A lot has changed for Joanna Newsom in the decade since she released “The Milk-Eyed Mender.” She’s collaborated with the quasi-mythical musician Van Dyke Parks, modeled for Armani, and married the man responsible for “I Just Had Sex” (Andy Samberg, not Akon). If she wanted to take a page from the books of Annie Clark and Ms. Shawn Carter, she could title her upcoming fourth album “Joanna Newsom” and no one would bat an eyelid.
 
It would be easy to treat “The Milk-Eyed Mender” as a sort of quaint, crystallized origin story for Joanna Newsom’s growing legend. Set alongside her other albums, its 12 songs are shorter, its lyrics less Spenserian, its singing less tuned—and you can forget about orchestral arrangements. In a world biased toward big, expensive statements, “The Milk-Eyed Mender” is no musical Versailles. But the album represents much more than a juvenile sketch, a proof of concept for a future masterpiece—it is a masterpiece, itself, and one that should stand on its own in Joanna Newsom’s career.


 
You won’t hear it on any party playlists, but “The Milk-Eyed Mender” is all about rhythm, which is what initially drew me to it as a J Dilla and RZA-obsessed teenager. From the stuttering harp loops of “Bridges and Balloons” that open the album, to the hidden waltz of “Cassiopeia,” to the harpsichord avalanche that engulfs the end of “Peach, Plum, Pear,” “The Milk-Eyed Mender” is driven by the textured pulses Newsom weaves around her wavering voice. It’s no mistake that Joanna Newsom has called the album her “love-song to the harp,” because it’s the one on which her skill on the instrument takes center stage. Sometimes her ideas are simple: the subtle syncopation in “The Sprout and the Bean” or the chopped arpeggios laid bare in “The Book of Right-On”—which was later sampled by The Roots, if the hip-hop comparison seems iffy at first glance—but they always work. Comparing the punctuated miniatures of “The Milk-Eyed Mender” to the gorgeously meandering tapestries of “Ys” is like stacking David Foster Wallace’s essays up against “Infinite Jest”—why bother?


 
Speaking of authors, Joanna Newsom mentions exactly one on “The Milk-Eyed Mender,” when a character “fashion[s] a cap from a page of Camus.” It’s a strange moment—somehow, even as an electric organ bubbles beneath the line, the reference feels anachronistic, as if the album on which it appears should easily predate “The Stranger.” To be fair, one song on it does: “Three Little Babes,” an Appalachian traditional by Texas Gladden. But even the rest of “The Milk-Eyed Mender” evokes the medieval more than the millennial, with its mentions of knights, dragons, caravels, and kings. To me, though, it’s the total absence of irony that makes “The Milk-Eyed Mender” seem from a different time. There’s nothing tongue-in-cheek about the way Newsom paints herself as “big-boned and fey” in “Sprout and the Bean”; not a flippant syllable to be found in this stunning, title-dropping stanza from “Sadie”: “Down where I darn with the milk-eyed mender / You and I, and a love so tender / Is stretched on the hoop where I stitch this adage: / ‘Bless this house and its heart so savage.’” There were many, many great albums released in 2004—“The College Dropout,” “Franz Ferdinand,” “Blueberry Boat,” “Funeral”—but none as unaffected and endearing as Joanna Newsom’s debut.


 
It’s almost a cliché to call Joanna Newsom uncool at this point. Make anyone reach for a dictionary (or, in the case of “Cassiopeia,” a copy of Edith Hamilton) and they’ll assume your ideas are as esoteric and eggheaded as your words. But if the songs on “The Milk-Eyed Mender” are about anything, it’s the mundane: a departed dog (“Sadie”), a flirtatious encounter gone wrong (“Peach, Plum, Pear”), and dropping out of school (“en Gallop”). Even the album’s most self-awarely Saussurean song, “This Side of the Blue,” (“And the signifieds butt heads with the signifiers / And we all fall down slack-jawed to marvel at words!”) is ultimately just about getting on with day-to-day life. It’s been talked about more with Joanna Newsom’s later albums, but there’s a unique literary quality to “The Milk-Eyed Mender” as well; one that, for a musical comparison, evokes Nick Drake’s lilting epigrams and Jeff Mangum’s richly physical images. Rarity is the mother of coolness, and Joanna Newsom’s talent is rare—if you or I or anyone else tried to recreate the words that make up “The Milk-Eyed Mender,” it’d come out sounding like “Puff, the Magic Dragon” fan fiction.


 
It’s worth listening to “Walnut Whales” and “Yarn and Glue,” the two demo EPs that Joanna Newsom put out before Will Oldham convinced Drag City to finance her full-length debut, if only for the realization of just how painstakingly planned and calculated “The Milk-Eyed Mender” is. The early EP versions of the album’s songs often feature wildly different tempo and instrumentation, as well as more subtle discrepancies in performance style and word choice (Newsom has admitted to an “obsessiveness over syntax.”) There’s also the mostly undiscussed matter of which songs actually ended up appearing on “The Milk-Eyed Mender.” Back in 2004, Newsom sacrificed many great songs to obscurity (“What We Have Known,” “Erin,” “Flying a Kite”) simply because she couldn’t perform them “without feeling a little disingenuous.” These days, it feels trite to talk about artistic vision, but take this for what it’s worth: every syllable, note, and second of silence on “The Milk-Eyed Mender” is there because Joanna Newsom wanted it to be.

A Harvard faculty member since January 2014 and the recipient of a 2013 MacArthur Fellowship, the internationally renowned jazz pianist and composer Vijay Iyer splits his time between duties in Cambridge, New York City, and on tour promoting “Mutations,” his March-released ECM Records debut. The Crimson caught up with the multitalented improviser before his March 14 concert, which featured former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinksy and the Vijay Iyer Trio in Sanders Theatre.
 
The Harvard Crimson: “Mutations,” your most recent album, incorporates elements of improvisation into a classically inspired strings framework. How does the cognition of an improvisational musician differ from that of a musician who is not improvising?
 
Vijay Iyer: That was the exact question I was asking myself…. [I was] writing not just for classical musicians but for myself, in the context of people who specifically don’t self-identify as improvisers. In this particular case, where our skill sets are having to somehow work together, where our priorities as musicians are in dialogue somehow, we find that we are actually coming from very different places; certainly they’ve submitted themselves to me being the composer of the piece, but then I have also invited them to make choices that I would classify as improvisational behavior, basically making real-time decisions about what to do and when to do it and how to do it. The emergent totality is something I can’t predict, so it thrusts all of us into the moment together because none of us know how it will sound four measures from now. It’s a score in the broadest sense, but it is more like a recipe.
 
THC: What do you feel is the most interesting area of investigation into music and music cognition at this time?
 
VI: I investigate as an artist. That is my research. I would like to see a serious commitment to cross-cultural work. What happens in the field of this research is that people try to make claims about music cognition, human cognition, but they don’t know what a human is. We are really speaking from the West even in ways that we can’t understand sometimes. There’s a research paper called “The Weirdest People in the World;” Weird is an acronym for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic, and basically all psychology research subjects are from that narrow strain of humanity. Beyond that they tend to be undergraduates, so that’s even smaller a strain, and from this we are trying to make universal claims about how the brain works, so we have not fully disambiguated cultural assumptions from our understanding of things like the psychology of music. I would like to see a true decades-long commitment to understanding music on a global scale, from that perspective: not to erase difference but to understand how difference could operate, change your understanding of what music even is. There’s a lot of work happening in terms of music and the brain, but some of this prejudice slips through in a way that is not very rigorous.
 
THC: How does your understanding of music as embodied action inform the way you listen to music, and the way you perform it?
 
VI: The way we talk about music is partly afflicted by our experience of listening to music separate from each other, our isolated, individualized earbud experience of music. That has influenced how we talk about it in such a way that we forget that we are forgetting what it was first: something that we did together, for each other. Also, what we forget is that the other thing we call music wouldn’t exist if that were not possible. Often people will [ask], 
“How does the brain perceive music as if music didn’t come from us, as if it just comes to us?” I tend to be kind of extravagantly speculative about the origins of music, to be almost irrational about it, to hypothesize, “Why? Why did we do this to begin with?” We have a way of talking about music as something that is not of us, something that we consume instead of do, something that doesn’t have a role in the foundations of what we are, but it’s a bit wacky to talk that way. Whenever I have that experience of “That isn’t music” [when listening to something], then that draws me toward it as an artist—that is exactly the kind of experience that I crave because it leads me to a new understanding of what music is. This thing that we call music maybe is so broad that we cannot theorize it separate from ourselves…maybe it is actually just what we do together with each other.
 
THC: How would you describe your experience so far at Harvard?
 
VI: Harvard is like the internet. You can really fill your life up with interesting things here. I have found, being with other artists here, my colleagues that are composers, for instance, that you have to be really protective of your time. You can’t just go to everything or sign up for everything; you have to have some time to be still with yourself and be able to create things.  I have friends and colleagues in all these different corners of the university—and their work is truly interesting. Part of why I am really interested in being here is to enrich my artistic perspective through this sort of thing, but I have to keep a balance, especially because I’m commuting between here and New York, where my family is, because that is a huge part of my life—a part of being human, to be part of a family—and I’m still learning. But I am fortunate to have a lot of good will everywhere I go here, so I am having a good time.

“Puppetry is physically hard work,” the puppeteer Joshua Holden said at the outset of a workshop for Harvard students in the Loeb Drama Center on March 12. “We need to warm up before we start.” It didn’t take long for me to understand why the full-body exercises were necessary. Holding up a puppet and maintaining my arm at a right angle for long stretches of time took more energy than I expected. After the warm-up, we each picked up a stuffed toy of our choice from Holden’s personal collection. I ended up with a creepy-looking rag doll with red braids and a plaid dress. Seeing six Harvard students sternly sitting with dolls in our laps, I couldn’t help but laugh.
Holden, a Massachusetts native with gelled jet-black hair, thick eyeliner, and a quiet personality, “never knew he was going to be a puppeteer.” He strayed from his initial dream of becoming an actor after stumbling into a puppeteering audition and getting the position. As his puppeteering career took off, Holden worked as a performer on the national tour of the “Sesame Street”-inspired musical “Avenue Q,” as well as being the lead puppeteer in Boston’s “Peter Pan 360” in 2010. 
After picking our dolls, we brought them to life. The simple motion of slightly compressing the shoulders and the neck then releasing them rhythmically gave the impression that the doll was breathing in and out. They went from inanimate to animate objects; from things to beings. Holden also taught us the importance of slight variations in breathing. When it sped up, the breathing portrayed elation and excitement; when it slowed down, sadness. It was staggered to show that a character was crying but otherwise maintained a steady beat. For puppets, which are limited to few facial expressions, breath can be a crucial indication of their feelings.
Digging deeper into the physical lessons of puppetry, Holden told us to examine the shape of our jaws as we spoke. We held up our hands as if they were part of a puppet; as we counted numbers, if our jaw was open, we would open our hands and if our jaw was closed, we closed our hands too. When we said a word like “seventeen,” the hand would open and close three times once on each syllable. After this step, we received “eyeballs” (ping-pong balls on a circular elastic strap), which Holden told us to attach to our knuckles as we continued to practice. “This is how people rehearse for ‘Sesame Street,’ because they can’t take the puppets home,” Holden remarked. With the eyeballs creating the impression of a face, we practiced turning our wrists right and left to imitate the gaze of the puppet. For the finale, we finally moved on from dolls and fake eyeballs to real puppets. From a blonde, accessory-draped mistress to a French waiter with a blue mustache to a friendly, toothless lion, we witnessed an eclectic assortment of puppets from Holden’s collection come to life. 
After requests for a demonstration, Holden gently pulled out a sock puppet from a bright orange suitcase: his “soulmate,” Mr. Nicholas. Lacking any accessories, Mr. Nicholas was the simplest of all the puppets in Holden’s collection. However, he was also one of the most visually alluring, stretched in just the right places to form wrinkles, a line of black hair, and skeletal hands made of plastic. With Mr. Nicholas in hand, Holden launched into a monologue, playing the sock puppet as a lonely man sick of his retirement home, growing old, and ugliness. Holden’s short performance was captivating, featuring the sad yearnings of a grump interspersed between precisely timed pauses to allow for the deep, slow inhales of an old man. 
Today, few people dream of becoming a professional puppeteer. Puppetry still remains an industry geared towards a certain fandom, and something that not many children are very familiar with. But just two and a half hours with Joshua Holden was enough to teach me about the beauty of this old-fashioned practice and about the intimacy created between a person and a puppet that cannot be shared with a digital character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


“There’s no way GQ hired you to be a staff writer. So it’s obviously one of those advertorial sections, where it looks like a real article so they trick you into reading it, and then you find out it’s a paid advertisement. Which is both morally and creatively bankrupt. So who’s the sponsor?” So says the character Ray on “Girls,” in a recent season three episode of the show in which protagonist and aspiring writer Hannah gets a job in the advertorial department of GQ. His cynical view of ad-making is borne out by Hannah’s experience at the magazine. Hannah soon realizes that her co-writers are has-beens—their art has dried out, and they have sold out. Frustrated by the nature of “advertorial” work and terrified of ending up in the same place as her washed-up colleagues, Hannah simultaneously quits and is fired after a very public outburst. “Girls” may be pure fiction, but this made-for-TV plot speaks to a question that many artists are forced to confront—whether it is possible to earn a living in the advertising industry without “selling out.”
For student artists at Harvard, as well as students involved with business side of advertising, the answer appears to be yes. According to independent artists around campus, there will always be tension between the creation of art for art’s sake and the creation of artistic advertisements designed to sell a product. But technological advancements have opened up more avenues for creative innovations in the realm of advertising and are making the field appealing to artists for reasons that go beyond financial perks.
THROUGH THE AGES
Consumers began tuning into television shows in greater numbers and taking more notice of the 60-second commercial spots that aired after the newscasts. Many advertising agencies, like Young and Rubicam, produced their own shows, which maximized exposure to their diverse line of products. In 1948, three agency-produced shows—”Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” (produced by Y&R for Lipton), “Toast of the Town” with Ed Sullivan (Kenyon & Eckhardt for Ford’s Lincoln-Mercury division) and “Texaco Star Theater” with Milton Berle (Kudner Agency)—were hits that contributed to the surge in purchases of television sets. Though television commercials communicated ideas in a different medium, agencies still had their in-house creative teams draw storyboards for each scene.
Madison Avenue became synonymous with  advertising’s “golden age” in the 1950s and 1960s. Agencies in New York became just as famous for the talented individuals in their creative departments as for the work these agencies produced. One such individual was David Ogilvy, one of the founders of Hewitt, Ogilvy, Benson & Mather (now Ogilvy & Mather). Ogilvy gained fame for his ads promoting Rolls Royce cars and Dove soap bars, as the advertisements for these products represented a departure from traditional messaging for consumer products of this sort because of the more subtle nature of each campaign. He retired as chairman of Ogilvy and Mather in 1973 but remained a legend in the advertising world.
Ogilvy, Leo Burnett, and countless other Madison Avenue advertising figures ushered in a gilded age of print advertising. As consumerism in America rapidly expanded, creative leaders in these agencies continually found new and effective ways in which to glamorize the mundane. Don Draper, a character in the widely acclaimed television series “Mad Men,” embodies the various attitudes and characteristics of agency leaders in the ’60s, including an eye for the unusual, an intuitive sense about what resonates with an audience, and a relentless drive to succeed. Strong creative teams and talented artistic teams were the cornerstone of these agencies, as effective visualization in these print advertisements was the top priority for ad-makers.
 THE INTERNET AGE
The nature of advertising changed as technology began to increasingly dominate the way in which people collected information. In addition to more sophisticated television sets with a more diverse line of shows and commercials, people began to invest in home computers, cellular phones, and the still-rudimentary Internet. Because this new technology was so dynamic, any advertisements promoting new technology products had to be equally as interactive. Industry insiders working for a Forbes panel on Super Bowl advertisements agreed that a  watershed moment in technology advertising came in 1984 in the form of an Apple Inc. commercial promoting its Macintosh Personal Computer. Its story-like structure resonated with audiences long after the football game ended. The ad spot was rerun so many times by news outlets that the company estimates it gained about $5 million worth of free press from these favorable reactions . This was not an insignificant outcome, as Apple spent $900,000 making the commercial. Notably, the most popular commercials aired in the ’80s and ’90s featured artists (actors and musical artists) but did not glorify the work of copywriters and sketch artists working behind the scenes.
This trend became even more pronounced with the advent of internet advertising. The first banner ads were placed at the top of websites in 1994 and were shortly followed by pop-up ads and pay-per-click keyword advertising. Instead of changing the channel on a the television set during a commercial, Internet users were forced to encounter pop up ads as they clicked through to their desired pages--ads were unavoidable. As Youtube, Facebook, and other forms of social media gained prominence starting in 2006, online advertising began to slowly become more and more accessible. Advertising campaigns now became “viral” and videos promoting certain products could be shared on numerous sites by millions of people.For the first time, online campaigns allowed the consumer to actively interact with the product and the company behind the product, a dimension that print advertising could never fully replicate. Instead of carefully considered drawings, companies began searching for graphic designers with a working knowledge of digital advertising.
Modern advertising is in many ways similar to its earlier post-war roots, though there is a notable shift in the types of art that are successful in digital advertisements and the type of artists who can participate in the field. As a result, there exists a tension between the artistic community and this new advertising community, which in many ways has changed the way that we think of the industry.
 THE PROFESSIONALS
Visual aesthetics are certainly fundamental for Daniel A. Citron ’16. A student who has done extensive work in the realms of both design and filmmaking, Citron does not believe that there is a necessary division between advertising and art.
Citron’s background in design is considerable. Last year, he worked as a front-end designer for the team behind the redesign of courses.CS50.net. Citron has also done design work for Google, where he was employed as a film and design intern. Citron’s background in film is equally impressive. His films have been screened and won accolades at multiple film festivals, including the Los Angeles Film Festival, the] San Francisco International Film Festival, and the Seattle International Film Festival.
Though Citron is committed to continuing to produce work that is not connected to advertising, he said he would not consider working in advertising to be selling out. As someone who has worked in multiple fields of art production, Citron believes whether an advertisement is a commercial or a web-based design, it is the quality of the content rather than the particular medium utilized that determines whether the advertisement is also a work of art. “Advertising is essentially storytelling, no matter what medium you use” Citron says.
Citron also disagrees with the notion that artists working in advertisements are washed up. Asked for his opinion about former artists working in advertising, Citron is adamant that the artistic talents of these individuals should not be shortchanged. “I wouldn’t call them ‘former artists,’” he says. “They’re still artists.”
Citron grants that working in advertising may not provide the same amount of freedom as working on a personal creative project. But he believes that the particular art of advertising requires just as much artistic ability for success as personal artistic ventures, and also presents exciting challenges of its own. “For me, film has its own draw and design has its own draw. And I think advertising is its own medium that has a lot that’s very intriguing about it,” he says. “If you’re an artist that wants to go into advertising, it’s an interesting field because you’re constantly presented with creative problems to solve through your art.”
Sierra L. Katow ’16, a cartoonist whose work has appeared in a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, is more skeptical about the prospect of making a career in advertising. “Working in advertising is a less enticing option,” she says. “I would feel like it was not quite as true to what I want to be making as an artist.”
But Katow believes that the answer to the question of whether an artist who goes into advertising is selling out is dependent on the particular feelings of the artist. She states that if advertising represents a true interest for the artist, then pursuing a career in advertising is not selling out. However, “If you’re giving up what you want to do in order to do [advertising] then it might be.” One question with no room for doubt is the financial advantages of working in advertising. “It does seem like a practical option for getting a salary,” Katow says.
THE ADVOCATE
While student artists debate whether or not a career in advertising is a viable path, one student group at Harvard works to promote the interests of students eager to work in advertising. The Harvard Advertising and Marketing Club aims to teach and inform its members about careers in advertising and marketing, connecting them with professionals and experts in order to foster creativity and the exchange of knowledge. The club frequently acts a liaison between Harvard student artists and advertising companies, providing students with opportunities to intern or work at these companies. A student-run organization, HAMC focuses specifically on the undergraduate population. In recent years HAMC has received a number of awards. Most notably, a team of students representing HAMC placed in the top three teams at the 2011 FutureM marketing conference.
The outgoing co-president of HAMC, Kate A. Abraham ’14, says she firmly believes that advertisements have the potential to be works of art. Although primarily interested in the analytical aspect of the marketing at first, Abraham found herself increasingly drawn to the artistic side of the club, as more and more student artists were joining up to help do advertising for local organizations, such as the homeless shelter.
Abraham acknowledges that the fact that advertisements exist to make companies money complicates the view that they can be credible as works of art. “From my experience, there is this idea that art...should be almost pure in a sense—that it shouldn’t necessarily be just for profit or to persuade people to do something.”
But Abraham stresses that, for decades now, artists have been drawn to the advertising world. Whether for practical monetary reasons, or for the challenge that it presents, artists increasingly find themselves working in advertising. In Abraham’s opinion, working in advertising provides artists with a unique set of challenges that can be conducive to creativity. “The thing that I love about advertising and marketing is that it requires me to go a step beyond what I would do in my own creative projects because you are trying to encourage some sort of action,” says Abraham. “It’s very action-oriented, and I’m drawn to that. For me, it’s more complex and that’s why it’s interesting.”
As intertwined as art and advertisements are in marketing strategies, there have been some controversies and discord between the two worlds, something that speakers invited to lecture to HAMC have addressed before.
“There’s a lot of merit in just having art for art’s sake,” Abraham says. “I think there is a lot of pushback in the art community towards getting involved in advertising because you can’t just make the art you want to make you have to make the art that will be persuasive and engaging for an audience. So in that sense you’re limited in what it’s doing for you personally, but I think you can find a lot of enjoyment in your work.”
In discussing how the marriage of art and advertising can be construed as undermining the purity of a work of art, Abraham cited a well-known anecdote. “One thing that’s always stood out to me is Nike [using] the Beatles’ song ‘Revolution,’ and [the Beatles] ultimately suing Nike and saying, ‘We don’t write jingles; that this is a part of who we are, and we’re not going to put a value on it and just sell things.’”
But Abraham thinks that there is a difference between artists not wanting previously existing work to be used in advertisements and artists creating work expressly for the purpose of advertising a product. “I do believe there is tension [between art and advertising],” Abraham says. “But that doesn’t mean that advertisements don’t require artistic skills.”
Abraham believes that the advent of new media has had a positive impact on the relationship between advertisements and art, pushing advertisements further into the art world. In Abraham’s opinion, the transformation of the landscape of advertising in response to business demands, advances in technology, and cultural changes has bolstered the capacity of the advertising industry to attract artistic talent. “Advertising has become more artistic because there are so many more avenues,” Abraham says. “Now you have social media, and so many more outlets to connect with people.”
TWO-IN-ONE
While there are obvious downsides to advertising in the internet age (pop-ups, anyone?), it seems that the advertising industry is not entirely divorced from the artistic community in which it originated. The issue remains divisive for students who are less invested in the structure of the advertising world, but this tension serves as a critique of the way consumers process information about products—and not necessarily an indictment of the industry itself.

“We will wipe out Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed at a fiery campaign rally in Basra. Hours later, access to Twitter was completely blocked by Turkish authorities, who cited “court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens,” making Turkey only the second country in the world to ban the site. The first was China.
But this is just the latest setback in a decade-long deterioration of press freedom in both the East and the West.
For Turkey, the drastic move comes just before the embattled prime minister faces municipal elections—he’s been in power for 11 years and is struggling to survive an expansive anti-corruption investigation that already claimed three senior cabinet members in December.
Erdogan has stridently decried the inquiry as a “dirty operation” orchestrated by followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential Sufi mystic who was once a close ally of the prime minister’s AKP party. Erdogan relied on Gullen’s influence among the police and judiciary to defang a coup-prone Turkish army, eventually convicting more than 300 army officers for plotting to overthrow the new government in 2003. Now, the 20 high-ranking prosecutors who were working on the inquiry were reassigned, often to remote parts of the country.
One desperate move leads to another: Interference with the prosecutors has not stopped a torrent of embarrassing leaks that have been publicized over Twitter and Facebook. Already, one Azeri journalist who tweeted links to articles about the graft scandal was barred from entering Turkey for “posting tweets against high-level state officials.” The straw that broke Erdogan’s back was a leaked recording of apparent phone conversations between the prime minister and his son Bilal, in which father instructed son to hide vast sums of money.
“Get all that stuff in our house out, OK?” Erdogan appears to say. “Dad, could that be? There is your money in that safe,” the younger man alleged to be Bilal responds. “That’s what I mean,” the older man responds.
The straightforward reading of Erdogan’s censorship is one of a ruler’s desperate grasping after fleeting power—much like Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s complete cutting off of his country’s internet traffic in the early days of the Syrian conflict, or the outages Hosni Mubarak’s regime caused during his final days in power.
In a way, that explanation—the errant and erratic moves of floundering autocrats—is comforting. Yes, it deeply concerns the world when a dictator transgresses on essential freedoms of expression and the press, but at least it is the will of one megalomaniac, not the will of one people.
But what of the country that democratically wills itself into the ugly jaws of censorship?
The United Kingdom, certainly no one’s idea of an undemocratic society, has seen its press freedoms erode, with the Guardian newspaper consistently harassed over its detailed exposés on the mass surveillance programs of the American and British governments. Agents of the Government Communications Headquarters—the British analogue of the National Security Agency—oversaw the forced destruction of the newspaper’s computer hard drives. 
In October, Prime Minister David Cameron threatened, “It would be very difficult for the government to stand back and not act,” if newspapers “don’t demonstrate some social responsibility,” and stop publishing stories that the government finds damaging.
That these actions are probably within the bounds of British law, as the British courts seem to think, is more discomforting to me than if they weren’t. It’s not as egregious as the Turkish overreach, but the erosion of press freedom anywhere simply can’t be ignored.
In the United States, the Obama Administration’s dogged commitment to leak investigations has led to a similar backslide. Since he took office in 2009, eight leaks have been prosecuted under the Espionage Act, compared to the three prosecutions under all previous presidents combined—investigations that apparently allow the Justice Department to secretly seize phone records from the Associated Press and necessitate the continuing prosecution of the New York Times reporter James Risen for not revealing the sources who informed him of a secret CIA program to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program.
An especially haunting sentence from the Fourth Circuit decision reads: “There is no First Amendment testimonial privilege, absolute or qualified, that protects a reporter from being compelled to testify by the prosecution or defense in criminal proceedings about criminal conduct that the reporter personally witnessed or participated in.” This judicial move—the equation of reporting with espionage itself—does not bode well for the future of national security journalism, where confidentiality of sources is often the only way to hold governments to account.
But the history of the free press is characterized by periods of expansion and regression. Troubled times breed fear, and fear breeds opportunistic politicking. Fear of communism begot McCarthyism, and fear of terrorism begot the Patriot Act and today’s expanded national security apparatus.
But open societies have a self-correcting aspect that gives me hope. Though it often takes far too long, the right decisions are often reached.
A free press is the necessary precursor to transparent governance—the ideal of democracy. People, whether in Istanbul, London, or Washington, recognize that.
And recognition will always be the first step toward right action.

Recent Department of Education data have revealed that great racial disparity exists in preschool suspensions, with minority students disproportionately more likely to be suspended than their white peers. The statistics are staggering, and African-American preschool students are the most adversely impacted. While they constitute only 18 percent of the preschool population, they receive 42 percent of all preschool suspensions. We are worried by this trend and by the concept of out-of-school suspensions in general. Further, the reasons behind this discrepancy in suspensions need to be examined. 
While we understand that schools have a responsibility to create safe environments and address behavioral problems, a policy of out-of–school suspensions is probably not an effective or appropriate means to that end. Children at three or four years old are too young to be held fully accountable for their own motives and decisions, or to feel responsible for their own education. Additionally, the behavior that prompts such suspensions may be caused by factors outside the students’ control, such as access to violent television shows in the home.  Punishing children for their behavior by removing them from school is unlikely to solve these outside problems.
When behavioral problems do arise, schools should seek more constructive, alternate methods to address the issue. An out-of-school suspension simply sends a students home, which may not always convey a message of disappointment to children: They might even see it as a break. Additionally, if the issue is one that stems from home life, having children spend more time at home will not rectify the situation, but worsen it instead. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, all students have a right to education, and sending them home cuts their time in school, undermining that goal.
We hope that schools eliminate out-of-school suspensions—but in the meantime, it is especially important that those suspensions are not meted out in a racially-biased way. There is already a significant racial achievement gap, and any system that disproportionately denies education to students of a given race needs to be changed. To that end, those schools with particularly significant disparities in their suspension rates should reexamine their methodology and eliminate any prejudicial policies. The government, furthermore, should critically examine those schools that continue to have notable differences in their systems of punishment and response. We firmly resist the notion that behavioral problems at the preschool level can be solved by kicking students out of school. The status quo does just that, and appears to hurt minority students most of all.

When it comes to international affairs, the opinionated world’s favorite game to play is “Who’s the Hypocrite?” Whether it is the United States invading a country on false pretences or Russia gobbling up Sevastopol, editorial pages and politicians alike are quick to point out an action’s duplicitous nature.
Moments after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s condemnations of the United States last year over the possibility of U.S. intervention in Syria, most memorably made in a New York Times op-ed, accusations about his hypocrisy were flung like primate feces at the Moscow Zoo. Americans vehemently charged: “How dare he invoke international law when the human rights record of Russia is so dismal that it makes North Korea look like Knott’s Berry Farm?”
Now, with Putin’s recent Crimean meddling presents a new, if predictable, meta-twist to this endless barrage. Not only have these anti-Russian polemics resurged, but Putin has also blasted the West‘s hypocrisy in their denunciation of him. 
Virtually 100 percent of the time, these allegations of hypocrisy are factually correct.
Certainly when it comes to the United States’s condemnations of Russia and Putin’s fightin’ words, it is true that both are afflicted by terribly timely cases of selective amnesia. In fact it isn’t farfetched to posit that any significant global action from either of these former superpowers would be hypocritical. Even if Russia were to try to rectify past ills through something like increased foreign aid, U.S. pundits and politicians would pounce, declaring the move somehow disingenuous and self-serving. And as for the United States, even if the country has bettered the world in innumerable ways, a history of dispossession and subjugation this thick will never be unstuck.
Though these accusations of hypocrisy are bountiful and true, upon inspection, this nose-thumbing is about as valuable as the lies politicians make to defend hypocritical claims in the first place. 
Declaring that a country’s actions are hypocritical ought to carry as much argumentative weight as pointing out a grammatical error in a 200-page thesis or catching a slip-of-the-tongue during a debate opponent’s speech. It is a cheap trick that riles up readers and crowds, but considering that hypocrisy is not just common but also unavoidable in foreign affairs, it is the pointless, bedizened version of clickbait.
Perhaps today’s aspirant Émile Zolas think that the charge of hypocrisy is valuable because hypocritical agents deserve punishment. This logic makes sense when thinking about how to deal with people under a system of laws. The law is erected to prevent hypocrisy—hypocrites aren’t to be trusted, their actions ought to be stopped. 
But what makes this logic sound in the first place is twofold. First, we operate under the premise that people are able to not be hypocrites. Second, we rely on the law to have the force to stop hypocrisy. When we zoom out to the level of countries and their drunken, testosterone-driven displays, we see that neither of these premises exists anymore. 
The reasoning against the first has already been explained, but as for the second, the world’s obsession with the phantasm that is international law fuels the gotcha, finger pointing, “I-told-you-so” elements behind claims of hypocrisy in the first place. International law is supposedly the thing that makes something like Putin’s annexation of Crimea condemnable. And Putin’s main charge against the United States is that it is a just-as-frequent violator of international law as Russia is. 
It is not even mildly conspiratorial to say that international law is a sham, both in the sense that it can be meaningfully violated and in the sense that it can be meaningfully enforced. Maybe this is because the U.N. has the political and military prowess of a flaccid piece of French toast, or maybe it’s because powerful countries emasculate the body in the first place, or maybe it’s because the world isn’t properly represented in its hallowed, ear-pieced, bouncy-castle halls. Regardless of what the answer is, the fact that international law is not taken seriously by the agents it is supposed to operate on (countries), saps it of value and renders it limp. 
In this limpness, international law loses its ability to determine right and wrong. The wrongness of any given action cannot be determined by the degree to which it defies a non-existent entity. 
When Russia annexes sovereign land it is wrong. Yes, it also violates “international law,” and, yes, this action is hypocritical: The sky is also blue and candy tastes sweet. The obsession with pointing out hypocrisy avoids important questions about the wrongness of any given action. It is a tempting distraction, but it is a hollow one when indicting countries that are forced to be hypocritical, and are governed by no one.

Two weeks ago, Amy L. Chua ’84, better known to the world as the Tiger Mother, and her husband Jed Rubenfeld paid a visit to Cambridge to talk about their new book, “The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America.” There has been much controversy about this book, both among actual scholars and among me and my friends. 
So when I heard that these two were coming to campus, I knew that it was my responsibility as a stereotypically successful Chinese-American man to go and check it out.
The book delineates eight groups of Americans that seem to be really good at capitalism (Chinese-Americans and Jewish-Americans, of course, given the authors’ own identities, plus Nigerian-Americans and Cuban-Americans just for good measure, to deflect those pesky accusations of racism). 
It then posits that these groups all share three characteristics that help to explain why they’re so good at capitalism—a superiority complex, a sense of insecurity, and strong impulse control. You need to believe that your people are better than everyone else, but also paradoxically need to have a chip on your shoulder and feel like you have something to prove. You need to be able to spend long hours working hard and deferring instant gratification for future rewards. This sounds much like the advice Kanye West gave us back on his debut album, “The College Dropout.”
It would be a bold move to try to explain American social inequities with the claim that some groups are just inherently more Kanye-like than others, ignoring other possible explanations like slavery, the failure of public education, the prison industrial complex, etc.
Chua and Rubenfeld recognized this much, so they prefaced their talk with a candid acknowledgement that structural forces are always at play, but that their book is not technically about that. They articulated that they’re not trying to why explain Asians and Jews are more successful than poor black and brown folks, because much has already been written on the oppression of the latter—they’re only trying to explain why Asians and Jews seem to be more successful than their white counterparts.
But even if we take Chua and Rubenfeld at their word and assume that this book is about what ordinary white people can learn from successful minority groups, the question remains: Are these cultural traits sufficient to catalyze social and economic mobility? If members of oppressed groups adopted the triple package (superiority, insecurity, and impulse control), would they suddenly ascend to Kanye-esque levels of awesomeness vis-a-vis capitalism? Or at least escape crippling poverty and break the cycle? I remain unconvinced.
If you asked Chua and Rubenfeld this question, they might respond that structural changes are indeed necessary and that good parenting alone is unlikely to reverse institutionalized racism and classism.
People forget that we’re not talking about Bill O’Reilly or Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh here. We’re talking about Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld—two wealthy, well-educated New England liberals who probably really want to say and believe the right things about humanity. 
But you should still be concerned about Chua and Rubenfeld.
Because even if we assume that their hearts are in the right place, the arguments they make in their book are too easily co-opted by folks who want to place responsibility (and the flip side of that coin—blame) solely on individuals rather than on society as a whole. The O’Reillys and the Becks and the Limbaughs of this world are going to use these arguments—issued by two professors at Yale Law School, no less—as ammunition, whether you like it or not. As responsible citizens, we should be concerned about this.
In her talk at the Harvard Book Store, Chua related a classic social experiment about impulse control—the Stanford marshmallow experiment, done back in the 60s. Little five-year-old kids were given a marshmallow and told that they could take the marshmallow now or wait 15 minutes and receive a second marshmallow. The experimenters followed these kids and the ones with stronger impulse control ended up being more successful 20 to 30 years later.
In a variation of this experiment, dubbed “the reverse marshmallow experiment,” some of the children were lied to and not given the second marshmallow after 15 minutes. In repeat studies, these children immediately pounced on the first marshmallow. It was a poignant commentary on how people who feel betrayed by their society might internalize counterproductive behaviors. 
It suggests that no culture exists in a vacuum, but that most traits regarded as “cultural” are more likely just learned responses to the way things are. Culture is about waiting for the second marshmallow. Structure is about making sure it gets there.
Chua and Rubenfeld are urging people to wait for that second marshmallow, which is all well and good if our society does indeed deliver after 15 minutes, or 15 years, or even 15 generations. And that’s where I’m not so sure.

EdX announced Monday that it has appointed Wendy Cebula, the former chief operating officer of VistaPrint, as its president and chief operating officer to help lead the non-profit online education platform as it expands and attempts to become financially self-supporting.
The same day, Coursera, a for-profit online education company, which competes with edX, announced that former Yale University President Richard C. Levin would become its new chief executive officer.
For edX, the decision to hire Cebula and modify its top leadership structure aims to accommodate a growing number of both users and partners, edX CEO Anant Agarwal said in a phone interview Monday afternoon.
“In order to be able to manage our growth and to continue to execute effectively on our mission, we felt it was important to bring in more bandwidth into our executive team,” Agarwal said. “Wendy will be responsible for the internal execution of the goals and mission of edX, while I’m going to be focusing a lot more on strategy, external partnerships, and our growth.”
Cebula, who worked for VistaPrint for 13 years, helped scale the online provider of marketing materials from a $1 million-dollar-a-year company to a $1-billion-dollar-a-year company in terms of global revenue, according to a press release from edX.
“Innovation in education shows no signs of slowing, and I’m excited to be a part of this movement and part of an organization that is literally changing the face of education for whole nations, businesses, universities and millions of learners around the world,” Cebula said in the press release.
As the platform continues to grow, Agarwal said that it will look to bolster its entrepreneurial spirit.
“We are a non-profit, but we also want to be self-sustaining within a few years, so that we don’t have to continue relying on philanthropy forever,” he said, referencing the $30 million funding contribution by Harvard and MIT in May 2012.
Still, Agarwal maintains that even as it develops new strategies for generating revenue, edX plans to stay committed to its goal of provided widely accessible online education in contrast to its for-profit counterparts.
“The difference is largely in the motive,” he said. “In terms of execution, in terms of what you do on a daily basis, all that stays the same. I don’t see a difference between a startup and a non-profit company like edX.”
Ray Schroeder, the associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield and an expert on online education, offered a similar reading of edX’s outlook.
“I don’t look at this as a shift in the inherent nature of edX,” Schroeder said. “It’s still learning. It’s still higher ed. But it adds an entrepreneurial aspect that I think has been missing in edX. The commercial opportunities to take this to large audiences is just huge.”
At the same time as edX is introducing an entrepreneur into its predominantly academic leadership staff, Schroeder said that Coursera, a Silicon Valley startup that has raised millions of dollars in venture capital since its 2012 launch, has embraced academic leadership in its decision to hire the former president of Yale University.
“It’s fascinating that on the same day, both edX and Coursera brought in top leadership, and particularly, for Coursera, bringing in a top academic administrator to augment their team, I think, was a very savvy move,” Schroeder said.

As many of the roughly 1,900 students at Harvard Law School stream out of morning classes, they are faced with more options than most. This Wednesday, the lunch menu at the Law School includes a book event, three guest speakers, five club meetings, and a clinic talk.
According to Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove, approximately 5,000 events take place at the Law School each year.
Nearly ten years ago, the Law School tried to address claims that there were too many events with too few attendees by rescheduling all classes that met between noon to 1:00 p.m. According to Cosgrove, who was consulted regarding the schedule rearrangement, the change aimed to give students another block of time to attend speaking events and club meetings while taking their lunch with them.
“Before [the change], students had to schedule most things for the evening,” Cosgrove wrote in an email. “That doesn’t work as well for students with partners and children and clinic or journal obligations, which can require solid blocks of uninterrupted time."
However, Cosgrove wrote that she believes that that there are more events at the Law School than before due to increased funding for student organizations and greater support of organizations and journals by firms.
"I haven't heard any observations that attendance has changed," she wrote.
Yet, it is unclear whether students consistently use the scheduled time to attend events.
According to first year law student Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, the time period allows her to attend interesting events that catch her eye.
“I’ve gone to things that I wouldn’t have gone to...because they’re so accessible,” Johnson said.
Still, some have questioned whether students appreciate the hour for events or merely use it as a chance to catch up on the heavy reading loads of law school courses.
“If I finish my readings, I generally go to something,” Johnson said, estimating that she spends one third of her lunches at events.
With so many events on campus every day, most students do not spend every lunch period at events and attendance dwindles toward the end of the semester as finals draw students away from club meetings and into the library, according to second year law student Shane A. Hunt.
“I try to go to at least one event a week,” Hunt said. “I’m not going five days a week—I don’t think anyone does.”
Others have focused on events that directly relate to their interests, according to Stefan A. Blunschi, who is pursuing a master's degree in law and estimated that he attends an event every other week during lunch.
“The general sense here is that students are attracted to Harvard Law School because there is an embarrassment of riches,” Cosgrove wrote. “Students are encouraged to pick and choose in a way that optimizes their educational path.”
With so many events on campus and no one wanting to limit the options, many student groups have focused on coordinating events with other clubs to avoid duplicating and overlapping one another, according to Hunt.
Rather than calling the 5,000 events that occur each year too much, most organizers have accepted the challenge of publicizing events so that they are well-attended.
“What’s the alternative?” Hunt said. “It looks really bad to bring in a high-profile guest and have no one show up, but that’s one of the risks you run.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a meeting Monday with Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, top Undergraduate Council leaders said that their request for a 50 percent increase in funding for student activities this year from the University was denied, even as Smith voiced support for their efforts and discussed funding possibilities for the future.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 insisted that Smith’s decision was not a setback, saying that they will work with the Office of Student Life and relevant administrators to gather data requested by Smith, as well as reach out to possible alumni and corporate sponsors.
“According to Dean Smith, we won’t see a dime from the University this year,” Mayopoulos said. He added that Smith “was very receptive to the fact that there was not sufficient funding [for student activities],” but “was very clear that Harvard cannot financially afford to support student co-curricular activities at this time.”
Goffard and Mayopoulos first detailed plans in February to request an additional $250,000 in funding for the UC, a figure and an initiative that have since become one of the most recognizable pushes by their administration. The pair met with University President Drew G. Faust later that month to discuss ways to raise the Council’s current annual budget of about $500,000 and were directed to speak with Smith.
Mayopoulos and Goffard said that Smith spoke “honest[ly]” on Monday about FAS budget restraints and what they described to be the University’s financial transparency problems. The dean also suggested that both the UC and the administration need to do a better job “getting their houses in order,” according to Goffard.
Mayopoulos spoke about “a lot of confusion” that exists in knowing the amount of University resources currently allocated to certain student activities or departments, such as the Athletic Department or the Phillips Brooks House Association. He added that Smith expressed desire for the UC to gather more data about exact sources and amounts of funding distributed to various departments that support student extracurriculars.
The UC has been vocal to point out that the only funding it receives is through an annual fee on undergraduate term bills that has not increased since 2006, despite rapid growth in the number of student groups.
Goffard said that although Smith’s response was reasonable, it “doesn’t make sense” that the University is not able to fund the UC.
Goffard said the University is “turning a blind eye” to the fact that certain clubs have to ask large dues from their members, while Mayopoulos said that it is “disrespectful” to undergraduates and against Harvard’s values that they not be ensuring every student, regardless of socioeconomic status, “has the opportunity to pursue the extra curriculars that they want to do.”
Although they said Smith was more receptive to a possible term bill increase, the UC leaders said they will continue to refuse to advocate for raising the fee unless the University agrees to offset some of the costs.
Mayopoulos and Goffard said they also discussed with Smith the possibility of acquiring funds through the capital campaign, which has raised $3.7 billion to date.
Mayopoulos said that he was told the money was “not available for present use” and will not be used “anytime in the near future” for the UC budget.
For Goffard and Mayopoulos, however, their goals going forward will remain unchanged. They said they will collaborate with a “working group” of deans from the Office of Student Life, whom they say support their budget goals, as well as College officials to acquire the data Smith wants.
In addition, the pair said they will consider more seriously seeking donations from alumni and corporate sponsors, and are willing “to do whatever it takes.”
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that Dean Smith “enjoyed” meeting with UC leaders, and  “like many faculty, students and administrators across Harvard, he and they are all working to improve the undergraduate student experience.”

Undergraduate Council representatives, in collaboration with the Graduate Student Council, endorsed capping the size of “every graded section or lab group” at 12 students and helping to make the limit a College policy at the UC’s meeting Monday evening.
“Endorsing this piece of legislation is historic,” UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal '16 said. “It’s one of the biggest issues initiatives that the UC has ever taken on…. This is something that will revolutionize teaching here at Harvard.”
GSC President Summer A. Shafer, along with various graduate school teaching fellows from the Harvard Teaching Campaign, spoke before the Council at its general meeting Monday about the harms of large section sizes. The Campaign is a recently formed group of teaching fellows and various other instructors seeking to improve “the educational experience of undergraduates,” according to the group’s website.
Representatives from the Campaign and the GSC said at the meeting that since the economic recession, undergraduates have faced the consequences of larger section sizes.
“We believe that since budget cuts in 2008, our ability to teach the best students in the world has been compromised by unreasonably large section sizes,” Shafer said.
Since late February, graduate students have been expressing discontent with large section sizes, which they say inconvenience students and confine TFs and students to limited classroom space and feedback from instructors. Earlier this spring, the Philosophy department endorsed students' efforts to limit the section size to 12.
Goyal said that he and Shafer met earlier this year with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and have spoken to senior faculty members of the Committee on Undergraduate Education about their goals, but were told they needed data to show that “smaller is better.”
In its endorsement, the UC agreed to raise “awareness on campus about this issue and [gather] data through its means of campus wide communication.”
Although Goyal said he is “extremely excited” about the proposal and emphasized the influence Harvard would have in spreading a message to institutions worldwide, not every member of the UC voted in support of the measure.
Many initially voiced concerns about how the University would fund additional instructors and whether there was concrete data on what the average section size at Harvard is.
Lowell House Representative Karim Pirbay ’16, however, was the only member of the Council to vote no in the official tally. In an interview after the meeting, Pirbay said he disagreed with the idea that students are being harmed by larger sections.
“I think that more people in the classroom means more ideas in the classroom and therefore more substance to draw substance from,” Pirbay said.
In addition to passing education legislation, the UC’s meeting also included a review of the results of an internal survey.
While members rated the overall “Q guide” score of the Council at an average of 3.79 out of 5, only a quarter rated their weekly committee meetings at the highest level of productivity. 27 out of 28 representatives gave Mayopoulos and Goffard a performance rating of a 4 or 5.
The UC also approved a new round of spring grants, which allocated about $7,800 to various large-venue events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


Herbert “Herbie” J. Hancock, the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry, discussed how his Buddhist beliefs have fueled his musical creativity in a lecture at Sanders Theatre Monday afternoon.
At the lecture, entitled “Buddhism and Creativity,” Hancock first shared his story of adopting Buddhism and then discussed the relationship between religious worldviews and artistic innovation. The lecture was the penultimate installment of the semester-long, six-part Norton lecture series entitled “The Ethics of Jazz” and presented by the Mahindra Humanities Center.
Hancock said that he was first introduced to Buddhism by Buster Williams, a member of his band, at a gig in Seattle in 1972. Since then, he has been practicing Buddhism, which he says “has affected how I look at everything.” He said he believes that practicing Buddhism has “profoundly transformed and enhanced [his] life, both as a human and as a musician.”
Hancock described the practice of Buddhist principles as a condition of being awakened, and said that the exercise of these beliefs “reveals a major shift in the relationship between yourself and your external environment.”
He added that this new way of life and the Buddhist chants that he has since embraced unleashed a great inspiration for his creativity.
Hancock outlined what he believes are the fundamental characteristics of cultural artistic creativity: inspiration, hard work, challenge, courage, originality and innovation, ability or skill, and imagination. Yet he said that the true definition of creativity transcends words, and for this reason, creativity is like magic.
Hancock then asked the question, “So, well, what motivates creativity?”  He continued to list the several main motivators, including fear, pain and suffering, joy, the time clock, stress, anger, desire, humor, and observation.
He argued that everyone has the capability to be a creative artistic individual, especially since everyone is involved in “the art of living.”
He specifically discussed the power of Buddhism to influence creativity, saying that the belief system “modifies our state of being, and expands our creativity.”
Hancock wrapped up the lecture by declaring that even amid difficult circumstances, “a person that lives with imagination, hard work, innovation, along with integrity, wisdom and compassion...can be a profound contributor toward the creation of a harmonious orchestra of life,” even though the “art of living is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most difficult to master.”
Audience members, many of whom had attended Hancock’s previous lectures, said that they enjoyed learning about what has inspired the jazz musician.
Cambridge resident and painter Eve Perkins said that she appreciates that Hancock’s teachings can be translated into other disciplines.
Bradford G. Rose ’14, a drummer and manager for Harvard Jazz Bands, said he attended the lecture because he believes it is “important to learn an artist’s source of inspiration–it adds some color.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: March 26, 2014, at 2:44 a.m.
In an effort to promote educational exploration and better organize online advising resources for students, the Advising Programs Office plans to replace its current website with a new, “twenty-first century” platform for the 2014-'15 academic year. 
The APO hopes to make the website more user-friendly by aggregating all the essential advising information into one site and increasing its visibility, according to Director of Advising Programs Glenn R. Magid.
“For the most part, [the Advising website] is just a store of links,” Magid said. “There is very little content on the site other than what points you to other sites. It may be difficult for a new user coming to the site, unless they already know what they are looking for.”
 
Discussions about launching a new website have been circulating throughout the office for a number of years, Magid said. But it was only last summer, after the APO discontinued their “48 Book”—a printed guide on concentrations for freshmen and first-semester sophomores—that the office began planning to create a new site. Their first initiative was to migrate all the information from the 48 Book to a web page.
 
According to Magid, the site, which will use the Harvard-based platform OpenScholar, is currently a “skeleton” structure with little content. To fill in the missing information, the APO has asked Harvard staff such as those from the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships to assist or control the creation of content for the site.
 
Additionally, the APO has commissioned a student advisory board to offer feedback about advising programs at Harvard. According to Adam N. Ratajczak ’15, a member of the board, the committee has recently focused on providing student perspective on the creation of this new website.
 
“There is currently a ton of information [on the site], but an overload of information, which renders it almost useless,” Ratajczak said.
 
H. Claire Edelson ’15, another member of the board, said that she hopes the new website will encourage students to take full advantage of Harvard’s academic and advising resources.
“I think the main issue is that the current site is really hard to navigate, it’s kind of unclear and disorganized,” she said. “ As a student you approach it and think, ‘Harvard has so many resources,’ but you can't figure out how to access them.”
 
Yet according to some students, the APO’s new website does not yet have the visibility it needs to engage students in educational exploration.
 
“I would advertise its existence a little bit more,” Caroline K. Lauer ’14 said.  “Not too many people know about it.”
 
Magid said the APO has acknowledged this issue and hopes to encourage students to visit the website.
 
“We’re trying to address broadly information seekers and explorers, who may be one and the same person,” he said. “We want people to come back.” 
The development of the APO’s new website runs in tandem with other efforts to increase the efficiency and usability of Harvard’s online resources. By the 2016-17 academic year, the University also plans to replace the current iSites web interface with Canvas, a platform designed to add flexibility to course websites.

Wendy S. Kopp, CEO and founder of Teach For America, discussed the lasting importance of the organization in recruiting the top students to promote education at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday.
Kopp first answered questions from Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 and then opened the discussion to audience questions.
Kopp addressed concerns about her program’s recruitment methods. She said that in order to attract the best talent, TFA must continue to follow the recruitment techniques of the investment banks and consulting firms that attract graduating students.
“We realized that in addition to the marketing stuff and the positioning of Teach For America, we were going to have to do the same kind of relationship-building that they did and form this approach of identifying the top prospects,” she said.
Kopp said this recruitment method helped attract people that may have otherwise directed their talent elsewhere. She argued that the major problem facing the American educational system is that top prospects tend to find careers in finance, law, or medicine.
TFA has been able to compete with those industries for top graduates recently due in large part to its decision to use similar recruiting tactics to those industries, Kopp said.
“It’s why we have attained the level of not only the numbers but the caliber and diversity of the folks that come and Teach for America,” Kopp said.
Around 50 to 70 percent of TFA alumni continue careers in education, either teaching or promoting educational concerns, she added.
Despite TFA’s success in recruiting top students, some audience members questioned the rapid growth of the program and the effectiveness of its teachers.
The number of TFA corps members has doubled since 2007 and the organization’s operating budget has nearly tripled in the same time period.
Kopp expressed pride in the program’s recent growth, but admitted it has come with challenges. Instilling the core values of the organization is now more important and more challenging, she said.
“There are consequences to the pace of growth we pursued. In hindsight, I would have done that slightly differently,” she said. “You just cannot maintain the kind of culture with this pace of growth.”
 
Still, Kopp said that the audience should look at the success of TFA in perspective. She cited evidence from Oakland, Calif., where almost all of the schools were failing 25 years ago, though most of them are now on an upward trajectory largely because of TFA’s presence in the area.
 
She said this pattern has been occurring across the country and hopes that the progress continues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
In the second weekend of a 12-game stint in sunny California, the Harvard softball team went 2-3 at the Cal State Northridge tournament.
 
The Crimson struggled to score runs at first, losing the first three contests and never scoring more than two runs in any game. But on the last day of the tournament, the squad finally clicked offensively, heading into Ivy League play on a two-game winning streak.
HARVARD 7, UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC 1
In its final matchup of the tournament, the Crimson avenged the previous day’s 4-2 loss to the Tigers. After getting out to an early two-run lead, the Harvard offense exploded in the top of the fifth inning for five runs and never looked back.
The upperclassmen showed up offensively, putting the team on their backs and contributing to seven runs. Captains Kasey Lange and Shelbi Olson, and junior Katherine Lantz each had two hits, including a three-run home run in the fifth by Lantz.
Freshman pitcher Taylor Cabe pitched a complete game to improve to 3-6 on the season, giving up only one run on four hits. The win was her first of the road trip.
HARVARD 8, CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD 2
In the first game Saturday, the Crimson also showed up to beat a Cal State Bakersfield team to which it had lost the day before. After falling behind 1-0 in the first inning, Lange launched a two-run homer to right field to give Harvard a lead that it would never relinquish.
Lange, the all-time long ball record holder for Harvard, had two goners on the day, also stepping into another two-run shot in the sixth. Both times, she drove in her co-captain Olson.
Junior Laura Ricciardone pitched six strong to earn the win, moving to 5-5 on the season, before handing off the ball to Cabe, who held Bakersfield in the last frame.
“The last day in California, our team really figured out what we were struggling with and came out with two solid wins,” said Ricciardone.
CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD 2, HARVARD 1 (8 INNINGS)
In the second game on Friday, the Crimson continued to struggle offensively, putting up one run in the extra-inning loss to Cal State Bakersfield. It was the defense, however, that ultimately did the team in, as the game ended when a Roadrunner scored on a Harvard error.
Sophomore Morgan Groom saw her first action of the tournament, pitching four innings and giving up only one run on three hits. She was relieved by Cabe, who pitched the final three innings and change. Cabe picked up the loss on that error after holding Bakersfield for the first three innings.
Freshman Jillian Leslie drove in the only run of the game for the Crimson when she singled with the bases loaded and drove in Olson.
UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC 4, HARVARD 2
The long ball doomed the Crimson in the first game Friday. Ricciardone tossed a complete game, but picked up the loss, giving up four earned runs on twin two-run shots by Tiger slugger Bailey O’Mara in the first and sixth innings.
After falling behind by two runs in the first, Leslie was able to drive in a run on a single up the middle. Then, as she stole second, the Crimson were able to capitalize on a throwing error and tie the game.
But the squad was shut down for the rest of the game. O’Mara’s second jack in the sixth gave Pacific the lead for good.
CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 4, HARVARD 1
The Crimson took the field against host team Northridge in its first game of the weekend, but was unable to pull off the win against a strong squad.
Cabe took the mound and struggled early, giving up two runs in the bottom frame of the first inning when Taylor Glover of Northridge tripled to the gap in left center field and proceeded to score on a sacrifice fly.
Junior Emily Gusse smashed a solo home run in the top of the fourth to bring the Crimson within one, but the Matadors responded with two runs in the bottom of the fourth, a gap which the Crimson could not overcome.
“I think after those three games we were at a bottom point,” said Groom. “Our coach talked about us getting that killer instinct…. Even though we lost those first three games, I think we are at a good spot heading into Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard men’s basketball team shocked the hoops world by beating No. 3 seed New Mexico in the second round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament, the team was quickly brought back to reality, losing to No. 6 seed Arizona by 23 points two days later.
At that point, there were many questions to answer.
What would next year’s expectations be, as the team reintegrated senior Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry? Would the Crimson be able to win the Ivy League and get another chance to play bracket-buster?
Perhaps no player answered more of these questions than junior wing Wesley Saunders, who helped the team duplicate last season’s NCAA success by dispatching No. 5 seed Cincinnati last Thursday, and then losing a close-fought battle against No. 4 seed Michigan State on Saturday night.
Saunders looks at least year’s victory over the Lobos as a turning point for the Crimson program, which has risen from being overlooked to being a force to be reckoned with on a national stage.
“Ever since that win, every time we stepped on the court we have had to bring our A game because everybody’s giving us their best shot because of what we were able to do in the [2013] tournament,” said Saunders at Wednesday’s media availability. “So I think it kind of just put a little bit of a target on our back. But I think that we have been able to step up to the challenge and embrace it.”
The 2013-2014 Ivy League Player of the Year was a key component in Harvard’s efforts once again, leading the team in scoring against both Cincinnati and Michigan State.
Saunders’ 22 points on Saturday led to his entrance into the 1,000-point club at Harvard and almost resulted in an upset of a Michigan State team that many pundits have picked to make it to Dallas for the Final Four. The junior finished the season with 1,012 career points.
Saunders’ offensive efforts in the tournament have proven to be no fluke. The swingman reached double-digit scoring for the 21st game during his junior season against Michigan State, and the 52nd time in his career.
While the wing was expected to perform well this season after leading the Ivy League in points per game last year with an average of 17.1, his expertise isn’t limited to his scoring capabilities.
When the Crimson found out it would face Cincinnati in its opening tournament appearance this year, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker turned to Saunders to stop Cincinnati co-captain Sean Kilpatrick, who averaged 20.6 points per game.
“[Saunders has] been, in my opinion, the best all-around player in our conference and one of the better ones in the country, and he doesn’t get enough credit for what he does on the defensive end of the floor,” said Amaker after Thursday’s game. “Wesley has got to guard those guys for us. That’s lot to ask of him, but he’s capable and I think he’s shown that he’s up to the task for doing that. He’s done it for us all season.”
His teammates expected the same from Saunders, who made a further mark in the box score by leading the team in steals this season.
“Our game plan was to put our best defender on [Kilpatrick], Wesley Saunders,” sophomore Siyani Chambers said. “He’s done it for us all year. And he was able to do it again tonight, I thought.”
Entering Saturday’s contest opposite Michigan State, Saunders was prepared to repeat his defensive prowess against potential first-round NBA selection Gary Harris.
“[I’m planning to] just come out and play hard,” said Saunders at Friday’s media availability. “It’s going to be another great challenge, and I’m looking forward to it. We just try to stick to our standards and principles and do the things that have gotten us to this point.”
Despite the early deficit the Crimson experienced in Saturday’s game—in which Michigan State scored nine of the game’s first 11 points—Saunders aided the team’s comeback efforts, taking advantage of any transition opportunities.
“We thought if we could get up the court and try to score some things before they got set up, it would be beneficial for us,” Saunders said. “We just were able to knock down some shots, and we were able to lock in on defense a little bit to chip away at the lead.”
While Amaker recognized the talent of Michigan State after Saturday’s game, he was sure to acknowledge the performance of the players sitting by his side during the post game interview, including Saunders.
“I can’t say enough about our team and the effort and the guts that they showed in the second half to make a run, to take the lead, to play with so much composure and poise and fight,” Amaker said. “I’m proud of our program, proud of our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing a barrage of three-pointers in its first-round WNIT win over Iona, the Harvard women’s basketball team (22-8, 11-3 Ivy) fell, 63-52, to a Rutgers squad (24-9, 12-6 American Athletic) that launched all 61 of its shots from inside the arc in the WNIT second round matchup at the Rutgers Athletic Center in Piscataway, New Jersey.
Sophomore guard Kahleah Copper led the inside attack for the Scarlet Knights, finishing with 19 points and 12 rebounds. Copper hit seven of her 16 shots from the field and also went 5-for-9 from the foul line.
Copper was not the only Scarlet Knight to make her way to the charity stripe, as the team’s attacking style of play earned it 24 trips to the line on the night. The Crimson only attempted nine free throws on the evening.
In contrast to Rutgers, Harvard launched the ball from deep 21 times on the evening, but the Crimson only hit seven triples on the night for a 33 percent clip, below its season average. Two of the treys came in the final minutes when the game was already all but decided.
While the contrasting styles of offensive play was noticeable throughout the game, the difference in the game came down to the turnover battle. With both teams shooting below 40 percent from the field, it was Harvard’s 20 turnovers to Rutgers’ eight that doomed the Crimson.
The Scarlet Knights defense, especially on the perimeter, hounded the Crimson guards all night.
This physical man-to-man defense was led by junior guard Syessence Davis, who was able to bottle up Harvard captain Christine Clark for much of the night on her way to a four steal, eight assist effort.
“They are an incredibly athletic team, and we knew they were going to be physical coming in,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We knew we were going to have to use our teamwork and fundamentals, and I think we did that.”
Just as Davis was able to hold Clark, the catalyst of the Crimson’s offense, to 11 points on the night, solid interior defense from sophomore forward Rachel Hollivay helped limit the effectiveness of junior forward Temi Fagbenle. The team’s second-leading scorer on the season ended up with just four points on nine shots.
Fagbenle finished the first half scoreless after getting into early foul trouble, but it wasn’t just her offensive output that was affected.
Rutgers was able to build its early six-point halftime lead while Fagbenle sat with two fouls.
“Jasmine, Christine, and Temi each got two fouls in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t know if that threw us off or what [happened]. We got the shots that we wanted, but they just didn’t fall.”
With Clark and Fagbenle struggling to score against the physical Scarlet Knight defense, senior Jasmine Evans stepped up for the Crimson offense, scoring 15 points on 6-10 shooting from the field.
“I think [Jasmine] stepped up in a really big way tonight,” junior Ali Curtis said. “She has always been a really important player for our team, both on the offensive and defensive end. I think she did a really good job of handling the pressure they were throwing at us, and that she was very influential tonight."
Even with its offensive struggles on the night, Harvard was able to hang around thanks to some tough defense of its own. The Crimson appeared to know the book on Rutgers’ offense and its lack of outside shooting, as it repeatedly packed the paint against the Scarlet Knights in hopes of forcing long two-point jumpers.
“Our defensive plan throughout the game was to stop their drives,” Curtis said. “We knew they were an athletic team that wanted to drive, so we really packed it in and tried to take away their strengths.”
While the strategy was able to force plenty of these less efficient shots, the Crimson couldn’t capitalize on Rutgers’ poor shooting.
Harvard fell behind to open the contest, and never led by more than one the entire game.
The loss marks the third straight year that the Crimson have fallen in the second round of the WNIT, while the 22 wins for Harvard on the year are the most for the team since the 2002-03 season.
“All in all, I thought we played pretty well,” Delaney-Smith said. “I was amazed at how well we handled the game they threw at us, but the ball didn’t fall for us. I thought we were able to get the shots we wanted against their athleticism, [but] they just didn’t fall.”

UPDATED: July 30, 2014 at 2:55 p.m.
We met in the Herbarium, a large building at the end of Divinity Ave. that was once the Divinity School Library. Dean Pfister told me he wanted to meet in the space where he had spent his entire career. “My whole life at Harvard has been in this building, so it’s a place to reflect on how I got into studying fungi, and why I’ve done what I’ve done.”
Pfister spent his childhood amidst the beauty of plants, and loved the outdoors from a young age. “I grew up in a rural town in Ohio and my grandparents had a farm. So I was always attracted to being outside and tuned into gardening and plants; how they grow and what you can do with them.”
He first encountered fungi while exploring his grandparents’ farm. “Before I knew anything about fungi, I knew something about plant disease, by observing what was happening in the field. In some ways, I had a very free-ranging childhood: we were given freedom in ways kids these days aren’t.”
Grade school was never a highlight for Pfister. As we talked about it, he smiled, remembering “a lot of clumsiness” during years when schoolwork seemed purposeless. But that changed when he was an undergraduate botany major at Miami University in Ohio, and a professor introduced him to fungi.
One memory in particular comes to mind when he reflects on his growing interest in fungi during his college years. The Miami University campus has rural fringes. “One period in the spring, I had gone out. I went about along the trails, and found this absolutely beautiful large, red cup fungi. I was so excited and thought, ‘This is just wonderful! Nobody has ever seen anything quite like this ever before.’ So I took it back to my professor. He got out a field book, flipped to a page and there it was.”
Seeing the fungi he was holding on the page of that book sparked something in Dean Pfister. “It was kind of a combination of two thoughts. One was, ‘Isn’t it amazing? Isn’t this fungus really beautiful and fantastic?’ And the other part was, ‘Oh, somebody’s already figured this out. This isn’t unknown, it’s known.’” But there was so much to be discovered in the world of fungi: “I got hooked on this idea of the unknown.” Pfister continued studying this little-known organism as a graduate student at Cornell, and then as a botanist doing fieldwork in various parts of the world, from Patagonia to Iceland.
No matter where in the world Dean Pfister finds himself, there is something special about being out in the field. “To look at trees and think about them as architecture. All of nature is telling a story, and some of that is in the aesthetics. Some of it is the peace and quiet that you can find often in being out, and being away. And some of it is a sense of independence when you’re not tethered to a computer or a desk or a cell phone. You’re free in a different kind of way.”
Pfister believes that you can divide the world into the mushroom-lovers and the mushroom-haters. Mycophilic, mushroom-loving societies feel comfortable eating and collecting mushrooms, which leads to “a very different relationship than mycrophobic societies, where people are afraid of the mushrooms. They teach their kids to kick them over, and think, ‘Don’t touch it, because it might be poisonous.’”
In our mycophobic society, where some of us tend to regard fungus as just mold on bread, Pfister emerged as one of the mycophilic. Talking to him, it is clear that he is in such genuine awe of the beauty of nature, and the mystery of an organism we know so little about. He’s loves what he does, and cares about his work in a way that I really hope to one day. And with his years of fungi work, he has spread his wisdom to the College’s student body, whether it was reminding us why we had Yale beat before The Game had begun, or prompting us to look up into the trees to admire little wonders in the Yard.
When July 1st rolls around, we will all miss having him as our Dean. But Pfister will be able to return to the Herbarium, a place he calls his home at Harvard, where he can continue to study the mysterious, wonderful world of fungi.

So naturally all that’s left for us to do is bite our nails, pull our hair, and constantly scroll through the OCS website worrying about summer plans. Since the start of this year, I’ve been polishing my resume, tweaking my cover letter template, and applying to more internships than I can remember. And yet, it’s almost the start of April and I have not yet received a single congratulatory email. Instead, all I have to relish are automated responses thanking me for applying.
 So fellow Harvardians, what did I do? Of course, I quickly (but briefly) went into existential-crisis mode, questioning my choices and future and misreading arbitrary events as signs that my life was falling apart, all eventually leading to a teary phone conversation with my mother who soothed me the way only mothers know how. It goes without saying that to a collegiate, “Summer” holds the most valuable possession: time. Time to do whatever you want—time to make a difference, to save starving children, to create a start-up, to expand that resume.
What I realized after all of my panic was that though I didn’t have an all-expense paid trip to South Africa or wasn’t enrolled to take classes in Spain, my lack of plans can be taken as my freedom to plan. I’m sure many of you reading this will chastise me for my optimism, but sometimes you’ve just got to make the best of a crummy situation.
WerkMake some cash. Getting a job over the summer is never a bad idea—whether it’s in retail, at a law firm, babysitting, etc. working can help you save up money you might need for next summer. Working for someone can be a humbling and educational experience (oh experience, that little thing we all need but never have enough of). It’ll force you to sign out of Netflix, get off of your bed, and actually be productive.
Do that thing you said you would doYou know that thing? The thing you never had time to do but said you’d always do when you did have time? Guess what—you have that time and that time is now. Whether it’s starting a novel, learning to play piano, building a birdhouse, whatever floats your boat, you finally have no excuses not to do it. Create! Make! Do!
VolunteerFor those of us with bigger hearts and better morals, public service is an option to make yourself look and feel good. It’s hard to say no to legal unpaid labor, so there are tons of opportunities ranging from local to international ones. Many organizations, like the PBHA Summer Urban Program, are still accepting applications, so it’s not too late to start looking now.
ShadowAt Harvard we have access to a rich pool of alumni. If you’re hoping to move forward in your career, it can be helpful to contact alums working in your field of interest and asking to shadow them. This way you can get a better idea of what you want to do in life, which is all we want isn’t it?
Enjoy yourselfI always feel that in the rush and anxiety of making summer plans, we often forget that it is a vacation. Harvard life is stressful, so decompress with summer life. There will be sun and warmth—two things that have become foreign to us frozen dwellers. Take it in, cherish it, and let it bring you some peace of mind.
If this post, written by a somewhat clueless freshman, doesn’t help you, and you stick your nose up to such tomfoolery, you can always seek professional help. Visit the Office of Career Services or talk to a proctor about what you can do. Summer still isn’t here yet—you still have a bajillion more midterms and finals, so chill. There is still time, no matter how limited.
