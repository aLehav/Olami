Premiering on Fox this fall, ‘The Cool Kids’ ultimately falls short of a quality pilot, lacking an interesting plot and consistently clever comedy. Opening on what looks like a poorly edited stock photo of a retirement home, the inside is revealed to be a lackluster and underwhelming set where mediocrity takes center stage.
The show centers on three friends, Hank (David Alan Grier), Sid (Leslie Jordan), and Charlie (Martin Mull), living in the Shady Meadows retirement home. Following the death of their close friend Jerry, the trio are troubled by the addition of Margaret (Vicki Lawrence) when she unceremoniously sits down at their table. The rest of the episode deals with the group trying to put together a sufficient memorial service for Jerry, including using Jerry’s credit card to buy beer and getting pulled over in a stolen car. The most noticeable theme is the slow assimilation of Margaret into the “Cool Kids” friend group, which does not happen without significant pushback from the guys, especially Hank.
At its core, the show ages the high school clique cliché to a retirement home setting. In that vein — aside from the more mature joke material — the entire episode feels more like watching a Disney Channel show than an adult comedy. However, it fits well into the genre of teenage drama, with grown men acting like vindictive and catty children. Imagine a bad remake of “Mean Girls,” and then replace them with 70 year-old men with arthritis and bad eyesight. The comedic writing consists of lazy set-ups and predictable punch lines, often resorting to adult material for a cheap laugh rather than thoughtful humor, as in Margaret’s introductory line as she steals Hank’s flask: “Do you mind? It’s been a bitch of a morning.” Typical sitcom shenanigans are replaced with some really unsettling activities, such as the gang taking a stolen car in a pathetic attempt to rescue their friend’s (dead) body from the funeral home before he’s cremated. (“They probably poppin’ Jerry in the oven as we speak.”)
With the most memorable moment being a quick cameo of executive producer Charlie Day as an inept repairman, the only quality humor in the episode are some one-liners that evoke more cringing than laughter. At one point, Sid, representing a token gay character, tries to flirt with Margaret. While the set-up has promise, it is poorly written and executed. Another unfortunate joke: When Hank is blowing off smoke about the way Margaret behaved in her introductory scene, and quips that a woman never would have talked to him like that in the ’50s, Charlie comments “You wouldn’t have been allowed in the restaurant in the ’50s!” This back and forth treats the blatantly racist and misogynistic material very poorly, missing the mark with some groan-inducing attempts at humor.
Behind all of the ineffective humor and laugh tracks is the sad truth of the show’s premise: It’s just plain depressing. It’s a group of aging friends attempting to relive their golden years while the reality of their impending mortality looms in every scene. Every old age joke or stunt (of which there are plenty) just reminds the audience of the pathetic environment in which the show exists that no laugh track can obscure. Take for example, when the group gets pulled over in a car stolen from another retirement home resident. Hank’s advice is to “Relax, pretend we have Alzheimer's.”
The ending carries on sitcom clichés with new member, Margaret, gaining the respect and gratitude of the previously cold friend group. The conclusion is predictable and produces little joy or enthusiasm for the audience to absorb. At best, audiences will come out apathetic and bored; at worst, dejected. Even with all of the characters’ shortcomings, it may not necessarily be the actors’ fault. It is unfortunate that the audience can’t see what this cast might be capable of, as any comedic talents they might bring are obscured by subpar writing. It’s among the dozen shows that will come out this fall with zero creativity or originality and a shelf-life of a season or less. “The Cool Kids” is a member of the group of network comedies that appear every television debut season with no prospects, the product of of lazy writing and uninspired production.

Say what you will against sappy happy endings, but countless fictions have been spun for a reason: to satisfy a human need for imaginative romantic spectacle. In distilling the electric connections forged on subway platforms, in bookstores, and on planes into thrilling and syrupy sagas, romantic comedies serve up polished and less embarrassing versions of our own fantasies. Something about the hackneyed formula is inherently comforting: unbidden romantic feelings, untimely recognition of those feelings, operatic falling-outs — oftentimes on street curbs — and epic confessions of love. Happy endings by screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna ’89 are particularly satisfying in that they are both generous and understated. She has made a career of writing consistently heartwarming, women-centric comedies like “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006), “27 Dresses” (2008), and “Morning Glory” (2010). Her films amount to more than just simple retreads, as she both reprises and complicates beloved romantic comedy traditions through her clever dialogue and ambitious, uncompromising heroines.
In an interview with The Ringer, Brosh McKenna explained the motivation behind her gratifying endings, and how she seeks to resolve central non-romantic conflicts before throwing romantic fulfillment into the mix. “It would be like, trying to see if her life would work out…and a man, because there’s also a trope of leaving women in movies alone, just alone. I always wanted to show how those things can come together; they can inform each other. Figuring out your spiritual, personal journey can affect your romantic life and vice versa. But that’s not the endgame, because if we know anything of life, it’s not that you have that kiss and then everything’s perfect,” she said.
On the surface, “27 Dresses” might seem to promote misjudgments about women and their supposedly fatuous obsession with weddings. The hopeful romantic Jane (Katherine Heigl) does indeed marry her unexpected complement, the cynical, lovelorn journalist who betrays her trust (James Marsden), but the happy ending isn’t fantastically precipitated or defined only by their relationship arc. It is also contingent upon the self-reflection that Jane needs to break a routine of self-pity and quit her dead-end job. “I often had a lot of issues in development where I wanted to have a nontraditional ending to a romantic comedy. Like on ‘27 Dresses,’ I just did not want her to end up with anybody. I wanted her to end up becoming a more realized person,” Brosh McKenna said.
In her films, a fulfilling career is a woman’s lodestar. In “Morning Glory,” the energetic news producer Becky (Rachel McAdams) is unswervingly confident in her own abilities and in the future of the morning news show she is hired to revive. Her passion weathers defenses and inspires loyalty in those around her, even in the curmudgeonly news anchor (Harrison Ford) who grows to respect her creativity, later imparting wisdom he has gleaned from his own legendary career. In “The Devil Wears Prada,” as in “Morning Glory,” it is a precariously earned professional mentorship and not a romantic prospect that changes the female protagonist’s life. The brilliant and imperious magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) earns our fear and admiration when she delivers acerbic and now hallowed one-liners such as, “Find me that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning” and “Who is that sad little person?” Brosh McKenna’s 2011 film, “I Don’t Know How She Does It,” stars Sarah Jessica Parker, whose husband does much of the housework and the childrearing while she commutes between New York and Boston for work. She overworks herself and misses her son’s first haircut, but genuinely loves her job. In Brosh McKenna’s films, the camera doesn’t fixate pruriently on the woman herself, but instead romanticizes cityscapes, especially of New York, as if in salute to human enterprise. When Becky runs through Rockefeller Plaza under time pressure, the air practically crackles with possibility as she dashes by a gilded statue of Prometheus. It’s refreshing to see that Brosh McKenna’s young professional women throw themselves wholeheartedly into their work and later re-evaluate their lives thankfully not in grudging obligation to others, but in pursuit of personal happiness.
In 2015, Brosh McKenna took a different tack and co-created “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” with Rachel Bloom, who plays crazy ex-girlfriend Rebecca Bunch. Brosh McKenna explained her timely leap from feature films to television, citing the novelty-friendly and less sitcom-centric television landscape as conducive to her experimental project of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”: “There’s so much of girls tripping down stairs, saving kittens from windows and stuff in rom-coms to make them likable and protect them[...]Working on ‘Crazy Ex’ was the opposite of that,” she said. The show pointedly flies in the face of romantic comedy conventions, with funky original songs that are themselves send-ups of various artistic styles and genres. Instead of expressing Rebecca’s complicated mental state with dry expository dialogue, Bloom performs it. Some absurdist tunes could have you choking on your disbelieving laughter. Consider these lyrics from the “JAP [Jewish American Princess] Rap Battle” to get a better idea of Brosh McKenna’s punning prowess: “Our life lines have been parallel like corduroys / But now we’ll see whose bars will prevail / In this beef of two hard-as-nails Shebrews from Scarsdale!” In the black-and-white “Sexy French Depression,” Rebecca drawls, “Oi, je suis garbage” as she wallows melodramatically on a bathroom floor. It’s no wonder that Brosh McKenna’s playful wrangling with classic cultural heritage has rendered her own works veritable modern classics.

Per a fictive online review, stand-up comedian Nina Geld (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has been described as “funny,” “super smart,” but also — “hot”? People love the way she deprecates people, especially men, in her own spontaneous, raw brand of wit. While she’s on stage talking about her sex life — how little she cares about what men’s personalities are like, and more about how well they can fuck.
“All About Nina,” featured in the Boston Women’s Film Festival at Brattle Theater, is an emotional tour de force. Released in the wake of the #MeToo movement, it demands respect and admiration. It may be all about Nina, who auditions for a “Saturday Night Live”-esque comedy show, but its other characters, while somewhat caricatured, add more humor to the mix. They include Rafe (Common), Nina’s sexy, compassionate partner who has nonetheless made mistakes; Lake (Kate del Castillo), her spiritual, tarot-card-reading, horoscope type host; and Amy (Mindy Sterling), the overeager, doting, annoyingly insouciant friend of her mother.
Nina tells it like it is, and her audience finds it so funny and attractive how riled up she gets — she is quite the crowd pleaser. The world objectifies her as she criticizes the world for objectifying her, but this is her path to success. Her messages are important, but only to the people who already think they are: This is the reality for so many female comedians, and other women. Through seamlessly delivered jokes about cancer researchers who could have found the cure had they not been obsessed with their female lab assistants and other could-have-been-success stories about men, she conveys a message: You can try to sway sexist men for as long as you please, but in the end, they start the locker room talk about how much they want to fuck you. It’s a lost cause. Or is it?
When Lake tells Nina to “woman the fuck up” and tell Rafe, a man she truly likes, probably for the first time in her life, the “truth,” Lake doesn’t even know what the truth is. Director Eva Vives reminds us throughout the film that truths are rarely simple, whether that’s Nina’s (and Winstead’s) charming performances that end in her puking backstage, or Rafe and Nina coming out to each other about his dad walking out when he was a kid, or her father’s suicide. The truth Rafe doesn’t know is her IPV-strewn past relationship with a married cop with children that she never fully ends except by blocking his contact, as well as a traumatizing past.
In this film, the comedy’s most telling moments aren’t funny. As Rafe watches her perform, Nina tells the world her truth. At her first show, once she makes it to Comedy Prime, the next biggest thing in her stand-up career, this traumatic story comes out. In Winstead’s heart-wrenching bit, there is no aspect of comedy. It grips the crowd. No one claps. She goes viral. It makes one wonder how many other performers out there use performance to skim over their struggles, or how many women censor histories of sexual trauma just to keep themselves and their careers keeping on.
It’s impossible not to cry with Nina — I did for about 10 minutes. She becomes someone whom a teenage girl could easily revere: an independent woman who lives and breathes a career that is her passion, that she does so well.
There are other people like Nina around us — in that they are icons and for some awful reason, something traumatizing, some crime, or something uncomfortable had to happen to them while they were furthering their careers or as part of an enshrouded past. There is much to be angry about, like the way women are pitted against each other in the world of comedy. Or the fact that the old white man Larry Michaels (Beau Bridges) who is responsible for hiring Nina at Comedy Prime thinks that her now-powerful voice against abuse might stop the crowd from finding her funny — and that this is a valid reason to contemplate wounding her career, though he is “glad” she got it off her chest. Eva Vives shows us why all women and performers should feel comfortable putting their truths out there.
We don’t know what will happen to Nina, but “All About Nina” leaves no choice but for you to care.

Laura Steinel’s directorial debut “Family” features main character Kate (Taylor Schilling), an awkward workaholic who is stuck caring for her 11-year-old niece, Maddie (Bryn Vale), for a week when her brother’s mother-in-law becomes terminally ill. Though Kate is initially reluctant to take on Maddie due to her busy work schedule, the two gradually become closer and form an unusual friendship. Conflict rises as Maddie, an outcast at her school, befriends gas station attendant “Baby Joker” (Chris J. Beatrice) and becomes immersed into the world of the Juggalos, the term for a fan of the Insane Clown Posse hip hop group. Kate disapproves of Maddie’s new interests, and increasingly neglects Maddie due to troubles at work, where the ambitious and peppy new analyst Erin (Jessie Ennis) begins to threaten Kate’s position.
“Family” is an endearing, fun-to-watch, and occasionally cheesy story about the importance of family (as the name suggests) and work-life balance. Kate is successful in her career, evident in her position as senior vice president of her company, and does whatever it takes to get ahead of others and fulfill her ambitions, even if it means neglecting her personal life and throwing others under the bus. As a result, Kate’s coworkers dislike her, and her relationship with her brother and father are close to non-existent. Taylor Schilling puts on an excellent performance, perfectly encapsulating the socially awkward, unempathetic, and impassive Kate, with her constant blank stare and monotonous voice. One of the most noteworthy scenes occurs when, after what seems like minutes of heartfelt pleading from Kate’s brother asking her to take care of Maddie, Schilling bluntly and unemotionally replies “No.” However, Kate is somehow eventually persuaded off-screen and agrees to temporarily care for Maddie, which becomes the catalyst for the rest of a humorous plot.
Although performances by the rest of the cast are not extraordinary, the succinct and quirky plotline does a nice job of tying together the rest of the film, and the recurring theme of kindness is well-executed, though through unexpected and sometimes bizarre ways. For example, as the plot rises, the Juggalo community is repeatedly characterized as a congregation of “the worst people in the world.” When the gas station cashier reveals to Maddie’s parents that Maddie has run off to join the Juggalo gathering, he delivers the punchline: “I’m sorry for your loss.” However, a twist occurs when the film reveals that the Juggalos are actually quite kind. Small acts of kindness and compassion are also evident in other instances throughout the movie. The karate instructor Pete (Brian Tyree Henry), takes Kate and Maddie home from school when Kate is too drunk from drinking during a business lunch. Jill (Kate McKinnon), the next-door neighbor and stay-at-home mom, forgives Kate for injuring her legs and invites her over for a drink (although Kate drives away before hearing the offer). By the end of the movie, even Kate has learned to be more kind and caring towards the people in her life, showing effective character development.
Overall, though typical and cookie-cutter for a family comedy of its genre, “Family” is well-written and effectively accomplishes its goal as a feel-good, comedic, and family-oriented movie. Its topics are extremely relatable and relevant to many people today, who know all too well the pressures created by the desire for physical achievements and tangible successes, and as a result, neglect personal lives and relationships. “Family” teaches the different “Kates” of today’s age to create a balance between striving towards ambitions and nurturing personal happiness and relationships with loved ones.

Nicole Chung’s memoir, “All You Can Ever Know,” follows her struggles feeling like she didn’t fit in as Korean child adopted by a white couple. This transracial adoption has always affected Nikki, especially as an Asian girl growing up in a primarily white neighborhood. The story follows her internal conflicts about her adoptive family, her biological family, and her own decisions to create a family. Chung writes an emotional memoir that addresses more than just her personal story. “All You Can Ever Know” is a beautifully written book that addresses problems of race and family, drawing the reader in an emotional roller coaster that leaves them wanting to know more.
The most distinguishing aspect of the book is the structure. While most memoirs delve into one’s personal struggles and their own journey, Chung also narrates through the lens of her biological sister, Cindy. This new perspective provides the book with two different, gut-wrenching stories until the sisters eventually cross paths. Cindy is completely blindsided by the sudden appearance of Nikki, her younger sister who she believed had died in the hospital at birth. By focusing on how Cindy felt at the time, rather than her own thoughts, Chung provides further insights to what her life may have been like had she been raised by her birth parents. When Cindy discovers the truth, “she felt confused, disappointed, she was also resigned. All her life, it had been drilled into her not to talk back, not to get upset, not to question her family.” Chung’s view, expressed through her understanding tone, connects all of the characters and successfully mirrors the way that Chung felt: lost and confused. More importantly, her brilliant use of narratives from different perspectives deepens Chung’s own discovery of what family really means.
Chung’s thoughts are cleverly woven into her narratives, sharing with the reader her most vulnerable moments. Her honest insight into the life she was born into creates a vivid and dynamic picture for the reader and provides suspense in heightened moments of tension. Her blunt questioning, judgments, and second-guessing during moments of stress and discomfort are universal. For example, while addressing the racial issues she faced as a Korean woman growing up with white parents, Chung ponders that “to be a hero, [she] thought, you had to be beautiful and adored. To be beautiful and adored, you had to be white.” The way she opens herself up to the world when so many secrets were kept from her creates an alluring emotional attachment between the reader and the author. Her long train of thought is gripping.
Unfortunately, sometimes the alternating points of view can become confusing and muddled, interrupting the flow of the memoir. As the book progresses and Cindy’s and Nikki’s stories overlap, it becomes difficult to distinguish who is narrating the story. However, the overall effect of hearing multiple perspectives outweighs this small downside. The occasional colloquialism also interrupts the serious tone. With words and phrases like “crunchy” and “height of cool” used during moments that are both emotional and serious, Chung creates an odd and awkward contrast, rather than lightening the mood as what was most likely intended.
Overall, this heartbreaking yet bittersweet story draws the readers in through Chung’s exploration of her own thoughts and the consequences of her decisions. Chung proves that she is not a product of an environment she can’t control, but rather a human being in control of her own life.
Correction: Oct. 14, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the memoir "All You Can Ever Know" as a novel. It has been updated.

Social media provides some of the most universal experiences of millennial life: Almost everybody under the age of 30 has accidentally liked a crush’s old Instagram photo or sent a Snapchat to the wrong person. It’s only natural that popular culture should reflect our newfound obsession with social networks. Without them we’d have no “Black Mirror,” no memes, and no moody Drake lyrics about his ex. If the Internet can make us care about Drake’s love life, shouldn’t it be able to make us care about religion, too?
This question seems to have motivated the production of “God Friended Me,” a new entry into the canon of technology-driven television, which is exactly what its title suggests. The show seeks to answer a question that nobody ever really thought to ask: What would it be like to get a friend request from God? The fallout from this unexpected online interaction serves as the basis for the plot of the pilot episode, which was written by Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt. Lilien and Wynbrandt have written in the past for “Gotham” and “Hawaii Five-O” and their experience comes to light in the unexpected elements of procedural drama that pop up throughout “God Friended Me.”
Miles, the show’s protagonist (played by Brandon Michael Hall), works in New York City as a telemarketer by day and an aspiring podcaster by night. His podcast, called “The Millennial Prophet,” serves as a platform for him to promote his atheist beliefs: The brief clip that we hear him record features the blunt statement “There is no God, and that is Okay!” Soon after this scene, we learn that Miles’s father Arthur (Joe Morton) works as a minister, and suddenly the central tension between the show’s characters becomes clear. Miles, a fervent unbeliever, has constantly found himself at odds with his overtly religious father ever since his mother’s death in a car accident made him reconsider his faith.
The drama of the show begins to unfold as soon as Miles, just after recording another podcast, receives a friend request from none other than God himself. Eventually, after a series of divine omens appear all around him, he accepts the request. Throughout the show, God sends Miles notifications, suggesting new friends who he inevitably runs into in the real world. Miles saves his first new friend from a suicide attempt, and helps the second get over writer’s block. As the action unfolds, Miles refuses to believe that the online messages are really God’s work, and instead tries to find the person who could be catfishing him in such an elaborate way.
“God Friended Me” actually does a few things very well: Its characters are mostly well developed, its plot moves along at a compelling pace, and the earnestness with which it handles its premise is somewhat refreshing. However, in spite of the effectiveness of the show’s premise as a hook to draw viewers in, it seems unsure of how it actually wants to move forward. First of all, the pilot alone was full of far too many clichés. We’ve all seen way too many shows about a group of 20–somethings living and working in New York, never mind the fact that one of them is an Indian hacker who lives in his mom’s basement. Second, for a show about technology, “God Friended Me” does not seem to have a very good understanding of tech culture. Every single office that the characters occupy, even Miles’s telemarketing office, looks like some variation on a generic Silicon Valley startup. Furthermore, characters make strange passing comments like “I’m on Bumble bro, nobody uses Tinder anymore” that suggest that the showrunners are either doing a really ineffective job of subtle product placement or trying in vain to establish their credibility as people who know about tech.
Most irksome of all is the fact that the show seems entirely unable to settle on a particular tone. It could very easily lean into the comedy inherent in its premise, yet it appears reluctant to do so, instead imbuing its characters with complex emotional histories (the death of a mother, an alcoholic mother, etc.) that make it difficult to laugh at them at all. At the same time, though, the show is clearly dissatisfied with being a pure drama: In one scene, Rakesh (Suraj Sharma), has sex in Miles’s apartment with a girl his mom set him up with before being interrupted by a new wave of God’s hacking. “God Friended Me” labels itself a “dramedy,” but although such a balance of drama and comedy can be effective when handled well, it leads instead to jarring tonal shifts that keep viewers from ever really knowing how to feel.
All in all, “God Friended Me” puts forth a compellingly strange idea as its central premise, but its mishandled tone and out-of-touch “real millennial culture” is bemusing but ultimately dissatisfying.

Whoever hired this hitman deserves a refund. Despite being a self-proclaimed expert, Wilkes (Tom Bateman) is utterly incapable of hunting down a single group of drunken college students. Yet he seems utterly unaware of his own lack of skill, much like the show itself. Though “The Body,” the first episode of Blumhouse Productions’ new anthology “Into the Dark” aspires to be an edgy, self-aware thriller, and succeeds to some degree, those successes are completely overshadowed by the unlikable characters, the unnecessarily complicated plot, and poor writing that bogs down the episode.
Written and directed by Paul Davis and based on his 2013 short film of the same name, “The Body” follows Wilkes as he completes an assignment on Halloween night. Tasked with killing a man and delivering his body to a designated drop-off point, Wilkes wraps the body in plastic, disguising it as a Halloween prop, and drags it through the streets. After Wilkes is coerced into attending a Halloween party, a group of college students uncover his identity, discover the body, and steal it. Wilkes must track down the group with the help of his newfound accomplice, Maggie (Rebecca Rittenhouse), in order to deliver the body on time.
The episode begins with an interesting and compelling premise. Watching the hitman drag his deceased target through the streets unimpeded by others, who often congratulate him on an excellent Halloween costume, is entertaining and suspenseful as we wait for his disguise to ultimately fail. But when the hitman starts making illogical, impractical, and often irritatingly silly decisions, the suspense disappears. For instance, Wilkes agreeing to attend the Halloween party in exchange for a ride to his drop-off point, rather than finding an alternate means of transportation, is hard to believe. This is only one of dozens of examples of poor choices the character makes that call into question the validity of the profession he portrays. Additionally, once the body is stolen by the group of students, the compelling premise is all but gone as the film quickly devolves into nothing more than a typical, routine, slasher film.
This problem is only exacerbated by the poorly written, bothersome characters. It is difficult to sympathize with or root for any of them as they all continuously make poor decisions when an obvious, better solution is readily available. The motivation behind the group of students stealing the body is ridiculous and, once that plan is no longer valid, they move on to a worse, equally ridiculous plan, rather than calling the police or removing themselves from the situation. With one bad decision after another, it becomes impossible to care about what happens to them.
Similarly, the hitman’s incompetence is off-putting and unjustified. He continually forgets to finish off his victims and leaves obscene amounts of evidence. This could have been played for comedic effect but, instead, the show still tries to paint Wilkes as a seasoned killer as though unaware of how ineffective and bumbling the protagonist seems. He has no sense of urgency as he walks from location to location, even stopping for a drink in a local bar. This derails any tension that the stopwatch in the bottom right corner of the screen is meant to induce announcing how much time he has left to make his deadline. If he isn’t concerned about it, then why should we be? Perhaps we are supposed to be impressed by his arrogant indifference. I wasn’t. On the contrary, I was annoyed.
Additionally, the character, Maggie, is entirely unbelievable. After witnessing Wilkes kill an innocent bystander at the Halloween party, she decides to team up with him due to some latent dark tendencies inside her. The relationship between Wilkes and Maggie always feels forced, and her motivation for suddenly helping him is absurd.
Additionally, the story is not well written and cannot justify its feature-length runtime of 82 minutes. A large chunk of the episode is devoted to the three college students arguing with each other about their next course of action after stealing the body. These conversations go the exact same way every time, and never provide any meaningful information or entertainment. Similarly tedious, the hitman engages in at least three different philosophical rants about the meaning of life and death. They are supposed to be deep but come across as cheesy and redundant instead.
The writers also insert plot twists several times throughout the story in an effort to keep things engaging. However, each twist is clearly set-up and highly predictable. As a result, none of them really land, disappointing us instead.
Overall, this episode has a lot of problems. But it is not entirely without its moments. Its self-aware dialogue, along with certain comedic scenarios, insert welcome dark humor into the narrative. These scenes are largely effective and are breaths of fresh air amid the violence. Additionally, the first few minutes of the episode are interesting and the premise is engaging. Nonetheless, these successes are completely overshadowed by the glaring flaws that make the first episode of “Into the Dark” a rough start for the new Blumhouse series.
At the same time, despite the disappointing beginning, hope is not yet lost. This is merely the first episode of what is to be a 12-part anthology. In its other films, including “Get Out” and the “Insidious” series, Blumhouse Productions has proven itself to be a more than capable studio. With future episodes being undertaken by different writers and directors, the show’s future could be promising. Suspend judgment on the series as a whole until more episodes have come out and give Episode Two a chance when it premieres on Nov. 2. But until then, skip “The Body” in the hopes for a brighter future for the series.

Staged in a small Brookline church with simple lights, Scottish pennants, and a twig pentagram in the background, the Actors’ Shakespeare Project’s newest production, “Macbeth,” is filled with vitality. Its leads cultivate a level of realism that effectively integrates the audience into medieval Scotland: The audience holds its breath when Macbeth does and shivers right alongside Banquo. The production, directed by Dawn Meredith Simmons, runs from Sept. 26 to Nov. 11 at United Parish.
The performance marks the debut of Migdalia Cruz’s verse translation, written for the Oregon Shakespeare festival’s “Play On!” project. The script retains about 80 percent of the original verse, occasionally altering lines to provide clarity to a contemporary audience and promote diverse interpretations and textual accessibility. The understanding of the performance is rooted in the interpretation of the actors, rather than the original words. The translation is largely unnoticable, but there are moments when the translation breaks the narrative tension with contemporary idioms that do not entirely match the original lines.
The play itself centers around the ambitious and tragic Scottish thane Macbeth (Nael Nacer) whose fate is changed forever when he encounters three witches. In this production, they are characterized by sexual energy and move the plot forward by telling him he will be king. Macbeth is corrupted and begins to sink into a path of violence to establish and maintain his rule. He is spurred on by his wife, Lady Macbeth (Paige Clark). After killing King Duncan (Stephen Barkhimer), Macbeth attempts to centralize power through the murder of his friend Banquo (Maurice Parent). Through his actions, he slowly descends into madness.
Nael Nacer is particularly strong as Macbeth, playing him with an organic intensity. The basis of Nacer’s Macbeth is not the moments of heightened emotion or intense monologues — although he carries those well — but the subtlety of his overall performance, which lends his monologues an unprecedented weight and power, reinventing an iconic character in the process. At times, though, the transitions to and from the monologues feel rushed, somewhat taking away from Nacer’s performance.
Paige Clark as Lady Macbeth is equally riveting. As opposed to other productions that portray Lady Macbeth as power hungry and unidimensional, Clark’s character is painfully realistic, with a storied take that lends an unprecedented poignancy to the duo’s eventual downfall. The relationship between the two leads is the heart of this production. The pair spurs each other on, equal and intertwined. Despite the circumstances, love is placed at the forefront of their relationship and emphasized, giving their mutual descent into madness a unique realism and tragedy that other productions of “Macbeth” often neglect.
It’s also worth mentioning the performances of Banquo (Maurice Parent) and Macduff (Ed Hoopman), who ground the play in their characters’ stability, juxtaposing the volatility of Lord and Lady Macbeth. Banquo’s fierce stillness when he posthumously appears to Macbeth in the famous banquet scene is eerie and haunting, and Macduff’s tender, traumatized performance when he learns of the death of his wife and children is one of the most moving scenes of the play.
The strength of the lead actors, however, makes small errors or weaknesses in the production apparent, due to the high caliber of the overall performance. The Shakespearean background and professionalism of the leads shine through, but they are not always buttressed by the supporting cast. The stage combat comes across as almost silly. While the fight scenes are blocked well, the actual motions feel comical, detracting from the import of key moments, such as Macbeth’s death. The double casting also hinders the production at times — the recasting of lead roles is confusing, particularly given the reappearance of deceased characters like Banquo. At times, the audience is left to decipher whether a character has re-appeared to haunt Macbeth or has been recast in a new role. A scene where the witches sing and rap their lines feels deeply atonal to the point of parody, and almost at odds with the overall performance.
In spite of these aberrant moments, this production is a well-constructed look at the humanity of Lord and Lady Macbeth. Elizabeth Cahill’s sound design is ethereal, with a lightness and a cleverness that transports the audience. The parish of Brookline evokes a religious undercurrent throughout the piece and effectively integrates the medieval world into our own. While the high-level of performance makes minor discrepancies more noticeable, the ability to cultivate and maintain the otherworldly realm of Macbeth is remarkable, conveying anxiety and the tumult of medieval life.

The President of the United States announces a controversial act that tears families apart. Diehard conservatives question the loyalty that minority groups hold for our country. Left-wing protests are labeled as violent and irrational, apparently justifying the use of extreme police force in counteraction. No, this isn’t the front page of a newspaper; these familiar scenes merely form the backdrop for Ike Barinholtz’s highly political directorial debut, “The Oath.” The balance between comedy and politics is key to what makes this film unique, but while the humor consistently hits the mark, the political themes lack the emotional impact delivered by movies like “Get Out” and “BlacKkKlansman,” who share a team of producers in common with “The Oath.”
The comedy-thriller follows a traditional American family’s efforts to not get too political on Thanksgiving, which turns out to be easier said than done. Exacerbated by the recent passage of the “Loyalty Oath,” a law which compels Americans to declare their loyalty for their country by Black Friday, the joyous sharing of turkey, stuffing, and pumpkin pie quickly devolves into a gory fightreslting in broken noses, gunshot wounds, and tasers. The question “What are our options?” reverberates through the air, especially as the family must figure out what to do with two government agents they may or may not have accidentally kidnapped. However ridiculous the premise, it does allow for some interesting moral questions, particularly for the protagonist, Chris (Ike Barinholtz).
The family represents a variety of points on the political spectrum, with Chris clearly being the resident liberal. Despite the fact that Barinholtz himself largely shares his character’s political views, Chris does not escape the movie completely unscathed by criticism and satire. He is far from a sympathetic character, perhaps made most clear by the way he treats his family: It is Chris who first starts an argument at Thanksgiving dinner relatively unprovoked, and his constant forgetting of his sister-in-law’s name is both a humorous recurring joke and a jerk move. Ultimately, Chris’ wife Kai (Tiffany Haddish), who shares his political views but not so much his anger, is portrayed in the best light. Haddish’s character as the voice of reason is predictably a highlight of the film, but her portrayal as “the one who’s right” suggests that there is no place for anger in politics.
The movie’s greatest success is in its comic relief, which centers primarily on relatable humor. The subject of a politically divisive Thanksgiving dinner is a popular one to make fun of, partly due to the fact that so many people can relate to the feeling of having that one racist uncle. Of course, “The Oath” amplifies this theme by a thousand — most Thanksgiving dinners probably don’t end in actual bloodshed — but at its core is a family tension that is ripe for satire. For better or for worse, watching this movie will probably give you the same secondhand stress you get from watching your family argue about politics, but at least here you don’t have to fear being dragged in. Other relatable family moments, like the stereotypically awkward relationship between father and son or older parents not quite used to using TV remotes, keep the laughter going at a relatively consistent pace.
However, a political comedy must succeed on two fronts: Not only is it important to keep the laughs going, but a coherent message should also be a thought-provoking undercurrent of the film. This is where “The Oath” begins to show its weaknesses. Though there are plenty of mini political messages here and there, the only unified theme that comes across is that of “family first,” one which we’ve seen countless times in countless formats. The film’s ending relies on a deus ex machina — which would be fine — but it undercuts the real life implications the film only hinted at.
“The Oath” lends itself to comparison with other recent politically charged movies like “Get Out” and “BlacKkKlansman,” in its attempt to combine comedy and commentary. In fact, one of the film’s key selling points, as evidenced by a title card on the film’s trailer, is the fact that the three films share a producing team, comprised of Edward Hamm, Ray Mansfield and Sean McKittrick. Unfortunately, “The Oath” falls short in the way in unconvincingly tries to inspire a politically moving reaction in its audience. With the other two, it would be next to impossible to walk out of the theater without an unsettled feeling in your stomach and a desire to fight injustice. “The Oath,” on the other hand, though enjoyable, ends when you leave the theater. It is perfectly possible to continue living life as you were, and to only remember the movie as a silly Thanksgiving comedy. Sure, expecting a movie to change the viewers’ lives is certainly a high standard to hold it to, but other films have certainly proved that it is possible. As a result, “The Oath” feels like nothing more than a long SNL skit — political comedy that plays it too safe to be anything greater.

It would have been an egregious oversight for “Saturday Night Live” to cover anything other than the main story occupying national headlines in their cold open, and yet it somehow still felt like a misstep. The cold open of the season premiere featured Matt Damon as a weepy, indignant Brett Kavanaugh testifying in front of an apathetic Senate Judiciary, and in the immediate wake of Kavanaugh’s confirmation, last Saturday’s honed in on the triumphant locker room of Senate Republicans celebrating a recent victory. It’s an unfavorable indicator that the most striking part of the sketch was the prosthetic chin soldered to Beck Bennett’s face, giving an eerily authentic approximation of Mitch McConnell’s jowls. In both sketches, Kate McKinnon, patron saint of Studio 8H, was the usual saving grace, playing both Lindsey Graham’s “this is a sham!” courtroom diatribe and overjoyed postgame celebration with the kind of unhinged verve that’s become her signature. (Perhaps it’s the vestigial memory of her poignant post-election piano performance, but McKinnon always commands a kind of trust, as if these impersonations are safe in her capable, Emmy-winning hands.)
But even McKinnon’s efforts weren’t quite enough. Writing for Vulture, Mark Harris points out that SNL’s portrayal was less a specific satirical take on the hearing than a hyperbolic rehashing. With a comedic landscape dominated by late night hosts like Seth Meyers, John Oliver, and Samantha Bee, who handled the ongoing hearing with poise and razor-sharp intellect, Harris argues that SNL needed to bring a more angled and astringent take to the table.
Actually, I’d argue that SNL didn’t just fail to contribute to a conversation — they actively detracted from it. It’s surprising that few critics noted the oddness of casting Matt Damon, given his comments on the #MeToo movement back in 2017, which seemed to conflate false accusations with legitimate claims. Damon later apologized, but what did it matter? A powerful male voice had already undermined a crucial movement for women in his industry when he could have offered support or — here’s a novel idea — even stayed silent. This was not Damon’s conversation to weigh in on, yet he did with a kind of masculine self-assurance that echoed unsettlingly in his portrayal of Kavanaugh. Here was a man who used his platform to disparage a women’s movement, now asserting himself as an ally, costumed in the shoes of a man who purportedly used his status and power to brutalize a woman in the most violent way available to him, short of actual murder — and he was treating this portrayal with ill-fitting levity. For a moment toward the end of the cold open, it seemed as if Damon was about to break character and giggle.
And therein lies the issue. “Saturday Night Live” has been known to take on sensitive subject matters, from ISIS to slavery to the opioid crisis, through their signature comedic lens. But with Kavanaugh, they weren’t just lampooning a polemic in the vague abstract, like with most sketches that tackle “racism” in an untargeted, conceptual way. This sketch was not about “sexism” or “misogyny” as intangible concepts. This was a woman’s story, one woman whose life was unfairly upended by a boy at a high school party, whose trauma was aired out again and again, broadcasted to a national audience, whose appearance and tone of voice and account were forensically dissected for inconsistencies, whose physical appearance was critiqued by senators and the President. All too absent from the SNL cold opens was Christine Blasey Ford herself, who seemed overshadowed by cartoonish portrayals of her alleged assaulter, erased fully from the narrative that belonged, critically, to her.
During the hearing, when Senator Patrick Leahy asked Ford about the most powerful, enduring memory from the traumatic night of her assault, Ford said, “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter. The uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.”
“You’ve never forgotten that laughter,” Leahy said.
“They were laughing with each other,” Ford said. “I was underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another.”
What’s fair game for laughter, and who gets to laugh, is inextricably linked with differentials in power. One girl’s trauma was the source of laughter for two young men who knew privilege would protect them from consequences. That laughter stayed with her while, she, only 15 years old, left the party that summer night in 1982. It stayed with her while she attempted to come to terms with the trauma she endured by researching it at Stanford and USC, attempting to conquer it with science. It stayed with her as she stood before a committee of senators in order to block her alleged abuser from being appointed to the highest court in the nation, and although she has not publicly commented on his recent confirmation, I imagine that it stays with her now, watching the man who allegedly pinned her down at a party and laughed uproariously at her trauma take on a lifetime position to the Supreme Court.
Of course, I’m grateful that SNL chose not to portray Ford — an impression that, as Harris writes, would be deeply insensitive and obviously, would not lend itself well to comedic interpretation. As someone who knows very little about sketch comedy, I’m not even sure I can prescribe a comprehensive solution. And to SNL’s credit, laughter can sap an object of its power, and comedy can be a means of keeping the powerful in check. Comedy can be a forceful tool for marginalized people in the face of oppression, who use it as a vehicle to seek affirmation and to commiserate with one another. That’s part of what the show has done best, since the beginning of the Trump administration.
But it can also have the effect of trivializing and delegitimizing the subject, of making it seem hokey and unintimidating, undercutting the degree to which the subject represents a real threat. In 2016, in advance of the presidential election, Jimmy Fallon amicably mussed Trump’s hair during his appearance on the Tonight Show. Trump even hosted “Saturday Night Live.” Talk show appearances, sketch comedy hosting, reality TV — the whole of his campaign was something of a joke, a surreal extended bit. Until it became real. Until the SNL promos and TV spots turned into the televised inauguration ceremony. He told us there was nothing to be scared of. We believed him.
A joke has power. It matters who’s in on it, and who’s outside of it. Making fun of something requires replicating it in some way; to make fun of hate speech, it has to be repeated. Christine Blasey Ford, and all survivors, do not deserve to have their trauma made into a tidy sketch, or impersonated with grotesque caricaturish exaggeration.
There’s a subtle difference between making fun and making light. To paint Brett Kavanaugh as a whiny, impetuous manchild who tearfully waxes poetic about beer and 1980s calendars is funny — but it’s also dangerous. Kavanaugh has just been appointed to a lifetime position of power, and the effects of his decisions will reverberate through generations. It’s time we understand the danger of our jokes.

“Bad Times at the El Royale” is everything that “The Hateful Eight” should have been. Now, since I’m a Quentin Tarantino fan, those words were hard to type. But, it is impossible to ignore that writer and director Drew Goddard (“The Martian,” “Cabin in the Woods”) has taken Tarantino’s single-location style and perfected it. From the first moments of the film, which are completely devoid of dialogue, to the first bloody gunshot, viewers are left engrossed and in suspense. Goddard escalates the tension that is key to this film’s success. With enough twists and turns to give you whiplash, the film is gripping and all-around entertaining from start to finish, owing to this sense of mystery, intrigue, and confusion that surrounds everything that the characters do.
Unlike most modern films, the trailer for “Bad Times at the El Royale” is surprisingly vague, largely owing to the mystery, confusion, and multiple plot twists that are crucial to the film’s efficacy. Therefore, it’s hard to say anything about this film besides, “Go see it.” Nonetheless, to give any indication of what to expect: In the late 1960s, seven strangers converge on the once-proud “El Royale” motel, split in half by the California-Nevada border. All of them are there with a purpose, all of them have secrets, and as their paths cross and interests overlap, the situation becomes more and more dangerous. People are lost, alliances are formed, and the suspense builds up to an exhilarating, heart-pounding finale.
Suspense is critical to the film’s potency and Goddard achieves it through his brilliant use of “show don’t tell” filmmaking. Too often nowadays, filmmakers and writers resort to clunky exposition and cheap backstories as a way of feeding the audience crucial information about the characters. A film’s action or plot will seemingly halt while a character delivers a crucial piece of information. In “Bad Times at the El Royale,” this is never the case. Each piece of information that is necessary for understanding the characters is blended seamlessly into the narrative. The conversations feel natural and lend depth and believability to each of the seven strangers. Their lives, backstories, and motivations have weight. Furthermore, there comes a point where it stops feeling like we are watching a film, and more as though we have been dropped straight into the lives of these characters. The characters’ stories are entirely their own, and we only learn that which they are willing to share. This adds a degree of realism to the slightly-absurd premise, and makes for a compelling mystery. The realism is enhanced by strong performances from Jon Hamm (Laramie Sullivan, a vacuum salesman), Jeff Bridges (Father Daniel Flynn), and relative newcomer Cynthia Erivo (Darlene Sweet, a singer).
Furthermore, the film continuously defies audience expectations with its twisting narrative, making each moment interesting and unpredictable. Since direction of the plot is unexpected, the film is never dull, as simple moments can have large consequences and effects. Near the middle of the film, as two characters have a tense discussion in a car with one pointing a pistol at the other, we are never entirely sure whether or not that pistol will go off and, if it does, who will be on the receiving end of the bullet.
The cinematography also works well for the overall tone of the film. Goddard’s use of long takes, where several minutes pass without the camera cutting, further adds to the realism of the scenes. Giving the actors several minutes of uncut screen-time allows them to play off each other’s inflections, tones, and expressions, making each conversation and interaction flow more naturally than if a series of rapid cuts were used. Additionally, Goddard uses distance as a key factor in setting up his shots. The camera is either far away from the character or object that is, seemingly, the object of focus for a scene, or extremely zoomed-in. The closeups are clear indicators of the importance of an object or a scene, and as the camera zooms-in, the tension and suspense go up. Goddard expertly weaves his shots together to manipulate the emotions and viewpoints of the audience to maximize the effectiveness of each scene.
Despite the quality of the film, there are a few glaring issues. While there are some strong performances, Chris Hemsworth’s cult leader character and the “final showdown” feel tonally out of place in what was an otherwise compelling mystery. Once the mystery dissolves, and the blood starts flowing, the film shifts into more of an action-film, leaving behind what made it compelling in the first place. And while Hemsworth tries his best to pull off a California accent, he can’t help but let some of the Australian slip through, which takes away from the scene when it becomes apparent that he’s just acting.
But perhaps the most glaring issue is that, after the dust has settled and the survivors are left to regroup, Goddard leaves viewers with the question, “What’s the point of all this?” Throughout the film there is an emphasis on the juxtaposition of two opposing sides (e.g. the Nevada-California border, good vs. evil, right vs. wrong). While this is an important thematic element, there is nothing really to take away from the film. The film does seem to pose the question of whether these characters are redeemable, but the answer seems fairly clear: “No.”
Despite a few problems, “Bad Times at the El Royale” takes the best elements from previous, similar films (“Reservoir Dogs,” “The Hateful Eight”) and perfects them. The uncertainty and suspense that underlie each scene make for an exhilarating film from start to finish. And ultimately, the benchmark for what should make a good movie is, “Does this film entertain?” This one absolutely does. You’ll have a good time at the “El Royale.”

Content warning: This piece contains situations of sexual violence and abuse, as well as discussions of trauma and mental illness.
When I opened my eyes, the room was filled with a blinding white light. But it didn’t hurt me, because I was a part of it too — I looked down, eyes running over the skin of my Brown legs and torso, fingers reaching down to trace the outline of my navel, and I knew I was alive.
God created me, alone in this white room with nothing in it but the skin on my back and the nails on my fingertips. I instinctively knew what to do, so I did it: I stood on my two feet, raised my tentacled hands, looked into the one mirrored wall in the square room, and I danced.
***
Then, he came. My dance became wilder, full of a passion I’d never known before, my 15 year-old figure thrashing in all directions, attempting to match the tango of my furiously beating heart.
Then, he took away the mirror, but I kept going. I did not need to see my reflection to move — he saw me clearly enough for the both of us. He loved me! And oh, I loved him so!
Then, he turned off the light, but of course I kept going. I did not need to see my limbs moving, taking shape — he knew any possible form they could take anyway. He knew it better than anyone, and besides, now I could be wilder, even less controlled.
Now, maybe I could stop worrying about matching the rhythm of my heart, tether it to his instead.
***
Then, he told me the shirt I wore to that party showed a bit too much cleavage, and that his mom had commented on it. If I was going to be his future wife, that sort of thing needed to change.
Then, he told me if I didn’t send him nudes he’d tell everyone what a slut I really was, shatter the image of that nice girl I pretended to be — what kind of father lets a girl act that way, anyway? That’s what they get for moving young girls there. That’s what happens to our girls in America.
Then, he told me to touch myself on camera, to stop fucking crying about it, to get some water and get over it, to shut the fuck up because I was just wrong all the time and I’d never be right for him and it was just all WRONG. I was WRONG.
Then, he told me if I loved him I needed to prove it. He told me I needed to go get hit by a car — not hard enough to kill me, but just enough for him to know what he needed to know.
***
My dance had stopped by this point, if you haven’t already guessed that.
***
When I ended it, it wasn’t because I understood what he was doing to me. It was because he slept with my cousin, when sex was still The Sacred Thing you only do with your husband. When he told me that he did it to spite me.
It was too late for me though — I was already a slut. No one would ever love me now because I was used up already, and not even REALLY used up because I would still bleed on my wedding night, but used up enough. And a real Muslim man — actually, any man — could never love me again because I didn’t deserve it.
When I ended it, I became afraid. The Fear seeped out of my entire being, the fear of him becoming The Fear of his kind.
My fear had advanced beyond him, but that can’t be my fault, right? Something is seriously wrong with our kind. Why do we keep creating problems for everyone? Why is every next terrorist attack perpetrated by Muslims? Why is Pakistan ranked one of the worst countries in the world for women? Why are Muslim countries so fucking backwards? Why don’t we have electricity? Why can’t I drink the tap water here? Why are men leering at me on the street? Why are there so many poor people in this Godforsaken country?
And anyway, why do Muslim Men hate Muslim Women so God damned much?
***
I was lying on the floor in the darkness of the room by this point, when God sent Them.
First, Edward Said: The West has constructed an image of the East as static, unmoving. Of the Oriental man as violent and threatening. Of the East as backwards, of the Brown man as the terrorist.
Second, my father: My father was the sole evidence I had that Brown Muslim man does not have to be violent to woman. He loved my mother in a way that saved me from hating his kind, from hating my kind, from hating myself.
***
The healing was not quick. It took me a year after ending it to name it: abuse. It took eight therapists, six years of therapy, three medications, two leaves of absence, and five years before I could name the next it: PTSD.
It took reliving That Toxic Relationship with male friends; it took flashbacks to crying while he commanded me to keep going; it took unlearning the idea that sexual pleasure is always for Him, and never for me.
It took understanding I was afraid of men, but especially Brown Muslim Men. It took unlearning that fear through the only example of positive Muslim Love I had.
***
I’m dancing again. Light dimmer, sure, but the mirror is back up, I am in control again. I know that I am one of the lucky ones.

I wanted to love Broadway’s “Mean Girls.” As a fan of the 2004 movie, I could see how it could translate perfectly to the stage. I was ready to put the soundtrack on loop and bask in the glow of a well-written celebration of women.
Instead, the musical not only contains major structural issues but delivers a core message that is uncomfortably muddled by a seemingly minor change: the cause of Cady’s moral epiphany. Despite its enjoyable music and quippy lyrics, the “Mean Girls” musical ultimately fails to deliver a strong message of female empowerment.
The “Mean Girls” story begins with Cady Heron moving to the U.S. from Africa, where she has been homeschooled for most of her life. Suddenly immersed in the back-handed, high-pressure atmosphere of high school, she struggles to make friends. Although social outcasts Janis and Damian are immediately welcoming to her, Cady finds herself drawn to Regina George and her fellow “plastics” — i.e. popular girls. On Janis’ urging, Cady infiltrates Regina’s group to play the spy in “a fun little experiment.” However, as Cady attempts to seduce Aaron Samuels, Regina’s ex-boyfriend, and dethrone the queen bee, she becomes more and more “plastic” until she can no longer claim that it is only an act.
The turning point in the story is when Cady realizes that she does not like the person she has become and attempts to make amends with those she has wronged. This recognition comes at a different moment in the musical than in the film.
In the movie, the realization begins to dawn at a party and reaches its climax at the Mathletes competition. At the party, Aaron tells Cady that she is “just like a clone of Regina,” but the comment obviously does not resonate with Cady, who chases after him and yells, “Call me!” After a similar confrontation with Janis, Cady is left deep in thought. African music, a nod to her past and former self, begins to play, marking the beginnings of a change.
Her full epiphany, however, does not come until the Mathletes competition. After mentally berating the appearance of a female opponent, Cady realizes that “making fun of Caroline Krafft wouldn’t stop her from beating me in this contest…Calling somebody else fat won’t make you any skinnier. Calling someone stupid doesn’t make you any smarter. And ruining Regina George’s life definitely didn’t make me any happier. All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.” As the turning point in Cady’s character arc, this moment is organic and believable, affirming the merit of self-discovery. The climax, and the movie as a whole, encourages young girls to focus on building themselves up instead of tearing others down.
The musical shifts the focus away from the Mathletes competition, instead playing out the epiphany entirely within the context of the party. In the song “More Is Better,” Cady argues that she is not as bad as Regina, asking him who he would prefer. He replies, “I would prefer the girl you were.” Instantly, the music changes — akin to the use of African music in the film — and provides an earnest and compelling underscore as he continues: “You think this works with me. / Well, you thought wrong. / Looking at this place, / I see you trying to erase / what is best about yourself just to belong.” In this version of the story, Cady is undeniably affected by his words, softly agreeing that she “should have thought it through a bit [more].”
Aaron’s mansplaining is condescending and hypocritical. When Cady was still “the girl [she was],” he chose Regina. But this change also creates a much larger issue. In framing Cady’s decision around Aaron’s preference, the musical inadvertently promotes the toxic — and already far too prevalent — belief that women should curate their behavior to please men.
Cady’s agency is stripped away as her epiphany shifts from an internal realization to the acceptance of external advice. This change endorses the idea that women should allow outside opinions to dictate their actions, problematic in any context but even more so in a story where self-determination is a driving theme. Cady has not stopped molding her beliefs to others’ expectations. She has merely shifted from conforming to the plastics’ idea of perfection to conforming to Aaron’s, contradicting a core lesson of the film: that it is the individual who is responsible for their actions.
This loss is even more disappointing given the positive influence that the musical could have had if handled more attentively. The “Mean Girls” movie has remained a fan favorite because it considers topics that are rarely done justice, if addressed at all: the overwhelming pressure to conform, the subtle nuances of “girl world,” the power dynamics of high school, and the profound seriousness of the stakes involved. These aspects of youth impact women for the rest of their lives, and they deserve more attention. Although some of these ideas are touched upon in the show, none is given its due weight. The “Mean Girls” musical could have made a potent statement about the complexity of the female experience in a patriarchal culture. Instead, it subtly reaffirms the same male dominance that the movie strove to reject.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does it mean to look at Kara Walker?
Since her first mural in 1994, this Negress has captured the minds, hearts, and genitals of her fellow Negroes, plastering them on the walls of the National Gallery of Art, MoMA, the Whitney, and countless galleries and institutions across the Nation. Auntie Walker’s murals are populated by silhouettes of what we are told are Black bodies. We are also told that they are Black bodies in anguish, suffering under the yoke of American oppression.
We know what a Black body in anguish looks like, we think. These are the bodies of Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave,” Lupita Nyong’o’s internationally-acclaimed back arching in carefully arranged pain. These are the bodies of Ava Duvernay’s “Selma,” taller-than-life Black human beings ferocious in their Biblical dignity. These are the bodies of Kehinde Wiley’s Barack Obama and LL Cool J, blessed with iron eyes to pierce the looker and turn their attempts at voyeurism to dust.
But those are not Kara Walker’s Black Bodies. The Black bodies Auntie Walker samples are not proud; they are not strong; they are not good; they are not granted eyes; they are not beautiful. Take one of Walker’s recent works: “Auntie Walker’s Wall Sampler of Savages” and its partner “Auntie Walker’s Wall Sampler for Civilians.” Auntie Walker’s Black bodies are muddy, gritty, twisted, ugly. They are rendered as silhouettes, stripped of all eyes to see and hearts to hope. Their flabby lips, the only facial feature visible, grin apeish grins. They suck their master’s genitals. Their severed heads bounce about the walls. Little black girls and little black boys are stripped naked. Black breasts hang heavy. Black blood and gristle pools warmly.
These bodies are not even given the dignity of humanity, not even given the chance to suffer their trauma with the righteous indignation of Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Oyelowo. They are monsters, minstrels, punching bags, jokes, caricatures. They are nothing; there is no one, no human, there.
Frantz Fanon reminds us that “The Negro is a toy in the white man’s hand.” Throughout history, aesthetic representations of Black bodies have become tools for the systematic oppression of real Black folks. These representations rob Black bodies of their humanity. They become objects for white supremacy to play with, simultaneously political tools and sources of laughter and mockery. The theorist Calvin Warren points to Uncle Remus, and Uncle Tom, the caricatured Negro passed about in antebellum Confederate propaganda. These caricatures are examples of the power white art has over Blackness. In caricature, whiteness performs its greatest magic act; the Black body becomes a toy.
We can see caricature everywhere, but particularly in low art: mass produced art, non-professional art, aesthetic work that would not belong in a museum. Caricature thus abounds in advertisements, Disney cartoons, propaganda, mass film, magazine sketches, and burlesque, and is absent in the art — assuredly guilty of its own racial sins — of Velazquez, Calvi, and Gerome.
This link between the violence of the caricature and low art is no accident. High art — art worthy of cultural protection and institutionalization — operates by establishing standards of taste, dignity, and goodness, normative evaluations of artistic beauty. Despite high art’s inherent fetishization of Blackness, its constraints do force Blackness to be represented beautifully, even with dignity. Without these constraints, low art is able to inject ugliness into Blackness, delegitimizing it so that it becomes an object not for aesthetic appreciation but for mockery.
Why then, would Auntie Walker so gleefully and ferociously wrest away our dignity, pinning us up against the museum walls like butterflies in a white man’s study?
In bringing caricature into the museum, Kara Walker screws with the institution itself. If Beyonce’s “Apeshit” reveals a commitment to Black absorption into institutions of power, then Auntie Walker’s wall samplers challenge that institution on its own terms. When artists like Wiley, McQueen, and Duvernay remain committed to elevating the Black body, to placing it among high art, Walker rejects this obsession with elitism. Instead, she reclaims Blackness through the dangerous violence of low art.
High art pretends as though it is the only aesthetic possibility. It believes that the set of racist criteria it champions ought to police all works of art. Walker proffers her Black bodies as evidence that high art’s desire for hegemony is doomed to fail. There have always existed, she reminds the museum world, alternate ways of representing Blackness. Walker’s Black bodies burst onto the scene of high art to remind it of the existence of a counterculture, a countercanon, a counter-aesthetic rooted in low art.
Walker is of course aware that the alternative modes of representation she explores are anti-Black. That is, though caricature as low art breaks with the specific racist constraints of high art, it remains trapped within a white supremacist aesthetic project. Caricature escapes high art, but not whiteness.
In the wake of works like Beyonce’s “Apeshit,” one begins to wonder if there exist aesthetic possibilities for marginalized artists outside of the confines of high art. In caricature, Walker presents just such a possibility. She finds this potential in low art, which if still dominated by white supremacy, allows for alternative representations of Blackness.
Walker thus sets up us to question further: What if we had power to redefine Blackness, or indeed any marginalized identity? What if low art gives us a specific and privileged path to a kind of self-definition, or a new form of political critique? In low art, Walker finds more than respectability politics, more than power, more than liberal hand-wringing, more than racist expectations of what beauty must be, what art must be. In low art, she finds freedom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jay Gonzalez proposed a tax on large university endowments in a Harvard Square speech last month, he set off a dispute within this editorial section. The Editorial Board (of which I, a mere columnist, am not a member) voted to condemn the tax as a “new attack on Harvard [and] higher ed.” In a dissenting opinion, three board members argued that Harvard’s high revenues mean the tax would have “little effect” on Harvard. Never mind the math: At $500 million, the tax would have taken over 10 percent of the university’s operating expenses of $4.9 billion for 2017. (And if Harvard would barely notice $500 million, why would it better help Massachusetts, whose yearly expenditures approach $42 billion?)
But they do present a more serious argument, even if it receives fewer inches. “If Harvard were truly committed to educational equity, it would be supportive of redistributive policies that would increase access to quality education for all students,” the dissenters write. This claim blankly assumes that $500 million added to the education budget would, in fact, improve educational outcomes, despite mixed-at-best evidence for that causal relationship. But the more fundamental point is even more widely held — and even more troubling: Governments spend more effectively, from the perspective of social justice, than citizens or private organizations, even in philanthropy.
This argument takes on an urgency with the increasing concentration of wealth among a few mega-billionaires. After Jay-Z and Beyonce surprised a teenager with a $100,000 scholarship, University of Southern California assistant professor of writing Ryan Boyd quipped, “Now let’s surprise them with a 90 percenttop tax rate.” CNNMoney reporter Lydia DePillis raised it in the form of a question: “Jeff Bezos is putting $2 billion into homelessness and preschool. Laudable. But you have to ask —is this better than just taxing the wealth of the richest man in the world, and making that money democratically accountable?”
Let’s combine these related points. Is the world be a better place because the Knowles-Carter clan’s $100,000, Harvard’s $500 million, and Bezos’s $2 billion fund a talented high-schooler, cutting-edge research, and homeless shelters, rather than being taken by the “democratically accountable” state?
Yes.
At the federal level, the most obvious reason is that the government is emphatically not democratically accountable — a point particularly salient in the days after Brett M. Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice ever to win this anti-democratic trifecta: nominated by a president who lost the popular vote, confirmed by a Senate representing less than 50 percent of the country, all while a majority of the country opposed his nomination. And that calculation assumes these elections are fair: States variously bar the formerly incarcerated and legal immigrants from voting, gerrymander districts, close polling places, set arbitrarily early registration deadlines, and American citizens in Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have no representation in Congress. These manipulations advantage those in power — mostly at the expense of the poor and the nonwhite. To whatever extent taxes are spent by the popular will, that negotiation often excludes the most vulnerable.
Boyd and DePillis might reply that the solution is to reform that broken system, and we should. But we should certainly reform before we start wishing Bezos’s $2 billion had been in government hands. And Gonzalez might note that Massachusetts avoids many of those anti-democratic evils, but democratic accountability does not imply good policy: Large majorities have supported the use of tax dollars on projects like the war on drugs and the invasion of Iraq.
Most directly relevant for Gonzalez’s pitch, though, is that even well-intentioned, popular policies tend to fail to achieve their aims. Social Security, the second-biggest federal expenditure, actually transfers wealth from members of the working class, who tend to both start contributing to the program earlier (as fewer go to college) and stop drawing its benefits earlier (as their life expectancy is lower). Why should we prefer that Bezos’s money fund the military and the retirements of the middle class rather than the housing and early childhood education of America’s poorest?
As for Massachusetts’s education budget, I linked to this above, but it bears repeating: The evidence does not convincingly show that funding improves school performance, except at the low end. Gonzalez could much more effectively improve Massachusetts schools by redistributing a bit from Weston and Wellesley to Mendell and McKinley, rather than forcing Harvard to cut its expenses by 10%.
When non-profit entities like Harvard, private citizens like Jay-Z, or even robber barons like Jeff Bezos fund things that benefit society, we should applaud them. They tend to be pretty good at it: They target their spending more precisely, with fewer politically-driven diversions and better incentives. (If you’re skeptical that Harvard’s funding goes to good use, consider that it costs much more to fund medical research than to let a bunch of MBAs network, and the 10 percent cut will hit the former first and hardest.) We should not wish that wealth had funneled directly through the Internal Revenue Service — especially in the status quo, when it would go on to fund war, mass incarceration, child imprisonment, regressive redistribution, and well-intentioned waste.

Let us make no mistake: The courts of American public opinion are just as powerful as our actual courts of law, for better and far often for worse. But in the courts of public opinion, that hallowed Anglo-American legal standard of “innocent until proven guilty” is far from universal. The past two decades of sordid politics-as-usual have revealed that gender, judicial philosophy, political affiliation, and other identity labels are litmus tests for whom the public opinion courts will extend “innocent until proven guilty.”
Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) made as much clear when she refused to grant besieged Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh this standard based on “everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches cases.” President Bill Clinton’s strategists made as much clear when they urged the country not to rush to believe the allegations leveled against him, piling lovely epithets such as “bimbo eruption” and “trailer trash” onto his female accusers. The goalposts of justice will move wherever they need to based on the labels of accuser and accused.
The hysterical circus of this nomination and the tragedies of both Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford are not at all surprising in a society that is deeply, deeply confused about what it thinks about sex. We rightly consider sexual assault and rape to be heinous crimes because they violate the dignity inherent in every human being. We correctly express righteous anger at confirmed perpetrators of such crimes. These crimes are truly egregious and should not be taken lightly, and we truly ought to extend every ounce of empathy and support we can to survivors. Sexuality is closely intertwined with human sanctity, even if not always expressed or understood in this way.
If only we acted like sex is the matter of human dignity and sanctity that it truly is! Instead, society perpetuates a cheapened and contractual attitude towards sex under the auspices of “empowerment” or “my body my choice” or “liberation.” College campuses everywhere have led a “consent” crusade where anything seems to go as long as there is “enthustiastic” and continuous yes without the influence of alcohol or drugs. Consent is an imperative bare minimum for a most basic standard of human dignity, I acknowledge, but it is only an inadequate and unsatisfying condition that fails to provide a more meaningful or more fully humanizing framework of human sexuality.
I certainly admit that a world hypersensitive to the standards of consent is better than an insensitive one. But taken to its logical end, consent is simply a contract in which people use each other as means to an end. I’m sorry, but no amount of platitudes, niceties, or childish metaphors about making someone a cup of tea is going to convince me otherwise. The alternative to consent is not its elimination, not by any means, but if anything, we ought to consider whether there’s something deeply amiss in the casual sex/hookup/serial dating culture that consent often takes as its inputs.
I do believe that a response to the deep-seated societal toxicity that the #MeToo reckoning has brought to light has been needed for a long time. This movement hasn’t come out of nowhere, and I strongly believe that the sexual “liberation” movement of the late 1960’s sowed the seeds for decades of silenced survivors and destroyed lives. Powerful Hollywood and cultural moguls preyed on underage starstruck youths, and “liberated” society was largely content to let it happen.
We are long due for a reckoning. It is starting to dawn on us that this “liberation” ideology did not free us, but instead chained us. I can’t help but balk at the incongruity I see rampant in the questionable campus prosecution of alleged perpetrators of sexual crimes and the laissez-faire attitude with which that same campus scatters free condoms and sex toys to every dorm. I balk at the double standards and public opinion litmus tests to which we either believe or condemn accusers and accused.
Holding extremely paradoxical views of sex will not do us any favors. If we act like sex and hook-ups are really just meaningless things that only require mere affirmation from participating parties, then we have no reason to be outraged at violations of what is nothing but a contract. But we are correctly outraged; this much is indisputable. We are outraged because deep down, we must know that “meaningless” rarely means meaningless.
We cannot have it both ways, where sex is everything and sex is nothing. We ignore the perils of perpetuating this paradox at great cost. This is a world where both accuser and accused tell some part of the truth, where perhaps the encounter meant nothing to one person and everything to the other. This is a world of imperfect justice, where survivors are silenced, and lives destroyed.

Ever since Harvard announced that the 135th Harvard-Yale football game would be held at Fenway Park, students have been expressing their displeasure with the change. Complications with the venue, ticket sales, and the distance between Harvard Square and Fenway Park have unsettled students. Changes to the Game’s famous annual tailgate, though, have perhaps distressed students the most.
Previous iterations of The Game have included a tailgate outside of Harvard Stadium. However, this year Harvard plans on setting up a "FanZone" near Fenway Park open to the public that will include a space where guests can purchase food and beverages. In response, more than 700 Harvard students and affiliates have signed a petition calling for the Harvard-Yale tailgate to be held in the athletics complex in the hours before The Game, as is tradition. Students advocating for a traditional tailgate have argued that, absent a school-wide celebration, many students will instead choose to stay on campus or attend pre-Game festivities in smaller, exclusive social spaces around Cambridge.
We agree that the tailgate is a crucial aspect of The Game. As we have previously opined, the Game is not just an opportunity for the undergraduate community to watch football, but more importantly, a rare opportunity for students from all walks of life to come together and celebrate with friends as a unified student body. As such, we affirm the aim of this petition and urge the College to preserve a tailgate that is inclusive and available to all.
We believe this might be done by renting out a lot near Fenway Park. But if such an arrangement is not possible, Harvard should accept the student demands made in this petition and arrange for a tailgate to be held outside Harvard Stadium as has been done in previous years.
Either way, the College must inform students of its final decision in a timely manner. With The Game just a little over a month away, students and student groups need time to finalize tailgate plans. While it remains to be seen whether Harvard will succeed on the field on Nov. 17 at The Game, it is well within the University’s power to ensure successful tailgate.

Amidst the debate on affirmative action, international students tend to be overlooked. Although it is important to consider students of different ethnic backgrounds within the United States, the College must not forget that international students are equally as important in creating a diverse Harvard community. And I’m not focusing on the international students from high-income families able to afford Harvard’s tuition ― I’m talking about the international students from less-privileged backgrounds who come to America in search of a college education of the highest quality.
During his inaugural address, University President Lawrence S. Bacowexplained that though many international students return to contribute to their home countries, many are also among the most successful and productive members of American society. Harvard, in steadily increasing the international student population, is continuing to make advances in admitting international applicants. Currently, international students make up 12 percent of admitted students in the Class of 2022. Yet there is still much room for improvement: The number of international students are significantly lower in comparison to students with U.S. citizenships. While the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid claims that Harvard does not categorize individual applicants based on whether or not they are applying from the United States, the College does distinguish in its own data based on whether or not applicants hold a US passport.
International students already face more hurdles than their American counterparts. Many have to navigate the nuances of the American college application system without a school counselor that is knowledgeable about the U.S. college application system. They also have to make sure that their application essays are on par with those of American students in demonstrating often-arbitrary qualities such as humor, sensitivity, or courage. Especially if English is not their primary language, the challenge is even more daunting. Even if Harvard actually does not distinguish between domestic and international applicants, disparities in the application material may filter through. International students without the resources of more privileged domestic applicants may lack prestigious awards or have application essays with less-polished sentences on the personal essay.
International students bring much-needed diversity on campus. They truly contribute to classes and College life in general by providing a global perspective. Although they may be slightly slow to pick up on certain aspects of American culture, they still blend in with the rest of the student body, thriving in their areas of interest. Harvard is already a leading institution in the nation in terms of accepting foreign students, and the College should continue to be a pioneer in embracing campus diversity by not only admitting more international students but also creating an accommodating space for non-Americans to settle into college life in a foreign country. In that way, Harvard would be able to create a welcoming environment that is truly conducive to promoting diversity.
What can Harvard do in order to admit more international students? One method is to reduce the number of often-white, legacy “Z-list” students who are admitted from the deferred admissions pool. Harvard should strengthen its commitment to upholding socioeconomic diversity, and admitting international students from low- or middle-income families is an effective way to do so. Before giving the upper hand to high-income, legacy students, Harvard should remind itself of its goals as a globally-influential institution of higher education with a mission to educate the world’s brightest minds. Another method is to use its alumni network to reach talented students from less-privileged backgrounds worldwide. Doing so would give international students a better idea of what Harvard is looking for when selecting students to admit. Moreover, these students may also be able to gain valuable advice on how to prepare a stronger application.
To quote Harvard’s newly elected president, “Over a third of our faculty were born somewhere else. Over a third of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in chemistry, medicine, and physics since 2000 have gone to men and women who were foreign-born. Over 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children.” Harvard’s international students are definitely capable of making positive impacts on the world with their college education. So why not give more foreign students a chance?

M. Adam Howard has had a variety of educational experiences in his life — and the juxtaposition between them sparked his interest in studying elite education. Howard grew up in a low-income household in rural eastern Kentucky and attended Berea College, before receiving a graduate degree at Harvard and teaching at a private school in Cincinnati, Ohio. Now, Howard is a professor of education at Colby College, and one of his specialities is elite schooling and affluent youth. During the hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Howard wrote an article for Vox about the culture of private schools like Georgetown Preparatory School. FM sat down with Howard last week to learn more about his research and how it applies to both Harvard and contemporary politics.
FM: Can you tell me a bit about how you got started researching the connection between hypermasculinity, privilege, and elite institutions?
MAH: I grew up in rural eastern Kentucky in a very poor family, and I went to an undergraduate institution called Berea College. Berea is a school only for poor Appalachians; you actually have to come from poverty to be admitted there. So I spent the first twenty-three years of my life mostly surrounded by peers who came from poverty like me, and so my worldview and my experiences were profoundly shaped by that. But to make a very long story short, I went to graduate school at Harvard—certainly not a school for poor people, as I'm sure you know. That was the first experience I had being around peers who weren’t from the same background as me. After I got my Master's at Harvard I taught at an elite school in Cincinnati, Ohio, and once again I found myself in an incredibly unfamiliar context. I felt like I didn't know what was going on, and because it was so unfamiliar, I wasn't able to be the teacher that I wanted to be, a teacher who was committed to issues of social justice and helping my students think critically about the world. I had discovered that their worldviews were drastically different from my own, and I needed to understand their worlds much better than I did. So I started researching. I turned to research as a private school teacher in order to understand that world… and that led me to focus on the culture of these types of schools and the lessons that students learned from their education through these institutions.
FM: I know a lot of your research has used ethnography as a tool. Given your experience coming from a background very different from many of the places that you ended up researching, how did you gain access to these hypermale, seemingly exclusive spaces?
MAH: (laughs) It remains a mystery to me, and I haven’t always been successful. My first research site was an elite school in the Northeast. I had full access, in part because I was connected to another elite institution at that time, so the people there had certain assumptions about my background and why I was there. But one day the headmaster was having a casual conversation with me to check in about my research, and he asked me what high school I had attended. I told him the truth: Bardstown High School. “Is that a public school?” he asked in reply. In that moment, I had no choice but to reveal a bit about my background coming from poverty, and there was this look on his face that said ‘“Oh no; we’ve let someone in who never should have been able to have this much access.” They didn’t kick me out formally, but after that day literally no one would talk to me to the point where I had to leave that research site. I realized then that access meant two things: first, getting into the place physically, but then once you're there, having access to the information that they don't typically tell people, the information that outsiders don't know. I learned a lot from that experience about how to frame my own educational background and present my experiences in ways that wouldn't make me seem like a threat but not in ways where I'm dishonest. But the other part is that I’m genuinely interested in using my research to help people, using my research to change and improve these institutions. A lot of people who study these schools argue that they shouldn't exist. That has not been my position. I believe that there's a lot of good in what these schools are trying to accomplish, and so I look for ways that my research can contribute to helping them realize their goals more fully.
FM: Following up on that, I think when you look at a lot of these elite institutions today, whether via affirmative action on the college and university level or A Better Chance programs in a lot of boarding schools, it seems like a lot of them are trying to diversify their student base. From your perspective, how effective has that been at changing the culture of privilege?
MAH: I don't think it's been effective at all. This has been one of the areas that I have focused on in my research. Though these institutions are seemingly more diverse, the overall culture has not changed. We need to question what diversity means in this context: what do the schools mean when they claim that they’ve become more diverse? They’ve become more diverse with respect to gender—many all male schools have begun to accept women—and some have become more diverse with respect to race. But they certainly haven't become more diverse as far as social class is concerned. In most cases, even though they look different demographically, they haven't changed beneath the surface. Cookson and Persell published a book called “Preparing for Power,” and it’s generally considered one of the most important studies of elite schools in the United States. And in 2010 they did a research follow up and came to the conclusion that what was true in 1985 when they first published their work remains true in 2010, which is quite remarkable—even with all the changes occuring in the wider world, these institutions haven’t changed. For that reason, a lot of us believe that part of the reason why they’ve become more more diverse is because it’s necessary for them to maintain their elite status. I firmly believe that diversity is another way that elite institutions have legitimized their elite status and legitimized remaining the same in fundamental ways despite a changing world.
AWDA: I suppose related to that, some of your research posits that there's a connection between the exclusivity and the prestige of these elite institutions and the pressure to keep negative incidents, sexual assault for example, hidden from view. Can you explain how that connection functions and how it developed?
MAH: For these institutions, remaining elite means remaining exclusive. They have to remain a closed community, since the threat of public scrutiny is a threat to their institution’s exclusivity. so that's one part of it. But the other part of this is that in order for them to remain elite and all that goes along with that, they have to uphold a positive image and project that positive image. In many ways they have to have permission from everyone else in order to maintain their power and status, so they work very hard to constantly legitimize themselves. When anything negative comes to the surface, it threatens that image.
FM: Turning now to Thursday's testimony, from your research, what do you make of Judge Kavanaugh's characterization of his high school years—his fixation with being number one in his class, lifting weights, sports, beer—what does that tell you about what he was like while in high school?
MAH: There are a couple of things that we can draw from what he said. First, this emphasis on perfection in and outside the classroom is common among elite schools. Not only do you have to be a good student, you also have to be a good athlete too, so you spend a lot of time practicing and working out. You also need to be the best at whatever club you’re involved in. One of the things I’ve examined is the way in which hierarchies are imposed within these elite environments, meaning that in every situation, in every context, there is a winner and therefore there is a loser. These elite schools teach their students to be winners, and a lot of their lives become focused on training to be a winner—and there are consequences to that. For one, there’s a widespread culture of working hard and partying hard. Due to the amount of pressure placed on students to be perfect, we see the emergence of excessive behaviors. And when they’re partying, we see the lessons they’ve learned in school applied: this win at all costs mentality bleeds into the ways they interact with their peers, even in informal contexts.
FM: Thinking about the way that this culture shapes someone who's part of those institutions, many of the people who jump to judge Kavanaugh's defense argue that the Kavanaugh of today differs completely from the Brett Kavanaugh of Georgetown Prep or Yale. From your research and the schools that you've studied, do the hyper-masculine, elite spaces where you see this work hard/party hard dynamic continue to shape one's outlook even after they graduate and move on?
MAH:Absolutely! These lessons that they've been learning about hypermasculinity, about hyper competitiveness, are lifelong lessons. These are formative years, and these students are learning how to interact with others and are developing incredibly powerful understandings of themselves and the world around them that they carry with them for their entire lives. Many of these students are a part of an elite circuit: they attend elite prep schools, move on to elite universities, and then take up elite, powerful jobs. Which lessons are reinforced at each of those stages as they go through life?
FM: What are those lessons, and how are they reinforced?
MAH: One of the most profound and most important lessons is that hierarchies are not only natural, they're necessary. That organizes one's life in one particular way and makes it so that they go into every situation as if it were a competition. Because of that, their success and everything that goes along with their success comes at the expense of others. This win-at-all-costs attitude encourages people to be successful by whatever means necessary, which can lead to things like deception, dishonesty.
FM: Harvard obviously participates in that circuit of elite institutions that you've mentioned. Is there any change to the culture of those places that could do away with that win-at-all-costs mentality?
MAH: If you look at just about any elite institution—let’s take Kavanaugh’s Georgetown Prep as an example—the mission of the school tends to be all about preparing the students to be compassionate, caring. There’s an emphasis on service to others and community. On the surface, there’s a very official commitment to these positive qualities. Part of what I've tried to do is to say “Okay, let's focus on these positives and figure out how we can do what you say you want to do.” Take for example the emphasis on community. If you're really focused on building a healthy, strong sense of community within your institution, how can you at the same time emphasize competition? That goes against the very basis of a healthy and strong community. I'm hopeful because these places have a stated commitment to these more positive ideas, but they have to sort out the contradictions. They have to realize that they can't say that they want to teach students one thing while other parts of the educational experience emphasize drastically different and entirely contradictory lessons. We also have to recognize that identities are neither constant nor stable. Even when a student arrives at a place like Harvard having been taught lessons about competitiveness for years, they will constantly be shaped and reshaped by their everyday experiences and realities, which means that they can form new understandings, they can be offered new tools that teach them new ways of knowing and doing, ways that don't reinforce privilege. They can be taught alternative lessons about themselves, their place in the world, and their relationship with others, and those lessons can be more aligned with what the schools claim to be teaching. I have faith in that.
FM: In recent years, the Harvard administration has been attempting to curtail unrecognized single-gender social organizations, and beneath the surface, issues of hypermasculinity and the concentration of privilege seem to play a large role in motivating their efforts. What with #metoo having pushed issues of gender-based harassment into the public consciousness and the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh widening that conversation to include the effects of these privileged or single-gender spaces, what do you see as the future of the spaces that you study and these elite institutions?
MAH: All of these moments, all of these movements, represent some of the greatest threats to privilege ever seen. Privilege works because it’s kept invisible, kept hidden. The more that we shine the spotlight on how privilege is reinforced by institutions, the more we can challenge it. We can't challenge privilege unless we talk about it, unless we break the silence. We don't typically do that as a society—we don't talk about privilege often, and the ways in which we do are not very useful, and they don't reveal a complex understanding of how privilege works. If you don't talk about something, there isn't an opportunity for you to develop an understanding of it.

Avocado toast and Tide Pods might infatuate your hip and happenin’ teen, but the Smith Campus Center can barely draw their eyes away from their pesky iPhones.

Well salmonize my shorts and call me a Philadelphia roll, your child might be trying to overthrow the established governing body through violent revolution. The sanctions of our authoritarian administrative overlords have radicalized your teenager. Soon the city… nay, the country will face the wrath of the oppressed. Your teen will usher a wave of chaos, drenching the world in the blood of dissenters, and dominating the survivors as the globe kneels to the world order of single-sex organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman was killed in a truck accident at the corner of Magazine Street and Putnam Avenue Friday.
The Boston Globe reported that an unidentified woman believed to be in her 20s was hit by a tri-axle dump truck in the evening of October 5. At 4:41 p.m. that afternoon, the Cambridge Police Department tweeted that there had been a serious accident. Two hours later, the Middlesex district attorney’s office announced that it would be investigating the crash with Cambridge police. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.
Although the woman has yet to be identified, the neighborhoods around Magazine Street and Putnam Street have honored the woman at the site of the crash.Residents strung flowers around a nearby streetlight, and a makeshift memorial commemorates the place of the accident.
The crash occured within a block of two religious spaces, the Temple Eitz Chayim and the Cambridgeport Baptist Church. Speaking to the Globe, Paul Farwell, Eitz Chayim’s administrator, said that the temple’s congregants were visibly rattled by the accident. Congregants of the Cambridgeport Baptist Church were also affected — according to the Boston Herald, two church employees initiated the flower memorial.
Friday’s accident closely follows another fatality involving pedestrians and bikers on the streets of Cambridge. In September, not far from the site of Friday’s crash, an 80-year-old woman was killed in the parking lot of the Cambridge Housing Authority building.
Additionally, in June 2016, a woman was killed while biking in Inman Square. In March 2015, someone was hit by a container truck near the Whole Foods on Putnam Avenue. After the fatal bike crash in 2016, many Cambridge residents said the congested streets were contributing to an unsafe and accident-prone environment.
The City of Cambridge and Harvard have both made efforts in recent years to increase safety for walkers and bikers. In February, Harvard announced a truck safety initiative that would install side guards on University-owned trucks to keep people from getting swept underneath them. Earlier in the same month, the speed limit in Harvard Square was lowered for the second time in less than two years from 25 to 20 miles per hour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Breaking weeks of near-silence on newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 sent a five-paragraph email to school affiliates Monday calling the past few weeks an “extraordinarily painful and divisive chapter” of American history.
“I care deeply about our students,” Manning wrote in the email. But he repeated his refusal to take a public position on the judge’s confirmation.
“When I speak out as dean, I am understood to be taking a position on behalf of our Law School,” he wrote. “But Harvard Law School is a large, diverse community that does not speak with one voice, and I cannot speak for all of you.”
Manning also acknowledged that the confirmation process raised numerous questions about the “role and direction” of the Supreme Court as well as how society addresses issues of sexual assault and harassment.
Kavanaugh’s confirmation Saturday came after at least three women publicly accused the Trump-nominated judge of sexual misconduct — and after an emotional and nationally televised hearing in which Kavanaugh accused Democrats of producing the allegations as part of a plot to block his nomination. In the wake of that hearing, some legislators and legal experts said they were concerned that Kavanaugh is too partisan to sit on the nation’s highest court.
“As we work to define, and seek answers to, those questions, I hope we can all agree on this: Harvard Law School is and must be a place of deep inquiry, a place of intellectual and personal bravery, and—at its best—a place where we listen generously to one another as we commit ourselves to addressing the serious and important questions that are before us,” Manning wrote.
The email to Law School affiliates did not mention Kavanaugh’s time teaching at Harvard, where he has served as a visiting lecturer for more than a decade. It also did not mention the recent push by some students and alumni to remove Kavanaugh from his teaching position.
The Law School announced last week that Kavanaugh would not return to teach his course, titled the “Supreme Court Since 2005,” in January 2019. University President Lawrence S. Bacow later said Kavanaugh chose to leave his teaching position at Harvard Law School of his own volition.
Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford was the first woman to step forward with allegations that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault, telling the Washington Post that the justice tried to rape her at a party both attended in D.C. in the 1980s. Ford repeated these allegations in vivid detail during the nationally televised hearing Sept. 27.
Deborah Ramirez — a former classmate of Kavanaugh’s at Yale College — came forward with her own allegations of sexaul assault soon after Ford went public. Ramirez told the New Yorker Kavanaugh pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while freshmen in college. A third woman, Julie Swetnick, later issued a sworn statement asserting that she saw Kavanaugh engage in “inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s.”
Kavanaugh repeatedly and strongly denied all of these allegations.
With the exception of an email he sent to students on Sept. 28 insisting he could not “comment on personnel matters” — in reference to calls for Kavanaugh's teaching position to be terminated — Manning has remained silent on Kavanaugh since the three women stepped forward.
By contrast, Heather K. Gerken, the dean of Yale Law School, has been outspoken regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct. In a brief statement posted to a Yale website on Sept. 28, Gerken joined the American Bar Association in calling for an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, who is an alumnus of both Yale College and Yale Law School.
Manning closed out his Monday missive by writing he feels “grateful to the many members of our community who have shared with me what they are experiencing in these challenging times.”
“If you or someone close to you is hurting or struggling, we are here to support you,” he wrote.
The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on Saturday in a close 50-48 vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview last week that she is actively recruiting faculty who study race and ethnicity.
Her support for these disciplines comes as students and alumni continue to call for Harvard to further develop its programs in ethnic studies. Though Gay did not explicitly outline what a formal program in the field might look like in FAS, she said she believes the best way to strengthen any future programs is to start by building up the faculty.
“What really needs to come first are the faculty — the faculty who will come here, who will develop the curriculum and who eventually will provide the leadership that will bring the curriculum together and make it sustainable as a program in whatever form,” Gay said.
Activists have long advocated for a formalized program in ethnic studies. Their efforts have spanned more than 40 years and have included 12 different proposals calling on Harvard to invest in the field.
As a committee searched for a new FAS dean over the summer, ethnic studies advocates sent an open letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in June, encouraging him to select a leader for Harvard’s largest division who would prioritize the field of ethnic studies. Nearly 50 Harvard student and alumni organizations, who collectively call themselves the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, signed the open letter, and the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance sent its own follow-up letter to Bacow.
FAS currently offers a secondary field in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, but no field of concentration for undergraduates at the College. The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, which oversees the secondary field, also allows undergraduates to pursue a secondary track in Latino Studies. Independently, History and Literature allows its students to focus on ethnic studies as a possible field within the concentration.
The coalition’s June letter criticized the current opportunities in specific History and Literature topics, calling them “poorly supported” and “under-resourced.” Among the problems cited in the letter were the lack of courses in Asian American studies, Arab American studies, and mixed race studies in the History and Literature department offerings in fall 2017.
At the time of the letter’s receipt, FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that FAS is currently working to expand its course offerings in “fields of priority to EMR and the ethnic studies track in Hist & Lit.”
FAS has already proven successful in its efforts to recruit faculty, according to Gay. She said the recent hiring of History Professor Philip J. Deloria, Harvard’s first-ever tenured faculty member in Native American studies, was an example of the progress FAS has made thus far.
“There's definitely more work to do, but I'm feeling pretty optimistic because of what we've managed to achieve, frankly, just in the last 18 months,” Gay said. “These are folks who are energized, have great ideas, outside perspective, and I could imagine continuing to build a cohort around this nucleus.”
Gay said that as dean of social science — a role she held immediately prior to assuming the FAS deanship — she authorized several faculty searches for professors studying race and ethnicity. Gay, who herself is a professor of Government and African and African-American Studies, co-taught the graduate seminar Government 2576: “Racial and Ethnic Politics in the United States.” Now, she said she is waiting to see how the faculty searches pan out before having further discussions on what type of “program” of ethnic studies FAS will create.
“I have the structural authority to create an ethnic studies program like tomorrow, but I'm not going to be the one teaching it and advising the students in it, because I'm sitting in this office,” Gay said. “That's the reason I'm starting with faculty. Once we get that cohort here, then they can start talking amongst themselves about how they want to organize themselves, how they want to organize their curriculum.”
Gay said she plans to revisit the topic in the spring and meet with ethnic studies proponents then, after the faculty searches have progressed.
“By the spring, we'll have some sense of how those faculty searches are doing, and hopefully we'll have identified the candidates, the new faculty that will be joining us,” Gay said. “So I thought from that perspective, the conversation will be much more productive then as opposed to now when the searches are still going on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said faculty and administrators are still gathering information and input about potentially ending the College's semesterly "shopping week" at an Undergraduate Council meeting Monday — and cited several problems that the tradition causes for professors, graduate students, and undergraduates.
The final decision to retain or eliminate shopping week — a Harvard quirk that allows students to sample classes for a week before officially registering — would likely occur with a broader overhaul of the course enrollment process, she said.
Eliminating shopping week would ultimately require a vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and that vote will not happen until FAS conducts further research on possible alternatives, Claybaugh said. The Faculty Council — FAS's highest governing body — voted to approve the creation of a committee to study preregistation at its biweekly meeting Sept. 28.
“If this were purely a question about shopping period, I would not try to change it, because I think that opinion in our community is too divided, and I think the value of tradition is very strong,” Claybaugh said. “But the relevant debate for us is ‘are the benefits of shopping period — whatever those benefits are — are they worth the costs?”
The remarks from Claybaugh, assumed the deanship over the summer, come several months after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences debatedthe merits of shopping week at its monthly meeting last March. On Monday, Claybaugh echoed many of the concerns faculty members expressed during that meeting, including the inability of faculty to adequately plan ahead for their courses amid fluctuating enrollment numbers.
In an interview on Thursday, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said they are concerned with what they have perceived to be a lack of student input in proposed changes to course enrollment.
“I don’t think that the student body has accurately been polled or involved in this conversation up until this point,” Boucher said. “We want to make sure that that representation does happen.”
“Granted,” he added, “it’s still very early.”
Claybaugh also cited the uncertainty that shopping period creates for graduate students looking for teaching jobs. During the first few weeks of each semester, instructors often have to add or eliminate course sections based on the changing number of enrollees.
As a result of late hirings, Claybaugh said, 35 percent of teaching fellows received their first paycheck of last year’s fall semester at least a month late.
“It leads to incredible disruptions in their lives,” Claybaugh said. “They find it unbelievably stressful to go from class to class and try to figure out whether any of them will have an employment opportunity.”
“Our graduate students are very much a part of our community and so a policy that is so damaging to them is a serious problem for all of us,” she added.
In addition, Claybaugh said that although shopping period appears to “enable” student choices, it actually “limits” choices as well, by vastly increasing the number of lotteried classes.
She also noted that because shopping week pushes the undergraduate enrollment date later than most other universities, cheaper — oftentimes used — textbooks, are sometimes no longer available for Harvard undergraduates to purchase.
Multiple UC representatives, however, argued during Monday’s meeting that the drawbacks of shopping week Claybaugh cited havebeen overstated, telling Claybaugh they still harbored concerns about the proposed changes.
“I’ve had TFs who have told me ‘this is not my area of expertise’ and they’ve actually still done a really good job," said Victoria M. Marquez ’20, a Pforzheimer House representative, referring to graduate teaching fellows. “I’ve found that even though they come in unprepared, they’ve been very quick to adapt.”
At Monday’s meeting, the UC also passed legislation to host a town hall on October 16 about shopping week with Claybaugh, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. In addition, the Council’s Education Committee has an ongoing survey to students asking their opinions on proposed changes to shopping week.
Boucher said after the meeting that, although he was “optimistic” about Claybaugh’s efforts to gather student input, he said the administration must ensure that the faculty — the ultimate arbiters on the issue — will take students’ opinions into account, proposing that UC leaders directly present the survey results to the faculty.
“If we would still be in office when the vote takes place, I would push for one of us to speak at the faculty committee and give a report on this data that we’re collecting from the student body,” he said.
In an emailed statement before the meeting, Claybaugh wrote she encouraged students to email her directly to convey their feelings about shopping week.
“We want to hear from as many people as possible, from as many different groups (undergrads, but also grad students, faculty, and staff) as we think through this potential change,” Claybaugh wrote .

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council narrowly failed to pass a bylaws change at its Monday meeting that would have increased the required threshold needed to motion for a roll-call vote from one-fourth to two-thirds of the Council, a change which many representatives contended would have decreased the body’s transparency.
Since the legislation would have altered the Council’s bylaws, it required a two-thirds majority to pass. The legislation failed on Monday as 25 representatives voted in favor and 14 voted against it, though representatives have a week to change their votes, meaning the legislation could pass if at least one Council member switches their opposing vote to one of support.
A roll-call vote entails that each UC representative must state out loud whether they support or oppose a piece of legislation, with their individual votes recorded on the publicly accessible UC website.
“A roll-call vote allows all of us to be held accountable — that is, responsible — for the people that voted to elect us,” Ivy Yard Representative Grey Johnson ’22 said.
UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, who ultimately voted in favor of Monday’s legislation, noted that the anonymous voting system itself was rare in legislative bodies, such as the U.S. Senate.
“Why should we be eliminating roll-call votes if, in reality, the Senate and other comparable institutions where they vote, the votes are not anonymous?” she said. “If we do think we are a representative body, shouldn’t we be held accountable for what we’re voting for?”
Proponents of the legislation argued it would increase the efficiency of the Council and prevent some representatives from intimidating others to vote one way or the other.
“The reason that the Senate does, and we don’t is, because the Senate is the Senate and we’re college students, and I don’t want to be held accountable 20 years from now for something I voted for right now,” Mather House Representative Conner P. Williams ’21 said.
Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said anonymous votes allow representatives to vote how they feel, as opposed to what is “socially acceptable.”
“We’re not representing a very diverse ideological perspective,” Barclay said. “I think we’re representing a college campus that definitely leans heavily one direction.”
“It’s not about accountability,” Barclay added. “Sometimes in these cases I literally feel it’s about safety from harassment on this campus.”
Certain types of legislation — including constitutional amendments and changes to bylaws — will still require a roll-call vote, as mandated by the constitution.
The vote to increase the threshold to motion for a roll-call vote comes just months after the UC adopted an anonymous voting system for most pieces of legislation, replacing hand and voice votes, which theoretically gave outside observers — including reporters — the ability to identify how each representative voted.
At the time, some UC members said they supported the change to anonymous voting because it allowed representatives in the minority to feel comfortable voting their consciences.
The UC also voted on Monday to allocate $3,000 to help fund a concentration declaration event for sophomores in early November. The Harvard Alumni Association, and the College’s Advising Programs Office and Dean of Students Office, have also tentatively agreed to fund the event, which will feature food, drinks, a photo booth, and music.
The legislation will help the Council at least partly address a referendum question the student body passed last November requesting more funding for class-wide programming events for sophomores and juniors.
Last year, no class-wide declaration event was held due to “logistical issues,” said Lowell House Representative Jungyeon Park ’20, who sponsored the legislation. Park noted that although most individual Houses held events for their residents, she said the experience left much to be desired.

In University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office in Massachusetts Hall, the furniture is still rented, the walls still bare, and the photos still unframed.
It’s clear the space is still adjusting to its new occupant, but Bacow’s demeanor suggests he already feels at home. Bacow, who marks his 100th day in office Tuesday, has only just moved into the corner office. He was officially inaugurated Friday in Tercentenary Theatre as the University’s 29th president, a role for which he was chosen in Feb. 2018. The celebration fell three months into Bacow’s tenure — and in those three months, he has already begun advocating for higher education, socializing with students on campus, and absorbing the intricacies of the University’s inner workings.
Throughout American history, “100 days” has marked a critical benchmark for any new leader. Celebrated Harvard alumnus President Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, popularized the term the during the Great Depression, when he pushed through Congress an ambitious plan to right an economically struggling United States in just over three months.
The situation Bacow inherited is not nearly so dire. Harvard just closed out a $9.6 billion capital campaign, saw improvements in its endowment returns this year, and receives more applications for undergraduate admissions each year.
It won’t be all smooth sailing for Bacow, though. Soon after he reaches 100 days in office, a high-profile lawsuitalleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants will go to trial in a Boston courthourse and Harvard will need to shell out money to the federal government to pay an unprecedented tax on its endowment — all that on top of a political climate that is decidedly hostile tohigher education.
Once on the job, Bacow wasted no time getting out into Harvard Yard, greeting freshmen during Opening Daysand helping carry boxes during First-Year Move-In in August.
Harvard’s public relations apparatus ensured his presence was documented; pictures of Bacow and his wife, Adele, popped up across Harvard’s social media outlets. Bacow took selfies with new students, chatted with their parents, and met with first-generation students enrolled in a new pre-orientation program.
An avid runner, Bacow has adopted many new ways of interacting with students, including jogging with them along the Charles River and up to Elmwood, the presidential residence.
“Adele and I enjoy interacting with students,” Bacow said in his first full-length sit-down with The Crimson last month. “One of the things that's been fabulous about spending my entire adult life on a college campus is it's one of the few places where you can work where you get older but the people around you stay the same age and it keeps you young.”
Despite Bacow’s enthusiastic presence at University-organized events, social life remains a contentious topic on Harvard’s campus.
Bacow inherited the College’s controversial penalties against single-gender social organizations when he agreed to take on Harvard's top job. In 2016, tormer University President Drew G. Faust announced the sanctions, which — starting with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
Bacow said in September that the sanctions are here to stay, eliminating any doubts that a change in leadership would mean a change in policy. Bacow emphasized that the sanctions embody the College’s values of inclusion and belonging.
“I’m still, as a new president, getting to know and understand sort of the impact of our policies and how it’s affecting folks,” he added.
In evaluating social life at Harvard, Bacow said many students have told him that the College has “ceded social life to private unregistered organizations,” which, for him, justifies the sanctions against single-gender social groups, many of which own private, off-campus mansions and answer to graduate boards.
“Students have expressed concern about what that’s meant for Harvard,” Bacow said. “So, we’ve tried to be responsive. We will continue to try and be responsive going forward.”
Whether that means more events with thousands of catered lobsters or Mediterranean buffets — like those the College held in the first weeks of September — remains to be seen, but Bacow said he has been looking for “opportunities to engage” and “will continue to do so.” On his list are athletic events, intramurals, and meals in House dining halls.
But even as he’s taken time to socialize with students, Bacow also hasn’t been afraid to assign some homework.
Joining campus organizations, politicians, and celebrities across the country in calling for American citizens to vote in the November midterm elections, Bacow has insisted that students on campus register to cast ballots in the upcoming races.
In his first-ever Convocation address, Bacow asked students to take out their phones and write down an Institute of Politics website that helps students register to vote and request absentee ballots from their home states.
Last week, Bacow took his message to the entire school. In an email to students bearing the subject line “Democracy,” Bacow again urged students to exercise their civic duty.
“In five weeks, Americans will head to the polls for the midterm elections and fulfill the first responsibility of citizenship in a democracy,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow’s message to students regarding civic engagement ties into his efforts to combat the hostile political climate facing higher education.
In his first hundred days, he has followed in the footsteps of his presidential predecessors, making the case for higher education in Washington and around the country.
Public opinion regarding institutions of higher learning has soured in recent years. Colleges and universities have taken several political hits since the start of the Trump administration, including terminations ofprotections for undocumented youth, a Republican-driven tax on university endowments, and criticisms that higher education is not open to all views across the political spectrum.
On top of that, a high-stakes lawsuit filed in 2014 alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants has garnered support from the Department of Justice, which filed an amicus brief in August that supports the plaintiffs’ claims that Harvard engages in illegal racial balancing in its admissions process.
Bacow has staunchly defended higher education and its contributions to the American Dream. He frequently invokes his own immigrant backstory, and says higher education has “power to transform” students’ lives by generating opportunity and jobs across socioeconomic classes. In a recent interview, he emphasized the importance of research in “generating new knowledge” and using that knowledge to “better society.”
“One of the reasons why I’m spending as much time as I am in D.C. and will spend it there but also traveling around the country, engaging in conversations with others, is because I believe so passionately in the mission of higher education,” Bacow said.
Jobs and economic opportunity are the focus of some of Bacow’s initiatives beyond Harvard’s gates. Bacow spearheaded a partnership between Harvard and the University of Michigan last month to address income inequality and the opioid epidemic. A Michigan native, Bacow said he was “delighted” to see Harvard partner with a public research university to address issues he called in a press release “among the most pressing of our time.”
The new partnership wasn’t his only effort to reach beyond New England; he also visited his hometown of Pontiac, Mich. last month to speak to students about college and financial aid opportunities at schools like Harvard. Bacow encouraged students to pursue higher education. He also tried to combat stereotypes that institutions like Harvard only serve coastal elites.
“There’s a perception at least in parts of the country that only people who attend Harvard or only people who live nearby places like Harvard benefit from what we do,” he said in an interview during the trip.
Bacow said he plans to embark on other travels around the country in his quest to combat Harvard’s image problem and change what he considers misperceptions about higher education.
In his inauguration speech, Bacow said it is important that Harvard students recognize they have an obligation to the “public good” and said he hopes all Harvard graduates will be “active, engaged, enlightened citizens.”
Harvard has come under fire in recent years from those who say it doesn’t support students who want to pursue careers in public service.
In his inauguration speech, however, Bacow committed to financially supporting every undergraduate who seeks a summer position in the public sector.
Bacow has already made embracing ideological diversity a cornerstone of his approach to the presidency. In his speech Friday, he invoked critiques that colleges and universities are not “nearly as open” to ideas from across the political spectrum “as we should be.”
“Throughout human history, the people who have done the most to change the world have challenged and overturned conventional wisdom, so we should not be afraid to welcome into our communities those who challenge our thinking,” Bacow said. “In other words, our search for truth must inexplicably be bound up with commitment to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.”
From Harvard’s campus in Longwood to the Kennedy School along JFK Street, the University’s schools have welcomed Bacow with open arms.
At the Kennedy School, where Bacow spent years as a graduate student, posters with the new president's face line the walls of the newly renovated complex.
In an interview Thursday, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said Bacow’s selection marked a particular point of pride for the school, which has never before seen an alumnus assume Harvard’s highest job.
“He knows a lot about Harvard and is committed to Harvard serving the students who come here and serving the broader world that we're a part of and that view of President Bacow fits very well with the mission of the Kennedy School,” Elmendorf said.
Across the river in Longwood, Michelle A. Williams, dean of the School of Public Health, said she was equally “delighted” byBacow’s selection.
“I think he's particularly an amazing president at the right time for the School of Public Health because he embraces the University's engagement in solving big pressing problems in the world globally as well as domestically,” Williams said. “I think it was an inspired choice and it's one that's just right for the University, especially now when higher [education], unfairly gets the label of being elitist.”
Though Bacow has plenty of plans, he said he’s still learning the ropes.
When he was first appointed in February, Bacow told The Crimson he was in “sponge mode” — meaning he would learn as much as he couldabout how to be Harvard’s president in the months before he officially took office.
One hundred days in, Bacow said not much has changed — and he doesn’t expect to stop listening and absorbing information any time soon.
“I continue to be,” he said,“still in sponge mode.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares to face a high-stakes trial in a lawsuit alleging its undergraduate admissions process is discriminatory, a Texas-based group has filed a similar suit against the Harvard Law Review charging the publication illegally uses “race and sex preferences” to select its members.
The lawsuit —filed Saturday in the U.S. District Court in Boston by an organization called Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences —also claims that the Law Review illicitly relies on race and sex preference when choosing articles. If true, these allegations would mean that the Law Review falls in violation of federal statutes Title VI and Title IX.
The Law Review, a prestigious legal journal that counts President Barack Obama as its former leader, did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
The FASORP complaint also names Harvard Law School, the President and Fellows of Harvard College — the University's highest governing board, otherwise known as the Harvard Corporation — and U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as defendants, writing that “federal law prohibits universities from discriminating on account of race or sex.”
Spokespeople for Harvard Law School and Harvard University did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Texas group filed a near-identical lawsuit against the New York University Law Review Saturday.
The Harvard Law Review is a student-run organization “whose primary purpose is to publish a journal of legal scholarship,” according to its website. The publication is wholly independent from the Law School and the articles it publishes are “subjected to a rigorous editorial process.” The Law Review is formally independent from Harvard Law School, according to its website.
The Law Review accepts 48 second- and third-year Law students as staff members each year based on their performance in a writing competition. Twenty students are accepted based solely on the scores they receive in the competition; 10 are chosen based on a combination of their scores and their grades. The remaining 18 editors are selected through “a holistic but anonymous review that takes into account all available information,” according to the Law Review’s website.
FASORP is specifically alleging that the Law Review’s selection process for these 18 additional editors violates Title VI — which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin —and Title IX, which outlaws gender-based discrimination.
In 2013, the Law Review expanded its affirmative action policy to include gender, meaning staffers could consider applicants’ sex during the selection process. The publication — historically male-dominated — elected the most diverse class of editors in its history in 2016 and its first majority-female class in 2017.
FASORP alleges Harvard Law School and Harvard University violate Title VI and Title IX by allowing the Law Review to use race and sex in its selection process. Finally, the lawsuit charges DeVos violates Title VI and Title IX by allowing the University to receive federal funding.
Savannah Law School professor Vinay Harpalani — an expert on affirmative action — said in an interview Monday that, when he was a student on the NYU Law Review, the publication’s selection process resembled that of the Harvard Law Review. Harpalani graduated from NYU Law School in 2009.
Harpalani said NYU Law Review’s manner of choosing editors fell in line with the Grutter v. Bollinger decision in 2003, a landmark Supreme Court case that upheld affirmative action policies at the University of Michigan Law School.
“We were looking for diversity — race, gender, other background experiences all played into that — but it was done perfectly consistent with the Grutter plan,” Harpalani said. “So that’s how NYU Law Review worked.”
Harpalani said he believes that the Grutter precedent should hold true not only for law schools but for law school publications.
“Now of course, Grutter was about admissions at the law school. One would think that should transfer over to activities like this and particularly law reviews where having these diverse perspectives is particularly important,” he said.
The suit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its undergraduate admissions process will go to trial in a court in downtown Boston on Oct. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team topped Cornell in an afternoon game at Jordan Field that featured constant offensive pressure and composed defense from the Crimson.
The 2-0 tilt was Harvard’s fourth consecutive shutout and its sixth this season.The Crimson racked up eighteen shots on the day and only allowed three.
With the win, Harvard (5-4-1, 2-0-1 Ivy) moved into a tie for first place in the conference while Cornell (1-8-1, 0-3-0) remains in the cellar.The Crimson has only suffered one loss at home this season, a 1-0 loss to Maine, and has won its other four matchups at Jordan Field in shutout fashion.
Freshman forward Trinity Thomas netted the game-winner for Harvard with a deft volley into the back of the net in the 49th minute. The sequence began with a throw-in on the left wing that was controlled by captain midfielder Leah Mohammadi.
The senior wheeled on her defender and whipped in a pinpoint cross to Thomas, who punctuated the sequence with a clean dot to the top right corner from ten yards out. The striker held off the Big Red defender on her hip and gave senior opposing keeper Meghan Kennedy no chance to make a save.
The goal was Thomas’s second on the year and her first Ivy League score.
“When it happened, I didn’t really realize it happened until I saw it in the goal, and it just felt good,”the Dallas native said.
Thomas is one of a number of key first-year contributors on the Crimson’s 2018-2019 squad.Seven of Harvard’s twelve goals this season have come from its impressive rookie class, and the youth movement looks poised to lead the team in the years to come.
For now, though, Mohammadi is at the helm.The midfielder from Upland, Calif., paced the Crimson in both goals and shots last year, and she is off to a similarly strong start in the 2018-2019 campaign.
Mohammadi bagged a penalty kick in the 61st minute on Saturday to pad Harvard’s lead, and later in the second half, she nearly did it again, ripping a searing strike from distance to the top of the goal. Kennedy, who led the Ivy League in saves last year, was able to get a hand on it and push it over the bar.
The goal was Mohammadi’s fifth on the year, but the highlight of the day was her assist to Thomas.
“I honestly didn’t see much, but I was like, if I get the ball near the goal, maybe something great will happen,” Mohammadi said.
The Crimson’s on-field chemistry is evident even from the bleachers, which has given the team a multitude of opportunities on the field. However, a recurring theme for the team this season has been an inability to finish chances near the net.
The team only notched two goals against Cornell, but there were several close calls before Harvard finally broke through. Junior midfielder Meg Tveit very nearly punched one in at the end of a quick series of one-touch passes, and it took a heroic goal-line clear by a Big Red defender to prevent the goal.
“In the first half, we were connecting really well, but we didn’t necessarily have that final piece,” said Mohammadi.
Head coach Chris Hamblin echoed that sentiment after the game.
“[We had] a lot of the ball, a lot of chances, but we didn’t create enough quality in the first half,” Hamblinsaid.
On the other end of the field, Cornell managed only one shot on goal on the day, and senior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel handled it easily.The Choate-Rosemary alumna has been a veritable wall of late, and Harvard will certainly look to keep up its dominance on the defensive end.
“If we have the ball, they don’t,” said Hamblin. “When you have possession, you don’t need to defend. We’re doing something right on the defending end, but we’ve got to be more dynamic on the attack.”
The Crimson takes on Boston University next in its last non-conference bout of the season. It will then enter a critical stretch of Ancient Eight play to close out the year, starting with a visit to Brown on October 13th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely is the outcome of a contest fully determined before it begins.
However, in sailing, where positioning behind the line and acceleration to the start are of tremendous importance, the contest can be over before the clock starts.
This weekend, Harvard women’s sailing rose and fell by its starts, finishing fifth overall in a field of 13 teams competing for the Stu Nelson trophy.
However, in the final race of the weekend, a stellar start managed to offset some of the earlier challenges and brought the Division B squad a third place overall finish on the weekend.
“We ended up in fifth after yesterday’s racing, but after today we got a bullet in the only race of the day, which put us ahead by two places, so we went into third place,” said sophomore Emma Jakobson, who sailed in the Division B boat. “We just had a really good start for this race and were able to play the currents pretty well to stay ahead.”
Even in standard conditions, the beginning of a race is hard to perfect.
“It’s a complicated game,” said assistant coach Bern Noack when asked about a race's start. “There’s a countdown, and you can’t be over the line until the countdown hits go, so there’s a lot of preconditioning to set yourself up to accelerate and then hit the line with the go.”
Varying currents make this already challenging facet of racing particularly difficult. The Stu Nelson regatta, hosted by Connecticut College, is held on the Thames River, which brings a combination of upriver and downriver sailing — and plenty of changing currents. When boats reach the end of the course, they turn around and double back, forcing the sailors to quickly adjust their steering styles.
“In different areas of the water, the water was moving in different directions,” Jakobson said, “so you had to be very aware of where you were on the course, and the way the current was going so that you could sail in the proper current.”
Changing currents also place an even greater importance on the start.
“If you have a currents-affected race course, a lot of times there’s sort of one pathway that’s optimal to go up the race course,” said Noack. “If you don’t have a good start, it’s really hard to pass anyone because everyone’s sailing up the same part of the race course.”
The Crimson had a promising open to the regatta, with the Division A boat of senior Taylor Gavula and sophomore Emily Wang winning the third match. However, Harvard encountered some difficulties with starts by the middle of Saturday, hitting 10th for Division A and 11th for Division B during the fourth round of the regatta.
As the regatta progressed, Harvard felt out a better sense of how to start and where to sail. Only two rounds after taking spots 10 and 11, the Crimson managed a win for both boats in the sixth round.
The Division B team of Jakobson and freshman Anna Kaneti went on to notch another win in what turned out to be the only race of a light-winded Sunday, securing a third place finish for Division B and a fifth place overall finish for the weekend.
Harvard women’s sailing returns to action next weekend on October 14 for the Women's Showcase Finals at Brown.
“[It’s] the biggest women’s [sailing] event of the fall,” said Noack. “It’s probably the 18 best women’s teams in the country next weeked. So that’ll actually be a really good mark for where all the teams are at right now.”
Jakobson is also looking forward to the next race.
“We got our new fleet of D420s, so that’ll be good practicing in those this week to prepare for the weekend,” the sophomore sailor said.

At the Yale Invitational, Harvard women’s golf culminated its weekend in sixth place of 17 teams at the challenging Course at Yale. The team finished53 strokes over par and 15 strokes off the pace set by the winner, Boston University. The Crimson finished strong on Sunday, needing a combined 298 strokes to close out the day. It was the only time this weekend that the Harvard women, who finished the 54-hole tournament with a total score of 905 points, required fewer than 300 strokes.
The sixth-place finish came after the Crimson notched second and fourth place showings in its first two tournaments. Especially important to 14th-year Harvard coach Kevin Rhoades is the fact that the Crimson placed second out of four Ivy League schools at the Invitational —the team was six strokes behind Penn but 13 and 14 strokes ahead of Yale and Brown, respectively.
“The team played well this weekend,” said captain Michelle Xie, a first-team All-Ivy League and 2018 Spring Academic All-Ivy Leaguer. “We’re progressing in the right direction and I think we’re setting ourselves up great for the rest of the season.”
Freshman Anina Ku continued her consistent golfing, leading Harvard with a +4 finish on the weekend after she ended the Crimson’s first two tournaments three and five strokes over par. She placed sixth out of 95 golfers who took part in the tournament, making this her third top-12 finish in three tournaments.
Sophomore Belinda Hu, an Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Year last year, also drove the ball well all three days in New Haven, joining Ku among the top-20 golfers at Yale. She carded 76s on both Friday and Saturday and a 75 on Sunday. That made her one of just 12 golfers at Yale to finish no worse than +5 on any of the three days of the tournament.
It was an exceedingly difficult course all-around, as evidenced by the fact that the Terriers finished 38 shots above par on the weekend and still beat the rest of the field by five strokes. Just two individual golfers, Hanako Kawasaki of Boston University and Kaitleen Shee of St. John’s, finished the tournament under par.
“There’s a lot of elevation changes, and we had some interesting wind as well,” Xie said. “They had some tricky greens to read, and they played the course a little longer this year than they have traditionally so it was a little different even for returning players.”
Round one proved to be a challenge for freshman Chloe Royston and sophomore Jessica Luo, who ended the day at 15 and 14 strokes above par, respectively. But both Royston and Luo improved markedly as the tournament went on, and the pair ended the weekend tied at 28 strokes over par, good for a tie for 56th overall.
“The greens are a bit difficult, but as the week went along we learnt about them more and were able to play better, I think,” Royston said. The South Africa native added that she felt very lucky to play on such a “stunning course.”
For the first time this season, Harvard golfed without standout freshman Elizabeth Wang. The San Marino, Calif., native surged up the World Amateur Golf Ranking last week, moving from No. 84 to No. 59 among women’s amateur golfers. After she finished as the third and fifth best golfers in the entire field in tournaments at Dartmouth and Princeton, she missed out on the Yale Invitational and will be eager to secure a spot on the team for the Crimson’s next tournament.
The Yale Invitational was the third of Harvard’s four fall tournaments, following trips in September to Dartmouth and Princeton and preceding a tournament in Stanford in two weeks. The Crimson will look to build off of its strong foundation in Stanford and then in the spring season, when it will seek to reassert itself as the best women’s golf program in the Ivy League following consecutive Ancient Eight championships for Princeton.
“This was a very productive tournament, and I think we’re a great team this year,” said Royston when asked what she thought of Harvard’s chances in the Ivy League next spring. “It’s difficult to say at this stage but I think we’re doing quite well.”

Coming off of a successful 3-0 trip last weekend, Harvard men's water polo had high hopes for three wins against Brown, Princeton, and MIT at Blodgett Pool.
The Crimson (13-4, 5-1 NEWPC) took two out of three matches from the weekend, but registered its first conference loss of the season, dropping an 11-9 match to the visitors from Providence.
The opening game of the weekend against Brown (11-7, 4-2 NEWPC) started slowly, with the first quarter ending 1-1. With goals from senior Nathan Ondracek, junior Austin Sechrest, and sophomore Dennis Blyashov, the Crimson was able to exit the first half leading 6-5. In the second half, however, the Bears quickly rallied with four goals, and despite a final tally by senior Nick Bunn, Harvard was unable to defeat Brown, losing 11-9.
Head Coach Ted Minnis stated that although the team opened up flat in the morning while struggling with a few defensive help sequences, the team moved on from the loss, ready to rebound against the Tigers.
Both Princeton (10-6, 3-4 NEWPC) and the Crimson started the second game with strong defensive efforts, only allowing two goals cumulatively. An assist from freshman goalkeeper Noah Hodge to Ondracek and a score from Blyashov capped the first half for Harvard, giving the hosts a 6-3 lead.
In the second half, the Crimson and Tigers rallied back and forth, with goals scored by Ondracek and Princeton’s Matt Payne. A strong defensive effort in the fourth quarter which left Princeton scoreless in the last four and a half minutes of play led to an important 9-8 victory for Harvard.
“Princeton was a huge bounce back for us but we’re going to have to fine tune a few things before we play Brown again,” junior Charlie Owens said.
After splitting Saturday’s two contests, the Crimson came into Sunday determined to close out the weekend 2-1. The first quarter against the Engineers (5-9, 1-5 NEWPC) displayed both team’s offensive prowess. Scores from Owens and Ondracek helped Harvard equalize the game 4-4 by the end of the quarter.
Winning the swim off in the second, the Crimson executed hard presses and crashes on set, allowing the team to open an 11-5 lead. However, the Engineers quickly scored three goals off of fast breaks to narrow the halftime deficit to 12-8.
In the third quarter, goalkeeper Hodge started off strongly with a succession of key blocks. Harvard maintained its lead with contributions from Owens and Bunn. A final drive into set at the end of the third, in which Ondracek dished the ball to Sechrest, put the Crimson up 16-11.
The back and forth action continued between the two teams, until two scores from Ondracek and freshman Alex Tsotadze put the game away. Harvard was able to drain the clock, and cruise to a 19-15 victory.
“When you get to the end of the game like that, you can put a dagger away. For the team, it’s a little boost of energy,” Ondracek said. “Regardless, our primary focus was defense so it was a bit of letdown having been scored on by 15. We try to keep every team under 10, so if we can score 19 goals and keep others below 10, we’re sitting in a good spot.”
Overall, Minnis was confident about the team’s success.
“I thought it was team effort all weekend long,” Minnis said. “That’s something we’ve been doing all year long with our depth. We’re playing six people off the bench, and I think that’s one of our strengths and was really proud with the way the group played and responded all weekend.”
The Crimson will host the Harvard Invite facing Claremont-M-S, Bucknell, Wagner, and Toronto beginning Friday, Oct.12 at 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With under 20 minutes left in the match at Jordan Field, the ball fell to a Cornell player at the top of his offensive box. He immediately let loose a shot, one that seemed destined to nestle into the top corner, but Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Matt Freese had other ideas.
Freese’s acrobatic leap and outstretched fingertips allowed him to deflect the shot off the crossbar. However, the ball bounced back into play and Big Red sophomore forward Charles Touche was the first to react, pouncing on the opportunity and heading the ball into the net to complete his hat trick.
This moment captured the spirit of Saturday’s contest between the Crimson (3-7-0, 1-1-0 Ivy) and Cornell (8-2-0, 2-0-0). Harvard put up a fight for the full 90 minutes, yet the nationally ranked Big Red team always seemed to be one step ahead, imposing its will on the game and earning a 4-2 victory.
“They came out with a tenacity that superseded ours,” said Crimson senior forward Cesar Farias. “They are a great side, but like I said, it came down to a matter of grit, not necessarily soccer, and they just brought more of it.”
This intensity was evident early on as several physical challenges by Cornell set the tone and reminded Harvard what team it was playing. The Big Red was quickly rewarded for its fast start with a set piece on its left wing in the ninth minute. As the ball was swung in, a sea of red shirts was there to meet it, and Touche was the one to steer it past Freese with his head to open the scoring.
The first half was going Cornell’s way until the 38th minute when the Crimson was able to capitalize on a mistake. After defending a set piece in its defensive third, Harvard quickly went the other way, springing into a counter attack.
A Big Red defender snuffed out the danger but his poor clearance popped the ball up into the air. Having just been subbed on a few minutes earlier, Crimson freshman forward Nico Garcia-Morillo gathered up the ball and slotted it past the goalkeeper to even it up at 1-1.
This goal galvanized Harvard, as the hosts finished the half with much more energy and confidence than before. The two sides were fighting neck and neck, but it only took three minutes in the second half for Cornell to separate itself again.
A solo effort by Touche on the left wing proved to be successful. He took on his defender with pace, cut in on his right foot, and found the back of the net to add his second goal of the game. 25 minutes later he would complete his hat trick, leaving things looking gloomy for the Crimson at 3-1.
Nevertheless, the game was far from over. Harvard became much more aggressive as it was forced to take risks to get back into the game.
“We were playing it back a little too much instead of playing it forward and getting it into our attacking players,” said Crimson head coach Pieter Lehrer. “So at the end we were more urgent to get forward and had chances, maybe the two best chances of the game, and you know, sometimes they go in and sometimes they don’t.”
Garcia-Morillo, a bright spot for Harvard on the day, would help convert one of these chances in the 83rd minute. He cut the ball back to freshman forward Alfred Perez inside the box. Perez, who found himself with enough time and space, finished it off to breathe some life back into the Crimson.
The hope for a comeback was short lived as less than a minute later the Big Red won a penalty kick. Sophomore midfielder Harry Fuller stepped up for Cornell and calmly converted the spot kick to increase the lead to 4-2, which is how the game would conclude.
The Big Red proved its class with a dangerous combination of skill and tenacity, showing why it entered the contest ranked as it was. Harvard, meanwhile, earned its first conference loss of the season, reminding the team of the work ahead.
“Our time on the field is short… we have half the season left and it’s time to turn it up, all or nothing,” Farias said.

Looking for a beanbag, couch, or the feeling of the sun beating down on you as you study (or at least pretend to study)? Walk over to the new Smith Campus Center and soak in the ~study vibez~. Here we recount the Center’s biggest draws:
The Great Outdoors
If you want to brave the cold Cambridge winter that is quickly approaching, head outside and away from the convenience of electrical outlets to hear the wind blowing and the birds chirping.
For extra bonus points and a nice view, take the stairs off the main lobby to the outdoor patio space.
Pretending You’re in the Great Outdoors
There are random but very aesthetically pleasing and totally instaworthy plant walls that you can sit by on the first floor if you want a semblance of fresh air. If you’re looking for the best rainy day study spot, head to the second floor of the Commons where the glass ceiling creates the perfect ambiance for grinding away on your psets.
A vault. No joke. A literal vault.
For all the ec bros out there who may want to get in the study mood by locking themselves in a bank vault, Smith has the perfect place for you. Cozy up with your pset group and lock yourselves in for a fun night.
For the Views
The tenth floor views give you a glimpse of the city that you will never actually get to explore because you’re stuck studying. But, if you do want to take a break, the pool tables and foosball tables here should be good distractions.
When You Want to Take a Nap
The optimal napping spots are either the 10th floor giant blue couches, or the couches in the “Collaborative Commons.” Insider scoop: the comfiest couch here is the yellow one on the left.
The Actual Best Place to Study at Smith: “Collaborative Commons”
Looking for a less depressing Lamont? Head to arguably the most functional space at the SCC — the Collaborative Commons. This place has a mix of everything you want: desks, comfy couches, and conference rooms. The glass walls also make it a great place to people-watch and crank out essays at 3 a.m. But most importantly, this place has spinny chairs! No late night study sesh is complete without a spin on one of these bad boys.

Harvard’s efforts at trying to make studying an “intellectual, cultural, and social” experience with an “abundance of natural light,” come to light at the SCC — a place where it’s acceptable to take your shoes off and study. Thanks, Harvard, for giving us the hottest new multimillion dollar study spot.
