After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t quite sound right. Every time I introduce myself to people here, I feel as if I’m purposely forgetting an essential part of me. As if my mouth is betraying the rest of my being. 
Coming to college is about starting anew and taking the opportunity to recreate yourself while remaining true to who you are. Before I arrived here, I promised to be boldly unapologetic about my identity: Christian, woman, black, and African all at the same time. Yet, I feel as if I’m not completely being true to that promise when I tell people my name.
My first name, of Nigerian descent, means Love of God. It is representative of the trials my parents were going through when I was born. Names with that much history, that much meaning and weight, shouldn’t be treated lightly. But after seeing the difficulty it presented people, I almost resented it a little. I used to think it wasn’t aesthetically pleasing; it did not have catchy initials; its letters did not look pretty when written. When I was younger, I decided I would change my name as an adult. Being a bearer of many names, given by multiple family members, is typical for Nigerian people. But, I was one of those who hadn’t also been given an English name. Watching my parents change their names when they were officially sworn in as U.S. citizens made me think that was eventually what I would have to do.
By the time I reached high school, I was tired. My name had passed through too many lips that were all too careless with it. I felt as if it had lost its magic. Too many adults had stumbled across its letters, after apologizing for the train-wreck that was about to come out of their mouths. They left in their wake a mangled version of me, trying to conform itself to more palatable English standards. My name quickly became the obstacle that I had to get through every time I met someone new.
Even my longtime friends, after witnessing others’ failed attempts, would ask me again how to say my name, wanting to confirm that their version was right. I never knew how to tell them that they had never had it right in the first place. My response instead was to tell them I didn’t care. At that point, as long as people weren’t blatantly making a mockery of my name, they could call me whatever was easiest for them. As if my name were meant to be a convenience.
I am ashamed to say that in college it hasn’t been much different. But now, I am not so much angry as I am expectant. I used to cringe as I heard the pause while the speaker did attendance, followed by the perplexed and, at times, apologetic face. It was a relief when I could catch them in that moment and introduce myself first, before they had a chance to ruin it. After all, I’d surely pronounce their typical English or American names without hesitation, regardless of their “unique” or “original” spellings.
Popular culture dictates what becomes familiar. The books Americans read and movies they watch feature people with English names, while if someone with a culturally distinct name is even present in these mediums, their name is usually made to be a joke or to portray some negative stereotype. Consequently, this sends the message that these names, and by extension the people that own them, don’t matter. There is no obligation to better know or even have respect for a name like mine, a name that is usually crucial to cultural identity.
This may seem inconsequential to some, especially those who have no cultural or historical attachments or even family ties to their names. For most of us who weren’t born here, though, our names serve as a tangible reminder of our foreign backgrounds. Every time someone mispronounces my name, it becomes even more apparent that I am an outsider. If America is really this cultural mixing pot some may or may not appreciate, shouldn’t we all care to check our multicultural knowledge or lack thereof? Simply because, it is this great diversity that is truly representative of the America we live in today, a land of immigrants.
There is power in the utterance of a name, and the beauty in mine is something I have never forgotten. Taking the time and having the patience to work through its pronunciation with people, only to have them continue to say it wrong or make some rude joke, almost stripped that away from me. But what I call myself is the most palpable part of the core of my identity, and it anchors me in the struggle of being both Nigerian and American. I have long stopped wishing to change my name, but passively allowing it to be pronounced incorrectly is no better. I can no longer accept that my name isn’t just as important as anyone else's in the diverse makeup of this nation.

In a laudable response to concentrators’ input, the History and Literature department has moved to increase the flexibility of students’ potential courses of study, now allowing students to bind their studies to a time period rather than only to a region. By virtue of this change, concentrators will no longer need to perform academic acrobatics to satisfy concentration requirements all the while, but instead will be able to firmly anchor their concentration in their true intellectual interests.
It is crucial to note that these alternative options do not come at the expense of rigor. Each concentrator has an advisor who offers personalized help in seeking out a course of study that is both intriguing and challenging. Furthermore, modifying the History and Literature concentration along such a basic axis as allowing students to study a time period hardly revolutionizes it, but rather gives students more room to explore topics creatively. In short, there is no apparent downside to this change.
We often complain when administrators fail to take student requests into account, but this change is a welcome example of the opposite phenomenon: Rather than maintaining rigid requirements for the sake of consistency alone, the History and Literature department responded to student input and made a common-sense change that gives students critical academic flexibility. This decision making process was both effective and organic, and it represents an ideal for which other departments should strive.
This change to the History and Literature requirements is not the only area in which administrators would benefit from listening to students on academic issues. Students and faculty alike have called for the creation of more robust academic programs in Asian American and Latin American studies. While we understand the many difficulties of establishing new academic committees and departments—such as hiring faculty and recruiting graduate students—increasing the reach of Harvard’s scholarship is important. Current efforts should continue to gather strength as professors offer more courses in the fields to gauge student interest.
These considerations lead to a more general notion: Harvard should continue to sponsor disciplines and concentrations not only for their traditional value or place in academia, but also for their value in the eyes of the students who know their own interests better than anyone else. This is not to say that Harvard or universities at large should dispense with their great traditions, but rather to say that the preservation of traditions should not undercut the development of new disciplines. Given that Harvard advertises itself as a liberal arts institution where students can choose to study subjects that pique their interest, responsiveness to students’ needs is indispensable.
Ultimately, any discipline, no matter its age, must constantly change to meet the needs of its students. After all, even History and Literature, Harvard’s oldest concentration, continues to model such evolution to this day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It sometimes seems that people only ascribe influence to mainstream media whenever they wish to admonish it. So it goes nowadays, where a modish new theory blaming the media for Donald Trump’s improbable and inexorable rise has started to hold sway.
On Monday, President Obama delivered a gentle chiding to a gathered crowd of political journalists, who, in his words, have been missing substance in order to “fill the void and feed the beast with instant commentary and Twitter rumors.” Just the day before, Nicholas Kristof offered his self-flagellation blaming the usual suspects: initial dismissal of The Donald as a living laugh line, followed by lavish airtime and little fact checking.
To be sure, there are some claims that I am sympathetic to: Granting Trump an unprecedented number of phone interviews, 29 on the flagship Sunday talk shows since his campaign began, was, almost certainly, shameful deference to the campaign’s requests prompted by tantalizing ratings boosts. And we could all do better with more aggressive interviews and fact-checks.
But the albatross ought not to be hung around the media’s neck just yet. First, exit polls show that Trump has triumphed due to significant support from disaffected, lower-income, and less-educated whites—a crowd that I’d speculate isn’t terribly influenced by Politico, the New York Times’s editorial page, and even CNN. Instead, critics are mistaking the chicken for the egg. Media coverage of Trump did not manufacture his meteoric rise in the polls so much as his enduring populism forced media to cover him.
Second, even if one assumed that mass media do have an effect on Republican primary voters, it seems dubious to claim that Trump’s “earned media advantage” was actually so advantageous. A favorite analysis of the blame-the-media brigade calculates that Trump has earned $1.9 billion in “free media.” Though this number seems highly inflated (remember that the Obama and Romney campaigns drew $2 billion total in the last election), it also ignores the crucial distinction between positive and negative mentions.
From the dawn of his campaign, many of Trump’s miscues have been covered by mainstream press in excruciating detail, but never flatteringly: his mocking of John McCain, condoning violence at campaign rallies, participating in an extremity-measuring contest with Marco Rubio, having his campaign manager charged for allegedly assaulting a Breitbart reporter, endorsing torture, among many, many others. The media isn’t the problem here—primary voters simply don’t care about Trump’s antics, no matter how unconventional and crude.
Here again, I worry that hasty critics note the sharp upticks in support and media coverage, and conclude causality without much of a second thought. By the same token, Bernie Sanders’ success must be due to media mentions, even though his title may as well be socialist rather than senator.
Candid and unprompted admissions of error are, of course, a sorely-missed feature among the punditocracy, where outlandish predictions without risk of future reckoning have become something of a lucrative profession. But one shouldn’t carry the cross too quickly—and denounce one's companions as “lap dogs, not watchdogs” with too much haste—without due consideration.
Put simply, the reason people are voting for Donald Trump is that people want to vote for Donald Trump. Few may want to believe this, but the alternate explanation—that the mainstream media somehow subconsciously hoodwinked voters—doesn’t seem correct. According to polling, Trump supporters are disproportionately likely to support banning Muslims (and gays and lesbians) from entering the country, call for immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants, and even wish that the South had won the Civil War. They didn’t learn these things from the Washington Post.
For those who insist on a narrative, here’s one: Trump’s rise is the natural extension of years of dog-whistle politics embraced by Republican elites during the Obama years. Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and Mitt Romney were all happy to flirt with the racists and nativists, the xeno- and Islamophobes for years. But only Donald had the gumption to finally ask them to prom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little house, painted yellow, with a small front stoop and an attic overlooking the road stood across from what was then the Holyoke Center, now the Smith Campus Center. It was this little yellow house where Harvard's Institute of Politics was born.
The house went unnoticed on the IOP’s opening night, October 17, 1966. The attention of the press, the students, and the secret service was directed across the street, where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Robert F. Kennedy ’48, Edward M. Kennedy ’54, Institute President Richard E. Neustadt, Washington Post President Katharine Graham, and a number of others—including cabinet members, an ambassador, and Harvard President Nathan M. Pusey ’28—gathered for the opening reception in the Holyoke Center penthouse.
The Crimson reported at the time that about “200 students and Harvard Square workers” gathered outside the Holyoke Center, where the FBI mandated that the guards ask for identification from anybody entering the building. The Kennedy brothers were rushed to the Center after a political rally, stopping briefly to shake hands on their way inside, where a dinner of “oysters Rockefeller, endive ala Franchaise, and roast tenderloin of beef Bordelaise” awaited them.
The black-tie party in the Holyoke Center, said President Pusey, was not only “a birthday party for the Kennedy Institute,” but also a “wedding feast” between government and academia: “a commemorative dinner” for President Kennedy and the new Institute of Politics.
The pageantry and fanfare of the dinner stands in contrast to “the little yellow house,” as it was then known, which is flanked—overshadowed—on one side by the Spee, and on the other side by the Signet. The house at 78 Mount Auburn St. is where Harvard’s “living memorial” to President John F. Kennedy ’40 began, and it still stands today, although the Institute moved to its present location on JFK Street in 1978.
The fellows and students would meet in “a small room,” according to Mark D. Gearan ’78, a former Crimson editor and member of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee, the undergraduate body partially responsible for the composition and direction of the Institute. “Literally, it was the living room,” he said.
The small stature of the building did not reflect the power nor the importance of the guests that came and continue to come to the Institute to engage with Harvard undergraduates. For the next 50 years, the Institute has brought in speakers from all areas of public service.
The Institute also has seen countless study groups and fellows, and the creation of the Director’s Internships, the Policy Program, and the Harvard Political Review.
All of this was done to fulfill the Institute’s mission of engaging Harvard undergraduates with leaders in public service and encouraging these students to go into public service themselves, however the students may define it. On April 1 and 2, the Institute will celebrate its 50th anniversary of fulfilling this mission.
FORUM FOR POLITICAL LEADERS
One of the defining characteristics of the IOP is its ability to bring in prominent political figures. Congresswoman Elise M. Stefanik ’06, who served as vice president of the Student Advisory Committee as an undergraduate, remembers the speakers as being a particularly noteworthy part of her Harvard experience.
“The opportunities that the IOP provides are world class, and unlike any other institution in the world, really.” Stefanik said. “The fact that they host speakers in the forum multiple times a week…[is] unlike anywhere else, and it prepares you to have a seat at the table.”
From its very first days, the Institute has brought in high-profile and often controversial speakers. Robert S. McNamara, who served as the United States Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968 and was influential in defining America’s role in Vietnam, was one of the first speakers at the IOP.
McNamara’s visit to campus didn’t sit well with a large segment of the student body. A petition circulated requesting that McNamara debate with an anti-war representative and garnered more than 1,600 signatures, of which approximately 50 were from faculty members. According to The Crimson, two students even planned to dump bloody bones at the feet of the Secretary as an act of protest.
A crowd of 700 students turned out to protest McNamara’s visit, and blocked the Secretary’s exit. Former Dean of the Kennedy School Graham T. Allison ’62 had to act as a decoy, making his way through the students in a car, so that McNamara could be taken to Leverett House on foot, and then smuggled in the underground tunnels to Kirkland before he could make his escape.
While this instance may stand out in terms of the opposition’s ferocity toward the speaker, the IOP continued to bring in important and controversial speakers to engage with students.
Anurima Bhargava ’96, a former IOP member and current fellow, remembers being awed by the speakers that came to the forum. She recalls one instance where, within a span of a few weeks Israeli and Palestinian leaders were to come express their points of view at the Forum.
“For me to be able to see Yasser Arafat,” she said, “and then two weeks later [Yitzhak] Rabin was supposed to speak, but he was assassinated in the interim.”
Since its founding, the IOP has hosted international leaders, from George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton to Mikhail Gorbachev, and Aung San Suu Kyi. The Institute has also hosted individuals from the arts, including Barbra Streisand and Peter Yarrow, part of the group Peter, Paul, and Mary.
PUBLIC SERVICE, BROADLY DEFINED
Part of the Institute's mission includes a broader definition of public service than simply becoming a politician or lawmaker. According to alumni, this has had a large effect on students who have gone through the IOP, and, in particular, those who are less politically-inclined.
Henry W. McGee III ’74, a former Crimson editor, a member of the SAC, and longtime president of HBO’s home entertainment division, was involved with the IOP, even though he knew he “was interested in public service, but not necessarily elected office.”
“I joined the student advisory committee not because of an interest in politics, but because of an interest in public service,” he said. “I turned my attention to public service in the arts, which overlapped quite strongly with President Kennedy’s interest in the arts.”
For Bhargava, her time at the IOP and on the SAC also encouraged her to go into public service, although not on the politician track.
“It encouraged me to pursue a career in civil rights,” she said. “I didn’t think of myself as a political person....[but] I did know I wanted to fix some of the problems in my community.”
This year there is an extra focus on the relationship between public service and the arts, as Anne  Hawley, former director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, is directing her own study group with a focus on how art can be used for both political and cultural purposes.
A TRAINING GROUND FOR POLITICIANS
That isn’t to say, however, that the IOP hasn’t seen its share of political enthusiasts. Former members of the IOP have emphasized how their time at the Institute gave them the tools and confidence they needed to pursue a career in politics and public office.
Stefanik is a current member of Congress from upstate New York and the youngest congresswoman ever elected. She said she “was interested in public policy and engagement” before she got to Harvard, but credited “the skillset that the IOP afforded” her and everyone else in the program for giving her “the confidence to run for office.”
“It helped prepare me for the very partisan political world right now. I am very respectful of people who disagree with me, and I have a record of working across the aisle,” she said. “And that has served me well in Congress.”
Eric P. Lesser ’07 was also a member of the SAC before going on to a career in politics: first working for the Obama campaign, then in the White House, and now as a Massachusetts state senator. Lesser credits the IOP for augmenting his interest in politics.
“I was a Director’s Intern for a summer and I taught a citizenship class in the local public schools,” Lesser said. “It really opened my eyes to a group of young people who shared my belief in that the political process can be a force for good.”
Gearan also went on to a long career in politics. He worked on both the Dukakis and Clinton campaigns, then served as Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, head of the Peace Corps, and finally took his current position as President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1999. He also emphasized the unique perspective on politics that students gain at the IOP.
“I think I had a window into the world of politics and public service that I don’t think I would've had as just a Government major,” he said. “It exposed me to debates, conversations, and individuals, and to really contemplate public service as a career.”
While the IOP has produced scores of public servants, the current race for the 8th Congressional District in Maryland stands out. Kathleen A. Matthews, an IOP fellow from 2004, and Jamie Raskin ’83, a former IOP member, are competing for the soon-to-be-vacated seat of Congressman Chris Van Hollen, himself a Kennedy School alum.

Over the past three decades, the field of medicine has seen dramatic advancements. However, for the 233 year-old Harvard Medical School, its basic curriculum remained relatively unchanged from the 1980s. Medical students spent their first two years primarily in lectures and late-night cram sessions for exams.
“In the good old days, we required a med student to essentially do two more years of pre-med,” Nancy E. Oriol, Dean of Students at the Medical School, said.
Last year, however, the Medical School uprooted its old curriculum, debuting the new “Pathways” programs after three years of planning.
The new curriculum streamlines clinical experiences for students, while placing the impetus on them to do a large part of their learning before entering the classroom.
Now six months into the new curriculum, students and professors alike said that although the demands outside the classroom have increased, the education at the Medical School better prepares students for future medical careers.
“The fact that we get clinical exposure, learning how to interview patients, do physical exams, and learning other clinical skills from essentially day one of Medical School first year, is already positioning us well to become more thoughtful capable physicians down the road,” Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14, a first year medical student at HMS, said.
“It really has been incredibly well received by the students,” Medical School professor Richard M. Schwartzstein, who led the committee that changed the curriculum, said. “As best I can tell, we’re actually achieving a lot of the goals we set out to.”
In addition to the curriculum change, an increase in student feedback has led to greater awareness for the mental health and wellness of medical students, whose daily lives are notoriously stressful and rigorous. Administrators are also working to adapt mentorship programming to aid new students seeking inter-year relationships despite different curricular experiences.
“The Curriculum of the Future”
The driving force behind the curriculum change was placing a larger emphasis on active learning and hands-on involvement, according to Schwartzstein.
“It was several years of work on the part of the faculty trying to improve the level of engagement of the students with the curriculum, the level of preparation, the sense that we wanted people to spend more time problem solving and application of the material they were learning rather than transfer of content,” he said.
Classes are now more focused on learning through a case-based collaborative environment. Professors expect students to prepare by spending time outside of the classroom learning the concepts. There’s an “expectation that you come to the sessions prepared to work,” Dayton McMillan, a first year student at HMS, said. Upon entering the classroom, students study and apply those concepts to real cases.
“Overall, it’s been amazing. It’s really maximized the amount of learning and I think it’s done it in a very efficient way so there’s a lot of retention,” Perry S. Choi ’15, another HMS first year student, said. He added that he was surprised by how much the new method taught him about the importance of collaboration.
Because the conventional "learning" time has been pushed outside the classroom in the flipped classroom manner, students report there is more work outside of class than in previous years.
“[Upperclass students] see our curriculum and think, ‘Wow this is so much more intense,’ and for us, we don’t really have that frame of reference,” Choi said.
Regardless of the increased work outside the classroom, both Choi and Aung said they have heard few complaints from their peers.
“We were convinced of the efficacy of that increased intensity: more efficient learning and better retention, and also more fun learning where you're not just sitting around listening to people,” Choi said.
Schwartzstein said he hopes the new program utilizes the school’s resources efficiently.
“The most valuable resource a university has are the faculty, and faculty time and faculty time interacting with students,” Schwartzstein said. “So if you have a person standing in front of a large class of students —160 in the case of the Med School or so—talking at them, that’s actually not a great use of time.”
According to Dean of Medical Education Edward Hundert, the new method has been effective in encouraging collaboration between students and professors.
“The students are more engaged than ever, an outcome we attribute to the creation of a culture where the students and faculty are truly partners in the ongoing development and continuous improvement of the curriculum,” Hundert wrote in an email.
The feedback from the new curriculum, gauged in a survey last semester,  has thus far been positive, professor Randall W. King said.
Professors too, have noticed a change in their students. Schwartzstein said in his own class he has seen that students are more motivated because they are able to see how their education directly applies to patients, and their ability to engage in problem solving is “vastly different” and “much better than it was in the old curriculum.”
Student Wellness
Though the new curriculum comes with drastic changes, the transition to medical school remains difficult.
“The first year of medical school is always a challenge,” Oriol said. “You’re in a new world, the expectations are so totally different…  All of a sudden for the first time in your life, you can’t work hard enough to know everything.”
Choi said student wellness was not discussed as often as he would have liked earlier in the year. However, he said he feels the discussion has increased, in part because HMS Student Council President Jessica Stuart focused her platform on the issue. He also said the faculty wants to know how the students are doing and how they balance their lives.
A program called Ed Reps was created to solicit feedback from students regarding the new curriculum. The Ed Reps are first year students who regularly meet with faculty to update them on students’ comments, according to first year HMS student Anna Morenz.
Morenz, who is a member of the Ed Reps, said students have driven discussions about mental health.
She also said the group worked with faculty to design a survey students took at the end of “Foundations of Medicine,” one of the first basic science courses students take at the Medical School..
King, who teaches the Foundations course, said it is difficult to gauge how students are able to manage the workload of classes.
“This year’s class can help us think about strategies we can help develop to next year’s class,” he said.
Despite the potential difficulties in achieving a work-life balance, many students seem to be satisfied with the new curriculum.
“If you look at the statistics, I guess on average people are somewhat stressed. I might be an outlier that I'm not really stressed, but I also think that people are happy with the curriculum in general. It's a good move forward,” Choi said.
Some changes have already been made to the new curriculum based on student feedback. For instance, early on students felt the lab manuals were very long, and there was not enough time to read them, according to Aung. After learning this, the course directors quickly shortened the manuals.
Oriol recounted how early in the year, quizzes were scheduled for Thursdays, but it turned out that it was “disruptive” to students, and so they were moved to Fridays.
“They’ve been particularly open to feedback. We have this amazing opportunity where we sort of have the ear of the faculty and so a lot of my class has been excited to go to them and give them feedback and help them find ways to improve,” Morenz said.
Morenz said the advising system at HMS helps students provide even further feedback. Each student has specific advisers to meet with once every two months, according to McMillan. Additionally, students are able to reach out to the dean of students, the dean of multicultural affairs, and professors for advice.
McMillan agreed there was very fast turn around for feedback.
“They’ve been very responsive,” he said. However, he added that he thinks the administration has almost asked for too much feedback.
Inter-Year Student Relationships
With the new curriculum comes not only academic change, but also changes in the student life and relationships between the first year medical students and older students at HMS. King said it is harder for second year students to give advice to the first years because of their different experiences under the new program.
Some second year students, who are not subject to the new curriculum,  even look to it with envy.
Second year student Faith C. Robertson said some of her peers view themselves in much the same light as “neglected older sibling[s].”
“There’s been a lot of fluctuating animosity in my class towards the first years. Not at them, but the system. People were so frustrated. It created a divide,” Robertson said.
Despite this, Oriol said there is a potential new program in place to ensure students can still get to know their peers in other years.
Because of the new curriculum, third and fourth year students will be able to spend time on campus now. Previously, after the first two years, students would continuously spend their time at hospitals, hindering opportunities for relationships between younger and older students, Oriol said.
Now, after their core clerkship in hospitals, students have a year and a half when they finish basic science courses, apply to residency positions, and pursue individual projects, according to Schwartzstein.
The new curriculum, though, does have some tradeoffs when it comes to mentoring relationships between students of different years. In the past, there was a big sibling, little sibling program in place between first and second year students so that first year students would have a peer to turn to for advice, according to Oriol. However, with the new curriculum in place, this will not be possible because second year students will be involved in hospital work.
Since third and fourth year students under the new curriculum may have more time, Oriol said she expects a family program to replace the big sibling, little sibling program.
Another consequence of the new curriculum is the cancellation of the Second Year Show, which has always been a popular communal event for second year students. The show had to be curtailed because there is simply no time for second year students to accommodate it with the new curriculum, Oriol said.
In light of this change, the show will now be in the fourth year, according to Oriol. Aung said that although she was disappointed by the cancellation, she was willing to make certain trade-offs for the preparation the new curriculum offers.
“I think in the long term, the new curriculum will make us—I’m hoping—into better physicians,”  Aung said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy night for the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee.
During their weekly meeting Wednesday, the committee issued grants pack cuts for the second consecutive week, created new incentives for student organizations that collaborate with each other, and handled the first appeal of a grants allocation in about a decade.
Every week, the Finance Committee sets a target budget for student organizations that is typically over $10,000. When projected grant allocations totaled $11,547, greater than the committee’s weekly target of $10,800, the committee issued a 6.6 percent funding cut to all grant-receiving organizations this week. Last week, the committee issued a 15 percent cut to its weekly grant pack. 
Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 attributed the large increase in funding requests to a communications reform legislation that the committee passed earlier this month in response to a controversial theater funding policy. Many students criticized the policy and said it was indicative of a lack of communication between the UC and the student body.
As part of the reform, Greenlaw added 232 club treasurers and more than 500 presidents to a centralized email list to inform them of the UC’s funding policies. The Finance Committee has seen a sharp uptick in funding requests—the body received 65 requests this week, compared to an average of 38 per week before the policy was passed—according to Greenlaw.
“We do have to make cuts on the regular now,” Greenlaw said.
In addition to voting to increase transportation funding at the meeting, the committee also passed a “Club Collaboration Bonus” legislation to encourage student organizations to host events together.
“Campus is over-programmed,” Greenlaw said. “The number of people that people expect to come to events cannot possibly actually be true. And we are consequently spending a significant amount of money on events that are sparsely attended.”
Under the legislation, student organizations that collaborate on an event will be immune from any cuts that the committee is forced to make. Greenlaw said he hopes to eventually introduce an additional bonus on top of existing funding that collaborating organizations may receive.
While the legislation passed unanimously, some committee members raised concerns about the enforcement of the new program.
“The only thing I’m concerned about is that it’s so hard for us to screen,” Finance Committee Secretary  Taylor P. Li ’18 said.
This is not the first time the Finance Committee has adopted legislation to attempt to encourage student organizations to jointly host events. Former Finance Committee Chair Leah C. Singer ’16 introduced a “Community Building Grant” in 2013 designed to reward student organizations for collaborating.
After five consecutive semesters, “not a single organization has invoked the Community Building Grant,” Greenlaw said.
Greenlaw says that his collaboration grant legislation is a “reinvented” form of Singer’s grant.
The original “Bridging and Belonging Grant,” established in 2014 but later rebranded as the “Grant for an Open Harvard College” under current UC President Shaiba Rather ’17, also encouraged student groups to host events together. The original grant was “woefully underutilized in five consecutive semesters,” according to legislation the UC passed this semester.
The Finance Committee also had to dust off its appeals process after a organization formally contested a previous grant allocation, the first time this type of allocation has been appealed in about a decade.
Over the past two weeks, the Harvard College Soulfood Christian Fellowship requested a $1,183 large venue grant and a $833 standard grant for their “More than Music Concert.” The committee awarded the group a total of $850.
Edem M. Fagbolagun ’17, the group’s Finance Chair, appealed the decision Wednesday and asked the UC  to reconsider. After deliberation, the UC’s Finance Committee determined that the group’s request for funding a headliner for their concert did not warrant additional funding, and ultimately voted against considering the appeal.
Fagbolagun did not respond to request for comment. Greenlaw recused himself from the deliberations due to a conflict of interest.
The entire UC must vote on all Finance Committee funding allocations every week, meaning the Council is permitted to, by a majority vote, overrule or modify the funding allotment for the Soulfood Christian Fellowship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi called for greater investments in culture and education, in addition to national security, to stabilize current political and economic unrest in Europe at the Harvard Art Museums on Thursday.
According to Renzi, this is the first time an incumbent prime minister of Italy has visited Harvard. His address, sponsored by the Center for European Studies and the Italian Consulate General in Boston, is part of a four-day tour in the U.S.
Renzi began his address emphasizing the role universities play as leaders of change. He said students, researchers, and professors are central to creating new strategies for solving society’s most pressing problems.
“We need a different idea of the world—we need a different approach by students, by researchers, by professors,” he said. “Universities around the world are the keys to the future.”
Given the recent terrorist attacks that took place in Brussels, Renzi stressed the importance of new initiatives to stem acts of violence around globe.
“The attack of Brussels is an incredible attack to the ideals of Europe and the unity of Europe,” he said.
Renzi said these incidents not only reflect the threats posed by actors outside of Europe, but, more importantly, reveal issues within Europe that contribute to the radicalization of European citizens. Renzi called for stronger political action to combat terrorism in Europe.
“The enemy is not only abroad,” he said. “The enemy is inside our cities, inside our borders.”
Renzi suggested the solution to this problem is to “invest in both directions.” He said an investment in culture and education is equally as important as investments in security and technology “because it is exactly our culture that is the target of terrorists.”
Renzi urged a governmental response to the issues affecting Europe. Arguing that problems in Europe partly derive from legislative deadlock, he called for less focus on economic austerity and an increase in the power of government leaders to implement reforms.
The Prime Minister argued that recent economic and political reforms in Italy have benefited the country. Renzi said the reduction of taxes, exposure to new markets, and implementation of structural reforms in Italian politics have contributed to the country’s recent financial recovery.
“We must finally open the minds, open the doors, and invest in a different future,” he said. “It is a priority for me and my team… to create the possibility and the opportunity for the new generation to live the dream and not the nightmare.”
Pietro Galeone ’17 said he appreciated the prime minister’s hopeful message for the future and his support for political and economic reform.
“The focus on the investment in culture and an institution of higher education was something that I think was very powerful,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 1, 2016, at 2:25 p.m.
A Harvard team dedicated to studying football players' health recently launched an iPhone app to facilitate the collection of data from former players.
In order to improve treatment strategies for common conditions among football players, the research group—called the Football Players Health Study—launched the TeamStudy app in order to allow surveying larger numbers of participants. The researchers will be able to compare data from former professional players against a control group consisting of members of the general public.
By prompting users to answer basic questions about their health and perform simple tasks, the app captures important details about players’ day-to-day experiences that a questionnaire might overlook, according to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, principal investigator of the study and a Harvard Medical School professor.
“By the nature of a questionnaire, you end up collecting information based on what they share, what they are telling us. We want to go beyond that,” Pascual-Leone said. “The TeamStudy app will capture aspects of day-to-day life, how people are actually performing, how quickly they are walking, what their heart rates are.”
The researchers hope that TeamStudy, available for free download in the App Store, will generate greater insight into areas like cognition, cardiac health, balance, and mobility. The app was designed with input from former football players who communicated their health concerns to the researchers.
“We want to make sure that the things we focus on are really key things for the players,” said Pascual-Leone. “So from the very beginning, we set up a group of former players who are involved in guiding all aspects of the whole initiative.”
The Football Players Health Study, which consists of researchers from multiple Harvard schools, is the largest study of former professional football players to date. Since its launch in 2014, the study has surveyed more than 2,800 participants.
With the launch of TeamStudy, the researchers hope they will be able to reach much larger numbers of players in order to generate more significant data.
“If you think about the number of people that have been hired by professional football teams in the NFL from 1960 to today, there should be around 14,000 former players,” Pascual-Leone said. “We’re hoping to engage as many of them as possible. The larger the number, the more important and relevant the results will be.”
The potential health risks associated with playing professional football have become an increasingly important area of study for the medical community in general, according to Frank Wang, head team physician for Harvard Athletics.
“There are a number of health concerns that can be associated with professional football players, including more neurologic issues such as depression, cognitive decline, and questions of chronic traumatic encephalopathy,” Wang said. “As more information becomes available, sports medicine professionals have become more cognizant of concussion and head trauma.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weeks after Ivy League football coaches unanimously voted to prohibit regular-season full tackle practices, the National Football League for the first time acknowledged the link between playing football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease caused by continued trauma to the brain.
In light of the NFL's recent admission, experts praised the proposal by Ivy League coaches to limit tackling in practices.
Christopher J. Nowinski ’00, a former Harvard football player and WWE wrestler, and the current executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, praised the Ivy League’s potential rule change, saying the move sets a good example for the rest of college sports.
“I think it absolutely sends a strong message now that we understand the risks of competitive brain trauma,” Nowinski said. “For [Harvard football coach Tim Murphy] to help lead that discussion is a real testament to his desire to make the game as safe as possible."
Nowinski more generally said Harvard has always taken the issue of concussions in football seriously, and praised the University for its commitment to player safety.
The NFL's acknowledgement at a congressional hearing, made by the league's senior vice president, Jeffrey B. Miller, was a significant step in the right direction toward awareness of the risks of playing football according to Ann McKee, an investigator at the CTE Center at Boston University.
“We’re hoping that there is large scale recognition that CTE is a risk when playing football,” McKee said.
McKee added that evidence shows cutting down on tackling would have positive effects for athletes’ health.
“All our evidence is pointing to the fact that subconcussive hits, these repetitive hits that occur routinely on every play of the game, and the cumulative exposure to those subconcussive hits, is what really triggers CTE and some of the other long-term consequences,” McKee said. “By eliminating any of the exposure, reducing hits in practice, reducing the number of games played, the time in games, all of those things will help reduce the long term consequences.”
McKee said it was especially important to be mindful of the risks of football for amateur athletes in additional to NFL players.
“Certainly, our work has identified CTE in many professional football players, but we’re also seeing it in a very high percentage of college players,” McKee said. “We’ve looked at the brains of 55 college players now, and 45 of them have had CTE.”
For younger players, McKee said the risk of head injuries was even more substantial than for players in the NFL.
“Surprisingly, the earlier you play, playing football is associated with more severe cognitive decline and changes in [brain scans],” McKee said. “It suggests that the younger brain is actually more susceptible to injury.”
She attributed this distinction to various physical differences between professionals and lower level players.
“Amateur athletes usually do not have the physical musculature that advanced athletes have, they don’t have the coordination, or the skill set, so they’re going to be more susceptible to these injuries,” McKee said.

As a professor and chaplain on Harvard’s campus for more than three decades, Reverend Peter J. Gomes was hard to miss. Gomes, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at the Harvard Divinity School and the Pusey Minister at Memorial Chapel, was beloved at the University as a thunderous Baptist preacher and staunch advocate for gay rights.
Now, his likeness will live on at the University he called home for so many years. On Thursday, University President Drew G. Faust unveiled a portrait of Gomes—who died in 2011—that will hang on the seafoam green walls of the Faculty Room in University Hall. The first portrait of a person of color to hang in the storied chamber, Gomes' likeness joins a host of paintings of hallowed Harvard faculty and leaders.
Former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and Wendel W. “Tad” Meyer, a former acting Pusey Minister, joined Faust in introducing the portrait and the man it represents. They each spoke warmly of a passionate, dedicated member of the Harvard faculty who was not afraid to speak his mind at the monthly FAS faculty meetings.
Smith commenced the ceremony and reception in the ornate room, packed with a who’s-who of Harvard faculty, staff, and alumni. Faust and Smith both pointed out that the Gomes portrait will perch near where the man himself used to sit during faculty meetings—in a back corner, near the door.
“I’m afraid that after we dedicate this portrait it will begin to speak,” said Faust, who recalled when Gomes came to her office after she was elected president and pledged his “fealty” to her. “I’ll look up and I’ll find him declaiming against some measure that he sees as an unwarranted and dangerous intrusion of the present upon the past.”
History professor Joyce E. Chaplin, and Robin Kelsey and Thomas B.F. Cummins, both History of Art and Architecture professors, made up the selection committee that chose Gomes to have a portrait in the Faculty Room. Yuqi Wang painted the portrait of Gomes in regal religious robes.
“I take great delight in the fact that this portrait will hang here in this impressive setting, establishing a new and long overdue precedent so that all who gather here from every race, creed, sexual orientation, or political inclination may be inspired to engage the mystery of this remarkable human being,” Meyer said during his remarks.
Patrick, a student and friend of Gomes, recalled the reverend’s advice to look at things he did not understand—such as a Joyce passage or his roommate’s political views—from a different angle.
“I’m hoping, for those of us who from time to time have an opportunity to sit beneath this portrait and his others, that we will see looking down from the loving, witty, whimsical, wise expression a constant reminder to try that new perspective,” Patrick said.
While few have their portraits hung in the Faculty Room, the honor, many said, would have suited Gomes.
“The Peter Gomes that I knew and loved would never think that there can be too many attempts to portray the depths of his mystery in all of its penetrating perplexity,” Meyer said.

Former Secretary of State Madeleine J.K. Albright will be the speaker at the Kennedy School of Government's graduation this year, Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced Thursday.
Albright was the first woman to serve as the United States’ Secretary of State when she was appointed in 1997. After four years as ambassador to the United Nations, President Bill Clinton tapped Albright as the country’s top diplomat, where she served until the beginning of 2001.
Now a professor of international relations at Georgetown University, Albright pursued an interventionist style of foreign policy during her tenure as Secretary of State, once famously asking General Colin Powell, who succeed her, "What's the point of you saving this superb military for, Colin, if we can't use it?"
In a press release, Elmendorf described the former Secretary as “a remarkable public servant whose decades of work on behalf of world peace, security and justice should serve as an inspiration to us all.”
“We are elated that she will deliver the Graduation Address for the HKS Class of 2016,” he said.
Kennedy School students largely seemed excited to have as their graduation speaker such a prominent figure in the field of politics and public service.
“She is of a stature that is exciting,” Loren D. Newman, a student at the Kennedy School, said. “Speakers in the past have been policymakers who aren’t necessarily in the public eye.”
In particular, Newman was happy that Albright is someone his family, who will be attending his graduation, can recognize.
“[My mom] knows who she is, and my grandmother knows who she is, and that’s really exciting,” Newman said.
Tommy A. Flint, a Kennedy School student, said he was “pleasantly surprised” and excited that they got “a big name” to speak at graduation.
“She can offer commentary of value about public service,” he said. “I’m glad that we have someone very closely related to our study.”
Eddie D. Grom ’12, currently enrolled in the Kennedy School, also was “excited” that HKS was able to get Albright to agree to speak.
“One of things that is amazing about the Kennedy School is the high profile people that speak here,” he said. “People who make a change in the world. She really fits that bill.”
This year, the Kennedy School’s commencement will takes place from May 23 to May 27, with Albright slated to speak on May 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s loosely defined “Enterprise Research Campus,” a planned 36-acre center for entrepreneurship in Allston, now has a leader to guide its construction.
Harvard announced on Thursday the hiring of real estate agent Steven D. Fessler for the newly created position, “head of enterprise real estate.” Fessler will take office on April 18.
The idea for the enterprise research campus first emerged in 2011, when the Harvard Allston Work Team, a 14-member group of faculty and alumni commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust to guide Harvard’s Allston planning, recommended the campus’ construction.
When completed, the research campus will lie across from the Business School and adjacent to the proposed science and engineering complex, where roughly two-thirds of the SEAS faculty are slated to move in the fall of 2020. Harvard has yet to release details concerning the buildings meant to fill the enterprise research campus.
Broadly, Fessler’s responsibilities consist of overseeing the enterprise research campus’s development, University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp wrote in an email, adding that he will work closely with “folks across the University” in addition to real estate developers and other agencies hoping to relocate to Allston and will report directly to her.
John A. Bruno, an Allston resident and chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said Fessler’s hiring represents a step in the right direction.
“Harvard University seldom seems to have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to real estate innovation and development,” he said. “This gentleman [Fessler] may be able to think more about the whole of the community… This may just help us see what Harvard would like to do and what the community would like to do.”
Lapp wrote that Harvard’s rationale for creating the new position included the unique opportunities for its Allston landholdings, which are “unlike any [opportunities] facing a university of our size.” The University intends to “move forward” strategically and thoughtfully, she added, and Fessler’s appointment is the first step.
Harvard has already begun attempts to convert Allston into an entrepreneurial center. In 2011, Harvard completed construction of the Harvard Innovation Lab, a co-working space designed to provide resources for student start-ups, and in 2014, the University finished building the Launch Lab, a similar facility for alumni. A third building geared specifically toward student and alumni biotechnology ventures will open this fall.
“Harvard’s enterprise research campus presents an unparalleled opportunity to enhance the power of collaboration among the area’s academic institutions, hospitals, and research-based industries,” Faust said in a press release.
A Stanford graduate, Fessler until recently led SDF Properties LLC, a New England-based real estate investment and advisory firm he founded. Prior to working at SDF, Fessler held senior leadership positions at various Boston real estate agencies.
Harvard conducted a “very thorough,” months-long search process via a third-party search firm before finally settling on Fessler, according to Lapp. Now, she said, Fessler is “eager” to get started.
“I’m thrilled to be joining the team at Harvard, ” Fessler said in a press release. “The progress now unfolding in Allston is truly exciting... [and] the transformative potential of this new center of innovation is absolutely tremendous."

A Harvard degree, despite the stereotypes that sometimes come with it, is a valuable asset for working in the public sector, according to two alumni and leaders in Boston city government.
Although the Harvard name is sometimes accompanied by negative stereotypes off campus, Michelle Wu ’07, President of Boston’s City Council, said these potential stereotypes have not negatively affected her time in office.
The effect of the “H-Bomb” was something that Wu said she was “primed for.”
“People talk a lot about Harvard in politics,” she said. “Harvard came up in the Romney campaign, it came up in Obama’s campaign. People have different reactions.”
In her own experience, she said, she found her Harvard degree to only be an asset.
“People very much respect the work that goes into a Harvard degree,” she added.
Daniel A. Koh ’07, Chief of Staff in the Boston Mayor’s Office, said Harvard students must be aware of these stereotypes and try to counter them with open-mindedness in the workplace.
Koh said his Harvard degree does not make him feel superior to his colleagues, many of whom have years of experience in certain fields.
“There are many people in a room who know more about a topic than I do,” said Koh.
Wu added that students can disprove these stereotypes through their actions.
“You control the narrative in how you communicate and connect with other people,” she said.
Both Wu and Koh said their liberal arts education prepared them to face a wide range of challenges while working in city government .
“I think what is great about Harvard College is that it really encourages the study of a diversity of different fields. In a job like Chief of Staff in a city like Boston, there is a diversity of issues,” said Koh.
Such an education, he said, equipped him with the right mentality to address different issues.
Koh, who is also a graduate of the Harvard Business School, said he initially planned to choose working in the private sector instead of the public sector. But an opportunity he found during his time in business school—the HBS Leadership Fellows Program—changed the direction of his career path.
The program provided an opportunity to work in the Mayor’s Office, which was an environment that appealed to him with its efficiency and impact.
Aside from holding top positions within Boston city government, both Wu and Koh graduated in the same class and had mutual friends while at the college.
“I just love seeing his leadership in City Hall and having that common connection,” said Wu.

UPDATED: April 1, 2016, at 5:03 a.m.
Michael J. Won scheduled his hour-and-a-half cello rehearsal to start at 4 p.m. He gave his cell phone to his piano accompanist, who turned it off and promised not to give it to him until 5:30.
“I didn’t want to count down the seconds until 5 p.m. and check immediately,” said Won, who wanted to postpone the moment of finding out whether he would become a member of Harvard’s Class of 2020.
When he read “Congratulations,” in big bold letters, he started shouting. When he told his mother, she started to cry.
Won, a student at the Dalton School in New York City, is one of the 1,119 students who were admitted to Harvard’s Class of 2020 via regular decision.
He described his college application process to be “long” and “emotional.” He had wanted to attend Harvard ever since he first visited, he said, when he studied in Widener Library with his cousin and walked around Harvard Square.
Won is not the only admitted student who procrastinated checking the long-anticipated admission decision.
Despite seeing a notification at 4:59 p.m. that her portal had a status update, Ellen Y. Li waited until her best friend received a decision—an acceptance. It was only then that Li ventured to view her results.
“I started screaming and we called each other and we screamed for five minutes straight,” said Li, a student at Buchholz High School in Gainesville, Fla. “I just didn’t want to know until she knew.”
Li reported that despite the thrill of the acceptance, she continued to follow through her extracurricular commitments on Thursday.
“I had to tutor a girl from 5:30 to 6:30, so I was super excited and energetic while tutoring,” she said. “I still have to process what happened.”
Cherri L. Wang, a student at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, Calif., who had just been rejected from Princeton and Yale, was “huddled up in the covers,” and preparing herself for rejection when she checked her Harvard admissions portal.
“I screamed and ran all over the house,” she said.
To distract herself in the hours leading up to 5:00, Beverly Ge, also a student at Buchholz High School, cleaned her room and talked to a friend and her mom, glancing at the clock often. She said that before she checked her admissions result, she reminded herself to “expect the worst.”
The worst never happened.
“I asked my friend ‘does this say that I got it? Did I actually get in?’” Ge said. “It didn’t feel real. I just can’t believe that I was admitted.”
She said her friend is going to bake her a cake in celebration. “Maybe red velvet, because it’s Crimson.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 1
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of students who were accepted for Harvard's Class of 2020 via regular decision.

Harvard’s attempt to trademark the name of CS50, the College’s introductory computer science course, hit a snag in early March when the United States Patent and Trademark Office refused portions of the University’s applications, saying the terms “CS50” and “CS50x” were too similar to existing trademarks.
The USPTO’s “office actions”—documents that inform applicants of changes necessary to proceed in registering a trademark—listed multiple problems and necessary edits to Harvard’s applications for the two trademarks. While office actions are relatively common, this particular document, issued March 3, refused large parts of Harvard’s “description of services” on the grounds that the trademark could be confused with “CSO40” and “CSO50,” registered trademarks owned by the Massachusetts-based International Data Group Inc. 
With multiple corporate sponsors, a robust online following, and a recently-piloted program to teach AP Computer Science, CS50’s influence reaches far beyond Harvard’s campus. Perhaps most notably, the course spread to New Haven last fall, becoming Yale’s introductory computer science course. Early this month, University President Drew G. Faust simultaneously praised the course and poked fun at Yale during an alumni fundraising event. In December 2015, Harvard filed to trademark “CS50” and “CS50x.”
The University is not the only party, however, that has tried to trademark CS50. Between 2011 and 2013, the course’s instructor, David J. Malan ’99, attempted to trademark the course himself, ultimately withdrawing his applications in 2013 after Harvard moved toward blocking Malan’s applications. In February, Harvard declined to comment on the string of applications and Malan did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In the time between Malan’s 2013 withdrawal and Harvard’s applications in December 2015, though, CSO40 and CSO50 became registered trademarks of the International Data Group.
“The University hasn't yet replied to the USPTO’s comments but will do so within the allotted time frame,” Harvard Spokesperson David J. Cameron wrote in an email.  Cameron did not clarify whether this meant Harvard would continue to pursue trademark or abandon its applications. According to Georgetown Law Professor and Trademark Expert Rebecca L. Tushnet '95, Harvard has a few options as it considers how to proceed.
“They could drop the application for the… particular services that the trademark office found a conflict with. They could try again with, say, ‘Harvard CS50,’ or something like that. That would certainly distinguish it,” said Tushnet.
Tushnet said Harvard could also attempt to secure a trademark “coexistence agreement” with IDG Inc.  Cameron declined to comment on whether Harvard would seek such an agreement with the company. IDG Spokesperson Lynn Holmlund wrote in an email that she was “unable to comment” because she was unaware of any potential coexistence agreement between IDG and Harvard.
Despite the setback from the USPTO, Tushnet said the University has “a decent chance of ending up with something, although the breadth and effectiveness of it remains in doubt.”
Harvard has six months from the date of the office action to reply to the USPTO’s comments. CS50 is the only class on Harvard’s non-exhaustive list of registered or pending trademarks.

United States Congressman Joaquín Castro discussed immigration, the current presidential election, and the status of Latinos in the U.S. at a talk moderated by CNN Political Analyst and Kennedy School professor David Gergen at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday.
Castro is a member of the Democratic Party who represents the 20th congressional district of Texas, which largely encompasses the San Antonio area. His twin brother, Julián Castro, currently serves as President Barack H. Obama’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and has been rumored to be a contender for the Democrats' 2016 Vice Presidential nomination. Both brothers are active supporters of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
Joaquín Castro, advocating Democratic policy, emphasized the need for immigration reform, and criticized the Republican presidential candidates for their handling of the issue throughout the current campaign cycle.
“Donald Trump and the Republicans have turned the conversation about immigration into a nasty one, and one that makes it hard for the country to come together,” he said in an interview before his talk.
“I feel like [Trump] kicked off his campaign with slander. He slandered a whole population of people. He slandered immigrants, he slandered Latinos, but not just Latinos and immigrants,” Castro said. “He slandered the history of the United States and the country, and the way we were built.”
Castro also spoke about the need to improve education policies in the U.S. and increase college accessibility. Specifically, he cited the need to increase the amount of college counseling available to students, and make sure that all options for higher education are open to them.
“There are a lot of important things that happen outside the classroom but still inside the school,” he said. “We have to do a good job of broadening people’s horizons, getting them to apply to all of these wonderful places.”
Castro shared that the advice he gives to college counselors is to “always believe that the people that you’re advising and mentoring can achieve more things than you did,” adding that “people will artificially limit their horizons.”
Daniel S. Menz ’19 said that, while he thought the talk was rehearsed at points, Castro “was very sincere.”
The Castro brothers “have been such role models in their community, growing up in the situation that they did,” Menz said. “The talk really illustrated why we’re so privileged to be here.”
Anastacia M. Valdespino ’17 said she liked the breadth of issues Castro explored, some of which, “we don’t get to talk about or have the space to talk about.”
The large audience at the talk was “a testament to the rarity of this,” she added. “Not only that it is rare to have such a successful Latino in Congress, but to also have him come here.”
Castro’s talk opened the Harvard Kennedy School’s America Adelante Conference, taking place this weekend, which aims to bring together Latino students and political leaders and explore the implications of the growing Latino population in the U.S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: APRIL 1, 2016, at 3:50 p.m.
Harvard admitted a record-low 5.2 percent of applicants to the College’s Class of 2020, accepting 2,037 total students from a pool of more than 39,000 applicants and continuing a general decline in its admissions rate.
A total of 1,119 students received notifications of their regular decision acceptance Thursday evening through an online applicant portal. The full admitted class includes record-high percentages of African American and Asian American students and includes the 918 students who received offers of admission in December. Last year, Harvard admitted a then-historic 5.3 percent of students who applied. 
Fourteen percent of the admitted class is African American, rising slightly from 12.1 percent last year, and 22.1 percent of the class is Asian American, up from 21 percent. These increased percentages come as Harvard faces intensifying scrutiny over its admissions practices. Currently, a lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian American applicants remains on hold, and a group running for Harvard’s Board of Overseers requests Harvard be more transparent in how it considers race in its admissions practices. 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 attributed the slight increase in racial diversity in the admitted class to what he described as a “multiplier effect” thanks to Harvard’s efforts over the last decade to specifically recruit underrepresented groups of potential students through programs such as the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program and the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative.
“We’re certainly gratified to see everything going in the right direction, because we know there are lots of talented students from a variety of ethnic backgrounds who ought to be looking at this place,” he said in an interview Thursday. In a previous interview, Fitzsimmons acknowledged that “it’s hard to move the needle very far in one year” in terms of accepting minority students, despite aggressive recruiting from Harvard.
The economic diversity of this year’s admitted students has also increased, Fitzsimmons said, and a higher percentage of students than last year applied for financial aid and were eligible to have their application fee waived. About one-fifth of the Class of 2020 is expected to come from families with an annual income of $65,000 or less, thereby qualifying for Harvard’s new $2,000 “startup grant” to help freshmen with additional financial needs that may come up over the course of the year, Fitzsimmons said. 
“We have worked very, very hard over many, many years to increase the economic diversity of the student body,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that admissions officers publicize Harvard’s financial aid program extensively while traveling the country to speak to potential applicants.
Other measures of diversity within the accepted class of 2020 remain largely unchanged from last year. Admitted women represent a slight minority of accepted students, comprising 48.4 percent of those admitted, up from 48 percent last year.
The percentage of Latinos in the admitted class of 2020 fell from 13.3 percent to 12.7 percent. The percentage of first-generation students remained roughly the same as last year at 15 percent, Fitzsimmons said.
Following an upward trend, 16.9 percent of admitted students indicated they intend to concentrate in the humanities while at Harvard, up from 14.8 percent last year. Fitzsimmons said recent publicity surrounding the new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media and the reopening of the Harvard Art Museums may have contributed to the increased interest in humanities.
“So many exciting things have been going on here in the humanities, for a long time. Although the excellence has always been there, some of these very recent changes have caught people’s attention,” Fitzsimmons said.
Students also indicated greater interest in math, physical sciences, engineering, and computer science.
Visitas, Harvard’s weekend of programming for admitted students, is scheduled to run from April 16 to 18, and more than 1,400 students are expected to attend. Students have until May 1 to accept offers of admission.
Fitzsimmons praised this year’s applicants for what he said was their exceptional talent.
“This year, despite the fact that it was a relatively small percentage rise in applications, it seemed to us like the quality of the pool, any way you want to look at it, was quite unusual,” he said.
 Harvard’s acceptance rate of 5.2 percent was higher than the rate at Stanford, which admitted only 4.7 percent of applicants. Harvard’s percentage was lower, however, than those of its peers in the Ivy League: Yale accepted 6.3 percent, Princeton 6.5 percent, Columbia 6 percent, Brown 9 percent, the University of Pennsylvania 9.4 percent, Dartmouth 10.5 percent, and Cornell 14 percent.
The Crimson was granted an interview with Fitzsimmons and early access to admissions statistics under the condition that they not be published until Friday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard men’s tennis team entered Ivy League play at a comfortable No. 36 in its opening weekend against No. 55 Cornell and the defending Ivy Champion, No. 28 Columbia. In a hotly contested pair of matches, the Crimson split the weekend with a win over the Big Red and a loss to the Lions.
This year, Harvard enters Ivy play in a similar position: at No. 47, the Crimson (12-8, 0-0 Ivy) is ranked between No. 56 Cornell (7-9, 0-1) and No. 40 Columbia (11-5, 1-0), again the defending Ivy Champions.
For a chance at redemption against the Lions and to start its conference season on a strong note, Harvard will need to learn from its otherwise rocky season and harness the momentum from its past three victories.
“Especially in the last few weeks a lot of the guys have been playing really well and playing the right way,” freshman Andy Zhou said. “Our performances have been in line with what we expect, and I think that momentum and that positivity will be very important going into the rest of the season.”
The Crimson began its 2016 season with high hopes after ending its strong 2015 season just short of the Ivy League Championship title, finishing in second place with a 19-7, 5-2 record. Since then, however, the team has seen inconsistent results on the court, struggling to secure doubles points and seeing its ranking drop from No. 32 in preseason play to a season-low No. 50 last weekend.
Quite a bit changed last weekend, however. After a streak of unsuccessful efforts over spring break, the Crimson ended its time in San Diego with a decisive 4-1 victory over San Diego State. Back at home, the team overcame a tough double-header on Easter Sunday to upset Old Dominion 4-3 and handily take down Amherst, 5-2.
“We have had matches this season where we have had good individual performances, but we haven’t all played well too often. If we can keep committing to our games, we can definitely have a lot of success going into Ivy League play,” freshman Chris Morrow said.
This upward trend comes at a critical time for Harvard, as it will face tough competition in the Ivy League. The Crimson is currently fourth of the five Ivy teams ranked by the ITA, behind Columbia, Princeton, and Dartmouth.
Though Cornell, which the Crimson will play on Saturday in Ithaca, N.Y., is coming off a loss, the Big Red won Harvard and Cornell’s most recent matchup in the semifinals of the ECAC Indoor Championships this past February.
Even earlier this year, Harvard had a taste of the Big Red’s competition in the Ivy Plus tournament. Crimson sophomore Grant Solomon overcame Cornell’s Dylan Brown, while co-captain Nicky Hu bested Cornell senior Stefan Vinti.
Since then, however, Vinti has accumulated a team-leading eight singles victories, and will undoubtedly be a tough matchup for Harvard. Vinti enters the weekend with five wins in the past six matches, including the lone point for Cornell in its matchup against Columbia last weekend.
Columbia has won three of its last four matches and has bested the Crimson in season openers for the past two years.
The Lions senior Mike Vermeer leads the team with a 13-2 singles record, and No. 64 Lions junior Shawn Hadavi will also prove a threat. In a close three-set matchup last spring, Hadavi was just able to best Harvard’s then-sophomore Brian Yeung.
An added challenge this weekend on top of the highly competitive teams will be the disadvantage of playing away.
“To compete against not only the opponents directly across from you but also the home crowd is definitely something that we’ll have to take into account,” Zhou said. “We’ll have to be level-headed and make sure to manage all the environmental factors that could throw off our focus.”
Despite the opposition’s home court advantage, Harvard enters the weekend with confidence.
“Going into Ivy season we have a pretty strong assembly of doubles teams again and I have a lot of faith in the guys that we have playing singles,” Zhou said. “Personally, I’m very confident in the way I’ve been playing and I know what I need to do. All the tools are there, all the parts are set up, we just need to go out there on the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, a disallowed goal in the last minute of a close game handed the Harvard women’s lacrosse team a one-point loss against No. 10/11 Princeton. This Saturday, the Crimson (5-3, 1-1 Ivy League) looks to rebound as it faces Ivy League rival Dartmouth (5-3, 1-1) at Harvard Stadium.
“Princeton was a hard-fought game, and we were definitely disappointed with the outcome,” said co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd. “That said, we have put the past in the past and re-directed our attention towards Dartmouth this week.”
Harvard and Dartmouth have a storied rivalry, with the Crimson barely holding the advantage of the all-time series record, 21-20-1. The two first played in 1976 and most recently met last April, with Harvard claiming a narrow 9-8 victory.
In last year’s contest, the Crimson dominated the first half of the game, but nearly blew a five-point lead in the second period, as Dartmouth outscored Harvard, 5-1, and won seven of eight draw controls after halftime.
“Dartmouth gives 110 percent for the full 60 minutes,” Todd said. “Last year, we had a comfortable lead midway through the second half, but Dartmouth kept fighting, and the game’s outcome was not decided until the final few seconds of the game.”
Harvard and Dartmouth have historically been evenly-matched—the teams’ last two games were each decided by one point—and this year is no exception.
In fact, the two squads enter this weekend’s matchup with identical records for the season. Both come into the weekend with one win and one loss in conference play.
The Crimson and the Big Green both picked up their lone losses of the Ivy League season against Princeton. Despite outshooting the Tigers, 28-16, leading in draw controls, 9-4, and coming close on a last-second shot by junior midfielder Megan Hennessey, Harvard lost to Princeton by one point with a final score of 6-5.
The Tigers topped Dartmouth, 11-5, after the Princeton defense successfully keyed in on the Big Green’s leading scorer, senior Jaclyn Leto, preventing her from scoring even once.
In Dartmouth’s most recent contest, a 10-9 victory over No. 16/17 University of Pennsylvania, Leto scored six times and caused a Quaker turnover in the final seconds, preventing Penn from tying up the score.
The Chatham, N.J., native is currently ranked second in the NCAA for goals per game. She has racked up 150 points on 130 goals so far in her career, with 32 scores already this season. Focusing a stifling defense on Leto will be crucial to Harvard’s success against the Big Green on Saturday.
Heading into the matchup, the Crimson defense looks to be up to the task. Harvard’s back line has been formidable this season, and the Crimson is currently ranked 27th in the nation for scoring defense and 24th for scoring margin.
Co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis has been instrumental in the success of the Harvard defense. The senior has registered 56 saves this year and boasts the 15th-best save percentage in the NCAA. She is currently tied for third in career saves for the Crimson with 289.
The Crimson has a strong offensive line-up as well, with junior attacker Marisa Romeo, junior attacker Maeve McMahon, sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn, and senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia all reaching double digits in scoring. Romeo has collected a team-high 17 goals and 23 points this season, and the fact that she has scored in the team’s last six games likely means that Harvard will look to her to spark its offense on Saturday.
The result of this weekend’s game will have a serious bearing on the Ivy League standings. The Crimson and Dartmouth are currently in a three-way tie with Penn for fourth place in the Ancient Eight.
“After a tough end to the Princeton game, we’re that much more fired up to take it to Dartmouth right from the first draw,” freshman midfielder Caroline Garrity said. “Our focus is on beating Dartmouth, that’s it.”
At the end of the regular season, only the top four teams in the conference will advance to the Ivy League Tournament, meaning that the outcome of the Saturday’s matchup could have a major impact on each team’s title hopes.
“We are very much looking forward to Saturday’s contest,” Todd said. “The game has huge implications within the Ivy League, and we are very eager to show Dartmouth and the NCAA what Harvard is made of.”
