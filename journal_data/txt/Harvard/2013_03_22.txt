After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a job market still feeling the effects of a recession, more than 96 percent of Harvard Law School’s most recent alums secured a job nine months after graduation, marking a slight improvement over the previous graduating class.
As of mid-February, 568 of the 590 graduates of the Class of 2012 were employed, according to Mark A. Weber, assistant dean for career services at the Law School. The vast majority of these graduates, he said, are employed in full-time, long-term positions.
“No matter what the market, our students have always done well,” Weber said. “The reason our numbers are good is because we have a fantastic student body and employers want to hire our students.”
This year’s 96.27 percent employment rate is the Law School’s highest since 97.53 percent of the Class of 2009 found employment nine months after graduation, surpassing rates of 94.57 percent and 95.54 percent for the Class of 2010 and the Class of 2011, respectively.
“Even during the worse years, we were showing 95 percent employment. That’s a really good story,” Weber said. “Not only did we go up by almost a percentage point this year, at the same time we were funding fewer fellowships.”
The number of University- or Law School-funded positions dropped from 33 to 19 this year, providing jobs for more than 3 percent of graduates, relative to 5.66 percent the year before.
“During the downturn, we funded more folks to go into the public sector,” Weber said. “With the recession, the private sector was adversely impacted, and the public sector was affected even more. Schools were there to bridge that gap.”
This year, the drop in Harvard-sponsored positions reflects a stronger private sector that “absorbed more jobs,” Weber said.
More than 55 percent of members of the Class of 2012 found employment at law firms, an uptick of more than one percent over last year’s numbers, and just over 22 percent took up judicial clerkships.
The percentage of graduates engaged in government, public interest, or education work decreased this year, however. That figure dropped to under 14 percent for the most recent alums, a downswing from over 15 percent for the Class of 2011.
Starting salaries also increased slightly over last year. Members of the Class of 2012 are earning an average of $116,053, approximately $3,000 more than Class of 2011 graduates but about $3,600 less than Class of 2010 graduates.
“I was very pleased with the outcome, yet our work’s not done until everyone has a job,” Weber said in reflection on the data.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a thrilling 68-62 victory of the University of New Mexico Lobos, the Harvard Crimson advance to take on the sixth-seeded Arizona Wildcats in the next round. Staff writer David Freed breaks down the matchup from all angles.
 
Before starting the analysis, here’s a quick primer on Arizona.
***
Record: 26-7 (12-6 Pac-12)
Best Wins: Florida, Miami, San Diego State
Worst Losses: USC
RPI: 15
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 18
First Round Result: Beat 11th-seeded Belmont, 81-64
Star Players: Mark Lyons (Sr. Guard) 14.8 ppg, 3.0 apg, Nick Johnson (So. Guard) 11.7 ppg, 3.2 apg, 1.9 sph, Solomon Hill (Sr. Forard) 13.4 ppg, 5.3 rpg
Arizona is a hard team to get a read on. The Wildcats won their first 14 games of the year, including a one-point home victory over the fifth-ranked Florida Gators and a nineteen-point victory over the Miami Hurricanes (unranked at the time). The Wildcats proceeded to slip up during Pac-12 play, losing seven of their next 18 games—including three times to UCLA.
The Wildcats boast a roster full of tournament experience. Xavier transfer Lyons was a part of two Sweet Sixteen teams at his former school. He leads the team in scoring and is second on the team in assists, but is erratic at best. Lyons shoots just 42 percent from the floor and 32 percent from three and turns the ball over almost as much as he dishes out assists (1.1 assist to turnover ratio). Hill is a carryover from the Arizona team that made the Elite Eight with Derrick Williams, and can play inside and out as a power forward.
***
After getting past New Mexico, however, Harvard will be excited to draw Arizona in the next round. Detailed below, the Wildcats’ weaknesses match up well with Harvard’s strengths and unlike first-round foe New Mexico, its strengths do not line up directly with the Crimson’s weaknesses.
Common Opponents:
Harvard and Arizona share only one common opponent—the California Golden Bears. The Crimson defeated Cal in Berkeley on December 29th, 67-62, while Arizona lost at home to the Golden Bears on February 10th, 77-69. The Wildcats’ loss to Cal was mostly due to the stellar play of two Golden Bears—guards Justin Cobbs and Allen Crabbe. Cobbs and Crabbe combined for 52 points, 10 rebounds, nine assists, and two steals against Arizona. The Wildcats allowed the Golden Bears to shoot 59 percent but were able to hold the Cal frontcourt to a combined 20 points and eight rebounds. On the offensive side of the ball, the ’Cats shot poorly from the field (39 percent) and Hill and Lyons were mostly to blame. The two combined for 29 points but needed 26 shots to do so.
Cal was the only nonconference win of note on Harvard’s schedule this year, and the Crimson beat the Golden Bears playing almost the exact same strategy that Arizona employed in its loss—let Crabbe and Cobbs get their points and stop everyone else. The two guards combined for 42 points and 11 rebounds against the Crimson, making 17 of 31 shots. However, the rest of the team managed only 20 points on 22 shots. Harvard took care of the ball well on offense (only eight turnovers) and made the Golden Bears pay from the foul line, making all but one of their 14 attempts. Although they shot a similar percentage to Arizona (37 percent), the Crimson pulled out the victory with clutch play late and solid games from junior Laurent Rivard (19 points, five threes) and sophomore Wesley Saunders (18 points).
There is little to gleam from the two games. Both teams played Cal in similar manners and did little to contain Cobbs and Crabbe. This isn’t indicative of either team’s struggles depending the perimeter—the Crimson’s defensive problems lay inside and Arizona took down guard-heavy Florida by keeping them scoreless in the last 2:35 of the game.
Games against similar teams
Unlike New Mexico—whose height and size most closely resembled Ivy rival Princeton—Harvard has played few teams like Arizona. The Wildcats bring a mix of unique experience and athleticism they used to blow away the slower Bruins in round one. Since most Ancient Eight teams beat you with backdoor cuts and perimeter shooting, Harvard has played few teams in conference to prepare itself for the Wildcats. The Memphis Tigers, which Harvard lost to on Jan. 19, are the only comparable team on Harvard’s schedule. Memphis has perhaps the most athletic roster in the country but—like Arizona—is not a particularly good three point-shooting team. In that game, Harvard knotted the contest up late, 50-all, before freshman Siyani Chambers fouled out and the Tigers ended the game on a 10-0 run. Harvard’s performance is indicative of its dependence on Chambers and its ability to keep up with an athletic team like the Tigers bodes well for Saturday.
On the other side of the ball, Arizona has never really played a team quite like Harvard. The Crimson plays four guards who all shoot better from three than Arizona shoots as a team (36.3 percent). Florida, the only comparably guard-heavy team the Wildcats played, is vastly different from Harvard in athleticism and style. Little to learn here.
Advanced Metrics
Here is where Harvard’s hopes lie. Arizona allows opponents to shoot 36 percent from behind the arc. While they held Belmont—an excellent three-point shooting team—to under 30 percent in the first round, the Bruins were behind all game and launched threes from all parts of the court towards the end of regulation in an effort to make a comeback. Whereas New Mexico had the 21st best defense in the country according to Ken Pomeroy’s advanced metrics, Arizona’s is just 37th. For a Crimson squad that scored 68 points against the Lobos on just 42 shots, this is a good omen.
However, a lot of the round of 64 win was decided not with Harvard’s jump shots but the efforts of the Lobos shooters. Guards Hugh Greenwood, Kendall Williams, and Tony Snell combined to make only five of the 21 shots that they attempted and overall the Lobos made three of 14 three-point attempts. The Crimson shouldn’t rely on that happening with the Wildcats’ 18th-ranked offense. Sean Miller’s squad flashed solid ball movement against Belmont, going inside and out effectively. Center Kaleb Tarczewski had 12 points and eight rebounds and freed up Hill and Lyons on the perimeter (six threes made on 11 attempts between them).
ESPN’s Giant Killers model forecasts Harvard to have a 17.6 percent chance of beating the Wildcats come Saturday afternoon. The model’s concerns lie with Arizona’s ability to rebound the ball offensively, which will be exacerbated against the weak Harvard front line. The Crimson juggled three big men with three or four fouls for most of the second half against the Lobos and Smith and co. have a tendency to get into foul trouble, something they must avoid against the Wildcats. Johnson and Lyons will drive to the basket and challenge the Crimson inside time and time again. On the other side of the ball, Harvard will have to be even more efficient on the offensive side of the ball to keep up with the Wildcats. Although Arizona is inconsistent, it has shined in big moments this year (see its wins over the Gators and Hurricanes) and Harvard will need to mount another strong 40-minute performance to topple it Saturday. It’s main advantages lie with the three and Crimson fans will look to co-captains Rivard and senior Christian Webster to shine from deep again if Harvard is to make its inaugural Sweet Sixteen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The Harvard men’s basketball team had plenty of opportunities to let this one slip away.
And nobody would have blamed the Crimson if it had. After all, this wasn’t Dartmouth, Brown, or even Princeton that Harvard was sharing the court with. This was the University of New Mexico—the third-seeded, 10th-ranked Lobos.
So the Crimson wasn’t supposed to fight back when New Mexico opened the half on a 6-0 run to take its first lead of the game, nor when the Lobos went on a 6-0 run midway through the second half to grab a 49-47 lead with 7:53 to go.
But both times, the Crimson did.
And after a season of letting leads slip away, Harvard closed out the game when it mattered most, taking its NCAA opener, 68-62, in front of a national television audience Thursday night.
“What a sensational, gutsy effort by our team,” said Crimson coach Tommy Amaker moments after the victory, Harvard’s first postseason triumph in program history. “But I thought our toughness and courage carried us through with the belief that we had the opportunity in front of us.”
The Crimson first faced adversity late in the first half. After jumping out to a seven-point, 9-2 lead, the Lobos fought back to even the score at 16 with 6:19 remaining and at 18 with 5:13 to go.
The moment felt eerily similar to the Crimson’s last NCAA tournament appearance against Vanderbilt a year ago. With 5:28 remaining in the first half of that contest, 12th-seeded Harvard took a 20-17 advantage off a Christian Webster three-pointer.
That marked the last time that the Crimson led, as the Commodores answered with a crippling 16-3 run to close out the opening frame.
But this year was different.
After Lobos center Alex Kirk knotted the score at 18 with a layup, Harvard immediately answered on the other end. Rookie point guard Siyani Chambers drove to the basket and kicked it out to junior co-captain Laurent Rivard in the corner. Rivard drilled the triple and—after just 12 seconds—the Crimson was back in the lead.
Kirk responded with a bucket on the other end, but Harvard had another answer—this time courtesy of sophomore Wesley Saunders.
Saunders—who finished with a team high 18 points—finished at the basket for his third field goal of the frame.
Two Webster triples over the next 1:44 put the Crimson up by seven, and Harvard went into the break up by four, 31-27.
“We showed a lot of toughness tonight and persevering,” Webster said. “Whenever they made runs we fought back.”
The Crimson faced perhaps its biggest threat coming out of halftime when New Mexico opened the period on a 6-0 run to go up by two, 33-31—its first lead of the contest.
That advantage would only last for 12 seconds, as Harvard once again answered on the following possession with Webster drilling a deep three-pointer from the right wing.
The Lobos took back the lead with 7:53 to go off a Jamal Fenton three pointer, but once again the Crimson had an answer.
After a lengthy possession, Rivard was fouled with the shot clock winding down, and the junior proceeded to hit two free throws to even the score.
With 6:16 to play, Rivard nailed a corner triple off a pass from Chambers to give the Crimson the lead for good. Harvard went up by eight with 2:17 to play and its lead never dipped below four the rest of the way.
“I thought we played a really good 40 minutes,” Amaker said. “I thought the composure that our kids displayed was terrific.”
It was a fitting bookend to a season that opened with disappointment. In its Division I opener, Harvard fell to UMass at the buzzer after leading by five with 1:21 remaining. Nearly two months later at Saint Mary’s, the Crimson fell by one after leading by 10 with 3:56 to go.
But on Thursday, Harvard closed out its talented non-conference opponent.
“I think every time we learn from what we did wrong,” Rivard said. “Now we’re at the end of the season, and we had time to correct that, and we showed more toughness that we did during the season to close out this game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—Though the Harvard men’s basketball team was 2,500 miles away from Cambridge on Thursday night, familiar chants of “I believe that we will win” filled EnergySolutions Arena as the clock wound down.
Playing in front of a crowd of 14,345, the Crimson did what no Harvard team had done before, clinching the first NCAA tournament win in program history.
“I thought that our fans were amazing,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Our band, our cheerleaders, everyone was so enthused…. I thought that helped us get momentum.”
Matched up against No. 3-seed New Mexico—a team which many believed was poised to make a run to the Final Four—the Crimson took the lead early and controlled the pace, cementing the 68-62 victory with a pair of Wesley Saunders free throws with 18 seconds on the clock.
The win—also Harvard’s first over a team ranked in the top 10 by the Associated Press—came despite season-long adversity.
After seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry took a leave of absence at the start of the academic year, few were certain about how the team would adapt. Princeton was picked to win the league in the preseason coaches’ poll, and the Crimson’s roster was full of question marks.
But Harvard’s young lineup emerged in non-conference play, with freshman point guard Siyani Chambers running the court and Saunders, a sophomore, putting up big points. When the Crimson beat Princeton at home, it seemed poised to make a title run.
It wouldn’t come easily.
Two weeks later, Harvard fell to the Tigers on the road and was upset by Penn the next night, leaving Princeton in control of the Crimson’s fate. Going into the final weekend of Ivy League play, Harvard was forced to wait and hope as the Tigers dropped both contests and handed the Crimson the Ivy League title, sending the team to the tournament.
Though the Lobos were heavy favorites—considered by some to be under-seeded—Harvard came away with the surprise win and cemented its place in program history.
MAKING IT BIG
At the end of the first half, the Lobos had gone to the line 11 times. The Crimson had yet to draw a shooting foul.
New Mexico used its size and strength inside to create foul trouble for Harvard’s bigs, especially sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith, who finished the first half with three personal fouls. After Smith got his fourth five minutes into the second half, he went to the bench for the next eight minutes.
Smith re-entered the game with seven minutes on the clock and fouled out six minutes later, but during that time he made his presence felt. He added four of his ten points down the stretch—a driving shot on Lobos center Alex Kirk and two free throws—and swatted a Kirk layup that would have brought the Lobos within four.
“He had a huge block that energized our team,” Amaker said. “Those are the plays we know he’s capable of making…. We called on him after sitting for a long period of time and he responded well.”
Smith wasn’t the only one who had to play through foul trouble. Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi had two fouls in the first half and fouled out with 20 seconds to play, and sophomore forward Jonah Travis ended the game with four.
Despite the height difference, the 6’8” Smith and the 6’7” Moundou-Missi showed no hesitation driving on the seven-foot Kirk. The two combined for 15 points on six-for-12 shooting in the paint.
Because of the early foul trouble, Amaker was forced to use his three bigs in rotation and put them back into the game with four fouls—balancing maintaining defensive pressure with keeping his players in the game for as long as possible.
“We were juggling a little bit deciding who we wanted on the floor and saving a certain guy here, saved Yat for that, then Steve, then Jonah,” Amaker said. “Our guys performed well, and we had to talk to them about playing as if they didn’t have four fouls. Sometimes when you’re in foul trouble, you play passive. We needed to maintain a certain aggression.”
REIGNING THREES
In his second consecutive tournament, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard made his presence known.
In last season’s loss to Vanderbilt in the second round, Rivard’s clutch three-point shooting down the stretch kept Harvard in contention, as he led the team with 20 points.
But this year, the guard’s heroics paid off for the Crimson. Rivard opened up the first half hot, contributing on both ends and leading the team with nine points and four rebounds—all on defense. With 14 minutes to play, Rivard received a pass from Chambers on the wing and drained his first three of the night from in front of the Lobos bench—breaking Harvard’s single-season record with his 75th trey this year and putting the Crimson up by five.
Rivard benefited from Harvard’s inside-out strategy, hitting his second triple of the night when Saunders collected two defenders inside the key and fed the ball out to Rivard on the left wing.
“Any successful team has to have balance inside and out, and [the interior] play helped open up things for Laurent and I,” said co-captain Christian Webster, who added three triples of his own. “We were open and they were really unselfish inside.”
After adding one more in the first and another to open the second, Rivard’s final three of the night came with six minutes to play. Kirk hit back-to-back free throws to give the Lobos a one-point lead, but Rivard came back to give Harvard the lead that would carry the team to the end of the game.
While Rivard added 17 points on five-of-nine shooting from the field, Amaker also credited his composure and tough defense as a major factor in the Crimson’s victory.
Down two with just over seven minutes to play, Rivard drew the foul from deep as the clock wound down and sunk two of three free throws to tie up the score at 49. The guard came down with five rebounds and added two steals.
“Because he is such a deep threat from the shot, there are times where he has used the shot fake very effectively,” Amaker said. “He is guarding players that are a lot bigger than he is. For him to stick his nose in there and be tough around the basket, that says a lot about how scrappy and tough he can become when we need that against bigger players inside.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After making history last year by becoming the first Ivy team to record a victory in the WNIT, the Harvard women’s basketball team wasn’t satisfied.
On Thursday night at Chase Family Arena, the Crimson (21-8, 11-3 Ivy), saved by a clutch performance from senior Elle Hagedorn, survived a flurry of turnovers and poor three-point shooting to best Hartford (21-12, 10-6 American East), 61-57.
“We’re thrilled to win,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We started our season by scrimmaging them, so we knew what kind of battle it was going to be, and our teams are similar in so many ways, and it was exactly the kind of game I expected it to be. I’m thrilled to get out of here with a win, because I think [Hawks coach] Jen [Rizzotti] does a great job. I think Hartford’s a great program, and they’re a tough, physical team.”
With 1:15 remaining in the game, a 6-0 run had given the Crimson an eight point lead over the Hawks. But Hartford wasn’t close to giving up. Forward Christie Michals grabbed a cross-court pass from her teammate, stepped behind the line, and sunk a three.
Rutzen then attempted to inbound the ball, but guard Amber Bepko intercepted the pass. After a Hawks timeout, guard Shanise Bultron inbounded to Michals, who pivoted, looked around for an open teammate, then pulled up for a long trey, prompting a Crimson timeout.
On the next possession, Hagedorn grabbed the rebound off her own missed trey and tossed in a layup to extend the lead to four. Rutzen redeemed herself on the next play, stealing an inbounds pass to hang on for the win.
“I think we’ve really been playing our best basketball here at the end of the season, so we felt really ready going into the game tonight, on a winning streak and not ready for the season to be over,” senior forward Victoria Lippert said. “So we just really put it together and grinded out the win tonight.”
Harvard struggled to inbound the ball during the entire game, as Hartford employed a full-court press and tough man-to-man defense to force 21 turnovers, 13 of which came in the first half.
“Their gameplan was to take the point guard out of the system,” Delaney-Smith said. “They took 14, 15 seconds off the shot clock almost every possession—not a lot of teams do that to us because I can have any number of guards bring the ball up, but I give credit to Hartford. I thought their gameplan was good, and it did take us out of our rhythm a little bit.”
Both teams grappled to find offensive momentum in the first half, with each shooting around 33 percent to start the game. The Hawks took a hit to their offensive output when forward Katie Roth, who recorded Hartford’s first three buckets, went down on the court five minutes into the game. She would sit out the remainder of the contest.
“Sometimes shots don’t fall, and that’s how it kind of was in the first half,” Lippert said. “We don’t let that bother us, it’s really all about defense and keeping up our defensive intensity, and we know that we’re going to hit the shots. We have so many offensive weapons, so I think we were able to hit more in the second half down the line when it really mattered. I think that’s what got us the win.”
The first half became a contest of strengths, as the teams traded hotly contested shots. The Crimson created a four-point lead with a put-back from senior forward Victoria Lippert, the largest lead of the first half, but the Hawks had an answer to every shot. Hartford closed the half with a 6-2 run, working off treys from Bultron and Michals to enter the locker room with a two-point lead.
Harvard came out of the break with a hot hand, beginning the half with a 8-1 run. Lippert, after recording double figures in the last three games, put up 13 points in the second half to help the visitors take the lead with 7:50 left, an advantage Harvard would not relinquish.
Junior guard Christine Clark, following up on her 22-point performance against Cornell to secure the WNIT bid, recorded her sixth career double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.
“I think that’s Vic and I’s roles on the team, to be those leaders in those categories,” Clark said. “Our teammates do a tremendous job of getting us the ball, especially in crunch situation, so everything goes towards our teammates, not towards us."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard men's basketball team topped the University of New Mexico on Thursday night, it's time for the Crimson to turn its attention to its next opponent: the University of Arizona. To get the inside scoop on the Wildcats, we caught up with Kevin Zimmerman of Arizona Desert Swarm.
THC: What should Harvard expect from Arizona? What are the team’s strengths and weaknesses?
KZ: Arizona's biggest asset is their size, and because of it they'll rely on their defense to make a run in the tournament. The freshmen crop of starting center Kaleb Tarczewski and bench forwards Brandon Ashley and Grant Jerrett provides one of the better interior defenses around the nation, and that also allows the perimeter players more room for error in playing Sean Miller's aggressive man defense.
Offensively, the Wildcats can be hit-or-miss. Senior Mark Lyons, a transfer from Xavier, is far from a true point guard and is sometimes a frustrating chucker of out-of-rhythm threes. Shooting guard Nick Johnson and combo forward Solomon Hill can make up in the playmaking department, but there is no go-to scorer for the Wildcats (I don't consider Lyons as that because he's a volume shooter) but any one of Lyons, Johnson or Hill could go off.
THC: What did teams like USC and Utah do to beat (or almost beat) the Wildcats? What will it take for Harvard to pull it off?
KZ: Both of those teams disrupted the offensive rhythm (Arizona gets stagnant against zone defenses, but a good man will suffice) and kept it in the halfcourt. In my opinion, Belmont struggled so poorly because it was a fast-paced team, and that played into a more athletic UA squad's hands. Going back to UA's lack of a true point guard,
Harvard must make the ball stick. And they also have to take what's given them on offense without forcing the issue. If Harvard does that, it should be in good shape, as Arizona really isn't a team to go on backbreaking runs against any opponent.
Also, I think Harvard needs to pick a poison. Either let the freshmen bigs win the game for the Wildcats, or pack the paint and force Arizona into open but questionable three-pointers—that baiting is why the Wildcats struggle against zones.
THC: Could you talk about Mark Lyons? What makes him effective?
 
KZ: For Arizona fans, Mark Lyons is very frustrating to watch. Not only is he not a true point guard, but he's seemingly oblivious to what's a good and what's a bad play. He's apt to bringing the ball up the court and cranking a three-pointer without a single pass, for example. He also forces a lot of things in trying to find gaps in defenses. On the plus side, he's fearless in attacking the rim, and if there aren't shot blockers waiting for him, he's able to score in the paint because of his speed and athleticism. If the game is on the line, expect him to want the ball.
He's also a pretty good spot-up shooter from deep, but again, it goes back to good versus bad attempts.
THC: What was Arizona’s attitude heading into the tournament? Did the team and its fans think the committee underseeded them?
 Oddly enough, I think people were satisfied with the West Region placement more than worried about the actual seed. I personally think this Arizona team can beat anyone in the nation, but they deserve the seeding because at no point during the season have looked to be as dominant as their potential might be. Because of that, a lot of Arizona fans didn't think the Wildcats would go anywhere in the tournament. That's also probably why seemingly every national media member thought Belmont could pull off an upset. As good as the Wildcats are, and as big as the advantage against Harvard they might have, there's always a chance they go back into the midseason lull that included the near-Utah win and USC loss that you mentioned.
THC: Harvard has struggled against opposing big men all season. Could you tell me a little bit about Tarczewski? What sort of skills does he have?
Tarczewski is really coming on of late. He's pretty athletic, agile and strong for a freshman, and at the least he'll grab eight boards a night. He's not really a great shot-blocker, but he does alter more inside shots than the numbers might suggest. Offensively, I'd expect Arizona will continue to feed him in the post to play inside-out. He has a true back-to-the-basket game that has really set up a lot of outside shots for Arizona of late.
Jerrett and Ashley are also plenty capable of causing problems, but all three are quite different players.
THC: How has Arizona's season thus far stacked up to the expectations coming into the year?
KZ: It's about as expected. I don't think anyone really knew how much of a question-mark Lyons would be. So far, it's been quite the roller coaster from the Arizona perspective. Everyone expects a couple wins in the tournament each year, and the win against Belmont was the first step into meeting those expectations. Again, I'm sure a lot of people thought this team could be Final Four worthy in the preseason, but those expectations were tempered a tad bit through a stressful feeling regular season (as stressful as losing seven games can be). In other words, a Harvard win would probably elicit more "I saw that coming this whole season" rather than complete surprise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in Los Angeles, sophomore Crimson wing Wesley Saunders grew up in the heart of Pac-12 country. Saunders, who said he lived “five minutes from USC,” never was a big fan of any of the conference’s squads growing up. Saunders considered both USC and the University of Colorado before selecting Harvard for college. But the sophomore was also interested in one of the conference’s premier programs and Harvard’s Saturday opponent—the Arizona Wildcats (26-7, 12-6 Pac-12)—in high school.
“He came to our elite camp, and he was a good young player,” Wildcats coach Sean Miller said. “We watched him a lot, and he was on several teams that we watch quite a bit in the summer. So we’re familiar with him.”
But Saunders was never offered a scholarship by the Wildcats, whose Class of 2014 recruiting class ranked seventh in the country. Miller instead offered scholarships to five-star recruits Josiah Turner and Nick Johnson, both of whom, like Saunders, can play both guard positions. While Turner was suspended for some of his freshman season for violating team rules and eventually transferred, Johnson was second on the team in scoring as a sophomore.
Saunders, who was a three-star recruit himself, will likely match up with Johnson on the court Saturday. In his second year for the Crimson, Saunders averages 16.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 3.4 assists a game. He shot 54 percent from the field and 50 percent from deep, scoring in double figures in every game for the Crimson. Johnson has averaged nearly 12 points for the Wildcats, adding 3.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists a game and shooting 45 percent from the field and 38 percent from behind the arc.
Saunders said that what elevated Harvard above larger, more prestigious programs like those of the Trojans and the Buffaloes were the well-rounded aspect of the school and the recruiting pitch of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker.
“I thought Harvard was the best of both worlds,” Saunders said. “It had the academics already and the athletics were on the upswing. [Amaker] lets our program speak for itself. He is honest in his recruiting.”
“Amaker is a great coach and I couldn’t ask to be in a better program,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning the first round of the tournament, the Crimson will take on the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday (6:10 EDT, TNT) in the round of 32. With a Sweet Sixteen bid on the line, staff writer David Freed breaks down the individual matchups at stake for the Crimson. 
 
As detailed in the previous part of the preview, the Crimson stands a better chance against the Wildcats than it did against New Mexico. While all the odds were thrown out the window in Harvard’s 68-62 victory over the Lobos, the Crimson match up better with the smaller, less defensive-minded Wildcats.
 
Point Guard: Siyani Chambers vs. Mark Lyons
The individual battle that leaps off the page is the freshman Chambers against the senior Lyons. This will be Lyons’ ninth tournament game and Chambers’ second. Lyons plays in a tougher conference for a team ranked 75 spots ahead of Harvard by Ken Pomeroy, but the statistics favor Chambers. The senior is an excellent free throw shooter (85 percent), but from the field (42 percent) and the arc (32 percent), he is below average. Chambers, in addition to being Harvard’s floor general and emotional leader, shoots 44 percent from both the field and deep. Although both guards turn it over at a similar rate (2.8 per game for Lyons, 3.4 for Chambers), Chambers averages nearly three more assists per contest and has a better assist to turnover ratio (1.7 to 1.1).
The key will be Chambers' ability to beat Lyons off the dribble. Lyons got to the hoop at will against bigger Belmont guards, using his speed to get past the slower Bruins. He is excellent at using his body to create space between defenders and intentionally drawing contact to prevent shot-blockers from rejecting his attempts. Chambers will need to stay in front of the Xavier transfer and make him take shots from three, where the Crimson can live with the occasional make. On the offensive side of the ball, Chambers must do the opposite to Lyons—crashing into the lane at will and opening up avenues for Harvard’s shooters on the outside.
Shooting Guard: Wesley Saunders vs. Nick Johnson
If neither coach shuffles around their lineups to adjust for his opponent, this is a matchup Harvard has a chance to dominate. Johnson is not a large two guard at 6'3" and 200 pounds, and will be going up against Saunders, who, in addition to being the Crimson’s best defender, is Harvard’s best player off the dribble and excels at absorbing contact and creating space in midair. Johnson will have a hard time stopping Saunders from driving past him without help—help that Arizona can ill afford to give with the shooters surrounding Saunders.
Johnson is an excellent shot in his own right, however. The sophomore marksman hits more than 37 percent of his threes and nearly 45 percent of his shots overall. He scored in double figures in 17 of the Wildcats’ first 20 games and is a more efficient and complete scorer than Lyons. He will test Saunders’ ability to challenge shots on the perimeter. To get Johnson open looks, Wildcat coach Sean Miller will likely run Saunders ragged through a number of off-ball screens. If Johnson can take advantage and stretch the floor, it will add yet another dimension to the Wildcat offense.
Small Forward: Laurent Rivard vs. Kevin Parrom
Rivard followed up his stellar 2012 introduction to tournament play (20 points, six of seven from behind the arc) with a 17-point performance against the Lobos. His early treys gave Harvard momentum and he stopped a New Mexico run by drawing a foul on a three-pointer attempt just before the under-eight-minutes media timeout in the second half. Rivard’s three-point shooting keys the Crimson offense, opening up the floor for drives by Chambers and Saunders. When he gets going, the team is hard to beat. It’s no coincidence that Rivard has made four or more threes in each of Harvard’s biggest four wins (California, New Mexico, vs. Princeton, vs. Cornell).
Parrom, a rangy 6'6" wing from the Bronx, will try to outmuscle Rivard and knock him off his spots on the floor. New Mexico’s Cameron Bairstow admitted after the game he lost track of the Quebec native twice in the corners, leading to open looks Rivard knocked down. Parrom cannot let that happen and must force Rivard to pass the ball. On the offensive end, the stronger Wildcat can most effectively attack Rivard by posting up and attacking the smaller Crimson defender in isolation.
Power Forward: Christian Webster vs. Solomon Hill
In a matchup of two seniors, the ability of both to rebound will be crucial to the outcome of the game. Webster is not a prolific rebounder—the Washington, D.C. native averages only three a game—but will have to mitigate Hill’s effect on the boards by effectively boxing out. Hill averages just five rebounds this season but averaged 7.7 a year ago. Against the smaller Webster, Hill will have a chance to dominate the interior against a weak rebounding Crimson squad. If he can do so, Arizona can get away with going big on offense, which allows it to match up better with the Crimson shooters on defense. Webster recently passed 1,000 total points for his career and is a prolific three-point shooting threat the Wildcats will need to account for. He tends to drift to the corner for kick-outs from Chambers and Saunders and, much like Parrom, Hill must take away those corner threes for the Wildcats to execute its game plan on defense.
Center: Kenyatta Smith vs. Kaleb Tarczewski
Harvard doesn’t face the size disadvantage against the Wildcats across the board that it did against the Lobos but Tarczewski may evoke memories of the Lobos’ seven-foot interior terror, Alex Kirk. The freshman averages only seven points a game but had 12 against Belmont and didn’t miss a shot from the floor against the undersized front line of the Bruins. Smith was the only Crimson defender strong enough to stand up to Kirk in the round of 64, and Harvard will count on him to stay out of foul trouble and counter a second seven-footer against Arizona. Smith’s defensive rebounding and block percentages, according to Ken Pomeroy, would be best in the country if he had enough minutes to qualify and he is an excellent interior defender. Tarczewski benefits from guards that can drive the lane at will, setting him up with easy looks. It will be up to Smith to seal off the lane and force Tarczewski and the Wildcat guards away from the basket, forcing them to beat the Crimson on the perimeter. If the sophomore can do that, Harvard will nullify one of the strongest parts of the Wildcat offense.
Bench
As with most every matchup, the Crimson are at a disadvantage when it comes to bench play. Coach Tommy Amaker is not shy about running his big dogs (Saunders, Chambers, Rivard, etc.) 35 or more minutes a game if the situation depends on it, and there is no true guard to back any of them up. Sophomore big men Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis help spell Smith on the interior and allow Amaker to experiment with two-big lineups, but the rotation is capped at seven. The Wildcats, by contrast, have nine players who have played in at least 27 games this season. Forwards Brandon Ashley and Grant Jerrett provide valuable bench minutes for Miller, helping to spell Tarczewski, who only plays about 22 minutes a game. Jerrett is the best three-point shooting threat the Wildcats have at 41 percent and little-used Gabe York also provides 35 percent accuracy from deep for Sean Miller.
With two guard-heavy teams taking the court on Saturday, the battle will be decided on the perimeter. To slow down the potent Wildcat attack and keep the quick Arizona guards in front of them, Harvard needs Chambers and Saunders to dominate their matchups against Lyons and Johnson, respectively. For Arizona, the key will be for Hill and Tarczewski to beat the Crimson to loose balls and win the rebounding battle. Harvard is one of the worst rebounding teams in the country and if the Wildcats can exploit that, they can extend possessions and test the occasionally impatient Crimson perimeter defenders. Each team has a simple blueprint for success; to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, one must simply out-execute the other.

CORRECTIONS: March 23, 2013
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Harvard guard Wesley Saunders was the Ivy League Player of the Year for the 2012-2013 season. In fact, that honor went to Princeton senior forward Ian Hummer. The post also incorrectly stated that the Crimson's Saturday NCAA tournament game against Arizona will begin at 6:10 p.m. EST. In fact the game begins at 6:10 p.m EDT.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The Harvard men’s basketball team surprised many by being back at EnergySolutions Arena on Friday for a press conference and closed practice.
After upsetting No. 3 New Mexico on Thursday night, the Crimson returned to prepare for its matchup against No. 6 Arizona on Saturday afternoon.
Like on Wednesday, co-captains Christian Webster and Laurent Rivard joined top scoring sophomore Wesley Saunders on stage to discuss the win—Harvard’s first both in the NCAA tournament and over an AP top 10 team—and the upcoming third round-game. Following his players, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker fielded questions from the media.
Given the historic nature of Harvard’s win, many of the questions focused on what the victory meant for the program as a whole. The players discussed their moment in the spotlight and how it has affected Harvard’s reputation on the national stage.
“It’s kind of nice to break the stereotype that we’re the nerdy kids and show people that we can play basketball as well,” said Saunders, who added that he chose Harvard because of the balance between its established academic reputation and up-and-coming athletic program.
“It’s nice that people don’t think of us as nerds,” Rivard added. “Everybody at Harvard—not just the basketball team but everybody—has talents other than being smart. It’s just fun to get that kind of attention.”
The players said that after the game they were contacted by a number of Harvard basketball alumni, including Jeremy Lin ’10 and last year’s co-captains, Oliver McNally ’12 and Keith Wright ’12—who stayed up to watch the game in Sweden, where he plays professional basketball for Uppsala Basket. Amaker added that he heard from the president—pausing before he specified that he was referring to Harvard University President Drew Faust—who called from South Korea to congratulate him on the win.
After Arizona coach Sean Miller talked about Pac-12 recruiting, Amaker also addressed his recruiting strategy when asked what he had to overcome to build a successful program at an Ivy League institution.
“[Harvard] is an incredible brand,” Amaker said. “It’s not about overcoming anything. It’s about presenting what you have. I think if you get a chance to do that with an opportunity like Harvard, for the right kids, the right situation, it can be something meaningful. We have been fortunate to get these kids to see that and I think to fall in love with that.”
When the questions turned to the adversity that the program has faced this season with a young lineup and the loss of Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry at the start of the year, Amaker seemed ready to move forward. He commended his players for their ability to adapt throughout the season given the circumstances, especially his young frontline.
Yesterday Amaker was forced to juggle the sophomore trio of Jonah Travis, Kenyatta Smith, and Steve Moundou-Missi, as New Mexico created foul trouble. Going up against Arizona—which, like the Lobos, plays a seven-foot center—the young bigs will be equally important.
“We don’t need them to do a lot,” Amaker said. “We just need them to be solid in a few areas. I think if you break it down and simplify it like that, it gives them a chance to be confident in just a few things. As the game went on for us yesterday, you could see the confidence growing in our young big guys up front.”
Rivard added that the frontline’s play contributed to his ability to find open shots on the perimeter. The junior guard went five-for-nine from three and hit two clutch free throws down the stretch—after drawing the foul from deep—to tie the score at 49 after the Crimson fell behind in the second half. Thursday night was the second time Rivard was hot from the perimeter in a tournament game. Last season, the junior went six-for-seven in the Crimson’s loss to Vanderbilt.
“Honestly, whenever I go to the gym I always see Laurent in there,” Saunders said. “He’s always the first one in there and the last one to leave. It’s not really a mystery why he’s such a good shooter.”
Discussing the matchup against Harvard, Miller commended Harvard’s ability to get to the line. Last night the Crimson uncharacteristically did not shoot a free throw in the first half. The team—which averages 16.9 made free throws per game—finished the game with 16 free throws, all coming in the second half.
The team said it would draw on its experience playing back-to-back games in the Ivy League to prepare for Saturday’s game on one day of rest. After celebrating last night, the team met this morning to refocus, and had practice that was closed to the media following the press conferences.
“During the Ivy League season, we would win or lose on Friday night, and we had to turn the page whether we felt good about how we played or not,” Rivard said. “That’s what we’re doing today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—There is not much time to celebrate in the NCAA Tournament.
The Harvard men’s basketball team learned that Friday, when following the jubilation of Thursday night’s stunning victory over New Mexico, the Crimson had to quickly refocus and get set to play No. 6 seed Arizona Saturday at 6:10 ET on TNT.
“The celebration ended this morning,” co-captain Christian Webster said Friday.
The Pac-12’s Wildcats, ranked No. 21 in the most recent Associated Press top 25 poll, reached the third round by dominating Belmont, 81-64. Now they will face a confident Crimson squad whose win over the Lobos made it the talk of the college basketball world Thursday night.
“We know we’re in for a fight,” Arizona coach Sean Miller said. “When you win a game like that it doesn’t just all of a sudden leave you. Many times it carries through for the rest of the weekend.”
It has been an up-and-down season for the Wildcats, which won their first 14 games—including victories over Florida, Miami, and San Diego State—to reach as high as No. 3 in the national rankings. But Arizona underachieved in conference play, closing the regular season with a 5-5 record and then losing to UCLA for the third time this year in the Pac-12 semifinals.
Despite the Wildcats' late season inconsistency, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker made clear that winning a second tournament game will be no easy task.
“[This will be a] huge challenge,” Amaker said. “Arizona is talented and big and athletic across the board.”
Like the Lobos, the Wildcats feature a balanced offensive attack. Senior Mark Lyons—playing his first year with Arizona after transferring from Xavier—led the team in scoring with 15 points per game and poured in a team-high 23 points against the Bruins. The point guard will pose a second consecutive challenging matchup for Crimson freshman Siyani Chambers, who limited New Mexico star Kendall Williams to just eight points on one for six shooting.
Senior Solomon Hill, who like Lyons was named First Team All Pac-12, contributed 13.3 points and 5.3 rebounds per contest, while sophomore guard Nick Johnson added 11.7 points per game for the Wildcats.
Arizona, like Harvard, is young inside. Seven-foot freshman Kaleb Tarczewski—a consensus top-ten recruit in the country coming into the season—led Arizona with 6.1 rebounds per game, while classmates Brandon Ashley and Grant Jerrett have contributed valuable minutes off the bench.
“Obviously [the Crimson is] a great team,” Tarczewski said. “It’s going to be a challenge for us. We’re prepared for that.”
In order to defend the Wildcats’ frontline, Harvard’s rotation of sophomore big men—Kenyatta Smith, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Jonah Travis—must stay out of foul trouble. The trio failed to do that against the Lobos, as the former two players fouled out and Travis collected four fouls. When Smith was not on the court, New Mexico seven-footer Alex Kirk was able to use his size to overpower Harvard with relative ease.
“We’re young up front,” Amaker said. “We don’t need [our big men] to do a lot. We just need them to be solid in a few areas.”
Arizona is also significantly better at defending the three than New Mexico, meaning the Crimson sharpshooting duo of co-captains Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster—who were a combined eight for 14 from deep Thursday—could have a tougher time getting good looks.
“You could see [last night] what makes [Harvard] good,” Hill said. “They have great shooters. They like to space the floor. They have a great point guard who likes to find guys in transition, and they have a five-man who can battle in the post.”
The Wildcats are a team that the Crimson does not want to put on the line, as Arizona ranks in the top 25 in the country in free-throw percentage. Harvard, which entered the tournament ranked second nationally in free throw rate, will also look to get to the charity stripe against Arizona more often than it did against the Lobos, when it failed to attempt a free throw in the first half.
“[Getting to the line was] something we’ve tried to do all year,” Saunders said. “So it’s something that moving forward we will definitely want to try to do.”
The teams have one common opponent this season—fellow tournament team California. Harvard knocked off the Golden Bears, 67-62, in Berkley on Dec. 29, while Cal defeated conference rival Arizona, 66-62, in Tucson a month later.
The Wildcats thus insisted they would not be taking the Crimson lightly.
“For us to let down at all or take a deep breath because we’re playing a 14 seed would be foolish,” Miller said. “Harvard has proved, not only in this year but in recent years, that they can beat anybody on a given night, especially on a neutral court.”
And with a Sweet 16 birth on the line, the stakes are immense for both squads.
“No seed matters [anymore],” Miller said. “It’s about Arizona being at its very best, doing the things we do...being ready to go, knowing that we have to play a great game. If anything happens less than that, we’re going to go home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five was the magic number for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team Tuesday as it earned its first win this year in the fifth game of its season against Marquette. Captain Micaela Cyr drilled a game-high five goals and handed out one assist for six points. The tallies tie the midfielder’s career high.
“[Cyr]’s sneaky,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “She flies into space really well. She took advantage of people by making fakes and her teammates found her. She’s crafty off the ball.”
The Crimson (1-4, 0-2 Ivy) stormed past the Golden Eagles (2-6) for a convincing win, 18-4, at Valley Fields.
After several dropped games with a quiet offense, Harvard players outshot Marquette, 35-9.
“I feel we ran our offense well,” Miller said. “We’re pretty balanced and I think when we stay in it a lot of different people are able to get shots off. I think one of the things that helped us in that game is that we cleared the ball pretty well too so our offense had more opportunities.’
Senior midfielder Danielle Tetrault provided seven shots, with five on goal and four evading Golden Eagle goaltenders Sarah Priem and Emma Salter.
“I thought Danielle had a lot of opportunities off the dodge,” Miller said. “I thought she went right and left so she gave herself more opportunities by going both ways.”
Cyr followed her teammate with six shots and freshman attack Alexis Nicolia was close behind with five.
The Crimson ran out to an early lead, with Tetrault drilling the first score of the contest just two minutes in. Harvard would score four more times before Marquette made it onto the board.
“I think we got through our systems better,” Cyr said. “We were moving the ball and getting long possessions. A lot of different people scored, which was good, and once we got that lead we started rotating people in.”
The Golden Eagles were held to just one goal through the first frame, which came almost ten minutes into the period. A foul on Harvard senior midfield Mariel Jenkins, who had a career-record and game-high four ground balls during the game, caused a valid clear attempt by Marquette. Golden Eagle freshman Hayley Baas capitalized on the turnover to connect with the back of the net on an unassisted goal.
But the Crimson was quick to respond, as Cyr won a draw control and soon snapped the ball into the net for her second goal. Cyr’s goal began a 7-0 run for Harvard that gave the team an 11-point edge at the half.
Though Marquette was able to notch three scores in the second half, it was too late for the Golden Eagles as the Crimson stretched its advantage to as large as 13 early in the closing stanza.
In a true team effort, nine Harvard players scored a goal for the team during the game and seven had multiple points.
Conversely, only four players from Marquette made it onto the scoreboard and just one player had more than one point, freshman attack Claire Costanza, who had one point and two assists. The defensive unit was crucial in thwarting potential goal opportunities by the Golden Eagle attack.
“I think [the defensemen] are good on ball and they worked well together so they collapse the space well,” Miller said. “I think they’ve been doing a nice job.”
The victory snaps a four game losing streak that saw the Crimson open its season without a win.
“If everybody contributes we’re even better and more difficult to mark,” Miller said. ”The more people willing to contribute, the better you are because you’re more difficult to defend.”

It's not every day you see Laurent Rivard and Siyani Chambers on ESPN's homepage. Then again, it's not every day they contribute to the Harvard men's basketball program's first-ever NCAA tournament victory and, in the process, mess up everyone's brackets.
