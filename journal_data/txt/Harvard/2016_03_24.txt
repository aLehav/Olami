After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An option is a financial security that gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset—anything from a share of a company to a bushel of corn—at a fixed price on some future date, known as the expiration date. Options are among the simplest examples of financial derivatives: securities that derive their value from the value of other assets.
Despite the simplicity of options, pinning down their value is in fact immensely difficult. After all, determining how much a right to do something should be worth seems like a problem of philosophy, not finance. But in 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes were able to put a price on an option under certain mathematical assumptions; in doing so, they revolutionized the financial industry in theory and in practice, and won a Nobel Prize along the way.
We can think of options in a broad sense as objects that are worth something to us in certain states of the world and nothing to us in others. Imagine we owned an option to buy a Clover sandwich for $10 a month from now. If a catastrophic chickpea fritter harvest drove the price of a sandwich to $15 by the option’s expiration date, a diehard Clover fan would be willing to buy the option from you for up to $5 at that time. On the other hand, if sandwiches were being sold for less than $10 a month from now, the same option would be worthless. In no case could this option make us worse off: We exploit our right to act only when doing so is beneficial, and with no obligations, we otherwise pretend we never had the option to begin with and maintain our status quo.
The Black-Scholes equation shows that the asymmetric payoff intrinsic to options makes them more valuable when the dispersion of potential outcomes—what is known as volatility—increases. Since an option limits our worst-case scenario, we would rather face, loosely speaking, more uncertainty than less when we own one. For example, our Clover option is much more valuable when a sandwich has equal chance of being sold for $15 or $5 next month, than when a sandwich has equal chance of being sold for $11 or $9. In either case, having the option costs us nothing half the time when the sandwich is sold for less than $10, but when the sandwich is sold for more, we could save $5 instead of $1.
An option is therefore a multifaceted bet. It represents a gamble not only on the direction in which the price of an asset will move, but also the magnitude of such a move. (In contrast, purely directional bets on price movements are more elegantly expressed by simply buying or selling the asset in question). And unlike participants in options markets, who speculate on but cannot influence volatility, we sometimes face option-like payouts on real-world outcomes whose volatility we can in fact control. This is almost like cheating: Owning options when we can change the volatility of the underlying is like playing blackjack when we can pick the card that shows up next.
For instance, consider this year's presidential primary race. The reward for being chosen as a party's nominee is immense, while the difference between second place and dead-last is relatively negligible notwithstanding some extra book sales. Indeed, we can understand each candidate as owning an option on their own primary performance, where the candidate receives a huge payout for a first place finish and effectively nothing for anything less. In an unusually crowded Republican field, suggesting that Muslims should be banned from entering America is volatile rhetoric that could potentially relegate a candidate to an indistinguishable mass of failed campaigns, but could just as well galvanize voters and propel him to first place. A safer campaign strategy that guarantees a third or fourth place finish, on the other hand, is in comparison almost worthless.
Closer to home, anyone who’s won a game of Monopoly should intuitively understand that safe strategies are rarely the best strategies. For example, selling someone insurance on landing on your hotel-laden properties, in exchange for fixed cash payments every turn, is likely a terrible deal for all but the most substantial premiums. While you guarantee a steady (and potentially sizable) flow of cash even when no one lands on your property, you do so at a dear cost: by giving up the possibility of an outright win from eliminating a player and accumulating an insurmountable cash lead against the others. The asymmetric payoff of Monopoly (jeers and shame for anything less than first, if you’re playing it right) creates another scenario in which volatile strategies dominate safe but otherwise similar ones.
Of course, it is true that even in winner-take-all competitions, considerations other than winning can arise. For example, it might be considered a loss of face to finish dead-last in a presidential primary race or embarrassing to be the seemingly worst Monopoly player in the room. But if our sole goal is to finish first, we should be extremely careful to distinguish safety from optimality, and take advantage of any chance we have to increase our volatility while holding all else equal.
Seeing the world in terms of options is an extraordinarily powerful viewpoint, and understanding an option as a bet on volatility is just one of many lenses with which we can examine these instruments. While even some financiers have called derivatives weapons of mass destruction, these securities per se are far from destructive: Their existence has led to the creation of fascinating theory, new ways to re-allocate risk, and yet another lens with which to think about the everyday decisions we make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 24, 2016, at 10:15 p.m.
Amid this semester’s mumps outbreak, students living in the Harvard Inn expressed concern last week that they were not immediately informed by the University that mumps patients were being quarantined in the building. The news took at least six days to reach students housed at the Inn, who have otherwise received frequent updates from administrators via email about the growing number of cases.
Christopher M. Gilbert, the acting dean of Dudley House, which now runs the Inn, explained that Harvard uses several of the rooms for “emergency housing” situations, about which students are not necessarily notified. “In order to protect the privacy of our students who need to avail themselves of such housing, the College does not notify residents of the circumstances of who is using such suites and for what reasons,” Gilbert said.
Nevertheless, in this case, the University should have informed residents of the Inn earlier about the new quarantined residents. At its core, this is a matter of common courtesy, and the revelation that the University kept this information from students does not set minds at ease. Withholding these developments also seems to undermine the University’s detailed efforts to provide students with frequent updates on the situation.
It is also true, however, that students should not overreact to the 16 confirmed cases of mumps on campus. While the sickness is indeed contagious, it is primarily spread through salivary contact and not via the air. Thus, should students heed administrators’ advice—such as frequently washing their hands and avoiding shared glasses or utensils—they have little reason to fear. Furthermore, it should be noted that though mumps can result in serious complications, according to the CDC it is typically mild and only deadly "in rare cases."
Despite the need for calm, however, students deserve to know about potential health issues in their living spaces. The slow notification of students at the Harvard Inn resembles how Winthrop House handled its asbestos case earlier this year. As with the current mumps outbreak, the University was clearly prepared to deal with the issue, but administrators should have informed students of the problem sooner even if it was appropriately managed with “third party experts.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 24, 2016
Correction: The original version of this editorial incorrectly stated that the number of confirmed mumps cases is 13. It is now 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These past few weeks, I have been shocked and saddened by the backlash to Currier’s removal of its Housing Day video.  Why has it become controversial to support members of our own community?
In Currier’s video, a student dressed as Donald Trump is looking to buy property at Harvard and ultimately decides that Currier is his favorite place on campus.  Shortly after it was posted, the video was removed in response to some Currier students’ concerns that it makes light of a candidate whose rhetoric deeply disturbs and frightens them.
What worries me even more than the video itself is the response that I have seen to its removal.  Within hours of its being taken off of YouTube, some students had reposted the video to another site and were sharing it alongside messages about how Harvard “coddles” its students and should instead be encouraging them to grow thicker skin.  Even when students were moved to tears at a town hall meeting that evening as they discussed the ways that Trump’s rhetoric personally threatens them, some continued to argue that the video should be posted.  Just yesterday, a Crimson editorial defended the video on the grounds that it is “light-hearted” satire that should not be blown "out of proportion.”
In my view, this response reveals a grave lack of compassion in our community.  When we hear that something we have done has hurt other people and choose not to respond, we belittle their pain.  When we claim that the video was all in jest, that it was anti-Trump anyway so they should toughen up and not worry about it, we act as though their emotions and life experiences are invalid.  Somehow we think we know how they should feel, when in reality we have no idea what it is like to be in their shoes.  For many of us who are not members of communities that Trump has targeted with hateful rhetoric, we cannot know what it feels like to fear violent expressions of Islamophobia or other repercussions of his campaign.  Who are we to say that a Housing Day video satirizing him is not hurtful enough to warrant being taken down?
Ironically, by writing off the concerns of their peers, some students are acting in accordance with the beliefs of the very man they claim the video criticizes.  At the heart of Trump’s presidential campaign is his rejection of “political correctness.”  He distinguishes himself from other politicians through his willingness to make divisive and offensive comments, often targeting specific population groups such as Muslims or Mexican immigrants.  According to Trump, the prospect of hurting someone else should not stop us from saying or doing what we want.  When Harvard students argue that Currier administrators should have left the video online despite the pain that it caused others, they are essentially adopting Trump’s logic.  As long as I find the video hilarious or satirical or harmless, they seem to say, I should feel free to share it.
What this reasoning fails to take into account is the fact that when some members of our community are hurting, the whole body suffers.  In our first days at Harvard, we are repeatedly told that one of the most valuable parts of being here is the people.  We are surrounded by a sea of brilliant and unique peers who can teach us more than we could ever learn inside a classroom.  The residential houses at Harvard are meant to foster these relationships, and the purpose of Housing Day is to welcome freshmen into the house communities.  If we release a divisive Housing Day video that alienates a segment of our community and makes some incoming freshmen uncomfortable, we are acting in opposition to the core purpose of Housing Day.  If we refuse to listen to one another’s concerns and do not make an effort to build cohesive community, we are wasting one of the most precious gifts that Harvard offers us.
Taking other people’s feelings seriously and acting accordingly is not always “coddling” them.  Rather, it is a way of supporting them as they walk through all of the hate and messiness that life throws their way.  We are fortunate to live with an incredibly diverse group of peers, but if we don’t work to ensure that everyone feels like a valued member of this community, we are wasting an opportunity we’ve been given.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this point, it has been well established that sexual assault on college campuses is an important issue. And practically everyone agrees that rape is bad. You’d be hard-pressed to find people who openly declare support for rapists, or say that rape is okay.
And yet, progress for campus sexual assault survivors is repeatedly stymied. The system for rape reporting continues to fail survivors. Between improperly processed rape kits and inadequate counseling services, sexual assault survivors on college campuses are routinely confronted with a system that seems to be working against them, rather than for them. Who is upholding this broken system, and protecting sexual assault perpetrators at the expense of survivors?
Rape apologists are. The problem is, they don’t consider themselves defenders of rapists. Instead, they call themselves defenders of liberty and due process before the law. They are the self-proclaimed champions of “innocent before proven guilty.” All they want is fairness and equality—that is, for the men who are accused of rape.
Rape apologists are the people who try to pass bills like the Safe Campus Act, which aims to protect the rights of the falsely-accused by prohibiting colleges from investigating sexual assault cases until the survivor reports the crime to police. Rape apologists are the people who confer pity and sympathy onto the men who are accused of sexual assault, bemoaning how they had such “promising futures” and calling their victims career-destroyers.
And rape apologists are the people who accuse women of “crying rape” to get attention or exact revenge against someone. As one men’s rights activist explains: “Sex is rape when the woman tells authorities it is rape, even if she never mentions it to the person she’s accusing of rape. If I make a pass at a woman, and for whatever reason she goes along with it, wakes up feeling bad about it, and goes to the police, I go to prison.”
While false rape accusations do certainly occur, they are vastly outnumbered by the number of actual rapes that go unreported. Rape is one of the most underreported crimes. Out of every 100 rapes, only 32 get reported to the police, only seven lead to an arrest, only three are referred to prosecutors, only two lead to a felony conviction, and only two rapists will spend even a single day in prison.
It is far more likely for a woman to not report a rape that actually happened than to lie about a rape that never happened, simply because it is extremely difficult to come out as a sexual assault survivor. As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult for women to even admit to themselves that what happened to them was sexual assault.
That’s because we live in a world where heterosexual women have been socialized to expect sexual encounters that involve a heavily gendered script where the man is aggressive and persistent, and the woman is reluctant and unwilling. From catchy pop songs like Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” telling women “you know you want it” because of the “blurred lines” of consent to heartwarming classic holiday songs like “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” that describes a man who relentlessly asks a woman to stay at his house despite her protests, the normalization of sexual assault and violation of women’s consent has been hammered into our collective consciousness.
As a result, women are often reluctant to use the language of sexual assault to describe sexual encounters in which their consent was disregarded or violated. When my female friends tell me about how they told someone they didn’t want to have sex but he went ahead anyway, they shrug it off as something that “just happens” because “boys will be boys.” And when these things happen to me, I shrug it off, too. We feel uncomfortable with what happened to us, but it seems too extreme, too stigmatizing, to say out loud that we have experienced sexual assault.
There are serious repercussions to coming out as a sexual assault survivor. While our society tends to respect and believe what men have to say, it constantly doubts and disbelieves what women say. When a woman says that she was sexually assaulted, our first reaction is not to believe her. Instead, we victim-blame her. We ask her how much makeup she was wearing, or how scanty her clothing was. We wonder if what happened to her was really “serious” enough to count as “rape.” And then we accuse her of crying rape to get attention or sympathy, or to get revenge on the man if the sex wasn’t good enough or if he broke her heart.
And as a result, survivors routinely fail to report their experiences as rape. A study showed that 50 percent of survivors did not report because they felt responsible for what happened, and 29 percent did not report because they did not want anyone to know and feared the backlash they would receive.
A society that does not take women seriously when they say they’ve been sexually assaulted is the same society that socializes men to not take women seriously when they say “no.” Women expect men to not respect them when they say “no.” We instead come up with different, more palatable ways to say “no” to men. We lie about having a boyfriend, we pretend we need to go to the bathroom, we devise innovative ways to say “no” without actually saying it because we know that when we say “no” it’s not the end of the discussion, but rather the beginning of a long and wearisome negotiation.
Therefore, the focus on false rape accusations is not only misguided, it is deeply harmful. When we spend so much time talking about these rare occurrences, we make it harder for actual survivors to muster the courage to report their rapes. We contribute to a structure that doesn’t take survivors seriously when they do report their rapes.
This only exacerbates the underreporting of sexual assaults that actually do happen, and this only further perpetuates and normalizes the silencing of women. And until we show that we as a society will listen to women when they say they’ve been sexually assaulted, we will continue to teach them that their voices, and their “no’s,” go unheard.

On a mild Sunday afternoon in Allston’s Smith Field park, two empty hammocks swing from a small stand of trees. Unopened bottles of Pabst Blue Ribbon line metal benches. Upturned grocery carts serve as makeshift goals in the nearby hockey court.
At first, only two men in their late twenties chat softly in the park, nursing beers as they stand by the hammocks. Slowly, more begin to arrive, bringing lime-flavored sports drinks, roommates, girlfriends, hard liquor shots, and bikes. Everyone has a bike. Some arrive riding one.
These are the members of the Boston Bike Polo club (slogan: “Slapping Balls Since 2006”). They have come to play hardcourt bike polo.
“It’s not for the faint-hearted,” one member, Conner Williams, says of the sport. Williams, who hails from Melbourne, Australia, is a fairly recent convert—he discovered hardcourt bike polo just three years ago. Some BBP members have been playing the game for nearly a decade.
Bike polo, traditional polo played on bikes, has existed for over a century. Hardcourt bike polo, the sport played on a hard surface, has only been around since 1999, when, according to the North American Hardcourt website, a band of Seattle bike messengers invented the sport to entertain themselves between jobs.
“It was a group of really gnarly dudes who lived on their bikes,” says self-described “bike nerd” and BBP member Addison Minott. “That’s what the sport evolved out of.”
Since then, hardcourt bike polo has spread across the nation and the globe. People in more than 30 different countries and 300 cities play the sport, and BBP’s Tobi Howell estimates that there are currently between 10,000 and 15,000 active hardcourt bike polo players worldwide. Williams, for his part, says the number is “uncountable,” citing would-be players’ high dropout rate due to the dangerous nature of the sport.
“The first time I played polo, I nearly lost both fingers on this hand,” Williams says, extending his arm and waggling the salvaged appendages. He admits this brush with serious injury was partly his own fault—he had had “too much to drink” prior to mounting his bike. 
Undeterred by Williams’s tale, the BBP members continue to sip beers. In between swallows, the men ready the hockey court, removing the shopping carts and replacing them with small, metal goals painted orange. Eventually, four bikers spill lazily onto the court, mallets in hand, and begin a haphazard game.
Hardcourt bike polo is usually played three per team, but this is only a warm-up match, Howell explains. Playing two-on-two is “a lot more open and quicker,” he adds, though this game seems to be moving slowly.
The bikers sail around the court with confidence and ease, hitting the ball back and forth and taking the occasional shot at goal. Often, the players use the sides of the hockey court as a third man, knocking the ball against the wall to pass it to themselves or a teammate. One competitor glides past, a lit cigarette dangling from his lips, before stationing his bike in front of the goal to block an opponent’s shot from half-court.
The rules of hardcourt bike polo are similar to those of hockey, with one key difference: Bikers are not allowed to let their feet touch the ground. Thus, the men of BBP have become adept at sitting motionless on their bikes, a balancing act known as “track standing.”
“If you’re riding down the street on your bike, you’ll see people at stoplights try to balance,” Minott notes. “If any of us are at a stoplight we can just sit on our bikes all day long.”
Watching the players—who can stop, hop, and turn their bikes in one fluid movement—I find it easy to believe him. Many members have had years to practice; the group, which meets twice weekly and holds two large-scale tournaments a year, was founded in 2006 and moved to Smith Field in 2007.
“It’s in the armpit of Boston, as I like to call it,” Minott says of the hockey court’s location. “[But] this is our home, and we do whatever we can to take care of it.” BBP members regularly clean the park, clear litter from the area, and perform “unsanctioned repairs” on the hockey court’s boards, according to Minott. “We do it because no one else does,” he says.
The bikers have left their mark on Allston’s hockey court in more ways than simple fixes: Stickers displaying the logos of bike polo clubs from around the world adorn the metal posts that line the court. The stickers come both from players passing through for BBP’s biannual tournaments and from club regulars.
Howell points to a red-and-white sticker bearing the words “Good Owl’ Boys.” This, he says, was the name of his three-person team—made up of Howell, a biker from Seattle, and a biker from Geneva—that traveled to New Zealand last month for the World Hardcourt Bike Polo Championships. The group ended up placing in the top 16.
Howell is not the only BBP member to have competed on the international stage—fellow biker Javier Garcia-Albea previously traveled to France to play in the 2014 world championships. Despite the club’s success on the global level, members cite the local community as the primary reason for their continued participation.
“I think it’s the perfect combination of social and competitive sport,” Minott says. “It’s at your leisure: Come, hang out, have fun, drink a beer, and then get on the court and take out some anger from the work week.” Howell agrees, commenting that BBP is “like a tribe.”
Sujata Mulekar, girlfriend of biker Jacques Chouinard, notes the BBP community extends to members’ significant others. “We all hang out,” she says. “One of the players, Allen, had his birthday [a few days ago], so we were all at his house that night.”
Mulekar herself once tried hardcourt bike polo, but the attempt was short-lived because of her busy schedule as a medical school student. In general, BBP consists of mostly males, though one female competitor, Charlotte Fagan, plays regularly.
After pausing a moment, Mulekar looks down at her shirt, a grey tank top imprinted with the BBP logo that Minott designed. Stretching the fabric to better display the graphic—in which a blue-and-yellow version of the Boston Celtics’ mascot wields a polo mallet and ball—she smiles.
“This was my birthday present,” she says.

Those in search of identity politics last Wednesday would have been well served by closing their critical theory books and heading to Newbury St. for a ride with the elite spin franchise SoulCycle. The Back Bay studio had a special theme that night: “Hamilton,” the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical that rewrites American history in hip-hop lyrics and recasts people of color in the lily-white roles of the founding fathers.
8:30 p.m. SoulCycle revealed somewhat different demographics. A quick statistical room scan netted 50 people and five people of color—jarring, but oddly similar to what one would find in a well-heeled “Hamilton” audience. Next came the qualitative data: “Will she go in order?” someone asked of the instructor’s playlist. “What do you think the first song will be?” pondered another. “I love Uber!” exclaimed a third upon arriving. “Gosh, I spend too much money here.”
True, but in comparison to “Hamilton” ticket prices, the SoulCycle session was almost affordable. Only 20 riders, it turned out, had seen the show. So the bouncy blonde instructor offered a 20-second synopsis as the bikes’ pedals started to move: “This is a story about struggle,” she yelled. “Alexander Hamilton came from nothing. Okay, let’s do this.”
One had to wonder, of course, just how much POC-“Hamilton”-struggle was really going on in this room. And as the song “Helpless” cued, the messy knot of racial, socioeconomic, and gender politics only continued to tighten.
The knot was the result of a human psychological feature oft exploited by intense exercise regimes: We easily map language onto our own experiences, regardless of how divorced a word’s original context is from those experiences. When married with music and sweat and endorphins, this mapping becomes evocative, then epiphanic. We internalize Kanye West’s “Monster” to refer to insecurities at work and to the battle with the next bicep curl. Even those attuned to identity politics tend not to care much about the nature of these transpositions. When we dance—on a bike or a table—we fluidly adopt what we might normally dissect.
“Hamilton” SoulCycle, though, demanded scrutiny. Some sing-along references were comic, others disquieting. “I’m a trust fund baby. You can trust me” felt more applicable than “Immigrants, we get the job done.” The class climaxed with instructor & co. pedalling in time and Hamilton & co. “running out of time” to compose the federalist papers. Miranda’s only white character—a dandyish King of England played by Jonathan Groff—failed to earn a song slot until the ending stretch.
Still, there were more agreeable moments. Though it remains caught in the trappings of patriarchy, Miranda’s show makes lauded attempts to rewrite early American history under more feminist principles. So it was gratifying to hear a mostly female room echo a character’s insistence that Jefferson revise “All men are created equal” to include women. For a moment, the room’s ideological knot loosened.
Then the riders belted “History is happening,” and it constricted once more. “In Manhattan,” they added, and it was noose-tight. “We just happen to be in the greatest city in the world,” followed, and this urbanite couldn’t help but cringe.
But that had nothing to do with identity politics.

UPDATED: March 24, 2016, at 11:39 a.m.
Kitty Zen carries a purse with one of her original paintings printed on it. It’s an explosive cosmic design, vivid swirls of color punctuated with white stars. She calls the work Nebula. Like her other pieces, and even her pale silver hair, it has an almost ethereal quality.

“It seems so unreal every time I pick it up,” she says. “I’m surprised to see it.”
A SERIOUS AUDIENCE
Zen is one of almost 70 artists associated with ArtLifting, an online gallery that sells work by homeless and disabled individuals. Founded in 2013 by Liz J. Powers ’10 and her brother, ArtLifting now recruits talented artists from art therapy programs in homeless shelters and disability centers across the United States. The organization not only sells the artists’ original work, but also turns their pieces into licensed products such as phone cases, tote bags, and prints.

Zen is a PTSD survivor who became involved with ArtLifting when she was staying in the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. Last spring, her paintings were featured in a show at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She was also commissioned to create a mural that currently hangs in the Y2Y Homeless Shelter, where she works as a Youth Advocacy Coordinator.
“[I used to have] a lot of trouble with getting my art out there because of the stigma attached to being homeless,” Zen explains. But in the two years that she has been with ArtLifting, Zen has been treated as a professional artist and gained access to “a serious audience” that she had not previously been able to reach.
A YEAR-ROUND MARKETPLACE
Powers has 15 minutes for an interview.
“Sorry if I’m out of breath,” she tells us on the phone. “I am power-walking to a meeting while talking.”
Powers’s packed schedule makes sense, given her organization’s rapid growth: In the two years since she founded it, ArtLifting has expanded to 10 cities including Chicago, Austin, and Washington, D.C.

After graduating from Harvard with a degree in Sociology, Powers set out to continue the work she had started as a case worker for homeless individuals. A lifelong artist herself, she hoped to create art therapy groups to combat the loneliness that many of her homeless clients had experienced. After receiving PBHA’s STRIDE fellowship to carry out this project, Powers discovered six existing art groups in Boston shelters and decided to shift her focus.
“I kept hearing from art therapists that [people in their programs were] really creating so much art every day and a lot of it is really [sellable], but it just ended up in the closets or basements,” Powers recalls.
Seeing no reason that the work should go to waste, Powers organized a city-wide art show spotlighting artists from eight local shelters and disability centers. Its overwhelming success over several years led Powers to found ArtLifting, which she describes as “a year-round marketplace” for homeless and disabled artists.
UP AND UP
Given ArtLifting’s goals, one might assume that the organization is a non-profit, but the company’s for-profit status complements its social mission. 


“We’re really proud to be a for-profit social enterprise,” Powers says.
Artists who sell work on ArtLifting receive 55 percent of the profit, with prices ranging from $100 for prints to $2,500 for original pieces. According to Powers, this business model resembles those of most art galleries.
This standard gallery structure suits the artists as much as it does the organization. “ArtLifting doesn’t treat me any differently than any other gallerist would,” Allen Chamberland, one of the organization’s first artists, says. “It makes me feel better because I know people aren’t buying it just because they figure they’re helping.”
Chamberland, who was diagnosed with Swyer James Syndrome as a child, has sold more than 50 pieces through ArtLifting. The income he’s earned from his paper cuts—images cut from a single sheet of black paper—has enabled him to pursue “more ambitious, more challenging” work than he previously could.
But for Chamberland, the sales are about more than just the money.
“[Selling my work] was just a validation,” Chamberland says. “People do like what I do. People are interested in what I do.”
Chamberland’s experience closely aligns with the organization’s mission. “We measure our impact in two ways,” Powers explains. “One is on the money end; the other is through confidence built.”
Powers believes that the income and affirmation from selling work motivates artists to improve their situations.
“All of a sudden, artists have energy to get a side job or to do housing applications or do other things to better their lives,” she says. Five artists have gained housing since joining ArtLifting.
ArtLifting’s “domino effect” that Powers describes seems to ring true for the artists. As Chamberland explains, since he joined ArtLifting, “It’s just been this ride up and up and up and up.”

I left, I left, I left my wife in New Orleans
With fifty kids and a can of beans
I thought it was right, right…
Libby and I walked arm in arm, swinging our feet over each other’s legs, shouting this schoolyard chant at the top of our lungs. We met at age three and, throughout our elementary school careers, we were the stars of every playground, giggling in our matching seersucker sundresses and blonde pigtails.

We trotted through childhood in this fashion; trick-or-treating in homemade costumes down her picturesque neighborhood street; winning snowball fights in frosty pathways around her grandparents’ Idaho ranch; parading through our local market, selling Girl Scout cookies to passersby; holding milkshakes; twirling near a warm beach bonfire.
Almost immediately, our families became intertwined. I gained a second set of parents and the little brothers I never had. I attended Sunday church after Saturday night sleepovers and, later, Libby tirelessly ran through Bat Mitzvah prayers and procedures with me. We sought out shopkeepers and restaurant workers alike to see if they would believe we were sisters.
When we were 12 years old, Libby and I enrolled in different middle schools. Her daily presence was replaced by that of girls who gossiped, shopped in the pre-teen section of Bloomingdales, and had a predilection for three-way calling pranks. The click-clacking of high heels overpowered the slapping of white Adidas.
We could no longer share our lunches or have our midday chats, and going to each other’s houses after school quickly became impractical. Playground trots turned into daily phone calls. We often called each other crying, wanting to return to our old lives. We didn’t want to progress, only rewind. But despite the distance, we somehow managed to maintain our friendship. We had to figure out how to stay close because neither of us could remember or imagine life without the other one in it.
Our lives diverged. Libby’s wanderlust took her to exotic locales for summers—eventually to Amman, Jordan for our junior year of high school. Meanwhile, I grew close with a caring group of friends and immersed myself in APs and standardized tests. Our calls turned to texts and, one year, she celebrated her birthday and Halloween away from home and me. Our reunions were joyous but short-lived.

When we began college in August, the space between us grew again. The journey from her room to mine is measured in miles, not minutes. Fortunately, we now are much better suited to handle the distance.
A couple of weeks ago, I was home coping with the recent death of my grandfather. My birthday fell a few days later and Libby’s mother showed up at the front door she had entered so many times, with a note and cupcakes from her daughter in Washington, D.C. Libby was looking out for me and after me, even from 3,000 miles away.
The gesture made me realize that we had seamlessly outgrown the interlocked arms and skipping feet that were the original landmarks of our friendship. While we are now not as physically close as we once were, our friendship no longer needs that proximity.
Time marches on, and we are still marching in tandem.

“All this has happened before, and all this will happen again,” I think, spraying the mirror before me with a liberal dose of Enzysan, wiping it down with the green—sorry, blue—cloth, already damp from the shower fixtures. “And again,” I remind myself as I move on to the sink, switching to the green—definitely supposed to be green—microfiber that gives a final sheen to the porcelain, scooping up any hair or toothpaste particles that might have evaded the sponge on the first pass. “And again,” I chant, the yellow cloth now in hand, going over each curve and crevice of the toilet. “And again.” I write my initials on the sticky note—J. P. F. a semi-legible scribble at best. “Questions? Compliments? Complaints?” I leave the note on the sink, where it will likely linger for the next two weeks until I or someone else replaces it with another. Two bathrooms behind me, two more to go.

I repeat this ritual week in and week out, as I have for the past three-and-a-half years since I started working for Dorm Crew as a freshman at Fall Clean-Up. Some things change—the number of bathrooms I choose to clean (usually four), the chemicals I use (farewell, noble Oxivir), my exact title (you may address me as House Captain)—but most things, the important things, stay the same. I can count on there being three things: a toilet, a sink, and a shower. I always clean them the same way, using the same techniques taught to me as a freshman that I now pass on to new freshmen. Start from the outside and work your way in, scrub with vigor, don’t be afraid to spray, and watch out when you’re turning on the bath (you can never tell when you’ll be showered from up above). While some differences may arise, the underlying core of cleaning a bathroom remains untouched, steadfast, a dogma I can always fall back upon when confronted by a particularly disheartening toilet.
In some ways, that dogma gives me comfort. It provides me direction where I might otherwise stand listlessly, broom pushing a pile of toilet paper scraps across the floor, back and forth forever. But like any ritual, it loses some of the meaning you once thought it held after you perform it a few hundred times. Dorm Crew’s unofficial slogan is “Fight Entropy!” but now only a faded and water stained piece of paper displays that phrase, threatening to fall off the door someone stuck it to so long ago. I go to the bathrooms week in and week out, but nothing ever changes. However beautiful the sink was when I last left it, it returns to crumbling decadence, the porcelain gleam covered by mounds of soap residue and dried saliva. And don’t get me started on the toilet.
Over time, I start to wonder: why bother to spray Enzysan on the shower curtain? Does it really do anything to fight mold? I’ve never seen it do anything, never verified the results. How can I really tell? But I do it, like I do so many other things, because people told me to and because I trusted them. And slowly but surely, the amount of chemicals in my spray bottle decreases, the sponges wear out, even the bristles on my grout brush blunt as gunk surrounds and stifles them. I order new ones and refill the bottles, but even this is only a temporary solution. Soon I will have to order even more, repeat the same steps, over and over, again and again, until I myself am replaced by the same freshmen that I trained to follow after me.
I know this, and I still work, week in and week out, bathroom after bathroom. I clean not because I expect to discover any profound revelations—after all, this job is literally full of shit—but because it pays well. I need to finance myself somehow, after all.
Of course, other jobs exist out there. Perhaps even better paying ones that I could seek out. Yet something draws me back to the bathrooms. Maybe it’s the opportunity to get a rare glimpse into the lives of other people, the vast majority of whom I will never have more than a fleeting conversation with in the dining hall. A bathroom reveals something about the people who live in it: the products they use, the party they had last night, how comfortable they are living in absolute filth. While I know that in a week all my hard work will be erased, leaving that sticky note on the sink reminds me of the importance of the small things, that even insignificant actions can make a difference in our daily routine, that I affect the people around me in so many tiny and hidden ways.  So even if I don’t quite understand every aspect of the ritual, even if I’m not convinced that Enzysan fights mold, I spray the shower curtain.

Shortly after this year’s Academy Awards, New York Times film critic A.O. Scott ’87-’88 visited Harvard Square to promote his new book, “Better Living Through Criticism.” The book, Scott’s first, addresses the role of critics and criticism in the process of creating art. Before presenting at the Harvard Book Store, Scott chatted with FM about topics ranging from his book and Rotten Tomatoes to #OscarsSoWhite and “Freddy got Fingered.”
FM: In your book, you argue that criticism is imperative to the creative process. What exactly do you mean by this?
S: First of all, the perspective that art takes on the world is inherently a critical one, one that is looking for value, one that is interpreting. I think it’s also true that most art is engaged explicitly or implicitly with other art; that is, artists are inspired by or are trying to imitate, or correct, or improve upon, or understand the work that surrounds them. So criticism is really built into a great deal of what artists do, even at the level of technique, but also at the level of thinking.
FM: Do you think the creation of art is then filtered through this criticism process?
S: I think it is. You know, when you listen to the Rolling Stones, and you hear Muddy Waters, or when you look at a Tarantino movie and you see what he’s doing with Blaxploitation films, what you’re watching is a work of criticism.
FM: Do you think that your criticism as a New York Times film critic impacts the field?
S: I have no idea.
FM: That’s fair.
S: In a way, it’s not for me to say. It’s not quite my intention. It’s certainly true that people who are involved in film do read the works of critics, but I’m not sure there’s a direct influence. And I don’t think that it’s necessarily the role of the critic to prescribe what artists do. It’s more the work of critics to try to do some work on behalf of the audience in evaluating and understanding artists’ work.
FM: In a similar vein, the phrase “everyone’s a critic” seems especially relevant today, because everyone has an outlet to express their opinions, be it via blogs or through Twitter. How do you view this change in the media landscape?
S: I think it’s a change in the media platforms that are available for people to express and exchange their opinions. I’m actually not sure it’s a huge change in what criticism is and how it works. I think people have always been reacting to what they see, arguing about it, developing their opinions with more or less rigor or discipline. I think what has changed is that now there is a medium available for the exchange to happen in public and across a much wider, larger public than before.
FM: I would imagine that people today have shortened attention spans, as flashy headlines and sound bites will drive more clicks and reads than long, in-depth articles. Do you think this has affected your role as a critic?
S: I don’t know. The attention span is a mysterious thing. On the one hand, it’s often said that people have short or fragmented attention spans. On the other hand, people will binge watch like 17 hours of a TV show in one weekend. The reviews that are published in The New York Times are substantially longer than they were 30 or 40 years ago.  The major reviews of the major movies tend to be 900 or a 1,000 words and that’s partly because our readership seems to want a little more depth and a little more thought. It’s something other than a kind of easy snap judgment or a numerical value that you get on an aggregation site like Rotten Tomatoes.
FM: How do you view sites like Rotten Tomatoes as vehicles for criticism?
S: Rotten Tomatoes is interesting because it aggregates reviews, so it doesn’t present any kind of argument. There’s nothing in the Rotten Tomatoes raw score, or even the little quotes that they use on the site, that would really persuade you to see a movie or not. It’s just sort of an index of opinion. It’s like a poll. And that can be useful if you want to check in and say, “Oh okay, all of these critics and art people, they mostly liked it.”  Whether or not that means you too will like it is another question. I think you can get a better sense of whether or not you think you’re going to like something if you read the work of a critic that you know and trust and tend to understand.
FM: Is there a universally panned movie that you have enjoyed more than other critics?
S: The most famous one in my career goes back some years to “Freddy Got Fingered,” which is one of the most reviled and hated movies that I can think of. I said it was a challenging and innovative work of art. It’s a movie directed by and starring Tom Green, who is still around but was a pretty popular MTV host in the late 90s and early 2000’s.  He shows up in an Eminem song “The Real Slim Shady,” where it talks about him humping a dead moose on MTV. He made this movie that is fairly extreme, even by current standards of gross humor, but I thought it was conceptually and formally brilliant. So I wrote a fairly notorious rave of it, but every other review was like an F and a one star. There were critics who were claiming to have walked out because they couldn’t stand watching it. So there I was, fairly new at The New York Times, and I did have a moment of, “Oh my gosh, I’m going to get fired.” But nope.
FM: Has that film gained a cult following since it was released?
S: It has, and I believe I had something to do with it. A couple of years after the movie, people would make fun of the fact that I liked it. Now, every once in awhile, someone will come up on Twitter and pat me on the back, so the status of that review has slipped over time. It’s now not so much mocked, but held up as one of my better efforts.
FM: On the flipside, are there any universally praised movies that you very much disliked?
S: Yeah, I was not a big fan of “The Theory of Everything” or of Eddie Redmayne’s performance in it.  I remember fairly early on, I panned “Wonder Boys,” and I panned “Erin Brockovich.” I stand by those. I had a lot of problems with “Son of Saul,” which recently won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and I wrote up a pretty hard criticism of it. When you pan movies like that, you get a lot of pushback, because those movies are extravagantly praised and represent a sort of seriousness of purpose and artistic ambition. People really don’t like it when critics come out against them.
FM: Right, I remember seeing Samuel L. Jackson tweet about your review for “The Avengers,” which he was not so happy about.
S: It was a valuable moment in a way, because it helped encourage me in the writing of this book. Usually with movie stars, you kind of leave them alone and don’t want to fight, but he did say that Avengers fans should go help find me a new job, one that I could actually do. And that kind of got me thinking about what a job is, how you actually do it, and that did accelerate the writing of this book.
FM: As a film critic, how would you say your role expands to criticism of the film industry?
S: Well, I think it’s important. I think it’s very important to understand where movies come from: who makes them, how they’re made.  Every movie, however small, represents a rather large and complicated commercial enterprise in a way that a book doesn’t. You are confronted with the facts and artifacts of capitalism every time you are writing about a movie, and you cannot make that the whole subject of your criticism or the whole burden of every review, but you need to be aware of it, and sometimes you need to remind your viewers of it.
FM: What then do you think is the biggest issue in the film industry right now that should be addressed?
S: I think in the American film industry, there is no question that it is increasing diversity.  #OscarsSoWhite was pointing out a very particular manifestation of a very broad, systemic problem, and I think the really shocking, dramatic exclusion of women and people of color from all aspects of the industry is the thing that the industry is going to have to deal with. That’s the big one, and I think some of us have been trying to call attention to that for a while. It’s definitely not going to end because the Oscars are over and Chris Rock made everyone laugh about it.

“This is not my favorite tour,” Thomas M. Lauderdale ’92 says, exhaling a lungful of smoke and bringing his cigarette to his mouth for another drag.
Pink Martini has been on the road for about a week, though Lauderdale says it feels like a month. His mood is a little surprising. Lauderdale’s name has been synonymous with eccentric energy for practically his whole life. A Crimson profile written by Michael R. Grunwald ’92 in Lauderdale’s senior year describes him “working the mid-afternoon crowd” on Mt. Auburn Street “like a town mayor on acid.”  Today, though, the mayor looks beat.
Lauderdale’s band, Pink Martini, defies succinct definition. Lauderdale describes its genre with characteristically high amounts of whimsy and frustratingly low amounts of actual information. It’s like “‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ meets the United Nations from 1962,” he says.
The band’s lead singer, China Forbes ’92, also gives it a shot (“old-fashioned pop,” or maybe “sky’s-the-limit orchestral pop”) but ultimately gives up. “There really is no way to describe it in a few words.”
A quick glance at Pink Martini’s discography tells you why the self-styled “little orchestra” is so hard to pin down. Their 2007 album, “Hey Eugene!,” for instance, features songs in French, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, and English. The titular track is a song about an intoxicated nightclub encounter with a man named Eugene who doesn’t call the singer afterwards.
Whatever you want to call them, though, Pink Martini has staying power.  The duo met as undergrads in Adams House, when Lauderdale used to provide piano accompaniment for Forbes as she sang late-night Puccini and Verdi in the Adams Lower Common Room. A few years after their graduation, Lauderdale invited Forbes to start singing with his new group, Pink Martini. Nine albums and more than two decades later, they’re still performing together.
Forbes was a powerhouse in the arts community, winning the Jonathan Levy award her senior year and once convincing an undecided prefrosh to choose Harvard over Yale through the sheer allure of her voice. (“I had such a huge crush on her that I wanted to come,” said the prefrosh in question, Alexis Toomer ’93, the year she graduated.)
Lauderdale was a party boy. As Adams House’s HoCo co-chair, he threw his fair share of “mad dance parties,” and says he almost got expelled for hosting a “Truth or Dare” party (held in honor of Madonna’s album of the same name) in which he served alcohol to minors in the Adams Upper Common Room. He is also allegedly responsible for the closing of the Adams House Pool (now the Pool House Theater) after his raucous  party, “Bungle in the Jungle,” became a clothing-optional bathhouse bacchanale. Forbes, though an Adams House resident, never actually went to the pool, saying she “just wasn’t into orgies.” In his profile, Grunwald called Lauderdale “the official cruise director for the class of ’92.”
Forbes sings a vocal warm-up that seems to consist of repeating the word “Ohio” with varying amounts of volume and vibrato. Then, there’s some tense confusion between Forbes and the crew over the levels of someone’s microphone that went way over my head. Finally, she makes her way down to my photographer Rebecca and me.
Charming and eloquent, Forbes approaches the interview with the polish of someone who’s done this before. She tells me the secret to singing in so many languages (“[I] pretend I’m a little bit tipsy and then I just blur everything together”), the feel of Portland in the mid-’90s when she joined Pink Martini (“summer camp,”) and some of her musical inspirations (Ella Fitzgerald, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, etc.). She compares Pink Martini’s evolving sound to a recipe: “I don’t know what kind of cookie we’re baking, but it’s got way too many ingredients.”
Lauderdale, by contrast, seems to have completely forgotten what an interview is. Clearly exhausted, he answers a question about his life post-Harvard with a meandering discussion of Andy Warhol’s magazine “Interview,” and how writing changes when you use a computer rather than a pad of paper, like the one he used for his senior thesis.
He quickly puts out his cigarette as we walk into the lobby of the Boston Sheraton. These days, Lauderdale says, he’s particularly worried by the negativity and movement away from honest communication brought on by technology and reality television. On a TV behind him, CNN is running a segment on GOP opposition to Trump’s presidential bid.  At various points, he asks me and Rebecca how we conduct our arguments and what our assessment of our generation is.
It’s not too surprising that politics is on his mind. He worked in city hall throughout high school and college, and  his goal on graduation was to become the Mayor of Portland—though the closest he’s come so far is a 1986 stint as Junior Mayor. He’s stayed active in progressive politics and was invited by Congressman Earl Blumenauer to the State of the Union Address in 2013, where he was seated next to conservative rockstar Ted Nugent. There are also politics within the band, according to Lauderdale. Recently, Lauderdale hired an independent mediator to meet with every musician and staff member of Pink Martini in an attempt to address any concerns people don’t want to bring up with him.
After learning that Rebecca is a fan, Lauderdale perks up a bit, drawing her into a selfie that he insists they retake (“I look like hell”), getting us backstage passes so that she can photograph him and Forbes before the show, and even suggesting she sit next to him at the piano to take pictures. Finally, he asks us what time the show is, looks at his watch, and excuses himself to get dressed.
Getting the photo of Forbes and Lauderdale together before the show starts proves stressful. Forbes seems to be in the midst of pre-show preparations when Lauderdale brings her out, and it’s only when you see them standing next to each other that you realize what an odd couple they are. Forbes, tall, elegant, strikingly beautiful; and Lauderdale, short, platinum-haired and somewhat impish. Lauderdale wants one of them walking up the stairs to the stage. Forbes seems to want the whole business done with as quickly as possible.
 
Rebecca and I make our way out the stage door and to the front to find our seats, nosebleeds a mile away from the stage. Even from that far back, though, the effect is magical. During the opening number, Lauderdale’s hands grasshopper jauntily across the piano and Forbes’s voice is pure velvet as she moves her shoulders in a way that is both classic and utterly beguiling. The magic isn’t that they’re good. Pick any Pink Martini review you can find, and chances are it’s gushingly positive. The magic is the transformation. In front of a crowd, the angst and grind of the tour and soundcheck are replaced with a smooth, crowd-pleasing performance. It’s alchemy, turning lead into gold.
Lauderdale’s patter is near-flawless, describing one song as “I Will Survive” meets “Hit the Road Jack” meets Franz Schubert, all in 1950s Havana.  At the end of the night, the crowd calls the band back for an encore and dances in the aisles as they strike up again.
After assuring the audience that the love is mutual, Pink Martini exits backstage. Four hours later, at 2a.m., they’ll meet in front of the hotel, board the bus, and head to the next tour stop.

“Masada is no longer a symbol of Israel,” Amir, our tour guide, began.
The famed story of the fortress Masada, whose inhabitants committed mass suicide instead of surrendering to Roman rule, has lived on for almost a full 2,000 years. Masada had long been an emblem of Israeli pride, Amir explained, but its story no longer matches the ideals of an open and democratic Israeli state. Israeli identity has evolved, he said, through constant self-reflection.
On our last night in Israel, we headed out to a Tel Aviv suburb and joined a crowd of mostly 60-year-olds at a concert performed by the “Rolling Stones of Israel.” Before long, I found myself breaking into a dancing spree and making hand gestures toward the main vocalist, who seemed amused by the random American college kids acting like they were at a dorm party.
In the weekly Fareed Zakaria podcasts I listened to or the occasional “Atlantic” article I read before leaving for the trip, Israel seemed to be all about conflict: A against B, this problem and that fight. So that’s what I expected as I boarded my Turkish Airlines flight to Tel Aviv. I wanted to get a first-hand look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, so that I could develop rational, independent views on the issue by the end of the trip.
Upon setting foot in Jerusalem, I soon realized that the eight days we had would be far too short for me to complete that mission. I was fascinated by what I learned about Israel’s peace negotiations and multiparty parliamentary democracy, but the daily wonders of the streets—men dressed in all sorts of attire, Hebrew, Arabic, and English coexisting on street signs, and Israeli soldiers patrolling the bustling markets—were just as interesting.
The occasional UN vehicles I noticed in the hotel parking lot, and the warnings about walking in the area of the Old City between the Muslim market and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, reminded me of the conflict that the media never fails to spotlight. Israelis like the man I met selling freshly squeezed pomegranate juice at a market in Jerusalem, though, didn’t always seem to have the conflict on the top of their minds.
I’m from South Korea, and so, I, too, am used to getting questions about how worried I am about this nuclear test or that missile launch from my unfriendly neighbor to the north. It’s sad that Kim Jong-un, not some famous poet or a world-class chef, is the most famous Korean to most of my classmates. “There’s more!” I always want to tell them.
In Israel, I dipped my feet in the clear waters of the Sea of Galilee and picked up chunky salt crystals in the Dead Sea. I danced the Debka with children in Nazareth. I sang the Shabbat prayers one Friday night. In a few years’ time, I will remember both the camel walls of the Old City and the reflection of the beach on the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv. Most importantly, I will remember the mysterious mélange of stories this land has to share.

Located at the Brookline Village stop on the Green Line, past Copley and Hynes, sits the Puppet Showplace Theater. Though its bubble-lettered signage may appear childish, Puppet Showplace is a home for the entire (adult) Boston puppetry community. Yes, you read that right. There is a robust puppetry community in Boston, and the people behind Puppet Showplace offer them a place to perform their art.
I make the trip to Brookline on a gloomy Thursday. As I stand inside the lobby of the theater, a space whose walls are lined with different types of puppets for sale, I remind myself to look and not touch, an instinct that, as I’ll learn shortly, children here do not share. A few minutes later, several first-graders pile into the space, reach for the puppets, and ask to play with them. The answer is a resounding yes, but followed by, “Be very careful with the marionettes.” Artistic Director Roxie Myhrum ’05 pops into the lobby from behind a curtain and invites us into the theater. Once inside, she consults the elementary school children on how they think an audience should behave.
Colorful sculptures wrap around the walls and hang from the ceiling. The kids and their chaperones are causing mayhem at a mini-puppet theater photo booth. Posters and fliers around the lobby invite patrons to puppetry classes of all kinds. Adults are welcomed to Cabaret Puppetry and marionette classes; children are invited to birthday parties and to a “Puppets Around the World” series.
I’ve come to see “Under Night Sky,” a shadow and rod puppet production by Sarah R. Frechette of PuppetKabob. It’s the story of a young girl who listens to her grandmother tell stories of her enslaved ancestors’ escape from the South, and her mother’s determination to attend school. Though these are certainly not typical puppet show themes, Frechette wants her work to challenge students, to introduce them to important themes, and to create a visuals for concepts that they already know, so that they can better understand our language and their history.
Silliness is important in puppetry, but at Puppet Showplace, it’s more important to produce meaningful work. Frechette praises Puppet Showplace for supporting young artists. Her senior thesis at the University of Connecticut’s Puppetry Arts Program was debuted at Puppet Showplace. The theater handles marketing, production, finding an audience, and providing moral support to returning and new artists, so that they are better able to focus on the shows themselves.

I don’t know where I’m going to be living in three months after I graduate, or what I’m going to be doing.
The Monday before spring break, I completed my senior thesis and my senior ski season within 24 hours. To say the least, my time is structured a lot differently now, and this sometimes terrifies me: Am I applying to enough, and the right, jobs? Am I going to keep letting my schoolwork slide because I feel like I have more time to do it, so I do it more slowly and still end up behind?  My prescribing nurse at the school clinic told me that individuals with anxiety disorders (like myself) often feel extra afraid and overwhelmed in the face of change and restructuring in daily life, and, honestly, I think lots of non-anxiety-disordered people do, too. We worked through elementary and middle and high school to get to college, but what comes next? A grungy New York apartment? Mom’s basement? Two kids and a picket fence? Fame and fortune? A collapse of everything we’ve once known?
What helps is remembering that “what I’m going to do with my life” is a collaboration of many elements and phases, not a solitary destination. What I do with my life is the sum of everything that composes each stage I go through, because what I “do” with my life includes not only my job but also my leisure and hobbies, my interpersonal relationships, and the ways I live by my personal ethics on a daily basis. What I’m going to do with my life will ideally include having my own dog, and, if all goes well, it will allow me to spend a lot of time around trees and big clear skies while also giving me a productive, satisfying, and rewarding day job.
What I’m going to do with my life will come in phases, the first ones probably more weird and uncomfortable before I figure things out, and I am trying to acknowledge this as much as possible, until it goes fully from a scary ambiguity to a reassuring fact that opens up opportunities for change and improvement. I was very anxious about going back to school during one of our breaks my sophomore year of college (honest fact check: I don’t even remember which), feeling like I wasn’t doing well enough at the things I ambiguously felt I was “supposed” to be good at. Ah, yes, another fun and healthy anxiety-driven internal monologue. Then, I picked up the copy of the “Bob Dylan Chronicles” that floats around the couple bookshelves of my family’s home.
As I sat on my parents’ couch in my JV Swimming sweatpants from eighth grade, book open in my lap, I was immersed in the world of a young Bob Dylan who loves folk music so much that he travels alone to New York City and floats between various people’s couches, spending his days researching, writing songs, and eventually performing. Here’s a guy who was propelled to success, whether you enjoy his work or not, entirely by his own desire to immerse himself in his  art, which eclipsed his ability to follow what was considered a normal course of action (i.e., finishing school and getting a normal job).
With fewer than two months left, I’m not here to say, “Let’s all drop out of school and buy used guitars.” That’s ridiculous, and an awful use of tuition money and/or scholarships. Also, it’s 2016, and it’s becoming harder and harder to find people I can talk to about Bob Dylan outside of retirement homes. Still, during sophomore year, good ol’ Bobby D reminded me to chase the art, to determine my course of action by striving for what feels fulfilling and worthwhile. I returned to school and stopped comping clubs that made me uncomfortable. I started reading contemporary books for fun again. I started writing on my own time more often. I stopped feeling like the ways I didn’t mesh with some of the values promoted in the culture around me was not a sign that I am less intelligent or “wrong,” but just that I have something different to offer, and that I should start looking for it in different places. I started writing and editing book reviews, and I eventually took a publishing internship.
To all of us leaving one phase, about to enter a new one: Every separate piece of each day is what we “do” with our lives, regardless of where we are. Sometimes this feels ominous to me—the flip-side of “a lot of areas in which to success” is “a lot of areas in which to totally bomb and let everybody down,” as my anxious brain likes to remind me. So I’m trying to teach myself to lay down the good bricks. I try to be a good listener whenever I can, and get things done on time. I try to take the little steps for personal well-being, like exercising, and eating things outside my personal food pyramid of coffee, ice cream, and Ibuprofen. I also am trying to cultivate well-being by telling myself that things I read, visit, listen to, have conversations about, try, or explore just for fun, are also productive, because they are broadening the scope of what I have exposure to and try to understand.
I’m going to start the next phase of my life post-graduation with a nice morning run and some breakfast. As of now, that’s the only plan I have, and right now that feels okay.

“Do you want to go to Dubai in May after our finals finish?” Kathryn J. Gundersen ’17, an inactive FM writer, asked a friend last spring. Five months before this Dubai flight was scheduled for takeoff, on Christmas Day, 2014, Gundersen had discovered a “mistake fare.” She had to act fast.
In May, as planned, Gundersen and her friend arrived in Dubai on plane tickets that cost $200 round trip.
Gundersen uses Facebook pages such as “The Flight Deal” and “Secret Flying” to search for cheaper travel options. These pages mostly post deals for flights that happen to be cheaper than normal, but occasionally they’ll advertise something known as a “mistake fare.” A mistake fare, such as the fare for Gundersen’s ticket to Dubai, can be caused by anything from human error to system glitches, but most of the time is based in “fuel dumping.”
“An airline ticket has two prices,” Gundersen explains. One is the price of the actual ticket, and the other is the price of fuel. The price of fuel is what gives certain flights, especially international flights, their sky-high prices. Fuel dumping, when airlines unintentionally leave the price of fuel off the ticket price, is the main cause of mistake fares.
Gundersen traveled out of North America for the first time in college, and since, she realized that only did she enjoy it, she could do it—cheaply—on her own.
Now, Gundersen’s favorite way to release the tension of a stressful Harvard semester is to “just wander around a new city and have my mind fully on that,” she says.
“Book now. Think later. That’s my strategy,” Gundersen says. Since discovering a passion for travel, she’s made several trips, to places including London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Dubai. Her next trip? Lisbon in October, on a ticket she purchased as a mistake fare.
Gundersen notes that early mornings and late nights are best for catching mistake fares on the Facebook pages she frequents, but counts spontaneity as her best strategy.

“Dude, I walked in here and I was like ‘Holy shit, this place looks amazing,’” Kim, a 22-year-old, tells us over our fourth consecutive game of BananaGrams. She’s remembering her first night at Y2Y, Harvard Square’s only youth homeless shelter. “I had a bed that was on the bottom floor, and I crawled in there and I literally just stayed,” she recalls.
Only a few months have passed since Y2Y first opened its doors in December, but many of the young adults who fill the shelter’s beds each night feel as though they have found a home—at least for the 30 nights at a time they can sleep there.
“There’s food whenever you want to eat. There’s showers available whenever you want to shower. It’s basically kind of like a home,” Jayzena Hernandez, another guest at the shelter, says. 
Residing in the basement below the First Parish Church in Cambridge—across the street from CVS and Harvard Yard—Y2Y remains one of only two youth homeless shelters in the greater Boston area.
Over the past three years, a group of Harvard students, alumni, and professors conceived and constructed Y2Y, Harvard Square’s first peer-to-peer, trauma-informed, easy-to-access shelter for young adults experiencing homelessness. They also developed a number of guest-focused initiatives—from yoga classes to legal counseling—designed to improve guests’ stays and prepare them for the future.
The shelter has hosted 60 guests since its opening, and the vast majority have responded positively. Y2Y’s staff and volunteers acknowledge, though, that the shelter can only do so much to tackle the immense and intractable problem of homelessness.
As one guest, sitting within feet of the BananaGrams table, asked anyone who would listen: “How long can we stay here for—30 fucking days? Harvard students ain’t doing shit for us.”
Samuel G. Greenberg ’14, who co-founded the shelter along with Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, understands these constraints. Still, he believes, by creating a place where Harvard students confront the harsh realities existing just steps from the comfort of their dorms, Y2Y plays a critical role in addressing larger systemic inequality.
“It’s 200 Harvard kids saying, ‘We care. We don’t think that our peers should be homeless. Nobody should be homeless, and certainly not people our age sleeping on our doorstep,’” he says.
“In high school, one of my best friends… told me that he had been homeless for most of high school, which I actually hadn’t known,” Greenberg recalls. He’d seen many examples of inequality, both while growing up in Cambridge and studying structural inequity, but it was his friend’s story that prompted him to get more involved in public service in college.
Greenberg, who had volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter in high school, decided to devote more time to the organization. It was, he says, “the best thing I’d ever done.”
Working at the shelter exposed him to the breadth of challenges people experiencing homelessness face and the dearth of resources available in the greater Boston area. Greenberg and his friends at HSHS started to think about other ways they might combat homelessness. 
After lengthy discussions with service providers, homelessness advocates, faith leaders, and policy-makers, the need for “something for young adults” in the form of a “short-term, low-threshold, easy-to-access safe shelter” became clear. At the time, HSHS was the only shelter where many young people felt safe going, which, to Greenberg and Rosenkrantz, demonstrated the need for another youth-friendly shelter—what would eventually become Y2Y.
Harvard’s Assistant Dean of Public Service, Gene A. Corbin, who sits on Y2Y’s Advisory Board, remembers discussing Greenberg and Rosenkrantz’s initial vision. “They were involved in Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and asking all the right kinds of questions,” he says. “I was always impressed with their thoughtfulness.”
HSHS provided Greenberg and Rosenkrantz a model for student engagement and development. Y2Y staff members shadowed HSHS volunteers in order to learn more about how the shelter operated. HSHS also organized several fundraisers for Y2Y, contributing to the over $1.2 million raised to renovate the space.
Still, when Y2Y opened last semester, staff members at both shelters were anxious to see how the two Harvard Square institutions would share staff and funding. “We weren’t really sure how it was going to work,” Abigail S. Harris ’16, Y2Y’s Maintenance Director, remembers.
To alleviate this tension, the two shelters met to write a “memorandum of understanding": essentially an agreement not to step on each other’s toes. For instance, Y2Y decided not to apply to grants traditionally pursued by HSHS and sought new sources for food donations.
“It is so cool to have two student-run shelters within two blocks of each other,” Harris says. “We have to work together. It would be absolutely ridiculous if we were just these two separate entities that never spoke to each other.”
In some cases, Y2Y has forced HSHS, which was founded in 1983, to think critically about some of its own longstanding policies, specifically when it comes to gender separation. Unlike HSHS, Y2Y has gender-neutral bathrooms and living spaces.
“As a result of seeing all [Y2Y’s] work in that initiative, we’ve taken it upon ourselves to think about what we can do to make our space welcoming to people of all identities,” Isobel W. Green ’17, an administration director at HSHS, says.
Kennedy School Professor Julie B. Wilson, who has worked with both shelters, remembers that while HSHS “grew out of a crisis,” Y2Y’s policies were “systematically” designed. One area in which Y2Y is particularly methodical is in maintaining a physical space that reflects its overall mission. 
“[HSHS] is a really great shelter and everything, but it’s also really gray, really drab and very usual when it comes to homeless shelters,” Harris says. “There’s standard bunks, and they’re all lined up in the same way, and I saw that with Y2Y, there was an opportunity to do something really interesting, really cool, and really thoughtful.”
Y2Y’s open-layout, high-ceilinged, modern design aesthetic looks more like Quincy House’s renovated Stone Hall basement­—an inspiration for the architects who designed Y2Y—than a typical homeless shelter.
When Hernandez first moved into Y2Y, the first thing she noticed was “the space.” “It’s big, it’s not overcrowded, and also everything is pretty much clean. I like that a lot,” she said.
Vibrant lime green walls envelop Y2Y’s common area, and pastel blue chairs are dotted about. The far wall boasts a massive mural of stripes and spirals in splashes of neon purple and blue, painted by Kitty Zen, a member of Y2Y’s Young Adult Advisory Council.
According to Harris, who worked closely with the building committee in the months leading up to Y2Y’s opening, the architects designed the space to feel safe and comfortable for guests, a disproportionate number of whom have experienced trauma.
“The best way that we can serve those guests is to create a space that is free of trauma or at least informed by trauma and that strives to not re-traumatize our guests,” Greenberg says.
For instance, much of Y2Y’s furniture “faces the entrance, so you have eyesight on the entrance as opposed to your back to the entrance,” Harris explains. According to several Y2Y staff members, being unable to see the room’s entrance can induce trauma for those who have experienced homelessness. 
Spanning an entire wall are three-tier stacks of beds, colloquially known as “pods.” Custom designed for Y2Y, the zigzagging, interlocking nooks provide privacy and personal space for guests, while allowing staffers easy access if need be.
“Most [shelters], you’re either on the floor or need to share a room with somebody. But we each get our own individual pods, our individual bed,” Kim says. “That’s one of the unique features and one of the things I like the most.”
Hernandez also highlights the impact of the pods, particularly the small drawers adjacent to each bed. “This little cubby here, it’s great,” she says, gesturing towards her drawer. “You don’t have to share with anybody else; it’s like your own personal space.”
Every day around 6:30 p.m., a line begins to form outside Y2Y. Staff, volunteers, and guests slowly trickle through the side door of the First Parish Church, where they are all processed by Jared A. Dunham, who manages security during some evenings.
Each check-in—for staff, guests, and journalists alike—begins with the same question: “Any drugs, weapons, or alcohol on you?”
Just inside the shelter’s doors, Dunham, with wisps of gray in his beard and a black bandana over his dreadlocks, rifles through every pocket of every visitor’s bag, waving a hand-held metal detector over each person. Officially dubbed the shelter’s “Youth Worker,” Dunham also acts as a liaison between guests and volunteers. Y2Y’s Youth Workers have all experienced homelessness.
“I’m sort of a bridge that goes between the guests and students,” Dunham says, perched at a makeshift station in the stairwell between the shelter and the world outside. “What I’m doing with my experience and my background is working on empowering the volunteers and staff to empower the guests.”
Melinda R. Song ’17, a volunteer at the shelter, agrees that Y2Y cultivates positive and equitable relationships between staff and guests.
“Obviously, my life experiences are very different, and I’m in a different situation than the guests in the shelter, but there is that common humanness,” she explains. “I’ve talked to guests about… drama and relationships, and all these things we’re [all] going through as 20-year-olds.”
Still, hierarchical dynamics between guests and staff are inevitable at a homeless shelter responsible for ensuring safety and security. It is staff, not guests, who are tasked with doling out punishments, giving away beds, and serving two meals a day. These power dynamics are at play as soon as volunteers arrive each night.
While volunteers prepare dinner, guests wait outside. At 7p.m., the doors open, and soon after, the two groups converge outside the kitchen.
Though volunteers try to work with food left for them by the previous night’s staff, they still try to get creative. The pantry contains a wide range of donated food, including a seemingly endless supply of peanut butter, tomato sauce, icing, mac and cheese, and other non-perishables. Harvard University Dining Services and neighborhood restaurants, such as Dado, Market on the Square, and Au Bon Pain, also contribute food at the end of many nights.
On one Tuesday, the staff cooked an entire turkey. Another night, penne bolognese. According to guests, the food distinguishes Y2Y from other shelters. “I gotta be honest, the food is good here,” Ayisha M. Eddins, a guest, tells us. 
While the volunteers and staff are finishing up dinner—both cooking dishes themselves and picking up food from restaurants in the Square—guests begin to fill up the shelter’s common space. Some use Y2Y’s computers to research job opportunities, while others play games like Minecraft. A few sink down into one of the shelter’s many couches, needing relaxation after days that, as one guest put it, “couldn’t be any worse.”
Meanwhile, a few staff members change sheets and clorox mattresses for the one-night lotteried beds that are given out if 30-day guests are absent for the evening. Other volunteers and staff members set up nightly activities, which tonight, include yoga and a community meeting.
Concurrently, several law students from the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau set up shop in one of the back offices, where they hope to provide legal advice; case managers await conversations with guests; the medical staff gears up for the night ahead as well.
Y2Y prides itself on the resources it provides its guests, but even after dinner, many who stay at the shelter prefer not to engage in organized activities. On one night, community meeting goes entirely unattended, while yoga boasts just four participants, including the staff member who ran it. The advocacy meeting the night before had only one attendee. The legal aid office received none.
There is one resource, however, that many guests value: Y2Y’s student case managers.
During dinner, several case managers chat with one another about the night’s schedule and Y2Y’s progress, occasionally making small talk about Harvard life. Some of them even try and get ahead on schoolwork, as they wait to talk to guests.
Case managers have a flexible, but critical, role at the shelter. “The case managers are mostly supposed to be a front line to be aware of what [resources] are out there, and then connect guests with other people who specialize,” one manager, Gabriel S. Coonce ’19, explains. The case managers also work directly with guests—to fill out applications for housing, state IDs, food stamps, and other necessities.
“[Guests] can get help whenever [they] need it,” Kim says. “During the period from when you walk in to the time that you leave in the morning, there’s always someone around you—a volunteer, case manager, director—so if there’s ever any kind of issue, you can go to them.”
According to Kim, the model of one case manager per student works, in part, because it’s driven by guest feedback. “Recently, I said it was really hard to have multiple caseworkers helping you, because that’s a lot of personal information,” she explains. “Now, you can email or call your case manager on work phones and you can schedule meetings at the shelter or outside.”
Y2Y considers its guest-feedback mechanism—wherein a guest will issue a complaint, and the shelter will work to address it—one of the most important aspects of their  mission. “One of our core values is being adaptive, and I think that is really important to us because we don’t have the answers and nobody really [does],” Greenberg says. “That’s not to say there aren’t smart people working on [youth homelessness], but it is such an understudied issue.”
This lack of literature on how best to address youth homelessness is just one reason why Y2Y  is hesitant in forcing guests to partake in its initiatives. Y2Y also understands that each guest is her own individual and, as such, should not be forced to participate in a one-size-fits-all program.
“All of our programming is opt-in, and that’s because we know that our guests are coming to us at entirely different places of physical ability, mental ability,” Greenberg explains. “The best thing we can do is provide as many opportunities to engage in those processes and remove as many barriers as we can, but know that what we do is not perfect.”
Thus Y2Y continues to expand its offerings for guests, in spite of limited participation. For instance, the shelter hopes to provide more extensive legal services going forward. “Our expectation is that we’ll be able to help people with restraining orders or harassment prevention orders,” says legal volunteer Amanda I. Morejon. According to Morejon, the shelter also hopes to help guests work with housing authorities, navigate Section 8 bureaucracy, prevent wage theft, and secure unemployment benefits.
The medical department for Y2Y also plans to expand its services. Dr. Avra Goldman, who launched the program (and also is the mother of co-founder Sam Greenberg), explained that she currently helps guests out mostly on an as-needed basis. But in the near future, she plans on creating more programs to help with addiction medicine, alongside Dr. Paul Trowbridge, an addiction specialist working with Y2Y.
By around 9:30 p.m., the organized activities at Y2Y are largely concluded. At this point, guests finish eating and turn to the entertainment portion of the night. Many guests ignore the myriad DVDs on the shelves—ranging from Da Ali G Show to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid—as well as the video games (though we hear Rock Band is usually popular), opting for computer or board games instead.
This is where we find Kim holding court at the BananaGram table, where she just came off a victory. “I was an English major,” she says, explaining her fondness for the game.
“Lights off” is at 10:30 p.m., but most guests stay awake for a few hours afterwards. Others try to get to bed as soon as possible, requesting wake-up calls as early as 5 a.m. to get to work on time, or to nab one of the first showers in the morning.
According to several guests and volunteers, this crunch makes the morning shift one of the most difficult for guests and staff alike. “When you have 10 people trying to occupy four different showers, it gets a little hectic in the morning,” Kim explains. “Everyone’s getting up earlier to get into the shower first, and because everyone’s getting up earlier, they’re crankier because they still can’t get into the shower, because the other people that are waking up early are getting into the shower first.”
Because Y2Y allows guests to take showers in locked rooms—a policy that many other shelters don’t share—showers can end up lasting for hours rather than minutes.
Y2Y faces such dilemmas on a daily basis: Is it worth it to help guests feel autonomous, if that means other guests in the space are inconvenienced? In the case of showers, volunteers have decided that it is. In other cases, Y2Y’s verdict has been less clear cut and is constantly evolving with new data. “We always want to be reevaluating our work and see how we can make it better,” Greenberg says. 
One of Y2Y’s initial goals was to have their model replicated throughout the country. “From the beginning, we were trying to create a manual for how to run a shelter like this and how to assess its performance so that other sites could pick it up,” Wilson explains. To this end, Y2Y enlisted two data collection directors.
One of these directors, Isabelle Yang ’17, laid out the framework by which Y2Y keeps track of the success of the shelter and its guests from check-in through check-out and beyond. Guests are required to complete in-depth surveys before their first night at the shelter, a process staff members call “contact.”
Over the course of a guest’s 30-night stay, the data directors will collect data several more times, both directly through surveys and indirectly through qualitative feedback given to case managers. “If a guest said, ‘This sucked tonight,’ I’d put that in the nightly notes,” Yang explains. “Every time our case managers talk to a guest, they are supposed to write up a set of notes as well.”
This model allows for flexibility, Yang says. “Say a guest says to us she really likes science books, one of us can bring in science books—we’re students.” Beyond these sorts of individual feedback mechanisms, Y2Y’s methods of data collection add to the conversations surrounding big picture issues, ranging from the food they serve to the policies they enforce.
So far the team at Y2Y has spent more time collecting data than analyzing it, but Greenberg says that Y2Y does “know some stuff [about the average guest experience.] We know that at least seven of our guests have moved into long-term or transitional housing…. We know that in the month of February, 87 percent of our guests felt safe in our shelter and 100 percent would have recommended Y2Y to a friend… We know we’ve had some successes with IDs and jobs, but we don’t have a trajectory, and that’s something that’s a project.”
Understanding the average experience of a guest at Y2Y will unavoidably take time, according to many staff members we spoke to from the shelter. This is especially true, because it is difficult to stay in touch with guests after their 30-day stays. “If we had money—if we could get the donations—one thing that might be useful might be to get contact information on [guests] and check in with them periodically, offering them some incentive to complete a questionnaire,” Wilson says.
But, for now, Y2Y does not have that money to spare. The data collection team must acquire as much information as they can during guests’ one-month long visits to the shelter.
“We researched a lot of stuff,” says Yang. “The feedback we got reinforced these decisions that we made, which is a good sign…. The end goal is to make sure that that’s still the case and look out for times where there’s a disconnect.”
Perhaps because of its recent opening, the shelter still encounters unforeseen obstacles. Harris gave us an example. “We’ve had a couple of incidences of people putting used needles in the feminine hygiene disposals in the bathroom,” Harris says. “I hadn’t thought about that.” 
Volunteers at Y2Y believe that intervention at a young age may help to prevent chronic homelessness. Of course, though, what Harvard students can do in 30 days is necessarily limited.
“30 days is enough for some things—like, if someone wants to get a birth certificate or something like that, that’s relatively easy,” Benjamin Gaytan ’19, a case manager, tells us. “But if someone wants to get housing or a job, that’s a little harder—that’s not guaranteed.”
Especially as Y2Y’s first season comes to a close this April, many on the staff have been trying to determine how best to follow up with guests after their stays.
“Obviously, [30 days] is not enough for a lot of the bigger problems,” Gaytan continues. “But for a lot of the smaller stuff, I think it is. And once people have the smaller stuff, it’s a lot easier to get the bigger things done.”
This has proven to be true for many guests at Y2Y, including Hernandez. “I’m actually on my way to getting a single room occupancy through Boston housing,” she says. “I couldn’t be any more happier about news like that.”
But for guests with less certain plans than Hernandez, the idea of spending Day 31 outside of Y2Y can be daunting. The 30 day cap can also feel restrictive for the case managers, legal aids, doctors, and other staff who spend their nights working with guests.
Still, according to the data team, Y2Y is “able to accommodate a good percentage” of the youth homeless population looking for a place to stay. “It does change day by day, but it’s not like HSHS where they get 30 callers a night for three beds,” Yang says. A representative from HSHS confirmed this assessment, calling it “pretty on-point.”
In many cases, though, it’s just 30 nights at Y2Y and out. “It’s something that I don’t think we have the answer to,” Greenberg says.
When Greenberg and Rosenkrantz first conceived of the shelter, Y2Y was not only supposed to aid Harvard Square’s youth homeless population, but educate Harvard students as well.
“I think that school never made sense to me until I started working at the shelter,” Greenberg says. Without hands-on experience, he does not believe he would have entered a career in public service.
“Not to be excessively crass, but this is why people at Harvard who get the privilege of studying this shit still go into fields that actively increase inequity,” he says, explaining his desire to involve more Harvard students in Y2Y. Especially for students who didn’t grow up in places where they saw homelessness, Greenberg argues, “it is so important to volunteer.”
“If you see you have some letters here that you can move somewhere else and make a bigger board, by all means do it,” Kim says. Back at the BananaGrams table, she’s explaining her strategy. It doesn’t sound too different from Greenberg’s vision of extending Harvard’s resources in order to bolster the greater community.
“We’re a fairly small shelter doing a fairly niche thing in a deep and structurally unfair world,” Greenberg says.

A few minutes before 8 p.m. on a Tuesday night, the Currier basement is a lively scene: Some people stretch, others chat, and a few try out new maneuvers. As the clock strikes Harvard time, the scene shifts before my eyes as a cypher—a ring of breakdancers—forms in the middle of the room. One by one, students enter the circle, throwing their bodies on the floor, balancing on their hands, hovering only inches above the ground. Hoots and hollers ring out as people try new tricks or nail an impressive move.
This might as well be a “Step Up” movie.
The Harvard Breakers have street dancing down to a fine art. Open to the greater community, the Breakers host practices and attend competitions in the area, allowing members to learn breakdancing and popping styles, build a campus community, and immerse themselves in Boston’s breakdancing scene. Indeed, the Breakers embrace the culture of street dance—a culture that you can’t experience stuck solely within the confines of Harvard’s gates.
Lily Lin ’16 emphasizes the importance of participating in battles off campus regularly. “You can dance on your own in practice, but that’s not what it’s about,” she says. “It’s about experiencing the culture.”
Another dancer, Ray Qian ’16, similarly appreciates the rush of these Boston excursions: “It's one thing to do a move at practice when everyone's doing their own thing and not that many people are watching, and it's something completely different try to do that move in a battle in front of a crowd and judges.”
The Breakers are a close-knit community, pushing each other to work hard and to literally push boundaries. Such camaraderie is nowhere more evident than in Qian’s comments about Lin, his teammate since his start in the club. “She's pushed me to be better at the dance these four years, and one of the reasons I always want to improve is because she's always improving,” he says.
While group members are supportive of each other’s achievements, many members lament the lack of recognition that breakdancing and popping receive as forms of artistic expression. “It’s something I think has often been overlooked,” Keehup A. Yon ’19 says. “Even here in Boston, where there are lots of competitions every week… it’s still not seen as a legitimate dance form.”
The Breakers say that this negative stigma saddens them. Members tried to petition for a club sport title from the University, a distinction that other dance groups such as the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team already have, but the Breakers have been denied thus far. The team did, however, recently recruit a coach, an addition that has made their practices more structured and productive.
Ultimately, the Breakers place chief importance on building a community—a space where dancers from all over can improve their skills and experience the culture of the art together. Qian sums it up: “We’re a goofy family of fun-loving dancers.”

A vague echo from my elementary school days assured me that “Greenland is ice, and Iceland is green,” as I tried to justify spending my spring break in a place of rumored eternal winter. If you, too, received a concerned email from your credit card provider warning you of a large expenditure on geothermal-baked rye bread in Reykjavik, you were probably among the surprisingly large number of Harvard students who flocked like migrating puffins to Iceland last week. I can’t deny the masochistic vein that unifies us all.
For an island no bigger than the state of Ohio, this slab of hardened lava is incredibly dense in geological treasures. Our South Coast expedition took my roommate and I to the geyser that gave its name to all geysers, the legendary Gullfoss waterfall, and to my personal favorite, Eyjafjallajökul—the site of the 2010 volcanic eruption that embarrassed reporters around the world when they each tried and failed to pronounce it five times on national television.
This is a place where most of the seemingly innocent little hills you see are secretly active volcanoes (they lead double lives, like Hannah Montana!) and the taste of tap water is a palatable mix of melted glacier and sulfuric Earth mantle. Weekend outings consist of scuba diving between the American and Eurasian tectonic plates and equestrian excursions on a renowned breed of Icelandic horses with purer blood than Draco Malfoy. After a week here, it was clear to me why Iceland was bae to the Nordic Vikings and continues being so to its 300,000 inhabitants today.
Having brought up Draco Malfoy, I should also mention that I had a strong suspicion that the Icelandic people were simply the collective descendants of the blue-eyed, blonde wizarding heartthrob and villain. Luckily, Icelanders only share the Malfoys’ ensnaring beauty, and not their Slytherin-esque sneering condescension. Instead, I was charmed by their kindness—it warmed my heart even when the windchill threatened to freeze me over. These are a people that, through the centuries, have learned to survive a wintertime diet of lamb face and hoof jelly, endured weather with worse mood swings than a hormonal adolescent (looking at you, Thor), and dealt with exorbitant prices on imported goods: They’re good at seeing the bright side of things.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the departure of Florida Senator Marco Rubio from the Presidential election, disillusioned Harvard Republicans are deliberating where to direct their efforts for the remainder of the election.
A Harvard Republican Club straw poll last November indicated that 48 percent of the membership supported Marco Rubio, 48 percent Governor Jeb Bush, and four percent percent businesswoman Carly Fiorina. At the time, no respondents indicated support for businessman Donald J. Trump, though former Republican Club President Aaron I. Henricks ’16 joked in February a Harvard Trump supporter may reside in “the far reaches of the Quad.”
Rubio’s decision last Tuesday to end his bid for presidency represents the loss of the favored candidate by the Harvard Republicans and leaves the undergraduates with an unclear preferred candidate.
“For a lot of Harvard Republicans and a lot of Republicans around the country I think we lost our first and second choices in some order or another when Rubio dropped out after Bush,” Henricks said. “I think everyone is pretty dejected and pretty disappointed with how the race has gone and the way that the frontrunner has conducted himself.”
Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, who worked as National Co-Chair of Students for Rubio during the senator’s campaign, expressed an overriding sense of disappointment in how the election has proceeded, blaming the media as well as voters.
“To see a positive, issues-oriented campaign like Marco’s have to leave the race because there was no room for him in this election cycle was incredibly disappointing,” he said. “I’m disappointed in the voters for not being able to look past anger and at solutions. Most of all I’m disappointed in the media for perpetuating the Donald Trump fiasco.”
Now, with the Republican Club’s three preferred candidates out of the race, Republicans on campus are considering whether they will divert their support to Governor John Kasich, Senator Ted Cruz, or hope for an open national convention if Trump fails to secure the required 1, 237 delegates, Gwen R. Thomas ’17, current President of the Harvard Republican Club, said.
Campaigning is currently at a standstill as Thomas said club Republicans are “lukewarm” in their support for Cruz and still weighing options.
“If he’s the nominee, I think some of us will campaign for him. Right now I don’t think anyone is doing anything,” she said. “We had people working for Rubio and Bush up to this point but none of us are campaigning right now. I guess the feeling is we’re watching to see what happens.”
Thomas said many Harvard Republicans expressed apprehension over the success Trump has had in the race, and the implications his campaign has had for their party. Thomas confirmed that the club would not endorse a Trump nomination, but would aid Trump supporters within the club as needed.
“We will open up that avenue for them if they are interested, but it’s not like our club will be bussing down to Trump rallies or anything like that,” she said.
Still, many Harvard Republicans are hopeful that the efforts of Ted Cruz and John Kasich will lead to an openly contested national convention in July that would hopefully result in a non-Trump nomination.
“We had these candidates who could have taken on and easily defeated Hillary Clinton, but we’re not going to have them,” Khansarinia said. “So we’re frustrated, but nonetheless hopeful for the future, hopeful that Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and hopeful that we can take our party back.”
Trump won the Arizona primaries on Tuesday evening, and Cruz won Utah.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third consecutive year, Harvard boasted the highest number of Fulbright award recipients among peer research universities, according to data published by the Chronicle of Higher Education in February.
Thirty-one students from across Harvard’s schools received awards in the 2015-2016 program, the most recent year for which data is available.  The most recent annual tally is down slightly from the 33 students who received Fulbright funding the previous year. The last time that Harvard did not lead in its cohort of “doctoral/research institutions” was 2012, when the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor beat out Harvard by nine students. 
The Fulbright program, sponsored in part by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. State Department, provides postgraduate grants to more than 1,800 American students each year to conduct research or teach abroad in more than 160 countries, according to the Bureau’s website.
Gregory A. Llacer, Director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, said that undergraduates in particular have found success receiving Fulbright funding in recent years.
“We do remarkably well with undergraduates who apply for it,” Llacer said, referring to the Fulbright program. “It’s a very sizable number, especially when you look at our peer institutions.”
Llacer attributed some of that success to the in-House advising that specialized residential tutors provide to students applying to the Fulbright program, as well as to other awards and scholarships. A panel of Harvard faculty members and administrators evaluates every applicant before the Fulbright program reviews submissions.
“We have an amazing group of faculty and senior administrators who are on our Fulbright committee,” Llacer said. “Through those conversations with the faculty and senior administrators who play that role, the students have a voice in helping make their application stronger before the final submission.”
In addition to the 31 students who are now abroad, current Harvard seniors are beginning to receive offers for the 2016-2017 program, for which complete data is not yet available.
“So far we’ve heard a good number of individuals who have found out that they’ve been selected,” Llacer said. “We’re hopeful that as the word comes in we get more good news.”
Adela H. Kim ’16, a former Arts executive for the Crimson, is one such Fulbright finalist. She intends to study at Freie Universität in Berlin next year.
“At Harvard I study a lot of German art and French art in the war and post-war period,” Kim said. “I went to Germany sophomore and junior summer and fell in love with it, especially Berlin.”
Once Kim decided that she wanted to pursue a two-year master’s degree in Berlin, her resident tutors in Lowell House provided help for the fellowship application, she said.
“Harvard was really amazing about guiding us through the application process,” Kim said. “The fellowships advisors in Lowell were so helpful.”
Llacer emphasized that, to reap the full benefits of advising, students should start early in preparing to apply for Fulbright grants.
“Beginning in April we have a whole slew of House meetings where we talk about post-graduate fellowships in general and specifically Fulbright,” Llacer said. “Any student, regardless of whether or not they’re a graduating senior, can learn about these opportunities early and prepare for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to changing student interests, the History and Literature department has offered new fields of study and more specific subfields intended to allow for greater flexibility in students’ studies.
In addition to existing regional fields, which include American, Latin American, and European studies,  History and Literature students can now focus their studies through the temporal fields of the Medieval World, the Early Modern World, and the Modern World. The Medieval World field was introduced last spring while the other fields debuted this semester. {image=1299693 align=right size=medium caption="The Barker Center houses the History and Literature concentration."}
“What we noticed beginning about two years ago was that students were having to find workarounds to do comparative or transnational work or to study diasporic cultures, phenomena across continents, and so on within the existing fields structure,” Hist and Lit Director of Studies Lauren O. Kaminksy said of the reforms.
She said the realization prompted a review of the course over the following year and half, which ultimately resulted in the changes to the field structure. Associate Director of Studies Jennifer L. Brady emphasized the role that discussions with current concentrators and prospective students had during the restructuring of the fields as administrators sought to react to student interests.
While students in the concentration now have more options, concentration chair and English professor Amanda J. Claybaugh emphasized that their courses of study will continue to be intellectually challenging.
“What made it possible for us to loosen up on the requirements without sacrificing rigor was knowing that all the students had an advisor that knew them really well,” she said.
Concentrator Emma City ’18 emphasized the flexibility the new fields afford students. “You are no longer tied to a location,” she said.
Another aspect of the program’s increased flexibility are the subfields created last spring, which allow students to identify two or three courses that would not otherwise count towards their declared fields of study, but which support their interests and theses.
Students have used subfields to specify studies in areas such as the Pacific World and Indigeneity, Sex and Gender across the Atlantic, and U.S. and Latin America.
“Basically this is a way of giving students a structure and a scaffolding to identify something that they need to do that may be actually beyond the existing field structure and to have a way of accommodating that,” Kaminsky said.
Concentrator Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16  said she has benefited from the recent changes.
“Given the constraints of just the Europe and transatlantic focus, it wouldn’t have been enough for me,” she said of the concentration. “The new subfields allow your interests to morph and develop over time.”
The new field structure also responds to larger discussions of student interest in ethnic studies that have been taking place on campus. Kaminsky said she hopes that the new structure will allow Hist and Lit students to better specify their studies as well as recognize the work students are already doing in these fields.
Claybaugh said History and Literature hopes to keep responding to student interest through the hiring of new lecturers.
“We are really interested in what students want and that guides are hiring each year,” she said.

This month, the Cambridge City Council assigned members to its committee specializing in university relations, as the group's chair began discussing topics such as construction and community engagement with Harvard officials.
“There is no formal charge,” new chair and City Councillor Jan Devereux said of the goals of the committee, titled the University Relations and Economic Development Committee. “Any policy that falls under those two rubrics or any topic can become the subject of a hearing.”
Following her assignment as chair, Devereux met with Harvard officials and other local universities, including MIT, to familiarize herself with hot-button issues at Cambridge’s academic institutions.
The discussion ranged from the Harvard Crimson Summer Academy, current construction projects like the Smith Campus Center and House renovations, and Harvard’s engagement in the city’s public schools, according to Devereux.
“One of my personal desires is to see more young people in middle school and high school exposed to computer science,” she said. “It’d be great if professional development-wise Harvard could help secondary and middle schools figure out how to integrate it throughout the curriculum.”
Devereux said she and Thomas J. Lucey, director of government and university relations for Harvard in Cambridge, also briefly discussed the recent report outlining potential reforms to Harvard’s sexual assault prevention efforts. She stressed that such efforts would rely on a partnership between Harvard University Police and the Cambridge Police Department.
Lucey said Harvard continues to speak with the City Council on a matter of issues ranging from affordable housing to sustainability.
“We have an open dialogue with the Cambridge City Council,” Lucey said. “We’ve been engaged with many members of the Council for many years now.”
Devereux and Lucey each described an amicable relationship between the city and Harvard in recent years, striking a different tone than in years past.
“In the old days, in some cases there was more friction,” Devereux said. “At the moment there doesn’t seem to be a great deal of town-gown friction with Harvard specifically.”
Devereux said MIT currently faces Council criticism for its graduate student housing offerings. Meanwhile, Harvard remains focused on its developments in Allston.
“A lot of what Harvard is doing now is across the river.” Devereux said. “Cambridge really doesn’t have a say when dealing with Allston-Brighton, except that obviously traffic going back and forth across the bridge will ultimately impact us.”
The committee is not the only way through which Harvard can interact with the city. The Town Gown reports, a yearly statement dating back to the 1990s from each of Cambridge’s five universities, can provide the city government with statistics regarding construction, employees, and future university plans, according to Devereux.
“Those are presented to the planning board, not the City Council,” Devereux said. “It’s actually been really useful because it forces [the universities] to track data that can be looked at over time.”
Devereux said committee meetings are an extension of the entire City Council and can provide specialization when policy orders necessitate further discussion.  The five-person university relations committee also includes Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Councillors Nadeem A. Mazen, Leland Cheung, and Dennis J. Carlone.
The Cambridge City Council currently has 11 committees. Those set to make important decisions in the coming weeks and months are the zoning and ordinance committee, on which all city councillors sit, and the government operations, rules and claims committee, which is charged with selecting a new city manager following Richard C. Rossi’s announced retirement.

With vivid colors and elaborate beading, Esmeralda, a new jewelry store in Harvard Square, offers handcrafted accessories and focuses on helping other small businesses with a social conscience.
Esmeralda Lambert, who opened the retail location last October at 54 Church St. in Harvard Square, said she knew when she was young growing up in the Dominican Republic that she wanted to run her own company.
“My dream was to have my own business, to be independent, to be a successful businesswoman,” Lambert said, adding that her family of entrepreneurs inspired her.
Lambert originally planned to launch a company in her home country, but her plans changed shortly after arriving in United States in 2010. Still, she wanted to start a company that would in some way tie back to her island. Today, Lambert said she works with a team of seven Dominican women who handcraft her designs.
“By doing my jewelry is how they support their families,” Lambert said. “All the women that work with me work from home so they can take care of their kids.”
After two and a half years of producing wholesale, Lambert decided to open her own retail location, taking over the space that formerly housed TistiK, a jewelry store that used to carry her designs.
“Her gifts and jewelry are unique and beautifully crafted,” Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said. “She’ll just add to the color and the variety of the options available in the Square.”
Esmeralda also features a variety of products from global artists, spanning places including Brazil, Mexico, and Nepal. Many of the businesses Lambert represents are small and family-run, much like how she started out.
“I got so excited every time I got a new store to carry my line,” Lambert said. “So I wanted to do the same thing for other small brands like myself.”
But Lambert said she is careful to choose brands that will help her store carry out its socially conscious mission. For example, a Nepalese brand, Aid Through Trade, trains women in Nepal to make jewelry.
“People that shop here truly care about the origin of the product they are buying,” Lambert said. “They understand that each one of us really does make an impact in the world.”

UPDATED: March 24, 2016, at 5:54 p.m.
A year after it closed its beleaguered New England Primate Medical Research Center, Harvard Medical School is considering how to repurpose the space that used to house about 2,000 monkeys.
Last spring, the Medical School closed its Primate Research Center because of what it called an “increasingly challenging” financial situation. More than a dozen monkeys died or were euthanized at the center between 1999 and 2011, prompting animal rights advocates to call for the center’s closure in 2013, when information about the monkey deaths first surfaced. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched an investigation into the primate center.
The now-largely vacant site in Southborough, Mass. sprawls more than 130 acres, and the Medical School is looking for tenants and projects to fill four unused buildings. The Medical School has already demolished three of the older buildings, according to Richard M. Shea, the Medical School's associate dean for campus planning and facilities, but around 140,000 square feet of space remain up for grabs.
Shea said potential uses of the space currently include a backup data center and a “freezer farm,” which would store specimens and samples from Longwood and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In the meantime, only a maintenance crew and a few administrators populate the buildings.
“There’s not a big rush to do anything. We’re just trying to control our costs,” Shea said.
Animal rights advocates said they hoped Harvard would not use the space to conduct tests on other animals. Alka Chandna, a scientist at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal advocacy group, said Harvard should invest more resources in research that does not harm animals. She pointed to the Wyss Institute, a Harvard research group, as an institution conducting more technologically advanced and animal friendly research.
“We think Harvard should be looking forward and really expanding on the good work it has already done in developing non-animal technologies,” Chandna said.
Shea said it is unlikely, albeit possible, that the buildings will house animals again.
Alene G. Anello, a third-year Harvard Law School student who is the president of the Harvard Law School Student Animal Defense Legal Fund, also said Harvard should focus on research methods that do not involve testing animals—primate or otherwise.
“Harvard is already a leader in non-animal methods,” Anello said. “I think it would be great to have a lab that’s just dedicated to non-animal methods.”
The Medical School is also considering selling or leasing the buildings, according to Shea, but has not solidified any plans.
“We have talked informally with some folks who expressed interest, and nothing’s really come to fruition yet,” Shea said. “There’s not a ‘for sale’ sign on it.”

CORRECTION: March 24, 2016

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Controversy erupted this year over Harvard Law School’s seal, which featured the crest of the once-slaveholding Royall family. But long before the current firestorm, the story of Isaac Royall, Jr. quietly lived on in his former Massachusetts house—now a museum—and his surviving descendants, who caution against forgetting the family's history.
The seal went largely unchallenged until last semester, when a student group called Royall Must Fall began calling loudly for its removal, arguing that its associations with slavery created an inhospitable environment for minorities at the Law School. Their calls provoked intense deliberation in the following months about the seal’s future, ultimately culminating in the Harvard Corporation granting the school permission to remove the crest. The Law School is now physically eradicating all traces of it. 
The crest, which consists of three sheaves of wheat set against a blue background, represented the family of Isaac Royall, Jr., a prominent 18th century Massachusetts slaveowner who helped endow the first law professorship at Harvard. The Law School did not adopt the crest as its symbol, however, until the 1930s, and the seal did not gain widespread use until the school intensified branding efforts in the 1990s.
Most Law School alumni and faculty were unaware of the story behind the seal, which did not figure largely into the school’s identity, until legal historian Daniel R. Coquillette published research on the subject in 2000. A committee tasked with reconsidering the seal’s use released a report earlier this month, writing that it is “only recently, because of Professor Coquillette’s research, that Dean Minow began telling incoming students of the association [to slavery].”
A descendant of  Isaac Royall, Jr.’s, eight generations later, grew up with the story of his contribution to Harvard, and knew about the crest’s link to her family and its slaves before Coquillette unearthed that information. Sixty-five-year-old global health consultant Julia Royall, who now lives in Seattle, recalled learning her family history as a child. She said that preserving this history was important to her relatives, and said an older cousin who was a historian even wrote articles about the family for a New England publication.
Julia Royall said she did not speak to anyone at the Law School during the process to change the seal, but her personal ties to the school extend beyond her lineage. Her husband Brian G. Kahin ’69 graduated from the Law School in 1976, and—like many students at the time—he did not know the story behind the seal and endowed professorship bearing the family’s name until his wife informed him.
Julia Royall’s ancestral affiliation with the school’s crest did not, however, imbue it with any significant meaning for her. “I’m aware of the shield, but it certainly had no sacred place in my life,” she said.
But she has remained active in preserving her family’s history by other means. For many years, she served on the board of the family’s old estate—the Royall House and Slave Quarters—which the Daughters of the American Revolution converted into a museum at the turn of the 20th century. The family’s slaveholding legacy figures prominently into the museum’s programming; staff give tours of the slave quarters and discuss in length the injustices of slavery.
Royall House and Slave Quarters Co-President Peter Gittleman said that while museum staff closely followed the movement to change the seal at the Law School, the decision to remove it will not affect the museum’s tours, which have long emphasized both the Royalls’ slaveholding background and their connection to the Law School.
“For the past half of the year, people have been saying ‘who knew, who knew’ and we knew!” Gittleman said.
Gittleman strongly believes that removing the seal does not change the Royall story. He worries, however, that institutional memory is short and subsequent generations of Law students could forget the school’s connection to the prominent slaveholding family. The same fear is articulated in a dissenting opinion on the seal change, authored by Law professor Annette Gordon-Reed, that accompanied the committee’s report.
“The fact is it makes no difference to us whether the Royalls’ sheaves of wheat are on the seal or not,” Gittleman said, “But we would love to make sure that every generation of Harvard Law students understands where the Royall money came from.”
Julia Royall reiterated that her family's story must persist, but said she approves of the crest’s removal and the activism surrounding it.
“This stuff is important and near and dear to my heart,” she said, pointing to her work promoting African leadership in Africa and countering racism in the United States.
However, she sees the seal change—as well as similar name changes—as constructive only if their impact transcends symbolism and history and propels substantive progress on larger racial issues.
“I think the impact of the shield is symbolic. The challenge is to make it more than that,” she said. “The challenge is to make it animate the struggle to move forward on leveling the playing field. My hope is people will change, and it will ignite present Law students and faculty with a new bit of fire about doing the right thing.”

Harvard men’s lacrosse fielded its first team in 1881, well over a century before Boston University established its own program in 2014. Few expected a crosstown rivalry to develop as quickly as it has, but with a narrow 9-8 loss to the Crimson last year, the Terriers showed that they are quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with.
Entering its Tuesday night matchup at Harvard Stadium, BU looked to snap a five game losing streak against against the Crimson and earn its first win in the all-time series. The game was tied, 5-5, at halftime, but just as it has in numerous other contests this season, Harvard dug a hole for itself by allowing the Terriers to surge out to a commanding 9-5 lead in the second half.
The Crimson pushed back to bring the score to 9-8, and found itself in a man-up situation with 1:28 to go in the fourth quarter. However, sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek had his close-range shot blocked by a lunging save from BU junior goalie Christian Carson-Banister, and Harvard did not muster another attempt on goal after that.
With the nailbiting victory, the Terriers (7-2, 2-1 Patriot) not only earned their first ever triumph over the Crimson, but also set a new school best for most wins in a season with six games still left on their schedule. After going 2-12 in its inaugural campaign and 6-8 last year, BU has a chance to finish with its first winning record as well. Harvard (4-4, 0-1 Ivy), meanwhile, is back at .500, dropping its fourth straight after a promising 4-0 start.
“I think we didn’t play at the level that we know we are capable of,” Crimson freshman faceoff specialist Eric Wang said. “BU played great but we missed opportunities offensively and defensively and just failed to execute.”
No single player or unit pushed the Terriers over the top on Tuesday, as they benefitted from an especially strong offensive showing from the midfield and stout defensive pressure that held Harvard scoreless for a 31:17 stretch at one point in the game.
Junior midfielder Cal Dearth stepped up when it mattered most, scoring three straight goals for BU across the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth to extend his team’s lead from 6-5 to 9-5. He tormented the Crimson throughout the match with his speed, which was particularly on display during the buildup to his last goal, when he cut through the defense to find a wide-open shot from about 10 feet. Dearth finished with four goals and two assists, leading all players with six points.
“They were able to take advantage of some bad sliding decisions and move the ball quickly for Dearth to get shots,” said Harvard defender and co-captain Stephen Jahelka, who unfortunately missed the game due to injury. “He is a tremendous shooter and it was on display on Tuesday.”
On defense, the Terriers primarily used a zone look to deny the Crimson after it started the game firing on all cylinders with four goals in the first quarter. With the switch in tactics, BU was able to hold Harvard to just nine shots and one goal in the second and third periods.
Even more important than the tactics, however, was the hustle the Terriers showed across the field. They collected 42 ground balls to the Crimson’s 28, including 18 in the fourth quarter to stem Harvard’s rally and hold on for the win.
“I think ground balls was definitely a huge part of the game, Wang said. “Any time you lose the ground ball battle it’s hard to win. We know we definitely have a lot of work to do before our next game.”
For the Crimson, attackmen Devin Dwyer and Morgan Cheek carried the load offensively as they have for much of the season. After passing his personal best for goals in a season last week in just the seventh game, Dwyer, a senior, added four more against BU along with one assist. Cheek, a sophomore, also tacked on two goals and two assists. Outside of the attacking unit, however, Harvard only saw one goal come from a midfield player, sophomore Sean Coleman.
“I think we’re still finding the best combination of midfield lines,” Jahelka said. “[We’re] trying to figure it out right now so the chemistry level is high between linemates during the final post-season push.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maybe I was a little too hopeful the first time around.
So sure, miracles don’t happen. After winning six in a row and after a struggling Cornell upset an undefeated Penn squad, the Harvard women’s basketball team stood poised to make a run for the Ivy League title or shake things up trying.
Having watched the Crimson beat Cornell twice and take Princeton to overtime, it looked as if Harvard could at least pull off an upset heading into the last weekend of the season.
Sure enough, I was wrong. The Crimson fell to Princeton and Penn on the road the next weekend, setting up a winner take all matchup between the two Ivy League heavyweights in their last game of the season. Penn took the Ivy League crown but both got the chance to dance last weekend—and both lost in the first round. Harvard was invited to the WNIT where they dropped their first round matchup to Hofstra.
I’ll spare the details but let’s just say last weekend wasn’t the best showing for Ivy League women’s basketball.
On the surface, Harvard’s season went exactly as planned. Picked to finish in third by the Ivy League Preseason Media Poll, the Crimson did just that. To be quite honest—and I promise I’m not the only one who thought this—the preseason poll was pretty generous.
After dropping five in a row at one point and going 5-8 in their nonconference schedule, Harvard looked as if it would top of last years lackluster season with an even worse one.
Going even farther back to before the season started, co-captain Kit Metoyer hadn’t started a game until her junior season and classmate Shilpa Tummala had sat the better part of three years due to injuries. Add seven freshman to the mix and the fact that coach Kathy Delaney-Smith lost her two leading scorers to graduation and you realize just why third place looked really generous in November.
Somehow though, the preseason poll turned out to be pretty spot on when it came to Harvard. Sure it had Princeton taking the title over Penn, but a season removed from a 30-0 regular season and a win at the tournament Princeton definitely looked like the favorite.
If I can interrupt myself a bit, I’ll just say Harvard women’s basketball surprised most people in the league this year. Co-captain Annmarie Healy finished second in scoring and third in shooting percentage in the league. Metoyer and Tummala closed out the season as two of the best three-point shooters in the conference. Even with them leaving in May, Harvard has some serious freshman talent and a strong presence inside with junior Destiny Nunley.
The season was far from a disappointment and if anything it’s a shame what turned out to be one of the better senior classes in recent years left Cambridge without an Ivy League championship. Regardless, Coach Delaney-Smith has the pieces and with another big or two the Crimson will be back in contention next year.
I won’t, however, dwell on a season where Harvard finished second or third for the eighth year in a row. The Crimson’s season does, however, present an interesting twist as the league will be moving to a conference tournament next year.
But first a moment of silence for the tried and true regular season conference record champion.
Alright, I think that was more than enough.
Despite the dominance of Princeton, Harvard, and Penn in recent years, this season more than any in the recent past shows just how much anyone in the league can pull an upset on a given night. Add this to the fact that one of the most dominant classes in Ivy League history—yes in Ivy League history—is graduating from Princeton in May and you realize a conference tournament might just be what the Ivy League needed.
I mean really, there’s no reason why a Cornell squad that finished the season 6-8 should have beat a Penn squad that was undefeated and that had beat a Princeton squad that went undefeated a year ago and returned four of its five starters from last years historic season—but they did.
It’s because of wins like Cornell’s and frankly because Harvard hasn’t been able to get over the hump for the past few years why coach Delaney-Smith’s squad and even the league as a whole should be pretty excited to have a conference tournament decide the league champion. The departure of Princeton’s seniors certainly helps my case, but barring WNIT appearances, the last time Harvard played postseason basketball was in 2007.
Had the conference tournament existed the Crimson would’ve played in every one since. Let that sink in for a minute.
Add this to the fact the last time the Crimson posted a losing record was in 1994 and you realize Harvard could’ve been and might continue to be a perennial attendee at the Ivy tournament.
All things considered, and even if Harvard had lost every one of these conference tournaments, just the chance to play beyond a pretty definitive 14 games is something that the league needs. When you really think about it, Michigan State’s loss to Middle Tennessee State was just the Blue Raiders trying to be like Cornell women’s basketball. I know it seems like I’m a bit obsessed with Cornell’s upset, but the real issue with Cornell’s big win is that it didn’t matter—Penn still won the conference. Had the upset come in the conference tournament maybe it just wouldn’t be just me talking about it then.
I’ll leave you with this: eighteen years ago Harvard became the first (and still the only) No. 16 seed to upset a No. 1 seed in NCAA basketball history. Let’s just say coach Delaney-Smith is no stranger to high stakes playoff basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three years battling to get on the court, senior Patrick Steeves is refusing to leave.
The upperclassman, who sat out his first three seasons in Cambridge due to recurring injury, confirmed late Tuesday that he will transfer to another school for at least the 2016-2017 season. As a graduate transfer, Steeves would have at least one year of additional basketball eligibility—two if he receives the medical waiver that many expect he will from the NCAA.
Although Steeves said that he has received interest since Harvard’s late December run to the finals of the Diamond Head Classic, he was only recently granted his release from the school—allowing him to begin the transfer process in earnest. Per the senior, he is still “in the exploratory phases” of finding out where he wants to go.
“The time when I got a feel for whether that would be possible was after the Hawaii tournament,” Steeves said. “That’s when people started talking about it and I considered it a real option.”
In other conferences, students who sit out all or nearly all of their season—either intentionally or due to injury—are given another year of athletic eligibility. Those athletes have the option of either taking five years to complete their undergraduate degree or enroll in graduate school for the fifth year. The Ivy League is different: the conference prohibits graduate students from competing on college teams, undermining a common strategy at larger universities.
While some football players can get fifth seasons by strategically sitting out a spring semester, basketball spans both semesters and eliminates that possibility. Consequently, Ivy athletes with serious injuries—like Andrew Van Nest ’09 or Shonn Miller (Cornell ’15)—often transfer after graduation. Miller, who sat out his junior season after undergoing shoulder surgery, averaged 12.3 points and 5.2 rebounds a game for Connecticut this year after transferring.
A first-team All-Ivy player, Miller received attention from around the country (“I think Duke, North Carolina, and Ohio State were the only three schools he didn’t hear from,” said then-Cornell coach Bill Country last May), while Van Nest signed locally with Boston College.
Steeves, who did not disclose any specific suitors, noted that he had heard from “mostly mid-major school with a few power conference [programs] thrown in.” The senior added that he expected to know his full set of options later in the semester, when schools were done with postseason play and players had declared for the NBA draft.
“Grad transfers fill holes for people who leave for the draft and transferred,” Steeves said. “Even the schools who are done with the season don’t know their situation with scholarships for next year.”
In the interim, Steeves has already begun to prepare for the process. He is studying to take the GMAT in the coming weeks and has begun scouting potential fits based on their graduate programs in business and Applied Mathematics, his undergraduate major. For a senior who did not enter this season with defined expectations, it has been a significant change.
“Even coming into this senior season I wasn’t sure I would be healthy to play and I didn’t know how much or how I was going to play,” Steeves said. “People started bringing it up to me in December and I thought about it for a bit but at the end of the day it was kind of a no-brainer to keep it going for one or two more years.”
