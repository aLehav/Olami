After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Years and Years gave an energetic crowd what it wanted: an excuse to dance and smile through the light rain that began to fall on Friday afternoon. The group tamped down its characteristic dark undercurrent in favor of a fun-loving appeal that brought Justin Timberlake to mind. Frontman Olly Alexander, clad in a gorgeous cream jumpsuit with a rainbow stripe, gave up every word with an easygoing, jubilant energy. Even with only one album under their belts, a set of originals from Years and Years is exciting and infectious, and a “Hotline Bling” cover actually came across as one of the set’s low points.
Action Bronson swaggered through a triumphant set, reveling in the sizable corner of the hip-hop world he’s come to inhabit. In case you haven’t been keeping tabs on him, the rapper has his own food show with VICE now, called “F*ck, That’s Delicious.” The rapper’s set probably featured food most prominently out of all the sets this weekend: He smashed a watermelon that had been confiscated from a member of the crowd and later brought out his friend and legendary chef Mario Batali. Bronson’s boisterous self-deprecating humor made for an engaging show; the slight edge of humility (“Who the fuck would ever think you’d see this face on TV?”) combined with emphatically-delivered bars (“At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli”) kept the performance engaging the whole hour long.
Big Grams seems almost too much like a mashup oddity to work well live (the group formed from the union of electro-pop duo Phantogram and legendary rapper Big Boi), and the trio had a bit of an awkward rapport onstage, but that didn’t stop them from putting on a pleasurable show. In fact, that awkwardness was part of the appeal of the live performance—Phantogram’s Sarah Barthel openly expressed her surprise and delight at every new song as the trio rolled through the latter half of the setlist. The pleasure of watching Big Grams is the pleasure of watching a group still a little bit in disbelief at its own existence. One of the set’s highlights was a mashup of Outkast’s “Mrs. Jackson” with Phantogram’s “Mouthful of Diamonds.”
Father John Misty brought his unique persona and voice to the Honda Stage in the late afternoon. Onstage, the wily, unapologetic lunatic that frontman Josh Tillman has woven into Father John Misty’s public persona—take a look at the band’s Twitter feed for a glimpse of that—took a backseat to the rocking compositions of their 2015 album “I Love You, Honeybear.” Tillman performed with his entire body, writhing on the stage and swooping with his guitar like it was an extension of his body. He has a strange sort of charisma for a frontman; for all the hubbub he ironically invites online, he’s an incredibly earnest performer, almost to the point of awkwardness. For a little while after his band had left the stage at the end of the show, he remained, meekly waving and bowing. “True Affection” and “Holy Shit” formed the climactic heart of the set.

The London Souls did their best at the GovBallNYC stage to get the crowd pumped on the first day of the festival, but not even their dynamic guitar solos could excite the audience. The dreary weather and drizzling rain probably did little to help excite the already lukewarm, early crowd, nor did their inexperience—it was their first time at Governors Ball—but for the few fans jamming at the front of the crowd, the upbeat rock opener impressed with a strong performance that reminded everyone why the band had been invited back to their hometown of New York to perform on Randall’s Island.
Fortunately for them, Black Pistol Fire benefitted from the tent over the Bacardi House stage that shielded their set from the rain—or was it the smaller floor that pushed crowd members closer together? Either way, this rock group succeeded where The London Souls failed in electrifying the audience with their performance. The band and the fans seemed to feed off one another, building upon each other’s energy until guitarist and lead vocalist Kevin McKeown dove off the stage and surfed the crowd, who went wild at the chance to hold him up. The adrenaline seemed to have gotten to him once he was back on his feet, and he blew off steam by releasing his pent-up energy onto his guitar. After McKeown smashed the instrument into several pieces, which he subsequently threw into the crowd, Black Pistol Fire left the stage, leaving in their wake the audience thirsting for more.
Meg Mac, fresh off a tour opening for D’Angelo, performed at the Honda stage on the first day of Gov Ball. Despite the event being her first music festival in New York and second ever in the U.S., she used her crooning vocals to seduce the crowd into enjoying her performance as much as she clearly was. Wearing an outfit as rich as her voice—she looked stunning in an all-black outfit with guipure-like detailing—the Aussie singer roused the small crowd of concertgoers with her soulful songs from her 2015 EP, “MegMac.” Few could have established the intimacy she did with her audience, especially on the open fields of Randall’s Island.
Heloise Letissier, singer-songwriter of Christine and the Queens, brought her signature quirkiness to the stage in a grey suit that belied the excitement she would soon invite. Along with four other talented dancers, the lead singer shimmied her way to the crowd’s approval. Midway through her set, she took the time to send an important message to her audience. “This is a free zone,” she insisted. “You can be who you want to be. If you want to be a bicycle, fuck it!” And free it was as hips started shaking and arms waving, audience members joining Letissier in her eccentric but fun movements. Holding a bouquet that could have come straight from the cover of her self-titled debut album, she gave a shout-out to Beyoncé and Rihanna, representing them as roses, while referring to herself as a wilted flower stem. Her reason? To show that everyone flowers in their own way. The powerful image lingered even as Letissier left the stage.

What’s live music? It’s a question that gets asked frequently with respect to electronic music specifically—can you really have a “live” show from an electronic musician if all they do is press play and maybe adjust some levels? A traditionalist might tell you that true live music must include live instruments and some demonstration of technical skill. Some pop-centric idealists will tell you that what happens onstage isn’t nearly as important as the community in the crowd: a group of people who love the same music dancing to remember and/or forget.  Those two intersect at a crucial point—a point where gifted musicians wield the power that only they bear to create a meaningful community that didn’t quite exist beforehand—and Jamie xx gave Governors Ball a set that hit that sweet spot on the nose.
Creating this community isn’t as simple as selling a lot of records and relying on those to draw some sort of distinctive crowd. It’s about what you do with that crowd once they get there, and Jamie’s set on Friday evening in the big Bacardi tent demonstrated an intuitive understanding of that. One of the most intriguingly jarring moments of the set was when the DJ played a lightly edited remix of The Human League’s smash hit “Don’t You Want Me.” That 35-year-old track was probably the most well-known song played all weekend at Gov Ball (if you discount the Prince covers that peppered the weekend), and the arrival of its chorus prompted the crowd to bellow in recognition and joy. Why would Jamie xx possibly want to upstage himself with a track from the ’80s, something that doesn’t quite exude the DJ’s style? Perhaps it was a move of inclusion—those in the crowd unfamiliar with the artist whose friends had dragged them to the tent would probably recognize this song. After the one-two punch of “Don’t You Want Me” and an instrumental version of Drake’s recent hit “One Dance,” spaced out eyes turned into bobbing heads.

Michael L. McGlathery:
I have a hard time shaking the surreal feeling that takes hold as soon as one enters a music festival. To have been staring at an event’s extensive lineup—dissecting conflicts, salivating over long-time favorites, and making new discoveries—and to finally find oneself inside the extensive reality of the actual festival—the music coming from real speakers on real stages played by real, physical humans, a crowd of fellow fans grooving around you—is invariably surreal.
Not all of the strangeness that’s hard to absorb at these events is pleasant. Here are some of the things I experienced in the first few hours of Governors Ball’s 2016 iteration:
In other words, today’s music festivals can be a great place to explore the crossroads between utopia and dystopia. If you’re in a cynical mood, it can be hard not to notice how extensively events like these are steeped in our society’s vices: narcissism, class privilege, hedonism, consumerism, ignorance. Weekend passes to Governors Ball start around $300. People aren’t just preoccupied posting their experiences at these festivals on social media; when they take a video of a show, they often don’t even focus on the performer and prefer to take selfie videos. It’s hard to tell whether some people are actually enjoying the music or just the opportunity to get irresponsibly wasted. I’m not saying those people are immoral or unworthy of such an experience (I’m one of those people too!). I’m just saying they’re not quite at their best.
For all that, though, these festivals don’t get completely mired in their sometimes-obnoxious negatives. Even the show with all the drunk teenagers—that was Action Bronson—was infectiously fun, and that was because of those teenagers, in part. Bronson’s special brand of irreverent, sometimes-whiny hip-hop fed off of their angsty energy. And as cringe-worthy as it can be to see, a festival with a tent dedicated to taking care of the uncontrollably drunk and making sure they’re okay isn’t the worst place in the world for teenagers to experiment with binge drinking.
The hedonism that pervades the crowds at these festivals is a part of their essence and a part of their appeal and their magic, like it or not. A delightfully carefree performance from Big Grams was punctuated by bubbly affirmations from Sarah Barthel, who was, in her own words, “So high.” The Strokes, who sounded as tight, perfect, and iconic as could be hoped for, have always depended on the flashpoint between hedonism and a deep malaise for their appeal. Action Bronson smoked a joint as he hoarsely spat lyrics into the mic, later admitting that he smoked “too soon.” Father John Misty provided a (perhaps ironically) earnest counterpoint, lost in the lush landscape of his brilliant compositions throughout his show. The liveliest point of Beck’s performance came with the fun-loving slacker anthem “Loser”: Even the picnicking 30-somethings in the crowd got up and jumped around for that track.
You can love music festivals or hate them; you can be cynical about their intentions (this particular festival was just acquired by the gargantuan corporation LiveNation); you can accuse them of losing their soul. There’ll never be another Woodstock. But while there’s still a Governors Ball, you can still search for that enduring spirit in the cracks.

Mila Gauvin II:
Although I arrive before the gates open, confusion as to where and how to get my wristband, the sole key to getting inside, delays my entry into the festival. Hundreds of people in their teens and early twenties have already lined up, waiting impatiently to be let in; they form a vibrant mosaic of both eclectic styles and eccentric colors. When I finally get my wristband, I rush inside after them, and I am immediately accosted by the essence and energy that is Gov Ball. The four big stages, the food stands, the bathroom lines, people’s bare skin—the festival has only just begun but it is already in full swing.
I make my way to all of the stages to make sense of the confusion that was once the empty fields of Randall’s Island. While the app is helpful in helping me keep track of who is performing when and where, as well as where everything is, I feel like I am being swallowed whole by the immensity of the festival until I go to one of the first performances of the day: The London Souls. Although the crowd isn’t as pumped for the performance as the band itself is, I understand why I am here: to enjoy and bask in the wide array of different artists I am about to see.
Each performance I attend is marked by the push and pull of people trying to get by (most attempting to get push forward, closer to the stage); by the songs added to my playlists as I discover new favorites from different artists; by the ringing in my ears once the music gives way to my fellow festival-goers’ speech as everyone disperses from the stages. My phone’s storage is bursting with the pictures and videos I have taken, most of them blurry and unintelligible, but I keep them anyways to immortalize the memory of my being here.
Enjoying one of the many perks of my status as a journalist, I revel in the opportunity to interview Meg Mac. Although she isn’t too well-known yet in the U.S., her undeniable talent will soon push her to the fame she has already gained in her native Australia. Her music, fashion style, and quiet demeanor endear her to me almost immediately, but I am too shy to ask for a picture with her. Oh well, maybe next time.
Though he is not due to perform for another two days, traces of Kanye permeate the festival, hinting at his long-awaited first pre-Pablo performance. From Christine and the Queens’s haunting mashup/cover of Yeezy’s “Heartless” to the poster of Kanye’s head a fan holds up during Duke Dumont’s set to people already planning their Sunday around his performance, the headliner everyone is waiting to see has already infiltrated Randall’s Island.
My feet sore and my stomach grumbling—I’ve barely sat down the entire day, and the food here is too overpriced for me to bother paying for more than one meal—I enjoy The Strokes’s encore performance, despite the fact that it clashes with the clamor of the last-minute fireworks. Leaving the festival turns out to be the worst part of the evening, and not just because it means I am leaving all the fun behind. The thousands of people unsuccessfully rushing to leave before the rush have unintentionally become the rush, and there I am in the middle of it all. Although it takes me almost an hour to get off the smaller island and onto the main one, I can’t help but look forward for the next day, however long it may be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is a race of one?
Each morning, I would ride the bus to the sheer white answer. From kindergarten to eighth grade, I was the Asian spectacle. Black hair, yellow skin, ugly eyes, weird snacks, stupid pronunciations, alien associations. I was the one who was put at my own table by the kindergarten teacher from week one. My presence was a deadly contaminant, the disinfectant being some chanting of "ching ching chong" or "Hey, look at my eyes!" I would run up to half empty lunch tables only to be told that there were no seats. And if I dared to take one, a bitter and prolonged exodus would begin.
In second grade, I finally found to courage to admit to a teacher that something was wrong. "Can you tell me what they are doing?" her soft voice asked. For the length of eternity, I stood unmoving. My face flushing red with each second, trying to come up with just one word, one specific thing that could show the world what they were they doing.
But how could I? The words "Go away" are a way of life, not a single action. They were not putting gum in my hair or taking my money. They were sweeter than that, pretending to play hide and seek when I tried to join recess games so I could hide away forever.
Sometimes they would compliment the bowl cut my dad cut for me or the "brand name" clothes that had belonged to my older cousin. “Oh, you're so pretty," they would say, "I wish I were you." Their sarcasm bursting like capillaries with laughter.
When the last day of eighth grade finally came, I walked out on nine years of my life in silence. I was going to a high school where 20 percent of the people looked like me, where caring about school was the absolute norm and not the exception.
The anecdotes that people would tell, the "nerdy" things that interested them—for the first time I felt the euphoria of existing.
But sometimes when I found myself laughing, the past would wash over like a dream. I wanted to forget, to choke the nightmare insecurities and pretend that humiliation couldn’t have happened to me. But the question haunted me: What would they say now? In the span of a few months, I had learned to be normal. And I realized painfully that the new me would have dealt with things differently.
I shouldn’t have taken myself so seriously. I should have fought harder against my parents and gotten the right clothes. Or maybe I could have figured out how to truly do it right—how to have the confidence and self pride that would draw people towards me as me. But how could I have come to know this if my concept of race was “weird” rather than “human”?
With each year’s distance, the question moved further away, fading into a random curiosity. So when it jumped out of amnesia, as I posted more photos to Facebook of my time in Japan, my entire mind became clutched with the anxiety of the old question. How beautiful would they find these pictures? Would they see these pictures and realize that I could be happy too? That there is more to this world than the white well they were born into?
And somehow, for the first time I realized the actual answer: Nothing. If they saw me now, they would say nothing. I had only been a small, silent part on the sidelines of their memories. What they did to me was insignificant because they never did anything. They had never argued with me, never seen my tears, never told me to die, never outrightly told me to leave. Carelessly, they had tolerated me. Making sure that I sat at the farthest seat so I could have the privilege of existing in the same room.
But tolerance is fragile—it depends solely on silence, isolation, and erasure. Synonyms of tolerance: endure, condone, forgive me for existing. Tolerance crumbles when those who are on the sidelines start walking towards the middle. And while I lost the battle by submitting to those around me and leaving, it’s funny to think that one day I will win the war. Living here, it is so painfully obvious: Japan is real, China is real, I am real. I might have been alone, but my race is not a race of one.

The Cambridge Police Department warned locals about an ongoing ATM skimming scheme affecting the city.
According to an email sent to residents last Tuesday, a skimming device—hardware that reads and stores a person’s credit or debit card information at an ATM—was recently discovered attached to a machine at a local convenience store in Cambridge. CPD’s investigations unit is currently in the process of “actively following up on the incident,” according to email, and has placed patrols in the area to check ATMs in locations frequently affected by skimming.
“During this busy travel season, the Cambridge Police Department would like to remind ATM users to be aware of skimming devices at area ATMs,” the email, sent to a local listserv that services Cambridge residents, read. “These skimming devices are being used as part of an ongoing scheme by thieves to steal account information from customers and to defraud banks.”
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote that major commercial areas such as Harvard and Central squares are often the target for credit fraud schemes, though he noted that Harvard Square was “relatively quiet” throughout 2015, with 16 incidents reported to the police department over the course of the year.
In comparison, 37 different accounts of ATM skimming were reported in East Cambridge in 2015, comprising a little under a quarter of the total incidents of ATM and credit card fraud reported to CPD in last year.
CPD urged residents to report any ATM machines that look as if they have been tampered with to the police department.

We really do still want to be out and about making the most of our time off from school—but the summer laziness is also real. At this point, a lot of us aren’t necessarily looking to do anything that requires too much effort. And it doesn’t get much more low key than watching movies and listening to music. This week, Flyby is filling you in on film and live music events in and around Cambridge—all you have to do is get yourself there, then sit back and enjoy.
“Pulp Fiction”Monday at 7 p.m. | Coolidge Corner Theatre
Start your week by venturing outside the Harvard bubble to see this cult classic playing in Brookline. It’s a bit of a commute, but worth it for the chance to see Tarantino’s iconic film on the big screen.
“Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made”Monday at 9:30 p.m. | The Brattle Theatre
Watching this documentary about three guys who created a shot for shot adaptation of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” was probably not initially in your plans for the day, but if the idea of anything Indiana Jones related isn’t enough to get you out tonight, the Brattle’s delicious popcorn might be.
Music at the Farmers’ MarketTuesday at noon | The Science Center Plaza
Pick up some local treats at the Farmers’ Market, then kick back and listen to this week’s featured music at the Plaza. The lineup starts with indie-folk duo Strangers by Accident at noon, Harvard student Kate Diaz ’19 at 1:30 p.m., and cover band Malibu Sands Beach Club at 4:30 p.m.
Karaoke Night at Charlie’s KitchenTuesday at 8 p.m. | Charlie’s Kitchen
Charlie’s Kitchen boasts not only a beer garden and burgers, but also a weekly karaoke night. Don’t miss the chance to take the mic and live your American Idol fantasy this Tuesday.
Caribbean soul group Zili MisikThursday at 8 p.m. | The Beat Brasserie
For a change of pace, head to the Beat Brasserie in Harvard Square on Thursday for some good food and atmosphere featuring Zili Misik’s “New World Soul” music.
Outdoor Movie: “Cinderella”Friday at sundown | DCR’s Hatch Shell
This 2015 remake may not be able to compete with the original “Cinderella,” but the weather’s looking warm for Saturday—so why not take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy a free movie by the river?
Midnight Movie: “Fright Night”Saturday at 11:59 p.m. | Somerville Theatre
If you’re daunted by a) horror movies b) staying up past 12 a.m. or c) both of the above, this event is probably not for you. But to those late-night cinefiles up for something scary, Somerville Theatre is the place to be on Saturday night.
New Movies on Netflix!Anytime, anywhere
If going outside this week doesn’t appeal to you, you’re still in luck. Netflix has added a whole slew of movies and shows this month, including Oscar winners “The Big Short” and “Spotlight.” If you’re feeling nostalgic, “Mean Girls” and the “Back to the Future” trilogy are also available to stream whenever the mood strikes.
