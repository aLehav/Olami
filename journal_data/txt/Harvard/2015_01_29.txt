After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hepatitis C, a liver-damaging virus, is best known as a “shadow epidemic” suspected of causing precipitous rise in rates of liver cancer, a disease increasing faster than any other cancer in the United States. The disease affects more than four million Americans and is disproportionately found among society’s marginalized populations, including prison inmates and injection drug users. An estimated 130 to 150 million people are infected worldwide.
Though these statistics and stories are worthy of alarm, costs of treating this epidemic are far from urgent. In April 2014, the World Health Organization approved two new oral drugs that fight hepatitis C, but their costs are far from affordable. Gilead Science’s 12-week course of the hepatitis C drug Solvadi costs $84,000, which translates to $1,000 per pill. Johnson & Johnson’s drug Olysio, often prescribed with Solvadi, costs $66,360 for the 12-week regimen.
Pharmaceutical companies oftentimes justify these high costs by simply pointing to the length of time and amount of money that is invested in the research and development process. According to the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of America, research and development for just one medicine takes 10 to 15 years and more than $1 billion.
In spite of these undoubtedly expensive costs, such an outrageous and unaffordable cost of treatment in the midst of a growing epidemic should not be allowed. While pharmaceutical companies may refer to a large R&D budget as justification for its outrageous drug treatment costs, human suffering of disease is ignored. Many of those at-risk for the disease, including inmates, can barely afford basic resources, let alone a $1,000 hepatitis C pill.
The influence of economics and big data by decision makers has been growing within government policy compared to perspectives from historians, anthropologists, and psychologists. Prominent ideas held by academics claim that complex treatments simply cannot be done in resource-poor settings or among uneducated, marginalized populations of society. The marginal revolution of economics has convinced us that we live in a world strapped by financial and human resources. And yet, as economic arguments and cost-benefit analysis become priorities in global policy, we must evaluate social constructions that lie behind outrageous claims of dollar amounts and profit. We must keep in mind the politics and social climate that create our conceptions of cost and benefit. What defines cost? Who is worthy of benefit? Where does the marginal dollar that can alleviate costs lie? For those in need, high drug treatment prices become more than a dollar sign: They are dollar-value designators of those worthy to live and those unlucky enough to die.
We’ve seen the disastrous effects of prioritizing costs over human realities throughout history. The outrageous modern day costs of hepatitis C drugs recall the struggles of the war against HIV/AIDS. Those most at risk of getting infected with HIV/AIDS in the United States include society’s marginalized populations such as the LGBTQ community, injection drug users, and minorities. In the early stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, youth activists were at the forefront in pressing the FDA to approve drugs at a faster pace. Yet even with the release of the first HIV/AIDS drug, zidovudine, many still could not afford the drug’s cost of $10,000 or endure the drug’s vicious side effects in the late 1980s. Only in 1996, through tireless advocacy by AIDS activists, did affordable costs and long-term effective treatment with little side effects emerge with the use highly active antiretroviral therapy treatment.
Today, as exemplified by justifying and tolerating the appalling cost of hepatitis C drugs, we are still questioning whether saving lives is a worthwhile “bang for your buck” endeavor.
If health intervention and action is dependent on merely one discipline or field of study, the fruits of social justice and health equity can never be fully realized. What is “efficient” and “effective” must be clarified and challenged further by health economists and policymakers.
Unless we truly make the individual human experience and quality of life the utmost priority in global medicine, we have yet to achieve health equity for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We tend to romanticize and overemphasize beginnings and endings.
We celebrate the coming and going of new years, and memorize the opening lines of novels and the dying words of great men.
It’s a trend that persists regardless of creed or color: God declares himself “the beginning and the end” in the Book of Revelation—precisely the phrase the great Quranic exegete Ibn Kathir chose to title his history.
But to bring attention to matters seedier and decidedly less sanctified—there’s a new Congress in town. And it’s off to quite a beginning.
The Senate, under the new management of Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, began its session with Senate Bill 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would authorize TransCanada to build the controversial 1,200-mile tar sands oil pipeline.
The pipeline has been heralded, trumpeted, and drummed up by congressional Republicans as the salvific steel that will create thousands of jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
It’s a bit curious that infrastructure creation is so lionized by the GOP, while repeated attempts to stimulate the national economy by repairing our decrepit and decaying public infrastructure are repeatedly spurned—though the $1 million TransCanada spent last year on lobbying may have something to do with that.
Of course, oil pipelines are necessary in the modern age where fossil fuels make up more than 80 percent of our energy. And provided that the plan is studied, and the necessary precautions against spills are taken, nothing would be amiss with the pipeline’s approval.
But the purpose of the bill is to circumvent that process entirely—and all for such measly gains.
The final draft of the State Departments’ Environmental Impact Statement for the project estimates that the project would, in fairness, create 42,100 jobs during the pipeline’s two-year construction period. But once the project enters service, only 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors would be needed. All this fuss for such a small omelette?
The report also estimates that the project will inject $3.4 billion into the economy, which isn’t nothing, but it’s also .02 percent of last year’s GDP. And contra claims of American energy independence, which aren’t going to appeal to people when gas prices are at such lows, the report estimates that the construction of the pipeline won’t have much of an effect on the markets.
The Environmental Protection Agency has also cautioned that the oil sands transported by the pipeline could add as much as 935 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 50 years. In terms of yearly emissions, that’s like adding another Maine to the nation.
But there are silver linings to this most auspicious of senatorial openings. An amendment to the Keystone bill “to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax” passed 98-1, with only Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, voting against it. Even Senator Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and wrote the book “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,” voted for it.
But curb your enthusiasm: A stronger worded amendment suggesting that human activity significantly contributed to global warming was defeated 50-49. Basic mathematical majorities should command the chamber—no matter who’s in charge. That the counterintuitive phrase “defeated 50-49” just had to be written is another sign that we still have a ways to go. And don’t forget that—should the bill pass Congress—the likely veto it faces just makes all of the above a longwinded excuse in futility.
Alas, all this still makes for a better opening than the House had, where the first order of business was passing a sure-to-be-vetoed (and almost certainly unconstitutional) bill that would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, that wouldn’t include exceptions for rape unless they had been previously reported. The bill was later scrapped after a last-minute revolt by the party’s female members.
That was the beginning. And here’s to the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During winter break, students received a look from University officials at the preliminary plans for the renovation of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center.  Intended as a central, socializing space for students, the Campus Center is a positive initiative that has the potential to improve student life. The plans for this center have, however, come under scrutiny in the past for ignoring student input, and going forward, the planners should make every effort to stay attuned to students’ desires for the project.
President Faust and the working groups involved in this project have made strong efforts to design the new campus center to be a social and vibrant space worthy of the Common Spaces program, which also spearheaded the Science Center Plaza and Memorial Church porch renovations. Meeting rooms, lounge spaces, restaurants, and cute touches like indoor trees that reflect the seasons should fulfill student wishes for comfortable meeting areas and student services. Also worth mentioning are plans for the center to be open 24 hours a day, and endeavors to attend to specific student wishes like lockers, which students at Harvard’s Longwood campus and College students living in the Quad have requested.
These efforts to incorporate individual student feedback are commendable, but the campus center should keep larger-scale student recommendations in mind as well, lest it fail like Loker Commons, a past attempt at creating a common space for students. Notably, the Undergraduate Council’s request in 2011 for an undergraduate student center will not come to fruition in the Smith Campus Center, which will be designed to accommodate all of the University’s schools, faculty and alumni, as well as tourists in some locations.
While President Faust aims for this to be a part of her “one University” goal for Harvard’s capital campaign, undergraduate leaders worry that such a broad audience will have disparate needs and deter undergraduates from using the communal space. Those in charge of the Smith Campus Center’s design need to be mindful of The Queen’s Head Pub, which members of the campus center’s undergraduate working group have cited as a failed example of a space intended for both graduate and undergraduate students.
This working group represents the best vehicle through which undergraduates can influence plans for the center. Created to help establish College priorities for the Campus Center, its members must make sure that they continue to communicate undergraduate concerns effectively as the project gets underway. For their part, university planners must make clear that they continue to value student feedback.
When the Smith Campus Center opens in 2018, it may very well become an invaluable part of life for Harvard undergraduates. While the current plans are promising, more attention to student ideas will ensure that the Center fulfills this intended purpose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 28, 2015, at 10:39 p.m.
For the first time since 2004, Harvard outraised Stanford in Fiscal Year 2014, posting a record-breaking total of $1.16 billion in gifts, according to a survey by the Council for Aid to Education. Stanford raised $928 million, according to the school’s annual financial report.
“We’re doing very well and we’re very pleased,” said Susan L. Graham '64, a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
The announcement of the historic total comes in the first public year of Harvard’s capital campaign, which launched in September 2013 and aims to raise $6.5 billion. That total would be the largest fundraising effort by an institution of higher learning, exceeding Stanford’s $6.2 billion campaign, which concluded in 2011.
In FY 2012, Stanford became the first institution of higher learning to receive over $1 billion in gifts in a single year, bringing in $1.035 billion. Harvard’s historic year marks only the second time that a university has eclipsed the billion dollar benchmark in one year, raising the most money in a year by any school ever.
“Our alumni and friends have been extraordinarily generous with their time and resources from the moment The Harvard Campaign began,” Tamara E. Rogers ’74, Harvard’s vice president for alumni affairs and development, wrote in an emailed statement. “The volunteerism and support from around the globe will make a difference for generations to come.”
While the amount is the most raised by a university, it remains unclear what the number means internally at Harvard, according to Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
“[University] President [Drew G.] Faust is going to say that this is a phenomenal start to the campaign,” he said. “Whether that is true...is only something she and the people with the internal benchmarks will ever know.”
Harvard raised 45.9 percent more in 2014 than in 2013, the survey reported. The largest gift to the University in the FY 2014 cycle was $30 million. The record year does not include Harvard’s largest-ever pledge of $350 million made by Gerald L. Chan to the School of Public Health, which was announced last September.
While some see Harvard and Stanford as yearly competitors for the top spot on fundraising and endowment lists, Ann E. Kaplan, the director of CAE’s survey, pushed back against the notion of an arms race between the two universities.
“It doesn’t matter who’s number one and who’s second—they both raise so much money and have programs that merit so much support,” she said. “I don’t think [Harvard’s] reason for setting higher goals is to be better than Stanford.”
Hess, however, said he was “less surprised” by Harvard’s record year. In previous capital campaigns, Harvard has tended to out-fundraise the competition.
“Between inflation and the escalating effectiveness with which these elite institutions are pursuing these gifts, it’s a record I had expected to be broken,” Hess said.
Still, Harvard supporters see the news as an indication of the capital campaign’s strength and impact.
“It is by supporting the work of Harvard’s remarkable faculty and students that the campaign will have its greatest impact,” University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 wrote in an email.

Mather House has designated resident tutor Jason B. Munster ’07 to serve as the House’s inaugural first-generation tutor, formalizing an advisory role that other tutors across the College have also played to address concerns of first-generation college students.
Tutors who live and advise students in the Houses generally specialize in subjects, ranging from race relations to pre-law. Mather created the new first-generation tutor designation, according to Munster, after he had several conversations with other tutors and House Masters Christie McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten.
Munster, who was a first-generation college student, said he first approached Mather’s House masters about creating the new role because he thought it was a necessary resource for first-generation students at Harvard. Munster  is involved with the Harvard First Generation Alumni group.
While he acknowledged that some tutors have already been supporting the College’s first-generation students, Munster said the new role identifies a point person for first-generation students to speak to about concerns unique to them.
“Someone whose parents didn’t go to college have a very different experience to someone whose parents did,” Munster said.
Anthony A. Jack, a race relations tutor in Mather who has conducted research on first-generation college students, agreed that the designation would be helpful. Jack said that concerns from first-generation students in Mather have “disproportionately” been addressed by race relations and minority tutors in the House.
Still, some tutors have worked previously to address this issue, Jack said, including a coalition of tutors in the Quad who emailed Quad residents identifying themselves as first-generation college students and offering to serve as resources.
Jack and Munster said they hope that all Houses will eventually designate their own “first-gen” tutors. Munster plans to work with the Harvard College First Generation Student Union and the Harvard First Generation Alumni group to mentor first-generation students at the College.
Ana M. Barros ’16, president of the First Generation Student Union, praised the new tutor role in an email, writing that “this is a great step to creating a more inclusive environment in the Houses.”
Tutors with some specific designations receive training and additional resources from the College. While Munster said he does not currently receive extra resources, McDonald said House administrators would discuss the issue in the future.
“Because we’re just at the start of this, we’ll have to see,” she said.

Harvard Medical School will launch a new Department of Biomedical Informatics on July 1, according to HMS Dean Jeffrey S. Flier.
The new department will build on a center in biomedical informatics which was established in 2005, according to a letter from Flier to HMS affiliates this month.
HMS professor Isaac S. Kohane, co-director of the current Center for Biomedical Informatics, will serve as the inaugural chair of the new department, which will launch along with five core faculty members currently associated with the center. The new department will apply quantitative methods and software to biological data and officially open in the Longwood Medical Area in July.
According to Kohane, the new department will be at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and the life sciences and will aim to re-imagine a more quantitative approach to medical decision-making, revolutionize the patient-physician encounter, and create a comprehensive information database to aid physicians in providing care.
Kohane said that the focus of biomedical informatics on analyzing large datasets across many individuals allows for more personalized care that reaches beyond the mind of one doctor, comparing the ideal care model to the data prediction systems widely used by consumer websites.
“When you go to Amazon or Netflix, because they have seen literally thousands of people with similar preferences and histories to you, they are able to predict with a certain amount of accuracy what you’re going to buy, the next movie you’re going to see,” Kohane said. “In medicine, [doctors alone] don’t have in their head other patients like you and they won’t have a very data-driven sense of what your next move clinically is, so they’re flying more blindly.”
Kohane acknowledged concerns about patient privacy and ownership of data, pointing to the necessity of creating ways to respect patient autonomy while still fulfilling research goals.
Plans for the department have been in the works since as early as 2009, with negotiations prolonged partly due to the the field being seen as unconventional, according to Kohane.
“We don’t look like a standard department,” Kohane said. “We’re not disease-based. We’re not discipline-based. That’s not a conventional fit for the existing basic science departments, and it’s not a fit for communications departments… [Our faculty members] are part of physics departments and computer science departments [who] wanted to be more involved in some of the more biological questions.”
The department has also gained acclaim outside of the Harvard sphere. Russ B. Altman, director of the biomedical informatics program at Stanford, threw his support behind the project.
“This is important for Harvard because it has had somewhat distributed excellence in this field, and the opportunity to integrate the strengths will be important for building the future educational and research programs that are needed,” Altman said. “It is important more generally because Harvard is adding itself to the list of places that have made substantial commitments to biomedical informatics.”
HMS affiliates have also welcomed the launch of the new department, citing the potential developments it will pursue.
“I don’t see how you can have the next breakthroughs without informatics being front and center and it being at the core,” said Alexa T. McCray, co-director of CBMI and HMS associate professor.

Harvard genomics researchers could see increased funding for their work should Congress approve a White House proposal to allocate millions more dollars to the research of medical treatments personalized to a patient’s genetic information.
Funding for the research would come from the National Institutes of Health, the University's largest federal sponsor for research, which accounts for about half of Harvard’s federal sponsorship.
Specifics for the proposal—first announced during President Obama’s State of the Union address last week—will not be made public until the release of Obama’s 2016 budget in early February. Still, Harvard professors said that a growing group of the University’s researchers who are focused on applying troves of genetic data to clinical strategies would especially benefit from the increase in funds.
Despite years of progress in the field of genomics, federal funding for related research has been scarce, according to Medical School associate professor Heidi L. Rehm.
“The federal government has been supportive of genomics-based healthcare, but with few dollars,” Rehm said. “So this is encouraging.”
But although new funding from the NIH would benefit genomics research, Medical School associate professor Patrick T. Ellinor said that small grants from other sponsors ensure that projects are sufficiently funded.
“For all medical researchers, NIH is the backbone for funding, but it is not something you can survive on,” Ellinor said.
Some researchers also pointed to the concern that an NIH initiative for large-scale genomics research could restrict opportunities for smaller grants, a common refrain after the announcement of large health initiatives but more acute in this case because genomic research studies tend to be larger and more expensive.
In the long term, though, big initiatives often lead to more small grants as “leaps in understanding are made,” said former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, a stem cell and regenerative biology professor.
Despite talk of how funding might affect research at Harvard, it is still unclear how the new NIH proposal would be funded.
The program could be financed through new funds, but might also be funded by redistributing money away from existing NIH programs in order to sponsor research on genetically-tailored medical treatments, said Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Public Affairs and Communications.
“It will be important to understand how those funds are available,” Casey said. “[Will it come] at the expense at other programs in NIH and affect other peoples’ priorities?”
The proposal comes nearly two years after the federal government enacted broad budget cuts collectively known as sequestration, which cut research funding for universities across the nation. Federal funding for Harvard research fell by five percent to $608 million in the University’s fiscal year 2014, the first full Harvard fiscal year after the sequester was put into place.
NIH funding decreased 7 percent from fiscal year 2013, and the institution is experiencing “historical lows in terms of the amount of grants it can fund,” only sponsoring about 17 percent of all grants it receives, according to Casey.

At the first event in a series titled “The Health of Democracy,” Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, and Charles M. Sennott, co-founder of GlobalPost, said that the field of journalism is “under attack,” both from increasing digitalization and from physical threats against reporters and cartoonists.
Held Wednesday night at First Parish Church by the Cambridge Forum, “The Role of the Media” event drew a generally older crowd of graduate students, fellows, and local residents.
With the increasingly online nature of news, Jones said that “we are now at our own Gutenberg moment,” referring to the Gutenberg printing press that revolutionized information exchange in early modern Europe. While Jones acknowledged that the internet enables better communication and access to information, thereby lowering “the threshold for citizen engagement,”  he also raised concerns about it diluting the quality and accuracy of the reporting.
Jones added that the current state of journalism has led the world toward two extremes—one where everything can be said by publishing it online and one where nothing can be said, referencing the death of journalist James Foley, an American freelance contributor to GlobalPost killed by ISIS in August 2014, and the shooting at the office of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that killed 12 people.
“Digital technology has made possible a world in which there are a lot of people who are having to try to figure out where they stand when it comes to a tolerance and a willingness to accept bad information...about themselves, in exchange for the right to be able to speak freely themselves,” he said.
Sennott also asked Jones about the responsibility of individuals such as Julian P. Assange and Edward J. Snowden on government-implicating data leaks.
While Jones said he believed “there are secrets that should be kept,” he also noted that “nothing Snowden has put out there has put anyone’s life in danger.” Jones called Snowden’s actions “illegal but not immoral.”
“If we look at democracy, we are going to have to find a way to find that compromising spot that allows as much free speech as we can tolerate, but also puts some limits on free speech,” Jones said.
On the future of journalism and the need for informed citizens, Jones said that excess of information and easy access to it via the internet could be perilous.
“The real problem is not that there is a dearth of information,” Jones said. “It’s that there are so many distractions that people are not bothered with news, and that is not the way citizenship works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two new phone applications geared towards Harvard undergraduates and a gender equality campaign are among the Undergraduate Council initiatives planned for the spring semester, according to UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16.
In an interview Wednesday, the newly-elected pair said that their term will focus on creating more attainable and sustainable services for the student body and relying less heavily on administrators, in what they see as a contrast from their predecessors former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15.
“A lot of the work that we’re trying to do does not require constant dealing [with administrators],” Goyal said. “They’re very supportive of what we’re doing, and we’re very grateful for that, but we’re not entirely dependent on them. In that sense, getting projects done is something we’re more confident about.”
“We genuinely believe that a lot of the work that we’re trying to do, are deliverables that the student body can use for the next five or ten years,” he added.
The planned app package, which is set to launch later this spring, is one such “deliverable.” According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, the package will include a calendar app of Harvard events and an additional app with tools tailored for daily student life.
The pair ran last November on a platform set to address a “fear of missing out” among undergraduates, and said on Wednesday that they hope the calendar app will allow all students to attend a spectrum of events, regardless of whether or not they belong to the hosting organization. The app is set to include filters for House-specific events and events with free food, as well as an upvote system so that more popular events receive priority on the app.
“In the past, calendars were either not comprehensive or not customizable,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “You would see every event, and now with this, you can filter things.”
In tandem with the calendar, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal are looking to revamp the current Harvard smartphone app, which they regard as confusing and content-heavy.
“The Harvard app is overpopulated right now, so it’s not necessarily the most easy thing to navigate,” Nasrollahzadeh said. “We’ve put together specific items that we think are most relevant to the daily life of an undergrad. This includes not only a shuttle tracker, but a tool to call van services when you need them.”
The UC also plans to go public with an extension of HeForShe, a United Nations campaign which aims to bring male voices into the discussion of gender empowerment and equality. In affiliation with the campaign, the UC is planning a celebrity forum and other spinoff events.
“This will be the first time the UC is doing a big conference.” Nasrollahzadeh said. “We’re also hoping to do this in collaboration with other student groups.”
Addressing the lack of gender diversity within the Council itself, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said that they plan to increase the influence of the gender inclusivity position on the Council’s Student Life Committee.

Snapchat darkened an already stormy Tuesday by rolling out a new update and shattering our trust in the app…seriously, is C’est Bon the only thing we can count on anymore?
Here is what you should know about the update:
The new Snapchat is not optimal for stalking. No longer can you scroll through your whole friends list, pausing to check out who everyone’s best friends are (a very revealing activity), and their snap score. This feature was not only a great time waster, but also a low key way to keep tabs on others. Also, it definitely created added pressure to snapchat (or not to snapchat) certain people.
While the above might have seemed the most significant change, the Snapchat update was supposed to be about the new Discover feature. Media and entertainment companies like CNN, ESPN, Cosmopolitan, and Yahoo News have what is basically a more complicated version of Snapchat stories, with articles and video links for you to click through. It’s hard to imagine why anyone would turn to Snapchat in order to keep up with world news and celebrity gossip, but we’ll see. It was difficult to navigate, so I ended up stuck on a CNN interview with a man who once dropped acid with Steve Jobs.
