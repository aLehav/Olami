After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the imbecilic New-Age misappropriations of ancient indigenous prophecies are to be believed, then this is no ordinary day. That's right, folks: the world is ending today, and here on the Arts blog, we're going out in style. Here are seven distinct musical visions of the apocalypse, so give 'em a listen and choose your own grand finale.
1. Mozart—Requiem—"Dies Irae"
No setting of the Latin Requiem Mass is complete without the "Dies Irae" ("Day of Wrath"), a terrifying portrayal of the Day of Judgment as described in the book of Revelation. Mozart's setting of the hymn is as good as it gets for artistic evocations of the Christian imagining of the end.
2. Robert Johnson—"If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day"
The bleak voice and visionary guitar playing of Robert Johnson holds a special place among the occult legends of Delta blues. Johnson is reputed to have sold his soul to the devil, and in this song the divine power to end the world is invoked to express his wrath at an unfaithful lover.
3. Tom Lehrer—"We Will All Go Together When We Go"
Also known as Thomas A. Lehrer '47, this hugely underappreciated son of Harvard is arguably the most brilliant musical satirist in American history (not to mention a notable mathematician). This cheery tune, dating to the most nervous years of the Cold War, confronts the horrifying possibility of nuclear annihilation with razor-sharp farcical enthusiasm: "universal bereavement—an inspiring achievement!"
4. Jimi Hendrix—"1983 (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)"
In a particularly LSD-influenced vision of the apocalypse, Hendrix audaciously orchestrates a mystical retreat into the sea in the aftermath of a global war. The video's sonic landscape composed of dreamy underwater effects should be conducive to the "revolution in consciousness" advocated by some of the New Age theoreticians.
5. Richard Wagner—Götterdämmerung (The Twilight of the Gods)—Final scene
In the fantastically cataclysmic finale of Wagner's Ring Cycle, the hall of the gods burns in the sky, signaling the rebirth of the world. The most impossible stage directions in the history of theatre include onstage fire and flood; the score proclaims redemption as the world is cleansed of its curse.
6. Talking Heads—"(Nothing But) Flowers"
Exploring the question of what happens after the downfall of human civilization, this hilariously upbeat jam evokes the lushness of a new Garden of Eden—and a speaker who longs instead to go back to "honky tonks, Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens."
7. The Beatles—"A Day in the Life"
The list of things we'll all remember about today (if, in fact, we make it through) is more likely to be populated by normal activities than any of the disasters listed above. But this song, the crowning moment of the Beatles' crowning album, nonetheless elevates the quotidian existence, half boring and half incomprehensible, to a majestic cosmic significance. The humming cacophony of instruments builds and builds to the breaking point, as if to portray each individual's private apocalypse—only to finish on an endlessly resonant E major chord.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
President  Barack Obama on Friday nominated Massachusetts U.S. Senator John F.  Kerry to serve as Secretary of State during the president’s second term  in office.
 
If confirmed,  Kerry will replace outgoing Secretary Hillary R. Clinton and resign his  senior U.S. Senate seat, triggering a special election in Massachusetts  by as early as this summer. In the event of Kerry’s confirmation,  Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will appoint a temporary replacement to  represent the state in the Senate until an election is held.
 
While  major media outlets reported last weekend that the president had  settled on Kerry as his nominee, the White House delayed announcing  the selection until Friday. Some have speculated that this delay was due to the school shooting tragedy in Newtown,  Conn., as well as uncertainty surrounding other cabinet vacancies.
 
After  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan E. Rice withdrew her name  from consideration last week, Kerry became the obvious frontrunner for  the post. 
 
As a senator,  Kerry has traveled frequently as an envoy for the president, most  notably to danger zones in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Additionally, Kerry  chairs the influential Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
 
Senators  from both parties have predicted that Kerry will be easily confirmed in the Senate.
 
Kerry’s  confirmation would mean yet another election in Massachusetts. In most  states, the governor appoints a replacement senator to serve the  remainder of the term. Following a 2004 change to Massachusetts state law, a vacant Senate post must be filled by  special election between 145 and 160 days after the seat is opened. Assuming that  Kerry takes office in early 2013, the special election would be held in  mid-June 2013.
 
Patrick,  who is a Democrat, would appoint a temporary senator in the interim. He  has indicated that he will follow the precedent he set in 2009 when,  after the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56, he appointed  veteran Kennedy aide Paul G. Kirk Jr. '60 to fill the seat on the  condition that Kirk not run in the special election.
 
Outgoing  U.S. Senator Scott Brown, who in his election night concession speech  declared that “defeat is only temporary,” appears poised to run again.  Last month he lost the seat he had won in a 2010 special election to  former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren. 
 
On  the Democratic side, three congressmen from local districts—Stephen F.  Lynch, Michael E. Capuano, and Edward J. Markey—have all expressed  interest in running, with Markey emerging as the early favorite for the  Democratic nomination. Also potentially in the fray is Edward M. Kennedy  Jr., the son of the late longtime U.S. Senator. 
 
Both  parties would hold primaries six weeks before the election.
 
This summer's special election would be the second special election in Massachusetts in three years, as well as the third statewide election in that time. Brown, who ran in Senate elections in both 2010 and 2012, is expected to be the clear frontrunner if he runs again this summer, according to Republican political strategist Todd Domke. Brown has cash leftover from the costly November election, a campaign  team and strategy in place, and high favorability ratings in the state.
 
Domke  said he thinks a potential Brown campaign could begin running  advertisements as early as February.
 
Warren,  who will become the Massachusetts senior U.S. Senator as a freshman in  Congress, congratulated Kerry on Tuesday, but made no mention of Brown  or the now likely special election.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Dec. 23
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that outgoing U.S. Senator Scott Brown ran in three elections in Massachusetts in the past three years. In fact, Brown ran in two Senate elections in the state during that time and is expected to compete in a third.

Siyani Chambers’ rookie season keeps on getting better.
On Thursday, the freshman was named a candidate for the prestigious Bob Cousy Award, given annually to the best point guard in the country, by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
Chambers is one of just four freshman to be nominated for the honor, including Oklahoma State’s Marcus Smart, who entered the season as the nation’s top guard prospect, according to ESPN.
Chambers, in contrast, was ranked the 45th-best incoming floor general by ESPN. But he has not played that way thus far this year.
Through nine games, the freshman has emerged as the Crimson’s second leading scorer, averaging 12.6 points per contest while shooting nearly 50 percent from behind the arc. Chambers also leads the Ancient Eight with 5.1 assists per game and a 94.4 percent free-throw percentage; the latter number is fifth-best in the country.
"What can you say about Siyani?" Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said last Tuesday. "He's been the heart and soul for us this year."
It is the leadership that Chambers has provided filling in for departed former co-captain Brandyn Curry that has been especially important on his young team.
Despite playing 37 minutes a night—16th most in the nation—Chambers has been at his best late in games, most recently in the team’s 65-64 victory over Terriers, when he hit a game-winning jumper with five seconds to go.
For his performance against BU, Chambers won his second Ivy League Rookie of the Week award. Now, he’s a nominee for a much larger piece of hardware.
The initial list of 80 Cousy nominees will be narrowed down to 20, 10, and then a final five by March 1, after which the award will be determined by a selection committee.
Chambers is one of two Ivy League point guards to earn a Cousy nomination, along with Columbia’s Brian Barbour. Both are looking to become the first player from the conference to reach the award’s next stage since Jeremy Lin ’10 made the Top 11 three years ago.
“The Hall of Fame is proud to continue its mission with Mr. Cousy to celebrate and honor the top collegiate point guards in the country,” John L. Doleva, President and CEO of the Basketball Hall of Fame, said in a statement. “This list represents a large range of college basketball's top student athletes from across the country. We are excited to recognize these players for their continuous hard work and dedication.”
