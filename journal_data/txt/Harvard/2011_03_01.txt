After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Isabel Q. Carey ’12 is the president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) and a junior History of Science concentrator in Leverett House. She has been involved in an on-campus production every semester that she’s been at Harvard. As a member of the HRDC executive board, she also oversees more than 10 shows per semester.
The Harvard Crimson: What is your theater background?
Isabel Carey: I think the first time I did theater was in second grade, when I played a chicken in a production of my after school program. I’ve never done professional theater, but I always did theater wherever I was, both after school and locally. I did every show that my high school put on, and I’ve done a show every semester I’ve been here. I also do a bit of improvisation; I’ve always performed.
THC: What shows are you involved in this semester?
IC: The only show that I’m acting in is “Faustus.” The director is doing an adaptation of the Christopher Marlowe version. I get to play Mephistopheles, who is traditionally a male devil. Now he’s still a devil, just not a male anymore. Also, I’m production advising two or three other shows.
THC: What is your favorite production that you’ve done at Harvard?
IC: If I had to pick one, I would pick “The Pillowman,” which is a very dark comedy that went up in [the Loeb Experimental Theater] last spring. In that, I played a mentally retarded child-killer who was also a child-like figure herself. The role demanded a lot, in terms of physical and vocal transformation.
THC: Did you research to prepare for this role in “The Pillowman?”
IC: I’ve always worked just from the text. I’ve never researched for anything, really. The thing about a role like that is that it doesn’t specify how [the character] is mentally retarded. I didn’t have to portray a certain disease so instead, it was taking the text and situation given and trying to come up with vocal affectation and physicality that made sense with my body for the text.
THC: What is your favorite kind of role to play?
IC: I do like doing musicals, but perhaps that’s only because I was never cast as leads in musicals that I did in high school. “Grease” was the only musical in which I had a big role, and I adored that. I’ve been taking voice lessons with a really wonderful teacher for the last few years, so I’ve gotten a lot better than I was in high school, which is good for everyone involved.
THC: What do you love most about acting?
IC: I think my favorite thing about acting is being able to explore different people, which inevitably brings out sides of yourself, and really lets you explore the human psyche and how we interact with each other. When you’re acting, you can’t make yourself a different person by planning out every single second, that won’t be a real performance. It’s about finding a skeleton of a voice and a physical presence that you can bring life to in the moment onstage. In terms of production, I love the collaboration of theater. Theater can’t exist in isolation; it is the product of so many people coming together and contributing to these really extensive works.
THC: Do you spend your summers acting, or do you do internships unrelated to the arts?
IC: Last year I went to London and interned at a black box theater called “The Gate” with a summer fellowship from the Harvard-Cambridge Scholarship program. The theater allowed me to significantly contribute to the work they were doing. I got to learn about all aspects of running this small experimental theater company. Because I had all this wonderful grant money, I was able to eat. I felt most deeply grateful for my funding when I realized that with my fellowship money, I was making more than other staff members were making per week. There is truly no money in the arts.
THC: What did you learn in London that you’ve brought back and applied here at Harvard?
IC: I think what stuck with me most was the ability of my co-workers to do so much with so little. There’s not a lot of them, and they are running a very legitimate theater out of a small space above a pub. They have no money, yet they continue to produce incredible work. I took away an appreciation for their efficiency and drive, which I’m trying to apply to the work I do at HRDC.

Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Chris E. Gummerson ’12
Produced by Katie R. McNicol ’12 & Brenda Lin ’12
“What would you do if you could go anywhere or do anything?” Chris E. Gummerson ’12 asks in her new play, “Inside Out.” To Charlie Hart, played by Philip M. Gillen ’13, the answer is simple: go to Alaska.
Gummerson explains, “Charlie works at a major cell phone company, and the show follows him as he gets fed up with the noise of it all and [it] leads to this adventure to the wilderness of Alaska.” While “Into the Wild” comparisons may seem inevitable, the parallels end with the premise. This play, according to Gummerson, has a decidedly “fun and light-hearted” take on the situation.
“Inside Out” is an original play, which Gummerson wrote earlier this year. As such, it deals with themes that are especially relevant to college students. “In a world where technology entirely controls all of our lives, it’s really great to see someone write a show this relatable,” said Valeriya Tsitron ’14, who stars as both Jillian, Charlie’s stressed-out co-worker, and the more impulsive Imogen.
Gillen brings the theme even closer to home for Harvard students: “Charlie is this guy who came out of college thinking this is what he’s supposed to do, this is what’s going to make him happy. He realizes it’s not working out, and this is not what he wanted; there is this whole world out there that he is totally unaware of. It is a predicament that is very relevant to Harvard students, and the sweet thing is that he actually decides to go out and do something that might make him happy.”
The show also plans to integrate creative lighting and sound design into the black-box space of the Loeb Experimental Theater. Stage manager Brad M. McMullen ’12 is especially excited about the ability to “create an aurora borealis and to turn a subway into a submarine”—though what exactly that entails he is saving as a surprise for audiences.
McMullen stressed that the message of the play was to “appreciate the stuff that’s around you, and don’t get caught up in the day to day grind of things.” Gummerson also expressed hope that students would embrace this theme in a very specific sense, as in take the time to appreciate “Inside Out.”

Cabot House Junior Common Room
Directed by Meryl H. Federman ’11
Produced by Wendy Y. X. Chen ’12, Arthur D. Kaynor ’12 & Felice S. Ford ’11
“Oedipus Rex,” Sophocles’ tragic tale of a king who unknowingly murders his father and sleeps with his mother, was written almost two and a half millennia ago and features a story very much ingrained in the cultural canon. Nonetheless, the director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s new production of the play is confident that it remains relevant to our times, in ways that are often forgotten when the piece is staged today. “The play contains very personal stuff,” says director Meryl H. Federman ’11, “with common ideas that have sort of been lost over time.” Her goal with this production is to “take it out of the tight-buttoned classical sensibility, so it isn’t a toga and sandal rendition of the play” and modern audiences can more easily connect with the characters.
It may seem ironic that a production so intent on removing a “tight-buttoned classical sensibility,” is also a collaboration with the Harvard Classics Club. Luckily, the Classics Club appears in line with director Federman’s modern interpretation. Felice S. Ford ’11, a translator and producer for the production as well as a member of the Classics Club, says that “the Classical Club’s philosophy with this work is to provide for a modern audience as authentic a view of the classical play that we are working on as possible. We are trying to bring out a lot of the aspects crucial to understanding what Greek tragedy was and how it was performed.”
Eli E. Kahn ’13, who plays Oedipus, praises the work of the Classical Club translators. “There’s a lot of modern language. It’s less oppressively formal,” he says. Another aspect of the production’s attempt to modernize the piece involves updating the visual aesthetic. “The director is going for ... a frontier, American post-revolutionary type of feel,” says Ford.  “There’s a sort of wildness to it,” adds Federman.
The goal of these changes is to make the play’s central theme of fate and free will more relatable. “Just because these stores are about gods and heroes, [it doesn’t mean you] have to be a god or hero to have this story be accessible to you. The themes are deeply personal to us all,” says Federman.

“I wish my life was important to someone …  that the sense that [life] is a series of random events would dissipate,” says The Girl in Purple (Georgia Lyman) in “The Hotel Nepenthe.” A series of random events would be a simple way to describe “Nepenthe,” the Actors’ Shakespeare Project’s new one-act drama directed by David R. Gammons, which plays at The Storefront on Elm Street until March 6. “Nepenthe” feels like a Haruki Murakami novel, surreal gems within mundane scenes; however, while the comedic aspects of the play are strong, the serious parts drag along, and only at the end is any satisfaction achieved.
Performed by four actors playing a total of seventeen characters, “The Hotel Nepenthe” shows a series of intimate interactions between disparate pairs of people: a Senator’s wife (Marianna Bassham) with a prostitute (Georgia Lyman); a slightly insane cab driver (Daniel Berger-Jones) with a hopped-up yuppie (John Kuntz); and a starlet (Lyman) with her one-night stand (Berger-Jones).  The stories are everyday occurrences each containing one twist. For example, a man stuck in the rain (Kuntz) hails a cab driver (Berger-Jones) whom he finds out stuffed the real cab driver in the trunk. These unsettling interactions are seemingly unrelated except for slightly sinister references to the titular hotel, where characters attempt suicide, die, drug and murder other characters, and, most notably, steal the hotel’s trademark leopard-print bathrobes.
The mood of “Nepenthe” is dark in parts as many of the characters contemplate the perceived meaninglessness of their lives. However, “Nepenthe” spends more time on comedy than tragedy. Each of the characters uses humor to lighten the mood of their scene. “I gave him vodka, Lunesta … and Sleepytime Tea,” says the Senator’s wife of her husband in a well-to-do East Coast accent. Bassham and Kuntz were standouts on the comedic front, sometimes carrying their scenes unassisted. However, while the comedy worked well, some of the dramatic scenes lagged. Many characters’ stories are harrowing, and Kuntz, also the playwright, effectively conveys the play’s central theme of existential angst, but the cast sometimes fails to do justice to the material. While Lyman has some of the most powerful lines in the show, it is hard to identify or feel sympathy with her characters. Perhaps because she is forced to juggle the emotional baggage of four different characters, several of them feel one-dimensional and emotionally drained.
A large portion of the blame for the play’s dramatic failures is due to the staging. The venue is a basement with chairs along the back and side walls opening onto a series of changing rooms. In many scenes, it is unclear who is actually a character and who is waiting to go onstage for the next scene, and when the action on stage grows less compelling it becomes easy to drift away and watch the other characters waiting in the wings.
Other technical elements, including the light and sound work, are more effective. The sound effects particularly are chilling—classical piano accompanies the final tying-together of the different plot threads, increasing the revelatory atmosphere of the scene. Sometimes the effects are a little too prominent, especially the jolting use of airhorns to get the audience’s attention, but overall sound design is one of the play’s stronger aspects.
Despite some flaws in the staging and dramatic execution, there are many redeeming moments. The beginning scene where Bassham and Berger-Jones—as the Rent-a-car gal and bellhop respectively—discuss a murder that occurred at the Hotel Nepenthe is one of these high points. The gradual movements between the two characters create a sense of fear, and the slow movements of the girl who was murdered walking across the stage (Lyman) make the scene downright eerie.
The final reveal of “Nepenthe” is worth the wait. It is akin to a Twilight Zone episode, with an ending that makes the viewers say “Ahhhh … Now I see it.” With all four actors finally on stage together, the sheer amount of energy in the air—accompanied by a fantastic light and sound sequence—makes you forget the occasional tediousness that came before. “Nepenthe” fulfills the Girl in Purple’s desire for the sense that life is a series of random events to dissipate, and it does so quite beautifully.

When talking to Topher Grace and Teresa Palmer in a dimmed lounge at Kings Bowling in Boston, MA, it’s easy to think that they’re the cool friends of your older siblings instead of two of Hollywood’s more memorable up-and-coming actors. The pair couldn’t seem more down-to-earth: Palmer walked in and immediately headed for the bowling lanes, and Grace shouted “TOGA!” at the circle of college students excited to interview him. But don’t let their lack of pretension fool you—the two young stars’ new film, “Take Me Home Tonight,” looks to be a career stepping-stone for both.
In the movie, Grace and Palmer play, respectively, Matt Franklin and Tori Frederking—a too-smart-for-his-own-good graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the girl he was in love with throughout high school. But this isn’t any ordinary contemporary romantic comedy; rather, “Take Me Home Tonight” doubles as a coming-of-age film set in 1988 Los Angeles.
Both stars are adamant that the film is not a spoof of the decade, but rather presents an honest portrayal of it. “We wanted [“Take Me Home Tonight”] to feel like it was a movie that was really made in the ’80s,” Palmer said. “Like we had put it away in a vault and pulled it out and brushed the dust off and we just pressed play. It feels vintage, and I think we managed to capture that.”
The actors related how the film’s crew went to extreme lengths to recreate such an iconic era—from partying to “Come on Eileen” in their free time to studying old yearbooks so as to capture the details of 1980s fashion. That said, however extravagant the movie’s period outfits were, costume designer Carol Oditz kept Teresa Palmer’s look beautifully timeless.
The Australian-born bombshell may not be a household name quite yet, but Palmer is working her way up the ladder. “It feels very surreal,” she said with a smile. “I really am trying to embrace the whole experience because there are so many peaks and valleys in this career, and right now it’s a peak but I know that there’s a valley that’s going to be coming shortly.”
Though downturns are inevitable in Hollywood, Palmer isn’t going anywhere for the time being. She has already worked alongside Nicolas Cage in “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” (dir. Jon Turteltaub) and beside Daniel Radcliffe in “December Boys” (dir. Rod Hardy), and she recently finished filming “I Am Number Four” (dir. D.J. Caruso). With “Take Me Home Tonight,” she can add to her repertoire of co-stars not only Grace, but also Anna Faris, Dan Fogler and Chris Pratt.
“I think it’s like, egotistical that ... [Faris] could be my twin,” Grace said frankly of the actress who plays his twin sister in the film. Mutual respect, he said, was a constant feeling around the movie’s set, even when the cast was scarfing down breakfast after shooting all night—a frequent occurrence, as the crew went nocturnal for around eight weeks to film the movie’s substantial nighttime footage. Grace was effusive about his fellow cast members. “These are going to be the biggest movie stars of five years from now, and I got to see them all together,” he said.
Grace, of course, is no small-time performer himself. He is best known for his role as Eric Forman on “That ’70s Show.” Earning his first producing credit, he came up with the idea for “Take Me Home Tonight” with longtime friend and fellow producer Gordon Kaywin. The two are credited with the story behind Jackie and Jeff Filgo’s screenplay.
Throughout the movie, Grace’s character runs around Los Angeles stealing cars and seeking hard drugs, as well as trying to impress the girl of his dreams. But while inhabiting a character is old hat for Grace, serving as executive producer was an entirely new experience. “I got to spend a lot of time with the director that you just don’t get as an actor,” he said. “I felt like I arrived with a real knowledge of everything about the film.” Adding to the sense of familiarity on set were Jackie and Jeff Filgo, the film’s writers, who met Grace years ago when the three collaborated on “That ’70s Show.” “They really know my voice, and they’re a pleasure to work with,” he said.
While it is never at a loss for comedy, “Take Me Home Tonight” aims to convey more poignant themes as well. When Grace and Palmer pondered the true message of the movie, the conclusion they came to speaks to their personal experience, as well that of many young people today: “It’s tough when structure ends,” Grace said. “Middle school then high school then college—then no more structure. It’s almost weirdly paralyzing that you have so many options.” The moral of the movie according to Grace? “Just roll with it, let go, and it’s okay not to know.”

Explosive diarrhea, comparative penis shots, a man masturbating in a parked car in front of his suburban dream house, and an entire family of Asian-Americans getting killed by a gangly British guy for comedic effect during the credits are all actual scenes that embody the raw, vulgar, raunchy, and racist in Bobby and Peter Farrelly’s latest film “Hall Pass.” Underneath a steady stream of demented gags, however, the Farrelly brothers offer an unsettling and often painfully hilarious exploration of the complications of early middle-age existence in contemporary suburban, middle-class America, as well as a critique of the associated social life.
The premise is simple. Two housewives, Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate), exasperated by their husbands’ “wandering eye[s]” and “obsession with sex,” take wisdom from the TV shrink Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar) and each offer their husbands a “hall pass:” “a week off from marriage to do whatever you want without consequences.”
The initial hesitation of husbands Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) quickly dissolves into adolescent glee. With their wives no longer in the picture, Rick and Fred thrill to visions of the younger chicks they’ll score over the next seven days. Of course, in the ensuing week, not much really happens, and instead of collecting conquests, the men find themselves weighed down with bloated stomachs and sad, wine-purpled lips. When they call it a night, it’s only 9:30 p.m.
Throughout this debauched adventure, the Farrelly brothers’ attention to detail evokes the New England suburban setting both admirably and disconcertingly. During the poker nights in Rick’s and Maggie’s impeccably generic dining room, the guys—in hats and playing with dollar bills—drink Newcastle beers and munch on Doritos; on the kitchen counter sit boxes of Cheez-Its for the kids. Rick wears pleated khakis and the resigned paunch of the uncool dad, while Fred sports an Enzyte Man hair part and cheesy grin that scream desperation. Likewise, starlets Fischer and Applegate both sparkle less under a layer of tiredness, aging, and social obligations. In this manner, “Hall Pass” is unexpectedly effective at conveying real-world aspects of middle America’s socio-cultural experience.
But lest one give “Hall Pass” too many points for perceptive maturity, the film’s portrayal of Asians leaves something to be desired. During a slapstick episode at a golf course, a passing group of Korean women golfers is casually referred to as “The Joy Luck Club.” Later, when Fred goes into a “Korean” massage parlor assuming that he can buy a hand-job, he accidentally kicks a small Asian toddler playing in the waiting room and demonstrates incredibly condescending behavior towards the receptionist. Fred does get his due—he is humiliated by the receptionist in front of the white, suburban patrons at the Korean dry-cleaners’ next door—but the film’s cultural stereotypes are nonetheless worrisome. Are the Farrelly brothers merely portraying and poking fun at racist attitudes towards Asians? Or are they exploiting the demographic for crass comedic and commercial gain?
For all its questionable content, though, “Hall Pass” is not without its moments of authenticity. At its most serious, the film illustrates the difficult transition into adulthood. Rick and Fred find themselves caught between the neurotic, self-absorbed, and self-entitled young adulthood embodied by madcap Brent (Derek Waters)—barista by day, club DJ and angry car vandalist by night—and the stiff and obnoxious suburban success of the preppy Long family down the block. Within this painful paradigm, their cringe-inducing exploits and pitiable personalities are more readily understood.
Thus, while “Hall Pass” undoubtedly contains reams of crude humor and vulgar jokes, these are employed as both a reflection and critique of current American culture. Put another way: the movie’s humor might be immature, but its usage isn’t. Indeed, by film’s end, as each character comes to recognize their own self-worth and the value of the life they have led, it seems almost as though the Farrelly brothers are themselves—alongside their characters—finally growing up.

Here’s a terrifying analogy: “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never – The Director’s Fan Cut” might just be this generation’s “Blade Runner.” But where the multiple versions of Ridley Scott’s sci-fi classic were spawned from creative differences between the director and the studio, the recut version of this documentary is a result of worryingly exploitative corporate greed. Though the original version of the film was released only two weeks prior, Paramount Pictures nonetheless fast-tracked an alternate version of the movie, replacing approximately one-third of it with new footage in the hopes of luring Beliebers back into theaters.
Make no mistake: “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never – The Director’s Fan Cut” is a marketing tool. It is not an intimate exposé of the life and explosive career of the teenage pop star. It is meant to make those that already love him want to love him even more, specifically—if the film’s own audience reaction shots are to be believed—females between the ages of eight and 18.
The film opens with a stereotypically endearing collection of clips from home movies that provide a glimpse into Justin’s upbringing—from his youthful aspiration to be a crossing guard to a naïve proclamation that houses cost $59. From there, we get a condensed retelling of how talent manager Scooter Braun discovered Bieber’s videos on YouTube. R&B legend Usher describes his first impression of the Biebs and recalls asking himself, “The boy has talent, star power, and he knows how to solve a Rubik’s Cube?”—thus redefining the term “triple threat” for the 21st century.
The film then introduces its supporting cast of talent agents, vocal coaches, and sound engineers. By some odd coincidence, every person interviewed frames their relation to Bieber in familial terms; Justin is their brother, nephew, cousin, great aunt, whatever. Of course, this intimacy somewhat undermines the notion that Bieber is out there in the wide world doing everything on his own and struggling to make it big, as the film would have viewers believe.
Life on the Bieber bandwagon certainly seems tough. As Chaz, a childhood friend of Justin and member of his teen entourage, confesses, “Facebook and stuff, I can’t even get friend requests anymore. I have too many.” Fortunately for viewers, the film’s musical content is a bit more compelling.
The backstage antics of the film are centered around Justin preparing for a series of sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden, and clips from these performances are sprinkled throughout the film. Joining Bieber on stage is a varied cast of performers past and present. Miley Cyrus collaborates with him on “Overboard,” while Jaden Smith—credited quasi-jokingly as a “Karate Expert”—helps out on the film’s title track, “Never Say Never.” There are also appearances by more seasoned stars: Ludacris shows up to drop his verse on the smash hit “Baby” and—oh, how the mighty have fallen—Boyz II Men sings backup on “U Smile.”
The concerts are well-shot, capturing the frenetic energy of the performances and the Beatlemania-esque sobbing of their entirely female audiences. In addition, the concerts were filmed in 3D; the technology doesn’t add anything explicitly interesting to the shot composition, but does add a nice amount of depth to Madison Square Garden’s expansive concert space.
While the film is, without a doubt, a two-hour-long puff piece, it is not without a little self-deprecation. A montage of the riotous insanity of the Cult of Beliebers winkingly presents the idol’s many tween female fans, whose grasp on reality seems to dwindle more and more as the movie progresses—one girl’s tank top reads “Madison Bieber.” Legendary music producer L.A. Reid describes his first impression of Bieber as “the Macaulay Culkin of music.” In another clip, upon being asked for a piece of shaving equipment, vocal coach Mama Jan quips, “a razor? Really?”
Despite the unshakable feeling of capitalism motivating the sheer existence of “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never – The Director’s Fan Cut,” it is tough to deny that the movie is, in actuality, pretty fun. Regardless of whether or not one sees his songs as competent music, it is incredibly difficult to deny that Justin Bieber has a presence—an intangible swagger and confidence that he exudes throughout the film. How many other 16-year-olds can sell out Madison Square Garden and hold their own alongside established artists like Usher and Ludacris? It is this winning bravado that is able to sustain the film and makes Bieber one of contemporary music’s most important pop personas.
But ultimately, the film’s faults lie in its choice to disingenuously feed the Bieber phenomenon for profit, rather than honestly portray it. If “Justin Bieber: Never Say Never – The Director’s Fan Cut” can be encapsulated into a single moment, it is this: as the film comes to a close, Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun defiantly states, “we like to stay the underdog.” Set against footage of a sold-out show at the Garden, the statement seems, at the very least, dishonest.

“Someone yelled, ‘jump!’ And if they hadn’t, it wouldn’t have occurred to me.” Jumping saved Steven Sater’s life, an intimate crowd learned in the Adams House Lower Common Room on Thursday, February 24. In a conversation and question-and-answer session with Ryan McKittrick, Dramaturg for the American Repertory Theatre (A.R.T.), Sater described the flames that engulfed his apartment when he was a sophomore at Washington University in St. Louis. He ran to his balcony to escape the blaze, but the glass from the French doors blasted towards him, setting fire to his bathrobe. He finally took off his robe and—with encouragement from an unknown bystander —jumped. He landed on the concrete, shattering or fracturing 14 vertebrae and breaking his arms and wrists.
Sater recounts the accident without an ounce of self-pity. Once a victim of trauma, now a Tony and Grammy Award-winning playwright and lyricist, he cites his hospital bed as the beginning of his career. “I taught myself Ancient Greek, while I lay there,” he said. Rehabilitating for months, Sater learned about Greek philosophy, culture, and literature, inspiring him to translate Frank Wedekind’s “Spring Awakening” from the original German and reinterpret it as a modern-day Greek tragedy. Sater’s visit was part of the “Learning from Performers” program organized by the Office for the Arts at Harvard. The program allows students to learn from artists of all professions through informal discussions and workshops. The event was co-sponsored by the A.R.T., which is staging Sater’s musical interpretation of “Prometheus Bound” at the OBERON beginning March 4.
Sater’s musical collaborator for “Prometheus Bound” is Serj Tankian, the Grammy Award-winning frontman of System of A Down. Sater is known for rebellious rock ballads, a ways removed from System of A Down’s heavy metal sound. When asked about the unusual combination, Sater explained, “I felt that from the beginning, that the Prometheus story required a real outcry of the spirit and a wail of pain. And rock music has always seemed to me like a kind of cry against the deaf heavens—which seems so appropriate to the Prometheus story. And Serj sets my lyrics in a way I’ve never heard before. He sets them as a real scream, anguish from the soul.”
When Sater translated Aeschylus’ original text about Prometheus, the Titan, he envisioned the production as a political piece. Drawing inspiration from the Iraq War, he explained that there is something fundamentally wrong with democracy when private interest begins to steer the course of justice. Sater’s passion about these issues was especially evident when he spoke about the Armenian genocide. Tankian, Sater’s musical partner, is an Armenian immigrant as well as political activist with a focus on social justice and close ties to human rights non-profit Amnesty International.
Amnesty is a partner of “Prometheus Bound,” with each week’s performances dedicated to a different prisoner of conscience—a term coined by Amnesty International to describe a non-violent person who is imprisoned for their beliefs. The story of “Prometheus Bound” interprets Prometheus as the first prisoner of conscience, withstanding the torture of a tyrant, Zeus, as punishment for revealing the god’s plan to eradicate humanity. Sater sees Prometheus as “a charismatic leader of a revolution, like José Martí or Che Guevara—one of those inspired heroes of the people.”
An active Buddhist, Sater is part of the Soka Gakkai movement, which seeks to contribute to peace, culture, and education for the happiness of humanity. When asked how Sater sees his art relating to that message, he explained that he views it “as a weapon for peace.” He described Prometheus as a messenger, explaining that as the giver of fire, language, and culture, Prometheus enabled mankind to better itself. The message of “Prometheus Bound” reflects this idea of art as social justice, which Sater so thoroughly supports.
Sater’s art attempts to communicate messages of peace and equality. In the wake of the Columbine tragedy, Sater used the sexuality and violence in “Spring Awakening” as a way to express that “we don’t listen to what young people are saying.” He does the same with the idea of Prometheus as a prisoner of conscience in “Prometheus Bound.” Sater believes that art can effectively convey these ideas.  “Art feeds and nurtures the spirit and enables us to recognize that there’s something larger than ourselves that is within ourselves,” he said. “That we are not bound by either the frame of our five-foot bodies or the contours of our mind, but there’s something we participate in as a common humanity—that we’re all connected to one another.”

Absurdist literature is at its best in works like those of Franz Kafka; his characters weave through bureaucratic mazes and grapple with harrowing transformations in themselves and others as if they are natural occurrences. Absurdity is everywhere in Kafka’s stories, but his characters rarely question the irrational things that happen to them.
Ida Hattemer-Higgins’ debut novel “The History of History” opens with a simple absurdist premise: young American expatriate Margaret Taub awakens alone in the woods outside Berlin wearing tattered men’s clothes and unable to recall the past several months of her life. As Margaret attempts to reconstruct her recent past, she begins to explore the country’s Nazi history and to identify personally with it—experiencing Germany’s past through a series of hallucinations, meetings with a blind doctor, and sympathetic late night readings of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.”  But while Kafka’s characters accept absurdity as part of the human condition, both Margaret and Hattemer-Higgins’ narrator seem constantly incredulous at the changes she undergoes. These incredulous remarks and digressions result in scattered plotlines and clunky prose, ridden with clichés.
Berlin would seem to be the perfect setting for an absurdist plot; over time, it has been the center of several empires, the hub of the Third Reich, and split by the Berlin Wall for three decades. It is a city accustomed to accepting irrational divisions as commonplace. But when Margaret leaves her apartment one morning to find that the façade of every building in Berlin has turned into living flesh, the narrator begs the reader to accept her twist. “Something occurred which might tax the reader’s imagination to believe,” Hattemer-Higgins writes, “but this thing that happened – it must be believed.” Such a blatant shift in the narrator’s tone, a sudden direct plea to the reader, is exactly the type of ploy that calls into question the merit of Hattemer-Higgins’ hallucinatory premise; by forcing her points, she undercuts their effectiveness.
Hattemer-Higgins’ prose seems to strive for plausibility and understanding. Margaret does not encounter other characters; the author seems to drop them into the prose, but never takes the time to fully integrate them into the story. “And then, by chance, a new person appeared,” the narrator begins an account of the brief meeting between Margaret and a Nazi officer who witnessed Hitler’s suicide. “[H]e walked into Margaret’s life, and it was the reality, rather than the unreality, that threw down the gauntlet this time. Berlin had yet another trick up its sleeve.” The narrator does not give this man the space to demonstrate his importance through a role in the story; it is painfully clear that Hattemer-Higgins’ relies on clichés to introduce him.
In her prose, cliché is a bulwark against the possibilities of ambiguity and imagination. As Margaret continues on her quest to reconstruct the past several months, the narrator never refrains from dictating how readers should respond. Allusions, metaphors, signifiers, and foreshadowing events are rarely left to interpretation. It is as if the novel can only proceed in one direction, and the narrator is content merely to push it down that predetermined path. It is not long before Hattemer-Higgins’ heavy-handed prose becomes the enemy of her suspense.
However, her talent is apparent when she abandons her attempts at surrealism. When she forgoes the buildings of flesh, the endless rope ladders hanging from the sky over Berlin, and the zombie-hawk phantom of Joseph Goebbels’ wife, Hattemer-Higgins stops forcing the storyline and allows it to develop on its own.
Hattemer-Higgins succeeds instead in her descriptions of everyday life and less obviously absurd events. In one instance, the ghost of a Holocaust victim explains a simple allegory to the reader at length, ensuring that its meaning is properly understood. She then poetically recalls her childhood travels in Switzerland. In these recollections, Hattemer-Higgins allows the pressured family dynamic to speak for itself, and does not try to interpret the events; her restraint lends the passage a subtlety that the novel lacks as a whole. Even Margaret’s memories, on which the narrator is generally all too willing to comment, are expressed smoothly when rid of their absurdist pretensions. Describing Margaret’s grandfather visiting her years earlier, the narrator writes, “Her mother fixed up the back bedroom for him, and he, in the wide guest bed, kept the venetian blinds almost opaque, the sounds of ambulance sirens circling up to the twelfth floor.” Here, Hattemer-Higgins renders the mundane melodic. She allows her prose to expand naturally and the reader to interpret freely.
When Margaret is finally able to retrieve the missing months of her life, Higgins begins to tell a coherent  story. Perhaps taking on the historical guilt of an entire country is too ambitious a feat. The cruelty of Nazi Germany is too broad for Hattemer-Higgins to encompass in her narrative. She is most incisive when she confines herself to the brief history of one woman, to Margaret’s acts of betrayal and personal guilt, and to the quotidian aspects of life.

“The least I can do,” famed primatologist Jane Goodall once said about her work with animals, “is speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves.” Benjamin Hale’s debut novel seems to have the same goal, with a twist—rather than speaking for the mute, Hale allows the mute to speak in his own words. Written as a sprawling memoir, the novel chronicles 25 years in the life of Bruno Littlemore, a talking chimpanzee—educated, artistic and a convicted murderer. He narrates his story from confinement, yet Hale’s intensely descriptive and ostentatious prose gives Bruno the only right he ever sought: humanity.
Researchers single out Bruno, born in the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Ill., for his uniquely human personality. He arrives at the University of Chicago to undergo years of exhibition and learning, all part of a series of experiments to test the limits of chimpanzee intelligence. He immediately falls in love with the young Dr. Lydia Littlemore, a unorthodox primatologist who questions conventional scientific methods and soon brings Bruno home with her. Raised by Lydia as an emotional replacement for her own stillborn son and dead husband, the two develop a deeply emotional, and eventually sexual, relationship.
When sudden tragedy forces Bruno to live independently, he continues to explore the human condition from the unique perspective of an outsider. Bruno’s descriptions range from shockingly crude to heartbreakingly honest. His raw memoir, as Hale imagines it, explores the overlooked but central aspects of humanity that people take for granted—and one infinitely curious ape cannot.
Hale’s descriptions of ape life brim with metaphors for the human condition. As Bruno recalls about his mother, “She was born in the ghetto, a zoo-child of zoo-parents.”  In contrast, his Zaire-born father knew the freedom of the wild before his forceful introduction to captivity. His father even uses violence as an outlet for the post-traumatic stress disorder he developed after witnessing his parents’ murder in Zaire.
Hale throws out obscure topics and descriptions that, in the context of another novel, would be pretentious and unnecessary. But presented from the point of view of a self-educated, reflective chimpanzee, allusions to the Westermarck effect and ruminations on the existential nature of consciousness force the reader to accept Bruno’s humanity.
As Bruno’s emotions and mental faculties grow more human-like with the years, his outside appearance comes to mirror his inner ‘evolution.’ He eventually loses all his hair and undergoes rhinoplasty to obtain a human nose. Even before his nose job, Bruno’s hairless appearance and loquaciousness fool a 14-year-old girl into believing that he is a midget with birth defects. Here, Hale is even able to include a scathing critique of modern suburbia and selfish parenting. When Bruno meets this young, privileged and angry child actor, he cannot help but compare her life to his. “Little Emily had been sold into entertainment,” Bruno reflects, “just as I had been sold into science.”
Hale’s incisive prose reaches its zenith in Bruno’s exploration of the world around him. In unpacking society’s notions of religion, the taboos of death and defecation, and the intricacies of language, the plot of the novel often plays second fiddle to the language. Bruno’s constant digressions—recollections of other events, or meditations on human nature—lend his character a distinctive voice that overpowers any possible confusion about plot or chronology.
Through Bruno’s consistent wonder at the gigantic, fascinating human world, Hale brilliantly unpacks the intricacies of life. The skill of reading, which Bruno only learns after years of cultural immersion and education, never fails to amaze him. Shocked by the “metaphysical acrobatics” that all literate humans perform daily, Bruno’s detailed descriptions of his own thought process enliven the act of reading, critically examining it in a way that novels usually do not.
Hale brilliantly deconstructs the way the brain perceives the printed word: symbols, images and sounds all fascinate Bruno. He defends this obsession, saying, “We do not demand that human memoirists first explain how they became capable of language before getting down to the business of telling their stories,” Yet, every aspect of Bruno’s entirely unique life demands explanation.
Hale never shies away from offensive language and concepts, from comically crude anecdotes to scathing criticism of religion. In his thorough description of Bruno’s life, he leaves out no aspect of ‘human’ existence. Bodily functions play an important role in Bruno’s memoir—his maturity at the time of his introduction to human society means that he remembers, with perfect clarity, exactly how he was bathroom-trained, and describes the process in graphic detail.  Bruno’s condescension toward religion, animal experimentation and organized science ensure that a broad swath of society is attacked by Hale’s prose. There is also the overriding issue of Bruno’s relationship with Lydia, which can be interpreted as bestiality, true love, or both.
Yet for all of its shock value, “The Evolution of Bruno Littlemore” also reflects beautifully on the meaning of existence and humanity. Bruno explores the terrible tragedy of the human condition, in which language, though it enlightens, also separates people from their animal natures. “We gain language and lose the amazement,” he explains, “and afterward yearn to have it back, while at the same time we are always using our words as sticks to beat back the terror that crouches always just behind us, in our past, in our bodies, in our delicate animal selves.”
Over the course of the novel, language, the last barrier between humans and the rest of the animal world, comes tumbling down. Pondering the relationship between humans and animals, Bruno concludes that, “if we think of the whole world as a prison, then there’s no such thing as a cage-free animal.” In his intelligent, poignant debut, Hale demonstrates that despite the artificial separations that people erect between themselves and the natural world, humans and animals share more than we think.

Just over 12 years ago, a British playwright named Sarah Kane was under treatment for depression at King’s College Hospital in London. On February 20, 1999, she committed suicide, hanging herself with a shoelace. Though she was only 28 years old and left behind a small body of work, totaling five plays and a short film, she was already considered one of the most important theatrical talents of her generation.
Her tumultuous four-year career began in 1995 with the premiere of her play “Blasted” at the Royal Court Theatre. A play that graphically depicted the horrors of war, the show sent a shockwave through London’s theater scene. Appalled by its stark, unapologetic portrayals of violence, rape, and cannibalism, critics excoriated it. It was infamously deemed a “disgusting feast of filth” by the Daily Mail.
Kane, who was only 23 years old at the time, unexpectedly found herself cast as the enfant terrible behind the “Blasted” controversy. Kane, however, seemed bemused by the amount of attention her play received. In an interview, she admitted, “I wasn’t at all aware that ‘Blasted’ would scandalize anyone.” To Kane, the play’s depiction of violence wasn’t about employing sensationalist shock tactics—she was merely trying to present the effects of war in an honest and straightforward manner.
The gap between her stated goals and her critical reception is a striking one; in many ways, it is not surprising that such controversies arose from writing so riddled with internal tensions. Her dialogue is terse and minimal, but the action onstage captures an audacious Jacobean penchant for brutality. Furthermore, Kane was deeply concerned with experimentation, pushing theatrical form further than any playwright since Beckett; her last play, “4.48 Psychosis” is essentially a stream of text and numbers with no characters or stage directions.
The sheer intensity of Kane’s vision as a playwright renders her work fundamentally polarizing. However, throughout her career she actively sought to escape her own reputation: in order to circumvent critical bias and undue fanfare, she wrote her fourth play, “Crave,” under the pseudonym Marie Kelvedon. Kane didn’t set out to shock the world, and she never asked to be blown out of proportion.
The more I read Kane’s plays, the more intimate and personal they seem. The gift of her writing is that—bleak as it may be at times—she transcribes honestly and openly what she sees in the world. “Blasted,” for instance, was the product of seeing a victim of Bosnian warfare on TV. She sought to capture the personal pain of that refugee by crafting a play that connected the large-scale devastation of warfare to more pedestrian acts of personal violence. This impulse defines Kane’s unique theatrical genius: she intertwines moments of sublime beauty and overwhelming terror with small, quotidian moments of empathy and pain that resonate just as forcefully. “Blasted” is a veritable onslaught of almost two hours of violence, but the most arresting moment of the play is its ending: a simple but earnest “thank you” from one character to another.
Her corpus inevitably invites hyperbolized readings; you either profoundly love her work or find it “disgusting.” Personally, I’m a staunch member of the former category. In terms of talent, I would rank her among Sophocles, William Shakespeare, and Anton Chekhov. These are effusive comparisons to make, but I hold them as creed.
And yet I recognize that it’s easy to canonize artists you love, particularly ones that have met tragic ends like Kane’s. Perhaps my instinct to idolize Kane betrays the nature of her project—it’s the same reduction critics made in denouncing her work. You can call her a shock artist or a saint, but it’s essentially the same fallacy. Both reactions fail to recognize the flesh-and-blood human behind these plays.
My relationship to Kane’s work is at a strange nexus at the moment. I’m two weeks away from starting rehearsals on a production of her 1997 play “Cleansed;” and since the anniversary of her death, I’ve been inclined to consider more carefully the actual human being behind the words of the play. An author with such a short, illustrious career and a tragic demise naturally provokes the human drive to mythologize, but Kane never wanted to be anything more than human—this was, in many ways, the defining struggle of her career, and “Cleansed” is a play about the fundamentally human impulse to love.
Moving forward, whether staging Kane or simply reading her, I think it’s crucial to avoid any degree of hyperbole. At the most basic level her body of work remains a deeply personal artifact; in reading Kane, we have to unearth the humanity behind her writing, the humanity neither her sensational death nor the sensational action of her plays could bury.

“I’m 57 but I could be seven years old / ’Cause I will never be able to / Comprehend the expansiveness of what I’ve just learned,” sings Lucinda Williams on her newest album, “Blessed.” Given the strength of “Blessed” and her decades of critical acclaim, it is impressive that Williams is able to sustain this sort of humility. Williams’s newest album is a testament to the power and diversity of her style. Simple in most regards, the album is a collection of 12 emotionally-charged tracks that swing from slow jazz ballads to upbeat country rock tunes. What she lacks in complexity, Williams easily makes up for in quality, and both the lyrics and delivery of her songs are extraordinary. While on a song-to-song basis “Blessed” lacks thematic cohesion, it ultimately emerges as a touching compilation of incredibly powerful pieces.
When taken as such a collection, “Blessed” astounds. The final track, “Kiss Like Your Kiss,” is introduced by pulsing instruments and an arpeggiated guitar line. Williams layers a soft voice and beautiful imagery on top of the gentle instrumentals: “There’ll never be a spring so perfect again / We’ll never see a yellow so rich / The grass will never be quite as green / And there’ll never be a kiss like your kiss.” Her voice often wavers or barely hits a note, but these imperfections suit the song perfectly, as do her understated lyrics. The song flows like a gentle waltz—a simple, delicate account of the beauty of being in love.
On album-opener “Buttercup” and “Seeing Black,” Williams shows her tougher side. Backed by distorted guitars and a solid drum beat, she sings about disillusionment—with love on “Buttercup,” and with life on “Seeing Black.” “When did you start seeing black? / Was it too much good you felt you lacked? / Was it too much weight riding on your back?” she sings on the latter. In both songs, Williams is joined in the chorus by well-executed harmonies, which add force to the already muscular songs. The overall result is a confident indifference. This feeling stands in powerful contrast to her slower tracks, in which she lays her emotions bare.
The strongest song on “Blessed” is in many ways the most out of place. While the album lacks strong thematic or tonal consistency, “Soldier’s Song” is an even sharper departure from the other tracks. The song tells the story of a soldier at war and his love interest, with Williams narrating in the first person as a soldier on a battlefield. The song’s lyrics alternate between describing the soldier’s life and his love’s radically different domestic life—a juxtaposition that highlights the absurd, inhumane nature of war: “I met my enemy today / Baby takes the little one out to play / Enemy shot two of my buddies down / Baby rides the little one on the merry-go-round.” Williams also leaves out names, referring only to “baby,” “buddies,” and “enemy,” making the song a general anthem of all soldiers, not just a specific one. “Soldier’s Song” is so emotionally effective that it is difficult to listen to, but only because its message is so touchingly conveyed.
Aside from its lyrics, the most impressive feature of “Blessed” is the degree to which Williams uses her voice as a flexible emotional—if imperfect—tool. In “Buttercup,” she sings almost lackadaisically, her raspy voice literally slurring through the words. On “Soldier’s Song,” she sounds weary and meek, her voice wavering, suggesting the pain of the soldier. Her voice is clear and light on “Blessed,” and the song is one of the happier tracks on the album as a result.
On “Copenhagen,” Williams alters the tone of her voice yet again, singing in a gentle yet raw voice lyrics that perfectly describe the album: “Walking through unfamiliar streets and / Shaking unfamiliar hands and / Hearing unfamiliar laughs / And lovely language I don’t understand.” While it may seem trite, this is exactly what “Blessed” is—a walk through the unfamiliar streets of Williams’s disparate experiences while hearing the language of her emotions—emotions conveyed so directly and poetically as to be both heartrending and heartwarming.

There’s a kind of adolescent ennui in some of Papercuts’ song titles—titles like “Chills” and “I’ll See You Later I Guess”—that’s unfortunately indicative of the mood of the entire album. “Fading Parade” is a release that seems designed to encourage listeners to project their own experiences onto its generic, somnambulant lyrics and bleached-out musical backdrops. However, there’s not enough energy or emotion in most of the songs to engage listeners to this degree, and the result is more exhaustion than the catharsis that the album seems desperate to produce.
The ambiguous and almost juvenile language captures the noncommittal sense of many of the songs—“Your things are on the floor / I’ll see you later, I guess.” The artist comes across as more of a washed-out relic of the psychedelics than an emotionally drained youth. The vocals are indistinct and sound more fatigued and apathetic than engagingly distant. They slip easily in and out of focus, and form more of a background for other meditations than a complete sensation.
The music itself is characterized by a silvery, synthesized sound with loud percussive elements like cymbals that add depth. Some of the sound recalls the sense of rainy-day desperation of the Smashing Pumpkins, but it lacks a certain edge of ferocity as well as a nuance in its emotional expression. The vocals in “Fading Parade” sound removed, and are frequently obscured by the percussive elements. The singer sounds paralyzed, often fading in articulation as if exhausted to the point of incomprehensibility. It’s the kind of music that makes your heartbeat slow and the light seem grayer, but it doesn’t demand enough attention to fulfill its promise of catharsis.
Occasionally, “Fading Parade” puts out a song that evolves into a sound a bit more memorable than psychedelic exhaustion. “Chills” hits hard in the opening with a rare urgency in the vocals, “She took me down / Till we were lost / Under the wide stairway.” Unlike in many of the songs, the vocals in “Chills” remain distinguishable above the electronic soundscape for almost the entire track. Eventually, the numbing refrain overwhelms the energy, and the song becomes indistinguishable from the rest of the album.
This is not to say that there aren’t decent lyrics. “Do What You Will,” for instance, has an arresting passage about flashbulbs from cameras reflecting in girls’ eyes—but the lyrics are barely audible. Too often the worthwhile lyrics fade into a breathiness similar to the sounds of the percussion and synthesizer, and the understandable ones just seem repetitive, almost too haltingly slow to follow. It seems that the artist intended for the listener to reflect their own moods and interpretations onto the lyrics, rather than asserting one himself—something apparent in both the vague sentiments and the opacity of the mood in a lot of the work. While this might occasionally prove an effective stylistic conceit, the result in this case feels apathetic instead of genuine. In “Do What You Will,” the vocalist addresses a lover, but the melody is static and unemotional—so much so that the experience becomes abstracted. There’s little humanity in the way the vocals are sung. Even in instances when the instrumental sound of a song varies—“Charades,” for instance, starts out with a haunting electronic melody distinct from the usual tepid backdrop—the music tends to lose momentum and one song begins to sound like another as each fades wistfully into the roll and crash of the synthesizer.
While the bleak aesthetic and understated sentiment may be an integral part of some psychedelic or indie genres, “Fading Parade” fails to make the sound consistently interesting enough to justify the muted nature of some of its other elements. There are moments of musical interest—the trembling melody at the beginning of “White Are The Waves,” and the coda of “Chills,” for instance—but this sort of music becomes rather tiring with repetition, and ultimately often fades into the wispy, synthesized backdrop. The album is built upon an uneasy need to feel something, but nothing it can produce or demand of its listeners ever amounts to true emotion.

In a recent interview with Fader Magazine, Lykke Li described the early work on her latest album as “really painful,” even as “killing [her];” but nowadays, she says she’s “just been having fun instead.” “Wounded Rhymes” was clearly conceived out of that relationship between pain and enjoyment, and it succeeds as a result. The album alternately floats and thunders along with a consistently dark vibe, alternately mournful and bitterly sexual. Lykke Li comes into her own on this album, developing strikingly rich lyrics supported by a new, cohesive sound. Within this darkness and depth, an effortless catchiness and pleasantly predictable structure inject “Wounded Rhymes” with clear pop appeal. The result is an unexpected gem—an enjoyable, accessible triumph of intriguingly creative musicianship.
“Wounded Rhymes” charges its short, catchy tracks with lyrical subject matter both dark and diverse, painting portraits of honest sadness and primal anger in rich, dynamic language. Within the album’s dark focus, Lykke Li covers a lot of ground, from the troubles of relationships on “Sadness Is a Blessing” to the abstractly portrayed, enigmatic psyches of menacing narrators on “Get Some,” “Jerome,” and “Youth Knows No Pain.” Lines such as “For life is like a flame / And the ashes for wasting / So honey don’t be afraid / To dance while we’re waiting” captivate primarily through Lykke Li’s consistently fresh poetic sensibility—her command of vividly mysterious imagery and figurative description.
At times, she also has a knack for striking, immediately relatable sentiments—lines such as “We will live longer than I will / We will be better than I was,” and simply “Youth knows no pain”—but on her more universally-minded tracks, her lyrics’ ceaseless blending of the real and the imagined rob them of a little human connection. A sense of merely observing Lykke Li’s emotions predominates on the album, but she denies access to her listener, walling them off with her own elusive poetic representations. However, “Wounded Rhymes” does evince a strikingly creative and expansive lyrical sense through its varied subject matter and ambitious description.
These dark, beguiling vignettes thrive in—and indeed, gain some of their conviction from—the moody, stripped-down, reverberating sound in which Lykke Li has wrapped the album. She’s chosen a relatively unvaried, limited instrumental palette for the entire album: basic, thundering drumbeats power each track, accented with low, reverberating piano chords, smooth synthesizer tones, and clattering percussion accents reminiscent of Beck’s more up-tempo material. These elements echo beautifully in the songs’ silent spaces, and Lykke Li’s soaring, rough-around-the-edges vocals arch passionately over it all. This dark atmosphere perfectly consummates the lyrics’ vision, but in doing so, also helps transmit the emotional context behind particularly obtuse lyrics.
Around these dark themes and bare instrumentals, though, “Wounded Rhymes” still firmly maintains its pop structure and appeal. Those same elements that conjure its menacing atmosphere—the pulse of the tribal drumbeats, the piano chord progressions, and the synth-organ hooks that fire swagger into “Youth Knows No Pain” and “Rich Kid Blues”—also breed a natural catchiness matched by Lykke Li’s simple vocal melodies and choruses. Most tracks embrace the pop traditions of brevity and structure, as well, with Lykke Li tailoring her imaginative lyricism to verse-chorus formats of three to five minutes.
The album is marred at a couple points by tracks that desert Lykke Li’s obvious strong suits. “Unrequited Love” is a minor setback—while the lyrics do offer some intrigue, there aren’t very many of them, and they’re repeated excessively. The song wallows along without a beat, catchy hook, or guiding format, but it concludes reasonably at three minutes. The album’s weakest track is “I Know Places,” where the decent lyrical content cannot support five minutes of languid acoustic guitar chords, after which the song slides into a contemplative synthesizer outro. The track shatters Lykke Li’s carefully constructed dark atmosphere, meanders along without pop appeal, and almost kills the entire album’s momentum.
However, these two tracks aren’t enough to wreck the success of the album as a deftly constructed work. On “Wounded Rhymes” Lykke Li explores the relationships between pain and pop, reality and imagination. She has confidently shaped a resonant sound based on an insidious catchiness and accessibility that leaves one hoping she’ll nearly drive herself crazy for the next album—and then just start having fun.

The House of Blues has hosted many large bands, but on Saturday night only one man with a laptop commanded the stage. Greg Gillis isn’t a musician in the strictest sense of the word, and the event was not so much a concert as a full-fledged dance party. Gillis, known by his stage name Girl Talk, lacks the musical pedigree of the typical House of Blues act, but he can still create a great amount of energy. By the end of his nearly two-hour set of mixing and mashing on Saturday night, he made it clear that mash-up concerts are just as legitimate a form of entertainment as traditional ones.
Gillis has released five albums since 2002 and specializes in mashups, or the blending of pre-recorded songs to make a new composition. Whereas mashups typically throw together two or three songs, Gillis often crams 30 or more samples onto one track, often from disparate genres and time periods. As scattered as his sources may be, Gillis manages to turn a collection of instantly recognizable sound bytes into cohesive songs with definite and wholly new forms. Ever since he garnered attention for his 2006 album “Night Ripper,” which infamously mashed Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy” with Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer,” his popularity has skyrocketed.
The crowds at Gillis’s shows are not just audience members, but performers. One man standing in front of a computer might become monotonous, but Gillis integrates the audience into his act: he lets masses of fans come onstage to dance around him, often engages in call-and-response, and channels the crowd’s chaos into his energetic mixes in a feedback loop of enthusiasm. The audience seemed to consist almost exclusively of teenagers and college students, many wearing colorful clothing, bracelets, fitted hats, and Ray Ban sunglasses. Lively and volatile even before Gillis arrived, the crowd chanted his name and engaged in minor skirmishes. When Gillis appeared to the thundering drums and guitars of Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs” and the obnoxious snarl of Ludacris’s “Move Bitch,” the crowd erupted into dance. The atmosphere was almost riotous.
Gillis fed off the raucous energy and sped through a dizzying number of mashups, including some from his latest album “All Day.” Imagining the original artists onstage necessitates more stages than Live 8 and Live Aid put together: Notorious B.I.G. spits a verse over the piano groove of Kanye West’s “Runaway,” after which the Ramones take the stage flanked by a swaggering Busta Rhymes. They retreat, and Fugazi enters playing the rumbling riff to “Waiting Room.” Enter Rihanna: “Tonight I’ma let you be the captain / Tonight I’ma let you do your thing.”
Some of Girl Talk’s mashups were fascinating solely because of the incongruity of the original tracks. He paired Simon and Garfunkel’s jubilant “Cecilia” with Eminem’s sarcastic “Shake That” and AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” with Drake’s “Over.” In one innovative section he burned through the Beatles’ “Birthday,” Peter, Bjorn and John’s “Young Folks,” and Wacka Flocka Flame’s “Hard in da Paint” in quick succession, before mixing them all back together. He often resorted to sing-alongs to rile up and unite the crowd: the room practically exploded during Kelly Clarkson’s anthem “Since U Been Gone.”
Dancing furiously behind his laptop and grinning ear-to-ear, Gillis seemed equally pleased with his creations. He ad-libbed throughout, each time to the roar of the audience (“Do we feel hot right now?”). At one point he got up on the table and grooved to Miley Cyrus. And he took two encores, seemingly delighted each time he came back. The concert seemed just as much fun for him as it was for the ecstatic audience.
Of equal importance to the music itself was the multitude of visual effects. Behind Gillis, a large LED light board flashed words (“Hey, ho, let’s go”), geometric patterns, and—for some reason—dinosaurs. Among a slew of items propelled into the delighted crowd were toilet paper, small balloons, giant balloons, giant plastic tubes full of balloons, water droplets, confetti, giant plastic tubes full of confetti, dolls, and large inflatable cushions. Each new wave of props renewed the crowd’s fervor, and between Gillis and the many diversions, there was hardly a dull moment in the show.
The night was all about the party, but Girl Talk ended his act on a less raucous note by mixing John Lennon’s hopeful “Imagine” with Bun B’s inspirational verse on UGK’s “One Day.” The crowd sang along, probably less for the message and more just for the fun of it. After all, the message Girl Talk seems most concerned with sending is, simply, “I want to see all your hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Linden Street is one of the many inconspicuous side streets in the heart of Harvard Square. Its low profile is due to the collection of back entrances that comprise the block, a series of geographical afterthoughts. If one didn’t know to look for it, one would likely walk right by the nondescript alcove that leads to the Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Department Linden Street Studios, its exterior cookie-cutter red brick Cambridge’s ancient staple. But inside, prime Square real estate takes on a modern, industrial tone—white walls, concrete floors, noisy metal air ducts.
Seemingly secluded from Harvard’s conventional clique of the politically-minded, from the Student Labor Action Movement to the Institute of Politics, it is perhaps not too surprising that the collection of VES theses growing in the senior concentrators’ respective studios displays little explicit connection with topical concerns. In a year when WikiLeaks revelations and revolutions in the Arab World have injected our culture with new foci for a discussion about government distrust and dissatisfaction, there is a dearth of artistic political dialogue at Harvard. Outside of VES, however, students have devoted themselves to artistic projects that further political and social agendas above artistic goals. While VES students seek to produce art as a personal pursuit regardless of its social implications, students without the same degree of formal experience use art as a means of political protest.
 
 
SUBTLE POLITICS
 
The left-leaning tendencies of artistic Harvard students are often palpably obvious within VES classes. "Like any kind of homogeneousness, it can be silencing or stifling," says VES Professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty. Lambert-Beatty teaches VES 104: "Culture Jam: Art and Activism" since 1989, a biannual class that seeks to question whether or not all forms of political public discourse may be seen as artistic expressions. When she explains to shopping week attendees of her class that she wants conservative students to take her class, Lambert-Beatty reports, she receives disbelief in return. She insists that such a varied perspective, though rare, is rejuvenating for intellectual engagement. "It was not only having these lefties in the class, but having one student who was conservative," she cites as one of the reasons for the success of the class’s maiden voyage. "Having that tension is what really builds the discussion."
Of course, there is no way to construct the optimal composition of classroom political profiles. Partially as a result of this homogeneity, the ideological motivations of student work are expressed less loudly than they may have been in previous generations or would be in a less segregated political environment. "[We’re] a lot tamer in the way that we think about social issues, partially, I think ... because we are in a progressive little bubble," offers VES senior Rachel D. Libeskind ’11. "Talking specifically from a Harvard perspective, I don’t need to go out there [in protest]. My rights aren’t being compromised that much … I’ve seen very little Harvard art that’s made politically-minded, in the sense of very direct, clear political allusions." Political implications might exist in Libeskind’s work, but they are implicit and may appear unintentionally. For her thesis, she is working with mixed media—newspaper clippings, old pornography, toothpaste—to create images that aren’t developed with predetermined social motivations but still clearly engage in social dialogue.
Therefore, and in keeping with the conceptually-driven pedagogy of VES, students’ work is not necessarily apolitical. Rather, some student artists produce pieces that expand beyond the artist’s personal motivations to include implicit political and social meanings. Lambert-Beatty refers to one theory of art’s social value that considers the social as comprised of multiple aesthetic levels, which consist of "what is thinkable and not thinking, what we can notice and don’t notice, what is considered a social category and what isn’t. Those have explicitly political effects." So while some students have used their work in the department as a means of expressing and furthering particular social and political goals—for example, the catalog Martha A. Wasserman ’10 created for her thesis last year on the Carpenter Center’s "ACT UP New York"—most have found that the conceptual challenges brought up in their classes and critiques have contributed more nuanced approaches to the message behind their art.
"I had the pleasure of taking a class with [Professor Amie Siegel], and she said, ‘Don’t make political art. Make art political,’ and I think that’s exactly what the VES department does," says VES concentrator Jason R. Vartikar-McCullough ’11. "That is to say, the process of making the work, the philosophical act of making a piece of art is the thing, not that the artwork’s subject is some sort of political commentary." Art can be political not only in its overt content, but also more subtly in its creation itself. "If you want to make a political commentary, make the work in a political way. Make it in a conceptual way, in a way that reveals its own process, in a way that questions and inquiries different lines of thinking and philosophies and opens itself up to conceptualism as a whole, which is a very process driven thing. But don’t paint Obama."
 
 
AMBIGUITY AND AMBIVALENCE
 
The nuance and complexity of opinion that characterizes the way visual art is made and critiqued complicates the task of creating any sort of protest-driven political art. In fact, this predicament extends to an ambiguity and ambivalence that pervades political discourse in today’s society.
Consider October’s "Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear," for example, an effort by Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to gather together those "who actually have lives and families and jobs (or are looking for jobs)—not so much the Silent Majority as the Busy Majority." The essential sentiment behind the rally seemed to be that, contrary to the belief that most Americans are apathetic, they are justifiably too divided on issues to want to shout their opinions out loud and force them onto others. Issues of political expression are not limited to an artistic context, but even extend to political discourse itself.
On our own campus, Harvard’s largest partisan political organization is attempting to engage in this increasingly brand of political-artistic creation. Since last spring, the Harvard Democrats have been working on a project called "1000 Ways To Be A Democrat," a collection of photographs that depicts individual Democrats along with text explaining their conception of what it means to be a Democrat projected onto them. "The basic idea of this project," says president of the Harvard Democrats Meaghan M. Riether ’12, "is to highlight the differences in our party, that we’re not all crazy, left-wing liberals—because to a certain extent that’s what people think of—but that people in our organization really are everywhere on the spectrum left-of-center and that we represent … a lot of different ideologies and … a lot of different stories." Tellingly, this project is less focused on aesthetic and conceptual quality than works produced by students in VES, and takes a much more obviously topical bent.
 
 
INTERROGATING THE STRUCTURE
 
This kind of practicality in artistic production, which eschews artistic goals in exchange for advocacy, is featured in classes outside VES. A new class in the Department of African and African American Studies (AAAS) this year, AAAS 109: "Using Film for Social Change," taught by Visiting Lecturer Joanna H. Lipper ’94, is being used as a platform to unite students’ idealistic motivations with a realistic means of communicating their objectives.
The class was introduced as part of the concentration’s Social Engagement Initiative, an interdisciplinary track led by Department Chair Evelyn B. Higginbotham. As part of the track, students are required to incorporate a visual component and policy recommendations into their work, as well as the traditional academic essay. The aim is to make the theoretical and more academic elements of a student’s learning more tangible in a real-world environment—whether that means practically implementing a clean water system in Ghana, as the first Social Engagement participant Sangu J. Delle ’10 did, or simply finding ways of interviewing subjects in order to capture the most important theme of a particular social narrative. "What I wanted our students to do was to wed these two things: academic work and the kind of work they would learn from," Higginbotham says. Academic work, she suggests, may present an insubstantial engagement with the real events of the world outside academia. "The idea of media across cultures, how to interview, how to capture the most important theme that is being conveyed by people in different parts of the world, how they are unique … the same interpretation and selection has to take place in a visual form [as in a written one]."
Higginbotham, who had been personally moved by Lipper’s films and photography, approached and hired Lipper as a Visiting Lecturer. "She is someone who combines both the intellectual standards we are looking for and the quality of a first-rate artistic project," Higginbotham says.
Lipper completed her own undergraduate career at Harvard in 1994 with a special concentration in "Creation and Expression in Literature and Film," which she used to study, among other things, questions of identity. She sees her own work as giving a voice to unrepresented groups, among them children and teenage mothers.
It is this inclination that forms much of the appeal of the class for its students. "I’m interested in how you use the micro level of a community or people’s individual lives and use those to interrogate the larger structures of government and policies and how [effective] are they actually," says Sheba M. Mathew ’13, an anthropology concentrator, and one of a few students who are currently trying to establish a Social Engagement secondary. "Film—especially the way we’re approaching it in this class—is a pretty good way to … just ask people about their lives. And some people are a little put off, but most are honored that someone is willing to listen to them," Mathew says. "Professor Lipper wants film to be used for social change in terms of telling people’s narratives and looking at those narratives and questioning the social structures around us."
Lipper’s class incorporates a number of angles to approach the relationship of film and social issues in creating awareness or playing the role of advocate. It involves weekly film screenings, featuring both fiction and non-fiction, technical skills training, mandatory ‘internships’ with the organizations on which the students will be focusing their respective final film projects, and readings. Comparable in size to a VES studio or a seminar, the class has drawn students from across the University. Mehron H. Price ’13 plans to use the class to supplement personal objectives that have been in the works for years. Though she has no prior experience with filmmaking or editing, she and her sisters have run their own non-profit, Kids Helping Needy Kids, since Price was 11 and they were struck on a family trip to Africa by the child poverty in her mother’s native country of Ethiopia. For her, the multimedia aspect of social work is not only an effective means of communication but a necessity for motivating involvement in a particular cause when there are so many from which to choose.
"I think the multimedia can strengthen your request [for donations], and I think people react really strongly to seeing individual life stories," Price says. "You can tell statistics about so many Ethiopian children are orphans, or you can follow one child throughout their day in an orphanage. And people will react more strongly to an individual life story." For Price, artistic integrity is secondary to social progress.
It is clear that AAAS 109 is not meant to replace the traditional VES video class; its goals are focused more on content and less on form. But it does make institutionally accessible the film equipment that may otherwise draw politically-concerned students to VES courses "We really try to make sure that for students who try to do this kind of work, there is a body of people who are guiding them," Higginbotham says.
 
 
NEW PROTESTS
 
Constraints on the political nature of artwork, then, lie most heavy on the shoulders of professional artists. For students in anthropology, a socially-motivated film might lend some legitimacy to a broader political project. For full-time artists, on the other hand, there exists a tension between the freedom that imagination allows and the compartmentalization that occurs in the public consciousness when a particular piece of art is identified as having specific political goals. Inevitably, the broader societal aspersion of political art filters into the creativity of Harvard students. And although this complex algorithm of consumer concerns and public perception may deter students from making explicitly political work, Harvard provides VES concentrators with ways of employing their critical eyes similar to those of other concentrations.
"Harvard is proving itself to be an incredibly productive crossroads for someone making art—an institution immersed in the universe of words and numbers, which has opened its rich ocean of ideas to young artists pursuing a different kind of path to the same set of human truths," Libeskind wrote via email.
Maybe the change lies less in perceptions of art, then, and more in political realities. "It’s a complicated time right now, so a lack of political art can reflect that—that it’s just hard to know what’s right and wrong. The issues aren’t super clear," says filmmaker Sam Green, whose film "The Weather Underground" about the radical anti-Vietnam War youth group was nominated for an Academy Award in 2004 and who recently visited Robb Moss’s class VES 51a: "Fundamentals of Video." "[There are] wars going on most people don’t think about anymore, the economic meltdown. In the sixties, anti-war movement or civil rights movement were these very clear cut, easy to see, right and wrong issues." Political commentary, then, comes easily in times of social clarity.
"[T]he young people in Egypt, they were very clear that … they wanted nothing to do with the older activists. And they did that—it obviously was smart—because they wanted to come up with their own new way of doing things and they did it," Green says. "So I think in some ways, it may not be happening now, that younger people will come up with their own ways of talking about the world, representing the world, but also trying to make changes in the world." The efforts of Harvard student artists may not look like our traditional idea of political art, but that might be because our idea is outdated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“First, always remember that either a story carries love and mystery, or it carries nothing,” advises the narrator’s father in Joydeep Roy-Battacharya’s new novel, “The Storyteller of Marrakesh,” as the narrator Hassan prepares to take his father’s job as a traditional storyteller. “Second,” he continues, “outside of the broad themes determined by the story sticks, the trick is to make up everything out of a whole cloth. Third, a story must not have a clean resolution. That way you will keep your audience coming back for more.” Early in the book, it seems that Roy-Bhattacharya lays out his rules for storytelling within the story itself.
In “The Storyteller of Marrakesh,” the first in a series set in the Islamic world, Roy-Bhattacharya explores the art and craft of storytelling by weaving together a multitude of voices and perspectives. Each character’s story offers clues to unravel the disappearance of a foreign couple in the Jemaa al Fna, located in the old quarter of Marrakesh—one of the busiest marketplaces in Africa and the world. The novel seduces with taut mystery and luscious immersion into the hubbub of the marketplace and its heritage of Islamic art and culture. Yet Roy-Bhattacharya’s broad scope and cacophony of voices let his attempt to emulate a fundamentally oral art of traditional storytelling descend into incoherence.
The beauty of storytelling, according to Hassan, is that it is a mutual activity: “What matters is whether or not we can believe each other’s voices, and the test of that will lie in the story we make together.” With this tantalizing suggestion, he begins an engaging tale that entwines two separate plotlines. The first component addresses the disappearance of a foreign couple and the involvement of Hassan’s youngest brother. The second reveals how Hassan became a storyteller and delves into his family history. To solve the mystery, Hassan invites other listeners sitting around him to contribute their accounts of the vanished couple. The voices of the marketplace—of waiters, of a beggar woman and her daughter, of the local fortune-teller, of the fruit-stand operator, of a professor, of an art student, and more—are woven into the story one by one, thread by colorful thread. This method allows Roy-Battacharya never to reveal the solution to the mystery; he approaches it through many voices that corroborate and cancel each other out, ultimately questioning the nature of truth itself.
Even as these voices accumulate, Roy-Bhattacharya, a master storyteller himself, builds suspense by shifting his attention to a new speaker just as the previous one is about to uncover another element of the mystery.  This constant delaying continues to beguile until the novel’s anticlimactic end, but it also leaves a lingering sense of disappointment. Still, the characters’ vibrant discussions on the nature of truth, beauty, love, and art add a level of continuity that counteracts the convoluted plot.  Each voice adds new information on the foreign couple’s appearance and disappearance, and also offers a different perspective on the art of storytelling itself.
In this respect, “The Storyteller of Marrakesh” is very aware of its own status as a story. Each individual’s views on truth, beauty, love, and art color their interpretations of the disappearance, giving the narrative a satisfying thematic unity. By the end of the novel, there is a clearer idea of what happened, but after all the voices have spoken, they offer a broader truth that is as unstable as it is appropriate to traditional oral storytelling—no story is told the same way twice.
Presenting an oral story in print poses unique challenges to Roy-Bhattacharya, but he tackles most of them with stylistic verve. The novel recreates the experience of being told a story: each voice is rife with its own idiosyncratic ticks, hesitations, and rhythms. Lively heckling and interjections from the audience introduce another mimetic element to the narrative. One major flaw, however, is the lack of clear distinction between the alternating voices of the narrator, Hassan, and the other characters. In an actual experience of storytelling, each new voice would sound different and would therefore be easily distinguishable. Because no such variation is indicated in the novel, it becomes difficult to discern who is narrating. The layers of voices become difficult to follow and smear the overall aural effect into one of murky confusion.
Despite this ambiguity, Hassan’s story is well worth the read—if not for the eventual, somewhat nebulous resolution of the mystery of the foreign couple, then for the mesmerizing descriptions of Islamic art like tile mosaics, Berber music, and miniature portraiture. While “The Storyteller of Marrakesh” wavers in maintaining its coherence, it is the promising beginning to a series that will hopefully continue to offer insight into the Islamic world while avoiding the stylistic pitfalls of its first entry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ll grant the current crop of Republicans this much: They sure know how to change the subject. Is there a long-term debt problem caused by spiraling health care costs? Easy: take the opportunity to gut domestic programs without tackling health care (that is, non-reproductive health care) at all.
Has the recession shrunk state revenues while increasing demand for social programs? Also easy: Take the chance to end public employees’ right to bargain collectively. Never mind that there’s no correlation between state fiscal health and whether public employees can unionize. This is a chance to union-bust, and it can’t be wasted.
That, in short, is the story of what’s been happening out in Wisconsin for the past few weeks. Like many states, Wisconsin is facing a budget shortfall. There are many ways it could  handle this. Perhaps the most sensible would be repealing the balanced budget amendment to its constitution, which would allow it to weather recessions without cutting services when residents need them most, or raising taxes when the economy is fragile.
Alternately, it could bite the bullet and make hard cuts and tax hikes. It’s doubtful this course of action would provoke much outrage. Leaders of public employee unions in Wisconsin have signaled their willingness to accept pay and benefit cuts, in the interest of balancing the budget. But Republican governor Scott Walker has rejected their overtures. He is demanding not just cuts, but an end to collective bargaining on the part of state workers altogether.
This is not about balancing the state budget. If Walker cared about that, he’d engage union leaders in talks and hammer out a compromise. This, rather, is the last play in a decades-long attempt by Republicans, to kill off the American union movement. It started with the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which banned union-only workplaces and allowed the government to kill strikes, reached critical velocity when Ronald Reagan used the bill’s powers to break the air traffic controllers’ union in 1981, and is culminating in the efforts of Walker and other Republican governors.
It would be easy to credit this development to crass interest group politics. Republicans have long been the party of business, and, wanting to keep donations and third-party spending from corporations and their executives flowing, they are naturally inclined to support legislation disrupting unions and keeping their corporate backers from paying higher wages.
But a healthy union movement, more than being a threat to corporate interests, is a direct political threat to economic conservatives themselves. After all, conservatives don’t adopt their beliefs just because that’s where the money is; that is surely part of it for professional politicians, but one would have to be unrealistically cynical to think it the whole story.
Rather, conservatives, like anyone else, want to get their preferred policies adopted, and realize that they need a powerful interest group on their side if they are to win electoral and legislative battles. What’s more, success will be a cakewalk if their opponents lack support from a similarly powerful interest group. Historically, that has been a key role of the union movement: a source of political power for progressives that can counter the role of corporations. And as union ranks have dwindled, so have prospects for progressive economic change.
Recent political science research supports this general hypothesis. Jacob S. Hacker ’94 and Paul Pierson’s book Winner-Take-All Politics argues compellingly that falling union membership plays a major part in skyrocketing income inequality in America, and in the country’s general rightward movement in recent decades. Cross-country comparisons bear this out. In 2008, 11.9 percent of American workers were in a union. In Denmark, Finland, and Sweden—which enjoy the most humane welfare states in the world—that figure nears 70 percent.
The same trend can be seen historically within the U.S. In 1973, 24 percent of American workers were in a union, double the current rate. Richard Nixon, the then-president, proposed a national child-care program, a government-provided minimum income for all, and a health care bill more comprehensive than the one passed last year. And he was a conservative. Surely, the decline in union fortunes has something to do with today’s Democrats championing what was the right-wing option in 1970s America.
The protests in Wisconsin are an inspiring sight, and show the kind of mass organizing for progressive causes that unions are capable of. But even if they succeed in making Walker back down, there is plenty of work left to be done. The Obama administration, for its part, is doing an admirable job of fighting state-level efforts to disrupt union organizing, but federal legislation is needed if the union movement is to regain its past strength. Such action is unlikely with the Republican-controlled House, but if Democrats make gains in 2012, and want a chance of preserving them long-term, they would do well to keep the needs of the union movement in mind.

River Run was a bit of a blur. Except for the pizza. I definitely remember the pizza. DAPA, the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisers, foisted it upon us, bewildered freshmen scampering from courtyard to courtyard. My newly minted blockmates and I grabbed a few pieces and went on our way. Now, as graduation looms, I’ve realized that DAPA’s pizza station remains memorable because it is a rare example of a concerted University-sponsored attempt to make late-night drinking safer. Too often, the focus is on convincing students not to drink in the first place and barring underage students from doing so. Still, students drink, often heavily. The University should focus on ensuring that these students who do choose to drink can do so safely and responsibly. In the light of skyrocketing alcohol-related UHS admissions, this focus becomes even more important. Fortunately, there are two simple steps that the Administration should take to help party-goers have just the right amount of fun on weekends: extend Brain Break and ensure that dining hall drink dispensers are operational.
According to an email from Ryan Travia, Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, the pizza station (which also dispenses water) is a “harm reduction strategy” intended to “help reduce incidents of high-risk drinking” on Housing Day Eve. But, this “harm reduction” technique is utilized just once a year. The rest of the year, the University relies on DAPA grants, which provide funding for students to buy food and non-alcoholic beverages for their parties. Ideally, DAPA grants would have the scope and name recognition allowing them to provide food at every undergraduate party. Unfortunately, many students are either unaware of the grants or are deterred by the need to submit a grant application days ahead of time. Nor do DAPA grants reach students who frequent extracurricular parties, final clubs, or bars and clubs in Cambridge and Boston. These grants are well-intentioned, but their reach is limited. Harvard’s administration should do more.
Brain Break must be extended throughout the weekend. Eating may be critical to weeknight study sessions, but it is equally important for safe drinking on the weekend. Felipe’s, Noch’s, and the 24 Hour Market offer late-night food options, but they are far from some of the Houses and financially prohibitive for many students. The House grilles are also a late-night food option, but they do not operate in every House, and anyone who has been to Quincy Grille late on a Saturday knows that it is often overcrowded. The fact that in many Houses students have no access to food after 7 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, whether they are drinking, studying, or just relaxing, is bewildering and irresponsible. If the University truly cares about ‘harm reduction,’ they should make it as easy as possible for students to make safe choices on weekend nights. Every obstacle—needing to apply for a grant, needing to walk to another House, needing to pay for food—deters students from making the choices that are in their best interest, especially when they are intoxicated. Providing Brain Break in each House on Friday and Saturday nights is crucial to maximizing the number of students who have access to food when they have been drinking, access that AODS has deemed critical to student safety.
Similarly, everyone knows that hydrating is key to avoiding terrible hangovers. Yet, dining halls often remove paper cups, unplug water and soda machines, or render their drink dispensers inaccessible on weekend nights. For students returning home after a party, this inability to access cups and hydration in their own House is highly unfortunate. AODS and the administration should work with HUHDS to ensure that cups are available on Friday and Saturday nights. These simple and affordable steps can complement the University’s already-strong alcohol education program (which helps us to think critically before we drink) and amnesty policies (which take care of us when we, by all accounts, should have stopped drinking earlier).
It is easy to say that unsafe drinking stems not from a lack of harm reduction, but from bad judgment and unsafe drinking environments in which people have little control over their intoxication. Critics might argue that final clubs or off-campus parties simply get students too intoxicated. Yet, after four years of observing and participating in this school’s social scene, I know that students are often fully conscious of the alcohol-related decisions they are making. They are looking for fun, for release, and for relaxation. They are also interested in and willing to take the necessary steps to ensure that their nights end well, no matter where they begin. Making these steps apparent and easy is in the interest of both students and administrators.
These suggestions are not meant to blame the University for students’ decisions about where to party or how to drink. Instead, they proceed from the belief that regardless of judgments about where, why, how, and with whom students are drinking, student safety comes first and should therefore be the primary concern of our community. Yet, I am concerned that the University may take steps in the opposite direction. According to Travia, AODS and the University are still determining whether they will operate the pizza and water station for River Run this year. To cut the station for budgetary or any other reasons would be counterproductive. It would demonstrate a lingering reluctance to pursue the easiest, most cost-effective safe drinking programs. As River Run approaches, I call on AODS to fund pizza for our bewildered, nervous, and soon-to-be-Housed Freshmen. But, one night of “harm reduction” is just a token gesture. Drinking takes place many other nights at Harvard. “Harm reduction” should too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cuts are finally arriving. Unfortunately they are the wrong ones.
Last Thursday, hundreds of students rallied outside of an Institute of Politics JFK Forum event featuring House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, protesting the pending termination of federal funding for AmeriCorps and other public service programs. The move is part of $61 billion in proposed "dramatic" cuts to federal spending passed by House Republicans.
AmeriCorps is a valuable program. It provides grants on a competitive basis that allow private charities to recruit corps members to mobilize unpaid volunteers in a variety of worthwhile initiatives like Teach for America and Habitat for Humanity.
Most importantly, AmeriCorps reduces the need for more government intervention in solving America’s most intractable problems. It is, despite government facilitation, private sector-based and free market-driven.  Nearly every federal dollar is matched privately. Republicans are making a shortsighted mistake in believing they are saving money by killing a program whose elimination will only push more Americans onto the dole.
I suspect, however, that many of the protesters failed to recognize the perilous context of the proposed cuts. That much was implied by rally organizer Samuel B. Novey ’11, who declared, “The budget cuts are an attack on our classmates and the work that they do.”
Though ideologically tinged, the cuts are primarily a misguided attack on the fiscal disaster America is daily sliding toward. Finally, thanks to the rambunctious warnings of the Tea Party, Congress has turned its sights toward the ballooning debt. These cuts are the result of freshmen Republicans clamoring to fulfill their party’s promise to cut spending by $100 billion in its “Pledge to America,” not to cut AmeriCorps.
The problem is that non-defense discretionary spending—where most of the cuts are occurring— comprises only 15 percent of the budget. Alan K. Simpson,  the co-chairman of President Barack H. Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, or the “debt commission,” accurately called the proposed cuts “peanuts.” The meat of the coming deficit tsunami lies in entitlements, not in AmeriCorps or in foreign aid. Discretionary spending needs to be trimmed, but not to this counterproductive extent. What we truly need is entitlement, defense, and tax reform.
The debt commission, produced a list of sensible proposals, like raising Social Security’s retirement age, increasing Medicare premiums and co-payments, means testing Medicare, and eliminating tax deductions and loopholes while decreasing rates. Obama disappointingly failed to include any in his gimmick-packed proposed budget. House Speaker John Boehner has promised the coming Republican budget will address the “entitlement problem.” Let’s hope so.
Critics have pilloried the proposed cuts, which would end funding of Planned Parenthood and trim the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 13 percent, as ideological warfare—a.k.a. politics—disguised as fiscal reform. Naturally politicians support cutting programs they think undesirable, but the painful cuts are also the result of a paradoxical electoral mandate to cut spending by a population that disapproves of cutting the bulk of federal spending: entitlements.
The truth is that if we do not address entitlements there will soon be no money left to fund anyone’s pet projects. Neither will we be able to pay for the military, national parks, the interstate highway system, food safety, or National Aeronautics and Space Administration. If we don’t act by 2020 Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt will consume 92 percent of federal revenue, and it only gets worse from there.
Democracy and the welfare state often do not mix well, but here’s hoping Americans and their representatives muster the courage to face reality and tackle entitlements soon. Until then, politicians elected on promises to restore fiscal responsibility who also desire reelection will continue to treat entitlements as a third rail and futilely hone in on precious peanuts like AmeriCorps.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting next fall, high school seniors will again have the opportunity to declare themselves to Harvard, early. Harvard announced that it would re-instate its non-binding, single-choice early action program last week, after having ended the program in 2007. In the 2005-2006 admissions cycle, 38 percent of the Class of 2010 was admitted under the program, which allowed students to apply by November 1st and be notified on Dec. 15 of admission, deferral (to the normal application pool), or rejection. On the same day Harvard made its announcement, Princeton revealed that it too would re-instate early action next year. With Harvard and Princeton both moving to restore early action, all eight Ivy League schools now have early admissions processes in place.
When Harvard decided to discontinue early admissions in 2006, the move was largely viewed as a step toward a fairer, more egalitarian admissions process. There was a general consensus among Harvard administrators that early admissions programs did more harm than good, in advantaging wealthier applicants who could accept admissions without considering competing financial aid packages and who had help putting together an application early in the school year. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 stated that ending early admissions was “certainly a win for students in the bottom quarter and bottom half of the income distribution”.
Nevertheless, the College’s decision to reinstitute early action suggested that this experiment did not have the intended consequences. According to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, many worthy applicants, “including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students”, were choosing to apply to schools with early action programs rather than considering Harvard. The decision to bring back early action was announced in tandem with a movement to intensify efforts to heighten interest in Harvard among underrepresented groups, through programs such as the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program and the “Return to High School Program.”
Our appraisal of early action’s return depends largely on the College’s motivations for the move. If the reinstitution of early action is, in fact, a sincere effort to open the admissions process to a more talented, socioeconomically diverse pool of applicants, then the College’s decision is justified. However, given the lack of transparency surrounding this monumental decision it is difficult to hold this position with certitude. The College declined to reveal any of the statistical evidence that informed its assessment, sharing only generalized conclusions it had drawn from examining admissions trends. In quoting the words of Professor of Public Policy Christopher N. Avery ’88 and Ramsey Professor of Political Economy Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62, we hope “this policy change is a selfless act, not some stratagem to outmaneuver its rivals.”
There is evidence to suggest both possibilities. Unlike binding early admissions, which requires applicants to commit to a school by an early deadline, early action gives lower-income applicants until the regular decision deadline to consider other institutions and financial aid packages. And all students benefit from the peace of mind that an early acceptance grants. Still, low-income students are often applying from public schools with overburdened guidance counselors and must deal with the admissions process largely on their own. These students must juggle academics, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities, in addition to the labyrinthine bureaucracy of college admissions offices. While it is certainly possible that early action reinstitution will give equal benefit to applicants of all socioeconomic backgrounds, anecdotal evidence, and speculation provide too little basis to say whether this is probable.
Indeed, Harvard officials have given evidence that factors other than socioeconomic diversity were considered in the decision to reinstate early action. In a Crimson article, Dean Fitzsimmons said the decision was based partly on the trend of increased early admissions: “We started to hear that more and more people were applying early across the country”.
Data collected by The New York Times on early admissions rates this year supports this claim: It reveals an 8.25 percent increase in applications to Columbia’s early decision program and a 6.54 percent increase in applicants to Stanford’s single-choice early action program, in 2011. Guidance counselors interviewed by both The Crimson and the Yale Daily News were skeptical that the intention behind this change was to draw in greater diversity. “They’re enormously competitive”, Jon Reider, a former Stanford admissions officer and current director of college counseling at San Francisco University High School, told the YDN, adding that Stanford’s decision to instate early action was an attempt “to fight for more kids”.
While re-instating early action to again level the playing field and is laudable, re-instating early action because peer institutions have not followed Harvard’s lead is distasteful for an institution that aspires to hold its admissions policy to higher, long-term standards of social equality. That the College has declined to release information to back its decision creates unnecessary suspicion that could easily be dispelled. We commend initiatives, such as increasing recruitment programs, that link definitive motivation with definitive action and allow for transparency in the system. The College should apply these same principles to all its admission decisions.
In light of the sizeable impact this decision will have on the future of the College community, we call upon the admissions office to release data on the “trends” that led them to reinstate early action. Considering the extent to which the College stressed the positive consequences that would come with ending early admissions, there should be a similar movement to explain the rationale for overturning this decision just four years later.
All undergraduates have significant stake in the future content of our community and the reputation of this institution. As invested stakeholders, we deserve to know the factors that go into deciding major institutional changes. Without having greater transparency into the motivations of the College’s decision, there is no way we can definitively support their actions.
CORRECTION: March 1, 2010

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reverend Peter J. Gomes, who oversaw Memorial Church for the past three and a half decades, died Monday evening after suffering a brain aneurysm and heart attack. He was 68.
His death was announced in an e-mail to members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship and confirmed by a staff member at the Harvard University Choir.
Gomes was hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital this past December after suffering a stroke. He was later moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston.
Friends reported as recently as this January that Gomes was recovering and in good condition.
They said that he hoped to return to Harvard and deliver the Easter sermon at Memorial Church.
In 2009, Gomes received a pacemaker after stumbling as a result of dizziness during a speaking appearance at St. Lawrence University in New York.
By all accounts, Gomes—who was the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at the Harvard Divinity School—maintained a tremendous presence at Harvard as well as around the country.
He taught the popular course Religion 1513: “History of Harvard and Its Presidents” and delivered prayers at the inaugurations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
“He’s been a brilliant preacher and has carried the Memorial Church and the heart of the College for decades now,” Memorial Church Associate Minister and longtime friend Dorothy A. Austin said of Gomes in January.
Gomes also served as an advocate for gay rights since he came out in 1991.
He was a prolific author, writing New York Times bestsellers such as “The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart” and “Sermons: The Book of Wisdom for Daily Living”.
He said that he planned to retire in 2012 after more than 40 years at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA), a nonprofit advocacy group has submitted a letter to the Harvard Corporation urging the University to recognize the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.
“We ask simply that the Corporation commit Harvard to official recognition of ROTC,” the letter said. “That can be done by the Corporation immediately—whether or not there is an official ROTC unit on campus.”
University President Drew G. Faust said in November that Harvard would recognize ROTC upon the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which prohibits gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. A repeal of that policy—which the University has said violated its antidiscrimination policy—was signed into law in December.
But the repeal has yet to take effect as the military reviews its potential effects, and the University has not officially changed its position.
ACTA President Anne D. Neal ’77 said in an interview yesterday that her organization has also written letters to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford encouraging ROTC recognition.
Though ACTA has advocated for ROTC for several years before the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” it redoubled efforts after the repeal, Neal said.
Some have argued that there is not enough interest on campus to justify creating a unit at Harvard. But Neal said that she believes that this is a “chicken and egg” problem, and that recognition and publicity of ROTC will lead to greater interest and participation in the program.
“We are very heartened by the words of President Faust,” Neal said.
Faust confirmed yesterday that the University is in discussion with the military about the possibility of creating an ROTC unit at Harvard.
“We have had conversations with the military focused on the gay and lesbian issue,” Faust said.
Recently however, the Harvard Trans Task Force (TTF) and other members of the community have protested that the military still does not allow trans-identified and intersex individuals to serve in the military—meaning that ROTC’s return could still violate University antidiscrimination policy.
“Recognizing ROTC does not prevent students from making this kind of a protest or arguing,” Neal said. But “there is a belief that it is time to make this service available to students that would like it.”
TTF members met with members of the administration yesterday.
“The issues that are being voiced now by transgender students are ones that I think the military hasn’t entirely sorted through because it has been posed to them over the last two decades in terms of gays and lesbians,” Faust said.
“These are voices that have become much more forceful and much more vocal in recent years.”

On the heels of a decision by the Obama administration to stop defending a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), members of the Harvard community expressed excitement over the decision as an advance for gay rights. But skepticism also remains as some wonder whether the policy shift may be a political ploy to solidify support among President Obama’s liberal base.
Last Wednesday, Obama announced that he would stop defending the legality of Section 3 of DOMA, which stipulates that the federal government only recognize marriage as the union between a man and woman.
“Optimistically speaking, Obama may be responding to pressures the LBGTQ community has put on him even before being elected,” said Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11.  “It could be a symbol of change and hope to turn around difficult times we faced with previous administration.”
“More cynically, the repeal could be speculated as, more broadly speaking, responding to his base and trying to re-energize it instead of trying to move a center that may not be moved,” he said.
Cabot House Tutor Stephen J. Vider, a Ph.D. candidate in the History of American Civilization Program, said that Obama’s move signified progress in the gay rights movement.
Vider—who in November married his partner and fellow Cabot House tutor, David S. Byers—said that, in addition to being personally meaningful, the formal acknowledgement of his own marriage also inspired hope in him that all gay marriages will soon be federally recognized.
“Judaism is important to both of us, so when we first got engaged, we knew how significant the religious ceremony would be for us. But I think we were both surprised by how meaningful the legal recognition felt, even just going down to Cambridge City Hall to get a marriage certificate.” said Vider, adding that he was heartened by the outpouring of support from Cabot residents.
Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11, Co-Chair of GirlSpot, echoed Vider’s hopeful sentiments.
“If I got married it would be awesome because I would be able to live in Florida—my home state, which currently restricts gay marriage—and be legally recognized,” Elrod said. “Obama’s reversal on DOMA means I can live peacefully in my home.”
Some students said that this decision represented the fulfillment of one of Obama’s campaign promises and was not surprising given his history of supporting gay rights.
“Repealing DOMA was one of Obama’s campaign promises in 2008. A lot of people wanted to make sure it happened before 2012 election,” said Katie R. Zavadski ’13, campaigns director for the Harvard College Democrats. "I think everyone is very pleased."
Since the 1960s, gay couples have worked to achieve recognition of their relationships before the law.
“Another important dimension to the announcement is that same-sex marriage is less controversial as it used to be,” added Chan.
“The wedge is losing its edge.”

The Mar. 1 article "Students React to Defense of Marriage Act Change" quoted Stephen J. Vider out of context. Additionally, the article mischaracterized President Obama's record on gay rights as exhibiting a history of support for gay marriage. While Obama has indiciated support for gay rights, he has not explicitly expressed support for gay marriage.

On Sunday night, Natalie Portman ’03 became the first graduate of Harvard College to win an Academy Award for best actress. She took home the Oscar for her portrayal of Nina, the troubled ballerina who struggles with perfectionism in Black Swan.
Harvard professors who knew Portman during her time at the college expressed no surprise at her success.
Former Harvard Psychology Professor and Dean of the Social Sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn worked with Portman when she was a research assistant in his lab. Eight years later, Kosslyn—who recently moved to Stanford—can see a connection between Portman’s academic persistence and her industry success.
“It was very clear when she was a student that she is a very determined person and capable of focused effort over a sustained period,” he said in a statement via e-mail. “She is now demonstrating the results of that determination and focus.”
Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz also considered Portman an exceptional student.
“She was in my seminar called Neuropsychology and the Law, and I didn’t know who she was because her name was Natalie Hershlag,” he said, referring to Portman’s birth name. “It was a few weeks into the semester that I learned she was an actress—but she was a terrific student.”
Portman’s paper on new methods of lie detection earned her an A+ from Dershowitz—the highest grade in the class. After that, Dershowitz hired Portman as a research assistant for a book he was writing.
“We talked a lot about her career,” he says. “She said she wanted to do acting, and she wanted at some point to be a psychologist.”
But Dershowitz in no way considers Portman’s divergence from psychology to be disappointing.
“It’s all about choice,” he said.  “And she has choices and options. She would be a great psychologist, and she’s a great actor. She probably influences more people in her acting.”
Dershowitz also said that he does not consider the two fields mutually exclusive.
“Her psychology background helped her in formulating the role for [Black Swan] ... She’s an actor who uses her academic background,” he said.
Portman isn’t the first Harvard affiliate to receive acclaim from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the Oscars. Mira K. Sorvino ’89 won for best supporting role in 1996. Other Harvard-affiliated nominees include Stockard Channing ’65, who was nominated for best actress in 1994, and Elisabeth Shue, who dropped out a semester before graduating in 1985 to continue acting but returned in 2000 to receive her degree.
Dershowitz said that Portman’s success is consistent with Harvard students’ achievements across the board.
“I never place limits on the potential success of my students,” he said. “If they’re going into acting, they’re going to win the Oscar ... If they’re going into law, they’re going to be chief justice.”
Kosslyn echoed these sentiments. “Harvard students should be leaders—and in my view it matters less what field they go into than what they contribute to that field, and to the society writ large,” he says. “By any measure, Natalie has played this role superbly.”

A new sandwich shop, Al’s Harvard Square Café, opened yesterday in the Holyoke Center arcade, quickly attracting dozens of hungry patrons.
“Right before we opened we had 35 people standing at the entrance,” said owner Alan F. Costello.
Costello said his motto is “low profit, high volume.” Customers can get a 10-inch sub, 20 ounce drink, and a bag of chips for $6.75.
Costello added that he promotes high efficiency.
“People don’t want to wait 15 minutes for a sandwich,” Costello said. “It works well with business people and now with students.”
A business efficiency study conducted by Dartmouth researchers recorded that it took 3 minutes, 47 seconds for a customer to get their sandwich from another location—Al’s State Street Café in Boston—starting at the sidewalk outside.
Al’s menu includes 24 sandwiches, including hot and cold, soups, and salads. Featured items include the Harvard Square Café Special with prosciutto, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes, and the chicken salad.
The shop uses quality ingredients, including all white meat chicken, Costello said. Bread is freshly baked every five minutes.
“I make the sandwich the way I want to eat it,” Costello said.
The Holyoke Center shop—located in the former Harvard University Press display room—was supposed to open in October but was delayed due to construction constraints.
Harvard Square is the third Al’s Café location. Costello first opened Al’s State Street Café over ten years ago in the Financial District. Al’s South Street Café opened in September 2008.
Those locations primarily serve office workers in the area. Costello said he is looking forward to serving students.
Freshmen Parker W. Sebastian ’14 and Manuel M. Cominsky ’14 took advantage of the bag lunch deal soon after the shop opened.
“We had seen it under construction  for a while and decided to try it out today when we saw it open,” Sebastian said.
The students were impressed by the quality and size of the sandwiches.
“I’m never going to Subway again,” Cominsky said.
The shop’s large windows in the Holyoke Center allow passersby to see the inside, which includes a counter, large menu, and murals.
“People get to see the buzz if we’re busy and what’s going on,” Costello said.
Al’s Harvard Square Café has scheduled a grand opening for Wednesday, March 9, when everything will be half price.

University President Drew G. Faust reiterated in an interview yesterday that Harvard remains committed to Allston, saying that determining the future of the Science Complex on Western Ave. is at “the top of the list” for the University.
“We’re looking very hard at the Western Ave. foundation to assess what we can do to move forward there, what makes sense financially and pragmatically for Harvard,” she said. “Some action on that site is very important to us.”
Faust confirmed that the Harvard Allston Work Team’s recommendations are due mid-year and the committee is still working on its report. The Work Team, comprising Harvard faculty and deans, was formed after the construction halt and was tasked with making suggestions for the future of Harvard’s property in Allston.
While plans for Harvard’s development in Allston remain unclear, the University is making short-term efforts to reinvigorate the Allston community, Faust said.
University officials are working to secure occupants for Allston properties that were left vacant following the recent financial crisis that led the University to halt its construction of the Science Complex in Dec. 2009. .
“We didn’t want to leave vacant buildings in a community that felt it had been negatively affected by what we had done or what we were up to,” Faust said.
“We have some new tenants coming in that will bring vibrancy into the community,” she said.
Over the past 12 months, the University has leased its property in Allston to 13 businesses and non-profit organizations—including Genzyme, the Silk Road Project, and the Boston Boxing Club—according to University spokesperson John D. Longbrake.
Most recently, the University leased 182 Western Ave. to Stone Hearth Pizza Co., a local family-style pizza chain.
The University is also currently constructing Library Park, which will sit on a formerly empty lot behind the Honan Public Library in Allston.
The public park, which is slated to open by early summer, will feature a large open grassy space, winding paths, seating, and a rain garden.
Based on the ideas of Harvard Allston Task Force members and local residents, the park will be “an outdoor extension of the library,” wrote University spokesperson Lauren Marshall in an e-mail.
The University is currently determining its priorities for an upcoming capital campaign.
Asked how Allston may fit into that fundraising effort, Faust said that “Allston is a very important part of the future of the University,”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a week-long hiatus for Presidents’ Day, last night’s City Council meeting seemed more like a session of the United Nations Security Council, falling into a spirited debate over the relevance of Israeli security training to the city of Cambridge.
Twenty-three residents addressed the Council in support of Policy Order #20, which asked City Manager Robert W. Healy to investigate a recent trip by municipal law enforcement officials to Israel.
The order was brought forth by Councilor Marjorie C. Decker in response to a trip by 16 Cambridge public safety officials to Israel for counterterrorism training, as reported in the Cambridge Chronicle this January.
The trip was funded by the Anti-Defamation League.
Those speaking on Policy Order #20, who were unanimously in favor of its adoption, included representatives of the American Friends Service Committee, Jews for a Just Peace, the Palestinian Solidarity Project, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and Jewish Voice for Peace.
Merrie Najimy, of the Massachusetts chapter of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said that Israeli counter-terrorism training tactics could encourage racial profiling. “It makes for bad community relationships,” said Najimy.
The order cited 2009 testimony from Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas about a similar trip to Israel that had previously taken place.
He said in his testimony that it was “interesting, but in the end not very useful. The Israel government does a number of things that we would never do in this country.”
While all resident speakers used their time to opine on the nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, councilors were more concerned that they were not informed of the trip prior to its occurrence.
“My intent is pretty clear,” said Decker. “It is to gather information.”
The policy order also requested that the City Manager investigate “the role of private business in public policy.”
Decker and Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 both said that the City Manager should confer with the Council about such trips.
“It’s not because we haven’t asked for [the information],” Reeves said.
Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. placed a hold on the item, delaying a possible vote until next week to allow for more public comment and information.
Councilor Craig A. Kelley also questioned how the City Manager’s Office’s responded to a “gun fight” on Clifton Street by not issuing a public alert.
Healy said that he had sent an e-mail about the incident to 50 local officials, including the City Council, at 1:36 a.m., shortly after hearing about the shooting.
The City Manager’s Office decided not to issue a public alert, he said, because the shooting was an isolated incident between two acquaintances.
But Kelley continued to pressure the City Manager to “take responsibility” for what he saw as inadequate communication.
“Councilor, you know that’s nonsense,” Healy said, raising his voice. “And you know I care much about this, so I chose not to respond.”
The City Council also passed resolutions calling for the resignation of Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gadaffi and supporting striking workers in Wisconsin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Friday. After pulling an all-nighter to finish his math problem set, Sanjay P. Misra ’12 leaves Adams House at 8:15 a.m. for his 9 a.m. consulting interview at the Prudential Center. It takes him 20 minutes to find a cab, which brings him to his interview three minutes before it starts.
At 11:40 a.m. Misra sprints out, jumps into a cab, and barely arrives in time for his 12 p.m. interview at the Harvard Faculty Club.
Forty minutes later he is again in a cab, this time on his way to Logan Airport to catch a 2 p.m. flight to New York.
The plane lands at 3:45 p.m., giving Misra just about enough time to get to his third interview at 4:30 p.m. When Misra finishes the last interview, he rushes out to grab the fifth cab of the day, so that he could catch a flight back to Boston at 8 p.m.
“I hadn’t eaten all day, and I hadn’t slept, it was just very stressful,” Misra says, shaking his head. “When I got back [to Cambridge], I had a cab driver drop me in front of Felipe’s. I almost passed out there.”
Misra’s recruiting schedule may seem excessive even for the average overworked Harvard student. Yet for the about 33 percent of the class of 2012 that was involved in on campus recruiting this past month, full days of interviews and day-trips to cities of potential employers are simply the norm. Recruiting can put a strain not only on students’ academics, but also on their social life and mental health.
FALLING BEHIND IN ACADEMICS
One of the biggest challenges for students who are doing recruiting is coordinating schoolwork and interviews. Even though students may try to avoid schedule conflicts, many say missing a few classes often is still inevitable.
“If you get the opportunity to interview, you want to take it because you are risk-averse. You don’t know what position you are going to get, so you want to interview as much as you can,” Benjamin L. Enowitz ’12 says, adding that he has missed numerous classes during recruiting season.
Adam J. Arthurs ’12 initially planned to submit applications at 64 companies—but ended up applying for 20 to 30—and simply did not go to class during the first two weeks of recruiting.
“Academics is the hardest part, because you are basically not a student at Harvard.” says Misra. In order to catch up, Misra spent a significant amount of time studying on his own and attended office hours for help.
According to Misra, although most of his teaching fellows and professors are understanding and supportive, not all of them are equally flexible with their classes and schedules.
For Misra’s class “Japanese History 145: Lady Samurai in Medieval Japan,” the professor held a make-up session for all students who missed class during that week. But another of Misra’s courses permits only one absence in section, after which students must write a five-page paper for each additional absence.
One common solution to minimize damage to academics is to pick classes strategically, students say. Some choose courses that have easier content, more flexible schedules, and are conducted in lecture format as opposed to sections or seminars—but this solution significantly limits students’ course options.
The ways in which juniors must limit their courses to accommodate recruiting is unfortunate, says Jennifer A. Xia ’12, recounting the story of a friend who ended up taking three classes at the end of recruiting season, one of which was pass-fail.
“It’s not that they don’t want to take four classes that are interesting; it was just that they weren’t able to because they missed so much material.” Xia says.
Not everyone chooses to let recruiting trump academics, however. For Timothy J. O’Hara ’12, who applied to 30 firms and had roughly 20 interviews in total, class remains the most important obligation. Even though he knew that he would have to miss class, O’Hara said he still planned his courses as if he weren’t doing recruiting.
“You are at college to take class. It is your number one priority. It’s the reason that you are getting these jobs,” he says. “You have to remember we are at Harvard University and the idea is to get a degree.”
SHAKING UP SOCIAL LIFE
In addition to conflicts with schoolwork, students in the midst of the recruiting must also cope with temporary isolation and stiff competition.
“It’s just hard to tell your friends that I’m not going to see you for a week or two. I wasn’t running with my teammates. I wasn’t eating with my block mates for two weeks. I was just by myself for two weeks just doing interview stuff,” Enowitz says.
Misra, however, found that the recruiting process fortified some of his friendships.
“I’m hanging out with my friends less in the social environment, but I see them more than ever before—in the interview building.” Misra says. “I get to see these people who are really awesome kids hanging out in the most stressful environment.”
But others say having many friends doing recruiting is not always as enjoyable as it is for Misra. When friends turn into competitors, interactions can become awkward.
“There is so much competitiveness among the students about getting these spots, so whenever you are talking about it with other students you are always kind of uneasy,” says O’Hara, who is in fact a friend of Misra’s.
He interviewed at the same company in the Prudential Center on that crazy Friday morning.
“To be straightforward is the best thing,” O’Hara adds. “Everyone knows what you are there for, so it just makes it easier to deal with.”
Xia says students are very delicate about discussing the recruiting process in general.
“You don’t talk about what interviews you had, what you are considering, what offer you have, or decisions that you are making, unless people ask you specifically.” Xia said.
“Everyone is kind of curious about what everyone else is doing, but then they don’t want to come right out and say it. It’s a weird tiptoeing kind of thing that everyone plays with each other.”
COULD IT BE MORE PLEASANT?
Although many students acknowledge that the on-campus interview program has made recruiting more accessible, they still hope the process could be less stressful.
Misra suggested that the program should have stricter rules on interview scheduling after he was given very short notice before some of his second-round interviews. Once, he finished a first-round interview at 4:40 p.m., and the interviewer called him immediately after to schedule a second-round interview at 5:30 p.m.
The Office of Career Services requires that employers give students at least 72 hours of notice for second-round interviews outside Cambridge, but there is no restriction on scheduling interviews locally.
“It was really not convenient academically. Stuff like this is not fair to the students because we are really doing our best to kind of juggle our schedules around,” Misra says.
In addition, students are sometimes given too little time to decide whether to accept an offer, some say. That is in spite of the OCS policy granting students until either March 4 or three weeks after the date of offer—whichever comes later—to decide.
Misra, for example, says he was once given only two days to make a decision on an offer.
Deborah A. Carroll, director of the on-campus interview program at OCS, acknowledges the existence of the problem and urges students to speak to the office about it.
“Our message is that we need to know in order to help anyone through it, and we won’t call an employer without a student’s permission unless we heard from many students.” Carroll says.
Carroll suggests that in such situations, one thing students can do is “play a little dumb”.
“To say, you know, ‘Thank you so much for the opportunity, and I’m so excited about it. But I just have a question—I was under the impression that I was going to have March 4th to make a decision?’”
“That very initial, very benign statement can often set in place everything that would rectify the situation.” Carroll adds.
To better coordinate academics and recruiting, students also suggested moving the process into January, during the College’s winter break. According to Carroll, OCS has considered this option, but it is difficult to make a quick adjustment given that the new schedule has only been in effect for two years.
As for students’ concern with social life and the environment of competition, Carroll says OCS has been contemplating a workshop which would allow students to come together and feel more sense of community. Carroll stresses that students are not in as direct a competition as they think they are.
“The hiring process is much more about fit than about number. It’s much more comparable to dating—both parties need to like each other and they both need to feel the chemistry.” Carroll says.
Despite its drawbacks, many students still relish the experience.
“[Recruiting] is obviously doable, but it’s definitely crazier than a typical Harvard life.” Misra says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is currently in the quiet phase of a multi-billion dollar capital campaign, which will aim to raise money for House renewal and development in Allston.
The total sum of the campaign—while so far undecided—could exceed Stanford University’s recent $4.3 billion campaign, according to senior Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators and donors.
“It will obviously be a record-breaking number,” said a member of the Committee on University Resources (COUR), an advisory group of some of Harvard’s top donors.
Given the ambitious nature of the projects that are likely to be included in the campaign, one senior FAS administrator said that the campaign’s target figure would likely break fundraising records.
“It has to be very large, by nature of what we want to do,” the FAS administrator said.
Though Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 would not comment on whether or not Harvard’s eventual campaign would exceed Stanford’s recent fundraising effort, she said that the University would likely set a “very ambitious goal.”
Several individuals with knowledge of the capital campaign who were interviewed for this story were granted anonymity in order to preserve their relationship with the administration given that the quiet phase is not public.
SETTING GOALS
According to administrators, House renewal—an ambitious project to renovate the College’s residential houses—has been identified as the campaign’s top priority, though development of Harvard’s Allston campus is also high on the list.
While administrators are unsure of the final cost of the House renewal project—one said that “I’ve seen so many numbers that I don’t know which ones apply anymore”—many said that the final cost could range from $1 billion to $1.3 billion.
In an interview yesterday, University President Drew G. Faust maintained her commitment to the process of House renewal, saying that “House renewal is going to happen.”
In particular, administrators have identified significant improvements to be made in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning of the buildings.
The College is also reviewing the April 2009 recommendations of the Housing Program Planning and Committee, which offered plans for revamping social spaces in the Houses and bringing the Houses up to fire, environmental, and accessibility standards.
Yale in recent years embarked on a major project to renovate its residential college system, which is similar to Harvard’s House system. Members of the COUR have toured Harvard’s Houses and have also visited Yale’s residential colleges, which some consider a model for the University’s own renovations.
“A group of us did a tour of the Harvard houses and some of the Yale colleges led by [FAS] Dean [Michael D.] Smith and we saw the difference. I think that the Harvard Houses have to be brought up to speed,” said one member of COUR.
Administrators announced earlier this year that they will renovate a portion of Quincy House in 2012, which Faust said will serve as a test case for future renewal projects.
“What Quincy will enable us to do is get a sense of what we discover when we take the pieces of the building apart and what we discover about the logistics of renewal,” Faust said.
While University leaders agree that the campaign will focus on House renovation, several members of the FAS administration say there is less clarity about the fate of Harvard’s properties in Allston.
According to one administrator with knowledge of discussions surrounding the capital campaign, Allston will play a significant role in the capital campaign as plans to establish the Allston properties as a center for science research remain on the table. Administrators have also entertained the idea of building one or more residential houses in Allston, but exact plans for the development’s future remain shrouded in uncertainty.
The University had originally planned to build a $1 billion Science Complex in Allston, potentially in addition to a neighborhood of undergraduate houses. Harvard broke ground on the Science Complex, but halted construction in December 2009 due to financial constraints.
IN THE EARLY STAGES
Before the public start of a capital campaign—a specified period of targeted fundraising—administrators solicit gifts from large donors in a quiet phase. During this phase, the University determines its priorities and sets monetary objectives accordingly.
Current fundraising efforts are largely focused on soliciting donations from the most generous donors, and the results of this outreach will influence later planning.
These fundraising efforts are not public and have been discussed as part of the planning process for the eventual campaign.
“As I have indicated several times, the FAS is in the process of planning for an eventual University-wide campaign,” Smith said in a statement.
FAS is not responsible for the timing of the University-wide campaign but will help in the fundraising efforts.
According to Rogers, institutions will often raise a one-third to 40 percent of the total goal in the quiet phase—which includes pledges, gifts, and planned giving—before the public launch.
As of yet, no date for the public launch has been set.
LONG TIME COMING
The University originally began the quiet phase of a capital campaign in 2005, but those plans were suspended after the rocky departure of then-University president Lawrence H. Summers. The capital campaign was further delayed by the financial crisis that followed.
Then-Vice President of Alumni Affairs and Development Donella M. Rapier said in 2005 that Harvard’s capital campaign would likely be the largest ever in higher education, “definitely” surpassing the University’s 1999 campaign, which totaled at least $3.4 billion, in current real dollars. At that time, Rapier said at the time that “high level” goals had been set but that dollar amounts for specific initiatives had not been fully determined.
Since that time, however, University officials have taken a fresh look at the priorities.
University-wide capital campaigns offer institutions of higher learning the opportunity to raise large sums of money for long-term initiatives and offer an indication of a university’s priorities.
“I think the genesis of [university-wide campaigns] in many ways was the dawning realization of what we know so well now, which is if you truly want to do the absolute best research and recruit the absolute best students and give them the best experience, you’ve got to think university-wide,” Rogers said.

Approximately 18 percent of Harvard seniors applied to the Teach for America program this year, a one-percent decline from last year, according to the Office of Career Services.
The program continues to be popular among both Harvard students and undergraduates across the U.S. as Congress debates a bill that could put TFA’s funding in jeopardy.
The recent proposal threatens to cut funding for several national public service programs including AmeriCorps, which provides financial support to TFA. The bill, which would slash the federal budget by more than $60 billion, passed in the House of Representatives on Feb. 19 and is still up for debate in the Senate.
“I’m not surprised that the numbers have stayed the same [despite the potential cuts], because the appeal of applying to a program like TFA is much less about the funding than it is the opportunity to impact and make a difference,” said Pia Dandiya ’09, who teaches eighth-grade math in Revere, Mass., in her second year with the program.
According to Teach for America’s Harvard recruitment director, Anastasia Baichorova, this year’s number of applications from Harvard seniors is consistent with figures from the past four years, the last time applications increased significantly.
“For the last four years, a lot of Harvard students chose to do teach for America out of Harvard, and now there’s a large community of Harvard students [who have participated in the program],” Baichorova said. “It is no longer an ‘alternative’ route.”
Alex B. Lipton ’11, a psychology concentrator who will be teaching high school English in San Francisco next year through TFA, credits the high volume of applications to the senior class’ need for a “push back” against what he considers the standard post-graduate route for Harvard students.
“Harvard does a good job of providing recruiters from the finance and consulting community, but I think there are more people interested in public interest jobs than their are opportunities for public interest,” Lipton said. “TFA provides this opportunity.”
However, Baichorova said the especially strong interest within the Harvard community to participate in TFA stems from a common mentality shared by many students in the College.
“Harvard students come to Harvard because they want to make the world better,” Baichorova said. “It resonates with them to directly go to improve communities and improve education. And they have the best education to offer and come with the best intentions to be leaders. It’s a good match.”
Although TFA does not keep data on the acceptance rates at specific colleges, 12 percent of applicants nationwide were accepted last year.
Interviews for remaining finalists will be conducted in March, and the decisions for the last round of applicants will be announced on April 4.

Harvard skiers have a tendency to fly under the radar.
But the Crimson’s top three skiers, freshman Rebecca Nadler and sophomores Alena Tofte and Catherine Sheils, didn’t need the spotlight to succeed this winter. Their results proved to be statement enough: the trailblazing trio qualified to compete at the NCAA championships.
REBECCA NADLER AND CATHERINE SHEILS
The top two skiers on the women’s alpine team stand at different heights and operate at different decibel levels, but the skiers will be go down in school history for what they have in common. On Sunday, they became the first women’s alpine skiers from Harvard ever to qualify for the NCAA championships.
“I’m thrilled,” Sheils says of qualifying. “I got edged out last year. This year it really means a lot to me. I am also really ... thrilled that Rebecca’s going. ... I think it’s just indicative of how far the program has come in the last five years under [coach] Tim [Mitchell].”
But success isn’t the pair’s only similarity. Mitchell says that the two’s focus and attention on the hill allows them to separate themselves from many of their Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association competitors.
“They both have that ability to narrow their focus and really execute,” Mitchell says. “When they’re on the hill, they’re there. They manage to shut out all the other distractions. In skiing, especially alpine skiing, one little tiny slip can ruin an entire race. The margin for error is so small. You need to be mentally focused.”
That focus comes from a lifetime on the slopes. Nadler came of age racing at Mont Tremblant, and Sheils spent five years at Burke Mountain Academy. Both took time off between high school and college to better their skiing as well.
“They both have fantastic work ethics,” Mitchell says. “They took that time to buckle down and work toward achieving a goal that they had.”
Each was already a seasoned skier when she arrived on campus, but this season the duo has been able to work together to reach new heights on the slopes.
“We can get each other excited—she pumps me up for the slalom, I try to pump her up for the [giant slalom],” Nadler reports. “It’s been really great to push each other and feed off each other.”
ALENA TOFTE
With her teammates succeeding in alpine competition, sophomore Alena Tofte is pushing her limits and making her mark on the Nordic courses. After all, you don’t become the Crimson’s first Nordic skier since 2004 to qualify for NCAAs by playing it safe.
“She has an ability to push herself quite hard, sometimes too far,” says Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “She’s still learning how to harness the fact that she has an unusual tolerance. ... Most of us hit a point where we say ‘this doesn’t feel so good.’ Alena has the mental ability to go past that point.”
Growing up in Duluth, Minn., Tofte participated in endurance sports all year round: cross country in the fall, skiing in the winter, track in the spring, and crew in the summer.
“I really like racing,” the sophomore says. “And I really, really like being outside.”
But it was skiing that stole her heart.
“I’ve skiing since I could walk,” Tofte says. “My parents kind of put me on a little pair of purple and green skis and shoved me out the door. And I got involved in racing when I was in seventh grade and my brother had been on the team ... and it kind of went from there. I skied pretty competitively in high school. I didn’t really want it to be a deciding factor when I went to college, but it ended up working out really well.”
Tofte entered Harvard as a talented skier and earned several top-20 results in her rookie campaign, but it was during this past summer that the skier really distinguished herself.
“There’s a saying that cross-country skiers are made in the summer,” City says. “Alena did a great job ... of getting in quality work.”
Tofte made herself into a top-notch skier despite spending a month of her summer with limited training options while doing field research in Australia.
“I was in the rainforest so I was kind of bounded by that,” the sophomore says. “And there wasn’t really a good road that I could go and roller ski on; it wasn’t very safe. So I ended up running for a whole month on about a ten minute loop and doing all of my long runs there—and I was watching out for poisonous snakes.”
Despite the challenges, Tofte built up a strong enough fitness base to compete with the region’s top skiers this season.
“You could count on her being in every race,” City says. “She ... keeps producing.”
The same could be said for Sheils and Nadler. For Harvard’s three NCAA-bound skiers, excellence comes standard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scoring four goals in a weekend is not an easy feat, but sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey made it seem that way.
Dempsey’s four goals propelled the Harvard’s women’s hockey team to two victories this past weekend against St. Lawrence, helping the team earn an ECAC semifinal berth against Dartmouth on Thursday.
Within the initial 90 seconds of the series’ first game, Dempsey put Harvard on the scoreboard with a slapshot into the open right side of the net with the assistance of two of her teammates, freshmen Lyndsey Fry and Marissa Gedman.
“It’s great to score right off the bat,” Dempsey said. “It gives me a lot of confidence, and it puts us on top before the game really gets going. If I get one in early, I might shoot a little more and play more offensively in the game.”
She converted her second goal of the weekend in the 13th minute of the third period.
After a well-executed pass from tri-captain Liza Ryabkina, Dempsey swiftly netted the puck to give the Crimson its fifth goal of the afternoon.
The second game of the series proved a tougher match-up for Harvard, even after having a 4-0 lead after the first period. St. Lawrence fought back, trailing just 4-3 at the end of the second period.
“Between the second and third, Coach said, ‘Hey, it’s up to you guys,’” Dempsey said. “It was almost better because it allowed us to realize what kind of team we wanted to be, and what kind of player I wanted to be.”
Following the lead of tri-captain Kate Buesser—who had scored just seconds earlier—Dempsey fired another goal into the Saints net for Harvard’s second goal in the final period’s first minute. Dempsey’s goal was the Crimson’s sixth and firmly cemented the team’s lead.
Ten minutes later, on the power play, Dempsey notched another goal, extending the lead to 7-3.
“The best quality she has is her tenacity,” Buesser said. “If there’s a one-one battle for a puck along the boards, she’s going to get it nine times out of 10. She’s got a great vision on the ice. Knowing that Jill’s going to have the puck is always good.”
Dempsey’s performance stemmed from hours of hard work on and off the ice. She’s been playing hockey since she was five years old, but she started off-ice training only a year or two before she started playing college hockey.
Her four multi-goal games and eight multi-point games this season have helped Dempsey earn All-Ivy Second Team honors.
“It’s a great honor, especially in such a competitive league,” the sophomore said. “I feel incredibly honored and humbled. However, I want to do as much as I can for the team. Being named that doesn’t really change that mentality. We just need to do what needs to happen and work hard.”
The recognition did not surprise her teammates.
“She just loves the game,” Buesser said. “With that love, she’s completely willing to put in the work all summer on and off ice. Just the fact that she lives and breathes the sport is a huge reason for her success.”
Her skills on the ice are not her only qualities valued by her teammates. Her eager and fun attitude in the locker room is also appreciated.
“She’s just a kid that makes you smile,” Buesser said. “It’s just awesome to have her on the team with me. I can always count on her for a laugh. You can always turn to someone like Jill and have a better day. She’s a talented kid, and she puts in the work, and I believe that that is the contributing factor to her success this year.”
With her vivacious personality and strong work ethic, Dempsey is eager to take on Dartmouth in the semifinals, hopefully to earn a place in the NCAA tournament.
“We just wanted to go in and win the next game,” Dempsey said. “It’s a one game season, because that’s all we’re guaranteed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday at the Ivy League championships, senior Kate Mills only had one more relay to swim in her entire college career, the 400 freestyle. The swimmer had no need to excel beyond her expectations, and as her time on the Harvard swim team was drawing to a close, she had already accumulated the highest number of points of any single participant at the meet.
But Mills is not one to let down her teammates or turn down a chance to compete.
“I don’t swim for Kate Mills, I swim for my university and the team of 40 girls who I train with all year,” Mills stated. “What I love is the last 75 [yards] of a race when it’s head-to-head and everyone is tired, and it [comes down to] who can pull out and get their hand on the wall first.”
Anchoring the 400-freestyle relay, Mills led her team to a close second-place finish with a time of 3:20.32, establishing a new school record for the Crimson.
“She gave it her all, which is how she swims all the time.” reflected co-captain and senior teammate Ali Slack. “She’s always 100 percent.”
After Harvard secured its spot as runner-up, Mills was honored as the Career High-Point Swimmer at the Ivy Championships, racking up 330 points over the course of her four years with the Crimson.
While Mills’ athletic career is one marked by repeated success in the pool, it’s not the path she had planned for herself a high school student.
Beginning at age 13 in her hometown of Sacramento, Mills’ talent between the lanes was complemented by her dominance as a water polo player, which had earned her the recognition of several water polo college scouts across the nation. As a high school senior, Mills was set on being recruited for water polo until she had her knee cap kicked out of place during a match.
Doctors told her that continuing to play would mean risking permanent damage to her knee. She would have to undergo multiple surgeries to keep her knee in place, but she was told that if she were to ever get her knee strong enough, she could attempt to make a return to water polo.
Because she knew her knee might never fully heal, Mills made the pivotal decision in the fall of her senior year to pursue a career as a collegiate swimmer. She chose to attend Harvard because of its respected swim team, but also took into account its respected water polo program, holding hope that she may one day return to the sport.
Mills had surgery on her knee following her freshman year here at Harvard, but by then she had found her calling on the swim team.
“To be quite honest, [my knee] is fine, and it gets the job done at walking and what not, but it’s never going to be what it was before the injury.” the swimmer noted. “I don’t think it’s in anyone’s best interest for me to ever play [water polo] again.”
Though fate pushed Mills to swimming, she put in the work. In a sport where scores and times are centered around the individual, Mills continued to maintain the team-oriented mentality of a former water polo player.
“We have a saying on the team that your teammates should be so trustworthy that you would want them in a foxhole with you [during] a fight.” Slack remarked. “I would definitely say that over the four years, Kate has become the first person that I would pick to be in a foxhole with me.”
“It’s been fun over the past years just watching her develop a mind-set that really is ‘team first,’” coach Stephanie Morawski said on the evolution of Mills. “It isn’t about how she swims or how she performs or what her times are, but it’s about how Harvard swims and how Harvard performs.”
According to her teammates and coach, Mills is very animated and multi-talented. The History of Art and Architecture concentrator has been an academic All-American throughout her four years at Harvard.
“She always has these amazing stories,” Slack recalled. “We both live in Winthrop, so we have a lot of meals together, and she’s always the life of the table.”
“She has some crazy dance moves,” laughed freshman training partner Danielle Schulkin. “She makes funny faces too.”
Mills has balanced her academics and athletics with outstanding results due to her enduring dedication.
“I swim very differently than a lot of other people,” Mills remarked. “I’ve never been the one to win the first 100. I think [what] you notice about all swimmers, whether they go out fast or slow, is [their] heart.”
Her hard word has already paid off, and she has qualified for the 2012 Olympic trials in the 200 butterfly. She will continue to train in both of her IM events in hopes of competing in multiple events.
“I think we could really see something from her.” Morawski remarked. “It would be wonderful to see her finish in the top eight at the Olympic trials.”
Above all, her teammates speak highly of Mills as a person.
“She’s an extremely talented women, both inside and outside of the pool,” Slack commented.

Housing day is just over a week away, and Houses have continued to release videos for both freshmen and upperclassmen alike to enjoy.
Sex seems to be a popular topic this year. Both Leverett and Adams parodied the popular song "I Just Had Sex" by The Lonely Island (featuring Akon) in "I Just Got Lev" and "I Live in Adams."
Lowell came out with its first video, "Like It's Lowell House," a near-professional quality parody of "Like a G6."
Pfoho continues its Internet meme theme in the House's newest video "The Most Influential Man in the World on Shuttles." The video features Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis, who was named a member of the "Time 100" in 2009 as one of the "World's Most Influential People."
The Quad is now fully represented in the housing day video showdown. Currier released "Haus of the Rising Tree," a song to the tune of "House of the Rising Sun," and Cabot boasted about the quality of its rooms in "Cabot Cribs."
Winthrop, however, has broken the video trend by placing Post-its around freshman dorms and buildings such as Sever and Annenberg that feature friendly messages for freshmen.
"We wanted to get the Winthrop name out there in a low-key way," said Patricia J. Levi '12, one of the Winthropians involved with the project. More Post-its will be put up over the next several days, she said.

The death of the Reverend Peter J. Gomes has sparked an outpouring of emotion from those who knew him both at Harvard and across the country. This post highlights statements issued today in memory of Gomes, who died yesterday following complications from a stroke.
 
"No one epitomizes all that is good about Harvard more than Peter J. Gomes."—Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates Jr.
"Peter Gomes was a unique individual and beloved friend. A gifted preacher and raconteur, a storied teacher, an urbane and generous host, a kind friend and prophetic voice, he led the community of worshipers at Harvard’s Memorial Church and scholars at Harvard Divinity School and beyond for decades. He taught so many that faith is not just what you say you believe, but how you live. His loss is profound for so many, including Diane and me. Our hearts go out to the Memorial Church congregation, to the entire Harvard community, and to his family and neighbors in his beloved Plymouth."—Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick '78
 
"He was a scholar, a preacher, a teacher, and a public intellectual who brought religion into politics in ways that illumined our thought. At important moments, he stood up for things that mattered—for freedom, for liberty, and for equality. He was a world-renowned preacher, a powerful preacher with an international following. So many loved him and were inspired by him."—Memorial Church Associate Minister and longtime friend Dorothy A. Austin
 
"In his time here, Professor Gomes witnessed the evolution of Harvard as a spiritual community. From the divisions of the 1960s, which he experienced firsthand as a student at the Divinity School, to today’s immense diversity of belief, Professor Gomes, through his generous spirit and moral vision, ministered to all, whatever their particular faith.
"Peter was recognized as one of our nation’s most distinguished preachers, a best-selling author who participated in the inauguration of two United States presidents. To generations of Harvard students, he was a wise counselor and an admired teacher who presided at every Commencement. To many of his faculty colleagues, he was a cherished conversationalist and a steadfast advocate of Harvard’s best traditions. But to me, and I suspect to many others, Professor Gomes was first and foremost a trusted advisor and a true friend."—University President Drew G. Faust
 
"It was often times hard to see Peter’s faith come through in his public persona at Harvard ... I was very struck that at the core of it all was this very strong Christan faith. The more you got to know him, the more you got to see that deep faith"—Jonathan C. Page '02, former Epps Fellow at Memorial Church
