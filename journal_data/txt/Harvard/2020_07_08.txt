After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admitted freshmen were the only College class invited back to campus for the fall Monday morning, but many in the Class of 2024 said they are displeased with the arrangements.
The announcement outlined plans to house no more than 40 percent of undergraduates — freshmen, as well as upperclassmen who cannot adequately continue their education from home — in Cambridge for the fall semester. Regardless of residence, all enrolled students will take virtual classes.
Students returning to campus will be required to sign a “Residential Community Compact” and abide by strict social and public health regulations. For example, they must submit to coronavirus testing every few days and cannot visit each other’s dorms or dining halls.
Some freshmen doubted how compliant their peers would be to the stringent rules. But administrators say if residents don’t comply, the offenders will have to leave campus.
Jasmine M. Green said she couldn’t help but feel let down after receiving the news.
“When I read [the email], it was like my heart broke a little bit,” Green said. “You can understand that it’s the right decision, while still be disappointed by it — and that’s how I feel right now.”
Administrators said they chose to bring freshmen to campus because these students benefit most from the opportunity to “build their Harvard network of faculty, advisors, and friends” and “learn about life in the Yard.” Yet Green and her peers were unsure these goals could be achieved in light of the guidelines.
“They want first-years on campus for the first couple of months in order to ease the transition to college life, but we can’t talk to upperclassmen because there will be no upperclassmen,” Green said. “We can’t really build personal connections with professors because everything is going to be online and it's much harder to talk to them if everyone's trying to access them in these small slots for virtual office hours. And then we can barely talk to our own classmates because of very restricted socialization rules.”
Some students criticized lack of clarity in the College’s plans. Samantha M. Galvin said she has qualms about what form social life can take in de-densified dormitories.
“They haven't really specified who we can interact with, how many people,” Galvin said. “They said we're going to have single dorms and no one's allowed in our dorm.”
“The only common spaces that they said will be open was the laundry room,” Green said. “It just doesn’t make any sense. The only place where we can talk to people is while doing laundry? What?”
Many incoming freshmen who felt let down by the plans said they were more inclined to take a gap year, delaying their Harvard career with the hope that college life will return to normal by fall 2021.
Over the course of Monday, more than 60 rising freshmen students joined a Class of 2024 group chat dedicated to discussing gap years. Members weighed financial aid concerns, plans for activism or travel, and other factors affecting their outlook.
Robert F. Greene, originally a member of the Class of 2023 who is currently on a gap year, said he might take even more time off in light of hesitations about the fall.

“I've already gotten the experience of the gap year, and that's something that I've really appreciated,” Greene said. “I think I feel ready to go back to school, but at the same time, I just need to weigh the pros and cons of taking more time off, versus starting school in this sort of fragmented way.”
As of late June, over three percent of students accepting spots in the Class of 2024 had deferred enrollment since the May 1 reply date.
All pre-orientation programs, such as the First-Year Outdoor Program and First-Year Arts Program, will be held virtually — replacing mountain hikes and live performances that many incoming students hoped would help them build social connections.
“A lot of Harvard students have told me that pre-orientation programs are where they met their first friends at Harvard,” Green said. “Especially because Visitas was cancelled, I was really looking forward to hopefully having a second chance at socialization with my classmates in pre-orientation programs — but it’s no longer the same.”
Orientation will also take place in an online format, which will include two to three hours of discussions, webinars, and pre-recorded presentations over the course of August.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a push to reopen schools nationwide, U.S. President Donald J. Trump called Harvard University’s plan for the fall semester “ridiculous” at a panel at the White House Tuesday.
Harvard College announced Monday that just 40 percent of the student body — including all freshmen and a select number of sophomores, juniors, and seniors who receive approval — will be allowed to live on campus in the fall semester, and all undergraduate course instruction will be virtual.
“I see Harvard announced that they’re closing for the season, or the year — I think it’s ridiculous,” Trump said. “I think it’s an easy way out, and I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves, if you want to know the truth.”
Though the campus will not be accessible to the entire student body, administrators have emphasized that the University will remain open.
At the panel, Trump speculated about the role of Harvard’s $40.9 billion endowment — which he also referenced in April as a reason the University should not accept funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — in the decision.
“I guess their endowment is plenty big,” Trump said. “They don’t have any problem with that.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the remarks.
The event — billed as a “National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America's Schools” — featured remarks from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and numerous other stakeholders, including doctors, educators, parents, and students.
Nearly all the panelists expressed a desire for schools to reopen in the fall, citing the academic and social benefits of classroom education and advancements in treating and containing the coronavirus, though cases have been rising in recent weeks.
Trump invoked the comments from other panelists in his criticism of Harvard.
“That’s not what we want to do, because it’s very important, as so many of the parents and instructors said today, it’s so important that the children — at this age, especially — are together, that they’re together on campus,” Trump said. “We’re going to be very, very strong on that, powerful in that view. We want our schools open in the fall.”
His remarks aren’t the only clash between his administration and the University when it comes to plans for the fall.
A set of guidelines from U.S. Imigration and Customs Enforcement released Monday revealed that Harvard’s online-only instruction model will likely disqualify its international students from residing in the United States.
The State Department will not issue visas to students taking entirely online classes and U.S. Customs and Border Protection will not permit students to enter the country.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow condemned the guidance — which he wrote “undermines the thoughtful approach” of institutions like Harvard — on Monday.
“We are deeply concerned that the guidance issued today by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement imposes a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem, giving international students, particularly those in online programs, few options beyond leaving the country or transferring schools,” Bacow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have released the first county-level map showing nationwide data on policies established to combat the spread of COVID-19.
The dataset illustrates the presence of seven different types of COVID-19 policies across more than 1,200 U.S. counties and federally recognized Native American nations.
Roughly 80 volunteers from Harvard and other institutions crowdsourced the dataset, organized at healthcare nonprofit Hikma Health. Cray V. Noah, a Harvard Medical School student and project organizer, said the complex nature of the data collection made the large number of volunteers crucial to the project’s success.
“You can't automate it – you can't have a bot go through and get this kind of data for you, just because there's so much variation from county to county,” Noah said. “So it actually takes a human to go look through, decipher, discern, and figure out what policies a given county actually has in place.”
Noah said his team has already made new discoveries through mathematical models based on the dataset, and project organizers expect it will prove useful for many COVID-19 researchers.
“The preliminary results have shown a couple things,” Noah said. “There's actually just as much intrastate variation in a lot of these COVID policies as interstate. And so that kind of highlights the fact that this more granular data is really important because the demographics and the culture and everything from county to county is so different.”
Noah said the interactive and accessible nature of the map will also make it an asset for users without medical or statistical backgrounds
“Someone maybe without an epidemiology or scientific background can go in and click around on these counties and see the raw data themselves,” Noah said. “A lot of times people are just seeing someone’s spin on data, but this, they can actually go in and see the raw data, the policies, the timestamps on the policies, and the way that the COVID infection rate was affected.”
Next steps the team plans to undertake include releasing its dataset crowdsourcing protocol so others can take similar approaches to gather information on COVID-19, Noah said.
“I think we definitely are at the point now where we will be doing our own mathematical analyses and modeling,” Noah said. “We'll also be publishing this protocol, this crowdsourcing protocol we used, so everyone can see how it was done. At the very least, those are two tangible things that will come out of this for us personally. And then the big hope is that this dataset finds its way into the hands of influential modelers and researchers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Harvard undergraduates say they are concerned about their belongings stored with Olympia Moving and Storage after the University’s Monday announcement that only incoming freshmen and a group of approved upperclassmen would return to campus for the fall semester.
When students evacuated campus in March due to the spread of coronavirus, Harvard provided students receiving financial aid with a $200 grant to help cover the costs of storing or shipping their belongings. Additionally, the Undergraduate Council introduced the “Storage Relief Program,” which paid the $55 balance that was not covered by Harvard’s storage grant.
Since most students will not be returning to campus in the fall, both Olympia and the University are working to accommodate shipping and extended storage periods for students’ belongings. The University’s Monday announcement also referenced a $175 storage and shipping stipend for students receiving financial aid.
Derrick T. Ochiagha ’22 said he called Olympia shortly after learning of the $175 stipend to determine how many months of storage it could covered.
“Olympia essentially said that they had no idea Harvard was doing this. They said that the rates they had for college students were significantly lower than their usual rates and that they hadn’t planned to store the boxes any longer than September,” Ochiagha explained.
“They told me, as far as they were aware, that they were still delivering the boxes back to Harvard on the predetermined date. They were never in communication with Harvard to know that Harvard was not planning to get sophomores, juniors, and seniors back to campus.”
Rachael F. Lyons, the director of marketing and business development at Olympia, wrote in an email that the company will work to meet the University’s needs.
“I am not sure if a plan for these students’ belongings has been confirmed with the university yet,” Lyons wrote. “Regardless, Olympia will ensure we have the capacity to accommodate whatever the university plans for next steps.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane did not provide comment on the storage plans.
UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22 said the UC is currently working on “contingency plans” to continue to provide extra funding for student storage.
“We would like to do the same thing we did for summer storage, which is to be able to pay the difference between what Harvard is giving and the total. Right now, we don’t know what that difference is,” Harris said. “There are so many variables that most of our plans are mere frameworks for now.”
Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22, the UC finance committee chair, said the UC’s plans to finance student storage have faced pushback in the past from administrators including Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt and former Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller.
“We had about $130,000 left in our budget, and we wanted to give as much of that away to students in the form of storage subsidies. We wanted to work with [house committee] chairs to get some of their budget for subsidies for students in their houses, but Dean Brandt basically told them no,” Ganesh said.
“Dean Brandt spoke to our then advisor Dean Miller, and Dean Miller told us not to do the program and that he did not support the program and that we should just save our money,” she said. “We knew that students needed this program, so we decided to go ahead and do it anyway.”
Despite the confusion, Samyra C. Miller ’21 said she is “confident” the College will resolve any storage issues before the fall semester commences.
“I am confident that they can get everything resolved, but I need them to start the process of doing so,” Miller said. “In the meantime, Olympia, keep my stuff safe. I have my fan stored in there and my microphone and my linens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 8, 2020, at 11:30 p.m. 
Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit in District Court in Boston Wednesday morning against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to bar DHS and ICE from enforcing federal guidelines barring international students attending colleges and universities offering only online courses from staying in the United States.
The guidelines would mandate that they transfer to an institution offering in-person instruction or risk “immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.”
“The order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness,” Bacow wrote in an email to affiliates. “We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.”
DHS did not respond to requests for comment. ICE declined to comment, citing the pending lawsuit.
The guidelines were released just hours after Harvard announced it would house no more than 40 percent of undergraduates and would hold all College classes online in the fall. The lawsuit repeatedly states that the announcement created “chaos” at Harvard, MIT, and universities nationwide.
“We will pursue this case vigorously so that our international students—and international students at institutions across the country—can continue their studies without the threat of deportation,” Bacow wrote.
Northeastern University announced in a tweet Wednesday afternoon that it was joining the lawsuit against DHS and ICE. The university has the third-highest number of international students in the United States.
Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University also announced they will sign amicus briefs in support of the lawsuit.
The move by immigration authorities sparked legal action almost immediately — Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Tuesday that her office “will sue” over the guidelines, which she called “cruel” and “illegal.”
Still, Bacow and Harvard chose not to wait for Healey’s suit. Their case argues that the guidelines violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to consider “important aspects of the problem” in advance of its release, failing to provide a reasonable basis for the policy, and failing to adequately notify the public.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said in a panel Monday that Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott is also contacting ambassadors on behalf of international students.
“As a university with a profound commitment to residential education, we hope and intend to resume full in-person instruction as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so,” Bacow wrote. “But, until that time comes, we will not stand by to see our international students’ dreams extinguished by a deeply misguided order. We owe it to them to stand up and to fight—and we will.”
Asked about the lawsuit, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “the policy speaks for itself.”
“You don’t get a visa for taking online classes from, let’s say, the University of Phoenix, so why would you if you were just taking online classes generally?” McEnany said at a Wednesday afternoon press conference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the aftermath of Harvard College’s fall planning announcement, undergraduates have agitated against Harvard’s decision to maintain tuition rates for its now entirely remote course offerings and have charged the College with failing to support low-income students.
Administrators announced Monday that Harvard would house no more than 40 percent of undergraduates — including freshmen and upperclassmen who successfully petition for residency — in Cambridge for the fall semester. Regardless of whether they reside on campus or not, all enrolled students will take virtual classes.
Students immediately took to Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms to scoff at the nearly $50,000 price tag on their virtual Harvard experience, questioning the high costs without on-campus perks and resources. Tuition for the full 2020-2021 academic year is set at $49,653, marking a four percent increase over last year’s $47,730, not including room, board, and other fees.
Undergraduates on financial aid further decried what they characterized as limited institutional support, as well as confusion over storage and leave of absence policies.
Samyra C. Miller ’21 criticized the College's decision to charge full tuition even though students will take virtual classes.
“So we're off campus — the majority of us — without the campus resources, and we're still paying 50-plus thousand dollars,” Miller said. “Oh, and you also increase tuition $2,000 a year. Please make it make sense.”
Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 also said he believed that despite Harvard’s best efforts, online classes cannot possibly match the quality of in-person learning.
“Sure, there's probably some value in learning public speaking via Zoom, but is that going to be the same as learning how to publicly speak to a group of people? Or taking a Theater, Dance, Media class or a film class?” Kumar said. “Sure, they can ship you a camera, but without being able to go out into campus and work with the professor, I just don't see how you can gain any concrete knowledge just based on reading a textbook or watching a video online.”
He added that he believed the loss of access to Harvard buildings, libraries, events, recreational activities, and networking opportunities also justified lower tuition costs.
Kumar created a petition shortly after Harvard’s announcement on Monday calling on the College to reduce its tuition fees for the fall semester. The petition had garnered more than 600 signatures as of Tuesday evening.
Several undergraduates further questioned why tuition rates per class should be greater for College students than at the Harvard Extension School, which provided many courses online prior to the pandemic.
Miller noted that Extension School students pay significantly less for some of the same courses offered by the College. On average, Extension School students pay roughly $2,000 per class, compared to College students who dish out near $6,000.
Several other students referenced additional financial concerns about Harvard’s approach to reopening in the fall that could disproportionately disadvantage low-income students.
Though Harvard has committed to calculating students’ financial aid award with a “COVID-19 Remote Room and Board” allowance of $5,000 per semester and relieving them of their term-time work expectation this fall, many low-income undergraduates said they felt these measures insufficiently addressed their needs.
Prior to learning that Harvard would only welcome freshmen and some upperclassmen back to campus in the fall, Abrar Trabulsi ’22 said she assumed Harvard would offer students receiving financial aid a stipend of around $10,000 a semester to supplant the usual costs of room and board.
Trabulsi, who said she is a low-income student, said she was considering renting an apartment using that allowance during the fall, but was shocked when she learned Harvard would grant only half that amount.
“There are some people who again don't have great housing situations and have very toxic and unstable home lives who were probably counting on this money to find a way to leave their homes,” Trabulsi said. “$5,000 is not enough in the United States anywhere to rent, pay for food and utilities. And with the COVID situation, it's not like you could get a part-time job because there are none. Millions of people are unemployed.”
Treasure F. Brooks ’21, who said she is on full financial aid, also said Harvard’s blanket allowance of $5,000 for all undergraduates receiving aid from the College fails to account for those students’ varying degrees of financial need.
“For some students on aid, this means you get 5,000 extra dollars, whereas the rest of us who deal with real world financial independence everyday will have to stretch that to cover their rent, groceries, internet for a full semester,” Brooks said.
“It's hard to believe that it was a thoughtful decision truly meant to support students who are facing financial hardship and not just used to quiet us,” she added.
Administrators wrote in their Monday email that the College will accommodate as many students who “must be on campus to progress academically” this fall as it can without going beyond the 40 percent threshold. It defined this cohort as students lacking adequate technology and internet, quiet work spaces, uninterrupted time to commit to their studies, and food and housing security, in addition to those with fraught family circumstances, among others.
Shavonna E. Jackson ’22, who also said she is on full financial aid, echoed the criticism that the $5,000 grant is insufficient to cover off-campus living expenses for low-income students who cannot live at home. Since her home environment is not conducive to focused study, she said she plans to petition Harvard to allow her back on campus — though she is wary of taking one of the limited spots from peers who might need it even more.
“It's really, really messed up that someone in a low-income position, in a place that is not really suitable for learning has to think about ‘Oh, people might have it worse than me. So maybe I should not apply for the housing,’” she said. “I know people who are completely homeless.”
Jackson suggested the College pledge to subsidize off-campus housing for students it cannot accommodate in its residential buildings.
“Giving them room is not enough,” she added. “How are people going to eat? Do you want people to just starve and take classes? I don't understand how they expect someone who's not functioning with a fully fed stomach to do well in classes. It's all intertwined.”
In the months spent anticipating Monday’s announcement, many College students mulled whether they would prefer to take a leave of absence rather than complete a full semester of classes online. For many students, the confirmation that Harvard would not permit most upperclassmen to return to campus in the fall solidified these plans.
While administrators have repeatedly assured students that Harvard would not change its leave of absence policies to deter leaves, they noted that the College could not necessarily guarantee students housing upon their return.
Trabulsi said she felt Harvard’s failure to promise students who take a leave of absence next semester housing when they return unfairly “coerces” low-income students to enroll in a semester of online classes while higher-income students can opt to take time off to avoid remote learning.
“For the low-income student who might not be able to adequately, successfully take classes online due to varying home situations and home instability, you're basically backing them into a corner,” Trabulsi said. “They’re going to have to choose to take the online classes knowing that if they take time off, when they try to return, they’re not going to be guaranteed housing.”
Jacob A. Heberle ’22 — who said he is partly responsible for providing for his family in Hawaii — similarly said a gap year is off the table for him, though time zone differences might undermine his academic experience. He said he knows he won’t be guaranteed housing upon his return should he take a leave and wouldn’t have the “energy or the time or the resources” to find his own place off-campus.
Heberle added that he has been working, cooking, and caring for his retired father since he returned home this spring.
“I think one of the things that sucks about this announcement is that it really just exposes socioeconomic disparities at Harvard. I mean, a lot of my friends are planning on maybe getting an apartment together,” he said. “It’s just an option that I can't even consider.”
“I have to be back here if Harvard's not going to take me in their dorm,” Heberle explained, citing tight finances and tuition he can “barely afford” otherwise. “Some students are going to be able to deal with this easier than others. The fact that the University isn't doing anything to give extra aid is just making this disparity worse.”
“I'm just gonna try to power through it,” Heberle added.
Another issue low-income students cited was that of shipping and storage. Students on financial aid said that they will incur prohibitive costs trying to get their belongings back and that Harvard’s pledged $175 subsidy would only make a small dent in the charge.
“[Storage is] like $100 a month and you want me to pay that for the next 10 months?” Jackson asked. “That's another thousand dollars.”
She added that shipping her heavy boxes of winter clothes home to California will likewise prove unbearably expensive.
“That is a major concern of mine, which is the reason why I would want to go back to campus or somewhere nearby,” she explained. “Storage is a big, big issue that a lot of people and a lot of schools just overlook.”
Immediately following Harvard’s release of its fall plans, a contingent of undergraduates mobilized to identify student concerns about the fall semester and draft petitions to administrators. Madison A. Trice ’21 created a group chat — now populated by over 200 — for students across grade levels to collaborate on advocating for disadvantaged students.
“I'm hoping we can get Harvard to do better by our community because everyone deserves to have their basic needs provided for,” Trice said. “It's a really special community and it deserves better.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment in response to student criticisms.
Students have lambasted Harvard’s efforts to support low-income students throughout its entire management of the coronavirus crisis and especially spring, when the College mandated that all undergraduates vacate campus within five days. Undergraduates argued that the administration effectively evicted its most vulnerable cohort, neglecting to ensure that they had food and housing stability, or internet connection and quiet study spaces, after they stepped off campus.
Brooks emphasized that her low-income peers’ woes surrounding the College’s policies were far from a problem that exists only at Harvard.
“This is an issue with higher education,” she said. “How do we leverage our privilege as Harvard students with greater visibility to illuminate the issues that are happening with other students in higher education that are getting a much worse deal than Harvard students are?”
Brooks also said the challenges facing low-income students extend beyond Harvard’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. She urged students to identify and mitigate the existing inequalities that the coronavirus has only exacerbated.
“If this decision is framed in the context of COVID alone, then when COVID relief efforts hopefully succeed, this will end at some point,” she said. “But what does our community look like afterwards and what has changed?”
