After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the title track to their upcoming 12th studio album, “Revolution Radio,” Green Day attempt to reconnect with their roots. The song’s goal appears to be to reignite the protest spirit of “American Idiot” (2004) while simultaneously going back to the band’s roots with a distinctly ’90s punk sound. If the entirety of the album is anything like the title track, however, we’re in for a major disappointment. “Revolution Radio” has an extremely unoriginal and predictable sound that—coupled with lyrics that are similar in quality to those written by a Disney boy band—fails to bring Green Day anywhere close to the magic they created in their heyday.
The song begins with a guitar riff that sounds like something out of “Basket Case,” reminiscent of Green Day’s distinctly punk tone. However, the song quickly becomes painfully repetitive. With a simplistic verse-chorus-verse-chorus scheme, the song lacks the band’s unique bridges and instead takes on the structure of a pop song rather than that of a punk-rock song. It’s almost as though Green Day found a decent sound they liked and decided to just roll with it, without any attempt to build on that sound and develop it into something truly worthwhile. By midway through the song, the guitar riff is overly chaotic and trite.
Lines such as “legalize the truth” and “we will be seen but not be heard”sound as though they were written by an angry eighth grader. In the past, the band epitomized the anti-establishment and rebellious music of the 21st century. Now, “Revolution Radio” tries too hard and feels forced. It lacks the natural quality of Green Day’s older music.
“Revolution Radio” misses the mark. However, the title track has the right goals in mind when attempting to emulate prior success. Green Day need to use their old methods to once again be innovative, something that above all “Revolution Radio” fails at. It is truly boring.

One of the main issues plaguing popular music today is perhaps that of live performance: As popular music is (in part) becoming synonymous with EDM, more and more musicians are tempted, as described by the producer deadmau5 in a vulgar and (unintentionally) amusing blog post, to simply press “play”. The indie electro-soul artist James Blake isn’t popular in a conventional sense—the sheer number of labels needed to describe him is indicative of that—but a remarkable feature of his live shows is that they truly are live. Such was his one-and-a-half hour long performance promoting his new polished—but still uncompromisingly experimental—new album, “The Colour in Anything,” at the House of Blues in Boston. As one could hardly describe Blake as a natural performer, and as his particular brand of sentimental electronica seems unconducive to replication under concert conditions, the substantial success of his live set is remarkable.
Impressively, Blake sang and played the piano while simultaneously producing his songs on stage. He was occasionally aided in the latter by his long-time collaborators, Rob McAndrews on guitar and Ben Assiter on drums. Blake’s beguiling voice, which ranged tonally between mellow and metallic, has increasingly become an invaluable asset in his shows. Also striking was its complete authenticity compared to its sound on his record, especially on the demanding “Choose Me.” Furthermore, there was a thoughtful chronological progression of the songs as the siren-like sounds of “Radio Silence” cohered organically with the dubstep and grime-influenced remix of Untold’s “Stop What You’re Doing.” Such blocks of bass-heavy tracks were usually interspersed with minimalist piano based reflections such as “Love Me In Whatever Way” and “Retrograde” (one of Blake’s most successful singles to date)—the latter of which was the one song where the usually restrained and respectful audience seemed to have felt compelled to sing along.
The stage was set up to match the character of his new record, which is less minimalist only in comparison to his earlier work. It consisted of three square podiums, each with a light-emitting cube hanging above the podium. Blake positioned himself on the right one in a visual representation of his musical dedication to asymmetry. There were instances in which Blake relied on the normally clichéd single-light-on-singer-songwriter model. Here, however, it served as a welcome break from the seizure-inducing green and red lights that enhanced the urgent loneliness of “Timeless (Remix)” and “Voyeur.” Appropriately, the background screen was mostly kept simple—it alternated between slowly transforming geometric visuals that supplemented some of his newer works, such as the Rick Rubin co-produced “Modern Soul,” and a pure black.
His treatment of songs on which he had collaborated with other artists was largely exceptional. He expanded on his vocal appearance on Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (on a barely minute long, interlude-like “Forward”). Although the original polyphony was gone, he played a full version of the song where the ballad-like quality, combined with sonical sparseness, effectively resonated with the listeners even in its longer form. “Life Round Here,” a collaboration with Chance the Rapper, easily adapted to live performance—the lone change was that the bass was radically amped up, which was sufficient to make it a crowd-pleaser by Blake’s standards.
The few disappointing parts of the set consisted largely of some slightly rushed performances. This was the case with his version of “I Need a Forest Fire,” originally a duet with Bon Iver, which lost some of its original pristine beauty by increasing the volume of the bass during the performance. A similar hastiness was present on his cover of Feist’s “Limit To Your Love,” whose album version featured an almost impossibly long pause. However, the choice to significantly shorten it in concert seemed rather reasonable: Attempting a successful 5-second silence is a risk not many are willing to take on, even though such an artistic choice would not be surprising given Blake’s general willingness to experiment. Still, this hesitation was somewhat regrettable, as perhaps it partially underestimated the audience’s discipline.
Although Blake’s concert was consistently strong, the most impactful part of the performance came last: The final song before the obligatory encore was a deeply affecting performance of “The Wilhelm Scream,” a cover of a song written by his father. Blake’s voice, accompanied by technically difficult guitar arpeggios and hollow beats, created an atmosphere of intense melancholy, making it a perfect culmination of the show. That moment induced emotional reactions, but the largest takeaway from Blake’s show is perhaps intellectual: his devotion to live performance, enabled by his supreme talent and largely imaginative adaptations, deserves high praise.

Ha Jin has made a career on crafting skillful histories of particular moments in the history of 20th-century China. His most iconic work, “Waiting,” explores the shifts brought on by the Cultural Revolution through the eyes of an army doctor, while “War Trash” explores the brutality of the Korean War from the perspective of a Chinese POW. In recent years, however, Jin has turned away from insular studies of China to focus explicitly on the relationship between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the United States.
While his first book-length exploration of Sino-U.S. interplay, the 2014 spy tale “A Map of Betrayal,” hovered in Jin’s mid-century sweet spot, this month’s journalistic thriller, “The Boat Rocker,” zooms forward to 2005 New York City, giving Jin the nearly impossible task of historicizing a just-barely-bygone era. While Jin occasionally lets the confusing ethical positions of his megalomaniacal-muckraker protagonist Feng Danlin cloud the author’s critique of the Bush years, Jin’s vision of the relationship between Chinese-American media, the War on Terror, and the rise of Internet-reputation provides a fascinating origin story for the turbulent East-West dynamics of the social media age.
“The Boat Rocker” opens with a jolt: Danlin, a reporter for the America-based, anti-censorship Chinese media outlet GNA, discovers that his ex-wife, Yan Haili, has finally followed through on her desire to publish—exclusively in China, and thus outside of the fact-checking gaze of most American journalists—a pseudo-memoir about her second marriage to a successful Wall Street banker. In a bizarre turn, however, she has fabricated the banker’s death in one of the Twin Towers on 9/11, leveraging the made-up tragedy to help the book be taken more seriously in the Chinese press. Despite the conflict of interest, Danlin’s bosses at GNA convince their columnist to investigate the memoir’s potential links to the Chinese government, which they believe may be bankrolling the project to curry favor with the Bush administration. Sure enough, Danlin discovers that the “lightweight romance novel” is receiving ridiculous accolades in Party publications, which suggest that the book may receive a Nobel Prize (a lifetime achievement award, Danlin incredulously carps!) consideration.
Jin frenetically introduces the players in the conspiracy: Danlin’s suspicious boss, the real-life second husband Larry (still alive), and several corrupt Chinese publishers. Danlin wades through the muck with as much bias as possible, writing columns that highlight the toxicity he feels towards his wife, who abandoned him seven years earlier a day after Danlin’s arrival in the U.S. Jin, whose first-person narration as Danlin offers little space for other perspectives, seems to be setting up an intriguing mystery around his narrator’s unreliability: Can we trust Danlin, or is he out for revenge? Jin’s ambiguous treatment of Danlin, which he complicates with revelations of his protagonist’s impotence and misogyny (he refers to Chinese women as having “cringed faces” and usually describes women by their appearance rather than by their intellectual attributes) directs the book’s focus towards his bruised psyche.
For the first half of the book, then, the morality play around Danlin obscures the comparatively quaint political historicizing in which Jin is engaged. Yes, there is the 9/11 lie—to which Danlin takes special offense given his opposition to the Iraq War—but otherwise it just seems surreal that nobody has smart phones. The Internet flame wars between Haili and Danlin never reach a fever pitch, and Danlin’s wonder at the Web’s ability to “give every individual a voice” seems blasé compared to his anger at his wife. Geopolitical and technological issues initially take a backseat to Danlin’s self-righteousness and the forcefulness of Haili’s defenses.The battle is intriguing, but the potential to delve into 2005 remains mostly unrealized until later in the novel.
Initially, the larger importance of the U.S.-China relations of 2005 are further buried—sometimes frustratingly so—by the satellite setting; besides a brief interlude in Berlin, the book takes place entirely in New York, while the hubbub generated by Danlin and Haili’s press war happens in an unseen China that the reader only hears about second-hand from publishers, businessmen, and diplomats who fly in to tell Danlin how much trouble he’s in. Danlin’s distance, however, becomes the very point of Jin’s 2005, particularly as it becomes clear that no deus ex machina or shoot-out will decide a victor. At one point, Danlin learns he has been selected by an online Chinese poll as one of the Top 100 Public Intellectuals, despite the fact that he lives abroad, makes no money, and hasn’t been to China since his arrival in the U.S. The incomplete Internet connectivity of the mid-aughts gives the fight a certain dullness and unknowability that allows Jin to start favoring the philosophical over the pot-boiler as the plot progresses. By the book’s end, the frenetic set-up has given way to dialogue-heavy debates between Danlin, Haili, and their friends and colleagues over what exactly they believe to be the purpose of the Internet, censorship, and their own personal roles in revealing the all-powerful ability of the U.S. to encourage greed.
The book’s kernels of truth concern the arguments that consume our society: between net neutrality and hypnotic propaganda, American cynicism and Chinese sensationalism, and the increasingly obvious reality to both sides that posting the wrong thing online can end you. Jin is astonishingly disciplined in his crafting of character and prose, even if “The Boat Rocker” takes an unexpected yet exhilarating left turn away from thriller territory towards a philosophical reckoning with the recent past.

Pusha T got the Carly Rae Jepsen treatment last year.  Like her, he released a critically acclaimed sophomore effort , “King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude,”  that commercially flopped (much like her “Emotion”). Coming off his first album as president of the record label GOOD Music, Pusha set about releasing a string of singles in promotion of his upcoming album, “King Push” (not to be confused with “King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude”). The first of these singles was the Jay Z-assisted “Drug Dealers Anonymous,” which is probably most notable for its brilliant use of a sample of Tomi Lahren bashing Beyoncé’s Super Bowl halftime show performance by attempting to use Jay Z’s drug history to discredit her as a role model.
“H.G.T.V.” is the second single in this run, and it’s quintessential Pusha, with his trademark wordplay, coke references, and braggadocio. The Mike WiLL Made-It-produced beat is minimal, with little more than a drum line and a faint bass. This song is notorious, however, for its scattered Drake disses, like, “It’s too far gone when the realest ain’t real / I walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain’t real / These n***** Call of Duty cause their killings ain’t real/ With a questionable pen so the feeling ain’t real.” Here, “It’s too far gone ” probably references Drake’s mixtape “So Far Gone”; “Walk amongst the clouds” references the cover of Drake’s album “Nothing Was the Same”; and the “questionable pen” hints at accusations of Drake using ghostwriters. This is masterful wordplay; Pusha T is at his best with this sort of brag rap that puts down any foes in his crosshairs.  As far as subliminal Drake diss tracks go (and in 2016, there are a ton), this one’s a little bit harder than the average, but Pusha T is generally a harder rapper.
With that being said, “H.G.T.V.” isn’t a track that especially stands out, acting as a vehicle to demonstrate Pusha’s lyrical skill and not much more.  However, its highs are great, like the line “Rap’s John Grisham / I can paint the picture with the words if you listen.”  As one of the greatest coke-rappers ever—a genre that’s all about imagery—Pusha T’s claim here is pretty hard to dispute.

During the late summer and fall, conversations on campus often center on a single topic: recruiting. Some of the recruiting conversations focus on the mundane, such as interview attire or etiquette. However, many of the conversations revolve around an entirely different issue: the idea that going into the corporate world makes one a sellout. Many students who decide to pursue finance or consulting jobs preface their conversations by assuring their friends that: “I won’t become one of them.” They sharply criticize the immorality of the jobs they are pursuing, and openly state that corporate jobs conflict with their values. As the conversation slowly winds down, the individual often states something along the lines of: “I can’t believe I gave in…” and the friend sadly nods his or her head in compassion.
This is the dark myth of the corporate world: that it is devoid of morals or values, and that individuals who pursue corporate jobs are shameful sellouts. This myth rests on dubious assumptions.
There are certainly legitimate and serious criticisms of corporate America. Some corporations and corporate practices have undoubtedly ruined lives. But many of the criticisms that I have heard articulated are unfounded.
One reason college students consider themselves sellouts if they pursue corporate jobs is because they believe that they are pursuing jobs about which they are not passionate. Many students bemoan that they are turning their backs on the disciplines they love. They feel as though they have found their one, true passion in anthropology, history, or physics, and that they will not find fulfillment anywhere else.
While many college students have strong affinities for certain fields of study, most 21-year-olds can’t possibly know the extent or ultimate direction of their passions. Many undergraduates have had little experience in the work force, and have not yet had the opportunity to explore different careers and to see how and where they might blossom.
Furthermore, many students trumpet their distaste for corporate jobs before they even understand what exactly these jobs entail. Students claim that they are sellouts if they end up in this line of work because they thought that they would pursue jobs that “do good”: jobs at non-profits or in public service. Many students criticize finance because they profess that they have no desire to "help the rich get richer,” but these platitudes ignore the multiplicity of jobs that are available in the financial sector.
In fact, corporate jobs often effect change for the better and advance society just as non-profit jobs can. They help finance new ventures, lower the cost of products, and save faltering companies—often protecting thousands of jobs. Take, for example, the case of American Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. The company’s financial situation forced it to notify over 100,000 workers that their pensions could be affected; American Airlines also warned 11,000 workers that they could lose their jobs. However, with help from firms such as McKinsey & Co., American Airlines emerged solvent from the crisis. Without the help of corporate America, the results might have been far more dire.
Many students also claim that they are sellouts because a huge factor in their decisions to pursue these jobs is the salary, which they believe makes their decision inherently wrong. The sole reason to pursue a career should not be economic. But it is naïve to pretend that money isn’t a significant and legitimate factor to consider when deciding what career to pursue. To pursue a career that provides financial security for oneself or for one's family doesn’t make one a sellout. Moreover, corporate jobs allow individuals to be involved in philanthropic pursuits and to invest in major entrepreneurial projects. For example, after quitting his Wall Street job in 1994, Jeff Bezos used his own money to start Amazon—a company that has revolutionized Internet retail since its founding.
Of all the criticisms of the corporate world, the claim that I find perhaps the most problematic is that people who work in the corporate world are immoral. I have heard both students and Harvard faculty describe bankers as the villains of modern society—and as liars and cheats who will do anything to increase their paychecks. This description is so widely accepted that after recruiting events or individual conversations, students often express shock at how seemingly nice a recruiter was. This depiction of the corporate word is a sophomoric attack on an entire industry based on the actions of a number of individuals. There are both moral and immoral people in every field and profession (including academia, the clergy, and politics, to name a few) and it is disingenuous to claim that those who are immoral end up in the business world.
Many students have a deep aversion to corporate jobs based on personal experiences or extensive research, which may well be justified. But many of the blanket statements about corporate America that I have heard on campus are misinformed. So let’s stop propagating the dark myth of the corporate world.

After discovering clear misrepresentation in the event attendance numbers that dictate the size of grants to student groups last semester, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee plans to launch a study to survey attendance. Representatives will begin to attend a random selection of UC-funded events in order to measure attendance and compare actual figures with projections on grant applications.
We commend the UC’s attempt to obtain more concrete data through this study in order to gauge the size of the discrepancy between actual and projected attendance. This process will only shed light on student organizations’ behavior, and will help the UC make sure it is not rewarding dishonesty, especially since the  current process of granting may even disadvantage groups that are honest in their projections.
In addition to collecting data, the UC should step back and take heed of the larger issue behind inflated event attendance projections: the lack of security in funding that many student organizations face, which is only exacerbated by grant cuts exacted by the UC when it exceeds its weekly budget. The potential for cuts comes on top of  the small per-student estimates used to allocate UC money for food, transportation, and speaker or instructor fees, estimates that oftentimes prove insufficient for student organizations.
These incentives may have created an inflation-cut positive feedback loop of sorts, in which student organizations who inflate numbers may cause the UC to exceed its weekly budget on a regular basis, leading to inescapable cuts across the board for all non-collaborating student groups who applied for grants at that time. As a result, those organizations who were initially honest in their attendance projections—and hence needed the entirety of their allocation—could have insufficient funds and start to inflate numbers to curtail the impact of cuts, initiating another insidious cycle of inflation.
In order to discourage projected attendance inflation, we encourage the UC to consider raising its allocations per student to a more realistic level so that student organizations will be able to report honestly. In light of the reality that this issue could also, in part, be due to a sole reliance on grants, the Finance Committee should consider setting up annual operational budgets as another source of secure funding that all organizations will be able to rely on. Whatever alternatives it seeks out, a revaluation of the current grant policy is necessary to curtail the unpredictable nature of indiscriminate cuts to which student groups’ funding is susceptible.
Potential long-term solutions may go beyond a re-structuring of the grants process. UC leaders in the past have brought attention to the disparity between the $75 Harvard students pay and the higher activities fees at other schools, and have vied  for increased funding. Given the exaggerations and misrepresentations to which organizations are resorting, the UC and the College administration should reevaluate the funding constraints imposed by our student activities fee. Ultimately, we hope the current UC’s efforts will help restore some sanity to the grant process, and that future reforms will create a more stable underlying system of student group financing.

In my experience, when people think of Harvard, they expect success.
Whenever I tell someone I go to Harvard, that someone imagines me to be on the way to becoming part of a successful elite who have achieved much and acquired power like numerous other Harvard graduates. Or, similarly, when a professor gets to put Harvard on their CV, it’s hard not to believe that they have achieved some success in academia given that Harvard produces the most Nobel laureates in the world.
But considering many of the issues and recent events facing Harvard today, I think that our expectation of success and ability to create elites have become fragile.
For one, Harvard’s global ranking status has taken hits. Harvard has dropped in rankings of universities in the world according to Times Higher Education, going from first in 2011 to sixth in 2016. And over the past few years Harvard has been hemorrhaging talent to other universities like Stanford, not to speak of the number of talented professors that have turned down offers from Harvard. Comparing Harvard’s past to where it is today begs a question: Why are we losing out to other top-tier universities? To me, it seems that such losses coincide with rising concerns about a fragmented community, and I don’t think that this is accidental.
In the past month alone, students have had to make do without dining halls as centers of house life; Harvard’s administration has decided to create a task force to investigate diversity and inclusivity on campus; and The Crimson has published multiple op-eds concerned with home and community. These events and many others fit into the larger narrative that the University has especially struggled with since President Faust took the reins: namely, that there is supposed to be One Harvard.
These concerns of unifying Harvard are also based on a concern that Harvard is losing its ability to set up its students for success. The University campaign to create One Harvard is motivated by the idea that the disparate parts of Harvard working in unison will make for a greater, more successful whole. And those who are concerned with a fragmented community—whether caused by a lack of initiative on the part of students to create meaningful relationships, or by a strike that has split dining hall workers, students, and the administration into different camps—also implicitly identify the need for consistent and unified support systems in success.
Looking at Harvard’s past, it seems like a homogeneity that is conducive to success has contributed to a large part of its achievements. The fact that many of Boston’s WASP-y Brahmin class sent their boys to Harvard made for a school composed of people with similar values and goals. And with these similar values and goals, it’s easy to imagine how a united Harvard was able to rise as a bastion of success and excellent education.
Nowadays, our expectation for Harvard to breed an elite is tempered by the fact that it is much more diverse in terms of class, gender, ethnicity, and geographic location, a fact that we can attribute to a globalized world governed by global standards that requires Harvard to look far and wide for the best. And to assimilate such a diverse group of students under the banner of Harvard takes much more work than simply admitting them, as some students have realized. It has not been until recently that Harvard has decided to fund an orientation program to help incoming freshmen from under-resourced high schools become accustomed to Harvard.
In some ways, one could say our concerns about a lack of community in a place that creates elites are not all that different from the concerns of those who have committed themselves to Making America Great Again.
The story I have just told of Harvard seems to parallel a story told of the U.S., where a small country quickly rose to power and is now facing problems in its ability to keep a diverse nation together and thriving. Trump supporters seem to believe such a narrative, as they have been shown to believe that America has declined since the 1950’s, whatever their reasons. And as I have tried to explain, such a narrative can easily apply to Harvard.
Regardless of whether or not Trump supporters are right about America’s decline, or whether or not I am right in pointing out potential signs of Harvard’s decline, they are concerned with the same fragility of success in the country that we are concerned with when we talk of community and unity at Harvard.
However, to return to strength doesn’t mean we have to resort to Harvard’s old ways when it was male and white. In fact, the world we live in today requires us to think of new ways to unify an increasingly diverse set of students to set them up for success.

Graduate student union effort spokesperson Jack M. Nicoludis raised concerns about an administrator's email that said Harvard would release information on students eligible to vote in the upcoming union election to the National Labor Relations Board and Harvard Graduate Students-United Auto Workers.
That email, sent by Office of Labor and Employee Relations Director Paul R. Curran to all eligible students, detailed the NLRB’s subpoena of student information in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that Harvard was “legally required to notify students that their information would be shared,” because some of the information requested is protected by FERPA.
According to FERPA rules, universities do not need to individually notify students about the release of directory information, which includes names, date of birth, phone number, address, email, and department of study.
However, some of the information required by the subpoena goes “beyond what is publicly available through the University directory,” Cowenhoven wrote, namely the request for student employment positions such as teaching fellows and course or research assistants as well as the school or department in which they work.
Nicoludis said the “unnecessary legal jargon” in Curran’s email served only to complicate a regular part of union elections.
“By citing unfamiliar statutes in detail and then writing that you ‘have the right to object to the subpoena and release of your personal information’ makes a normal and essential step in all union certification elections appear oppositional and invasive,” Nicoludis wrote in an email.
Cowenhoven wrote, “We are working to communicate clearly on these important issues so that students, who are eligible to vote and would be impacted by unionization, know their information will be shared and how they may object, should they choose to do so.”
In the pre-election agreement signed by Curran and graduate student union organizers, both parties agreed that Harvard “is required by [FERPA] to give notice that non-directory information about them will be provided to third parties, pursuant to a lawfully-issued subpoena.”
When a union election is held at a university, it is normal for a subpoena to be issued requesting student information. Providing lists of eligible voters is “necessary to a fair and free election,” Nicoludis wrote.
“Unfortunately, the university uses this language to make it seem like the union is gaining access to personal information, where in reality this is a very normal process that happens in all unionization efforts and is required by the NLRB,” Nicoludis wrote.
Universities do not have to notify students individually if and when they release personally identifiable information to a third party, but they do need to notify students that a subpoena was issued for the information—barring one issued by law enforcement—like the one issued from the NLRB.
According to a Department of Education spokesperson, there is some leeway on notification method depending on how many students have to be reached.
“If the number of students about which the university received a subpoena for their records is very large, say in the hundreds or thousands, the Department has advised that notification could be made in a more general way that would reasonably reach the student (email, newspaper, website, or combination of methods),” the spokesperson wrote in an email.
Cowenhoven wrote that Harvard was "aware of other opportunities to notify students but felt that email was the best and most direct channel through which we could be reasonably assured that students would be informed."
Like Harvard, Cornell University also individually notified its students that it was required under court order to provide their information when its graduate students moved forward with their own unionization process. In its pre-election agreement signed in May, Cornell and its graduate student union effort agreed that “notice, which has been vetted and approved by the Union” must be “given to all affected students whose information will be released.”
Cornell’s Senior Vice Provost and Dean of the Graduate School Barbara A. Knuth, who signed the letter to students, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the wording of the agreement was carefully crafted.
“Based on the consultation of Cornell’s legal counsel (who is expert in FERPA) and the Union’s legal counsel, the Agreement wording was developed and agreed to by both parties, to address the Union’s request for information including directory and non-directory information,” Knuth wrote.
“We believe that every student who would be voting in the union representation election (and who would be in the collective bargaining unit should an election result in favor of union representation) should be fully-informed regarding issues associated with union representation,” she added.

Transportation specialists and Cambridge officials say they are optimistic about the implications of new executive orders the state and Boston city governments released this past Thursday that will allow autonomous vehicles to be tested in the state.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh appointed new groups of officials—at the state and municipal level respectively—who will direct the implementation of regulations for the testing and pilot stages of self-driving vehicles.
Bryan Reimer, an MIT research scientist who is also the associate director of the school’s New England University Transportation Center, said the orders can help encourage scientific innovation in Massachusetts.
“Massachusetts has traditionally had a very rich history in the robotics area,” he said. “If [Massachusetts] wants to be a future leader in both robotics and transportation, then testing here in the Commonwealth is going to be crucial.”
Cambridge officials, meanwhile, said the city has more work to do in light of the initiative.
“We haven’t done a tremendous lot yet in Cambridge with autonomous vehicles. It’s a discussion that we need to have with manufacturers,” said Joseph Barr, Cambridge’s director of traffic, parking, and transportation.
Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem Mazen said he has been working with the Boston city government to promote Cambridge as a testing site for these vehicles.
“We’ve been talking about how we can be part of this pilot, to be on the up-and-coming of it all,” he said.
John Foote, a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said Boston can build upon other city’s experiences for this initiative.
“Most people believe that the first application of autonomous vehicles will be in fleets such as taxi fleets similarly to what’s being tested in Singapore and Pittsburgh,” he said.
In addition to technological opportunities, Reimers said automated vehicles can lead to safer streets in Cambridge. Local politicians have recently prioritized road safety, including passing new resolutions on bike safety in September.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three experts in conservation science discussed conservation strategies that both protect biodiversity and encourage economic development at a Harvard University Center for the Environment panel Thursday evening.
More than 100 students, professors, and graduate students attended the event. The panel was held in the Northwest Building as part of a seminar series entitled “Ecological Systems in the Anthropocene.”
The panel included former Chief Scientist of the World Wildlife Fund Jon Hoekstra; Peter Karieva, director of the Institute of Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles; and Conservation International Executive Vice President M. Sanjayan. The event was moderated by Elizabeth M. Wolkovich, a professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
Hoekstra pointed to rising extinction rates, which have “increased more than one hundred fold” as an example of a decline in global biodiversity.
“Not only are we losing species at unprecedented rates, but we are also losing the abundance of wildlife and the amount of nature we have,” he said.
Karieva said this loss comes at a price for the general public as well.
“There is a loss we all see in the natural world,” he said. “A loss of habitat, a loss of species, a loss of the opportunity to interact with nature.”
The panelists discussed the main threats to maintaining biodiversity, including habitat degradation caused by development and pollution. They proposed combining development, sustainability, and conservation goals as solutions to these challenges.
Hoekstra said conservationists should focus on integrating environmental protection into building projects, instead of trying to restore natural environments to previous states.
“Conservation is sometimes too backwards looking. We need to ask: ‘how do we bring as much nature with us as we move to the future?” he said. “You can have a successful juxtaposition of human and environmental interests in the long term.”
The panel also discussed the issue of inspiring change in the face of economic, political, and social barriers.
Karieva said the issues of conservation today need to be communicated at a more general level to inspire action.
“Scientific data and science doesn’t motivate. It’s the solution to the problem that motivates,” he said.
Audience member Anne H. Opel ’17 said she enjoyed the panel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum discussed the vulnerability of U.S. election systems to cyber threats Thursday.
Cyber attacks and leaks orchestrated by hackers have been a source of significant media attention during the 2016 campaign season. Earlier this month, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other American political groups. Michael L. Sulmeyer, director of the Kennedy School’s Cyber Security Project, led the conversation on the safety of the election system at the Institute of Politics.
Pamela Smith, president of Verified Voting, a non-partisan NGO that promotes the transparency and accuracy of elections, opened the forum with an overview of technology in U.S. elections. According to Smith, technology used in elections, such as voting machines or electronic paper ballot scanners, is vulnerable to hackers.
Benjamin Buchanan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cyber Security Project, followed up by recounting the Russian hacking of Ukraine’s elections in May. Though Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service succeeded in thwarting Russia’s attempts to alter vote counts that appeared on constituents’ television screens, Russia succeeded in tampering with the vote counts that appeared on the country’s elections website.
Smith also described two hacker breaches in the voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois, which showed that the attacks were not limited to foreign countries. According to Smith, while a foreign power altering vote counts to the point of changing the winner remains improbable, the vote count could still be altered.
“This is not so much theoretical at this point. This is happening,” Smith said.
Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, agreed on the probability of a breach in election security. He said the motives of potential hackers would not be to ensure the election of a specific candidate, but would be to “unwind the very idea of our election, of free and fair democracy.”
Smith cautioned voters against the belief that the upcoming presidential election is rigged, as the auditing of paper ballots makes any discrepancies in vote count temporary. She closed the forum by urging listeners to vote regardless of risks they perceive to election security.
“Have faith. Go vote.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company employees accused the University’s troubled investment arm of setting artificially low benchmarks and overcompensating top managers, criticizing their employer extensively in a 2015 internal review, Bloomberg reported Thursday.
The 78-page PowerPoint review, compiled by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company and never released publicly, examined what it calls the “performance paradox” of Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment: While the University has lagged behind peers for years, it has frequently surpassed its own internal benchmarks. Fiscal year 2016 marked the first year since FY 2009 that HMC did not beat its overall internal goal, returning a “disappointing” negative 2 percent and coming in second-to-last in the Ivy League.
HMC employees did not mince words in describing their employer to McKinsey, characterizing the culture of HMC as “lazy, fat and stupid” and centered on “stable, rather than smart, capital,” according to Bloomberg.
The McKinsey report, which studied fiscal years 2009 through 2014, blamed easily attainable benchmarks—so-called “‘slow rabbits’”—for creating a culture of complacency at HMC, Bloomberg reported.
“This is the only place I’ve seen where people can negotiate the benchmark they get compensated on,” read one “representative quote” from an HMC employee in the McKinsey review.
“There were so many side deals cut during the crisis – bad stuff moved out of portfolios and benchmarks adjusted – individual performance bears little resemblance to fund performance and we somehow seem OK with that,” read another quote, according to Bloomberg.
Starting in 2017, “compensation paid to internal investment managers will tie a meaningful share of variable compensation to HMC’s overall performance,” HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli wrote in an emailed statement.
Due to the firm’s poor performance in FY 2016, Guadagnoli continued, “current and former investment managers will forfeit compensation that was held back in prior years.”
Elsewhere in the review, McKinsey warned that Harvard’s endowment—currently the world’s largest—could be outsized by Yale’s within 20 years, according to Bloomberg. Many financial experts see the Yale Investment Office, which returned a dominating 3.4 percent on its endowment in FY 2016, as a potential model for how Harvard should structure its management company. Since FY 2006, Yale has outpaced Harvard every year except two.
“Harvard shouldn’t stand for mediocrity, but that’s where we’re heading if this continues,” one HMC employee told McKinsey.
Still, the review was not entirely critical: McKinsey noted that riskier alternative assets like real estate and natural resources had performed strongly over the period studied, though they were judged by a “less aggressive” benchmark compared to peer institutions. In FY 2016, however, natural resources took a downward turn, returning negative 10.2 percent against a benchmark of 1.4 percent.
According to Bloomberg, McKinsey also advised expanding HMC’s internal trading team. Instead, the firm recently reduced the size of its internal public equities team, and University President Drew G. Faust has indicated that more investing teams may be outsourced on the basis of performance in the future.
Former Columbia investment chief N.P. Narvekar will be tasked with turning HMC around when he arrives as its next CEO this December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of students is calling for the cancellation of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players' show “The Mikado,” sharpening previous criticisms of the play after watching a rehearsal Wednesday.
The students had originally planned a protest of the production’s opening show Friday night, arguing “The Mikado” features exaggerated stereotypes about Japanese culture. But now, after some students attended the Wednesday rehearsal, they are urging the Gilbert and Sullivan Players to shut down the production, claiming that the production does not adequately grapple with how the show historically depicted race and gender.
In a three-page Google document posted on the Facebook event advertising the protest, George S. Qiao ’18, the event’s main organizer, wrote “it is too late for this show to save itself from propagating the extensive dangerous stereotypes it displays.”
“While in the past I have refrained from pursuing extreme action because I had not yet seen the play, having now watched it and discovered the depths of its potential harm, I now feel comfortable calling for the play to be shut down,” Qiao wrote.
“The Mikado,” a comedic opera written in 1884, is set in a fictional 19th-century Japanese town and features stereotypical and exaggerated depictions of Japanese culture. The play was intended to satirize British political culture and bureaucracy.
Kathleen Zhou ’17, president of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players, said the group still plans to stage the show. Zhou added, however, that she sees some of Qiao’s criticisms as “valid.”
“We have chosen… to work within a problematic framework,” Zhou said. “I don’t think we think it’s perfect.”
The Google document details Qiao’s criticisms of the show, specifically what he characterizes as transphobia and a failure to engage with critical elements of Japanese history.
“[T]he Players seem to have attempted to remove confrontations of race altogether. Japananese (sic) culture isn’t spoken about even once,” Qiao wrote in the document.
Zhou argued that the show portrays Japanese culture in its “aesthetics.” The Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ adapted rendition takes place in a “Las Vegas themed Oriental hotel” and features similar characters and elements as the original.
“It’s a twist on the perversion of Japanese culture that’s in the original show,” Zhou said. “It’s a twist on Orientalism in general.”
Qiao said he thought that one traditionally female character, played in the Gilbert and Sullivan production by a male actor, is a transphobic portrayal because of its harmful depiction of transgender femininity.
“[T]he result is something incredibly harmful to perceptions of trans people,” Qiao wrote.
He also lambasted what he considered portrayals of “violence and gendered oppression in the production.” Qiao wrote that, in his opinion, men harass and objectify several female characters in some scenes.
“Like the historical racism in the play, the historical sexism and gender violence also needs to be critically addressed and interrogated. This has been overlooked,” Qiao wrote.
Zhou said that although the show does portray sexism, “there’s a big difference between representing and supporting that.” Rather,  Zhou said Gilbert and Sullivan’s rendition of  “The Mikado” seeks to bring such issues into the public conscience.
“No production can be perfect,” she said.
The protest of “The Mikado” is scheduled for tomorrow evening outside of Agassiz Theater, 30 minutes before the start of the production. Thirty-nine people indicated on the event’s Facebook page they planned to attend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of hockey season typically evokes thoughts of falling leaves and falling temperatures. Not this year.
The times, they are a-changin’. After all, it’s 2016, a year that’s proven time and time again that anything is possible. Running for President. Selling phones without headphone jacks. Even dropping the puck in the depths of Arizona.
As for the two teams set to face off, they’re a-changin’ just the same. In one corner stands a recent title contender looking to cope with the departure of its two most prominent members. In the other stands a recent title winner looking to re-establish itself on a brand new stage.
The first account tells the tale of the challenger, the Harvard men’s hockey team—reigning co-champion of the Ivy League and runner-up in the ECAC. Coach Ted Donato ’91 will have his first chance to unleash his new-look lineup this weekend, as the Crimson begins its pursuit of a third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance.
As for the recent champions, those would be the Arizona State Sun Devils. ASU assembled its best team in program history three years ago when the Sun Devils practically ran the table at the club level, producing a 38-2-0 record and a national championship.
But that was only the appetizer. Six months after bringing home the trophy, the Sun Devils announced they were ready for a promotion. They were ready for Division I hockey.
So here we are. Two years removed from the big reveal, ASU is now just six games into its inaugural Division I season and already hosting Harvard—a program steeped in tradition—in its own barn.
Sort of, anyway. Arizona State plans to have its own rink in a few years. For now, it splits home games between Glendale’s Gila River Arena—home of the Arizona Coyotes—and Oceanside Ice Arena, a community rink on campus. Thus, on some nights, capacity is 18,000; other nights, it’s 800.
This particular weekend, Harvard will try both rinks on for size. The Crimson and Sun Devils will meet in Glendale on Friday night, then run it back Saturday night at an unsurprisingly sold-out Oceanside Ice Arena.
“Their on-campus arena, which will be jam packed in a small little area, [will] be a pretty great environment as far as the level of excitement in the arena,” Donato said.
“The trip is going to be awesome,” newly appointed co-captain Devin Tringale added. “I think it’s really exciting to add another team to Division I hockey…and we’re excited to be part of their first official season, so there’s a lot of excitement there.”
Thus far, Arizona State has played exclusively ranked opponents—a trend that will continue at least through this weekend. After finishing last season ranked 10th, the Crimson heads into its season opener listed at 13th in both the USCHO and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls.
To sustain that ranking this season, Harvard will need to prove it can generate offense without Jimmy Vesey ’16 and Kyle Criscuolo ’16. Only time will tell, but Donato does have a number of pieces he can utilize.
New co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, the last man standing from the Crimson’s once perennially dominant first line, will be joined atop the depth chart by sophomores Ryan Donato and Lewis Zerter-Gossage, per Ted Donato. Complementing the youth on the top line will likely be an all-senior group of Sean Malone, Tyler Moy, and Luke Esposito on line two.
“We’d like to think that they’ll be pushing each other in a positive way so that we can have two first lines—a 1 and 1A—whatever way you want to look at it,” Ted Donato said. “We’re going to need guys to step up, and we’re going to need our best players to be our best players every night. And those guys certainly fit that mold.”
Those two lines will have a chance to have field days against Arizona State (1-5-0), which is still getting its toes wet in the world of Division I hockey. Yet, while the Sun Devils continue to be underdogs night in and night out, they have already knocked off a ranked opponent in Air Force and pushed No. 6 Notre Dame to the brink in South Bend. Factor in any potential opening weekend rust for Harvard, and again, anything could be possible.
“I remain a hockey coach, so I’m always concerned that hey, we don’t know as much about this program,” Ted Donato said. “This is a dangerous game. They’re playing games seven and eight. But I think right now we’ve got our program to a point so that we should be really focused on ourselves.”
“There’ll be no excuses on our end,” he added. “There are no silver linings other than us having success out of the gate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having dropped all of its three Ivy League games so far, Dartmouth football would require a perfect storm of events to have any shot at all at contending for the championship.
While the Big Green’s title hopes have been all but dashed, the reigning co-champion can still play an important role down the stretch—the role of spoiler.
Fueled by last year’s 14-13 defeat at Harvard Stadium, Dartmouth (3-3, 0-3 Ivy) will attempt to reverse its Ancient Eight fortunes and bump Harvard down in the standings when the Crimson (5-1, 3-0) visits Hanover, N.H. this weekend.
“I don’t want to harp too much on last year, but the way that ended for them, they’re definitely going to have a sour taste in their mouth,” captain Sean Ahern said. “The mentality right now is every game from here on out is the championship week.”
The thorn in the Big Green’s side against conference opponents has been the offense. In those three contests, Dartmouth has tallied an anemic 44 points. Even with a defense that ranks as above-average in the Ivy League, it is a tall task to win games with that offensive output, as evidenced by a 9-7 loss last week to Columbia.
However, it is possible the Big Green could rely almost entirely on its defense to put the first blemish on Harvard’s Ivy League record. Dartmouth has allowed the fewest total points of any Ivy League team in 2016, and Harvard has averaged only 23 points in its last three games.
In program history, Harvard has only lost six games when scoring 30 or more points. However, much like last year’s meeting between the Crimson and the Big Green, a low-scoring, defensive-dominated battle is more likely.
“The team we know we’re going to face is the team that has beaten three scholarship schools,” coach Tim Murphy said. “The team that beat a UNH team that’s undefeated in the CAA. The team that beat Towson that three years ago played in the national championship game.”
Injuries have plagued Harvard this season, specifically within the linebacker corps and the offensive line. This week’s faceoff against Dartmouth, combined with the Penn game looming in the near future, will define the Crimson’s season. Accordingly, Murphy cannot afford to hold many, if any, starters out of action.
“We’ve had a lot of linebackers go out, but it’s next man up,” Ahern said. “Get those guys ready to play, and you’re expected to do your job when you’re in there.”
Harvard’s injury list has grown shorter recently, and several key contributors are back in action. Sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley returned last week against Princeton and hauled in six catches for 82 yards. The Sacramento, Calif. native has yet to record a touchdown this year after finding the end zone six times last year, so he is due for a score or two in the coming weeks.
Senior quarterback Joe Viviano also took the field against the Tigers after sitting out for the Holy Cross game. Viviano uncharacteristically scuffled through this contest, as he was picked off three times and fumbled once. In his first four games, he did not turn the ball over a single time.
Princeton’s run defense severely curtailed Viviano, holding him to 19 yards on a staggering 23 carries, and the Big Green’s staunch defense could pose a similar threat to the Berwyn, Pa. native on Saturday. Look for the Crimson to run a lot of pass plays, especially with Shelton-Mosley’s reintegration into the offense and sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott’s breakout performance last week.
In the last 12 meetings between Harvard and Dartmouth, the Crimson has emerged victorious in each one. Harvard has a perfect record in its last 11 road trips to Hanover as well.
Though historical records and statistics from the current year would both point toward a Crimson triumph over the Big Green this week, the intangibles inherent in college football make this matchup as much of a toss-up as any this season.
“It’s homecoming,” Murphy said. “This is the biggest weekend on the calendar in Hanover N.H. every other year. It's going to be the Alamo for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams will visit Princeton, N.J. on Saturday to compete in the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Racing for the Ancient Eight crown, the two teams will attempt to end a 30-year title drought.
Led by junior Courtney Smith, the women’s team looks competitive for this year’s gold medal. In their last meet, the Crimson women placed 15th overall in the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational, racing against some of the top teams in the country with Smith coming in an impressive sixth place. Freshman teammate Lisa Tertsch placed 57th.
For their efforts, Smith was named HepsTrack.com Women’s Runner of the Week, and Tersch earned the same site’s Women’s Co-Rookie of the Week award.
In the most recent USTFCCCA poll, Harvard ranks 29th in the nation and 14th for the Northeast Region. In the Saucony Flo50 rankings, meanwhile, the Crimson stands at a strong No. 14 while Smith ranks No. 20 in the nation as an individual.
Earlier this season, three of the Ivy League teams got a preview of the competition in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet. Running on the same course as Saturday’s championships, Smith claimed the individual gold in the 5,000 meter run. However, Yale claimed second through seventh place as well as the overall victory. Junior Elianna Shwayder was the eighth runner to cross the finish at the H-Y-P meet, guaranteeing Harvard’s overall placement ahead of Princeton.
“The meet this weekend is different from HYP because all the Ivy League teams are there and it's a much more serious meet,” Smith said. “I have a lot more training and good workouts under my belt, so I'm hoping to be able to improve on my performance from last time.”
At the 2015 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, the Crimson women’s cross country team left with a seventh-place finish. Smith placed third at the meet, behind returning champion Elizabeth Bird of Princeton. Shwayder placed 25th, followed by sophomore Kathryn Gillespie at 27th. Despite the unimpressive finish, the team went on to place sixth at the NCAA Regional Championships.
Despite Princeton’s 2015 victory, the team returns only one of its top three finishers, while Harvard returns all three. If the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet is any indication, the Bulldogs are the clear favorite. However, a strong performance by the Crimson might threaten that top spot on the podium.
On the men’s side, the young team enters this weekend without the benefit of much experience. With only one senior on the team, a lot of pressure falls on the group’s underclassmen, who are still adjusting to the intensity of collegiate running.
“Being a young team definitely makes it harder for us,” captain Brandon Price said. “Relying on a lot of underclassmen to perform is less than ideal. However, we've had great performances from each of our underclassmen this year so I know that they have the fitness to excel at Heps. All we need to do is put it all together on the same day.”
Most recently, the team split and traveled to two courses. Led by Price, one group took on the Pre-National Invitational, which is hosted by Indiana State; this same course will feature the NCAA National Championship on November 19. Meanwhile six team members spent the weekend racing on the same course as this weekend’s Ivy Championships.
The men placed third at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet earlier this year with seventh-, eighth- and tenth-place finishes.
Like the women’s team, the men also placed seventh at last year’s Heptagonal Championships, edging out only Brown. Sophomore Austin Gilbert is the lone returning top-40 finisher for the Crimson.
Should they advance, the teams will travel to New York for the NCAA Regional Championships on November 11.
“With cross country, most of the race is decided before the actual race day by the work that's put in through the season in practice,” Smith said. “All the awesome runs and workouts we've done together have prepared us to be ready to race, and on race day, we just have to go out and execute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wearing pink warmups and pink shoelaces to commemorate Harvard’s annual Coaches vs. Cancer game, Harvard ended its eight-game winning streak with a loss to No. 12 Boston College on a rainy night on Berylson Field. The Crimson (10-5, 5-0 Ivy) was ranked four spots below the Eagles, and the game ended with Boston College (10-7, 3-3 ACC) claiming the victory at 4-1.
“I mean it’s always a little disappointing when you lose a game,” captain Kyla Cordrey said. “It ends our little winning streak we had, which is not the biggest of deals.”
The evening began by honoring senior Marissa Balleza, who broke program history for number of career points and goals scored three games ago against Cornell. She entered Thursday’s game with 47 career goals and 109 points. However, despite Balleza’s best efforts with three attempted shots during the match, she was unable to push for a Harvard victory.
Despite out-shooting the Eagles 17 to seven over the entirety of the game, the Crimson was unable to find the back of the net. The one successful Harvard opportunity came by the way of sophomore midfielder Victoria Boylett, who managed to convert a penalty corner in the last few minutes of the game. The goal was assisted by junior midfielder Ellie Cookson, who stopped the short corner and tapped it towards Boylett. The sophomore then proceeded to score her first ever career goal.
However, any hopes of a last-minute resurgence from the Crimson were dashed as the game ended two minutes after.
“I feel like we played very well in the game,” Cordrey said. “It’s just difficult because BC was able to capitalize on a few of our mistakes in the game, and we’ve been working on shortening those. But I think our team played really well in the second half. I just was very proud of how our team was working together – our press was working and it was just very exciting.”
On the other hand, the Eagles were low in shooting opportunities but had a high return rate on their attacking attempts. Twenty-five minutes into the first period, Boston College launched its first successful shot of the game. The Eagles proceeded to score again towards the end of the first period, leaving the score 2-0 at halftime.
“When [BC] scored, the momentum shifted and they started taking advantage of that in the second half of the first half,” sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte said. “But in the second half we came out and played much better, we had a lot of energy, [and] we just weren’t converting our chances. We had so many opportunities in the circle and a lot of shots on goal but we just couldn’t really execute anything and they were able to execute every chance on goal.”
The game also ended sophomore goalkeeper Libby Manela’s 8-0 streak. During the match against BC, Manela registered two saves but was unable to prevent the Eagles from scoring another two goals in the second period. Despite this loss, Manela maintains a lead in the Ivy League in terms of percentage of saves.
Harvard looks to return to Ivy League play next week with a game against Dartmouth. The Crimson boasts a clean winning record of 5-0 and is the only undefeated team in the league. On the other hand, the Big Green (3-10, 0-5 Ivy) has lost its past seven games and the past two games that it has played against Harvard.
“It’s pretty exciting that we’re 5-0 in the Ivies,” Cordrey said. “We had a very large win against Princeton this weekend. I don’t think we’ve beaten them in 22 or 23 years, so that’s just been a very high point in our season. But it means nothing really unless we can close out our last two Ivy games.”
