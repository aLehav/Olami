After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What we’ve been hoping would never happen again just did: Last Thursday, Harvard announced that the Business School would move classes online for all first-year and some second-year MBA students for a week — beginning on September 27 — due to a significant increase in Covid-19 cases at the school. Today marks what is hopefully their last day of online school.
This move appears warranted. The Business School had close to 60 students holed up in isolation when the choice was made. Despite making up 9 percent of Harvard’s student population, HBS students, mostly first-years, accounted for two-thirds of Covid cases among students in September — a development which has been attributed to off-campus social gatherings featuring unmasked intermingling among students. This is 12 times the positivity rate at Harvard’s other schools, including the College, which dealt with its own more modest spike in Covid-19 cases earlier this fall.
This step backward is also a bit scary. We don’t even want to imagine our classes being pushed back online, adding to the pain and disruption this dragging pandemic has already wrought. HBS’s brief move back online is a jarring reminder that Covid-19 is still very much with us. We must take this as an indication that we all need to act responsibly with regard to protecting ourselves and others from Covid-19 — even outside of our classes and official university events, and even when no one is watching.
Harvard’s decision to move classes online for a single week at the Business School is a tactful response, and its tailored nature a tremendous source of relief. The choice is indicative of the University’s capacity for a nimble, proportional action in response to a change in circumstance. It also suggests that we have learned a lot in the past 18 months about how to respond to Covid-19, with a greater understanding of what is necessary to curb a rise in cases: ratcheting up our testing cadences and de-densifying where possible while preserving the residential experience. We’re also pleased with Harvard’s cooperation with local government officials to ensure that this outbreak does not spread into the city of Cambridge or beyond. This week of online classes came after local and state public health officials advised it. All of these short-term measures promise to bring about long-term gains — both for our own peace of mind, and for the actual protection of our community.
Covid-19 requires a constant re-calibration of our behavior. In this new phase of the pandemic, we should anticipate sputters of covid cases even among our highly vaccinated community. When case counts rise, we must adjust. It’s not at all obvious what the correct calibration is, and each person will have a different level of comfort or lack thereof with social interaction. Still, we hope that the ballooning of cases we’ve witnessed at the Business School leads to a greater awareness that Covid-19 is still a threat to our university experiences and health, and might discourage reckless behavior.
We also believe that the situation at the Business School speaks to the continued importance of Covid-19 testing on campus. HBS students were previously testing for Covid weekly; now that cadence has been upped to every other day. The same exact upping of test cadences was mandated for undergraduates after our own Covid spike following move in; since its implementation, cases have been down. The University should consider getting ahead of outbreaks that may crop up in its other schools and institute thrice weekly testing for all Harvard schools if feasible.
The University should also find a way to make it immediately clear to its students and affiliates where the positive cases within Harvard are originating from. Instead of aggregating all graduate students into one category in the school’s public Covid-19 testing dashboard, Harvard should specify which graduate school these positive cases are traversing. This information would allow all students at the University to make more informed decisions about their own conduct and interactions across campus.
As much as we wish it weren’t the case, Covid-19 is still a threat. It’s important that we continue to act responsibly, react quickly, and do all that we can to prevent the spread of the virus on campus — not only for the safety of our community, but also to protect the sanctity of our in-person experience. We wish our peers across the river a good last day of virtual classes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am envious of those who kept a journal throughout their childhood. They have amazing access to the full range of their past: from the quotidian to their most profound experiences. Those of us who did not keep such detailed writings about our lives are left to whatever happens to be stuck in our head. When I look back on high school and cannot recall the general events of one typical day — as opposed to the extraordinary variety — I feel that I do not know myself as I normally am. Of course, this raises the question: Are our true selves revealed at our most jubilant and despondent or at our most mundane? Memory answers a fundamental need in humans: to know oneself. Memory does not simply guide us in avoiding mistakes and making decisions in the present, but it forms us into complete beings.
Imagine what you would be if you had no memory; if the present had a monopoly on existence. One cannot exist without a past. The emptiness of a life without memory extends to the case of any group, whether it be a family, state, civilization, or the collective society of humanity. At its core, this is why we must study history, to answer “Who are we?”
I am a Jew and in many ways, Judaism is a religion of memory. There are three Jewish holidays that capture an idea of remembrance: Rosh Hashanah or Yom Hazikaron, Passover, and Shavuos. On Yom Hazikaron, the Day of Remembrance, we recall creation and judgment. Creation tells us whence we came, and judgment tells us our fate. The fact that we were created externally and not per se means that we owe ourselves to someone else, and thereby have an obligation. Our history is an imperative. On Pesach, we remember our personal exodus from Egypt, which exists in every generation, not just those who physically crossed the Red Sea. God remembered the promise he made to Abraham and all the Jewish people — in the past, present, and future — so we ought to remember the covenant we made with Him. On Shavuos, we remember receiving the present and obligation of Torah. We actively receive the Torah every day. The past occurs all of the time. Our existence is relational, not personal; covenantal, not pragmatic. We must constantly remember our duties to others, and that our relationships exist as an ongoing product of history.
History as a discipline constructs memory for each society and for all of humankind. If, as Americans, we were totally ignorant of our past, the term American would be completely meaningless. I took a class with Professor Mary Lewis on modern French history, throughout which we discussed “les lieux de mémoire” —  roughly translated as “sites of memory” — as symbols, events, people, and anything else that defines what it is to be French. History is at the core of definition and being, what is fixed and what may change, what is particular and what is general. History must be a narrative. It must tell the story of humanity, but it can do so through the specific.
The final project for my class was to add a chapter to “Les Lieux de Mémoire,” a series of essays compiled by Pierre Nora which details the sites of memory that define Frenchness. That project exemplified the deliberate nature of history studied properly. We must put in the effort to remember, and at that, to remember well. We have to ask ourselves who we are, on many different levels, and seek answers where we can find them. To write about something inconsequential would have been a useless contribution to the essay collection, but the inconsequential is different from the mundane. Maybe there is a particular daily habit of the French which so differentiates them from others as to be an essential piece in the book. However, it is for the historian to evaluate this history, and see it in relation to broader questions.
The present is empty. History is the acknowledgment of both the past and the future, of the beginning and the end, and therefore of what is eternal. We must situate history as the basis of the humanities, as it articulates the covenant that makes it possible to ask: What does it mean to be human? In studying history we elevate humans from mere accidents in time and space to a group meaningful in and of themselves. We can only understand who we are and what we will be through knowing what we have been, because that which is essential about us does not change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the story of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’s alleged fraud broke, I wasn’t surprised. Having dozens of classmates from college and business school who embrace the “hustle” of start-up life, I’ve seen my peers do questionable things for their chance to make it big. Holmes’s trial began last month. She faces up to 20 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines. Yet, while the former Silicon Valley star may finally face accountability, the “fake it ‘til you make it” ecosystem that embraced her remains fully intact across spheres of ambition, whether political, social, or entrepreneurial.
Following developments in the Theranos case as a student in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Master’s of Public Policy program, I’ve begun to see similar threads between Holmes’s company, which she built to a $9 billion valuation, and Harvard’s school of government — a country club shrouded in academia.
Elizabeth Holmes promised her board, her investors, and her employees that they would change the world. It’s the underlying premise of the Kennedy School’s mission to do just that. However, the lack of rigor at HKS, at least for its flagship MPP program, is an open secret. While Theranos is accused of criminal conduct, the Kennedy School remains a well-regarded institution. The scale of deceit may be meaningfully different, but these houses of cards share alarmingly similar tactics. Just as Theranos churned out fake blood tests, HKS churns out lofty credentials without merit.
First, Holmes stacked her board with political heavyweights like former Secretary of State George Shultz and former Secretary of Defense General James Mattis. This lent her credibility as a young college dropout trying to build a blood empire. At the Kennedy School, we have another former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. The legitimizing effect is similar for a relatively nascent graduate school, when compared to other types of graduate programs founded in the 1800s. Despite this high-profile veneer, many Kennedy School professors are not remotely comparable to the established academic field-leaders affiliated with Harvard’s esteemed, centuries-old Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Second, Holmes refused to release data that would have exposed her early on, saying that the “Edison” machine, Theranos’s main blood-testing innovation, could not be judged by or held to industry standards. It was in a class of its own. The Kennedy School seems to make the same argument, refusing to allow anyone to peg their MPP program to other similar or substitute graduate programs. HKS does not publish, for example, the average GRE/GMAT scores or the GPA break-downs of admitted students. Most top law schools and business schools provide this information in great detail. While test scores and GPA are certainly only part of a larger picture, it’s concerning that the Kennedy School chooses not to be transparent about these metrics. After all, if these metrics reflected well on the HKS MPP class, it’s hard to believe they would not be publicized. Ultimately, it was data that showed the Edison to be a scam that helped contribute to Theranos’s downfall.
Third, when Holmes realized the Edison simply couldn’t perform, she began running blood tests on her competitor’s machines and using that output to provide clients with their results. After a year in the MPP program — a surface-level exposure to topics like economics, statistics, ethics, and more — we finally spent the last few weeks in a policy analysis class advertised to us as intensive. The entire policy analysis framework taught in the course was written and designed by Eugene Bardach, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. This is no small thing for those who understand the, at times even petty, lengths schools like Harvard go to emphasize their dominance over an academic field.
Customers used Theranos’s blood tests to make critically important decisions about their healthcare. The inaccuracy of the tests led some to make life-altering, harmful, decisions. Employers, voters, and prospective students take signals from Harvard credentials to make decisions about policy and leadership. Local governments hire HKS alumni expecting that the MPP credential holds a certain merit. In reality, from my experience, most students come from dissimilar academic backgrounds compared to adjacent graduate programs, complete AP-level coursework, and get rubber-stamped as policy leaders for completing a program where anything below a B- is failing — and, to my knowledge, almost nobody fails. As we experience a global leadership crisis, it’s important the public not rely on Harvard’s MPP program until the school commits to higher standards of vetting and rigor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2021 at 12:45 p.m.
Almost 18 months after Harvard libraries shuttered their doors, students have eagerly checked out books and frequented their communal study spaces since the libraries reopened in person this fall.
In March 2020, the Harvard Libraries closed in-person services, including borrowing and scan-and-deliver, while retaining digital services and databases. In July 2020, they reopened with limited staff for some services, like book pick up.
Noah D. Dasanaike ’22 said he struggled with the digital format of the libraries’ texts.
“I've never been one to read digitally, so either fiction, nonfiction, I take notes on pen and paper,” Dasanaike said.
Widener Library reopened to affiliates on Aug. 23, while libraries including Lamont Library and Cabot Science Library reopened on Aug. 30. The Harvard University Archives opened on Sept. 7.
“The first thing that I did when I got back on campus is I went to the library after I moved in, to check out a long list of books I had for my thesis,” he added.
Associate University Librarian for Discovery and Access Suzanne Wones wrote in an emailed statement that she believes it is important for individuals to “reunite” with physical books.
“One researcher described how nice it was to ‘reunite’ with physical texts she had been accessing using HathiTrust, and I think that encapsulates what we’ve seen: Users, who could and did access our materials remotely, have returned to the form of access they feel most comfortable with,” she wrote.
Now, students are sharing their appreciation for libraries around campus not just for their research utility, but also for their productive atmospheres.
“It’s nice to be around other folks and familiar faces,” said Arjun A. Akwei ’24, a frequenter of the Adams House and Widener Libraries. “It definitely beats the studying-in-your-room-alone that was the norm last semester when the libraries weren’t open.”
“I think just getting out of my dorm is a really great motivator to me to do work,” Tina Chen ’24 said. “So I’m really happy that libraries are open, just so that I have that specific dedicated space for studying and working.”
“All of you have decided you’re committed to getting some stuff done,” Akwei said about people who study at libraries. “I think that is both uplifting and comforting, and so it’s been a major improvement from last year.”
Wones wrote that excitement has been palpable ever since the library doors first reopened.
“The first student through the Widener turnstiles on the day we opened lifted his arms in a Rocky victory salute,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School researchers found a significant decrease in civilian crime reporting to police following the murder of George Floyd by police in May 2020.
In a working paper, HKS Professor Desmond W. Ang and his colleagues examined detailed data from eight major U.S. cities and found a steep drop in both 911 call volume and the ratio of police-related 911 calls to gunshots in the months following Floyd’s murder.
The paper is part of an effort to “understand how acts of police violence affect civilian trust and cooperation with law enforcement,” Ang wrote in a statement.
Ang and his colleagues chose to study police-related 911 calls as a ratio to gunshots detected to control for underlying changes in crime and potential reporting biases. They obtained data on the amount of gunfire from ShotSpotter, a technology consisting of microphones set in fixed locations throughout a city that alerts law enforcement of the locations and times of gunshots.
“Prior research has looked at how total 911 call volume responds to police brutality, but 911 calls represent some mix of things that are happening in the community and the community's willingness to report those things to police,” Ang wrote.
“To understand what’s really going on with civilian reporting in the wake of a public scandal like the police murder of George Floyd, we need to be able to benchmark 911 calls against some measure of crime in a community that’s not dependent on civilian or police reporting,” Ang continued.
In the week before Floyd’s murder, there were approximately 207 police-related 911 calls for every gunshot, according to the study. In the week following, that figure decreased to fewer than 90.
The paper also found that civilians' decreased engagement with law enforcement occurred across racial and geographic lines.
“We were actually quite surprised at how prevalent these effects were across race and geography,” Ang wrote. “Prior work shows really pronounced effects of police violence on, for example, educational achievement, voting patterns, and mental health, but these effects were concentrated among racial minorities.”
Ang said his and his colleagues' results suggest police need to change how they use force.
“I think the most important policy implication, if you believe community engagement is important for a well-functioning criminal justice system, is that use of force — which you can imagine is intended to be deployed as means of protecting officers and innocent bystanders — may in some cases actually erode policing efficacy and public safety,” Ang wrote.
Restoring public confidence in police will be a steep challenge, Ang noted. Even the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the police officer responsible for Floyd’s death, had little effect on increasing civilian crime reporting, he said.
“I do think the next steps are really to interrogate policies and interventions that could help to rebuild that trust,” Ang wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 500 students violated the College’s residential community compact guidelines over the 2020-21 academic year and the summer of 2021, according to an annual report released by the Dean of Students Office Thursday.
The College created the Community Council — composed of students, faculty members, and other affiliates — ahead of the 2020-21 academic year to oversee and enforce the community compact, a list of residential guidelines meant to complement the College’s social distancing and testing protocols amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
As a “non-disciplinary body,” the Community Council works to review violations of the community compact and issues subsequent warnings to non-compliant students, though it also carries the authority to send students home for not following the College's coronavirus guidelines.
A total of 440 students were referred to the Community Council for violating the community compact in the last academic year, according to the report. Of those, eight students were found to have not committed a violation, and 36 students were removed from on-campus housing.
A total of 108 students were referred to the Community Council over the summer, with three students ultimately being removed from on-campus housing.
The most common violations for students during the academic year were related to not adhering to the College's testing protocol and failure to complete Crimson Clear, a daily coronavirus symptom attestation that was mandated for students living on campus. Over the summer, the most common violations involved the testing protocol and the off-campus travel protocol.
Though the Council handled 440 referrals over the course of the academic year, there were a total of 470 concerns, as some instances contained multiple violations of the Community Compact. During the summer, there were 108 concerns matching each of the 108 referrals.
The Council could take six different courses of action when reviewing each violation, ranging from a disciplinary warning to removal from on-campus housing.
Over the 2020-21 academic year and the summer, the most common response by the Community Council was a warning from a community health lead — a tutor, proctor, or faculty dean — and did not require a full Council review.
A warning from the Community Council chair was the second-most common response from the Council for both the academic year and over the summer.
Removal from campus — an action that required a full Council review — was one of the least common responses from the Council during the summer but was cited as the fourth most common response during the school year.
In October 2020, The Crimson reported that three freshmen were removed from Mather House after hosting an unauthorized indoor gathering with multiple guests.
In a statement from January, College spokesperson Rachael Dane reiterated the Community Council’s role in protecting the health and safety of those on campus.
“The Community Council’s role is to help uphold students’ commitment to keeping Harvard, and the broader community, safe during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Dane wrote. “The Community Council's work is guided by two values: protecting the health and safety of all members of the College community and preserving the ability of students to learn and teachers to teach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union voted overwhelmingly to authorize what would be its second strike in two years, union officials announced late Thursday.
Out of the 2,029 members who cast ballots, 1,860 of them — 91.67 percent of voters — authorized a strike, easily clearing the two-thirds majority required. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s Bargaining Committee can now move to call for a strike at any time.
“We expect this to send a message, a strong message to Harvard that the way that things have gone at the table to this point, even when there have been improvements, have not been enough yet,” HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said in an interview following the vote count.
HGSU-UAW went on strike in December 2019 after two years of bargaining for its first contract with the University. Roughly 90 percent of voters authorized that strike, and five weeks later, student workers headed to the picket lines.
This month’s strike authorization vote comes after nearly six months of contract negotiations between the union and the University. HGSU-UAW is calling on Harvard to allow independent arbitration for discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, as well as raise compensation and benefits in their second contract.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Thursday evening that Harvard believes a strike is “unwarranted” in light of the University’s most recent proposals.
“The University feels a strike is unwarranted given the progress the two sides have made in recent weeks, including the University proposing $14 million in increases above the previous contract’s compensation and benefits levels, and the option to use third-party arbitration to appeal non-Title IX harassment and discrimination claims,” Newton wrote.
While the union saw those proposals as a “far more substantial offer,” the Bargaining Committee does not plan to accept them, according to Mancilla.
The strike authorization results were announced just after 8:15 p.m. to a small crowd of graduate students in Emerson Hall. Electronic and paper ballot voting ran from Sept. 13 until Thursday at 6:30 p.m.
Union members said the voter turnout and vote result exemplified the strength of their organizing.
HGSU-UAW trustee Zeke P. Benshirim, who attended the vote count and announcement, wrote in a statement that he was “thrilled” to see many of his peers voting.
“This is what democracy looks like on our campus,” he wrote. “But it’s also just the beginning: the next steps our union takes will call for even more engagement and collective decision-making, not less.”
HGSU-UAW steward Harrison T. Reeder wrote in a statement that he was impressed that 386 student workers joined the union during the vote.
“The fact that almost 400 new members joined during the SAV to vote is incredible, and speaks both to how much energy went into turning out student workers to vote, as well as how much energy there is to push for our core issues and back up the result,” he wrote.
In an email to faculty and staff on Monday, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay asked her colleagues to “plan ahead for how you would manage the potential disruption a strike could cause.”
Gay also reminded faculty that they are not allowed to ask student workers about the strike before HGSU-UAW officially calls for one.
According to the Office of the Provost’s website, student workers who go on strike would not be paid.
HGSU-UAW “unequivocally condemn[ed]” the University’s statements in an email to its membership Monday night.
“We are disappointed that the administration, instead of meeting to make progress in negotiations, sends communications that seek to intimidate us from participating in collective action, pit student workers with different funding plans against each other, and scare student workers,” the HGSU-UAW Executive Board wrote.
The union and the University finalized plans Thursday to continue negotiations with a federal mediator and will meet every Wednesday for the next three weeks, according to Mancilla.
HGSU-UAW member Jennifer L. Cruz said she felt “very excited” that the union authorized a strike.
“We’ve always been waiting to see what the University’s next move is,” Cruz said. “But now we have something that we can put against that, if we need to.”

Employees at Harvard Square coffee chains Pavement Coffeehouse and Darwin’s Ltd. have moved to unionize in recent months as the stores seek to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Workers at both Pavement and Darwin’s declared their intentions to unionize after delivering a letter to their companies in June and September, respectively.
Pavement Coffeehouse CEO Larry S. Margulies said in an interview that he felt “a little bit of ambivalence” when his employees informed him about their decision to unionize.
“I believe in people’s rights to do whatever they want,” Margulies said. “Now is a tough time for us to be having a conversation like this, coming out of Covid. It caught me by surprise, but I’m pretty neutral on this subject.”
“But I also understand my needs as a businessperson. If we can coexist, great. It does not have to be a zero sum game,” he added. “It doesn’t have to be, for one side to win, the other side has to lose. But there are definitely challenges right now.”
The negotiation process between employees and management at Pavement is now underway, according to Margulies. He maintains that his “ultimate goal” is to have happy workers who care about the business.
“That’s why I’m happy to talk to the union and sit down with them,” Margulies explained. “I recognized that union very quickly, and I said, if this is something my employees want to explore, then I am happy to explore it with them.”
Employees at Darwin’s said they modeled their unionization effort after the one at Pavement.
Annina C. Kennedy-Yoon ’20, a barista at Darwin’s and a member of the organizing committee, said that workers were driven to unionize to rally for improved working conditions.
Kennedy-Yoon said that besides preparing food and serving guests, her job also entails reminding people to wear masks, which she described as “frustrating and tiring.”
“It’s really unfortunate to see how people just don’t see you as a person,” she said.
Mitchell Fallon — the communications and political director of New England Joint Board UNITE HERE, which represents both unions — said that the union at Darwin’s has been voluntarily recognized by the company and will now move to formulate the intended aims of the union.
Fallon added that, once a card count procedure has taken place to determine how many workers are in favor of unionizing, negotiations for a contract will begin.
“There were no firm demands inside of that initial letter because it really is a collective process,” Fallon said. “We need to get together with all of the workers of Darwin’s to understand how everyone is feeling about things.”
Steven Darwin, the owner of the eponymous coffee chain, confirmed that the store was in the “legal process of formal recognition.”
“Until agreements are signed and the State recognizes the union, I and the management team have to stay completely neutral so as to not sway the process,” Darwin wrote. “I can say that we do look very much forward to working with Darwin’s United Union to navigate these challenging times in industry.”

A rising rat population in Harvard Square is pestering students and city officials alike, as Cambridge tries to address the influx of unwelcome rodentia.
Following complaints from residents, the Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a policy order on Sept. 13 to combat the recent increase in rats. The order outlined actions including a report on rodent and pest control efforts since last February, and the creation of a liaison position for rodent complaints within city-wide departments.
Cambridge also announced a Private Property Rodent Control program last Thursday to help residents combat rats in smaller-scale private properties.
Urban rodentologist and pest management consultant Robert Corrigan wrote in an email that a convergence of factors including food waste, environmental pressures, and the coronavirus pandemic may account for the recent proliferation of rodents in the city. He noted that rats may have relocated to areas including Harvard and the Square, generating the increased sighting complaints.
“[There is] much more food (protein) for the rats that survived the pandemic and they will eat well and live well allowing them [to] have a general high reproductive potential,” he wrote.
That might cause the population level to “temporarily exceed” the pre-pandemic “equilibrium,” Corrigan wrote.
Jacky Huang ’24 — who has encountered rats near Kirkland, Eliot, and Winthrop Houses — called his run-ins with the furry creatures “unpleasant.”
“We just see two rats scurrying past right in front of us — literally less than 10 feet in front of us — and we were just like, ‘Is that what we think it is?'” Huang said. “That was really scary.”
Dominic J. Skinnion ’23, who returned to campus in the fall after studying remotely during the pandemic, said this year marks the first time he has come across rats in his time at Harvard.
“Freshman year I didn’t see any rats,” he said. “I saw a lot of mice, but no rats.”
Matthew J. Frye — a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s New York State Integrated Pest Management Program — said there are municipal strategies to combat rat infestations including bait stations, effective large-scale garbage cleanup, and technologies to prevent rats from finding harborage in soil. He added, however, that individuals also hold considerable power in helping manage rat populations.
“I always try to relate rat issues to garbage, and how garbage is stored, where garbage is available, when garbage is picked up,” he said. “If there are ways to minimize the food that’s available to rats, that will influence where their populations are.”
Frye also noted that though rat populations depend on a number of complicated factors, the local population will likely decrease in the coming months.
“We do know that winter has a harsh effect on rat populations, that mortality does increase through the winter months — it’s harder to find harborage for them that will buffer them against cold temperatures,” he said. “So we will predict a decrease.”
Harvard Campus Services spokesperson Michael Conner wrote in an email that Harvard has a “comprehensive, integrated” pest management program receptive to shifting needs, and that the University’s Environmental Public Health group uses a bevy of strategies to manage rodents and other pests.
While some students said they had disdain for the trash scoundrels, others have more sympathy.
Yao Yu ’23, who said he saw a rat scurrying through the Quincy Courtyard, said he found the creature somewhat endearing.
“Freshman year, rats would come out at like 2 a.m.,” he said. “But now it’s 10 p.m., and there are rats just wandering around the streets.”
“I’m like, ‘Oh, it’s kind of cute,’” Yu added. “Kind of scary, but kind of cute.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To be the best, you have to beat the best. For the first time this season, Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) will play a team ranked higher than it in national Football Championship Series (FCS) rankings polls, when it travels to Worcester, Mass. to play Holy Cross (3-1, 0-0 Patriot League). Holy Cross, after a 45-15 win over No. 19/20 Monmouth last week in West Long Branch, N.J., rose to No. 24/RV headed into Saturday’s game, which will be played at the Crusaders’ Fitton Field at 1:30 p.m..
Holy Cross’ win over Monmouth marked its second victory over the Hawks in school history and just Monmouth’s second loss in its new home stadium, Kessler Stadium, which opened in 2017. Defensively, the Crusaders managed to find success both through the air and on the ground against Monmouth, limiting them to 121 rushing yards on 36 attempts (3.4 yards per carry) and intercepting quarterback Tony Muskett while holding him to just 133 yards and a touchdown on 16/27 passing. Meanwhile, their offense ran smoothly and efficiently, with sophomore quarterbacks Marco Siderman and Matthew Sluka and junior punter Patrick Haughney combining for 308 passing yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. Their rushing attack, led by senior Peter Oliver (10 carries for 64 yards), racked up 199 yards on 32 attempts (6.2 YPC). Holy Cross surely hopes to keep up some of its momentum against the Crimson.
But Harvard is coming off a similarly impressive victory over its Ivy League rival, Brown, and currently sits in first place in the Ivy League. In its 49-17 win at Harvard Stadium on September 24, the Crimson held the Bears to just 14 yards rushing on 26 attempts (0.5 YPC), and, although it allowed 2019 All-Ivy First Team quarterback EJ Perry to pass for 346 yards, sophomore defensive back Khalil Dawsey returned one of his passes 77 yards to set up a touchdown. On the offensive side of the ball, sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean looks to continue his solid play from last Friday’s contest, when he completed14 of his 24 passes for 156 yards and a trick-play score on a 44-yard pass to junior wide receiver Kym Wimberley.
After rushing for 335 yards against Georgetown, Harvard’s offense again relied on its talented trio of running backs, with sophomores Aidan Borguet and Sone Ntoh and junior Aaron Shampklin combining for 189 of the Crimson’s 243 rushing yards in the victory. Shampklin was particularly efficient; after contributing 121 yards in his 13 carries against Brown, he leads the country with 152 yards per game and 11.26 yards per carry. Overall, Harvard’s rushing attack is ranked second in FCS, with 289 yards per game. Only perennial powerhouse North Dakota State has rushed for more, for the Bison have averaged 348.3 yards per game over three contests.
“Number one is the [offensive line]. They’ve been doing a great job up front, opening holes. They make our lives easier,” Borguet explained. “And lastly, I think it’s our brotherhood in the room. We all love each other. We all wish the best for each other. There’s no selfishness. We see each other in the game and we’re rooting for each other. So I just think all that collectiveness between us is something that we’re all proud of and something that we look forward to come game day.”
Borguet has fond memories of his last game against Holy Cross, a 31-21 victory in Worcester on October 19, 2019, when he turned his 14 carries into 75 yards (5.4 YPC) as part of an exceptional debut season that saw him win the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award. In fact, the whole organization does; overall, in their 71 meetings on the gridiron since 1904, Harvard holds a 44-25-2 record. The Crimson have emerged victorious in 7 of their last 10 games against Holy Cross, including a 52-3 trouncing in 2012.
However, this is a new Crusaders team, now nationally ranked, and recent history matters little as Harvard readies for Saturday’s matchup. First-year defensive lineman Thor Griffith said that in practice, the defense has been watching film and preparing for specific play calls. Griffith predicted that the physicality of Holy Cross’ offensive line would prove to be the biggest challenge that his defense had faced thus far this season.
“As a defense, we’ve been looking up Holy Cross’ scheme and just being able to recognize plays and their different formations and what we’re going to do from their alignments,” he explained. “They’re a pretty standard offense, but their O-line: they’re big, they’re strong, they’re going to be the best O-line we face so far, so it’s going to be a challenge, but I think we can handle it.”
Despite praising the offensive line, he subsequently noted that Holy Cross head coach Bob Chesney and offensive coordinator Justin Roper rarely call for double teams, allowing their offensive linemen to be matched up one-on-one against a Harvard defender, an opportunity that he hoped to take advantage of.
Another unique feature of the Crusaders offense: it features a dual-quarterback threat, with both Siderman and Sluka contributing against Monmouth. Each quarterback attempted 15 passes -- Siderman contributed 181 yards and two touchdowns, while Sluka added 86 yards and a score. Additionally, although they both struggled on the ground against Monmouth, each quarterback is mobile. Siderman racked up 426 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground as a high school senior at Westlake in Thousand Oaks, Calif., while Sluka actually led Holy Cross in rushing in his Patriot League Rookie of the Year campaign in 2021, totaling 268 yards and four touchdowns in four games during the shortened season. The quarterbacks’ favorite target is senior wide receiver Tenio Ayeni, who was an All-Patriot League second teamer in 2019.
Holy Cross boasts the 25th-strongest rushing attack in the FCS, averaging 188.5 rushing yards per game. Oliver, its senior running back, was named to the All-Patriot League second team in spring 2021, racking up 226 yards on 32 rushes, good for 7.1 yards per carry. He shared his second team bid with teammate Tyler Purdy, who also contributed on special teams. If they are to keep up their good form against Harvard, though, they’ll have to face an equally formidable opponent.
Griffith and the stout Harvard defensive line have allowed just 20 total rushing yards across its two games, the second fewest in FCS so far, behind only Ivy League rival Princeton, which has not yielded a net rushing yard. Standout junior linebacker Chris Smith leads the nation in forced fumbles per game (1.0) after punching out two against Brown, and overall, the Crimson is also second in sacks (4.5 per contest). In addition to Smith’s contributions, Griffith got through for a strip sack on Bears quarterback EJ Perry, allowing senior defensive lineman Justin Mitchell to scoop up the loose ball and score from 13 yards out.
“First off, we have a great senior core. We get a lot of good guys that are good leaders, then also we have a lot of younger guys like myself coming up that are really pushing the program along. And also, we have great coaches, great staff that’s really bringing us together,” explained Griffith.
On offense, sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean has done a great job protecting the ball, for Harvard has not lost a single turnover all season. For the season, Dean has completed 24 of his 43 passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns while rushing seven times for an additional 24 yards. Wimberley has been the most frequent beneficiary, hauling in eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. Sophomore quarterback Jack Bill, with his 59 yards on three catches, ranks second on the Crimson in receiving yards.
The high-powered Crimson offense will face Holy Cross’ defense, led by captain Jacob Dobbs, a junior linebacker who was named to the All-Patriot League first team in spring 2021. He amassed 41 total tackles, including 25 solo tackles, in his four games, and was named FCS Defensive Player of the Week after his 12-tackle performance against Fordham on March 27. Dobbs has started the season where he left off, contributing three sacks as the Crusaders managed to slow down the Monmouth offense. Overall, Holy Cross sports the 43rd-ranked rushing defense in FCS, allowing 128.2 yards per contest. Borguet recognized the threat that the fast and physical Crusaders posed, but remained confident in his team’s game plan.
“They’re a great team, all around. All-American linebackers, great D-linemen. We’re just looking to play our game at the end of the day. It’s less about how well they’re going to play us, and more about how well we can execute our own schemes and our own plans,” said Borguet. “I think sticking to our reads, trusting our o-line, and just making the most out of the runs we can get. Not expecting the big one early, take what we can get and just continue to chip and chip until the five-yard gains start to turn to ten-yard gains.”
If the Crimson win at Fitton Field, located just 38 miles away from Harvard Stadium, its 3-0 record would mark its best season-opening stretch since 2016, when it won its first four games. After a lively crowd of 20,748 helped propel his team to victory, Griffith was hopeful that some Harvard fans would take the one hour, 30 minute train ride to Worcester.
When asked if he hoped to recreate a home atmosphere at the nearby away game, his answer was simple: “Oh yeah, definitely. Can’t wait.”
For fans who can not make it to the game, it will be streamed live on ESPN+ and broadcast on 95.3 FM by WRHB.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Slogging out a gloomy Boston day, the Harvard men's and women's cross country teams raced in the Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown this Friday, Sept. 24th. Just five days after an impressive performance at HYP, the Crimson delivered again against a tough slate of opponents, including No. 6 nationally ranked Arkansas, as well as familiar foes and Ivy League rivals Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth and Brown.
Both teams placed ahead of their Ivy counterparts, with the men’s average time of 24:42 (96 points) landing them fourth out of 20 teams in their 8k race. The women's team came in fifth out of the 22 running their 5k race, finishing with 153 points along with an average time of 17:52 per runner.
In the early-season hitout, it was the depth of the team that stood out, with 43 and 42 seconds separating the top fives of the women’s and men’s teams respectively. This consistency placed five runners from the women's team and an outstanding seven from the men’s team in the top 50 of their races.
“Our team is a lot deeper than it has historically been...one through seven, one through ten,” said Associate Head Coach Alex Gibby, who called the race a “good late-September performance” for both teams.
On an individual level, 17th-placed Sophomore Isabell Sagar continued to do her work up front for the Women’s team. However, it was talented first-year Maia Ramsden who outkicked her in the last straight, winning the day for the Crimson women in a time of 17:31 (13th overall). Senior co-captain and 2019 All-Ivy First Team selection Anna Juul was a steady presence, finishing with a time of 17:53. Sophomore Eloise Freitag and Senior co-captain Judy Pendergast rounded out the Crimson’s top five, with respective 18:05 (42nd) and 18:14 (49th) performances being just enough to beat Columbia for 5th place.
In the men’s race, sophomore standout Acer Iverson followed up on his second place finish at HYP with a scorching time of 24:20, good for 10th overall. Senior Matt Periera was nipping at his heels, just 15 seconds behind Iverson in 14th place. True freshman Graham Blanks showed his impressive potential once again, staying right with the leading pack through 5k, finishing in 24:51 (21st).
“He cratered a little bit in the last 400-600m,” said Gibby, but this is still early days for Blanks’ career for the Crimson. “He’s a big talent...he’s going to be a really good one for us.”
Finishing one spot ahead of Blanks in 20th position was junior Co-captain David Melville, who ran a strong race in a time of 24:51. Melville concurred with Gibby on the depth of the team, emphasizing the importance 0f this going forward.“If you watch any of the really good teams in the NCAA, they usually have a pack of four, five, six guys all running together,” Melville said.
The co-captain pointed out the mental advantage of staying tight throughout the run.
“Mid-race that really fires you up, keeps you reminded of what and who you're doing it for,” he said.
Both Melville and Gibby stressed the MO of the team in these early stages of the season: Process, process, process. In the approach to last weekend, Gibby highlighted that “we were looking to execute a little better, be a little tactically better in the setup.”
For a team that has it’s targets locked on the championship races at the end of the fall, he says these early season fixtures are all about “developing the habits mentally that we want to execute when the physical preparation catches up.”
The team has a few weeks off to work on that execution before heading to Madison, Wis., for the Nuttycombe Wisconsin Invitational on October 15.

Roses are red, violets are blue, Trader Joe’s fall treats are here, and we’ve tried some for you! It’s that time of year again: sweater weather, crunchy leaves, and pumpkin-spice everything. On our mission to find the best fall-themed snacks, Trader Joe’s comes once again to our rescue, giving us a reason (or excuse?) to make the trip to our favorite grocery store (please sponsor us, TJ). Here are our ratings for the new TJ fall snacks, with a dash of cinnamon, pumpkin spice and everything nice.
Pumpkin Spiced teeny tiny Pretzels 
CJZ: 9.5/10. Look at them! They’re so so cute. The pumpkin flavor is amazing and I love the yogurt. They’re so tiny I could probably finish a whole bag of them while suffering over psets.
TC: 10/10. Just the right amount of pumpkin and cinnamon flavor for that festive fall vibe. Sweet from the yogurt dipping, salty from the pretzel itself. Definitely gonna be munching on these to motivate myself through my psets when the dhall Brain Breaks run out of their less-than-exciting plain pretzels.
Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps
CJZ: 7/10. I love the idea of them, but I’m not the hugest fan of cranberries. I think these would be really yummy and aesthetic on a charcuterie board, though!
TC: 6/10. Nice and crisp, with a subtle pumpkin flavor, but there’s nothing really special about it. Maybe it would pair better with a dip or something. I would snack on these if available, but not my first choice selection.
Non-Dairy Pumpkin Oat Beverage
CJZ: 4.5/10. Who at Trader Joe’s comes up with these wack product ideas? I love pumpkin and oat milk separately, but together is just a no. The packaging is adorable, though.
TC: 5/10. I pity people who are lactose intolerant because this just doesn’t slap like real milk. It’s alright — has quite a pumpkin/cinnamon flavor, but it’s not a great aftertaste. 1% milk all the way.
Maple Sea Salt Kettle Corn
CJZ: 7/10. I really enjoyed this! I love sweet and savory combinations, especially the flavor of maple. Would buy again for sure.
TC: 4/10. Looks like regular kettle corn, tastes like regular kettle corn. I guess kettle corn is just sweet popcorn, so the maple flavor is just sweet flavor. Nothing too exciting imo, doesn’t really scream “fall” for me.
Pumpkin Ginger Mini Ice Cream Cone
CJZ: 10/10. THESE ARE SO GOOD!! The gingery pumpkin flavor really comes out, and each cone is the perfect size for a snack (or you can have 3, no judgment). My crappy dorm freezer did melt them a bit, so they were soggy. Still delicious!
TC: 9/10. -1 because these need to be bigger. So good, really can’t go wrong with ice cream tbh. Pumpkin + ice cream = match made in heaven.
We hope this article makes you want to run to the closest Trader Joe’s (a solid 20-minute trek) and stock up on their fall products. Wishing you the best of luck on your TJ’s journey, whether you’re shopping for your next fall-themed extracurricular social or just scouting ingredients for a personal ~autumnal~ charcuterie board. Go crazy!!
