After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When writer Naomi Klein and I helped launch the fossil fuel divestment movement in 2012, it was largely modeled on the anti-apartheid movement that I’d seen and reported on at Harvard in my undergraduate days. We thought that fossil fuel companies represented a not entirely dissimilar rogue capitalism, willing to break the planet in the name of their business model. By the end of that year, there were hundreds of divestment campaigns underway at American colleges, including, of course, one at Harvard.
And Harvard’s then-University President Drew G. Faust was among the first leaders in higher education to respond, with a 2013 letter explaining why the University would never divest. It was a farrago of defensive nonsense: Among other things, she argued that, “given our pervasive dependence on these companies for the energy to heat and light our buildings, to fuel our transportation, and to run our computers and appliances, it is hard for me to reconcile that reliance with a refusal to countenance any relationship with these companies through our investments.” Her argument, in short, was that Harvard couldn’t divest from fossil fuels until fossil fuels were no longer important — which makes, if you think about it, no sense at all.
One isn’t surprised that the fossil fuel industry loved Harvard’s stand, but I confess it saddened me enormously that The Crimson Editorial Board in those days loved it too, scolding those who stood up to the fossil fuel industry. Happily, students paid no attention and continued their fight over an entire decade — not an easy feat, since University administrators count on the fact that undergraduate passions will last, at maximum, four years. I think of activists like Chloe Maxmin, who helped lead the fight in her undergraduate days and has had enough time afterward to become a force in the Maine state legislature (which, by the way, divested the state’s pension fund before Harvard got around to it).
This same story was playing out across the world, with thousands and thousands of campaigns and campaigners. We won at the University of California, at Oxford, at Cambridge; we won in the New York City and State pension funds, each of them five times the size of Harvard’s endowment. The Rockefellers divested. The country of Ireland divested. And as all this happened, a few things grew ever clearer.
One, despite what Faust had claimed, there was no financial penalty for divesting. Indeed, institutions that divested early made out like bandits since the fossil fuel sector dramatically underperformed the rest of the economy for the last 10 years. Had Harvard divested when students first asked, the absurd endowment would be even more absurd.
Second, despite what The Crimson had confidently insisted, divestment pinched the industry hard, both reputationally and in its access to capital. Former Crimson president Jim J. Cramer ’77 devoted his airtime on CNBC a year ago to explaining why you shouldn’t buy oil shares — in short, because “we’re starting to see divestment all over the world.” Shell Oil, in a recent annual report, called divestment a material risk to its business, which is a good thing since Shell’s business is a material risk to planet earth.
Eventually, all of this overwhelmed Harvard. The wonderful organizers at Divest Harvard never gave up. Alumni led by former U.S. Senator Tim Wirth ’61 barraged Massachusetts Hall. The clever strategists at Harvard Forward launched an assault on the Overseers. Faculty joined in the fight. There were even legal challenges under ancient provisions of the College charter. And, of course, The Crimson came around, finding itself on the right side of history.
As in most such cases, the powers that be eventually decided that the pain of divesting (which runs the risk of offending rich and conservative alums) was outweighed by the pain of staying the course. After all, Harvard has to market itself to a world of high school students for whom climate change has become the defining issue of the age. Eventually, President Bacow blinked.
But it was all about the persistence. Had the effort ever lapsed in the face of official scorn, Harvard would still be in league with Exxon, trying to make a little more money off the collapse of the planet. I remember most vividly Harvard Heat Week, in April of 2015. Some of those memories are uncomfortable — sleeping one night in the shrubbery outside Massachusetts Hall, and the next in the occupied alumni office. But I remember most of all my beloved colleague, Koreti Tiumalu, who I’d brought from her native South Pacific to Cambridge for the event. She explained, over and over, that the wealth of Harvardians rested on the drowning of her homeland. Koreti has since died, but when you’re part of a movement you have a kind of afterlife, and she — not the seemingly invincible masters of the planet that reign in the Yard — carried the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost all teaching staff at Harvard have a doctorate or are pursuing one. From teaching fellows to professors, the Ph.D. path seems to be the essence of qualification. Without a Ph.D. it is almost impossible to teach at any elite American university. We must ask ourselves: What is it about the degree that gives it such a special quality?
The doctoral degree greatly emphasizes research and specialty, but the undergraduate needs a teacher with broader sympathies, skill in pedagogy, and a concern for the non-academic growth of the student above all else.
The modern Ph.D. has been in many ways shaped by the 19th century German University. These academic institutions focused on knowledge production, so-called, and approached their subject matters philologically. That is to say, the Gymnasium wanted students to discover rather than to learn, and in doing so they redefined the purpose of the university. When reading the Iliad, for example, a Gymnast may prefer to uncover original data on the origins of the work and how the language varies or is similar to Greek dialects of various epochs, as opposed to grasping the meaning of the work for its own sake. This style of study puts an emphasis on originality, creation, and specialization in contrast to the sympathy, understanding, and appreciation of studied works.
This academic style was imported across the Atlantic by Harvard University President Charles William Eliot and went on to shape Harvard and the intellectual advancements of the 20th century. With many brilliant minds hyper-focused on discovering new aspects of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, our scientific understanding soared and plentiful innovation followed. However, this new emphasis left the humanities in shambles. Surely in order to propose the Theory of Relativity one must already have a deep mathematical and physical understanding of the universe, but there is no such underlying necessity when postulating about the nature of the ghost in Hamlet.
This shift in the academic goal of the university is most obvious in the doctoral degree. The modern Ph.D. with a dissertation started to come into form in America in the late 19th century. Even the idea of “concentrations” at the undergraduate level is relatively new. History and Literature became the first concentration at Harvard in 1906, and it was not until 20 years later that the Senior Thesis requirement was introduced at Princeton.
The modern Ph.D. demonstrated to many that the purpose of the university was to create knowledge rather than to obtain it. If those who teach are mostly concerned by their university’s pedigree in writing new books, publishing journal articles, and contributing to scholarly research, they become less focused on gaining and sharing a deep and broad understanding of their field. One who is primarily tasked with finding out new things does not have the time to bother with the old things. A Classics professor whose job is now to figure out a new quality of a text undiscovered for two thousand years is not more qualified to teach than someone who has concentrated on everything said about that text for two thousand years.
Ph.D.'s can also create peculiarities and unsympathetic habits in the degree holders. If one is to spend many years of their life just studying Baudelaire, they may begin to place such importance and magnificence on him that they begin to lose grasp of the art of poetry as a whole. Their taste and critique of poetry will surely be filtered through a Baudelairean lens. Even if an undergraduate were to take a class on just Baudelaire, she would require someone who understands the poets who inspired him and those inspired by him.
While the Ph.D. requires general examinations to round out one’s knowledge, that does not undermine the research-oriented goal of the Ph.D. nor does it cure the narrow prejudices that come with the dissertation. We see the effects of this on class offerings. Professors are uninclined to teach courses on something outside their particular subject matter. So instead of a university such as Harvard having classes on all the artists and art movements that are essential knowledge for any art historian there are very particular courses. Professors are generally uninterested in teaching survey courses, and this causes the undergraduate student to suffer.
Doctoral programs are fact factories seeking originality over the truth. The humanities are meant to train the human, not the academic. Regardless of what research should be done in graduate programs, the undergraduate should be taught how to exist in the world, what it is to be human, and what is ephemeral or eternal. The scientification of the humanities achieved through the Ph.D. greatly harms the education of students at the College. Harvard should consider how to create teachers instead of manufacturers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard community is about to witness a rousing example of the sort of transformative leadership administrators so often urge students to aspire to. No, we’re not talking about Harvard’s understated divestment announcement. Instead, students should look to the Harvard custodians, staff, and activists marching on Washington next week.
According to the Harvard TPS Coalition, approximately 200 members of the Harvard community are Temporary Protected Status holders. This immigration designation allows foreign nationals to remain in the U.S if they are unable to return safely to their countries of origin, often due to conflict or natural disaster. Harvard custodians, dining workers, and union members, many here on TPS themselves, co-founded the Harvard TPS Coalition in 2018 after the Trump administration abruptly revoked El Salvador’s TPS designation.
Ever since, the coalition has worked to protect the precarious status of TPS holders in the U.S. Last week, its members breathed a sigh of relief as the Department of Homeland Security announced a 15-month extension of the TPS designation for El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Sudan, a clear win for every TPS holder from these still-embattled countries. But, after celebrations, they quickly steeled for the greater fight ahead: ensuring a path to permanent residency for TPS holders stays in the current catch-all, hotly debated U.S. House reconciliation bill.
While the extension of TPS eligibility is well worth celebrating, it is by no means enough. The Temporary Protected Status program offers an array of benefits, including a blanket path to effective asylum without the red tape linked to the actual asylum application. The program is a humane acknowledgment of the fact that sometimes entire countries urgently need evacuating. But, unlike those granted asylum, TPS holders have no direct path to legal residency, meaning they are effectively trapped in migratory uncertainty. For the thousands of TPS holders who fled domestic horror and found refuge in the United States, there is simply no optimistic outcome under the current legislative framework. The Supreme Court recently deemed all illegal entrants ineligible for green cards or other permanent resident status, a previous legislative grey area. Once the current extension expires, they will be left out in the bitter cold — irrespective of the conditions of their home country or of the length and breadth of their American lives.
Activist calls for a path to residency are not only justified — they are the only reasonable response to a migratory framework that tacitly recognizes the asylum eligibility of TPS holders while simultaneously condemning them to needless precarity.
The coalition's organizing is thus urgent. Its members are right to take the fight to Congress, which has the power to legislate a path to residency. Their upcoming March on Washington alongside the National TPS Coalition couldn’t be better timed: A path to permanent residency for TPS holders is a potential part of the catch-all reconciliation bill currently being debated by congressional Democrats.
Harvard students have been welcomed onto the TPS Coalition’s bus to Washington. We applaud every single one of our classmates that has taken them up on the offer, likely in acknowledgment of the strange power a Harvard student’s affiliation with a cause has.
Whatever power Harvard students have to influence political discourse, the power of the Harvard President is astronomically greater. University President Lawrence S. Bacow has previously admirably written to Congress and President Biden himself urging that TPS status be extended for certain countries. Now he should take the lead from his own visionary staff and join the call for a direct path to residency for TPS status holders — many of whom keep his university running, and, independent of the labor they give Harvard, deserve our support; especially since a direct line can be drawn from the U.S.’s disastrous neocolonial meddling to many TPS designated countries.
Harvard’s TPS Coalition is showing us how to work to change the world. They deserve our raucous support in return.

Harvard School of Public Health epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch and postdoctoral research fellow Rebecca Kahn will help establish a new center dedicated to disease forecasting and outbreak analytics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to an Aug. 18 press release from the School of Public Health.
With initial funding from the White House’s Covid-19 American Rescue Plan, the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics will bring together public health professionals, emergency responders, and experts in disease modeling to help shape government policy regarding public health crises. Lipsitch and Kahn will serve as the center’s director of science and senior scientist, respectively.
One of the center’s goals is to leverage data analytics to help establish effective public health measures, according to Kahn.
“​The Covid-19 pandemic has identified a real need for figuring out how best to use data analytics modeling to inform decision-makers, and then help them make decisions to improve outbreak response,” Kahn said.
“It’s not only a scientific activity — it’s really a decision-informing activity, which is more targeted,” Lipsitch added.
Lipsitch also said the center hopes to synthesize and apply data from the current Covid-19 pandemic as well as previous health crises, including the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
“There are enormous amounts of data in many different places that we’re still beginning to appreciate where it all is and what it all is,” he said.
Upon collecting and analyzing this data, the center aims to disseminate these findings to businesses and nonprofits, as well as improve the accessibility of public health information to the broader public.
According to Lipsitch, an early motivation for the creation of the center arose from a conference in 2010, during which he realized there needs to be an increased focus on science that can better inform policies to control diseases.
The center aims to establish collaborations with other public health initiatives at the School of Public Health, including the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, where Lipsitch serves as director. These efforts, according to Lipsitch, will focus on training individuals to translate data analysis and disease modeling into public health policy recommendations.
“It’s redoubling our understanding of the need for more and better training, because there just aren't a lot of people out there who have the requisite mix of skills,” Lipsitch noted. “We need to expand that pool.”
The Center will also be led by Dylan George, who is a former vice president of biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks, and Caitlin Rivers, a Johns Hopkins Public Health School professor who wrote the original proposal for the center. George and Rivers will serve as the Center’s director of operations and associate director, respectively.
While pursuing their new roles at the CDC, Lipsitch and Kahn will both continue working part-time in their research and academic positions at HSPH.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 1982 Supreme Court decision involving Harvard Square restaurant Grendel’s Den could serve as legal precedent to overturn Texas’s recent law banning most abortions, Harvard emeritus professors Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and David Rosenberg wrote in a Boston Globe opinion piece last week.
In the Globe op-ed, Tribe and Rosenberg wrote that the new Texas abortion law displays “fatal constitutional flaws,” citing the Massachusetts court case as precedent.
The Texas law, which went into effect on Sept. 1 and sparked national controversy, bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and notably relies on individuals to enforce the act through civil lawsuits against people who perform abortion procedures. The law provides Texas citizens a financial incentive to litigate: plaintiffs who win are entitled to $10,000 and covered legal fees, while those who lose do not have to pay defendants’ legal expenses.
The Supreme Court refused to block the law earlier this month, though it did not rule on its constitutionality. The Justice Department filed suit on Sept. 9 arguing that the law violates the Constitution.
The 1982 case — Larkin v. Grendel’s Den, Inc. — found a Massachusetts statute granting schools and churches the power to object to the issuance of liquor licenses for establishments within a 500-foot radius unconstitutional.
Grendel’s Den sued state liquor licensing authorities when its application was denied after a church located 10 feet away objected to its license. A federal district judge ruled the Massachusetts statute unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from creating laws that favor a religion or religion as a whole. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.
Tribe and Rosenberg wrote that the struck-down Massachusetts law gave private citizens “unbridled veto power” in the name of religion to prevent other citizens from exercising their rights — in this case, to serve alcohol.
The Texas law provides private citizens a similar veto power over the rights of others to obtain an abortion, the professors wrote.
“As with the Massachusetts liquor law, the Texas abortion law delegates quintessentially governmental power to private parties — in Texas, to literally anyone on earth with an objection to abortion,” they wrote.
Tribe and Rosenberg argued that the Grendel’s Den case established broad precedent prohibiting private actors from enforcing laws — let alone interfering with a constitutional right.
“In the Texas case, even a judge or justice convinced that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and that there is no constitutional right to end a pregnancy would need to confront the long line of precedent establishing that due process of law, enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not permit, to quote the court in Grendel’s Den ‘delegate[ing] to private, nongovernmental entities power to veto … a power ordinarily vested in agencies of government,’” Tribe and Rosenberg wrote.
The newfound attention to the case has provided a boon to the restaurant’s business and a walk down memory lane for its owner, Kari Kuelzer.
“When my parents brought this case to the Supreme Court, I was 12 years old, and I went to the Supreme Court with them, and my mother sat with me, next to me, kind of explaining to me what the importance of all this was,” Kuelzer said. “Everyone really knew that it had a lot more to do with the rule of law and justice and the power of the American system than just like, can we serve a beer?”
Kuelzer said following her restaurant’s appearance on The Rachel Maddow show on Sept. 7, her phone “blew up” with online orders, and the online store sold $20,000 worth of items in a week.
“We are considering making a special edition bunch of apparel that actually highlights that we’ve been serving up hummus with a side of justice since 1982,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) discussed her career in public service, Democrats’ “Build Back Better” agenda, and current challenges to U.S. democracy at an Institute of Politics forum event Thursday evening.
The forum came amid a push by Democrats in Congress to pass landmark legislation, including a voting rights bill to counter Republican-led voting restrictions in various states as well as a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that would expand the social safety net and make investments in renewable energy. Alexis A. Elliot ’22, chair of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership at the IOP, and Alexander K. Park ’23, co-chair of the Harvard Votes Challenge, moderated the event.
Clark, who represents Harvard’s district and serves as the Assistant Speaker of the House of Representatives, focused on the issue of child care, highlighting the racial and economic inequalities exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Child care is provided by women and predominantly women of color, and their work has always been underpaid or not paid, and undervalued,” Clark said. “When everything shut down, this became very hard for child care providers to keep existing.”
Clark also specifically touted the reconciliation bill’s child care provisions.
“We are on the verge in the next few weeks, if we keep pushing, to have universal preschool for all three and four year olds – to be able to put $25 billion dollars of infrastructure dollars into childcare providers, centers, family homes, so they can expand,” she said.
Park asked Clark to respond to criticisms of the reconciliation bill, including Harvard Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s recent assertions that the bill was “too big and too risky” and that “more incremental steps” would be wiser.
Clark argued the bill was necessary to address problems facing the U.S. as a result of “chronic underinvestment.”
“Are we going to address climate change, or are we not?” Clark asked. “For women in this economy, we’ve been told for generations, ‘Your time is coming.’ For people of color, ‘your time is coming – don't push too hard.’ This is the time to push. This is the time to be bold.”
Clark also addressed her efforts to protect voting rights. While two voting rights bills – the For the People Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – have passed the House of Representatives, the bills have been blocked by Republicans in the Senate.
Clark said Democrats would continue to urge passage of the legislation and encouraged audience members to become engaged.
“We are still working to get these voting rights over the line,” Clark said. “This is where the power of communities is. It is where those cries for justice lead to action in protecting that right to vote.”
Responding to an audience question regarding the effects of her political career on her experience as a mother, Clark said that the challenges women face in society make their perspectives important in government.
“When I was working for the state, I realized that my entire salary was going to childcare,” Clark said. “It’s so crucial that we make a path.”
“I’ve been really committed to making sure that I’m always reaching back and helping women come up with us,” Clark added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid Harvard’s revived social scene, cultural groups are exchanging Zoom socials and meetings for in-person gatherings after more than 18 months of creating these spaces virtually.
Leaders of cultural organizations said despite the ongoing risk of Covid-19, their groups have been able to meet safely and even hold large events — both indoors and outdoors — for their members.
Earlier this month, the Black Students Association hosted Black Convocation, a welcome ceremony for Black freshmen first introduced in 2017. Though the event was hosted virtually in 2020, BSA welcomed all class years to the in-person ceremony held in Memorial Church, followed by an indoor after-party in the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
“It was a really beautiful event. I’m so happy that we were able to pull it together,” BSA outreach and inclusivity chair Rothsaida Sylvaince ’24 said.
BSA still had to scale down the event from previous years, including a last-minute decision to not invite students from other schools to the afterparty, as it has done in the past.
“In terms of the Covid cases that were rising on campus and the Covid risk, we didn’t want it to be a super spreader, especially to all the other universities in Boston,” Sylvaince said.
Melanie T. Munoz ’24, communications chair for Latinas Unidas and secretary for Fuerza Latina, said both clubs have taken various Covid-19 safety measures while also seeking ways to gather in person.
Fuerza Latina has required attendees to show proof of vaccination and matching IDs for a club-wide dance outing to celebrate the start of Hispanic Heritage Month.
“I’ve never seen a bigger group of Latinx people together,” Munoz said. “It’s just a clearer sense of community and I just feel really excited to be a part of it.”
Meanwhile, Latinas Unidas held their first in-person meeting in more than a year on Thursday.
Stephanie Lin ’24, social co-chair of the Chinese Students Association, said that her group has had to make accommodations for in-person events to adhere to Covid-19 capacity guidelines.
“There are space capacity limits and specifically certain spaces that you book will have the limit, so it’s kind of unique to each space that you have,” Lin said. “Usually on the side of safety, it’s just easier to do things that are outdoors and under tents.”
One challenge for the South Asian Association’s in-person return has been having to “bridge gaps” between different class years whose experiences bonding with others in the group may have been disjointed by the remote year, according to SAA co-president Varshini S. Odayar ’23.
“A lot of people just haven’t met each other,” Odayar said. “In a pre-pandemic year, it would have been a lot easier to foster this connection, so I think that’s something that was challenging but definitely something we’re working on to build community.”
Some cultural groups found takeaways from the online period, including SAA, which started an anonymous online forum last year for people to voice opinions, something it will bring back this year. BSA, on the other hand, may continue to bring in guest speakers via Zoom, according to Sylvaince.
Sylvaince said the period online provided a turning point for those of BSA’s members who have not yet experienced the club in-person to “reimagine” the future of the club.
“I’ve often heard about traditions that we’ve had as a club and seen pictures,” Sylvaince said. “But it’s been interesting to see how they play out and what different ways us coming into the school can affect how we want to continue some traditions, and also change them for the better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department has been arresting Black people at a disproportionate rate compared to the general population over the last three years, according to data from the department’s new workload and crime dashboard.
From 2018 to 2020, 37 percent of the non-Harvard affiliates arrested by HUPD have been Black, per the dashboard. In contrast, in the cities in which HUPD operates, only 10.8 percent of Cambridge residents, 5.7 percent of Allston residents, and 5 percent of Longwood residents are Black.
Arrest rates of Harvard affiliates show a similar trend. Thirty-five percent of affiliates arrested have been Black, a much higher percentage than the 7.6 percent of undergraduate and graduate students and 6.5 percent of faculty and staff members who are Black.
The dashboard, which the department launched in June, was a recommendation of the external review by 21CP Solutions into HUPD launched by University President Lawrence S. Bacow. The review, published last December, recommended a wholesale re-evaluation of HUPD’s policing philosophy and procedures.
The dashboard includes three calendar years’ worth of data, and according to the HUPD website, “serves to improve communication, information-sharing, and transparency.” The dashboard displays a breakdown of arrests and criminal complaints by several key points.
Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, who serves on a committee tasked with advising HUPD, said the disproportionate arrest figures were not shocking to him.
“I wasn’t too surprised, and that isn’t a good thing,” he said.
Harris said the advisory committee has met just once, and that meeting focused on urging HUPD to publish the dashboard as a measure of transparency. Harris said the dashboard serves as “proof” of what the advisory board “had to assume” before, which was that Black people were being arrested by HUPD at a disproportionate rate.
“We have to figure out, okay, now that we know that we have the dashboard as proof that these are issues, what are things we can do to mitigate those issues?” Harris said.
Ione Barrows, a graduate student and spokesperson for the Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops, a student group advocating for Harvard to defund HUPD, wrote in a statement that the data “confirm what student organizers have long been saying.”
“Harvard spends millions of dollars a year on a police force that violently targets racialized people, as well as poor, unhoused, and other marginalized members of our community,” Barrows wrote. “There is no reform that could expunge racism from HUPD.”
HAACC published a report in December 2020 titled “Harvard’s Finest?: The Case for the Abolition of the Harvard University Police Department.” The report, which group members spent five months researching and producing, revealed similar statistical trends to those documented in the new dashboard and set forth a seven-point list of demands it believes will set in motion the abolition of HUPD.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that all field stops and arrests HUPD makes are based on “reasonable articulable suspicion or probable cause that a crime has occurred, is in the process of occurring or is about to occur.”
“The HUPD takes seriously its responsibility to protect the rights of all members of our community,” Catalano wrote. “As part of that commitment, officers will not stop people in a manner that unlawfully discriminates on the basis of race, age, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation.”
Catalano also said HUPD takes “many factors” into account when deciding to arrest someone, including the seriousness of the offense and a victim’s preferences in how they would like the case concluded.
Nationally, Black people are five times more likely to be arrested than their white counterparts, according to a 2020 analysis by ABC News. And in Massachusetts, Black people make up just 6.5 percent of the population, but represent 17.1 percent of the criminal caseload, per a 2020 Harvard Law School report.
Chijindu G. “Jindu” Obiofuma, a former HLS fellow who co-authored the report, wrote in an email that the criminal justice system identifies Black people as targets for abuse, arrest, and imprisonment.
“Centering disparities play a role in uplifting that truth—that Black bodies are intentionally singled out for violence, even when marginally represented in surrounding communities—but there is no acceptable percentage of people deserving of the brutality of arrest and imprisonment, especially when the violence of policing is so deeply disconnected from any relationship to safety or justice that might be used to excuse it,” she wrote.
Per the HUPD dashboard, of all the incidents which resulted in arrest or in HUPD seeking criminal complaints between 2018-2020, just 11 percent of them were initiated by HUPD officers, while 89 percent were called in by affiliates.
A HUPD employee who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe figures not yet released to the public said that of the incidents resulting in criminal charges involving Harvard affiliates of color, zero were initiated by officers and were all called into the department.
Of the incidents in which HUPD arrested people of color not affiliated with the University, 11 percent were initiated by officers, and 89 percent were called in by Harvard affiliates, according to the HUPD employee.
Harris said that these figures underscore the need for alternative resources to HUPD, such as more robust mental health resources. He said that while the decision to call HUPD is a “gray area,” students have access to non-HUPD resources if they choose not to.
“When we are calling HUPD, we have to check our own bias as well, and so I think that’s something that we as a community have to work on and that a lot of communities have to work on,” Harris said.
“HUPD still has a lot to work on,” Harris added.

Yeah, yeah, yeah — you know what your FOP leader told you about the John Harvard Statue, Widener Stacks, and first day of reading period. Snooze fest. We’re back on campus, and for those of us who are in our final fall, it’s time to graduate to the big boy bucket list. Here’s some tasks for any senior who feels like they’re really up to the challenge.
Do something risky.
Go to an apple orchard. And don’t post a picture on social media. Sure, you might look cute in your H sweater, and that apple isn’t the only juicy thing in the photo, but risks are meant to be taken. Other options include trying to get into the Leverett dining hall on community dinner night if you’re not a resident, brewing your own dorm wine, or sticking the pointy part of the Lampoon ibis somewhere creative.
Get mistaken for a freshman.
Maybe you don’t remember where the dish drop is. Maybe you look a little young in your mask. Maybe you’re taking LS1a. Hey, if you can’t beat them, join them.
Get rejected from a job.
Right. Of. Passage.
Take a picture that has never been taken at Harvard before.
Lots of tourists, lots of cameras. But nobody has ever taken a picture of themselves rappelling down the side of Widener. Nobody has a pic of the time they wore nothing but a ripped-in-half phone book to CS50. Nobody has a 2 a.m. pset picture where everyone in frame looks happy.
Forget you’re thesising for about a week.
Oops.
Sled in the first snow.
Widener steps are for babies! Some creative options: the hill by Adams (beware of traffic), the banks of the Charles (beware of gGeese), the side of the GSD (beware of gravity). Grab and go with your HUDS tray, except you’ll be what’s flying by. Bonus points if you hit CGIS so I don’t have to go to section there anymore.
Get rid of those alcohol bottles you’ve been using as decoration.
This is maturity. This is adulthood. Those are recycling.
Tell someone you love them.
Options are endless. Mom? Estranged blockmate? Hot TF? Freshman fling one time hookup you’ve been obsessing over for the past four years and just need closure, dammit?
The semester has just begun, we have a lot of time, but all the same, endings don’t have to be scary. So let’s make this a good one. No regrets!
