After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the seventh season finale of “Game of Thrones,” writers Aziz B. Yakub and Grace Z. Li decided to sit down and have a conversation about the pitfalls and highlights of “The Dragon and the Wolf”.
Grace Z. Li: All right, let’s start with the meeting in King’s Landing.
Aziz B. Yakub: I’d say that the way they approached Cersei’s understanding of the situation compared to Jon’s—juxtaposing loyalty and some sense of honor with Cersei’s pure self-preservation—was actually rather brilliant, and was one of the few things that meeting did well. At its core, it put them in a position that reveals their personalities. In an overstuffed episode, it feels less egregious than it could have been.
On the whole, most of the season felt like it was ambling towards an unknown goal and an unknown end. There was, ultimately, something nice about having it all come together, and frankly, having some sort of vague sense that the writers actually knew what they were doing.
GL: I actually think that the writers had a very clear direction, but that that was the problem of this season. Everything felt too planned and too convenient, and sometimes just entirely unbelievable.
AY: The season felt like it was written from the end to the beginning, like they thought, “How can we put everyone in this position to make this event happen?”
I also feel like the show’s lost its bite. When’s the last time that someone of consequence has died? I feel like if you were watching it in a room full of people, everyone would have applauded at the deaths of this season.
GL: Like Littlefinger? It was really satisfying to see a character so undeniably selfish meet his end. But I don’t think that the scene was done well because of the poor buildup and characterization from past episodes. This entire season has sort of thrown us on a loop. We were really excited to see Sansa and Arya reunite, but then the writers made it seem like they were on opposite sides. So the twist at the end lacked a proper build-up. The idea of Arya and Sansa potentially plotting against Littlefinger was too much of a reach. Its execution was awkward and clumsy.
AY: I partially agree with what you said, but I just want it to be on the record that even though Littlefinger has many problems, I really do like him. This whole season has been moving towards this idea of individuals as good rulers because of their birthright. In this episode we are presented with Cersei learning all her lessons of leadership from her father—like her understanding that wars are won with gold. Jon is presented as this knight of honor because he’s supposedly Ned Stark’s bastard, and that his honor is presented in part as a product of his royal blood. His status is partially because of his character—but it is also partially because of what his blood has done for him. It is the same thing for Daenerys Targaryen.
Everyone who is fighting for the throne has some sort of royal claim—they are part of a long generation of houses that are royal. Littlefinger was the only character in the entire series who actually had a legitimate shot at the throne who wasn’t part of this small group of royally bred individuals. And I’m not saying that just because he’s a “commoner”—or not necessarily a commoner, but lower ranked—that it means that he is better than anyone else, or it erases all the cruel things that he’s done over seven seasons of television, and his backstabbing tendencies, and all the weird stuff that happened with Sansa. But what I am saying is that the show’s political message—the idea that great rulers are passed down from generation to generation in the same families—is misguided and is only reinforced by the death of Littlefinger. Littlefinger may not be a leader of the people, but he’s a leader from the people—and with his death dies the last hope of a leader from the people sitting on the Iron Throne.
GL: I can definitely see that, especially because idea of legitimacy from lineage is so heavily emphasized in all of the themes of the show—like when Jon’s real parents are revealed.
AY: Exactly—it’s like propaganda for monarchy. That’s what this show is.
GL: Speaking of Jon’s parents, what did you think about the big reveal?
AY: I didn’t really care for it. What did you think?
GL: I thought it was anticlimactic. Viewers already knew who Jon’s parents were, so the drama over the “big reveal” felt misplaced. I suppose the writers wanted to create more disgust surrounding Jon and Dany’s incest plotline, but I don’t feel like there was enough emotional angst on incest with this particular couple. We know the Targaryens practiced incest to keep their bloodlines “pure,” but we don’t know what the two’s stances on incest are. Most of our anticipated reactions are the result of assumption—we assume that Jon, Ned Stark’s adopted son, will not stand for it. But we haven’t been shown the proof yet, making this scene ultimately uninteresting.
AY: It was really a waste of a plotline.
GL: It could have been good. “Game of Thrones” has proven that it can write emotional turmoil well. Take Tyrion’s conversation with Cersei as an example. The Lannister family dynamics are probably the most interesting ones of the show. Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey are incredible actors, and they handled the collision of anger and desperation of that scene flawlessly.
AY: I think the really brilliant part about it was the interplay between Cersei’s desire to do the set of actions that will preserve her family, versus doing what she actually wanted to do—which is murder Tyrion. But she knew she needed Dany’s hand to believe that she was going to move her armies.
GL: Tyrion probably believes that there’s still a little bit of soul left in her.
AY: But there’s no soul. That was all acting on both Lena Headey and Cersei’s parts, which is absolutely brilliant.
GL: And also Peter Dinklage. Tyrion is normally the image of calm, of rational thinking, despite having murdered his father and Shae.
AY: Although he has kind of messed up this season. Every piece of major advice he has given has been bad advice this season.
GL: But he’s given it calmly! He’s managed to dole out the condolences for his poor advice calmly! He can keep his cool in the worst of situations—think about how his family has bullied him. Tyrion killing his father was so stunning because no one took him for the violent type. And then in this scene, he puts himself in danger by literally asking Cersei to kill him if she wants to. All of that hurt from being rejected by his own family comes pouring out in these few minutes, and Dinklage doesn’t hold back in this conversation.
AY: What about Jon and Theon’s conversation? What did you think of that?
GL: I did not enjoy Theon’s conversation with Jon. I just thought it wasn’t in Theon’s place to ask for forgiveness. It also wasn’t Jon’s place to grant forgiveness, and he acknowledges that.
AY: It’s the power of love!
GL: Mistakes like Theon’s cannot be erased by a single conversation, but the show writes it like they can—like it’s that easy. He did save Sansa, but he also killed two farm boys, took over Winterfell, and betrayed Robb, who was like a brother to him. His past trauma with Ramsay does not cancel out what he did at Winterfell.
AY: Ramsay’s torture does not invalidate what Theon did.
GL: You can feel sympathy for his past with Ramsay, but you can’t use that as a reason to forgive him for Winterfell. I do like that they’re trying to have Theon redeem himself by saving his sister though, because he hasn’t done much otherwise this season. And his character deserves better writing than that.
AY: The writers are sitting down and deciding that they are not going to let Theon’s past trauma define him, and they’re kind of doing the same with Sansa. But the way that they’re doing that with Theon is not exactly great. He killed some guy who didn’t want to go on a suicide mission to save his sister. You don’t just ask someone to jump off a bridge for you.
And the worst part about this is the way the writers portray the common people. Just because Theon murders someone, means that they will follow him all of a sudden. It’s as if everyone who wasn’t born from a royal family is just a sheep. They’re all murderous sheep.
GL: “Game of Thrones” treats them like they’re disposable.
AY: Exactly, the show seems to say that everyone is disposable unless you’re born with royal blood. That would be fine for the 15th century.
GL: But they’re catering to a modern audience.
AY: Yeah, and it’s like they’re trying to bring back a long dead thought process that should stay dead. They’re romanticizing monarchy. I’m not a fan of monarchy. Do you want to talk about Sansa and Arya?
GL: I really loved the scene right after Littlefinger’s execution, when Sansa and Arya are talking about Ned Stark’s words, “The lone wolf dies but the pack survives.” They’re two very different people, and they acknowledge that in that scene. But they’re together, they’re in Winterfell, and they’re harkening back to the start, paying a sort of homage to “Game of Thrones”’ beginnings.
I wish they ended on this scene, because for me, that felt like the show coming full circle—a fitting conclusion for a family that’s gone through so much. Instead, they threw in a really predictable, anticlimactic, and rather boring White Walker, ice dragon, and wight attack scene.
AY: It was a waste of a climax. There was a better way to do it with a zombie pileup. I am a huge proponent of zombie pileups.
GL: But the ice dragon made things too easy. The ultimate problem of the seventh season finale of “Game of Thrones” is that events were too predictable—we knew Jon and Dany were going to end up together, and we knew that the White Walkers would bring the Wall down. And as mentioned earlier, the writers are heading into a dangerous territory of not being able to kill major characters off. And that doesn’t mean that “Game of Thrones” has to blow up septs or murder favorites in order to keep audiences engaged. They just need more scenes like Tyrion and Cersei’s conversation—scenes that are emotionally complicated enough to add something to the show’s premise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Movie clichés can be useful. One of the most familiar is the army platoon in a World War II movie of soldiers thrown together by the Draft Board and fated to lean on each other in adversity: the poor boy from Brooklyn, the farmer’s son, the rich kid, the intellectual misfit, the Southerner, and so forth. This cliché could actually be used as a model, or at least an inspiration, for an approach to solving some persistent and apparently worsening problems in Harvard’s undergraduate education.
From reading The Crimson, as well as from my own experience as a Harvard graduate, parent, and teacher, it seems that more and more students, particularly first generation students, feel that they somehow do not “belong” at Harvard—that they are a “mistake,” excluded or left behind by more privileged peers.
It also seems that a larger group of students are unsure about the meaning and purpose of a liberal arts education.  They may regard Harvard as a career stepping stone or, more vaguely, a mark of success, but they chafe at General Education requirements and, more broadly, suffer from a high-achievers’ “is-this-all-there-is?” angst.
Finally, I hear from employers (and some faculty) that graduates of elite schools are often surprisingly poor writers. Having taught writing at Princeton for seven years from 2007 to 2014 (and a section of Expos at Harvard in 2005), I saw the struggles of students who were ill-prepared by their high schools to write clearly and cogently.
These are problems without simple solutions, but maybe those old Hollywood war movies suggest the use of a unitary approach to helping students learn from each other as they set out.
Here’s how:  Divide the incoming freshman class into groups of a dozen students. Make sure these groups are diverse in every way—mixing races, genders, and social classes, athletes and actors, scientists and poets. Have them live together, in the same dorm if not the same entryway. Require them to meet for a year-long, full-credit class twice a week to discuss the meaning of a liberal arts education. They should be compelled to grapple with what they want out of their time at Harvard—and to debate, among themselves, guided by a trained teacher, what Harvard wants out of them. The discussions would touch on—and hopefully directly engage—the sort of issues of class, race, and gender that bubble and sometimes seethe beneath the surface of undergraduate life.
These group sessions would supplant Freshman Expository Writing. Students should be required to write every week, and, crucially, to re-write every paper. They should build towards a year-end research paper, but the emphasis should be on clear writing and rigorously thinking through what they are trying to say. About five years ago, I taught a two-week writing course for 50 Harvard sophomores, juniors, and seniors during January Term. I saw repeated examples of very smart students failing to write coherently, regardless of having taken Expos.
Who should teach these groups? Harvard has scores of proctors living in freshmen dorms as well as numerous Expos preceptors. Graduate students living in the Yard and post-docs provide a natural pool of teachers, but they should be hired to teach these small sections only if they are prepared to critique a dozen papers a week, lead wide-ranging (and sometimes fraught) group discussions with firmness and sensitivity, and offer extra counseling and extra writing instruction to those who need it. The teachers should be rigorously trained, generously paid, and held to a high standard. The success or failure of this program would depend on the quality of the teaching.
Historically, by half-acknowledged custom, Harvard has left its students largely alone. Yes, there have long been tutors and advisers, but for many students, the real message has been: Here we are, a magnificent education waiting for you—but you have to come and get it, and don’t blame us if you get lost along the way. This system worked well, or well enough, for many decades. But as Harvard (to its great credit) becomes more inclusive and diverse, more students need a leg up when they arrive. By the same token, the better-off, better prepared students would do well to spend more time directly engaging with students who are truly different from them. In time, students can and will go their own way. But to take advantage of a Harvard education—and each other—first year students should be first required to write and reason together about why they are here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lesson one is simple. Just one word.
Smile.
Smiling is important. More than once, it will make all the difference. Sometimes, it might hurt and you will want to scream or open your mouth instead. But your mother will say it’s not worth it, and she’ll be right (you’ll realize that happens more than you think).
Smiling is especially important when you’re around strangers. Think airports. When the security guard selects you for a random check, smile and follow his directions. When the elderly white woman peers over at you while you’re sitting at the gate, smile back in response to her stone-cold expression. When the flight attendant scans the plane one last time, make sure your tray table is pushed back, your bag is under the chair in front of you, your seatbelt is fastened, and your phone is on airplane mode. Oh, and that you’re smiling, of course.
It sounds comical, and it’s a little annoying, but this is your job now. When you are other, you are performing. You are playing a role in which you’re just a little friendlier than you need to be, just a little happier, just a little more non-threatening. So smile. (Terrorists don’t smile. And you’re not a terrorist, right?)
The next lesson is easy too. It goes with lesson one, because you can do both at the same time. Lesson two is to be comforting.
When someone asks you if you’re Arab and you tell them you’re Pakistani, be ready to accept their apologies. They will tell you, “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to assume.” Assure them that it’s perfectly fine and that you are not upset. In this moment, it is not your place to consider how interesting it is that the scarf on your head and the shade of your skin always lead people to the same peninsula. However, it is your place to comfort the person who made the mistake. You don’t want them to feel bad. In fact, it’s your job to make sure that they don’t.
This applies in other settings as well. One day you will be on the bus and the two white boys in front of you will be making up a song about Muslims and bombs. They will turn around, see you, and turn pale. Laugh along then. Let them know that you understand—they aren’t being offensive, they’re just trying to be funny. They’re middle school boys and they aren’t trying to hurt you. Your job is to play along, not throw the wet towel of political correctness on their humor.
Lesson three is the one you may have to do the most. Lesson three is ignoring it. (This one is another favorite of your mother’s. It makes your blood boil, but she says it keeps you safe.)
Lesson three comes in handy when you’re with your friends. When it happens, remind yourself of these three things: They don’t mean it, they mean well, you don’t want to fight. So when you’re sitting in the cafeteria during your senior year of high school, and a girl you’ve known since you were 11 says slavery needed to happen because it got America to where it is today, ignore her. Don’t remind her that America today is nothing to get excited about. Definitely don’t ask if her reasoning for defending slavery is that it’s a major part of history. Don’t challenge her logic. It will upset your other friends and rock the boat two months before graduation. Instead, remind yourself that she is a good person, that she is kind to you, that she cares for her friends and family. She probably doesn’t even mean what she’s saying.
This lesson comes in handy in class too. After Freddie Gray is murdered, your city will be wracked with protests. The next day, your mother will tell you to stay quiet in school. (She tends to remind you when you need it most.) And when your AP US History teacher tells your class about how they used to trample protesters with horses in the old days, don’t consider what he’s implying. And when he says “that wouldn’t be a bad idea now,” bite your tongue. You want to get into a good college—getting into a fight with a teacher won’t help.
Most importantly, don’t question this reality. Don’t wonder why, in the years that your peers are learning about themselves and the world around them with freedom and excitement, you are learning to know your place. Don’t wonder why you can’t speak up. Don’t wonder why their feelings matter more than your humanity and the humanity of every brown and black person in this country.
Thinking isn’t your job. You are already too other. Your name is hard to pronounce. Your skin is brown. (And yes, it is, no matter how much your one friend who tans like crazy in the summer insists otherwise.) Your religion is synonymous with a violent political ideology. With all the mistakes you’re making simply by existing, you are not in a place to rock the boat.
So smile. Comfort. If neither of those are possible, ignore. It’s three simple steps, but it will teach you how to be other. Being other is about making sure that your otherness doesn’t inconvenience or threaten those around you. It is not about speaking up and demanding space and humanity. After all, what sense would that make?

Last week, The Crimson reported that the Bee and Delphic Clubs will share both membership and a physical space, potentially in response to the Harvard administration’s sanctions on single-gender social organizations. Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Sigma also recently announced their plans to disaffiliate from their national group and become a co-ed organization. These recent decisions raise anew perennial questions about exclusivity and elitism on this campus, compelling us to again query whether merely going co-ed is enough to combat inequality or if further action is needed.
Despite all of the fanfare accompanying the first male and female final club union, becoming co-ed is the bare minimum needed to combat the inequality upon which institutions like final clubs lie. The clubs that have done so should not necessarily be congratulated for it. A transition to gender inclusivity does not guarantee that other forms of discrimination will be addressed. The issues of sexual assault that have plagued these clubs are not guaranteed to be solved by these decisions either. Perhaps most significantly, the class elitism that these groups perpetuate through their social events and policies constitutes a barrier to a considerable portion of the student body. None of these glaring problems will be resolved by clubs simply going quasi-co-ed.
The Bee and Delphic merger suggests that going co-ed is acceptable only if members of both genders have the requisite money, connections, and social capital needed to maintain their historic inequality. Final clubs must do more to fix their imbalances of power and not merely pay lip-service by going co-ed to address the sanctions. While we acknowledge these efforts, including the Fox’s short-lived attempt to go gender-neutral, gender is not the only way in which these groups discriminate.
But while these social organizations attempt to become more inclusive for Harvard’s sake, we must remain cognizant that one of Harvard’s ultimate goals is to shift social life away from unsanctioned spaces to the Houses. To accomplish this, however, the College must make party and social spaces more accessible to students. As we have previously opined, there is a serious deficit of such locations on campus, and of those Houses that do have them, many have byzantine, cost-prohibitive processes to reserve them. There must be a greater push from the College and the House administrators to fix this and provide students with more accessible social outlets.
The choice of some final clubs to go co-ed in response to the sanctions is an unsurprising move, but ultimately one that will do little to combat the myriad ways in which these groups discriminate. Administrators and students alike must keep in mind that only with tangible adjustments to Harvard’s social structure will we finally see welcome changes towards inclusivity.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

The Boston Police Department has arrested a suspect in connection with two stabbings that occurred in Harvard Square last Saturday night.
The BPD arrested 20-year-old Boston native Davongie Stone around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday in connection with a separate non-fatal stabbing in Boston’s Downtown Crossing, according to a citywide alert sent by the Cambridge Police Department Wednesday morning. Police identified Stone as the attacker in the two Harvard Square attacks, which left two victims with non-life threatening stab wounds.
Stone is alleged to have carried out two assaults near John F. Kennedy Park over the weekend, first attacking a Harvard Business School doctoral student and later stabbing a local restaurant employee.
Stone will be charged with two counts of armed assault to murder in Cambridge and one count of armed assault to murder and other charges in Boston, according to CPD. He was scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday.
Police are continuing to search for two others who were reportedly seen accompanying Stone the night of the attacks.

Harvard’s dining halls now boast an expanded set of “make your own” dining options available to undergraduates, including “Poutine Wednesdays,” “Street Taco Mondays,” and “Ancient Grain Bowl Fridays.”
According to Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin, the stations will allow students to assemble their own dishes from pre-prepared ingredients, an expansion of similar stations from last year.
That change is one several HUDS is rolling out with the beginning of the school year. HUDS works to change the menus every year, as well as seasonally in the winter and spring. Student surveys and feedback help inform the menu selections, Martin said.
The dining halls will now be serving a different style of burger each Friday. Sunday evenings now feature a banana split bar, an addition to last year’s Sunday Sundaes. And students in the Houses will occasionally have the chance to try a small portion of a dish not typically found in college dining halls, like a seared scallop or Brazilian beef-stuffed cheese ball, according to Martin.
HUDS has been taking news steps to increase sustainability. The dining hall grills now serve an additional option for a “Grateful Burger” that is a half vegetable and half beef patty.
“The goal is to be a more nutritious and sustainable burger,” she said.
The dining halls will also be piloting a program to pack leftover meals for people who do not have reliable access to food, Martin said. HUDS has traditionally donated leftovers to the nonprofit Food For Free, which then delivers the food to organizations serving the hungry. Starting in about two weeks, though, HUDS will also begin a new program to plate leftover food into prepackaged individual meals for those who need it to bring home. HUDS is currently in the process of hiring a student to lead the program.

Clover Food Lab—the Science Center eatery that replaced Greenhouse Cafe—has opened to mixed reviews, with some students praising the food but others disappointed that the local chain will not take BoardPlus.
The College announced that Clover would move into the renovated Science Center last semester, splitting the student body along culinary lines. Though some students—particularly vegetarians—said they were excited to grab chickpea fritters and pour-over coffee closer to class, others were upset that the fast-food favorite Greenhouse would not be returning.
But beyond the absence of pizza and burritos, some students say they are also frustrated that—due to University rules—Clover will not be able to take BoardPlus, the the automatic $65 per semester loaded onto each student ID and intended to increase flexibility in eating options. Because Clover is not operated by Harvard University Dining Services, students will not be able to spend BoardPlus there, according to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
“Because [BoardPlus] is part of the board program and subject to the relevant tax implications and restrictions surrounding financial aid and educational funding, it cannot be used by non-HUDS operators such as Clover,” Martin wrote in an email. “They are for-profit entities not captured under the same tax rules as a non-profit educational entity.”
However, Clover CEO and founder Ayr Muir said the location will accept Crimson Cash soon.
“We had conversations with Harvard about that and last spring formally requested again that [BoardPlus] be considered, and it’s not something that Harvard is considering,” Muir said. “I’m super sympathetic to people who would love to use BoardPlus, but we can’t do it.”
Still, as a SEAS student who frequently has classes near the Science Center, Rebecca L. Gracia ’18 said she wished the convenient eatery could take BoardPlus.
“As an engineer, it was a little disappointing to see that the Greenhouse space was replaced by somewhere that we couldn’t utilize BoardPlus, especially after long lab hours and if you accidentally worked through the dining hall hours,” Garcia said. “You’re forced to spend money either way, whether that’s at Clover or elsewhere.”
Saskia M. Keller ’18 said that while she enjoys Clover’s food—“I eat there a lot,” she said—she was also disappointed about payment options.
“I immediately heard that they weren’t accepting BoardPlus and that was a little bit disappointing, especially since I used to go to the Greenhouse a lot and use my BoardPlus that way,” she said. “Honestly, this semester I’m not really planning on using very much BoardPlus at all. There isn’t really anywhere I can go.”
The announcement that Clover would occupy prime real estate in a main campus thoroughfare came as a surprise to some: When Greenhouse Cafe closed in summer 2016 during renovations of the Cabot Science Library, a University spokesperson said the cafe would reopen the next year.
Instead, Harvard ended up offering Clover the space. Zachary M. Gingo, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ senior director of facilities operations, wrote in an email that Clover was chosen as “part of an overall effort to re-envision the space” in the Science Center lobby.
“Clover was chosen because its mission, menu, and style of operation meshed well with the programmatic goals of the project,” Gingo wrote.
Muir said the mission of Clover—to be local and sustainable—fit well with Harvard’s interests. He added that Clover looks forward to collaboration with food-oriented courses this fall, for example.
“I think it’s a wonderful, ideal spot for us to be in in terms of the kinds of things we’re interested in pushing forward and connecting with other people who have similar interests,” Muir said. “I’m really excited to have this platform to connect more directly with the student body at Harvard,” he added.=

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2017 at 5:02 p.m.
Amid peaceful protest and a heavy security presence, controversial sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 discussed his scholarship and President Donald Trump’s election at an event intended to “test” the boundaries of free speech on campus.
Murray, whose work alleging race can be linked to IQ disparities has been denounced as “racist pseudoscience” by the Southern Poverty Law Center, spoke to a crowd of nearly 300 at the Harvard Mineralogical and Geological Museum. Outside of the venue, several dozen undergraduates gathered to protest Murray’s appearance at event called “Speak Out Against White Supremacy.”
Protesters criticized the Open Campus Initiative—a group that invites what some say are hateful speakers, including Murray, to speak—for giving a platform to racist ideology.
Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, a member of the Undergraduate Council’s Black Caucus who organized the protest, said that the Open Campus Initiative gave Murray an “unchecked platform for white supremacy and transphobia” by inviting him to campus.
Taya Cowan ’21, another protester, said she felt that Murray’s sentiments should not be welcome at Harvard’s campus, and that his invitation reaffirmed her belief that “the world isn’t safe” for her as a black woman.
Conor Healy ’19, the president of the Open Campus Initiative, said Wednesday that the group “only invite[s] people whom we believe have something to add to academic and intellectual discourse on this campus.”
Inside the lecture hall, Murray discussed his most recent book, “Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010,” which looks to analyze modern-day class dynamics in the United States.
While fielding pre-screened questions from the audience, Murray responded to one student who asked outright whether he was a white supremacist.
His response was brusque: “I am sick unto death of trying to prove a negative,”  he said, adding that he thought his best-known book “The Bell Curve,” which claims that disparities in intelligence can be linked to race, does not actually claim that white men are intellectually superior to other groups.
Midway through Murray’s talk, about ten students in the audience rose and held signs, one of them reading “white nationalist,” before walking out of the lecture to attend a faculty panel organized by the nearby protesters.
At the faculty panel, hosted directly after the student protest, History and African and African American Studies professor Walter Johnson strongly condemned Murray’s beliefs.
“Charles Murray is like a Confederate statue on wheels,” he said. “His work is empirically discredited, overtly racist, and over twenty years old, a relic of the culture wars of the 1990s.”
The counter-events were tame compared to the demonstration sparked by a speech Murray was scheduled to give at Middlebury College in March. Still, the memory of the Middlebury incident, which drew national attention and briefly turned violent, cast a shadow over the event.
Murray himself joked about his Middlebury appearance after the students who held up signs departed the room.
“This is way better than Middlebury,” Murray said. “I appreciate the way that was done.”
And after the event, Murray Tweeted, “Harvard did itself proud. Attentive audience, tough questions, super-professional security. Congrats & thanks to @harvardfree.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a flood of cheating cases roiled Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” last year, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris implored students in the course not to cheat on assignments at an orientation session Wednesday night.
Course head David J. Malan ’99 introduced Harris as a “surprise visitor” to scattered applause and muttering among the 300-odd attendees. The dean spoke for roughly 20 minutes near the end of the session, repeatedly and bluntly warning against cheating. At one point, he asked the entire room to read CS50’s roughly 1,500-word academic honesty policy—slowly and silently, just to themselves.
“No one should leave this room not understanding 100 percent what it is that you may and may not do in this course,” Harris said, adding that cheating is “boneheaded.”
The unusual presentation follows a cheating scandal in the course that stretched the Honor Council—the body that enforces Harvard’s Honor Code—to its limits. Last year, 60 CS50 enrollees appeared before the Council to face charges of academic dishonesty. Wednesday’s orientation session is one of several changes Malan made to the course this semester, though he has said his decision to update CS50 is “unrelated” to the high levels of cheating last year.
Earlier in the session, held in Harvard’s Science Center, Malan walked students through the course schedule, expectations, and resources. Just before introducing Harris, Malan briefly reviewed the course’s academic honesty guidelines—which he summarized as “be reasonable.”
Malan also explained the software CS50 uses to check for academic dishonesty. First, a computer program compares current student problem sets against all problem sets ever submitted to the class to find and flag similarities, Malan said. After that, course staffers examine the flagged cases to determine which are genuine.
The software made more than five million comparisons and identified roughly 200 matches last semester, Malan said. Course staff, including Malan himself, eventually whittled that number down to the more than 60 individual cases he reported to the Honor Council.
“That’s ultimately what got referred to the Honor Council,” Malan said—the only reference he made to last semester’s widespread cheating throughout the hour-long meeting.
Harris took a different approach.
“Malan mentioned it rather obliquely, but there are a number of students right now who are not here at Harvard College because they cut enough corners [to] actually have been asked to leave the College for a year in many cases,” he said after taking the stage.
Harris urged students to think through the situation “rationally” and reflect that cheating on a problem set to get a slightly better grade in the short term will “make your life miserable” later on. He added that in his mind students increasingly treat class academic guidelines much like the terms and conditions “for some app.”
“What I’m going to ask you to do right now is to actually read the policy for this course in its entirety, and then we’re going to take a few minutes to ask, is there anything you truly do not understand?” Harris said.
Harris then nodded to Malan, who pulled up the CS50 academic policy page on the projector at the front of the lecture hall. For the next three minutes, Malan scrolled slowly through the guidelines while students watched the screen in total silence, and Harris watched the students.
He spoke up the minute attendees finished reading.
“Is there anything here that you find unclear?” he asked. Hands went up across the lecture hall.
Malan spent the last five minutes of the orientation session fielding questions from students confused about the course’s collaboration policy and whether or not CS50 enrollees are allowed to use code found online. He told them never to Google solutions, and never to borrow a friend’s work.
After the session ended, at least two dozen students lined up in front of the course staff at the front of the lecture hall to keep asking questions.
Malan declined an in-person request for an interview Wednesday night. Neither he nor Harris responded to an emailed list of questions about the event Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 7, 2017 at 3:13 p.m.
While many of their classmates worry about election to one of Harvard’s exclusive social groups, two Harvard students are spending their sophomore falls vying for membership to a slightly different set of historic organizations: the Cambridge City Council and Cambridge School Committee.
Earlier this year, Will H. MacArthur ’20, a candidate for the School Committee, and Nadya T. Okamoto ’20, a candidate for City Council, launched their respective electoral efforts. After spending their summers in the area campaigning, each candidate will continue to sell Cambridge voters on electing college students to help run their city ahead of the November election.
The Cambridge City Council is legislative arm of the city, while the Cambridge School Committee is in charge of budgeting and policies for the local school districts.
MacArthur, who’s proud of the fact he’s been living in Cambridge since infancy, said that most of his summer was spent with his team preparing for the fall.
“I had a lot of great conversations with teachers, who had a lot more free time, and also just with parents and other residents, just so that I can make sure that my platform was exactly where I wanted it to be,” he said.
His team is composed entirely of recent alumni and students of Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, something MacArthur said has helped shape his platform. MacArthur said his platform is focused on on engaging teachers, closing the “opportunity gap” for students and teachers of color, and including students from a variety of backgrounds, especially BGLTQ students.
“Students in Cambridge public schools are not quiet,” he said. “The problem is more that there’s not always someone there to listen to them...I think the experience that I bring as a recent graduate is one of the more unique things that I offer to the race.”
Okamoto, a native of Portland, Ore., has focused her campaign on lower housing prices, one of the dominant issues in Cambridge politics. She also spent a portion of her campaign focusing on making politics more age-inclusive, receiving an endorsement from “Run for Something,” a national progressive group that supports young candidates.  
Both College candidates emphasized the importance of participating in the election, pointing to the lack of participation in the previous municipal elections: In 2015, only 8.2 percent of registered voters ages 21-23 in Cambridge voted in the municipal election.
If elected, MacArthur said he will take time off from college. Okamoto has also previously said she would taking time off from school if necessary.
The Cambridge Municipal Election will be held on November 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity is now a new, gender-neutral group called the Aleph, its president Jake H. Ascher ’19 said Wednesday night.
Following through on plans announced in April, Ascher said freshmen will be able to join the Aleph without being subject to Harvard’s newly-implemented policy penalizing members of single-gender Greek organizations and final clubs.
“While freshmen may be weary to try out some other organizations that they could possibly be sanctioned for joining, they shouldn’t feel that way about us,” Ascher said. “I would especially encourage all freshmen to at least come and try out the Aleph and see what we're all about, because there’s not going to be any punishment for that.”
The policy, starting with the Class of 2021, makes students who join such groups ineligible for several post-graduate fellowships and scholarships, campus leadership positions, and team captaincies.
The Aleph, named for the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, will retain its Jewish cultural identity while allowing all students regardless of gender or faith background to participate in its open recruitment process, Ascher said.
“We are a culturally Jewish organization,” Ascher said. “So we felt that by choosing a name that incorporates a Hebrew letter of the alphabet, we would always be reminded of this aspect of our organization.”
The group also chose the name for its similarity to the letter Alpha. Although the new organization cut ties with the national Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity after going gender-neutral, Ascher said they wanted their new name to reflect the group’s history.
“We wanted in our name for there to be a reminder of who we were, and what our organization was,” Ascher said.
Last spring, Harvard’s Alpha Epsilon Pi became the first of Harvard’s nine Greek organizations to adopt gender-neutral membership policies after the College began penalizing joining the groups.
College administrators met with the Aleph’s leadership before and during their transition to a gender-neutral organization last semester, Ascher said. At the time, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana praised the group for becoming “more equitable and inclusive.”
All roughly 40 former Alpha Epsilon Pi members now belong to the new organization, which does not currently own property. Alumni of Harvard’s AEPi chapter are also considered alumni of The Aleph.
Last week, Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Sigma took similar steps, announcing it had disaffiliated from its national organization and formed an independent gender-neutral group called the KS.
Both the KS and the Aleph plan to hold a gender-neutral rush process this fall.
Ascher said the group cannot anticipate how many non-male students will be interested in rush. Unlike years prior, however, the group plans to publicize the rush process widely, and inform students of how the sanctions will impact them.
“If people come to our events they're going to see who we are, they're going to have a good time, and they're going to hopefully join the organization,” he said.
Ascher said the group plans to get its rush underway the week of Sept. 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Thursday, for the first time since winning the Ivy League Championship in November, the Harvard women’s soccer team will return to Jordan Field to play cross-town rival Boston College. Days later, the Crimson will travel to Syracuse to challenge the Orange on Sunday.
“BC and Syracuse are both great programs in the ACC,” co-captain Caroline Chagares said. “We are looking forward to using them as a challenge and opportunity to get better and to see where we are.”
Coming off an exciting double overtime win against St. John’s to win the CCSU tournament, Harvard (3-1) looks to continue building momentum before entering Ivy League play.
BOSTON COLLEGE
Harvard and Boston College last faced off exactly one year ago, when the Eagles (4-2) secured a commanding 3-0 victory. However, the Crimson is not the same team it was a year ago. The graduation of standout forward Midge Purce, who has since been called up to play for the U.S. Women’s National Team, leaves an offensive void for Harvard to fill.
“After losing a large and talented senior class, all of the returning and new players have had to step up,” Chagares said. “These games are a great opportunity to build our team chemistry and to get used to playing with each other.”
Strong play from both freshmen and upperclassmen has helped to fill the the gap left the senior class. Junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi already has two goals on the season, both game-winners, and freshman forward Murphy Agnew tallied her first score against Central Connecticut State in the first game of the CCSU tournament.
“Coming into the season we knew we would have a new-look team with a lot of players who graduated, freshman coming into the mix,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “One of our goals this preseason was to come together and create that chemistry which is really important to being successful and our upperclassmen did a really good job of welcoming the freshmen.”
Boston College has also had a successful season thus far, most recently earning a narrow 2-1 victory against Northeastern, the only team to which the Crimson has fallen this season. Sophomore forward Jenna Bike leads the Eagles offensively, racking up four goals in just six games this season. BC’s other threat comes in the form of freshman forward Sam Coffey, who has two goals and a team-leading four assists on the season.
Bike and Coffey will provide a good challenge for Harvard’s defense, which has been consistently strong this season, allowing just two goals and posting three shutouts.
Both Hamblin and assistant coach Mike Calise played for the Boston College men’s soccer team all four years as undergraduates, graduating from BC in 2001 and 1997 respectively. Hamblin then went on to serve as associate head coach of the Eagles’ women’s soccer team from 2001 through 2009.
Despite this familiarity, Harvard will prepare for this game as it would for any other. “We want to compete, we want to win, we want to put on our best performance,” Hamblin said. “It’s going to be a good opportunity for us to really see where we’re at.”
SYRACUSE
Sunday’s game against Syracuse will also serve as good test for the Crimson, as the two teams have not faced each other in 12 years, when Harvard came away with a narrow 1-0 win.
The Orange (4-1-1) has gotten off to a hot start this season, recording over ten shots in five of its six games, as well as posting three shutouts. Sophomore forward Sydney Brackett and freshman midfielder Kate Donovan lead Syracuse with four and three goals respectively, and senior goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan has put on an impressive showing with 18 saves on the season.
This recent success marks an improvement from last season, when the Orange finished with a 8-8-3 record and missed the ACC playoffs.
“Syracuse is a much improved team who has had a really good start to the year with some good results,” Hamblin said.  “On the video we’ve seen they look really deep, and for us the game is all about getting ready for Ivy League competition and making sure that we’re making improvements along the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­After tallying three tough losses to open the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team will battle for its first win of the year this weekend as it takes on three Midwest schools.
The Crimson (0-3) will travel to Dayton, Ohio as an invitee to the Holiday Inn Invitational, its first ever appearance at the Wright State University-hosted tournament.
“Our goals heading forward are to play as well as we can together and as a unit,” co-captain Christina Cornelius said, “I love to lead by example and in any situation or time of need I want to be there for my teammates.”
The first few games of the season have been an adjustment period for Harvard, as the team seeks to acclimate its younger players onto the squad and solidify positions.
Despite the lack of victories in its first tournament, several underclassmen at last week’s Harvard Invitational made important contributions to the Crimson’s attacking and defense. Sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank contributed 18 kills over the course of three games, while freshman libero Sydney Vach totaled 48 digs.
“Our freshmen are great additions to the team,” Cornelius said. “They came into our first tournament super fired up and super ready to go. I felt they were not afraid to challenge the upperclassmen which I find is really inspiring. Their competitiveness definitely keeps us on our toes.”
Due to this infusion of youth talent on the Harvard roster, it will be even more critical for veteran leaders to be mentors for the four freshmen and five returning sophomores.
“I definitely want to step up as a leader a bit more since I am the oldest player on the team,” said senior outside hitter Paige Kebe. “I want to leave senior year with no regrets and using that experience to lead this team is definitely a big goal of mine.”
With a week of game experience under its belt, the Crimson will be preparing to take on three non-conference opponents this Friday and Saturday.
The lone Friday match will feature Harvard against host Wright State, which will be playing its ninth match of the season when they face off against the Crimson.
The Raiders (2-5), have had a challenging schedule so far in the season, kicking off the campaign with bouts against Long Beach State in a late August tournament as well as a contest against the nation’s No. 2 ranked team in Stanford.
Although it failed to earn a single point in that tournament, Wright State has gone 2-2 since. Carried on offense by senior hitter Katie Klusman with 80 season kills, Harvard will need to control its defensive efforts and hold the Raiders below their current average of 12 kills per set.
On Saturday, the Crimson will match up against West Virginia and Tennessee Tech. Both teams have two tournaments under their belt, with the Mountaineers (4-2) holding a better record than the Golden Eagles (2-4).
Playing in the challenging Big 12 conference, West Virginia finished 12-18 last year. The Mountaineers encountered an Ivy League opponent just one time in the 2016-2017 season. In that sole contest, Dartmouth fell 3-0 to West Virginia.
Harvard’s final opponent of the weekend, Tennessee Tech, is also searching for some positive momentum over the weekend.
Carrying a four-game losing streak, the Golden Eagles come into the Holiday Inn Invitational as underdogs and will need to rely upon an improvement in their 0.125 hitting percentage for any success against their larger conference opponents.
For the Crimson, the focus will be on gradually finding the comfort zone for all players. This sentiment was echoed by senior leaders like Kebe, who commented that making adjustments and building team chemistry will be critical for Harvard’s success moving forward.
In finding this sweet spot, the Crimson hopes that tacking on a few wins will help advance its process.  The end goal: claiming an Ivy League championship.
