After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students like to hear themselves talk, and oftentimes they like to read about themselves talking, too. The latter, however, proved false at last week’s explicitly “OFF the record” meeting about the exclusivity of campus social spaces.
The event, organized by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, took place in the Winthrop Junior Common Room, lasted about two hours, and drew around 100 attendees. These 100 came from all corners of campus. Some belonged to final clubs, some to fraternities and sororities, some to other societies and publications on campus. So many different perspectives rarely meet in one place at Harvard, and when they do they rarely discuss the root cause of that infrequency—or what we can do about it.
For that reason, this meeting was nothing if not valuable. Campus organizations suffering from a lack of diversity do occasionally hold in-house conversations about present problems and possible solutions. But, since these discussions take place within the very organizations that could benefit from increased inclusivity, they necessarily do not benefit from as wide a range of viewpoints as they could. (The Crimson certainly falls under this category.) Last week’s larger discussion provided that range, and in doing so it offered each attendee a chance both to hear something new and to be heard by someone new.
Because these conversations are so few and far between, it makes sense that those who spearheaded the meeting discouraged the press from attending—students likely feel less comfortable expressing their views and disclosing their organizational affiliations when they fear that their names might appear in print the next day. That said, just as a more ideal future includes more of these conversations, such a future also entails an environment where students are unafraid of putting themselves forward, and opening themselves and their clubs up to criticism in the interest of improvement and inclusion.
The problems the meeting sought to address permeate structures, social and otherwise, throughout Harvard. The moment freshmen walk through Johnston Gate, they watch groups form before their eyes—groups that depend on where students grew up or went to school, and groups that become closed off, or appear that way, to newly-minted Harvardians even before shopping week ends.
These problems are far from easy to solve. A real solution will take more than action on the part of organizations to change their comp or punch processes. It will take more than action on the part of the University to admit a more diverse pool of students or offer better trainings and discussions. It will take more than action on the part of individuals to sit at different tables in Annenberg, to actively seek out different people as friends and conversation partners, or to join not the groups that seem the easiest, or the most natural, but rather the groups about which they are the most passionate.
Exclusivity on campus has no panacea. Instead, students and administrators alike treat it mostly with platitudes (like some of the above, perhaps). But a broad-based conversation on the topic is at least an effort, and a first step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Pre-Frosh,
I know this past weekend, Visitas weekend, was very exciting for you.
I’m sure you really enjoyed not going to Yardfest, the college’s only fun school-wide gathering besides the Harvard-Yale game. I’m sure you really liked the following night, when you went with your freshman hosts to a party in a sweaty, cramped room in the quad, after they got a text saying “Pfohoo beltower. Itx’s fzunn!” And I’m sure you really enjoyed the next day, when your hosts were busy, so you spent 10 hours twiddling your thumbs in awkward small-talk and silence with another pre-frosh named Doug.
Yeah, no one likes Doug.
And, yeah, no one really likes Visitas. The meet-and-greets seem hollow. The atmosphere seems strange. And it doesn’t give you  the best impression of what it’s really like to be a Harvard student.
Like every Pre-Frosh, I’m sure you were also admitted to 52 other Ivy League schools. Plus, you probably have acceptances to several safety schools, like Yale College. With all those options to choose from, you may have some doubts about Harvard.
Of course, this weekend spoon-fed you with some good reasons to come here: “Wow, they have world-class professors in every field.” “Wow, they have terrific students from a variety of backgrounds.” “Wow, they have fantastic…OH MY GOD THE WAFFLE MAKERS HAVE THE LOGO ON THEM!”
That stuff is cool and all. But it can’t hide the fact that Visitas felt a little weird, strange, and somewhat empty. Harvard doesn’t feel like home yet. And, what’s worse, with the distinguished classmates, the intimidating world-class professors, and the pomp and circumstance, Harvard doesn’t feel like it could ever have the comfort of home. And that’s unsettling.
But, before you make your decision, let me tell you a little story. Maybe it’ll change your mind.
As I was sitting down to write this column, my roommate Andrew had a suggestion: “Yo, do you want to duel?” We had some water guns in our room. I agreed.
The plan was to go outside and start fighting. But, as we walked out our door, I preemptively shot Andrew in the face. That’s when things got interesting. He pursued. We ran down the stairs, opening hallway doors for cover. As he came after me, I’d fire a few shots and then retreat further down the steps. After a standoff outside, during which I tasted Andrew’s sweet water of vengeance several times, we ended in a stalemate.
As we headed back, to our surprise, our friend Zak emerged from his room. He wielded not one, but two water guns. Because of the extra fire (water?) power, we settled our squabbles and teamed up against him. Eventually, Zak slipped into our room. There, he joined forces with our roommate Tank (appropriately nicknamed), who had just gotten back from class.
There we were. Locked out. And there they were. Locked in. We could hear a bit of chatter. But not much else. We decided to wait them out. But it was of no use. They had enough Ramen noodles in there to last them until dinner time.
We had to go in.
We made a plan. In the outer hallway, strangely enough, we found a thin piece of wood. This would serve as my shield. I’d be the point man and Andrew would file in close behind. The plan set, I pounded on the door: “SWAT team, open up!”
No answer.
“I said open up!”
Nothing.
I put the key in the door. We threw it open.
Splash!
“Grenade! Grenade!”
Tank had filled up three water cups. As we entered, he emptied their contents in our direction. Thankfully, the shield blocked most of it.
We worked our way inside, our shuffled feet pattering on the flooded floor. We came in firing (watering?). It all happened in a blur. But we made it in.
After we had some screams and some fun, a stalemate was drawn. We threw in the towel. And, subsequently, threw some towels on the floor to clean up the mess.
***
At Visitas, we talk about how Harvard is different from other schools. Those differences are supposed to distinguish us. They’re supposed to give us an advantage.
But the message of difference can hurt us. It makes Harvard seem like a cold, distant, and alien institution that, while impressive, is strange. It’s uncomfortable. And it doesn’t feel like home.
The relity is that for every Harvard student, once a little time goes by, the “world-class” professors become teachers. The prestigious red-bricks become libraries. And the impressive peers become familiar friends.
Sure, the students, professors, and history are impressive. But the majority of the student experience isn’t about the impressiveness. It’s about the long nights laughing with friends in the dorm rooms. It’s about the thoughtful bike ride on the Charles on a lazy afternoon. It’s about the fun meet-ups, the joking put-downs, the scandalous hook-ups, and the raging throw-downs. And, most importantly, it’s about spontaneous water gun fights with your roommates to kick off the weekend on a spring day.
And once you add those more familiar experiences to the list of things on the Visitas brochure…
Well, I don’t know why you’d go anywhere else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Community” is all the rage at Harvard. It's a buzzword. To foster a close-knit residential community is one of the high ideals of this university. It's why we live in the same dorms and eat the same meals. It's the very spirit of collegiality.
Yet, so often Harvard is a lonely place, and talk of “community” seems uncertain and hollow.
Often we use “community” to refer to a group of like-minded people interested in pursuing a common goal. That is the model around which social life is generally structured here. We organize ourselves socially around extracurricular activities—producing  publications or theatrical performances, participating in service projects, hosting speaker events—whose primary aim is to get things done. The fact that there are other people around who are similar to me and want to get the same things done is a happy accident which allows me to get more and better things done than I would have by myself.
But getting things done, while a perfectly respectable and worthwhile goal, is awfully inadequate as the basic structure of community life. Social life begins to look (and feel) rather pitiful if it is just an extension of my resume.
What if people are not merely a more efficient means for me to get things done?
Perhaps community would start happening if I did not think so much of myself. Yes. I should be more selfless. I should invest more in the people around me. That is the basic moral vision necessary to build up a community. We should care about others more than we care about ourselves.
But bugger it all! In talking about “my” selflessness, my personal individual virtue of selflessness (or lack thereof), I'm talking about myself again. While it's not exactly selfish of me to think about my own efforts to be selfless, there remains something uncomfortably oxymoronic about this situation.
This paradox is probably why the “V” word—virtue, that is—is so unfashionable nowadays. Insofar as virtue is a property of individuals, it sounds like obsessive navel-gazing—even though the highest of virtues is selflessness.
Selflessness is a difficult moral vision to achieve. The me me me always creeps right back in.
What's all the fuss about? Isn't it a perfectly normal, inevitable, banal fact that I happen to be at the center of my own thoughts, because, well, I'm me?
Perhaps so. But the me me me runs very deep, and it takes many forms besides hubris. There's a place near the beginning of Notes from Underground where the unstable narrator diagnoses himself with the disease of too much consciousness. Excessive self-consciousness is another, quite different kind of me me me problem. It's another way of ending up isolated and lonely—cringingly, ashamedly so.
Here at Harvard, we are scarily effective at reinforcing our own isolation in a thousand subtle ways. Like triumphantly packing our schedules with getting things done so as to enjoy the power trip of saying “No” to people who want to spend time with us.
And this is another kind of obstacle to achieving community.
How can we possibly escape the predicament of me me me?
I hope that someday the first thought to pass through my head when I wake up in the morning will not be “What shall I do today?” but rather, “What shall we do today?”
Thinking as “we” makes all the difference.
Thinking as “we” means that the first thing on our minds would be the wolf-pack of people to whom we belonged and to whom we were committed, prior to any particular plan, activity, or goal. People are not merely a means towards getting things done.
Thinking as “we” means that we aspire to be less like a committee of separate persons and more like a living, breathing, organic unity. The life of the community as a whole becomes our aim. We break out of isolating self-consciousness.
Thinking as “we” opens up moral possibilities that are unrealizable if I am thinking as “I.”
This, incidentally, is why the church is so important in Christianity.
Yes, organized religion is uncool. But, pace the “spiritual, but not religious,” Christianity has always stubbornly insisted that the communal life of the church is central to the faith. Christianity is no solo sport.
And when Christians think and live as “we”—however imperfectly—boy, does it look beautiful.
Campus ministers at Harvard have risen to the challenge of living as “we.” The home of Nick and Kasey Nowalk is virtually never without guests—typically filled with students in need of a place to crash for a few months—whilst Mako and Ming Nagasawa's experimental urban living community has now expanded to include three houses and a community garden.
The Church has its many flaws. But thinking as “we” means we don't give up on the pack, even when they seem to be insufferably stupid, petty, snivelly, weird, prejudiced, homophobic, hypocritical… Well, you get the idea.
Thinking as “we” means that when things go wrong with our dumb-ass Church, we try (with God's help) to fix them. Fixing dumb-ass, broken relationships is, after all, the very essence of redemption.
The Christian vision, both for this life and the next, is a beautiful community, a holy city, Zion. They say it this way in the Russian Orthodox Church: “One can be damned alone, but saved only with others.”
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

An interim report on the current program in General Education, released internally to Faculty members at the beginning of March, shows that some administrators, professors, and students are dissatisfied with aspects of the program, according to Gen Ed review committee chair Sean D. Kelly.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss the report at their next monthly meeting on May 5. It was compiled by a committee tasked with reviewing the Gen Ed program, although Kelly has declined to share the report and its findings with The Crimson.
Kelly, who is also chair of the Philosophy department, wrote in an email last week that the committee received feedback from many faculty members, who had suggestions to ameliorate the current program.
“[The interim report] reported on a number of dissatisfactions with the program from its various constituencies: the students, the teaching fellows, the faculty, and the administrators,” Kelly wrote. “The report [canvassed] a range of possible ways to respond to these dissatisfactions.”
Over the last few weeks, the Gen Ed review committee met with more than a dozen Faculty and administrative groups—including individual academic departments and a committee tasked with studying the diversity of the curriculum—to discuss the program, according to Kelly.
Kelly wrote that the faculty “responded generously and enthusiastically” with feedback about the report and the Gen Ed program more broadly.
At the Faculty meeting on May 5, the Gen Ed review committee will share the results from these conversations. Kelly wrote that the committee plans to have a final report on the program ready sometime in the fall.

With the goal of raising awareness about malaria, Harvard College Students Against Malaria attempted Saturday to break a world record for the longest chain of glowsticks by linking more than 10,000 glowsticks together in the Science Center Plaza. The event, entitled the "Harvard One Campaign," coincided with World Malaria Day.
According to Mohammed A. Toure ’16, co-founder and co-president of SAM, the group aimed to “do something fun and cool and to raise awareness for malaria.” He said he hoped the event would educate more people about malaria and inspire people to continue working against the issue.
Toure added that the Office of Student Life approved SAM last fall semester, and the student organization has since been “working hard in organizing activities that will inform people.”
The glowsticks, while used to break a world record, symbolized “shedding light” on an issue that “affects half the world’s population,” Toure said. The attendees connected more than 10,000 glowsticks, which would beat the current record of the longest chain of glowsticks at 9,021 glowsticks; the group awaits confirmation from Guinness World Records, according to Toure.
Kimberly S. Mihayo ’15, an event organizer, emphasized the importance of educating the community about the issue.
“The biggest goal for us is to engage the Harvard community and to get everybody to come together,” she said.
Since the event was held in the Science Center Plaza, some attendees said they found it easy to take part, and that they considered the event informative.
For her part, Nadia L. Urrea ’17 said that she thought the glowsticks served as an effective informational tool.
“Today I’ve learned that there are a lot more deaths from malaria that most people are aware of,” she said.
Dami A. Aladesanmi ’15 said that once people “understand why the lights are being put together, they will get a feel for what the issue is.”

In the midst of a debate over Title IX implementation nationwide and within the University, the federal government published guidance on Friday that could strengthen the role of Title IX coordinators at many schools, including Harvard.
In three separate documents, which combined span over 40 pages, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights clarified the role of Title IX coordinators, who are responsible for ensuring institutions receiving federal funding comply with Title IX, an anti-sex discrimination law. The guidance adds to efforts by the government to clarify Title IX requirements, including the release of Title IX policy recommendations last April.
The documents lay out many recommendations for the training and function of the position, including a requirement that the institution specify a commitment to complying with Title IX on all “recruitment materials," including applications and bulletins. The guidance also states that recipients of federal funding should provide Title IX coordinators with “access to information regarding enrollment in particular subject areas, participation in athletics, administration of school discipline, and incidents of sex-based harassment.”
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email that the University is currently “reviewing the guidance and will discuss with OCR any necessary updates.”
Taken in sum, the guidance more explicitly emphasizes the authority and importance of Title IX coordinators, according to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
“It is a signal that the regulatory interventions will continue to come,” said Lake, who is also an interim Title IX coordinator at Stetson. “This was definitely significant guidance; this was not a blip on the screen.”
Lake added that the guidance, with its emphasis on the need for the Title IX coordinator’s autonomy and direct access to institutional leadership, places the Title IX coordinator in a uniquely powerful position to enforce legal compliance. The guidance stipulates that the institution “must not interfere” with the duties of the Title IX coordinator to ensure compliance.
“It's essentially unprecedented in federal regulatory law to put so much power of the federal government behind the protection of an administrative employee of the University,” Lake said.
At least one of the specific recommendations, that universities appoint independent Title IX coordinators, could be in tension with the College’s current operations. While the letter states that the government does not “categorically exclude” any particular university employee from serving as a Title IX coordinator, it cautions against conflicts of interests that could arise when administrators such as disciplinary board members, deans of students, and general counsel attorneys double up on the role.
William Cooper ’94 and Emily J. Miller serve as the College’s Title IX coordinators, in addition to their positions as Associate Dean of Student Life and case manager for the College’s disciplinary body, respectively. Neither Cooper nor Miller, who is not a member of the Administrative Board and does not participate in cases that she has previously addressed in her capacity as Title IX coordinator, could be reached for comment. Many other schools within the University, including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School, have appointed Title IX coordinators who also serve in roles as administrators of student affairs.
Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX Officer who heads the office, could not be reached for comment. DeLuzuriaga  wrote that “whenever a situation may present a real or perceived conflict of interest for a local Title IX coordinator, Title IX responsibilities are shifted or the employee may be recused.”
Organizers for Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy group that spurred a now open Title IX investigation at the College, said the College’s use of Title IX coordinators who also serve in other roles could present a problem.
“In the abstract, it’s quite certainly a concern…. It’s not great,” said Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer for the group.
Last week, OCR attorneys visited campus to solicit student input for the ongoing federal probe into the College’s Title IX compliance.

Chinese business leaders discussed their experiences in opening and operating businesses within China at the annual Harvard China Forum last weekend.
Speeches and panels fell under this year’s theme of “defining the Chinese dream,” and addressed the challenges of entrepreneurship in China.
This weekend featured several panels pertaining to a variety of sectors and industries within the country, such as asset management, travel, fashion, culture, and media. The Forum concluded with speeches at the closing ceremony Sunday afternoon in Memorial Church.
Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, a large e-commerce company in China, spoke about his initial struggles and path to eventual success with his startup at the opening ceremony. Liu also offered advice to other entrepreneurs attempting to get their startups off the ground.
“Every startup needs to ask, ‘what problem will I solve?’” he said, speaking through a translator.
Eric Wang ’15 and Sabrina M. Castenfelt  ’15, co-presidents of Harvard China Forum, the student organization founded in 1998 that puts on the conference, said that HCF aims to assist in establishing a dialogue between the United States and China.
Castenfelt said that for future conferences, she hopes that the discussions within the forum will serve to address the constantly changing relations between China and the United States.
“Our conference, we hope, will reflect the change in that dialogue,” said Castenfelt.
The closing ceremony began with a speech by Su Mang, the CEO of Trends Media Group, a Chinese media company. In addition to Mang serving as the executive publisher of Harper’s Bazaar in China, Trends Media owns several magazines including the Chinese editions of Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, and Esquire.
Also a speaker at the closing ceremony, Yu Weiping serves as the vice president of China CNR Corporation, a state-owned enterprise that manufactures locomotives. CNR won the bid to upgrade the cars on the Red and Orange lines of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
He added that the company will provide more than 280 cars during the next five years for the two lines. The new cars will be assembled in Springfield, Mass., where China CNR will build an assembly plant.
Mr. Weiping poked fun at the Red line, claiming that the sounds and unevenness of the journey reminded him of his first train ride when he was 15 years old.
To the local residents present at the event, he said, speaking through a translator, “You all only have to suffer for five more years.”

Undergraduate Council representatives expressed mixed opinions about Ventfull, the smartphone application that the Council spent $1,200 to bring to Harvard, at their general meeting Sunday.
Questions about Ventfull came as the UC’s Evaluation Task Force, charged with compiling a report on new Council initiatives, decided to recommend continued support of the application. Seven out of 12 task member votes were cast in favor of the calendar application.
According to the report compiled by the task force, a separate Student Relations Committee report indicated that “while the idea of Ventfull was good in intention, there was general agreement that it was not being used by the campus.” In addition, the Student Relations Committee’s report encouraged the Council to look into the use of a “free alternative that is already widely used,” such as Google Calendar.
In contrast to the Evaluation Task Force’s voting results, when asked if the Council should continue to support and fund Ventfull, zero members of the Student Relations Committee voted yes, with seven voting no and one abstaining.
Student Life Committee Chair Oliver W. Kim ’16 said that the analytics provided by the report “do not tell the story of an app widely used by the student body,” and that Ventfull does not “warrant further time and resources of the Council.” Kim is a Crimson editorial writer.
UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 argued that Ventfull is worth funding and endorsement, adding that the app remains populated long after the Council’s initial push for publicity earlier this semester. According to Goyal, the app also addresses key campus issues such as accessibility and inclusivity. A “tag” for events with full accessibility was recently incorporated into the calendar.
“We’re totally not there yet,” Winthrop House representative and Crimson news writer Daniel R. Levine ’17 said. Levine conducted a survey of 47 students in Winthrop House, with 44 of the students saying that they either do not use or do not know about the app. Levine also expressed his belief that much more time and effort needs to be committed for a “paradigm shift” regarding Ventfull.
Former Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who attended the meeting, said Ventfull does not currently work “in a way people want it to,” and pointed to the Class of 2019 as solutions to shifting the paradigm towards Ventfull.
This semester, Council leadership spearheaded a two-pronged application package, including Ventfull and Omni, a reboot of the official Harvard application set to launch later this week.
In a meeting in January, Goyal and UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 said the app package would be one of their priorities in their first semester as leaders.
An official decision on Ventfull will take place next semester, when representatives will vote on legislation to reappropriate funds towards the app, according to UC Parliamentarian Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the website WikiLeaks published a database of emails that were hacked last fall from Sony Pictures Entertainment, communications involving Michael M. Lynton ’82, the company’s chief executive officer and a Harvard Overseer, were made public, offering a rare glimpse into his relationship with top administrators at Harvard.
Lynton, according to the emails published in searchable form by WikiLeaks earlier this month, is heavily involved in Harvard business both in his capacity as a member of the University’s second-highest governing body and as a donor and active alumnus.
Sony has condemned the site’s decision to publish the messages, a sentiment that Lynton echoed in an interview last week.
The Crimson decided to report on a select few of the released emails because they detail the inner workings of Harvard’s administration and fundraising apparatus during the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign.
According to the emails, Lynton helped plan a number of events for Harvard, including a large capital campaign event for affiliates of Harvard Business School and a dinner for University President Drew G. Faust hosted at his home in Los Angeles. Lynton, an alumnus of the College and the Business School, has also donated regularly to Harvard, particularly to arts and humanities initiatives. The emails include direct correspondence with top Harvard officials, such as Faust and University Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers '74.
Although many of the emails detail general Overseers business, such as regular meeting schedules and updates on University events and policy changes, others are more personal. Notably, they acknowledge Lynton’s uniquely powerful position within the arts world and his capacity to form connections between Hollywood and Harvard. In addition to detailing his on-campus responsibilities as a member of Harvard’s second-highest governing body and a donor, the correspondence shows that Harvard has utilized Lynton’s professional connections and interests to help advance its own.
According to one December 2013 message from Associate Vice President for Principal Gifts and Alumni Affairs and Development Roger P. Cheever ’67, “you are rapidly becoming an indispensible [sic] leader on the West Coast.”
OVERSEER BUSINESS
The Board of Overseers, the governing body that among other privileges is tasked with approving the appointment of the University president, meets monthly. Its members include chief executive officers of major corporations, journalists, and judges, among others, many of whom are widely known within their professions and the wider world.
The Board tours campus, participates in discussions about Harvard issues and policies, and according to the emails, sometimes drinks cocktails at Elmwood, Faust’s official residence. When the Board—which is composed of 30 elected alumni from across the University—is not convened, Harvard informs its members of major University business and instructs them how to handle the press.
According to a meeting itinerary detailed in one 2013 message from University Vice President and Board of Overseers Secretary Secretary Marc L. Goodheart ’81, the Overseers had a list of activities scheduled for Dec. 7 and 8, 2013. The group’s weekend visit to Cambridge included a tour of the newly-renovated portion of Quincy House and hours of meetings in Loeb House. Members also attended cocktails, a dinner party, and a lunch session.
But beyond these regular visits, Harvard stays in contact with the Overseers through official email messages informing them of major changes and upcoming announcements. Harvard’s communication with its Overseers often involves University updates, including policy changes and new administrative appointments.
Links to numerous articles in the Harvard Gazette, a publication produced by Harvard communications officials, populated Lynton’s inbox in 2014. When Harvard administrators such as former School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Cherry A. Murray and former University public affairs and communications vice president Christine M. Heenan stepped down, Lynton received emails addressed to the Overseers highlighting the news.
When the University unveiled new policy changes, administrators often sent Lynton and other Overseers emails linking to Harvard public relations materials with instructions on how to respond to press inquiries.
Last July, for instance, when Harvard unveiled its first University-wide sexual harassment policy, Goodheart sent to Overseers a link to a Gazette article on the topic. He advised them to reach out to University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83—who was copied on the message—if they had any questions and suggested that they could direct media inquires to Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, the University’s public relations and lobbying arm.
Harvard has also informed Lynton of other University changes that have drawn controversy in the last year. Last semester, Harvard came under fire from faculty after it instituted unpopular changes to its health benefits plan for non-union employees. In November, Goodheart sent Overseers a link to an Inside Higher Ed article addressing the issue, as well as an article from the Gazette and the text of a letter that Faust sent to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in response to the controversy.
In the email, sent with the subject line “FYI re health benefits,” Goodheart suggested that the Overseers look to The Crimson and Harvard Magazine for further coverage. Goodheart also requested that they “please” refer media inquiries on the topic to University spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Later in the month, shortly after the University came under scrutiny from a lawsuit charging that the College’s race-based affirmative action policies were discriminatory, Iuliano sent a message to the Overseers with a breakdown of the allegations and the University’s planned action.
“Today’s lawsuit represents a direct challenge to a core educational principle,” Iuliano wrote in the message, which was marked privileged and confidential and was forwarded to the group by Goodheart. “We will vigorously defend the right of Harvard, and other universities, to continue to seek the educational benefits that come from a class that is diverse on multiple dimensions.”
Writing that “[w]e anticipate that the court filing will generate substantial attention,” Iuliano advised Overseers that they could direct media inquires to HPAC’s Paul Andrew, who is now Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications. Iuliano added that the Overseers should “remember that communications about this matter other than with counsel are not privileged and may be discoverable in the litigation. For that reason, I would ask for your forbearance.”
The lawsuit has not yet been resolved.
BUILDING CONNECTIONS
Beyond the general messages he receives detailing Overseers business and campus happenings, however, Lynton works with Harvard officials on a more personal level to advance the University’s interests, according to the emails. As CEO of Sony Entertainment, Lynton communicates with high-profile Hollywood figures on a regular basis, and in some instances he has helped establish connections between these figures and the University. He has also connected Harvard development officials with potential donors from L.A. and the arts world, suggesting that Lynton as an Overseer serves a key connecting role separate from his time in Cambridge.
Notably, Lynton corresponds regularly with Rogers, Harvard’s alumni affairs and development head who oversees much of the University’s fundraising, and has worked with her to organize at least one alumni event. In March 2014, Lynton hosted a dinner party for Faust in his Los Angeles home, according to one exchange.
In an email, Rogers made suggestions for a guest list, and their exchange suggests that officials considered prospective guests’ donation records when deciding whom to invite.
Rogers first suggested that Lynton invite one prospective guest, for example, apparently because he was considering donating. A “very senior L.A. fundraiser” recommended that the individual “be invited as he is considering a large solicitation,” Rogers wrote to Lynton in an email, “but of course that is up to you as host.”
Rogers also indicated that Faust had requested that actors Matt Damon ’92 and John Lithgow ’67 attend.
Writing that she had “looked at [Lynton’s] comments, alumni “capacity” (based on our research), and their giving,” Rogers suggested adding several others to the guest list. She wrote in an email that one prospective guest “has been a decent donor ” and “very much would like to meet Drew”; another, she wrote, “has great capacity.” She described another possible guest as having “been quite generous in the past; could be good to re-engage.”
Harvard officials have also turned to Lynton for help bringing Hollywood figures to campus for speaking events. Last year, he helped coordinate a public discussion between Faust and popular television show “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan, which Faust lauded in a personal email exchange with Lynton. Lynton has emailed Faust individually about a variety of topics.
Upon request in January 2014 by then-Harvard Alumni Association executive director John P. “Jack” Reardon ’60, Lynton also extended an invitation on behalf of Harvard for actress Natalie Portman ’03 to speak at the College’s 2014 Class Day. Portman was unable to attend last year, but film producer Aleen Keshishian suggested confirming Portman as 2015’s speaker.
Portman will speak at this year’s College Class Day on May 27, as formally announced last week.
Rogers also emailed Lynton requesting that he verify Damon’s email address when a person who identified himself as Damon wrote to Faust with a recommendation for a student applying to the College’s Class of 2018.
A FRIEND OF THE ARTS
Beyond helping coordinate Harvard and Hollywood figures, Lynton has been an active supporter of the arts at Harvard, and humanities faculty and administrators in Cambridge have turned to him with news about their initiatives.
Emails between photography collector Michael Mattis ’82 and Lynton in 2013 indicate that the Overseer planned to donate about $550,000 of photographs to the Fogg Museum. He also donates annually to the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, according to University professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr.
Lynton is a member of the Committee on University Resources, a group for top donors, according to an email he received that was addressed to the group.
Lynton’s commitment to the humanities at Harvard has built him relationships with administrators and faculty in Cambridge. In 2014, Lynton exchanged emails with Harvard Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen.
Additionally, before Harvard unveiled plans for its new undergraduate concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media last October, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent Lynton an advance copy of the announcement that administrators planned to release later that day. In his email, Smith specifically noted the amount of endowment support the concentration would require to be sustainable in the long term: $20 million.
“As someone who has been especially supportive of these efforts, I wanted you to be among the first to know,” Smith wrote.
Lynton, in turn, is also familiar with administrators at the College’s admissions office. According to the published emails, he works as an alumni interviewer, and beyond those efforts, Lynton has assisted individual Harvard applicants on their resumes and application materials.
Last fall, Lynton drafted an email to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67  offering his “highest recommendation” for one particular applicant.
A ‘LIST’ OF REQUESTS
Together, the emails suggest that Lynton devotes significant time and energy to helping Harvard, both financially and otherwise. But while Lynton’s messages to Harvard officials convey an eagerness to contribute his time and resources to University initiatives, one message expressed a concern that Harvard may be asking too much.
In an email last July to prominent Harvard donor and Hasty Pudding chairman and “Grand Sphinx” Andrew L. Farkas '82, Lynton detailed a number of requests he had received from Harvard. He listed hosting large events and dinners for Faust so that she could “meet the creative community here” and “[e]ndlessly taking calls from professors who need help with issues in Hollywood,” among other points.
“[T]he list goes on and on and on,” Lynton wrote. “And then all the time for the Overseers. I think they really have to be careful about what they ask of me and what kind of money they are asking.”
He added in his email that he was considering taking a break from Harvard activities, beyond monthly Overseers meetings, and “see if I am up for a big gift in a year's time.”
It is clear that Harvard highly values Lynton’s work. University spokesperson Jeff Neal, for his part, wrote in a statement that Lynton is “deeply involved in various aspects of University life, particularly as a member of the Board of Overseers, an alumni interviewer and an important source of advice and support on the arts.”
“While it is truly unfortunate that his personal emails were stolen, his correspondence with Harvard administrators and faculty only serves to demonstrate the depth of his ongoing commitment to Harvard,” Neal added.
Last May, when Lynton was reelected to the Board of Overseers, Goodheart sent him an email with a personal congratulatory note.
“We’re of course not allowed to root for candidates here – but rest assured that a huge (inaudible) cheer is resounding through Loeb House and Mass Hall,” Goodheart wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking out about the recent decision by Wikileaks to publish a searchable database of thousands of hacked emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment, CEO Michael M. Lynton ’82 called the dissemination “frustrating” and expressed disappointment in the website archiving his emails.
Hundreds of emails to and from Lynton’s email account, including correspondence with other Harvard Overseers and officials such as University President Drew G. Faust and University Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers '74, are now archived on WikiLeaks. Among other points, they detail his participation in Harvard alumni and fundraising activities. Lynton is a graduate of the College and the Business School and is a major University donor.
“These are emails that are stolen,” Lynton said in an interview with The Crimson on Thursday. “These are often times private correspondence. I am not concerned about the things that I’ve said, but often times people have written to me with private matters that I’m sure they wouldn't want to see in the public eye.”
In November, Sony was the subject of a cyber security attack that led to the leaks. In December, U.S. intelligence officials linked the Sony attack to North Korea, which was the subject of a controversial comedy film, “The Interview,” which Sony eventually released.
On Thursday, Lynton said he had been in contact with Harvard Vice President and Board of Overseers Secretary Marc L. Goodheart '81 about the emails. Lynton does not think Harvard is very concerned about them, he said.
“I’ve devoted a lot of time to try to be helpful to the University, whether that be at the Overseer level, or trying to be helpful to make sure the arts and humanities are helped out at the University,” Lynton said. “There’s nothing I think that I've had in my correspondence with either Tamara or Drew that’s untoward.”
Lynton has repeatedly donated to Harvard, particularly to arts and humanities initiatives, and hosted fundraising and alumni events on the West Coast.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that Lynton’s emails show that he is a “strongly supportive member of the Harvard community.”
“While it is truly unfortunate that his personal emails were stolen, his correspondence with Harvard administrators and faculty only serves to demonstrate the depth of his ongoing commitment to Harvard,” Neal wrote.
Sony issued a statement condemning WikiLeaks’ publishing of the hacked emails earlier in the month.
“The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm [Sony] and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort,” a Sony spokesperson said in a statement. “We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks’ assertion that this material belongs in the public domain and will continue to fight for the safety, security, and privacy of our company and its more than 6,000 employees.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­This Saturday, the Harvard men’s volleyball team sailed into a home match against Sacred Heart (12-13, 3-9 EIVA) with the hope of anchoring a second-place playoff seed with a victory.
Although the Crimson (13-11, 7-5 EIVA) reached its destination with a 3-2 win, the team had to overcome some choppy water. Despite holding 1-0 and 2-1 game leads, Harvard needed a fifth set to beat the Pioneers and secure a first-round matchup with George Mason on Wednesday.
“We weren’t at our best,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “We were a little flat. But the guys stepped up, and we got the points when we needed to.”
Midway through the fourth game at the Malkin Athletic Center, the wind seemed to have shifted in the home team’s direction when Harvard used a 6-0 run to erase an early 5-1 margin.
Then Sacred Heart responded with a tack of its own, putting together a 5-1 stretch to regain control soon after. The two sides traded points until the Pioneers finished the frame with a three-point run that pushed the score to 25-20.
“There were small execution things that were leading to big runs for them,” junior outside hitter Branden Clemens said. “We decided to clean up our game and focus on what we do best.
Sacred Heart outside hitter Enzo Mackenzie played a large role in this game, as he did throughout the night. The senior tallied six kills in the fourth frame and ended with 22 overall.
In the fifth set, Mackenzie’s four finishes accounted for half of the Pioneers’ offense. However, the Crimson opened the game on a 5-1 run and never let Sacred Heart get closer than two en route to a 15-8 win.
Outside hitter D.J. White notched the final kill of the match, which marked a fitting ending to a night on which Harvard celebrated its two seniors and co-captains, Caleb Zimmick and White. While White racked up 15 kills, Zimmick watched from the bench in sweatpants, confined there by sickness.
“This game was to honor the seniors,” Clemens said. “They’ve been role models for me. They’ve set such a precedent, volleyball-wise, that I’ve been trying to strive for my entire career.”
In the first set, the Crimson’s play seemed to reflect such appreciation, as Harvard jumped to a 10-5 advantage on the strength of six kills. The Crimson led the rest of the way and took the game, 25-20.
The trio of White, sophomore brother Casey White, and Clemens directed the attack with a combined 14 finishes in the frame. On the night, each player recorded at least 15 kills, and Clemens topped his side with 18.
“We’ve finally gotten a groove at least as far as energy is concerned,” Clemens said. “When we have better energy, we play looser and play the game that we know we can.”
Harvard experienced even smoother sailing for much of the third set, building a 9-2 advantage off serving runs from freshman setter Marko Kostich and freshman middle blocker Brad Gretsch.
But point by point, the Pioneers clawed back. The Crimson needed a late-frame timeout and a final finish from freshman middle blocker Riley Moore to secure the 25-22 set victory.
The idea of escape typified the contest, as the Crimson was fighting for the right to avoid a first round matchup with Penn State, winners of 31 EIVA championships. Thanks to Saturday’s win, Harvard booked a date with the Patriots instead.
Yet the Crimson didn’t look much like a playoff competitor in the second frame, as Sacred Heart held the hosts to a .115 hitting percentage. The Pioneers led wire-to-wire thanks to four runs of at least three points.
Then, as occurred throughout the night, Harvard mustered the energy to take the next game. “We played our best matches in the second half of the season,” Baise said. “I think we’re ready. I think we’re playing as well as we’ve played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team was unable to pick up its first Ivy League win of the season in its final opportunity Saturday against Dartmouth. The Crimson fell to the Big Green, 5-2, on Senior Day at the Beren Tennis Center in what was captain Sylvia Li’s final match. This was the first season during coach Traci Green’s eight-year tenure in Cambridge that Harvard has gone winless in conference play.
“I was proud of our fight and heart,” Green said. “Throughout the whole season, we’ve been battling a lot of adversity and unexpected injuries to our top players. We’ve never stopped fighting, never got negative. We pulled together, and that really showed against Dartmouth. We might have had a losing record, but we had a winning attitude, and that’s what’s important.”
Dartmouth (18-5, 5-2 Ivy) jumped out to an early lead after winning the day’s first two doubles matches. The Crimson (7-12, 0-7) used the same doubles lineup that split the doubles points with Brown and Yale last weekend, but did not receive the same success on Saturday.
In a matchup of two underclassman duos, sophomore Monica Lin and freshman Annika Ringblom of Harvard fell to sophomore Taylor Ng and freshman Kristina Mathis, 8-3. In the second doubles match, the Big Green’s duo of co-captain Akiko Okuda and junior Katherine Yau bested junior Amy He and freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten, 8-4. The loss snaped He and Jang-Milsten’s two-match win streak.
The Crimson roared back once singles play began. After Ringblom took her first set against Yau, the Dartmouth junior defaulted in the second set to give Harvard the match and tie the overall score at one. He kept the momentum going from the sixth singles spot, claiming victory over Okuda with a 7-5, 6-3 victory to give the Crimson a 2-1 edge. The singles victory was He’s second in a row. The wins for Ringblom and He allowed both of them to finish their spring campaigns with .500 records (11-11).
“Our team was resilient each and every week,” Green said. “We set out to achieve our goals, and if they didn’t happen, we brushed the dirt off and got right back on the saddle. All those life lessons will definitely bode well for the future. We have a very young team.”
Harvard was unable to pick up a win in the day’s final four matches as the Big Green picked up victories in the first, third, fourth, and fifth singles slots. The Crimson was once again without freshman and first singles player Nikki Kallenberg, who re-aggravated an injury last weekend. In the day’s top singles match, Ng ousted sophomore Monica Lin in a hard-fought 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 contest. In the day’s closest match, Jang-Milsten fell to sophomore Jacqueline Crawford.
Mathis ousted sophomore June Lee, 7-6, 6-2. Lee struggled to find a rhythm in Ivy League play after battling injuries for the majority of the season. After picking up a key victory in last weekend’s match against Brown, junior Amanda Lin fell to Dartmouth freshman Julia Schroeder, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6.
“Overall, it was a pretty close match,” Lee said. “It could have gone either way. This season didn’t go how we wanted it to, but at the same time, each match was better than the last. I think a season like this shows us how anything can happen in the Ivies, and we’re just going to have to work on execution and staying positive throughout the whole match.”
Harvard went 42-33 in Li’s four years with the team, 12-16 in Ivy League play. The Cupertino, Calif., native finished her senior campaign with a 12-9 individual record, also reaching the regional quarterfinals in doubles play in the fall.
“Sylvia is a very warm, generous, kind person,” Green said. “We’re going to miss her a lot, on and off the court. On the court, she’s got a huge serve, a huge forehand. We’re definitely going to miss those aspects of her game that help us and propel the team along.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the end of the regular season approaching, the Harvard men’s crew teams were on the road this weekend, with the heavyweight team racing against Navy and Penn, and the lightweight team taking on Ivy League rivals Princeton and Yale. Overall, the heavyweight team brought home two trophies, while the lightweights fell to their opponents.
The No. 5 heavyweight team captured the Adams Cup for the 17th straight year in its penultimate regular season race with wins over No. 11 Navy and No. 8 Penn in Annapolis, Md. The Crimson dominated, sweeping all five events.
The varsity eight boat, led by senior coxswain Jessi Izhakoff and junior stroke James Croxford, had a narrow win, finishing with a time of 6:02.24, just three feet and 0.61 seconds ahead of the Midshipmen. Penn finished just under 10 seconds behind with a time of 6:11.94.
“I was expecting a tough race,” senior rower Charles Risbey said. “Overall the team performed well. It's always extremely exciting for all of our boats to win, especially when we are racing against two deep and experienced teams.”
The second eight also had a close win, besting the Quakers by just over a second. Harvard finished at 6:07.53, Penn at 6:08.89, and Navy at 6:11.59. The third and fourth varsity teams recorded close wins as well. The 3V boat finished two seconds ahead of the Navy boat, and the 4V boat finished just a little over a second ahead of the Mids.
The freshman boat had the only open water win, finishing eight seconds ahead of Penn, the nearest boat. The boat crossed the finish line at 6:08.09, with Penn at 6:16.24, and Navy at 6:16.84.
The heavyweight team was also awarded another prize: the Clothier Trophy, which is given to the team with the most points after each of the five races.
“It is clear that there are are many very fast and capable crews in the league this year,” Risbey said. “My take away is that if we are going to be as successful as previous years, we will need to continue improving to make sure that we close the gap to Princeton and the other top crews.”
A few hundred miles away, the No. 4 lightweight team wrapped up its regular season on the Housatonic River in Derby, Conn. It dropped races against Ancient Eight rivals No. 3 Princeton and No. 6 Yale.
The second varsity boat, coxed by senior Alexander Spencer and stroked by senior Connor Mangan, had the only victory of the day. The team finished in 5:40.91 and won by three seconds over the Bulldogs, who finished at 5:43.79.
The V8 team also had a close race but was off the mark by the same margin by which the JV team won. Princeton took home the Goldthwait Cup, awarded to the winner, finishing in 5:36.26. Yale was two seconds behind, and Harvard came in at 5:39.96.
“My boat went out there today and left it all on the course,” freshman lightweight Liam Daily said. “We followed our plan and started off hard, then kept pushing the gas down all the way through the finish. I'm proud of every single guy in the boat, and it's a privilege to get to row with them.”
The third and fourth varsity boats both came in second place. The 3V team was behind Princeton by one second, and ahead of Yale by two. The 4V boat lost to the Tigers by five seconds.
“Going forward, we know that we can make the boat fly,” Daily said.  “I thought the races today were the most exciting races so far this season, and now we have confidence that we can row with some of the fastest crews out there. Confidence is huge, and now we have one more reason to get out on the water and get faster every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­With its CWPA Eastern Championship hopes on the line, the Harvard women’s water polo team was unable to erase a two-goal halftime deficit against No. 20 Hartwick on Friday in Princeton, N.J.
Although the team would rebound in the consolation bracket on Saturday, the Crimson (20-13, 6-3 CWPA) came two goals shy of closing out the season with a win on Sunday, falling to Brown in the fifth-place game to take sixth overall in the tournament.
“Our team has definitely made some huge strides this year,” sophomore Michelle Martinelli said. “We definitely saw some glimmers of that this weekend, but I don’t think the outcome of the weekend reflects how much effort and hard work we put into this season.”
BROWN 8, HARVARD 7
The Crimson entered the final frame of its final contest of the year tied. Despite a late goal from junior Yoshi Andersen, the Bears (20-17, 4-5 CWPA) prevailed after adding two in the frame, handing the Crimson a loss to end its season with a sixth-place finish.
“This game, we got unlucky on a few calls and a few shots, and they hit their shots,” Martinelli said. “We played our game, and they played their game; they just got luckier than we did.”
Freshman goalkeeper Marisol Dakan shut the door on the Harvard offense, recording 10 saves in the game to lead her team to victory. The rookie provided four crucial saves in the last eight minutes to preserve the one-goal lead for Brown.
Harvard rode Andersen and Martinelli on offense for the duration of the game, as the two were the only ones to register goals for the Crimson.
HARVARD 14, BUCKNELL 7
On Saturday, Martinelli opened her scoring early in the game with two tallies in the first quarter. She wouldn’t slow down.
The second-year star found the back of the net a season-high five times, leading the team to a rebound win over Bucknell (14-14, 3-6 CWPA) on the second day of Easterns.
“It’s been a really tough season for me because I’ve been dealing with some injuries,” Martinelli said. “I’ve finally been getting on the right track this past month and a half.... I take every game as an opportunity to give it my all because I really appreciate it now.”
The Crimson opened the game with three goals in the first eight minutes of the contest. Harvard would not concede the lead for the rest of the game, due in large part to Andersen’s three second quarter goals, which proved to be the margin going into halftime.
The third-year would add another goal in the second half to finish with four on the game. Martinelli and Andersen combined to outscore the Bison, 9-7.
HARTWICK 12, HARVARD 10
Down 11-8 entering the fourth quarter, Martinelli found the back of the net to cut No. 20 Hartwick’s (20-19, 6-4 CWPA) lead to two. But the Hawks’ tally with six minutes left in the frame proved to be the backbreaker for Harvard’s comeback efforts. Senior Kalina Grabb earned Harvard’s last goal to bring the score to 12-10, but it was too little, too late as the Crimson would fall by that very score minutes later.
The Crimson came out of the gates firing on all cylinders, opening the game on a 3-1 run. But after Hartwick scored three straight, Harvard would not hold the lead again for the rest of the contest.Harvard kept it close in the beginning of the second half, as sophomore Melissa Balding netted one of her four goals to help tie the game at five goals apiece. But Hartwick did not let the Crimson hang around for too long, as the Hawks countered with a three-goal run of their own, holding the outright lead for the remainder of the game.
Despite the loss, Harvard ensured that it would achieve its first 20-win season since 2004 with its win over Bucknell.
“We’re just scratching the surface of what Harvard water polo can be able to accomplish,” Andersen said. “The loss is heavy on our minds now, but looking back on everything, we improved so much as a whole team. We’re confident we’ll be able to improve in the years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­With a trip to the Ivy League Championship Series at stake on the season’s final weekend, the Harvard softball team matched up against Dartmouth for a home-and-home series.
The Big Green (23-16, 16-4 Ivy) entered the weekend three games ahead of the Crimson (23-21, 13-7) in the standings, so Harvard needed to sweep the four-game series to come away with the Ivy North title. But by dropping its first game on Friday afternoon, the team’s fate was sealed for the remainder of the weekend.
Saturday’s last game proved to be a tearful goodbye for the Crimson as the team graduates seven seniors, many of whom have had a profound influence on the team in their four years.
“I guess to sum it up, they’ve been a special class,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “They’ve been great friends, they’ve been great teammates to each other, they’ve been great leaders on this team, and I think they’re some of the best people I was lucky to be around.”
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 1
Although the fate of its season had already been decided, the Crimson fought until the end of its final matchup against the Big Green at Soldiers Field.
Harvard struck first in the fourth inning, but Dartmouth answered in their next at bats by scoring three runs. The Big Green tacked on another in the top of the seventh to widen the gap, and the Crimson was unable to respond.
Senior Gabrielle Ruiz got the start in the circle for Harvard, and classmate Laura Ricciardone came on in the fifth to close out the game.
“This weekend as a whole we were able to come out really strong,” senior outfielder Andrea Del Conte said. “We obviously wanted to come out and compete for a championship, but we gave it our all the whole way through.”
HARVARD 3, DARTMOUTH 2
In a game that came down to the wire, it was senior infielder Adrienne Hume that delivered the final victory of the season for the Crimson.
With the score tied at two in the bottom of the seventh, Hume stepped up to the plate with runners at first and second and ripped a single down the left field line, bringing in the winning run.
For the majority of the game, the teams were tied. The game remainedscoreless until the fifth inning when Dartmouth outfielder Tiffany Dyson hit a two-run home run.
Harvard answered immediately in the bottom of the inning by stringing together two runs after a double by sophomore infielder Catherine Callaway scored senior catcher Katherine Appelbe and junior outfielder Haley Davis.
It was not until the bottom of the seventh that the Crimson scored again, securing the win.
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 6
Propelled by a six-run offensive outburst in the seventh inning, the Crimson rallied late in the game to record its first win of the weekend in Hanover.
The inning commenced with a hit batter and a single from senior infielder Katie Lantz, setting up Del Conte with a chance for an RBI. Del Conte delivered, poking a single through the infield to cut the deficit to 5-2.
Two batters later, Davis lifted a pitch over the fence with two runners on, pulling the Crimson even. Back-to-back hits from senior infielder Adrienne Hume and Appelbe later in the inning brought in two more runs, giving Harvard the lead.
Dartmouth came back with a run of its own in the bottom of the seventh, but Ricciardone got senior Kristen Rumley to fly out to center field to end the game.
“They’ve been an incredible team,” Allard said. “A lot of this team’s success has had to do with being resilient and being tough, and that showed in the games we were able to take this weekend.”
DARTMOUTH 1, HARVARD 0
After the Big Green scored in its first at bats of the series, the scoreboard went silent for the remainder of the contest.
In the bottom of the first, Dartmouth manufactured its lone run after leadoff hitter Katie McEachern was hit by a pitch and stole second. With two outs, outfielder Karen Chaw singled off of Ricciardone, bringing McEachern around to score.
The Crimson offense was able to muster only four hits throughout the game, with two coming off the bat of senior shortstop Emily Gusse.
Riccardone suffered the loss, pitching all six innings while striking out four and walking none.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dartmouth capped off its eighth consecutive Red Rolfe Division championship-winning season with a four-game sweep of Harvard this weekend, picking up two wins in Hanover on Saturday and two more in Cambridge on Sunday.
The Big Green (20-19, 16-4 Ivy), who finished the regular season on a 14-game winning streak and went undefeated in division play, will take on either Columbia or Penn in next weekend’s Ivy League Championship. Despite finishing below .500, the 2015 campaign was the best in coach Bill Decker’s three seasons at the helm of the Crimson (18-24, 7-13).
“I think this group is a special group for me because it’s [my] first group,” Decker said. “These guys were in the program for three years. I really enjoyed coaching them, working with them, being with them. They’ve set a path for the guys next year to follow.”
DARTMOUTH 7, HARVARD 2
In the final game of the series at O’Donnell Field, the Big Green roughed up Harvard starter Ian Miller, who had dominated his last two outings against Yale and Northeastern, for five runs (three earned) in four and a third innings. Senior pitcher Chris England threw six solid innings for Dartmouth, while classmate infielder Jay Graham led the way for the Big Green with three hits and three RBIs.
Junior Nick Scahill threw three and two-thirds scoreless innings out of the bullpen for the Crimson, while captain Ethan Ferreira and freshman Connor Quinn combined for five of the team’s nine hits.
DARTMOUTH 6, HARVARD 4 (8 INNINGS)
Harvard dropped to 0-4 in extra-inning games after freshman infielder Dustin Shirley’s two-run single in the eighth gave Dartmouth the lead for good. The Crimson tied the game up at four in the bottom of the seventh after senior center fielder Mike Martin singled home fellow fourth-year Jack Colton, but Harvard was unable to get any runs across to extend the game in the eighth.
Senior Tanner Anderson, making his final collegiate start, surrendered three earned runs in six innings of work. Sophomore Nick Gruener made his second consecutive appearance out of the bullpen but was tagged with the loss after surrendering both runs in the Big Green eighth.
In their final weekend of action, seniors Jake McGuiggan, Ferreira, Martin, and Colton combined for eight of the Crimson’s nine hits.
“This class was definitely very talented,” McGuiggan said. “Talent-wise, it was a good class. Personality-wise, it was a good class. I’m confident the younger guys will be able to fill those roles and make for a productive season next year.”
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard plated three runs against Dartmouth ace Duncan Robinson at Biondi Park, but it was not enough as a four-run seventh inning propelled the Big Green to a win. After six spotless innings, senior Matt Timoney surrendered three hits and a walk in the bottom of the seventh before being replaced by junior T.J. Laurisch.
Dartmouth batted around in the inning, one which saw senior infielder Matt Parisi come up with the game-winning single. Sophomore Chris Burkholder picked up a hold, and freshman Patrick Peterson earned the save after stymying the Crimson in the eighth and ninth, respectively. Ferreira hit his fifth home run of the season for Harvard, while McGuiggan and Quinn each drove in a run.
DARTMOUTH 8, HARVARD 1
The Crimson offense struggled to produce clutch hits in Saturday’s opener. After Harvard tied the game at one in the second inning, the Big Green finished the game with seven unanswered runs. For the game, the Crimson left 11 runners on base.
Sophomore Mike Concato was strong on the mound for Dartmouth, allowing just the one run and seven hits in six innings. Dartmouth roughed up junior Sean Poppen for eight earned runs in four and two-thirds innings. Rookie right fielder Kyle Holbrook had three hits on the day, including a three-run home run to pace the Big Green.
Shortstop Drew Reid was the only Harvard player to record multiple hits. The sophomore had three singles in the game.
“We would have liked to have finished with a couple wins this weekend,” McGuiggan said. “It’s tough to finish the career with a losing streak. At the same time, I think this whole team really improved a lot this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the fourth consecutive season, the Harvard women’s golf team took the Ivy League Championship, edging Yale by just one stroke over the three-day tournament to come out on top Sunday at Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Pa.
Sophomore Anne Cheng and junior Courtney Hooton led the way for the Crimson, finishing three strokes behind first-place finisher Christine Kim of Brown to tie for fourth on the individual leaderboard. Harvard finished each of its five competitors in the top 20, and the team stayed on top with all-around solid play from top to bottom.
It was a race to the finish for the Crimson and the Bulldogs. After beginning the day eight strokes ahead of Yale and tied with Columbia, Harvard watched its lead dwindle. But the Crimson held on, even as Harvard golfers could only guess the exact score.
“We don’t really pay attention to the score and don’t know where we are at any point in time, so I didn’t really know how close it was,” junior Courtney Hooton said. “I think that in hindsight...every stroke counts. Even if you think you might be out of it or way ahead of it, you have to treat every shot as important as the next and the one before it. It was a learning experience that it came that close.”
Day one was rough for the Crimson, as Cheng shot a nine-over 81 and Hooton a seven-over 79. As a team, Harvard found itself in the bottom half of the seven-team field, nine strokes off the Lions’ pace.
“I didn’t do too well on the first day; it was really windy and the greens were very slippery,” Cheng said. “But then I got the hang of it on the second and third day.”
The Crimson bounced back in round two with the only team score under 300 for the day. All of a sudden, Harvard was back in contention.
“I think between the first and second round there were a couple of different things,” Hooton said. “The first day it was way colder, and also it was very windy, so we were just trying to make sure that we were focusing on trying to do the best we could with the factors that we could control.”
Cheng attributed the change in fortunes at least in part to having gained some more knowledge of course conditions after the first 18 holes of golf.
“I think generally the hardest part was..the greens because the practice area was very different from the actual greens,” Cheng said. “So we focused on our putting on the course to get a feel for the greens because we couldn’t [do so] at any other time…. We also made sure to think about our process and take one shot at a time.”
After a second round 72, Hooton was at the top of the leaderboard, but a third round score of 79 dropped her three spots on day three.
“Of course it’s disappointing—I definitely think I balance that with our team win, which was so exciting, especially for the seniors, and also for the team to break the record of three [championships] in a row,” Hooton said. “It’s a pretty incredible feat.”
Looking ahead to the following Ivy season, the Crimson returns three of the five members of the team that made the trip to the three-day championship tournament.
In Cheng, who won the 2014 Ivy League individual title, Harvard has a leader who should anchor the Crimson’s main five rotation throughout the upcoming two seasons.
“I’ll just keep doing the things I’ve been [doing] and try to stay consistent,” Cheng said.
With the title, Harvard earned an automatic bid to compete at one of four NCAA regional tournaments, which will be held May 7-9. The Crimson will learn its seed on Monday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s final game of the season against rival Yale on Saturday, the Crimson stormed out to a second-quarter lead and withstood a late comeback attempt from the Bulldogs (9-4, 3-3 Ivy) to finish off its season on a high note and without a losing record.
“This was the first game a lot of guys on our team had played where win or lose, the season was over," said co-captain and goaltender Jake Gambitsky, as Harvard failed to earn a bid to postseason competition. “But we still had a great week of practice, had a lot of fun, and nothing really change[d] despite the playoff situation.”
On Senior Day at Soldiers Field, the Crimson (7-7, 2-4) was led by a powerful effort from Gambitsky, making his first start since early March and playing in his final collegiate game. The senior captain was dominant in net for Harvard, making 13 saves and finishing with a stifling 65 percent save percentage, the second highest of his career. He allowed just one goal in the first half, securing seven saves.
“It was an emotional day as it’s our last game,” Gambitsky said. “I was happy that we were able to get out to an early lead and deflate them, stopping them from getting any momentum at the start."
Another Harvard senior, long stick midfielder Brian Fischer, also had a strong performance in his final game.
“I’m really happy for our four seniors,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Fischer had an excellent game, defending Yale’s best midfielders and picking up key ground balls to ignite transitions. And Gambitsky had a huge game for us too. He was outstanding all game, and it was an incredible effort.”
Neither team could score in the early stretches of the game until the Crimson jumped out to the first lead with a goal from freshman defenseman Joe Kearney with fewer than five minutes remaining in the first quarter, the only goal of the period.
The second quarter proved to be a productive one for Harvard. It started quickly as junior midfielder and co-captain Sean Mahon scored just eight seconds after the restart. This was followed 45 seconds later by a goal from high-scoring freshman midfielder Joe Lang to put Harvard up 3-0.
The Bulldogs responded with a goal, but the Crimson pushed back harder, with back-to-back goals from two freshmen, attackman J.T. Palladino and midfielder Morgan Cheek, to finish the half up, 5-1.
But Yale would not go away quietly.
The Bulldogs bounced back in the third quarter, dwarfing a goal from another Harvard freshman, attackman Tim Edmonds, with three of its own to bring the game back into close contention going into the final 15 minutes of the Crimson’s season.
Cheek scored first in the fourth quarter, stretching the Harvard lead back up to three goals at 7-4, before Yale answered with two straight tallies to bring its deficit back to just one.
But the effort proved too little, too late for the Bulldogs. Junior attackman Will Walker extended the lead back to two goals with eight minutes left, and then the Harvard defense stiffened, refusing to allow another goal until Yale scored with only 13 seconds remaining, which was not enough to stop Harvard from winning.
Freshmen scored six of the Crimson’s eight goals, while seniors led the defensive effort, and Harvard’s typically prominent junior class stayed quiet.
“Overall, we’ve been fairly young on the offensive end all year,” Wojcik said. “And yesterday, you could see some of the freshmen stepping up and really becoming sophomores out there.”
Harvard, which finished first in the powerhouse Ivy League last year, will not make the conference tournament this season. Instead, the team will have to direct its postseason hopes towards next season, as it loses only four seniors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard sailing team took to rivers and oceans alike, competing in four regattas. The women’s team took 12th at the NEISA Conference Championship, while co-ed contingents took fourth, sixth, and eighth in the Admiral’s Cup, the Boston Dinghy Cup and the George Morris Trophy, respectively.
NEISA CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP/REED TROPHY
An all-female contingent of the Crimson traveled to Boston College, where sailors competed against other NEISA teams for a shot at nationals. Harvard’s 12th place finish fell short as the top eight teams received a bid.
The trophy ended up in the hands of host Boston College, who was followed by the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and Yale.
While the weather was clear and sunny, shifty winds provided a challenge for sailors. On a few occasions, the tricky winds resulted in disqualifications.
In the A division, freshman skipper Taylor Ladd raced the first 10 races alongside junior crew Kristina Jakobson. For races 11-16, senior crew Rebecca Frankel stepped in. The Crimson earned 12th place in the division, one point ahead of 13th place Roger Williams.
Racing in the B division, the duo of junior skipper Sophie Bermudez and senior crew Ashleigh Inglis sailed to a 12th place finish with 145 points.
BOSTON DINGHY CUP
Another Harvard squad took sixth at the 80th Boston Dinghy Cup—the oldest race in college sailing. The Crimson’s combined score of 183 put it ahead of No. 2 BC and No. 1 Yale. The sailors traveled just down the river to MIT, where they competed in three divisions.
“It's cool to think that 80 years later, we're still sailing the same courses in the same part of the Charles River basin,” freshman skipper Nick Sertl said.
Repeat champion Stanford took first place with a score of 163, coming back from some low-placing performances at the beginning of the regatta.
Eighteen teams trekked to the interconference competition, including Ancient Eight foes Dartmouth and Brown, which took second and fourth, respectively. Local rival Tufts took third, and host MIT took seventh. Harvard also faced new competition from all over the United States, including Washington and Buffalo.
Winds at this regatta proved shifty as well, and racing was called early on both Saturday and Sunday due to lack of wind.
“The conditions on the Charles were difficult to succeed in,” freshman Kevin Coakley said. “There was no consistency. We did our best to adjust on the fly and make smart decisions on the course.”
Senior skipper Michael Drumm and Coakley represented the Crimson in the A division. Their score of 83 edged out Vermont by a point.
The duo of senior skipper Gram Slattery and sophomore crew Julia Lord increased the team’s standing with a fourth place finish. Harvard again edged out Vermont and Dartmouth—who were tied for fifth—by a point.
This race also marked the last race on the Charles for seniors Drumm and Slattery.
“They've been major contributors to this team for the past 4 years,” Coakley said. “We will all miss them when they graduate.”
The C division provided another strong showing, as Sertl and sophomore crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj took third place.
Coakley attributes the team’s range of success to its versatility.
“We have a deep team with strong upperclassman leadership,” Coakley said. “Everyone is committed to helping the team improve and succeed.”
ADMIRAL’S CUP
While some of its members stayed local, Harvard brought a small group of sailors to New York, where they competed off King’s Point. The Crimson took home fourth place, sailing in three divisions and varying types of boats.
The regatta also used a trapezoid course with different start and finish lines, a set-up different from most of the races Harvard has competed in this year.
“A venue like King’s Point is different than the Charles for a number of reasons,” junior co-captain Sydney Karnovsky said. “On the river we have no current, but on the ocean it's something we have to constantly be aware of.  King’s Point also has much more chop than the river.”
In the A division, the team tied for fifth with Penn. Senior skipper Brian Drumm and junior crew Jacob Brandt started the weekend with low-placing finishes but made their way up to a second-place finish in one race by the end of the regatta.
The duo of skipper Andrew Mollerus and Karnovsky improved the team’s standing, taking third in the B division.
In the C division, junior Marek Zaleski sailed solo, and his performance of 58 points took sixth for the Crimson.
GEORGE MORRIS TROPHY
The Crimson yet again took to the Charles in the George Morris Trophy. The regatta, hosted by BU, was raced in two divisions in FJs, and Harvard ended the day with an eighth-place finish, beating out Roger Williams by one point.
Like in the other regattas held in Boston, the lack of wind caused some issues for sailors. Races had to be called early, with the A division completing eight races and the B division completing six.
Sophomore skipper Bennett Capozzi and freshman crew Kirstin Anderson took eighth in the A division. In the B division, freshman skipper Dylan Farrell was accompanied by Frankel, in her second regatta of the weekend.
