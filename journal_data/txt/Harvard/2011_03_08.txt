The team behind “Prometheus Bound,” the new rock musical that runs through April 2 at the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) OBERON, seems to have embraced the one quality that could have led to the downfall of the show. Advertisements for the show announce “a damned god in chains,” referring to Prometheus’s confinement throughout the production. A stagnant protagonist—Prometheus is bound by ropes and chains the entire show—should be deadly onstage; yet “Prometheus Bound” pulses with energy and rebellious spirit. Director Diane M. Paulus ’87 brings dynamism and contemporary resonance to the 2,500-year-old Greek play by Aeschylus. Her modern interpretation has its faults, but remains consistently engaging.
“Prometheus Bound” throws the audience into the myth of Prometheus (Gavin Creel) mid-story, picking up as new divine ruler Zeus is punishing the Titan for introducing fire to mankind. What follows is essentially a series of encounters between Prometheus and other figures from Greek mythology as they discuss tyrannical rule and maintaining convictions in the face of oppression.
Such plays of ideas and speechifying do not often make for compelling theatrical experiences—but add some rock music, and the vignettes come to life. Librettist and lyricist Steven Sater’s translation of Aeschylus’s script is crisp and elegant—and keeps the show moving at a rapid pace—but Sater finds his greatest poetry in the lyrics. Like in “Spring Awakening,” the recent Tony Award-winning musical for which Sater also wrote the book and lyrics, the songs represent a Brechtian break in which mood and emotion, rather than plot, are explored.
The device works well for the episodic “Prometheus.” It also allows Sater to craft many poignant sequences in the midst of profound debate. The most moving of these is the story of Io (the heartrending Uzo Aduba), a maiden seduced by Zeus and condemned to live as a cow followed by a stinging gadfly. In this production Io is interpreted as a victim of sexual abuse, and her introductory song “The Hunger” reveals her pain with piercing anguish. “He robbed your body on the way, but that’s the way we lose our fucking minds. A wall of names we leave behind, and no one knows the longing or the shame, all the ‘sorry, sorry, sorry babes,’ and so it’s over,” she sings.
Unfortunately, such striking lyrics are often lost under the pounding rhythm and volume of composer Serj Tankian’s music, which robs several moments—including Io’s tale—of both power and clarity. Sater’s translation also sacrifices depth for concision at times. He maintains the musical’s momentum but loses crucial minutiae in the process.
Emily Rebholz’s costume design further detracts from the show’s comprehensibility and confuses what is already quite an abstract story. While the combat boots, skinny jeans, and punk accessories the cast sports certainly fit the show’s anarchic vibe—and, admittedly, look pretty cool—they do nothing to clarify character. Io’s plain white linen dress is perhaps the most egregious example; the only nod to her mythological fate is a few pieces of hay stuck haphazardly in her hair. Aduba’s characterization, however, gets across the torment this abuse has wrought.
Still, much of the credit for the show’s power is owed to Creel, who portrays the eponymous prisoner of conscience with passion and defiance. Any time his performance verges on turning one-note, he starts to sing—and suddenly, his Prometheus is electric. By rearranging Creel’s bindings around OBERON periodically, Paulus also frees the Titan to keep his physical performance from growing stale, and it works; none of Zeus’ henchmen match Creel’s onstage presence.
Creel is a defiant rocker in a growing mosh pit lit stunningly by Kevin Adams. Adams has proven himself a master of creating a rock-concert atmosphere—lighting such Broadway productions as “Spring Awakening,” 2008’s “Passing Strange,” and last year’s “American Idiot” to brilliant effect—and “Prometheus” is no exception. Adams’s vivid blend of color and strobes pulsates with Tankian’s rock music and easily matches Creel in fervor.
This music seamlessly suits Prometheus’s bold and insubordinate attitude. Songs like “Total Paranoia” and “What I Think of Myself” prove rousing anthems, while the entrance of the Daughters of the Aether (Jo Lampert, Celina Carvajal, and Ashley Flanagan) with “The Earth Cries Out” is eerily beautiful. Nonetheless, there are a few missteps—namely, the folksy frame song and a number involving beatboxing and scatting.
Yet, these problems do not diminish the overall force of the show. The A.R.T. has even partnered with Amnesty International to dedicate each performance to freeing a prisoner of conscience, an inspired move that illustrates only more strongly how germane the themes of “Prometheus” are to today’s society. While the details might be muddled, the ultimate message about resistance to oppression comes through with absolute lucidity.

“Destiny has your number and she does not leave a voicemail!” explodes James B. Danner ’12 in the beginning of “Inside Out,” a new play written and directed by Christine E. Gummerson ’12. In this telling scene, a man must reevaluate his priorities in life—should he rise through the ranks of cellular advertising, or enrich his life by experiencing the wilderness? This smart, relevant play, which runs in the Loeb Drama Center’s Experimental Theater from March 10-11, confronts the strong hold that technology has over modern society and one man’s attempt to escape a world devoid of meaning.
The play follows the career crisis of Charlie (Phil M. Gillen ’13) as he is forced to deal with corporate restructuring at the phone company where he works. Facing the possibility of losing his job, he and his coworker Jillian (Valeriya Tsitron ’14) undergo an emotionally draining barrage of competency tests. After a subway encounter with the eccentric Imogen, also brilliantly portrayed by Tsitron, Charlie decides to strike out for the Alaskan wilderness to discover what he’s been missing in his life.
The standout talent of the show is Tsitron, whose ability to flip between the anxious perfectionist Jillian and the outrageously unconventional Imogen is mesmerizing. In a play that begs comparison to “Into the Wild” (dir. Sean Penn), Tsitron’s quirky turn as Imogen recalls the performance of Natalie Portman ’03 in Zach Braff’s 2004 film “Garden State.” Like Portman, Imogen’s blissful detachment from reality makes any emotional hurt all the more palpable.
Another highlight of the show is Danner’s portrayal of Hans Esss, the man hired by Charlie’s employers to oversee the restructuring process. With a flamboyant Austrian accent that brings to mind Sacha Baron Cohen’s “Bruno” (dir. Larry Charles). Danner casually doles out maxims like “remember, mein freunds, it’s not called compulsory overtime because it’s fun.” Gillen’s Charlie is contrastingly earnest and highly realistic. In a world otherwise full of hyperbole, he remains the most convincingly human character.
In the minimalist black box theater, auditory voiceovers, sounds of the city—and then woods—and visual projections form a cohesive atmosphere. Permeating the darkness with advertisements and infomercials, the set is enveloped in the same frenetic lifestyle that suffocates Charlie. When he opens an image of the aurora borealis on his MacBook, its immediately calming aura manifests itself not just in Gillen’s facial reaction, but also in the blue, purple, and green lights that lightly radiate ‘from’ the laptop across the rest of the barren stage.  Throughout the play, the lighting design of Elizabeth Y.Y. Mak ’12—whether it evokes a fluorescent, inescapable office cubicle or a mind-bending hallucinogenic fantasy—consistently reflects the emotions of every character.
Set designer Scott J. Roben ’12 makes creative use of the space not only on the ground, but also up on the wraparound balcony. First the balcony shows distance across airwaves, and then it serves as a ledge while hiking. The minimal use of props—which consist of poster board, computers, coffee cups, and a backpack—makes the staging and use of light the standout visual elements of the play.
The main engine of the piece, however, is Gummerson’s piercing social commentary. With lines like “why do we spend all our time riding in little metal boxes?” and references to the “telephonic plague,” Gummerson’s unique language and nuanced understanding of technology’s inherent flaws are brilliant. Instead of worshipping the ways in which the internet and cellular phones have connected the world, Gummerson questions the actual importance of these devices when it comes to friendship and love. While the actual plotlines sometimes seem contrived, it is the message, not the story, that drives “Inside Out” forward.

Authors sometimes enjoy using literal actions to symbolize deeper meaning; a Shakespearean actor might physically walk away from a difficult situation to represent his emotional distance from the other characters.  Similarly, the physical action of wandering takes center stage in Teju Cole’s debut novel “Open City.” The book opens with an image of the aimless wanderings of its protagonist, Julius. There could be no more appropriate beginning for this meandering plot, exploring not only Julius’ soul, but isolation and loneliness in a world where one is constantly surrounded by people. Cole explores the realities of being an immigrant and an outsider, and concludes that loneliness is the only universal commonality.
The plot is simple: it follows several months in the life of Julius, an apparently normal psychiatric resident from Nigeria, but Cole soon reveals the character’s dark secrets. Julius’ mother is German, his father Nigerian, and in no place does he feel at home. He went to college and medical school in the United States, but thinks of himself as a ‘brother,’ in denial about the extent to which he remains unassimilated. As Julius reflects on his experiences, his profound loneliness becomes clear. He notices a man who has just finished the New York City Marathon and “thinking of Phidippides’ collapse, saw the situation more clearly. It was I [Julius], no less solitary than he but having made the lesser use of the morning, who was to be pitied.” In moments of epiphany like this, Cole draws out the hidden meaning from quotidian situations that normally pass without comment.
“Open City” seems to slide past, almost as a stream of consciousness, lacking quotation marks or any clear punctuation. Cole fails to mark the difference between a character’s thought and his speech, and his smooth style draws not only from Julius but the people around him. The book does not need clarification, though, because Julius’ narration draws from and is influenced by the people around him. Thought is interchangeable with dialogue, and the smallest details from the present are enough to bring any character’s past memories to the forefront. Cole offers the experience not of reading a traditional story, but of reading a man’s mind.
The “Open City” of the title seems at first to be New York, a city of immigrants, a hub of the diversity and activity that Julius seems to crave. But Julius leaves New York, and travels to Brussels to make a halfhearted attempt at finding his maternal grandmother. There, Julius discovers that the immigrant’s feeling of isolation is not unique to America, and that the ‘brothers‘ of Europe feel as marginalized as the ‘brothers’ of America. After Julius is mugged, he begins to wonder how much he shares with his fellow immigrants.
His experiences in Brussels make him questions his status as an immigrant as well. A dinner in Brussels with two recent Morrocan immigrants makes Julius begin “pretending to an outrage greater than [he] actually felt,” as he argues with them about the meaning of the 9/11 attacks and al-Qaeda. As his dinner companions, Farouq and Khalil, embark on an extremist rant about Zionists and dictators in the Middle East, Julius realizes he feels nothing—not an attachment to their causes, and not an attachment to that which they’re fighting against.
Julius’ soul-searching is not restricted to the present; his past is also incorporated into the novel in a way that allows it to be not only context, but part of the present story. As Julius himself reflects, “we experience life as a continuity, and only after it falls away, after it becomes the past, do we see its discontinuities.” The novel is structured so that the past becomes part of the continuous narrative, and it only gradually becomes clear that Julius’ musings on the past are more than just his thoughts—they affect his present. Julius claims that “Nigeria was like that for me: mostly forgotten, except for those few things that I remembered with an outsize intensity.” In those moments that Julius remembers Nigeria, we discover that his childhood, although mostly forgotten, forged him into the adult he becomes.
As Julius’ tawdry past is revealed, the reliability of his narration comes into question. As in any first-person narration, one must wonder whether the narrator is himself changing his story to make himself a hero. As a psychiatrist, Julius himself doubts the truth of his patients’ stories. He feels that all men want to be heroes, if only in their own eyes, and he will change his story to become one.
Soon, the plot of “Open City” becomes irrelevant, and Julius’ narration continues as a series of memories and musings, twisting together with tangents about bedbugs and history. Cole wraps it up with a surprise that feels unsurprising, and an satisfyingly unresolved ending for Julius. When he is finally forced to confront his past, a shocking revelation feels anticlimactic—but for a character as isolated as Julius, such an ending is wholly appropriate. The book is a melancholy reflection that “to be alive, it seemed to me, as I stood there in all kinds of sorrow, was to be both original and reflection, and to be dead was to be split off, to be reflection alone.”

What are the social responsibilities of art? Are artists morally obligated to try to improve the societies in which they work, or is the only goal worth striving for ‘art for art’s sake’? These questions have been challenging artists of all sorts for millennia, and have provoked a wide spectrum of creative responses. In the arts, abstraction and political relevance are not necessarily opposed to one another, and some have tried to create highly stylized works that still convey a clear message to the audience.
One such work is Ntozake Shange’s choreopoem “for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf,” which confronts the racism and sexism faced by African-American women in an experimental form of performance poetry. This play, combined with its unofficial sequel “for black boys who have considered homicide when the streets were too much” by Keith Antar Mason, forms the basis for Jon E. Gentry ’07’s adaptation “for colored girls / for black boys.” Despite its abstraction, the new production by BlackC.A.S.T. manages to convey a rare emotional intensity. Under the direction of Rachel V. Byrd ’13, it starkly demonstrates the problems facing modern African-Americans while still remaining hopeful.
“for colored girls / for black boys,” which ran in the Adams Pool Theatre from March 3 to March 5 as the finale to Harvard’s 2011 Black Arts Festival, is structured as a series of monologues delivered by unnamed characters. In this regard it is similar to “The Vagina Monologues,” but with a much broader scope: along with women’s issues, each vignette is a meditation on various challenges faced by the African-American community. These range from rape to racism; they also include more personal issues like relationship problems.
The show was brilliantly acted, and the cast managed to portray each vignette as both an individual unit and as part of a larger whole. This in itself is challenging, but the ensemble also faces the dilemma of expressing a whole range of emotions without the aid of dialogue or character development. Despite their namelessness, each character was fully fleshed out. Their segments were self-contained while still providing a sense of continuity.
The real standout in the show was behind the scenes. Byrd left the stage totally barren in terms of scenery, and filled the space with her cast instead. By taking advantage of her actors’ physicality—in one monologue an actor literally flung himself around the stage and off the banks on the side—she gave them total freedom to put their emotions in tangible, visible terms. Physical theater like this is right on the cutting edge of modern theatrical practice, and Byrd effectively integrates this new style into her production.
“for colored girls / for black boys” also made creative use of music and dance. Many vignettes were framed by hip-hop and rap tracks, and some even incorporated music into the actual monologues. One segment is a meditation on the power of Nina Simone’s music delivered in highly rhythmic poetry. It uses internal rhyme and repetition to create a speech structurally similar to a song. In another scene, music played over a monologue was used to create a nightclub setting. The music pulsed with the delivered lines to complement the emotional peaks and valleys of the scene.
Although most action was on the main stage, the performers also made good use of the sides of the old pool as well as the iron girders that hold up the ceiling. Two monologues took place on the stairwell behind the audience. The liberal use of the space complemented the bare physicality of the production. It allowed the audience to concentrate on the emotional and psychological aspects of the play without being distracted by superficial details.
“for colored girls / for black boys” was a very rare piece of theater. It was challenging but unexpectedly funny at the same time. It was expressed through poetry, but the characters delivering the lines were ordinary people that we can relate to with  no trouble. Its apparent internal contradictions make this a hard work to pull off, but the cast embraced these nuances and created a bold and compelling show.

There is something satisfying about a road narrative; it’s an ancient trope, hinting of westward expansion and independence, fast cars and tragic youth. The antithesis of this would naturally be the traffic narrative, which is unpopular for obvious reasons. It has everything Americans hate—a hero cooped up alone, forced into inactivity, and at the mercy of idiots. Mark Kelesniko’s new graphic novel, “Freeway,” is that narrative. Isolated, frustrated, powerless protagonist Alex is trapped in his car at a dead standstill on the freeways of Los Angeles, Calif.. A road narrative has, at its center, an iconic vehicle, but in a traffic narrative, it is the windows that matter most; Alex’s car, in fact, is unidentifiable. As he fumes, the story becomes a journey through his life, dreams, and desires, some of which materialize to haunt him on his way to work. Kalesniko invites readers to look past Alex to see some familiar faces pass by.
Kalesniko has revived Alex Kalienka, from “Alex” and “Why did Pete Duel Kill Himself?,” to chronicle one torturous morning commute on the Los Angeles freeway. Alex, a layout artist at 2D animation studio Babbit Jones Productions, daydreams as he drives. He recalls a disastrous relationship with a co-worker, his first lonely trip to Los Angeles in the seventies, and the career he would have had during the Golden Age of animation—a career much closer to his childhood dream.
Intricately rendered and carefully constructed, the pages of “Freeway” are detailed without being overwhelming. Though Alex inches along, Kalesniko moves at a fast clip through his protagonist’s ranging memory, squeezing complicated narratives, dreams, and visions into 414 pages. The one upside to traffic is the time it gives one to think; “Freeway” is a haunting exploration of the nostalgic, and often depressing, thoughts of a man who just can’t seem to get where he wants to go, in more ways than one.
Alex, a character that Kalesniko has said he first invented as a child, wears glasses and has a few wisps of hair, like many men approaching middle age. Yet, his muzzle and floppy ears set him jarringly apart from his coworkers and fellow commuters. Despite his childish cartoon origins—he more closely resembles his employer’s Bugs Bunny clone, Muck, than he does other humans—his face renders him almost inscrutable. Although Alex’s face isolates him from the world, it doesn’t go as far as the blank faces of the animals in Art Spiegelman’s “Maus” or the total foreignness of the Bone cousins of “Bone.” It is cute yet pathetic, a perfect complement to the way Alex is trapped on the freeway, at his job, and in his love life.
Kalesniko has a clean, geometric drawing style that lends itself well to accurate depictions of Los Angeles and the never-ending columns of automobiles. It contrasts dramatically with Alex’s animation style and even Alex’s face itself. Kalesniko seems to have a love for traditional animation, judging from his admiring portrayal of an earlier era of cinematic cartoons, as well as the inclusion of Alex’s gifted mentor. Presented in opposition to an ambitious but untalented rival, the character shows Kalesniko’s clear preference for traditional artistry and experimentation over cliché merchandizing tie-ins. The characters of the two time periods are rendered slightly differently: those in the present day approach caricatures, with Charlie Brown hair and dots for eyes. Alex’s doppelgänger and his friends are not realistic, but they are certainly less cartoonish. A group photograph looks like it could have been drawn by Edward Gorey. Alex, of course, stands out, but he might do so more in a story with a consistent look. At times, the people he meets seem less human than he does. Perhaps this is Kalesniko’s way of noting a relaxation today in animators’ work ethic and artistic goals, or pointing out a growing rift between age and maturity, or emphasizing the beauty of a dream over the mockery of real life. Because Kalesniko does not differentiate the style of Alex’s thoughts and dreams, his purpose is unclear; yet, by maintaining a more even design across stories, he links them together to further isolate Alex.
Near the end of “Freeway,” Alex’s co-worker tells him, “Animation is a lot like sausages. You shouldn’t see how it’s made.” One could certainly debate his claim; after all, sometimes a museum-goer likes to be reminded of the artist’s existence with a fingerprint or a dab of paint. However, despite Kalesniko’s lovely hand-drawn style, with the rare inclusion of computer-manipulated panels, he might have done well to refer back to his character’s advice. The few spots where he does rely on Photoshop to create the illusion of a shift in time but not space, are somewhat disorienting. The choice makes the art look dated earlier than it should be. Elsewhere, Kalesniko masterfully uses close-ups and sequencing to suggest aging or a change in scene, so his use of computer graphics is confusing. CGI and Photoshop are most effective when they are either the primary medium or entirely unnoticeable; Kalesniko’s inclusion of these techniques is neither.
The destination of this anti-road narrative is not, as one might believe, Alex’s office, a converted warehouse sometimes infiltrated by pigeons, but Alex’s early demise. Kalesniko shows death scenarios over and over again, freak accidents all, but originating entirely in Alex’s mind. As Alex lies on the ground, burnt, broken, smashed, passers-by approach to fill the page’s narrow panels, looming uncomfortably large, necks craning to hear Alex’s last words. He imagines his gruesome death, but also the sole moments in which he connects on a personal level with those glimpsed only through two sets of car windows. It seems Alex cannot form relationships, whether romantic or professional, with others without damaging himself. It is a depressing conclusion, but Kalesniko approaches his long-suffering protagonist delicately, balancing his dreams and his failure in a perceptive combination of artistic talent and psychological acuity that lingers in the mind long after Alex has escaped his traffic jam.

“Mama, what goes on here!” exclaimed Sergei Eisenstein, upon first seeing Aleksandr Dovzhenko’s groundbreaking and famously gnomic 1927 film “Zvenigora.” “A horse painted white, a ship with a pointed prow, a monk either buried or disinterred, a horde of mounted Cossack robbers!”  Though Vladimir Sorokin’s “Day of the Oprichnik” has a far more linear narrative than Dovzhenko’s film, the reader is similarly bombarded with a sea of brutal, surreal images: a nobleman hanged on the iron gates of his palace, an orgy in a bathhouse, a murderous police force getting high by eating golden fish, a soothsayer who speaks her predictions by the light of a pile of burning Russian novels.
“Day of the Oprichnik” takes place in a totalitarian state, headquartered in Moscow. The year is 2028. Russia, perpetually a landscape of utopian vision and dystopian nightmare, is plunged again into a state of fear. Welcome to New Russia: Ivan the Terrible has returned, in the form of a new and ghastly monarch. The hero of the novel is Komiaga, a member of the czar’s elite inner circle—the ‘oprichnina,’ named after Ivan the Terrible’s brutal warriors, often called the world’s first secret police. We are privy to Komiaga’s interior monologue as he engages in a typical day’s activities: your average murder of political enemies; a few jiggers of vodka here and there; flights to Siberian provinces; a public flogging; the suppression of a populist bard; a few lines of cocaine; some blackmail; and a number of encounters with the debauched royal family. Sorokin turns the familiar genre of the dystopian novel—as exemplified in “Brave New World” and “1984”—on its head, filtering bewildering impressions of this new world through a hero who is the fearsome instrument of state power. In your typical dystopian novel, the reader becomes acquainted with a new world through a Joe-Average-type protagonist, a cog in the bureaucratic wheel—think Winston Smith or Bernard Marx, the protagonists of “1984” and “Brave New World.” Sorokin’s Komiaga is anything but a cog: he is “a link in the iron chain of the oprichniks,” a figure that revels in—and helps to create—the nightmarish social context of New Russia.
Capitalizing on the wildest dreams of Russian nationalists, Sorokin’s novel, superbly translated by Jamey Gambrell, engages in a kind of hyper-Russophile kitsch. In the novel, Russia has chosen to cut itself off entirely from the Western world, and has built a great wall to keep out its decadent influence. The characters engage in the most Russian of customs, many of which will be unfamiliar to Western readers. They whip each other with birch branches in a steambath; they down glass after glass of kvass, a traditional Russian drink made of fermented rye bread and marinated cabbage juice. The oprichniks don velvet pants, broadcloth caftans, and shirts embroidered with Russian Orthodox crosses. The country quavers before the czar, the Church, and most of all the oprichniks, driving along in red Mercedovs affixed with the traditional symbols of the oprichnina: a severed dog’s head and a steel broom. At once fanatically pious and morally bankrupt, the oprichniki murder and rape without qualm, but refuse to let curse words pass their lips on the czar’s order.
Employing the requisite hyperbole of the dystopian novel, Sorokin demonstrates the most grotesque elements of Russian nationalism in the warped mirror of their imagined fulfillment. He is unflinching in his depiction of the state censorship and casual racism that plagues Russian culture, all fervently embraced by his debauched, fanatic antihero.  The figure of the secret policeman has powerful echoes in the recent history of Russia––notwithstanding its current president, known for his distinguished service in the KGB. Sorokin imagines a future in which Russia, propped up in its economic weakness and increasing dependence on China by a front of oil and gas, is choked under the mailed fist of state oppression and nationalist rhetoric. This vision strikes an uncanny chord in any observer of the country’s current repressive political environs.
“Day of the Oprichnik” is an exhausting read: the reader must consent to his imprisonment in the brutal confines of Komiaga’s conscienceless consciousness. Sorokin relentlessly subjects his audience to a dizzying progression of New Russian experiences. In marathon, day-in-the-life format, Sorokin attempts to establish both the political and cultural status of New Russia. Jamey Gambrell’s translation commendably conveys the full vibrancy of Sorokin’s prose, including his forays into poetry and complex wordplay. The oprichniks’ eyes well up with tears at the sappy poetic hagiographies broadcast on New Russian radio, and they persecute the anonymous author of satiric poems mocking the royal family. The prominence of poetry in the book recalls the Soviet suppression of Russian poets: Mandelstam, Pasternak, Akhmatova, and countless others, condemned to exile or worse for a misplaced syllable or a subversive strophe.
For the Western reader, “Day of the Oprichnik” caters both to Orientalist fascination with Russian traditions and fears of their violent potential. Sorokin’s merciless imagination is often disturbing, and the savage glee of the text mesmerizes. We proceed through Komiaga’s day, held in thrall, as he is, by the divine will of the czar and its violent consequences. One of many fascinating episodes in the novel is Komiaga’s encounter with the obese empress, who awakens at dusk and breakfasts at midnight; hauntingly, she lets loose the fear that the people of Russia abhor their authorities, quietly brewing in impotent rage. “They’re envious because they’re slaves. They know how to pretend. But they don’t really love us, the powerful. And they never will. If they had the chance—they’d cut us to pieces.” Komiaga dismisses this claim, but the statement rings throughout the rest of the book. For all its bizarre situations, Sorokin’s wild romp leaves behind a sobering image: that of a populace bridling, like the reader himself, against a violence that seems endless.

Michael Dowse’s new film “Take Me Home Tonight” centers around Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who happens to be great at math, but not so great at deciding what he wants to do with his future. Matt, his twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his best friend Barry (Dan Fogler) attend a wild Labor Day party in 1988 suburban California that changes the course of their lives, and sets Matt on a journey to course correct his aimless existence.
True to its setting, the movie is one big ’80s party, appropriately filled with drugs, sex, and rock and roll. Within this environment, “Take Me Home Tonight” effectively mixes subgenres, combining vulgar humor and more traditional comedy to attract, rather than alienate, its target audiences. Thus, for each penis joke or botched sexual encounter, there is a corresponding element of more sophisticated wit.
The film is also part romantic comedy. The plot is a familiar one: boy chases after unattainable girl and lies to impress her. She likes him. Then he tells the truth. She doesn’t like him. He proves himself. She likes him again. In other words, the storyline—like that of many pop romance flicks—is more functional than original. As such, for “Take Me Home Tonight,” it is the winning acting of the leads and secondary cast which sustains the film and enables it to transcend its tropes.
Topher Grace’s character of the gifted but meandering Matt Franklin is not particularly novel. As with his most famous role of Eric Forman in “That ’70s Show,” he is again cast as a loser who eventually gains self-respect, and with it, coolness. It’s not a groundbreaking arc, but it works perfectly for Grace, whose slightly awkward disposition makes all of his characters believable. Opposite Grace, relative newcomer Teresa Palmer plays Tori Frederking, Matt’s love interest. She is well suited to the role of the beautiful, out-of-your-league girl who ends up becoming relatable after all. Once again, the character arc is fairly textbook, but Palmer sells it.
The two romantic leads are buoyed by a superb secondary cast. In her portrayal of Wendy, Matt’s twin, Faris demonstrates a side of her acting repertoire that few audiences have seen. Playing against type, Faris gives a serious—and at points even heartbreaking— performance, and thereby demonstrates that she has a far greater dramatic range than one might expect from her prior work. Similarly impressive is Fogler, whose hysterical antics as Matt’s wingman Barry light up the film. Fogler nails the role of the quirky, overweight best friend, and at times evokes the best of “Superbad.” Throughout the film, he offers no moral guidance; his sole purpose is to encourage Matt to do stupid things, and his persistently terrible decisions—from car theft to snorting cocaine while driving—prove consistently entertaining.
While “Take Me Home Tonight” won’t win any Academy Awards, it’s probably one of the more entertaining movies of 2011 thus far, despite its formulaic elements. A large part of the movie’s value comes from the relatability of its plot, which focuses primarily on the unsettling uncertainty that plagues everyone from college graduates to anyone moving on to a new stage in their lives.
The film’s prescribed cure for this existential angst is choice—taking a leap of faith into the life’s next stage and hoping for the best—and refusal to make this choice is the greatest sin that the movie’s characters can commit. Thus, when Matt apologizes to his father for being a failure, his father responds, “no, you’re worse than a failure. You’re worse than a failure because you didn’t even try.” The film is filled with poignant moments that call for its characters to take risks and face their fears about the future, a situation to which many viewers can easily relate.
By grounding itself in an effectively conveyed life lesson rather than forgettable punchlines, “Take Me Home Tonight” elevates itself beyond the stockpile of cliches out of which it is constructed.

“There’s no place for the gunslinger anymore. We’re civilized now.” These words are spoken by the mayor of the town of Dirt to Rango, the town’s sheriff and film’s namesake (voiced by Johnny Depp). While it may be true that Westerns are a genre of the past, there’s certainly still a place for them in Hollywood, as demonstrated by recent successes like “No Country For Old Men” and “True Grit.” “Rango,” directed by Gore Verbinski, is a parody of this genre that seems intent on diminishing the value of the Western and its cinematic traditions—complete with a melodramatic mariachi band, incompetent bandits, and silly square dance rituals. But despite all of its mockery and self-deprecation, “Rango” is a charming film that reflects only positively on the genre that gave it birth.
The movie’s opening introduces an as-of-yet unnamed protagonist—a pet lizard in a fish tank with a flair for the theatric. In a most amusing vocal performance by Johnny Depp, the lizard acts out imagined dramas alongside a dead insect and wind-up goldfish, with Depp providing all the voices and personalities. But the lizard soon finds himself embroiled in a real-life adventure when he is accidentally abandoned by his owners in the desert, and left to fend for himself with only the Hawaiian tee on his back.
The lizard makes it to the town of Dirt, where trouble is brewing—the water supply is running out, and the all-too-aptly named town is overrun by corruption and lawlessness. Eager to carve out an identity for himself and establish his acting bona fides, the lizard invents a backstory in which he is a fearless hero from the deep west named “Rango.” After he accidentally slays the town’s feared scourge—a hawk—he becomes revered by the townspeople and earns the sheriff badge.
With a motley crew of companions, newly christened Sheriff Rango embarks on a quest for some desperately needed water for the town. What follows is delightful parody of the Western canon, ably executed by Depp, and the ensuing comic mischief and genre impiety are strongly evocative of another convention-busting comedy collaboration of Depp and Verbinski—“Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl.”
Rango soon finds his chief nemesis to be the town’s mayor (Ned Beatty), a wizened tortoise in a wheelchair whose dialogue is suspiciously Obama-esque. “[The people of Dirt] believe that tomorrow will be better,” he tells Rango. “They believe in you.” Of course, he’s a crook—not unlike Beatty’s deceptively wholesome Lotso character from another animated dramedy, “Toy Story 3”—and Rango spends the rest of the movie uncovering his secrets and combating his corruption.
Throughout this cartoonish jaunt, the strength of “Rango” lies in its self-awareness and self-conscious parody. Most amusingly, the film’s Western storyline is framed for the audience by an owl mariachi band with thick Spanish accents. The group provides the film’s faux-outback soundtrack—in reality composed by Hans Zimmer—and their absurd commentary throughout the movie is a constant reminder that we are sitting in a theater, watching a Western comedy narrated by owls. In this fashion, “Rango” proudly revels in its absurdity.
Like many animated flicks, “Rango” relies heavily on allusions to outside culture—but unlike those in many other contemporary animated features, these references enhance rather than overwhelm the film’s satire. Rango and his compadres ride off into the desert Monty Python style, complete with melodramatic strings as musical backing. There is a play within a play, nodding to Shakespeare, and a flight sequence—with bats—cleverly reminiscent of World War II fighter flicks. And of course, an obligatory Clint Eastwood lookalike a la “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” shows up late in the film to impart some inspirational words to the young hero.
When “Rango” begins to drag, as it does toward story’s end, it makes up for its narrative shortcoming with its crisp, gorgeous visuals. Indeed, the film’s meticulous attention to detail—from rotating shards of broken glass bottles hanging outside saloons to the gentle sliding of the desert sand—is a tribute to its CG artists at Industrial Light and Magic, for whom “Rango” is the first fully animated feature.
With its persistent self-deprecation and swipes at its own seriousness, “Rango” has the feel of a film with simple, unoriginal intentions—a typical children’s comedy marketed to the usual target audience, with colorful visuals for the kids and cultural asides for their parents. But the film’s gags and charms end up being more than the ostensible sum of the parts. Sheriff Rango, too, starts out with few real aspirations, initially stumbling through the desert to act out a personal Western fantasy, while lacking any genuine identity or commitments of his own. But like its eponymous hero, “Rango” creates an identity out of the myths and legends of the past, and soon becomes an unwitting Western classic itself.

Watching the five Oscar-nominated live-action short films in succession—as they are being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art on selected days this spring—is quite the schizophrenic experience. Since the Academy makes no distinction in this category by genre or nationality, these films range from absurdist comedy to high melodrama, and hail from countries like Belgium and Ireland. The shorts’ eclectic mix of styles and influences might be a detriment to the viewing experience, if the five films were not of a uniformly high quality. As it is, these short films take audiences on an emotional rollercoaster to rival the best of feature-length cinema.
If one thread connects the five otherwise disparate nominees, it is the presence of children. In “The Confession” (dir. Tanel Toom), two small Catholic boys misinterpret the importance of their first confession and commit an innocent prank in order to have something to confess—a prank that spirals quickly out of their control. “Wish 143” (dir. Ian Barnes) features a teenage boy with terminal cancer who tells a charitable foundation along the lines of Make-A-Wish that he wants to lose his virginity before he dies. “The Crush” (dir. Michael Creagh), a highlight of the evening, is the story of a remarkably brave primary schooler who challenges his teacher’s boyfriend to a duel for her affections. And the only non-English language film of the night, “Na Wewe” (dir. Ivan Goldschmidt), centers on a young boy suspected of being Tutsi during the Burundi genocide, and who becomes a flashpoint in the ethnic conflict. The only exception to the rule is the actual winner of the award, “God of Love” (dir. Luke Matheny), a surrealist comedy starring a socially inept singer and darts player who is given a box of “love darts” with which he attempts to woo his long-time flame.
“God of Love,” contrary to the Academy’s decision, is not the best film of the five, despite its undeniable charms. To its credit, the film’s black and white, Charlie Kaufman-esque aesthetic is an effective companion to its strange storyline. Lead actor and director Luke Matheny is excellent as Ray, delivering his dialogue with perfectly calibrated deadpan existential angst: “As you know, I’ve been praying for your assistance in winning the affections of one Kelly Moran, which I’ve been consistently clear is the only thing I have ever really prayed for, at all,” he complains in an aside to God. But for all its endearing oddities, “God of Love” leaves viewers a little unfulfilled, since the easily guessed revelation of the piece’s conclusion drains the film of dramatic tension early on. Though the Academy deserves some credit for their decision to recognize a comedy—a rarity among the long-form awards—the left-field humor of “God of Love” cannot match some of the other contenders’ emotional impact.
At the other end of the spectrum from “God of Love” is “The Confession,” whose opening shot—two boys dragging what appears to be a body through the woods—sets the tone for a deeply affecting film about unexpected consequences. The film is propelled by its adolescent leads’ acting and stunning cinematography, which complements the piece’s languorous pacing and rural setting with extended shots of fields and—in one particularly touching moment—the two young boys lying on their backs on a blanket of brown leaves. Lewis Howlett as protagonist Sam exudes genuine confusion and loss as the plot spirals out of his control, and the film’s final scene—in which he breaks down in the confession booth—is the most wrenching moment of the evening.
It isn’t the best, however: that honor belongs to “The Crush.” Eight-year-old Ardal Travis (Oran Creagh) is one of the gutsier male leads in recent romantic comedy memory, challenging his teacher’s boyfriend to a duel to the death and bringing what appears to be a real gun to the confrontation. “Are you just gonna stand there and watch one of your second classers blow my head off?” the boyfriend (Rory Keenan) asks Miss Purdy (Olga Wehrly). “Have you not seen ‘City of God?’ Get a fuckin’ cop or something!” Creagh’s utterly flat delivery is comic genius, and the film’s final reversal makes “The Crush” the most rewarding of the five nominees.
The final two shorts, though still excellent, pale slightly in comparison to these two. “Na Wewe” rests on a brilliant premise, upending expectations for a film about genocide to make an incisive point about the fluid nature of ethnic identity. But perhaps as a result, the plot never rises to a climax. Instead, the film’s redemptive moment—in which the Hutu militants are distracted from their interrogation by a U2 song—comes off as slightly preposterous. “Wish 143” similarly rests on a reversal of expectations. Though the teenage lead is convincingly distraught, the film lacks the memorable flair of its competitors.
The five in sequence, starting strong with “The Confession” and ending with the victor, create a remarkably cohesive, powerful film-going experience, despite—or perhaps because of—the pieces’ spanning such a wide range of genres and emotional timbres. Together, the shorts serve as an excellent reminder that great filmmakers do not confine themselves to the feature-length format.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Completed in 1655, Harvard’s Indian College was designed to be a hotbed of Puritan missionary activity. The college also housed a printing press, then operated by the aptly-named James Printer, a student and a member of the Algonquian Nipmuc tribe.
Printer and his press—the first on the North American continent—would later be of great use to John Eliot, an English proselytizer. After more than a decade of painstaking labor, in 1659 Eliot completed his translation of the Bible into Wampanoag, which he had learned while living among Native Americans in ‘Praying Towns.’ These settlements were founded for the express purpose of exposing Native Americans to Christian enlightenment, and Eliot regularly delivered sermons in Wampanoag to the ‘Praying Indians’ of Natick. Published in stages at the Indian College between 1661 and 1663, Eliot’s Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God (“The-whole Holy his-Bible God”) was the first Bible printed in North America.
Though Eliot’s work may present moral problems from a modern perspective, it is difficult to imagine the intellectual responsibility and ambition required to convey ‘the word of God’ in a foreign tongue. Such a weighty endeavor brings with it both the possibility of great achievement and the looming threat of inadequacy. For contemporary expert and amateur translators at Harvard, the task of translation involves a confluence of fear, anxiety, and intimidation. The root cause of this distress lies in the creative, historical, and political complexities found in translation.
THE MODERN EAR
The tradition of translating ancient texts is still alive and well at Harvard, although it has lost curricular prominence since Harvard’s founding. Undergraduates in the Classics Department are the most active constituents in the niche community of translators at Harvard. The Classical Club, founded in 1885, translates and stages an ancient drama every spring. This year, the club is putting on their new version of Sophocles’ “Oedipus Rex,” which opened March 4 and is running through March 12.
The club’s modus operandi is to alternate Latin and Greek plays each year and shop around for interested directors once the translation has been completed. This pattern fell through last year, when the club’s translation never reached the stage. This time around, the creative process was reversed. “We decided to do ‘Oedipus [Rex]’ this year because [Meryl H. Federman ’11, director] was planning to do ‘Oedipus.’ She wasn’t happy with the translation, so we decided to work with her,” says Classical Club co-president Arthur D. Kaynor ’12, who is also working as a producer and ‘Translation Captain’ for the new production.
According to Federman, the initial translations she surveyed were dense and ornate, rendering the play’s drama unintelligible. “I was very excited to find the Classical Club because a lot of the translations [of ‘Oedipus’] are quite old, and the wording is quite highfalutin ... it’s very old-school, very poetic, overblown in what it sounds like when you hear it,” she says. “[In those editions] people are trying to approximate what it sounded like back then. They are going off of this style that is ultimately confusing today.” Federman’s task was to ignore rhetorical affectation and streamline “Oedipus” in order to make it relatable to a modern audience. “I wanted to get to the human story of it with a translation that is more accessible to the modern ear,” she says.
Members of the eight-person translation team for “Oedipus” brought home sections of the play for J-Term, each producing a literal, non-interpretive translation of his or her assigned segment. These disparate, individual translations were then joined into a single cohesive document. This draft was further revised by Federman, Kaynor, and Felice S. Ford ’11—the show’s other Producer and ‘Translation Captain’—to include language more stylistically suited to performance.
“My work has mostly been advising with the director and other production staff, especially during casting,” says Ford. She also helps to convey “aspects of the text that aren’t just in the text itself, the nature of Greek tragedy, the culture that produced it. There are still some things in terms of characterizations and staging when it does matter if you want to have an authentic production.” Staging classical texts, then, requires cultural transmission in addition to linguistic translation.
For Federman, the fear associated with translating “Oedipus Rex” has little to do with the work’s canonical status. In fact, directing a classic drama invites creative and original ideas. “You don’t want to do nothing,” says Federman. The anxiety of reinterpreting a text like “Oedipus Rex” lies rather in the multitude of creative options made possible by a new translation. For plays written in English, the range of interpretive possibilities is much narrower: “every line has a binary operation,” says Federman, to cut or not to cut. In translated plays, a director may actually create the text itself.
“It starts out terrifying, and gets really fun, because there are so many choices of what to do,” says Federman. “With something like this ... there is an uncountable number of things to do on every single line, and you have to make that decision over and over and over again. It becomes harder to change as you keep going.”
A director, however, must also confront the pressure of accurately conveying another’s work. “You are working with something that is not yours,” says Federman. “This is not an adaptation, it is the play itself. You need to have creative inspiration within a specific, narrow framework. There are times when you get stuck, because it is a creative process.” The central conflict, therefore, is between creativity and loyalty. “I think Sophocles would like this translation,” she adds with a smile.
BEAUTY AND SUBTEXT
Just as Eliot crowned his career with the Wampanoag Bible, a small set of undergraduates culminate their academic careers with a translation thesis. Ford is one such student, currently completing her edition of Euripides’ “The Bacchae,” a Greek tragedy centered on the god Dionysus’ revenge against his mortal family. Although Euripides’ drama is an oft-translated and oft-performed classic, Ford is attempting to contribute something original to her interpretation.
“My goal in the work overall was to be as true to the text as possible, but still produce a comprehensible and somewhat aesthetically pleasing version of the text,” says Ford. Her main goal is to reconsider widely accepted though antiquated translations, which distort the play’s content for a modern audience. “[Translated] texts pre-1950 or -1960 were very Victorian-sounding, [and used] high English,” she says.
Ford aims to make an aesthetic update. “I wanted to make something that could stand as a beautiful composition, but doesn’t do so at the expense of the true meaning of the words or the subtext that underlies them.” Her sentiment reiterates the tension Federman cites between interpretation and authenticity.
The greatest obstacle Ford has confronted so far lies in her efforts to translate the original Greek into verse English, especially the passages for chorus. “It is incredibly difficult to do the poetic sections. It’s hard to write poetry that sounds good in English but incorporates the meanings of the text.” Likewise, she adds, “I haven’t written poetry in a while, so it’s difficult on the personal side.” The process of translation, then, requires playing multiple roles: just as director Federman had to assume the part of translator, translator Ford must act as poet in her own project.
FREEDOM AND FIDELITY
Professor Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, Director of Studies for the literature concentration and Director of the Freshman Seminar Program, has taught Literature 109: “On Translation” for nearly two decades. The popular seminar examines translation from philosophical and theoretical perspectives, and each student is required to produce a large-scale, original translation over the course of a semester. “I am somebody who has for many years been fascinated by language and especially interested in philosophies of language, and in many ways thinking about translation ... [and] how meaning is made, how it crosses cultural boundaries,” Naddaff says.
Arthur L. Goldhammer—an affiliate at the Minda da Gunzburg Center for European Studies and English translator of more than 100 French works of history, philosophy, economics, literature, and criticism—has often visited the seminar to lend his expertise and guidance. His approach, however, is thoroughly unphilosophical. “My own approach to translation is that I don’t like to talk about it theoretically, I like to talk about it practically,” says Goldhammer. “I like to talk about the translation with the text in front of us. ... Translation is really a matter of hand-to-hand combat with the language. You really have to get up close to it,”
One trend Naddaff has observed throughout her years teaching Literature 109 is the anxiety students experience when confronted by the class’ final project. “Yes, there is always a tremendous sense of responsibility toward the author you are representing,” says Naddaff. “Young translators have an overdeveloped sense of this responsibility and concern to be as accurate and as literal as possible. ... More established, seasoned translators feel they can allow a certain interpretative dimension in their work.”
Inexperienced translators then try to serve the original text and its author by translating verbatim. This approach may lead students to get stuck in the minutiae of vocabulary rather than to consider the general effect or purpose of a particular phrase or passage. According to Naddaff, this student tendency reflects the looming fear of doing harm to a work’s legacy. “The fear is appropriate—that you are representing somebody, taking responsibility for the representation of someone’s work,” says Naddaff. “That’s a significant responsibility. The way that plays out theoretically is the tension between freedom on the one hand and fidelity on the other.”
Goldhammer does not believe there exists a distinction between interpretation and faithfulness. “I don’t like the opposition between freedom and slavish fidelity to the text,” he says. “Translating is like taking a musical composition and playing it on an instrument different from the one on which it was composed. A good player will try to get to the essence of the composition and use the resources of the instrument.” There’s no need to shy away from the advantages presented by the language of the finished product; rather, every translation is a full reconstruction.
“To me, the difference between English and French is like that,” says Goldhammer. “When I translate in English, I try to do what the author would have done if he had had the resources of English at his disposal.”
“PREEMPTIVE STRIKE”
Karla M. Cornejo Villavicencio ’11, a history and literature concentrator and semi-professional translator of modern Latin American literature, has experienced this same tension. Just last year, Cornejo published a previously untranslated interview between Jorge Luis Borges and Argentinian writer Héctor Alvarez Castillo in Harper’s Magazine.
“Touching Borges is like walking into a cathedral,” she says. For Cornejo, interpreting a legendary author like Borges imbues a translation with undeniable gravity. However, it also produces the fear that even the smallest mistake Cornejo makes will be blamed on her age, despite her years of experience as a translator. “If I fuck up, they’re going to be like, ‘She’s just a kid.’”
Cornejo observes this creative burden in the contrast between translating works of deceased writers and of those who are still living. “It’s different to translate someone who’s alive and [someone who’s] dead, because someone who’s dead can’t talk back,” says Cornejo. In other words, there’s a necessary opposition between “the canon” and “the guy you just emailed.” In that sense, the classic works of deceased authors are untouchable, and that distance elicits an elevated respect and formality that the works of living authors do not necessarily produce.
But translating a living author presents its own difficulties, both political and interpretative. “When you see a translated text, it’s another tool the writer uses when he knows he’s going to be translated,” says Cornejo. In her field of specialty, she claims that some authors plant specific scenes, paragraphs, or turns of phrase that mystify or elude the translator and the translator’s audience. Cornejo calls such a passage a “preemptive strike” or a “slightly malicious joke.”
What Cornejo terms ‘hot’ Latin American writers—those who expect to be translated for a mainstream American audience—“have moments which are inside jokes [to] intentionally leave out the cool kids,” says Cornejo. By doing so, some Latin American authors can preserve their material against translation and interpretation, thus granting special access to their local, Spanish-speaking readership. Elements of foreign work may resist translation not simply in artistic design but through roadblocks intentionally constructed by writers. The implicit argument in this obscurantism is that not all writing can be effectively translated.
For Goldhammer, translating living authors is complicated by the ongoing exchange between writer and interpreter. “Sometimes you will run across an author who has strong views of how his work should read in English that may at times conflict with your own views, and that can be a difficult kind of problem to resolve. You may wind up in a conflict with an author over his own style ... It takes some tactful negotiation,” Goldhammer says.
ACTA NON VERBA
Although a few students pursue translation within and beyond the academic program, the intellectual and creative obstacles inherent to the process of translation impede its popularity. Currently there is no centralized translation community at Harvard, and few professional translators or translation scholars work at the University. “There aren’t many people who are doing translation as a regular part of their scholarly work [because] it doesn’t leave a lot of time for teaching and publishing papers,” says Goldhammer. And, among those who do translate, there is no effective apparatus for communication. Goldhammer says that he was disappointed to find he and Literature Professor Leo Damrosch were both working on Alexis de Toqueville’s travel notes and letters at the same time without having any awareness of one another’s projects.
This absence of translation support and culture leaves Harvard without one of academia’s few opportunities for the immediate and concrete creation of cultural value. In making a foreign work accessible to a new audience, translation increases a group’s preexisting wealth of knowledge in absolute terms. It may be this responsibility that makes the substance of translation acta non verba.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Julia A. Rooney ’11 is a senior Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) concentrator in Mather House. She is currently working on her thesis project, a series of mixed-media paintings inspired by her time in Italy.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you first become interested in art, and painting in particular?
Julia A. Rooney: I went to LaGuardia High School in New York City, which has a studio art focus, and emphasized building a foundation of technical skills. When I came to Harvard, I was not sure that I wanted to continue on that track—I wanted to go to a liberal arts school, not a fine arts program. Then I realized that the VES program offers more of a conceptual framework than was present in the studio classes I took in high school.
THC: Do want to work as a professional artist after graduation?
JAR: I would like to make a living as an artist, hopefully. I obviously see that compensated by all kinds of things along the way—teaching, bartending, and doing any number of jobs which will not keep me confined to one place, or keep me in an office.
THC: What inspires you? Specifically, what gave you the idea for your thesis collection?
JAR: I guess it started freshman summer, when I spent two months working as a researcher-writer for [the Harvard-based student travel guide] Let’s Go! in Italy. When I was there, I had no creative impetus, which is surprising, because Italy is the country of artistic heritage. But it was such a fast-paced job that I had no time to delve into anything there. The artistic processing came in the aftermath, in the following year. I have returned to Italy for three summers now, to rehash everything that I’ve seen and experienced there.
THC: Can you tell me more about the project?
JAR: It primarily deals with painting, but I’m also interested in architectural spaces and paintings that are not just hung as canvases on a wall, but which also exist on other surfaces, such as panels, sheetrock, or wood. I see the paintings as artificial fusions and artificial spaces that I am creating, and the wood and the tiles are the deconstructed elements in those paintings. I imagine these elements existing side-by-side in an installation, so that these actual, physical objects inform the things I am representing in the painting. Italy, in a lot of ways, doesn’t make sense; it is a smorgasbord of different things which cannot be seen in a linear fashion. There is something which resonates with that kind of conglomeration, something which is pluralistic and not chronological or conventional, and that informs my practices as a painter.
THC: When can people look forward to seeing the installation?
JAR: The thesis show is April 28.  I imagine some of my paintings as somewhat contrived,  artificial, and almost gaudy or bombastic. On the other hand, some of my works have  strong architectural elements, such as panels which are eight feet high. These are on sheetrock, which is this beautiful, symbolic material to me. Sheetrock is like plaster, so it is like a frescoed surface. It is soft and it absorbs the paint in this beautiful way, but it’s also everywhere as a ubiquitous, cheap material that’s used in everyday modern structures. In the past, painting was never just on canvas; only during the Renaissance did painting become the practice of applying oil paints to canvas. Before that, paint was used as a decorative material, to create space; it was used on walls and objects.
THC: What message do you hope people will take away from the installation?
JAR: I hope that they see a correlation between the painted image and the object which I am placing next to it, and that each can be appreciated and understood in its own right. The final product is a presentation of space which doesn’t fully make sense, and I would like for that narrative to be conveyed. I want to viewer to come away with the understanding of a place as necessarily disjunctive and multi-sensory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a more than forty-year hiatus, University President Drew G. Faust announced last Friday that Harvard will officially recognize the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps.  Earlier this fall, Faust had publicly stated that Harvard would welcome ROTC back on campus if “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—a controversial law that banned openly gay citizens from serving in the military—were repealed. We commend the president for keeping her promise and reiterate that the time has come for the University to put a formal end to the outdated stigma it has for so long embarrassingly assigned to students who wish to serve their country.
Even though ROTC remains a divisive issue on campus, its return is now a reality, and the program as a whole will be recognized as a valid student organization eligible for funding and logistical aid from the University. This latter point is especially important given that—even with recognition—Harvard ROTC recruits will still continue to train at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In short, now that ROTC is set to become an official presence on campus, the University must take immediate action to ensure that the program and the undergraduates who choose to participate in it can be better incorporated into our community. They deserve no less.
One way this can be accomplished would be through greater academic facilitation of the ROTC program. First and foremost, the military science courses that ROTC students are required to take should be eligible for university credit. More should also be done to add components of military history to the College’s history course offerings at large, very few of which deal with topics relating to military history.
These additions and changes might help to eradicate the very real stigma that ROTC students feel at a place like Harvard—nominally committed to open-mindedness but in reality caught in prejudices of its own. In other words, it is one thing for the University to recognize ROTC; it is another for it to afford the program the support it needs to thrive. Undergraduates enrolled in ROTC’s programs for whatever reason should never feel they have something to hide, and the University must ensure that all its students—regardless of their interests, values, and beliefs—are afforded the same amount of respect and tolerance.
On that note, it might seem hypocritical to urge the University to increase tolerance for one group of students by recognizing an organization that excludes another sector of the Harvard community. After all, even though the repeal of DADT will permit openly gay citizens to serve in the military, transgender and intersex individuals are still prohibited from service, and ROTC would similarly prohibit Harvard’s transgender and intersex students from participating in its activities. Harvard also has a Non-Discrimination Policy, which states that any form of discrimination “based on race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, veteran status, or disability unrelated to course requirements” is inconsistent with the principles of the University. Given those facts, some may wonder how the return of ROTC can ever be justified.
Essentially, we believe that the military’s current discriminatory policies are deplorable and should be abandoned. There is no conceivable reason for the United States to deny certain citizens the right to serve their country, especially when countries such as Spain, Norway, and New Zealand have already passed legislation that welcomes transgender people into the armed forces. For the sake and conscience of all Americans, the United States military must be made to do the same. To that end, we also believe that the most effective way to eradicate discrimination within the military is through the involvement of progressive and powerful institutions such as Harvard.
Indeed, that America’s preeminent universities have turned their backs on the military for so long may be part of the reason their progressive values are nowhere to be found within its ranks. In order to see those values translated into realities, the answer is not to continue spurning the military but to embrace it and to seize an active role in reforming it. In the spirit of the Edmund Burke, who famously wrote that no one “makes a greater mistake than he who does nothing because he could only do a little,” Harvard should recognize ROTC in the attempt to reform from within a system with a major institutional flaw. We would all benefit from a more tolerant military, and, in true Burkean fashion, recognizing ROTC—rather than rejecting it—seems the most promising route to accomplishing that necessary goal at this point in time.
Now that Harvard has welcomed ROTC back on campus after the repeal of DADT, the University should do everything in its power to inspire that reform from within. Harvard’s administration should feel obligated to deliver on its promise that no student should face discrimination of any kind.
In conclusion, it seems odd that the student body as a whole was not involved more in the process of reinstating ROTC. Harvard’s boycott of the program has proved a highly incendiary subject for many years, one that many students continue to feel strongly about. Although ROTC students were consulted in advance of the recent decision, there is an obvious interest in discussing this issue throughout the student body. Had more students been involved and invested in the decision-making process behind this recent and momentous move, much of the controversy might have been better handled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There has been a lot of recent discussion about the College’s alcohol policy. Those of us in the administration are, as always, deeply concerned about dangerous drinking on campus, and thought it important to address some misconceptions about the issue.
Binge drinking—four or more drinks within two hours for a woman and five or more for a man—is not a normal part of social development or of “learning to drink.” It is a specific type of alcohol abuse that jeopardizes a person’s health and well-being. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a leading cause of premature death among students age 18-24 is alcohol-related injury. Nationally, more than 1,700 alcohol-related deaths occur each year. Furthermore, new research by Dr. Marisa Silveri, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, indicates that alcohol use by those under the age of 22 may impair brain development, particularly “executive functions” such as planning, memory and decision-making. It’s not surprising, then, that underage drinkers are more likely to experience problems in college, such as higher absence rates and poor or failing grades.
Aside from the fact that Harvard—like any University that receives funding from the federal government—must observe and abide by the national minimum drinking age of 21, there is a strong link between underage drinking and dangerous drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about one-quarter of youth who drink do so intensively. Far from furthering student social development, underage drinking is associated with social problems, violence, and a lack of participation in activities. Moreover, people who begin drinking before age 21 run a greater risk of developing alcohol dependence later in life.
The College’s alcohol policy is designed to safeguard the health of students and to create an environment that gives undergraduates the best chance to learn and grow at Harvard. Over the last decade, the College has built an extensive network of resources to address the problem of dangerous drinking and to educate students about the risks of drug and alcohol use. These resources include the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, AlcoholEdu, and Alcohol Communication and Education Skills training.
The College’s approach also includes an amnesty policy that allows students to seek medical care for alcohol-related illness with no fear of disciplinary action. In fact, this policy allows us to capture information about alcohol abuse that would previously have gone unrecorded or unnoticed. This policy may account for a good deal of the surge we’ve seen in recent years’ admissions numbers to Harvard University Health Services.
In light of these facts, it is puzzling to hear the calls from some quarters for a more relaxed policy on alcohol use and underage drinking. It’s even more confounding to see the Harvard-Yale tailgate used as an example of the need for this change in approach. In fact, the health and safety measures put in place for The Game—prohibiting alcohol from being brought into the student tailgating area and closing it at game time, prohibiting drinking paraphernalia that promote rapid consumption of alcohol, providing non-alcoholic drinks and food free of charge to all students throughout tailgating hours—have been a resounding success.
Although some undergraduates contended that no one would attend the tailgate in 2006, when the new measures were implemented, 9,200 students entered the turnstiles on the morning of The Game. The overall number of medical transports for acute alcohol intoxication were nearly eliminated between 2004 and 2006. The number of admissions to HUHS decreased by 87 percent, and the number of alcohol-related incidents/ejections decreased by 71 percent.
The lesson of The Game is that the development of a clear, consistently enforced policy can have a dramatic and positive effect on the problem of dangerous drinking and on student life at Harvard. Since 2006, this approach—modified to allow House Committees to bring beer and wine into the tailgating area—has contributed to a change in College culture. Increasingly, students see social activities not as an opportunity to drink themselves sick, but instead as a chance to connect with each other and to enjoy the signature events of their Harvard College experience. Continued oversight and education, not a retreat from the success of recent years, is needed to extend this trend, and to safeguard the health and safety of our undergraduates.
The College’s efforts to educate students on the topic of alcohol and dangerous drinking will continue.  To this point, I invite you to attend an event this Wednesday, Mar. 9 from 6 to 7:15 p.m. in CGIS S010 featuring a lecture by Dr. Marisa Silveri, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Associate Research Psychologist at McLean Hospital, titled, “The Maturing Brain and the Impact of Binge Drinking on Neurochemistry.”  Dr. Silveri will speak about the consequences of binge alcohol use on brain chemistry and how this impacts impulse control and cognition in the college-age population.  I hope you will join this interesting event to learn more about these effects.

Federal lawmakers narrowly avoided a government shutdown on Mar. 2, when they passed and President Barack H. Obama signed a temporary funding bill to extend government spending authority to Mar. 18. The extension was intended to give Congress more time to reach an agreement on spending levels for the remainder of the fiscal year, but chances of a compromise don’t appear much better than last week. House Republicans insist on a $61 billion reduction in non-defense discretionary spending, while Democrats warn that such a large cut would derail the economic recovery. There is now a real possibility that the budgetary standoff could lead to a government shutdown, which would likely backfire against the GOP. Republicans would do well to compromise on this year’s budget, and save their political capital for the much more important fight over entitlement reform.
While Americans favor budget cuts at the moment, Democrats are counting on Republicans to overplay their hand, and reduce spending by unpopular amounts to appease their Tea Party allies. A government shutdown, which would impact the daily lives of a huge proportion of the public, could easily sour voters on the GOP’s austerity agenda.
A government shutdown is a temporary suspension of nonessential government functions that occurs when Congress and the President cannot agree on spending levels. This last happened in 1995, thanks to a skirmish between President William J. Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Two back-to-back shutdowns late in the year resulted in the furloughing of several hundred thousand federal employees, as well as economic losses and tremendous inconvenience to a vast number of citizens. For example, the government closed 368 National Park Service sites, resulting in an estimated loss of $14.2 million per day in tourism revenues for communities near the sites. About 200,000 U.S. applications for passports went unprocessed, inconveniencing travelers and inflicting millions of dollars in losses on the tourism and airline industries. Veterans experienced major curtailment and delays in federal benefits, including medical services, and many employees of federal contractors were furloughed without pay.
Americans were infuriated with the shutdowns in 1995, and held the Republicans responsible—a CNN poll reports that 49 percent of the public blamed GOP congressional leaders. Only 26 percent blamed President Clinton, who used public outrage over the shutdown to stifle the ascendant Republicans in his 1996 bid for reelection. Recent surveys suggest history may repeat itself if the government is shut down this year. A Feb. 24 Gallup poll indicates that Americans favor compromise over a government shutdown by nearly a two-to-one margin.
A government shutdown runs a serious risk of alienating large numbers of voters from the Republican Party. And for what? The proposed $61 billion in cuts would make a small dent in the 2011 deficit, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will total close to $1.5 trillion. What’s more, Democratic concerns about the impact of these cuts on the economic recovery, while they must be balanced against the implications of the mounting debt, are well placed. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke conservatively estimates that the GOP spending reduction plan would result in the loss of a “couple hundred thousand jobs,” and Goldman Sachs projects it will reduce growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points during the second and third quarters of this year.
Amid this squabbling over a tiny portion of the budget, entitlements continue to grow at an alarming pace. The CBO reports that spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security is on track to increase from about 10 percent of GDP today to about 16 percent in 2035, and that this growth combined with declining revenue could cause the national debt to expand to 200 percent of GDP. Ensuring the solvency of these entitlements over the long term would do much more to restore confidence in U.S. fiscal responsibility than $61 billion in discretionary spending cuts, and will be necessary in the near future in any case. Social Security, which is projected to go bankrupt by 2039, is particularly ripe for restructuring.
No doubt $61 billion is significant, but it is small potatoes compared to the real work that needs to be done to rein in entitlement spending. The GOP would be foolish to squander the current outcry for budgetary reform by allowing a disagreement over a small fraction of this year’s budget to lead to a government shutdown. Republicans should compromise on 2011 spending, and capitalize on the national mood by addressing entitlements as soon as possible.

Throughout his six-month plunge off the deep end from being TV’s highest-paid actor to trashing hotel rooms, abusing cocaine, and dating multiple adult film stars while referring to them as his “goddesses,” Charlie Sheen has seemingly been living out every stereotypical college bro’s dark fantasy.
While the overwhelming majority of civilized society frowns upon Sheen’s out-of-control lifestyle—and I am no exception, despite how much fun the concept of having goddesses seems—his crazy escapades have given the former Two and a Half Men star a bizarre, newfound popularity. With his recent, earth-shattering entrance into the Twitter world, the celebrity spectacle that is Charlie Sheen has begun to approach levels unseen since the baby-dangling heyday of Michael Jackson.
Even so, the tidal wave of attention for Sheen and all things tiger blood is puzzling. Why should our society reward someone for living a reckless lifestyle complete with drug abuse, property damage, misogyny and ranting interviews?
The answer lies within the fabric of the nature of celebrity itself. The makeup of our society and the tools we offer to celebrities allows them to be famous just for the sake of attention. Our biggest cultural icons—Michael Jackson serves as a perfect example—often gain their celebrity stature simply by being completely loopy—and even loopier when the cameras are rolling.
Today, thanks to the pervasiveness of the 24-hour celebrity news cycle and the growth of social media like Twitter, the cameras are always rolling for people like Sheen. Accordingly, Sheen’s first tweets, which included triumphant declarations that he was “winning,” curious references to things like “tiger blood” and TwitPics of his goddesses, set off an almost instant Internet firestorm. He set a new Guinness World Record by earning one million Twitter followers in just over 25 hours and currently sits at over two million. Surely this is a claim to Sheen’s raging popularity, along with the fact that his tag “#tigerblood” has been trending on Twitter for nearly a week.
In a sense, Charlie Sheen is “winning”—he has successfully harnessed all of the tools available to him as a public figure and used them to the best of his ability. The modern celebrity doesn’t actually need to do anything legitimate or noteworthy to be famous (the cast of “Jersey Shore” is living proof of that point), and Sheen has fully taken advantage of this fact. By turning his Twitter page into a public running diary of crazy, Sheen has put the cherry on top of his bizarro fall from grace.
By slowly acting more and more insane, Sheen has become far more of an icon than he ever could have been by proceeding as a normal actor. Our favorite TV shows and actors come and go. A coked-up Charlie Sheen having regular sex with pornography stars and then spilling all of his thoughts to national media through nonsensical TV interviews, on the other hand? Now that’s a celebrity we’ll remember. That’s what winning looks like.

Marking the first day of Harvard Women’s Week 2011, a group of Harvard undergraduate women—and four men—from diverse backgrounds tackled false cultural perceptions of beauty at a gathering yesterday in the Adams Lower Common Room.
Hosted by the Harvard fashion group Styleta, the Association of Black Harvard Women, and Latinas Unidas, the conversation consisted of students discussing their own perceptions of beauty and inquiries into portrayals of beauty in the media and at Harvard.
Participants began by sharing their own perceptions of beauty before launching into the broader discussion.
One student presented her conception of beauty: “skinny, petite, long haired and white,” she said.
Participants posed a variety of questions that included why bleaching or tanning of skin is desirable for some people, as they sought to determine what actually serves to define beauty in American culture as well as in minority cultures, especially in African American and Latino communities.
Students expressed concern that lighter skin color is often portrayed as more attractive, saying light skin was a definitive characteristic of beauty in minority cultures.
Several Latina women related pressure they felt from their family to marry someone with a lighter skin tone.
“My grandmother thinks you’ll have better success in society if you have light skin,” said one Latina student.
Others expressed concerns with the impressionable effects of media portrayals of beauty.
“Sometimes I feel like people of the opposite sex expect me to be that way,” said Beverly E. Pozuelos ’12, president of Latinas Unidas and a Crimson editor.
Participants said that images of entertainers often inaccurately represent minorities.
“Most black actors, singers, entertainers are light-skinned,” said Ijeoma B. Eboh ’11, the event moderator and president of ABHW.
The discussion also tackled how perceptions of beauty at Harvard affect the participants, pointing out that a certain uniformity of clothing and accessory combinations can represent a particular level of socio-economic status.
One of the major take-aways from the conversation was that confidence is a universally attractive quality.
“Beauty comes from the inside, with confidence,” Erin D. Drake ’14 said.
Eboh said she hopes that the lessons of the discussion expand beyond the confines of the Adams LCR.
“I hope this conference shows that perceptions of beauty are something that can be changed,” Eboh said.
Drake said she would carry lessons from the event with her into the outside world.
“Everyone has insecurities about how they look,” she said. “At the end of the day, we are all beautiful.”

Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan, which announced in January that they were exploring a merger, have jointly decided to end merger talks and remain independent companies.
The two insurance providers, respectively the second- and third-largest in Massachusetts, announced the decision to end merger talks in a joint press release Friday. The release cited the logistical problems of integrating two large and complex organizations, stating that the “savings and efficiencies” the two companies wished to bring about through merging would be more difficult and time-consuming to achieve than originally thought.
“We made the thoughtful determination that while we are in the same business, our operations are very different and, in many important aspects, not fully compatible without significant changes to existing processes and applications,” said James Roosevelt, Jr. ’68, president and CEO of Tufts Health Plan, in the press release.
Harvard School of Public Health lecturer Nancy C. Turnbull, a former first deputy commissioner at the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, said that the lack of a “compelling factor” for the merger, such as financial risk, may have doomed merger talks. She said that this fact, combined with the complexities of each organization and their relationships with different national insurance providers, might have caused extra complications.
Turnbull also added that the companies may not have had enough time to work out preliminaries before the original announcement of the merger possibility was made.
“It seemed, when it was announced, that the news got out prematurely,” she said.
The failure of the merger, however, may be good for clients because it retains three strong, independent competitors which can keep market prices low, Turnbull said.
Blue Cross Blue Shield is the largest health care provider in the state, with more clients than Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts combined. A joint Harvard Pilgrim-Tufts plan would have been able to compete more effectively with Blue Cross, one potential reason for the original merger consideration. All three firms are not-for-profit.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan were rated first and second in the nation, respectively, in customer service and quality by the National Committee for Quality Assurance in 2010.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care maintains the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 20 undergraduate, graduate, and Extension School students gathered yesterday at a U.S. job-search workshop for international students, sponsored by the Office of Career Services.
The workshop was run by Dan Beaudry, previously a campus recruiter, who wrote a book called “Power Ties: The International Student’s Guide to Finding a Job in the United States.”
Recognizing the difficulty in securing work visa sponsorship—the reason that international students are often rejected from U.S. jobs—Beaudry emphasized the increased importance of networking for international students who are looking for American jobs.
Beaudry said that 80 percent of the jobs in the U.S. economy are never openly advertised, using the analogy of an iceberg, which typically has only a small portion of its body visibly showing above water. According to Beaudry, these hidden vacancies are often filled through a process called the Employer Referral Program, in which the companies rely on employers’ recommendations to find candidates suitable for certain positions.
“The person that is referred through the [Employer Referral Program] carries the implicit endorsement of someone that [the company] trusts,” Beaudry said.
Due to this characteristic of the U.S. job market, Beaudry said that it is not effective for international students to send their resumes to employers or to fill out online applications.
“It’s not an investment worthy of your time,” Beaudry said. “If you are not exactly the kind of person that they are looking for, you are not going to hear back.”
Instead, Beaudry encouraged students to reach out to hiring managers or build networks with other personnel who could help them get a job. The most effective approach, according to Beaudry, is to meet with people in relevant industries for “informational interviews,” where students can casually inquire into the nature of the work and present their merits.
Once international students build up their networks, it is important for them to be familiar with visa processes so that they can explain them to those in charge of hiring.
“They need to hear from you how easy it is before they know from Human Resources how hard it is,” Beaudry said.
Students attending the workshop responded positively to Beaudry’s presentation, surrounding him afterwards to talk and to purchase his book.
“He’s the only one [I’ve talked to] that knows exactly what happens to international students after we finish school,” said Claudia Garcia-Wagner, a Colombian student at the Extension School studying environmental management and a research assistant at the School for Public Health.

While University officials focus on raising money for House renewal and development in Allston as goals for Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign, Allston residents are skeptical about how high of a priority the revitalization of their neighborhood will be.
Residents fear that with the University focusing on the renovation of undergraduate housing, Harvard’s holdings in Allston will not be developed any time in the near future.
“Allston’s always the first priority after other things,” local resident and Harvard-Allston Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton said.
Last week, University President Drew G. Faust said that Harvard continues to be committed to Allston and that the University is continually searching for practical ways to move forward on developing Western Avenue given the available financial resources.
Specific future developments in the neighborhood, however, remain unclear.
“People here are really tired of looking at Harvard’s empty warehouses and underutilized properties,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said.
Over the past year, the University has leased its property to 13 businesses and non-profits in the area including Genzyme, the Silk Road Project, and the Boston Boxing Club, according to University spokesperson John D. Longbrake.
“Harvard owes us something,” said longtime resident Tom Lally. “Harvard made a deal with us through the science center that they would make the neighborhood better.”
After halting construction of the Allston Science Complex due to financial constraints in Dec. 2009, Harvard is now in the planning processes of building an Innovation Lab—a space where locals and University affiliates could discuss and realize their business plans through collaboration.
The Allston Work Team—created by Faust due to the halted construction—is also scheduled to make recommendations this summer. Decisions about the University’s capital campaign will not affect the Work Team’s efforts, which concern the short- and long-term development of Harvard’s properties in Allston, according to Bill Purcell, co-chair of the Work Team.
“We are looking for ways to move forward as best we can, in ways that Harvard never looked before,” said Purcell.
Residents, however, are unsure if renovations will happen in the near future.
“Harvard talks in centuries, not in months and years,” said Lally. “We didn’t think it would take such a long time.”
According to Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications, the capital campaign will not make Allston less of a priority for Harvard and improvements—such as the I-Lab, the Charlesview development, and the library park—are underway.
Asked how Allston may fit into the larger fundraising effort, Faust said in an interview last week that “Allston is a very important part of the future of the University.”
Still, Mattison feels something more is needed to make Allston a full priority.
“It will take a major change of heart from people who make decisions at Harvard,” Mattison said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections.
CORRECTION: MAR. 8, 2011
The Mar. 8 article "Allston Residents Concerned About Harvard Capital Campaign Priorities" incorrectly referred to Tom Lally as Tom Willey. His correct last name is Lally. Additionally, the story misattributed a statement by a University spokesperson about Allston's priority in the forthcoming capital campaign. The statement was made by Kevin Casey, associate vice president for public affairs and communications.

New York Times columnist Frank Rich ’71 said professional journalists will continue to be important despite changing forms of media at yesterday’s ceremony for the Goldsmith Awards in Political Journalism.
Rich, who received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at the ceremony, acknowledged that the advent of web-based media has created “business riddles” that future generations will have to solve.
“The answers will not come overnight,” Rich said. “There will be much trial and error and some journalistic institutions will suffer, as many already have.”
He said that the value of journalism lies in its quality and in the depth of professional reporting, dedicating his award to “the many more journalists that will be accepting this honor in years to come.”
The former chief theater critic for The New York Times, Rich became an op-ed columnist for the paper in 1994. He announced last week that he is leaving the Times this June to become an essayist and editor-at-large for New York Magazine.
Rich, a former Crimson editorial board chair, brought up his time at Harvard and said his journalistic career began blocks away from the JFK Forum, where the event was held.
He said that even during his college years, journalism was an evolving field.
“Back when I was on The Crimson we were determined to reinvent journalism too,” Rich said.
But he said the modern collegiate newspaper has changed since his time.
“I don’t think it occurred to any of us that there would ever be newsrooms without typewriters and the acid smell of ink and clouds of smoke,” he said.
He brought up the achievements of fellow Crimson editor Michael E. Kinsley ’72, a former Crimson vice president, as an example of the changing status of media. Kinsley started his career in print journalism, moved on to televised political punditry, and eventually founded “Slate,” an online magazine.
Rich also commented on Harvard’s recent flirtation with Hollywood.
“It’s nice to be at the set of ‘The Social Network,’” Rich said at the start of his speech.
The Goldsmith Awards in Political Journalism, given by the Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, annually recognizes authors of academic books and investigative journalism pieces for literary and journalistic achievements.
In addition to honoring Rich, the Center awarded Goldsmith Book Prizes to Tim Groeling, Patrick J. Sellers, and Jack Fuller.
Six finalists were recognized for their achievements in investigative reporting. The Las Vegas Sun’s Marshall Allen and Alex Richards won the $25,000 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting for an expose revealing the prevalence of preventable diseases and injuries in Las Vegas hospitals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Min S. Lee ’13 arrived at Harvard, he planned to carry on a treasured family legacy by becoming a doctor. Many of Lee’s aunts and uncles, as well as his older brother, had already become physicians, and Lee was ready to follow the path from college to medical school—until he spent a summer implementing a water chlorination project in the Dominican Republic.
Lee has since decided to shift his focus from the premed track to a career in international development.
Like Lee, Marissa A. Glynias ’12 had planned to become a doctor before she came to campus.
After shadowing a doctor during her sophomore year of high school, Glynias developed an interest in vascular surgery, which led her to enroll in an introductory biology course through the Harvard Summer School Secondary School Program.
Glynias, now a joint Anthropology and Music concentrator, decided not to pursue medicine. She spent her past summer working at an archaeological dig in Georgia, and she is currently considering graduate programs in archaeology.
Lee and Glynias are two of many students who have chosen to drop the premed track after exploring other options at Harvard—not necessarily because they do not like medicine, but because they have found another discipline that they prefer.
“Some students come here and are motivated to pursue medicine because they haven’t really thought about lots of other options,” says Lee Ann Michelson ’77, director of premedical and health career advising at the Office of Career Services. “They get to Harvard and they start seeing lots of other paths.”
Michelson says that while approximately 20 percent of students informally declare an interest in pursuing the premed track when they first arrive on campus, only seven percent eventually apply to medical school as seniors.
Most former premeds say that their interest in medicine declined when they discovered more exciting opportunities that were better suited to their skill sets.
“This is the wonderful thing about college—as soon as you enter, you’re exposed to a variety of things, things you never knew existed,” says Xiang “John” Du ’12, a former Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator who is now an Economics concentrator considering a career in finance.
WHY PREMED?
It is not unusual for premeds at Harvard to get eye-rolls and knowing sighs when they announce their pre-professional plans, and students and administrators say they are not surprised at the large number of students who initially express an interest in medicine.
“I think the reason why most people want to be premed, speaking just from my experience, is that’s the thing they’re most familiar with,” Du says.
“You grow up going to doctors. You grow up watching TV shows about medicine, like House and Grey’s Anatomy—that’s the thing you’re most exposed to,” he says.
For Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator Jeremy L. Hsu ’11, an interest in medicine arose largely from an early passion for the natural sciences.
“I’ve always been attracted to science, and felt that medicine was an ideal path in that it could combine my scientific aspirations while allowing me the opportunity to help other people,” he writes in an e-mail.
Hsu decided to shadow a physician during his sophomore year, an experience that did not “click.”
Hsu, who had previously attended two major science conferences and had found himself intrigued by a life in research, ultimately decided to pursue graduate school in biology rather than medical school.
“Those conferences really showed me the breadth of the field and inspired me to join that world of research,” he writes.
According to Hsu, the heavy class load he has undertaken as a premed—which includes courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics—complemented his OEB coursework and broadened his education.
Students and administrators also say that the structure of the premed track makes it initially appealing to many.
“If I say I’m premed, I know what courses I can take and what I can do,” says Oona B. Ceder ’90, assistant director of premedical and health career advising at OCS.
Ceder adds that the stability attached to the medical profession generates cultural and economic pressures—especially among first-generation college students—to become doctors.
“Students are interested in making a living and medicine has always carried a valid reputation as having a fairly sure employability and income attached to it,” says Ceder.
THE PREMED EXPERIENCE
Many students come to Harvard having excelled in the natural sciences and mathematics during high school, and assume they should become doctors because they are good at those subjects.
But some discover they have academic passions that lie elsewhere.
For Glynias, this realization came when she enrolled in the popular premed course Life Sciences 1a.
Glynias says that she did not find the course material compelling, which  prompted her to explore other fields of study. Her freshman spring, she decided to enroll in an ancient art history course, a choice which significantly impacted her decision to stop pursuing the premed track.
“The subject matter was interesting and science was not going to be worth it, so I stopped taking premed classes after that,” Glynias says.
As a sophomore, Glynias decided to register as Harvard’s only joint concentrator in music and anthropology—a rare mix combining her interest in music with her passion for archaeology.
Glynias attributes her positive experience in her joint concentration to the small class sizes in her fields of study.
“One of the hardest things about Life Sci was that there were 600 people,” says Glynias, adding that her biggest music class to date has had an enrollment of a mere 35 students.
Du agrees with this sentiment, adding that small classes tend to appeal more to students.
“Ec10 [is] a very large class, [but] the thing that made Ec10 so rewarding was that it is almost entirely taught in section, whereas premed courses are taught in lecture,” says Du.
Several premeds also note that the premed atmosphere at Harvard can at times be “suffocating.” Students have frequent problem sets and typically work late nights and spend hours in lab.
Although students like Du, Glynias, and Hsu say they switched out of premed after discovering their interest in another academic discipline, Michelson and Ceder say that there are many students who choose to leave the premed track because they receive a bad grade on their transcripts.
“Some students come here and ... they might get the first C of their lives, and it’s a shock,” says Michelson. “I think there’s some misinformation that they’ve heard that they’ll never get into med school, and that’s actually not true at all.”
“Medical schools really don’t just look at your science and overall GPA,” says Ceder, adding that factors like personal experiences, extracurricular interests, and diversity also play an important role in the admissions process.
MINING THE OPPORTUNITIES
Many students attribute their desire to explore fields outside of medicine to the wealth of opportunities that the College provides.
“I think it’s nice for people to explore around,” says David Wang ’12, current president of the Harvard Premedical Society. “At Harvard there’s a great premed track, but I don’t think it’s for everyone.”
Du says that realizing that he enjoyed the immediate applications of economics meant that a career in finance would be more suitable.
“I can literally take what I learn in class and immediately apply it to what is happening in the world,” Du says.
Glynias, who plans to spend her summer on a joint thesis project, says that she plans to keep her career options open.
“It’s completely worth it,” Glynias says, adding that her main requirement for a future career is that it be “fulfilling.”
For Lee, the task of exploring new options takes place both in the classroom and the real world. He says that enrolling in courses relevant to his interests—including health policy, statistics, and Spanish—has been a satisfying complement to his summer experience.
“My long-term goal right now is ... to work for an NGO or an international global health agency like UNAIDS or WHO,” says Lee. “My ideal job would be to play a direct role in helping design a healthcare system in a developing country.”
Du emphasizes that at Harvard, the wealth of resources and opportunities actually makes switching out of premed a viable option.
“I think if I had gone somewhere else, I wouldn’t have been able to learn about the things that I’m more passionate about now,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria stressed the importance of global leadership skills at an event last night co-sponsored by Conversations with Kirkland and the Leadership Institute at Harvard College.
Nohria, who was rejected from the Harvard Business School MBA program when he applied as an undergraduate from India and consequently enrolled at MIT Sloan School of Management, spoke about the evolution of business leadership in the 21st century.
“Our image of leadership is in so many ways grounded in our understanding of American business leaders,” he said. “As leadership becomes far more diffuse, I think our very ideas of leadership will change themselves.”
“If I were graduating today from IIT [the Indian Institute of Technology] Bombay, I’m not sure if I would still come to the United States for my graduate degree,” he continued.
Liora N. Simozar ’13, one of the event organizers and a member of the Leadership Institute, commented on Nohria’s call for a greater emphasis on globalized business education through Business School curriculum changes intended to increase students’ exposure to international businesses.
“So much of what Dean Nohria said rang so clearly with me about Harvard and the school’s need for globalization to keep up with the rest of the world,” she said.
Previously co-chair of the Leadership Initiative at the Business School, Nohria also stressed the lack of communication at Harvard between undergraduates and students at the professional schools. To foster new relationships between the MBA candidates and students at the college, Nohria reaffirmed plans for a new academic space, called the Harvard Innovation Lab, on the Business School campus.
“What we’re trying to do with the Harvard Innovation Lab is to create a space where people from across the school can trade ideas and talk about how to make amazing businesses out of them,” Nohria said. “We’re also going to create courses on entrepreneurship that will be taught by HBS faculty and will be open to Harvard undergraduates.”
Tiffany T. Niver ’08, the event’s moderator and a first-year student at the Business School, said that the Innovation Lab embodies Nohria’s commitment to connecting the Business School to the rest of Harvard.
“It’s one facet of the University that’s going to get people to start interacting more and rethinking the ways that the University will be able to act more fully together,” she said of the Innovation Lab.
Chelsea Ann S. Yeh ’14, who is considering pursuing a career in business, said that after hearing Nohria’s talk, she was “motivated and encouraged to explore [her] career as a Harvard undergraduate, not to be close-minded, and to make something out of the college experience.”
Addressing potential Business School applicants in the audience like Yeh, Nohria provided advice on crafting a career that is both rewarding and multi-layered.
“Think harder about what your passion is and what you want to do and stop being so obsessed about what your first job is rather than being open-minded about what your career may evolve into.”

Harvard’s improvisational comedy troupe The Immediate Gratification Players has named Wayne Brady as the Immediate Gratification Player of the Year for his accomplishments in improvisational comedy, and the troupe will honor his talent with a show performed in his honor on March 25.
This is the second year the group has given the award, as last year the troupe honored “Curb Your Enthusiasm” co-star Jeff Garlin.
Benjamin W. K. Smith ’12, the Czar of IGP, said that the group picked Brady because, as a cast member of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?”, he inspired many members to do improvisational theater.
“Wayne Brady is improv comedy,” IGP member Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 said. “The chance to spend the night with him is a total honor.”
Brady, the host of “Let’s Make a Deal,” has guest starred on a myriad of television shows.
Smith said that when the troupe brainstormed candidates to honor this year, Brady was “at the top of their list,” and that they were thrilled when Brady agreed to come and perform.
Unlike other awards that bring celebrities to campus, Smith said that the show honoring Brady will be interactive and open to the entire Harvard community.
Levin-Gesundheit said that IGP members will present Brady with one of their signature red and yellow neckties, making him an honorary player of the troupe. IGP will then perform improvisational comedy based on monologues that Brady will deliver. A portion of the show will allow the audience to ask Brady questions.
Smith said that this award was specific to actors with significant achievements in improvisational comedy, an area of acting that is often overlooked.
“[The Player of the Year Award] is very specific to improv comedy,” Smith said. “We decided to start this last year because we really wanted to recognize people in improv.”
Smith said that although many actors have backgrounds in improvisational comedy, their efforts and talent in the art are rarely awarded.
IGP is one of two improvisational groups on campus, and was founded by freshmen in 1986.
Since then, the troupe has performed for various audiences on and off-campus, and its annual comedy festival attracts troupes from around the nation. The group published a how-to book about improvisational comedy for students earlier this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kyle Casey received the ball in the right corner, pump faked, and took his man baseline. The forward took off of one foot, elevated, and posterized a helpless defender.
While Casey has performed a number of awe-inspiring plays during his career on the Harvard men’s basketball team, this was perhaps the most spectacular—and certainly the most important.
The slam, which came with less than 17 minutes to play in the Crimson’s Saturday night matchup with Princeton, gave the Harvard a five-point lead and helped propel the Crimson to a 79-67 victory and at least a share of its first Ivy League title.
“His athleticism not only helps with the obvious blocks and rebounds, but even when he doesn’t block a shot, the other teams have to respect his jumping ability,” freshman wing Laurent Rivard said. “Oftentimes [his athleticism] forces [opponents] to alter their shots, and offensively, it allows him to shoot over taller defenders.”
Averaging 10.8 points and six rebounds per game, Casey exploded Saturday night with a 24-point performance, adding four rebounds and a block against the Tigers.
“First off, Princeton is a really good team and they played well, but we finally played a full forty-minutes of basketball,” Casey said. “Offensively we stepped up and collectively as a team were able to put together a game worthy of the win.”
The forward brought the crowd to its feet on two separate dunks, but it was his ability to finish around the hoop and knock down mid-range shots that forced the defense to respect his game both inside and out.
Casey was hitting most of his field goals early and often, finishing the first half with 17 points.
“After I hit my first couple of shots I started to get into a rhythm,” Casey said. “My teammates kept feeding me, and whenever I could, I tried to take advantage of the bigger defender because I was quicker off the dribble.”
Casey was hot all night, shooting 9-of-13 from the field and six-of-seven from the charity stripe. But it was his two dunks that will be most remembered.
“Dunks are good for swinging the momentum of the game,” Casey said. “Finishing strong around the rim gives us a spark that can make playing defense easier because it gives us energy and can dishearten the other team.”
His ability on offense and defense can be seen on his stat line and the highlights, but his intangibles have helped to put the Crimson at the top of the Ivy League.
“Kyle makes me better as a player because he is a great teammate,” Rivard said. “We have captains on the team, but everyone listens to everyone. We all want to improve, and since he has more experience, it’s good to have him to talk to during the game.”
Casey missed the first three games of the season with a broken foot and has been ailing from other injuries throughout the year, but has played through the ailment.
“He fights through his injury and really focuses on the game rather than his injury,” Rivard said. “We can see [the pain he’s going through] but he never complains about it. His dedication is the reason we have won many important games this season.”
Casey also contributed to Harvard’s blowout victory over Penn on Friday, supplying four points, three rebounds, and an assist.
In addition to his 10.8 points and six rebounds per game, Casey is averaging .8 steals, and a block for the Crimson this season.
“[Kyle’s] play has been tremendous,” sophomore guard Christian Webster said. “He has put our team on his back many times this year and [Saturday] he did it again when we needed it most, the biggest moment of our season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until Saturday night, I had assumed that the Harvard-Yale football game at the Yale Bowl in 2009 would be the best athletic event I would get to see as a student here.
I was wrong, and I’m lucky that I was.
The Harvard-Princeton basketball game at Lavietes last weekend was more than just a milestone for the school.
We know that the Crimson won its first-ever Ivy League title.
And with some help from the Tigers, the team could waltz at the Big Dance for the first time in over 60 years next week.
But even beyond the obvious, the game was a first—for me and for Harvard—in so many ways.
People were actually excited about the game when I walked into Lowell dining hall for a quick pre-game dinner.
Those who hadn’t gotten a ticket were scrambling to find the biggest screen that allowed for easy ESPN3.com access.
And it wasn’t just students who watched. I received a semi-regular stream of “I saw you on TV” texts throughout the game—granted, a few came from my mother—as fans from all over took an interest in the long-suffering basketball program.
Walking back to campus after the win, pedestrians broke out into an impromptu rendition of “10,000 Men of Harvard,” and perhaps more unexpected than the sing-along itself was the fact that most of the fans seemed to know the lyrics.
Perhaps most surprisingly, students didn’t get to the Pavilion on Harvard time. They didn’t even arrive at the start of the game at seven. The student section was filled 25 minutes before the game—commonplace by the standards of some schools, to be sure, but unheard of at a place where a 7 p.m. meeting doesn’t start until 7:20 and a 10 p.m. party doesn’t start until 11.
This was certainly a party.
As I settled into my 10th-row seat (a misleading name, considering I never got to sit) sandwiched between the women’s soccer team, my brother, and another Crimson sportswriter, I quickly realized I would have to tolerate a spot in the stands that didn’t allow for the most comfortable viewing.
The anticipation grew until the Tigers came onto the floor, and they were promptly met with a cacophony of jeers fitting a Richard Wagner rendition of Hava Nagila.
Whether Bill Simmons—in attendance and who once said that “the list of insufferable jerks from Princeton is longer than all the other Ivies combined”—joined in is unclear.
Despite the excitement, the matchup was not the best basketball game I had ever seen, and the best play was at the beginning. The Crimson and the Tigers went back-and-forth for the first 10 minutes of the game, and it remained knotted through the first half. Only a last-minute Princeton foul from behind the arc gave Harvard the chance to take a one-point lead into the intermission.
As the Crimson pulled away in the second half, the crowd became increasingly more raucous. Harvard opened it up with solid play in the paint, clutch free-throw shooting, and consistent rebounding, never letting the Tigers get too close.
For better or for worse, that’s not what the fans in attendance will remember.
To the sports fan in me, that’s a disappointment.
To the Crimson fan in me, that’s how it should be. I can always go back and watch Kyle Casey’s dunk on YouTube, and I certainly have.
But it’s impossible to recreate the elation that came with it. I won’t recall which Princetonian he beat to the rim, but what I’ll remember is high-fiving total strangers who shared the moment with me.
We all know that it was just a game. Certainly, it was an important one, and possibly the most significant in the history of the program, but it was still just a game.
What made it special was the atmosphere. For a few hours on Saturday night, the school was unified because of this basketball game.
Watching Casey control the game’s momentum in the second half was memorable. Chanting “I believe that we just won” in the waning seconds of the game, falling onto the people in front of me, and getting ready to storm the court will be the stories that I tell.
Don’t get me wrong—I’m very excited for the next few days of Harvard basketball.  In the words of Mel Brooks, “it’s good to be the king.” The Crimson, even if just for the next few hours, holds that throne alone.
As I rushed out of the stands after the game, my glasses nearly broke, and I really couldn’t see anything more than the haze of the masses bouncing around and streaming towards me. But in a way, I’m glad that I only remember the blurred pandemonium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to continue its success after a strong fall season, the Harvard sailing team easily cruised to its first victory of the spring season this past weekend in Bristol, R.I., winning 16 out of 18 races on its way to capturing the Sharpe Trophy.
After finishing the fall season as the top team in New England, the Crimson’s ranking will allow the team to enter into the higher-tier regattas later in the season. But for now, the Harvard sailors were more than ready to hit the water and race in the windy conditions of Bristol.
Although the fall season is more focused on fleet racing relative to the spring, which centers more on team racing, the success from the fall provided the Crimson with the right reputation necessary to compete in the more competitive regattas.
Teams from Harvard, Roger Williams, MIT, Brown, Boston College, and Yale made up the field at the Sharpe Trophy Team Race.
Seniors Alan Palmer and Teddy Himler and junior Brendan Kopp represented the Crimson as skippers at this second-tier six-team event, while seniors John Stokes and Meghan Wareham and sophomore Alma Lafler sailed as crews.
Despite Harvard’s success at the Sharpe Invitational—the team dropped only two races over the course of two days—the sailors viewed the event as a way to gain experience working as a team in the windy and chilly weather more than anything else.
“It was very much getting your feet wet for the first time. It was good to get out there and practice,” Wareham said. “It was a second-tier regatta. We weren’t really competing against the more elite competition.”
“Only we and MIT sent our best teams,” Himler added. “This regatta was about honing our skills and about making the right plays in the right situations. It was very blustery out there. We know that in the next month, we’re not going to see conditions as rough as [Sunday], but we know we can handle them.”
On Saturday, the Crimson competed in 10 races and dropped only one, a close contest to the Engineers.
“The races that were in doubt were more helpful because we needed to practice maneuvers, like against Roger Williams, where we weren’t in a stable winning combination [like first and second place],” Palmer said.
The next day, the team, now 9-1 and two races ahead of the second-place Hawks, was determined to hold its lead.
But Harvard’s standing did not alter the team’s tactics.
“I don’t think it changed the way we sail. We were certainly confident, which is an asset out on the water,” Himler said. “We just needed to stick to the fundamentals. We were all psyched to go back and continue that lead, and it took a little pressure off.”
The races on Sunday started with a round robin between each of the six teams. In the first five races, the Crimson only lost once, this time to the Bears, allowing them to enter in the final four with a 13-2 record.
In the final three races against RWU, Brown, and MIT, Harvard stuck to its fundamentals and did not lose a single race.
“On Sunday, we were able to get into a combination in a race that was good for us,” Palmer said. “Oftentimes, we were able to pass just by using our speed. We had some pretty good races with Roger Williams, but we had to make some plays when we were in a losing combination, and this weekend, we acted on those plays. For most of them, though, we finished first and second, so it was a pretty easy win.”
At the end of the day on Sunday, the Crimson won 16 of its races and lost only two over the course of the two-day tournament.
But the experience gained over the weekend was more important than the win.
“It was great to train in those kinds of conditions,” Himler said. “Looking forward, we’re going to do a very competitive regatta at St. Mary’s and Navy. We’re going in with a strong team, and hopefully we’ll continue to bring home the W’s.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two big stories dominated the Ivy League this weekend. First, Emma Watson announced that she would take a temporary leave of absence from Brown. But the Harvard men’s basketball team (almost) made up for that loss. Facing a do-or-die situation, Harvard chose the former, riding to its first-ever Ivy League championship. Shockingly, other teams played over the weekend too. In squash, Harvard dealt with an unexpected loss, while a Princeton player became the first American to win it all in two decades. Take a break from those midterms, as we explain it all in another edition of Around the Water Cooler.
So in case you haven’t heard, Harvard had a pretty good week in men’s basketball. After beating Penn, 79-64, the Crimson came back the following night and, in the biggest game in program history, beat visiting Princeton, 79-67. The contest received national coverage, with airtime on ESPN3 and a number of tweets by Bill Simmons (who, in the best tweet of the night, wrote, “No. 33 from Princeton just killed a puppy”).
Of course, Harvard’s ticket to the big dance hasn’t been punched quite yet: Princeton has to lose one more game. The Tigers travel to the Palestra tonight to face off against Penn (7 p.m. on ESPN3). With a win over the Quakers, the Tigers and Harvard will duke it out one last time in a one-game playoff on Saturday at 4 p.m. at Yale.
But, not everything this past weekend went so swimmingly for Harvard. In women’s basketball, Harvard fell to Princeton, 68-59, at Jadwin Gym on Saturday night. With the victory, the Tigers clinched the Ancient Eight crown for the second year in a row. The women of Princeton have been dominant at home, winning their last 22 at Jadwin.
In more bad news for the Crimson, Harvard No. 1 Laura Gemmell lost for the first time in her college career to Yale No. 2 Millie Tomlinson the finals of the CSA Individual National Championship. Worse, Gemmell failed to take a single set from her Bulldog opponent. Last year’s national champion, Gemmell, now holds a career record of 32-1.
From start to finish, the tournament belonged to Tomlinson. Though the seventh seed coming in, the Derbyshire, U.K., resident didn’t lose a set all tournament en route to her first Ramsay Cup.
On the men’s side, Princeton’s Todd Harrity cruised to the individual national championship, making him the first American to take the Pool Cup since Jon Bernheimer ’90 won the title for Harvard.  Harrity’s finals victory over Cornell’s Nick Sachvie concluded an undefeated season for the Princeton number one, who suffered his last loss to Colin West ’10 in the 2010 individual championship.
Harvard’s freshman phenom Gary Power had a tough tournament, falling in the round of 16.

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and  rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few  days. Click here to read more about the series.
The House of the Hare is best described as "accommodating." Although Leverett House has many advantages and disadvantages, the variety of housing options and decent location push this River House into the top two-thirds according to our ranking system.
Dining Hall: Leverett dining hall certainly has its ups and downs—mostly downs. On the plus side Leverett residents enjoy a friendly kitchen staff, efficient grill chefs, and 24-hour access to the drink machines and cereal dispensers. However, the layout of the dining hall is awkward, leading to frequent traffic jams. Although Leverett appears to have a large dining hall, it tends to get crowded during peak dining hours. Additionally, the food at brain break doesn't last long, and the dining hall is often populated late into the night by frantic physics students checking problem sets. Good thing every room in DeWolfe has a kitchen, right?
Facilities: Leverett Junior Common Room isn't exactly intimate, and even though the extra space makes for some sweet stein clubs, it isn't exactly a good spot to get work done. There is, however, a large library located between the Leverett Towers and McKinlock—the main building of Leverett—complete with a private study room and a computer lab. The Old Library isn't actually a functioning study space but rather a great location for numerous events including theatre productions. The G tower's "G-spot" features a TV and couches and is a prime location to relax. For the athletically inclined there is an excellent gym underneath A entryway.
Rooms: Fortunately, Leverett offers its residents a variety of housing options, including rooms in DeWolfe, spacious tower suites, and classic neo-Georgian rooms in Old Leverett. Finding your ideal rooming situation in Leverett is probably easier than in any other House. Since Leverett is the largest of the upperclassmen houses, with almost 500 students, even if you had trouble picking blockmates, or decided to float, there is a good chance you will be able find roommates that you like.
House Spirit: It's difficult to establish cohesiveness in a House that is divided into so many different buildings, but despite such obstacles Leverett does a decent job. The mascots of Leverett pride come from none other than the House Masters, the Georgis.  The Georgis, nicknamed "Chief" and "Coach," make an effort to get to know the residents and are reportedly strict police on Leverett community dining nights. Although many might mourn the loss of the annual ’80s dance, there are a number of other events that House committee organizes throughout the year, including popular stein clubs.
 
Location: The long walk to the Science Center might not be far enough to warrant a shuttle like the walk from Mather House, but it certainly puts Leverett in an awkward spot. Additionally, Leverett isn't exactly close to athletic facilities or the Square. The Charles River, however, is easily accessible—a major plus for the month of so that it's warm enough to spend time outside.
Quirks: Leverett has many qualities of a good House, but not much else. The tunnels under McKinlock are pretty interesting and have some hidden treasures, including a well-hidden foosball table.
Rating: Because of its poorly-designed dining hall and lack of House spirit, this year Leverett House is ranked eighth out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
8. Leverett
9. Currier
10. Mather
11. Winthrop
12. Cabot

A vegan searching for dessert has a tough dilemma: that sugar cookie might not seem so sweet if you can't sleep knowing that the butter in it came from a factory farm. Thanks to Natalie C. Padilla '12, not only can you now indulge guilt-free, but you can also help fund an animal rescue group that provides safe homes to abused livestock.
For 10 weeks, Padilla is baking a different variety of vegan cookie each week and selling her animal-friendly sweets at Boloco on Mt. Auburn Street. The proceeds will be donated to The Farm Sanctuary Inc, a charitable organization.
This week, Padilla is selling vegan carrot cake cookies with cream cheese filling (made from soy milk) at Boloco. If you can't wait to make it over to the burrito joint, Padilla shared a recipe with Flyby which you can make on your own.
Happy Cow Peanut Butter Cookies
Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
14 tablespoons vegan non-hydrogenated      margarine
3/4 cup vegan granulated sugar or      turbinado sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons corn starch
2 cups vegan      chocolate chips
Peanut butter to      taste
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda; set aside. Combine margarine with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add salt, vanilla, and cornstarch mixed with one tablespoon water. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips and a good dollop of peanut butter. Drop tablespoon-sized balls      of dough about two inches apart on baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely.

Nestled between Adams, Leverett, Lowell and DeWolfe, Quincy is centrally located in the middle of the River Houses. Quincy has monumental House spirit, enthusiastic House Masters, a host of fun traditions, and some of the best housing on campus.
Dining Hall: Quincy has one of Harvard's most popular dining halls. As a result of its central location, acceptable food, and lenient dining restrictions, residents and non-residents alike flock to the dining hall for lunches and dinners. During peak hours, it can be difficult for residents to find a seat among the swarm of strangers. Community night every Thursday, however, allows Quincyites to enjoy a less crowded meal together. Throughout the afternoons and evenings, students gather in the dining hall for club meetings and less academic socializing, and the windows surrounding the dining hall allow for an appreciation of the setting sun that many other darkened dining halls fail to provide.
Common spaces: There are a variety of common spaces that are perfect for studying and hanging out. The Quincy Grille, which is open until 2 a.m. during the week and 4 a.m. on Saturday is a Quincy favorite. The mozzarella sticks from the Grille are delicious, and the grille offers occasional specialty burgers like "The Rancher"—a recent creation composed of a hamburger, crispy onion rings, bacon, and Tex-Mex cheese—all for only $6. Pair this with a ping-pong table and pool tables, and you've got the ultimate common space. To top it all off, the House also boasts of a pottery studio, a dance studio, and a gym.
Rooms: Sophomores are, for the most part, placed in Old Quincy, which means walkthroughs, small rooms, and the occasional unwanted rodent or cockroach. The housing greatly improves junior and senior year, however, when most residents move to New Quincy and enjoy singles and huge common rooms. Since New Quincy contains the dining hall and connects to the Qube—Quincy's House library—residents do not have to brave the cold winter weather to move around the House.
With the looming renovation of Old Quincy, housing will change as a portion of students are moved to temporary spaces around Cambridge. Although many of the details haven't been released, it's clear that renovations will drastically impact both rooming and House community.
House Spirit: Quincy residents can be spotted all around campus proudly wearing their personalized Quincy sweatshirts and exuding Quincy pride. To bring the House further together, there are events like Field Day, Quincy's Got Talent, and Assassins.
Location: As Quincy is in the middle of the River Houses, residents are equidistant from Eliot as they are to Mather, and getting to Emerson Hall takes five minutes. Despite being a River House, Quincy is not actually on the river, meaning that Quincy residents have views of Dewolfe or other Houses from their rooms instead of the beautiful Charles River.
Quirks: The Qube has a large comic book collection that can be viewed upon request. Other quirks include the old-fashioned dining booths next to the Grille—an easy and comfortable way for Quincy to show its superiority.
Rating: Because of its overcrowded dining hall and the poor views from rooms, this year Quincy House is ranked sixth of 12.

Fans of the television show "The Good Wife" may be excited to hear that Archie Panjabi, the Emmy award-winning actress for her role as private investigator Kalinda Sharma in the television show, is staying at Harvard as a Visiting Artist in Residence this Thursday and Friday.
You may also recognize Panjabi's name from her role in the 2002 film "Bend it Like Beckham" and later from her character in the 2005 film "The Constant Gardener."
Students will have the opportunity to hear Panjabi speak this Thursday at the New College Theatre Rehearsal Studio at 4 p.m as part of the Office for the Arts' Learning From Performers program, which promotes interaction between students and professional artists through workshops, classes, and discussions.
Panjabi will be interviewed in front of the audience by a panel of two Harvard students, and a reception at 5:30 p.m. will follow the discussion. The event is free to all students.
Sonia S. Dara '13, one of the moderators, says she is most excited to learn about Panjabi's acting career.
"I'm definitely looking forward to asking about how she got into acting—if that was one of her passions—and what her path to success has been," Dara said. "It would be really interesting to see how she went about doing that. And I'd want to know her future goals."

Tucked in a quiet corner between Winthrop and Kirkland, Eliot House might at first glance seem small (or perhaps just an extension of the Houses that flank it). Do not be mislead—Eliot offers a wealth of facilities, an exclusive spring formal, and prime real estate on the banks of the Charles River.
Dining Hall: The Eliot House dining experience is pleasant. Though some of those not lucky enough to live in Eliot might gripe about the dark wood-paneled interior, a wall of large windows lets the sunlight stream in quite nicely. During Sunday brunch students improve the ambiance by accompanying hot breakfast with live piano music. On the downside, the drink machines are located in the servery, and once the doors close, the drinks stop flowing. The dining hall staff are notoriously friendly (although non-Eliot residents should take note that they do enforce dining hall restrictions). Come good weather the food often moves outdoors, with courtyard barbeques throughout the fall and spring.
Facilities: Eliot offers its residents more than just a place to sleep and eat HUHDS food. With a wide range of easily accessible facilities, a favorite of the ever-hungry college student is perhaps Eliot's grille, also known as "The Inferno." The grille offers a delicious assortment of munchies, ranging from hamburgers and mozzarella sticks to milkshakes. The space is also well stocked with couches and a foosball table, making it a great place to hang out with friends. After all that fried food you might want to hit the gym, and while the MAC isn't that far, during the winter it can seem like quite the hike. Fortunately, the House gym is pretty well stocked.
For those looking for a creative outlet, Eliot House has its very own woodshop with weekly seminars, accessible to all who pass the safety test. The darkroom can be used for a yearly fee and students are welcome to use the dance studio and art studio freely as well. If you're more of a film buff there’s also the "Golden Arm," a mini movie theater space available for screenings. 
Rooms: Like most of the older river Houses, Eliot rooms can be a bit of a toss-up. Although the rooms aren't the best, Eliot does have decent party spaces, including the Octagon for sophomores, and the main party suite, "Ground Zero." The senior suites are also spacious and often have river views.
House spirit: Eliot seems to have a fairly tight community—tight enough, that is, to feel comfortable eating in their underwear together. For added House spirit hype, their stein clubs often have promotional videos. Keep in mind however that Eliot has just welcomed new House Masters, Natural Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton and educational consultant Gail O'Keefe. While they are no doubt up to the job, they have big shoes to fill and will be experiencing a steep learning curve alongside all of the House’s new residents.
Location: While Eliot is not the closest of the River Houses, it's still on the river. As an added perk, residents also enjoy access to the back gate on the corner of JFK Street and Memorial Drive (athletes rejoice!) but only until 7:30 p.m.
Quirks: Eliot has a few interesting traditions, one of which is the appearance of town criers at mealtime. Criers make various announcements in the dining hall, ending their speeches with the House toast, "Floreat Domus de Eliot." You should also try and spot the Eliot elephant hidden in the House architecture in four different places.
Rating: The Eliot House experience is generally a pleasant onem and Eliot is certainly a top House. However, with its House community in transition this year, Eliot is ranked fourth out of 12.

Pforzheimer House is in the Quad, but if you can get over its location, it really is one of the best Houses on campus. With its engaged House Masters, strong House life, and spacious rooms, if you get into Pfoho (and have a good pair of walking shoes), you're set up for a great three years.
Dining Hall: Pfoho has a unique two-story dining hall; downstairs there are larger tables and upstairs there are smaller, more intimate ones. There's even a love seat, which protrudes awkwardly above the dining hall and is often left unoccupied. Recently, Pfoho dining hall was decorated by YouTube sensation Vi Hart and you'll often find quirky decorations, which help make the modern, drab dining hall a little more exciting. If there's any objection to Pfoho dining hall, it's that it is too empty—there's little guarantee that your friends in the House will decide to eat in the Quad on any given day. In fact, every member of Pfoho is allowed to eat in Adams, which may account for the emptiness of Pfoho's own dining hall.
Facilities: Pfoho has its own grille, which you'll find in the Holmes Junior Common Room. The room has a huge television set, a ping-pong table, and a pool table. The one downside to many of Pfoho’s common spaces, particularly the library, is that they lack old-Harvard style charm. The Hastings Room, Senior Common Room, and Comstock Living Room try to make up the deficit in historical cachet, but you won't find many Pfoho residents using them.
Rooms: The rooms in Pfoho can be pretty pfucking clutch. While Pfoho cannot guarantee a single for everyone, like some of its Quad brethren, it comes pretty close. Sophomores, of course, get the worst rooms in the House, but even those rooms will not be walk-through doubles like those that can likely be found in your friend's River House suite. In Pfoho you have a range of buildings to pick from; you can live in Holmes, Comstock, Wolbach, Moors, or Jordan—the Quad's version of DeWolfe. Pfoho's biggest party suite is the Belltower, which holds 12 people.
House spirit: When your House Master shows up to class dressed as a polar bear (Pfoho's mascot), you know you're living in a House that overflows with spirit. Pfopen is known for its sometimes-heated exchanges and is one of the more active House lists on campus. The House also holds some of the more popular dining hall dances, including the '90s dance and Make It Rain.
Location: Far—what else is there to say? It's in the Quad. It can be annoying. Your friends won't want to visit you, but you'll get used to it. You'll learn the shuttle schedule, plan your walks back to the Quad with friends, and survive. Days that the shuttle doesn't run—including University holidays—and days when you just want to get home and the shuttle is filled with excited party-goers can become a bit annoying. Some of your favorite moments, however, may occur on the "party shuttle," and you may even make friends riding the shuttle one drab morning.
Quirks: Pfoho holds the Pforum where guest speakers are invited to speak about various topics and delicious food is served on a monthly basis. Even more quirky, though, is the newly-constructed Happy Room where Pfoho residents can relax on beach chairs and pretend for a moment that they're basking in the sun.
Rating: Pforzheimer is the best House in the Quad. It's got lots of House spirit, great suites, and abundance of wonderful common spaces. For this reason, Pforzheimer House has been rated fifth out of 12.
