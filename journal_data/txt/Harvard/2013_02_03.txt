After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
 
A$AP Rocky’s name has been on the lips of admirers and haters alike since he released his debut mixtape “LiveLoveA$AP” in 2011, and last month, the Harlem native further solidified his artistic persona with his debut album “Long.Live.A$AP.” The album is a celebration of the 24-year-old rapper’s versatility, paying homage not to the established greats of hip-hop, but to the young and novel voices popping up in the genre. Rocky places himself firmly at the fore of this wave of fresh faces, and while he does not have as compelling a message as others, his nimble verses make him worthy of a position of respect in modern hip-hop.
“Long.Live.A$AP” stands in stark contrast to other recent hip-hop releases, such as Kendrick Lamar’s “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” with its extreme stylistic range within the genre. Where Lamar mined one style of rap to its greatest depths, bringing forth emphatic themes through sincerity and intensity, Rocky sets out on a more gleeful exploratory expedition. The album experiments wildly with production techniques, swinging from a pensive, minimal soundscape crafted by Clams Casino on “LVL” to the frenetic, aggressively kinetic laser bursts of Skrillex on “Wild for the Night” and refusing to settle on single aesthetic framework.
Rocky showcases his fluidity on each track—he sounds totally at ease on every one as he traverses wildly disparate sonic environments. His wordplay and cadence never show a hint of strain, evident as he lists designers against the glistening production of “Fashion Killa”: “I see your Jil Sanders, your Oliver Peoples/ Costume National, Ann Demeuelemeester/ See Visvim be the sneaker, Lanvin or Balmain.” Then a mere two tracks later, he is railing, “Fuck them other niggas, I’ll ride for my niggas, I’ll die for my niggas” over a murky, oppressive, Odd Future-esque beat on “Jodye.”
As Rocky lays his verse alongside those of his peers Lamar, Joey Bada$$, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big K.R.I.T. on “1 Train,” he captures the sense of a classic posse track, with a crew of young rappers delivering their best over an unassuming beat. This track unintentionally highlights Rocky’s less-than-virtuosic rapping ability, though, as it places him next to Big K.R.I.T. As K.R.I.T spits, “Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin’ ships / Chokin’ niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with,” he manages to deliver the lines with equal ease and aggression, and he stays perfectly on beat as he delivers blow after blow to his haters. In comparison, Rocky’s delivery and wordplay sound lackluster, but he maintains interest with a healthy amount of attitude and flair.
The album ultimately suffers from A$AP Rocky’s post-rap ethos, which manifests as an overreliance on style. “Long.Live.A$AP” is rife with provocative ideas and gripping hooks, but these elements drift about without the proper fundamentals to anchor them. The songs never progress past innovative to become compelling, as Rocky’s entertaining but aimless lyrics meander around each track. A distorted, demonic voice chants ominously on “Pain,” adding a stirring dark dimension to the track, but it rings slightly hollow without more substantive songwriting from Rocky. The contrast between the sinister, disembodied voice and Rocky’s rapping is never utilized for any real purpose; it is a superficially appealing device and never builds to anything more.
There is no strong narrative arc tying the album’s many ideas together, but “Long.Live.A$AP” does not want for one. As 2 Chainz gleefully informs us, “I love bad bitches, that’s my fucking problem / and yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem” on “Fuckin’ Problems,” there can be no confusion as to whether or not the artists are enjoying themselves. What makes this album compelling is not inspired songwriting, but rather the bravado and spirit of the performers. Many of the tracks are quite simple thematically, and most fail to develop past their initial premise, but on tracks like “Fuckin’ Problems,” the listener cannot help but have fun as A$AP and company let loose with reckless abandon.
Rocky has more than enough panache to carry his first full-length album to success—”Long.Live.A$AP” stands as a testament to the young rapper’s flexibility and willingness to experiment musically. The tracks bounce from high to low energy at a rapid pace as Rocky skips effortlessly along on top of diverse beats on various tracks. What holds the album back is Rocky’s lack of lyrical structure and direction, as his writing lags behind his rapping and his thematic arc withers in the face of garish production. Rocky has put forth an album that serves as a good first step of a young artist, but leaves ample room for artistic growth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2013, at 9:20 p.m.
A charter bus carrying 42 passengers en route to the Philadelphia area crashed around 7:30 p.m. Saturday as it attempted to pass under the Western Avenue Bridge in the eastbound lanes of Soldiers Field Road. As many as 35 passengers, many of them high school students who had toured Harvard earlier in the day, were hospitalized with several sustaining serious injuries Saturday night, according to David Procopio, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts State Police.
Procopio wrote in a press release early Sunday morning that two seriously injured victims were still being treated at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, while another with life-threatening injuries was being treated at Boston Medical Center. Many of those with more minor injuries were released early Sunday morning, he wrote.
Seven passengers remained in Boston-area hospitals Sunday evening, according to Desiree Goodwin, an assistant librarian at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design who was with the group before and after the crash.
Discharged victims spent the night in donated rooms at the DoubleTree Suites hotel in Allston and returned to the Philadelphia area Sunday evening, Goodwin said.
Goodwin said she and others, including Harvard undergraduates, rallied late Saturday night to help find food, shelter, and transportation for the victims.
The students involved in the crash were traveling on a day trip with the Destined for a Dream Foundation, a nonprofit organization in  Bristol, Pa. that serves at-risk youth. The foundation puts together periodic day trips to visit college campuses around the country, exposing high school students who might otherwise rule out college to opportunities in higher education.
During their trip Saturday, students met with a representative of Harvard’s Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program at the College Admissions Office and took an official campus tour before having a group dinner at Uno Chicago Grill in Harvard Square.
The students came from various high schools in the Philadelphia area and in nearby Trenton, N.J., according to Goodwin. Erica Waller-Hill, the foundation’s founder, led the trip.
The crash likely occurred shortly after the group left the Harvard Square area, Goodwin said.
The collision badly damaged the bus, ripping off a large portion of the bus’s roof.
State Police first received a call about the accident at approximately 7:45 p.m., according to State Police trooper Reid Bagley. Dozens of firefighters rescued passengers from the wreckage, including four who had to be cut out of the bus. All passengers were rescued by 9 p.m.
Procopio wrote that due to its size, the bus should not have been on the stretch of road or tried to pass under the bridge, which has a 10-foot clearance. He added that “the driver will likely be cited for an overheight violation.”
Police have identified the driver of the charter as 66-year-old Samuel J. Jackson of Philadelphia.
The charter was operated by Calvary Coach, a small Phiadelphia-based charter service. The company’s owner Raymond Talmadge told Philadelphia’s NBC affiliate NBC 10 that Jackson was looking at a GPS device, not the road, as he approached the Western Avenue Bridge.
“He looked down, and when he looked back up, he saw a low bridge and he hit the low bridge,” Talmadge told the station.
Talmadge did not return multiple requests for comment Sunday.
Authorities later said they will also investigate how long Jackson had been at the wheel Saturday.
A collision reconstruction team began evaluating the damage to the bus after daybreak Sunday. State Police have also contacted the National Transportation Safety Board, which may join the investigation.
Police questioned Jackson and Talmadge Sunday and said they will not issue a citation or press charges until the investigation is complete, a process that is expected to take two to six weeks.
Soldiers Field Road and the Western Avenue Bridge were completely reopened early Sunday morning after the bus was lifted from the road.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever wondered what the differences between squash and tennis are? Fear not, The Crimson has got you covered. In this new series, The Back Page takes a look at some things you might not know about squash—and some reasons why you should check out some of the top teams in the nation, right here at the Murr Center.
5) Ball Warmers?
Yep, you read that correctly. Because of the rubber compound from which it is made, cold squash balls tend to “die” quickly due to a lack of bounce, while warmer balls bounce higher, allowing the ball to come up to be hit. Thus, especially for less experienced players who can’t hit the ball hard enough to achieve an optimal temperature, a ball warmer must be used. These handy devices are surprisingly easy to find—available for just $9.99 on eBay.
4) Listen for the Tin
 Unlike tennis, which has a net to stop play, a squash court is an open area for play. But on the front wall of a squash court, the bottom 18 inches, called the tin, acts like a net. Other than the serve, where the ball must go about the middle line on the front wall, every ball hit to the front wall must go above the 18-inch mark. If not, a clanking sound will indicate a point for the other player and a downed ball.
3) Lucky Eleven
 While 25 is the number to reach for volleyball, squash players search for the number 11 to light up the scoreboard, usually indicating the end of a game, where three won games clinch the match. Similar to a set of tennis, a player must be up by at least two points in a game order to call a victory. In an earlier shutout against Amherst, ninth-seeded Georgina Brinkley played to a 17-15 win of her second game.
2) A Lot on the Line
 Sure, squash shares many similarities to other racquet-swinging sports, but in one way, it bears more resemblance to basketball. In both sports, lines are important—so much so, that in tennis, there is a software solely designed to determine whether the ball did, in fact, touch the line. But where in tennis, the ball is considered ‘in’ if it touches any part of the white line, a squash ball that hits a line is considered out.
1) Squashing the Competition
 Although this fast-paced sport may make knowing when to clap a little confusing, be rest assured that the Murr Center will give you something to cheer about. The men’s team is No. 3 in the nation while the women’s team is ranked second overall, making it the only Crimson sport to possess two teams within the top three of the nation. If that isn’t enough to convince you to make the trek across the river, Harvard’s teams also hold the top-ranked individual players in the nation in Ali Farag and Amanda Sobhy, both of who have yet to lose a match this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cutting an early 11-point deficit to two at the half, the Harvard women’s basketball team rolled over Brown (7-11, 1-3 Ivy), 68-58, to sweep its first Ivy League road trip on Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center.
The Crimson (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) was bolstered by a combined 33 points off guard pair Christine Clark and Victoria Lippert and a near double-double from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds of her own.
After Bears forward Jordin Juker sunk two from the charity strip and put her team up, 28-17, with 8:08 to go in the first frame, Harvard junior Elise Gordon took a handoff from Clark and drove a layup that spurred a scoring effort which tied the contest at 33. The Crimson entered the locker room down by 2, 35-33.
Back on the floor in the second stanza, Lippert drilled an early three to give Harvard its first lead since the first minute of the game. Two jumpers from sophomore guard Ali Curtis put the Crimson on top, 40-37, with over 17 minutes to play. From there, Harvard would never trail again.
The final frame saw Fagbenle notch 10 of her points and six rebounds. The forward, who put up a career-high 20 points against Yale on Friday night, has been the team’s leading rebounder in eight of the last nine games.
The Crimson squad hit 12 free throws in a half where its lead was as large as 14 with under a minute remaining. The team’s final 11 points were entirely off of foul shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most non-athletes are gradually easing back into the swing of classes and schoolwork, winter-sport athletes have been on the grind and back in Boston for a while now. It’s getting down to the wire as some winter sports face some tough tests towards the end of their schedule. How have they been faring recently? How's on the rise and who's stock is falling? The Back Page will take a look at who’s hot and who’s not as we head into the critical final weeks of the winter season.
Onwards and Upwards:
Women’s Track and Field:
Freshman Martina Salander placed second at the Texas A&M Invitational, breaking a school record in the process. She became the first Crimson athlete to top the 4,000 point mark, placing in the top three in each event. In sprints, the 4x400 meter relay team, won the Terrier Invitational, topping a field of over 40 competitors.
Men’s Basketball:
While last Saturday’s contest against Dartmouth was certainly not the best game of the season for Harvard, during the final three minutes of regulation and the overtime period the Crimson were lights out, making up a thirteen point deficit to eventually win by five and remain undefeated in conference play. This weekend, the Crimson hosted Yale and Brown in an Ivy League double header and came away victorious in both contests, though not without some more overtime drama.
Hit or Miss:
Women’s Basketball:
After a three game winning streak to start the new year, the Crimson lost a league contest against Dartmouth. After a blowout win against the Big Green at home on January 12, Harvard travelled to Andover and lost in a low scoring affair. The Crimson failed to put up at least 60 points for the first time this season. But Harvard rebounded nicely with back-to-back road wins this weekend against Yale and Brown.
Women’s Hockey:
The Crimson had not lost in 14 games until Clarkson upset it 3-1 last weekend. However, the next day, Harvard bounced back, beating St. Lawrence 3-2 in overtime. The Crimson, who were previously ranked second in the country, dropped one spot to No. 3 in the standings. For the season, they boast an impressive 17-2-2 record, trailing only Minnesota and Boston College in the polls. On Friday, though, Harvard travelled to Dartmouth for a league contest, only to come away with a tie. It was a tough blow in their final contest before the Beanpot.
Stock Falling
Men’s Hockey: Facing myriad injuries, the Crimson, who started the season highly ranked, has lost six straight and ten of eleven. The potential is there, however, as shown by an overtime win against now No. 11 Boston University. But in their final tune-up before the Beanpot, Harvard was shut out, 3-0, by Rensselaer. They now face No. 5 Boston College on Monday. If the Crimson can pull of the upset, it will give the so far disappointing season a whole new flavor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of us are trying to pick spring classes and stay out of the cold, the Harvard ice hockey teams have different priorities. Facing off against BU, BC and Northeastern in the Beanpot next week, the men’s and women’s teams will look to prove that they are the dominant hockey force in Boston. The two week tournament is never an easy win, but it’s always worth watching. The Back Page breaks down some of the best Harvard Beanpot victories in recent memory.
 2005 Women’s Hockey Team Makes it Seven in a Row 
In its seventh straight Beanpot victory, the team cruised to a 6-1 victory over Boston College. The 6-1 win was the team’s 11th in a row for the 2004-2005 season. Although the Crimson started slowly, failing to make it on the board in the first 13 minutes, it quickly picked up steam after freshman Laura Brady found the net. Two minutes later, Harvard was up by two and didn’t slow down. The Eagle’s best look and only goal came during a 5-3 advantage.
 2012 Men’s Hockey Team Takes Home Third 
Although the team was shut out of the championship game, Harvard did not stop playing. Taking on the Huskies in the consolation game, the Crimson avoided coming in last place in the tournament with a 2-3 win over Northeastern. In a back-and-forth matchup, Harvard never gained a comfortable lead. Just seconds after the Crimson went up, 3-1, the Huskies responded, bringing them within one goal again. Harvard’s defense carried the team the rest of the way.
 1999 Women’s Hockey Dominates Boston College 
In a decisive 9-0 victory, the women’s hockey team proved itself once again to be the best in Boston. The Crimson only needed one to take the title, and co-captain A.J. Mleczko—who led the nation in scoring at the time—got it done early in the first period. Mleczko would go on to net two more in a hat trick. After finding goal only once in the first period—thanks to strong defense by Eagles’ goaltender Christy Nentwig—Harvard turned it on after the break and left Boston College in the dust.
 1993 Men’s Hockey Team Wins it All 
In Harvard’s most recent Beanpot championship win, the Crimson upset Boston University in a 4-2 victory. The Terriers entered the contest having won the last three tournaments—two over Harvard—and intent on adding a fourth title to the list. But Harvard was not content to let history repeat itself, and defied all expectations by seizing the lead early and never giving it up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite leading by 22 with 12:58 to play in the second half of its league contest against Brown, the Harvard men’s basketball team found itself all tied up at the end of regulation.
And while the Crimson eventually claimed a victory, 89-82, in thrilling fashion at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday, the double-overtime contest was not Harvard’s first surprising game against the Bears in recent memory.  Nor was it the first time co-captain Christian Webster helped spur his team to victory over Brown at home.
The senior converted two three-pointers in overtime, one in each period, including the go-ahead bucket with 4:38 to play in the second extra frame. From there, thanks to one layup apiece from rookie point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders along with four free throws, Harvard was at last able to hold its lead, closing the contest with a seven-point advantage.
“It was a little tighter than we’d like it to be, but we were able to pull out the victory,” said Saunders, who finished the game with a team-high 18 points. “Same thing as always, we got out early and let them back into the game.”
On Feb. 12, 2011, the eventual Ivy League co-champion Crimson team found itself down by 22 points against an underdog Bears team that had just two wins after its first eight Ivy contests. But after a second half in which Harvard outscored Brown by a whopping 54-25 margin, the Crimson was back on top, 85-78, by the game’s end.
Webster—who also played an instrumental role in Harvard’s recent comeback victory over Dartmouth—had a team-high 18 points and four treys in the second half of that contest.
“Christian makes some big shots for us all the time,” Saunders said. “He’s just been clutch for us this whole season. We look for him whenever we need a shot, and he’s been able to knock them down.”
GOING, GOING, GON
For the second time in his career, Chambers finished with a double-double Saturday night, contributing an impressive 17 points and 10 assists. But according to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the freshman’s defense on Brown guard Sean McGonagill was instrumental to the success of his Crimson squad.
“[Chambers’] defense was the key for us, that he was able to defend McGonagill so many times,” Amaker said. “He is very good and crafty, and for Siyani to stay in front of him as much as he did, to me, was the key to the game.”
Though McGonagill ended the contest with 20 points—including the game-tying bucket with one second remaining in regulation—Chambers and the Crimson kept his Bears’ counterpart out of the action for much of the game.
In the first half, McGonagill, who averages 14.7 points per game, was held to two points until just 5:41 remained in the period, during which time the junior converted a three-pointer and a layup to close out the half. Chambers led his team in scoring during the frame, chipping in 14 points.
McGonagill upped his point total to 20 in the second frame on four-of-six shooting but was unable to convert in the extra session. The guard recorded two assists but was held scoreless during the final 10 minutes of the extended game.
FOUL PLAY
Saturday night’s contest featured an inordinate number of free throw attempts, as the two teams exchanged hacks toward the hectic end of the contest. By the game’s end, the Bears had been whistled 23 times while the Crimson was called for 19 fouls of their own.
“I thought we played in poor position in the second half,” Amaker said. “Certainly they made some shots, but I thought our lack of discipline in fouling and putting them on the line was one of the bigger keys to the game.”
In the final two minutes of regulation, Harvard went to the line five times on non-shooting fouls. In overtime, the Crimson added nine more free throw attempts, as two Brown players—Rafael Maia and Cedric Kuakumensah—fouled out of the game.
Overall, the Crimson got to the line 27 times and walked away with19 points from the charity stripe, good for over 70 percent shooting. But down the stretch, the numbers got worse from the line for Harvard. Discounting a solid first half in which Harvard netted 10 of 11 free-throw attempts, the Crimson was 4-for-7 in the second half and 5-for-9 in overtime.
Sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi—who ended the game with nine points and as many rebounds—came away with five made foul shots despite attempting a game-high 11.
“Steve all day was tremendous for us,” Amaker said. “He was just aware of a lot of things, and that’s what we need our post players to be, aware and alert. I wish he would have been a little better from the foul line. It would have really capped off his individual performance.”
Brown was on the opposite trajectory from the line, hitting 14 of 16 free throws in the second half and beyond, including all four of its overtime attempts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After cutting an early 11-point deficit to two at the half, the Harvard women’s basketball team rolled over Brown (7-11, 1-3 Ivy), 68-58, to sweep its first Ivy League road trip on Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. The Crimson hadn’t beaten both Yale and Brown on the road in three years.
Harvard (12-6, 3-1 Ivy) was bolstered by a combined 33 points from backcourt pair Christine Clark and Victoria Lippert and a near double-double from sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who chipped in 14 points and nine rebounds of her own, in addition to collecting a team-high four steals. Fagbenle led the effort on the glass throughout the game, as no player from the Bears was able to grab more than four boards of their own.
“We can always count on [Fagbenle] to go out and give us the best game,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “It’s great playing with her. I love it.”
The first five minutes saw the two teams knot the score at 11 before a layup from Brown junior guard Lauren Clarke gave the Bears a lead they would hold until the 1:52 mark in the first half. Clarke was the leading scorer for the night, netting 20 points, including 12 from behind the arc on 50 percent three-point shooting.  Clarke was followed by guard Sophie Bikofsky as the only member of the team to break double digits in points scored, with 13 on the night.
Brown co-captain Sheila Dixon, the team’s second leading scorer at 11.9 points per contest, was held to just two points on 1-for-9 shooting. Overall, the Bears shot 19-for-53 from the floor, a 36 percent clip.
After Brown forward Jordin Juker sunk two from the charity strip and put her team up 28-17 with 8:08 to go in the first frame, Harvard junior Elise Gordon took a handoff from Clark and drove to the bucket for a layup that spurred a scoring effort, as senior Elle Hagedorn drilled a three to tie the score at 33.  The Crimson entered the locker room down by 2, 35-33, after a quick layup from Bikofsky put the Bears back on top.
Returning to the floor in the second stanza, Lippert sunk an early three to give Harvard its first lead since the first minute of the game. Two jumpers from Curtis put the Crimson on top, 40-37, with over 17 minutes to play. From there, Harvard would never trail again.
“I think people who were in the final minutes did a really good job defensively,” Curtis said. “We got good offense off of our defensive pressure. We picked up the pressure and put Brown back on their heels. I think that we just had the mentality of ‘we have to win this game, we’re not going to lose,’ and I think that those people coming into and out of the game were doing a great job of that.”
Fagbenle notched 10 of her points and six rebounds in the second half. The forward, who put up a career-high 20 points against Yale on Friday night, has been the team’s leading rebounder in eight of the last nine games.
The Crimson squad hit 12 free throws in a half where its lead was as large as 14 with under a minute remaining. The team’s final 11 points were entirely off of foul shots. Through the game, Harvard shot 14-for-21 from the charity stripe.
“Brown was down and they knew they had to foul,” Curtis said. “I think our team did a good job of taking care of the ball, being strong, allowing it to foul and knocking down the free throws. It comes down to the very end of the game. We practice free throws in practice, and that’s our job. We have to do that.”
It was another strong night for Harvard’s bench players. The four women who hit the floor off the bench combined for 15 points. The night before, at Yale, five non-starters pitched in 24 total.
“In practice we don’t really have the first string-second string,” Gordon said. “It’s the starters, and then everybody else is working just as hard too. As hard as you work, you’re making your teammates better too. We all make each other better in practice, and it only helps us to make us better in the games and on the court.”

Crimson wasn’t able to stem Crimson Tide as the Harvard men’s tennis team (2-2) fell to the University of Alabama (6-1), 4-1, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sunday. The loss followed the Crimson’s a 4-0 sweep of St. John’s (0-5) to open the day.
Co-captain Andy Nguyen captured the sole singles victory against the Crimson Tide and teamed up with freshman Nicky Hu at the No. 2 position to win the tiebreaker for the doubles point against the Red Storm.
St. John’s opened the afternoon with the pair of sophomore Mark Mozer and rookie Michael-John Every dispatching Harvard’s freshman Conor Haughey and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri, 8-6, in the No. 3 slot. Playing at No. 1, sophomore tandem Denis Nguyen and Alex Steinroeder responded by edging seniors Valentin Mihai and Mike Lampa, 9-8, with a 7-5 tiebreaker. The pressure was then on Nguyen and Hu to deliver to capture the doubles point for the Crimson.
“It was a really close match,” Hu said. “Early on in all three of the doubles matches we had, we got down early and it wasn’t looking very bright. Their teams were playing really well.”
Hu and Nguyen held on to defeat senior Vasko Mladenov and sophomore Hugo Morth, 9-8, with a 10-8 tiebreaker and take the opening point for Harvard.
“The last game of the match, we ended up winning that point on deuce,” Hu said. “It gave us a little bit of momentum going to the tiebreaker at seven-all. At tiebreak we saved a couple more match points, and Andy came up with a couple big shots that gave us momentum going into the tiebreak where we saved two or three match points, and they saved two or three match points before we finally won it.”
Starting singles play, No. 2 Shaun Chaudhari took his match with Mihai in straight sets, 6-0, 6-2, to give Harvard a 2-0 advantage.
“My main goal was playing consistent,” Chaudhari said. “Not really going for too much but just kind of playing my game and playing a solid match.”
The Crimson reached a 3-0 edge as No. 1 Denis Nguyen downed Mladenov, 6-3, 6-4. Harvard clinched the match with a win from freshman Kelvin Lam. While Lam easily took the first set, 6-1, Morth rallied to take the second, but Lam prevailed in the third, 7-6.
Harvard’s evening match-up proved more challenging. Alabama, which opened its day with a 5-2 victory over Cornell, jumped to an early lead in doubles play.
Tide junior Carlos Taborga and sophomore Philippe Tsangarides defeated Haughey and Lam at the No. 3 spot, 8-4. Their teammates, Jarryd Botha, ranked No. 79 in the country, and freshman Becker O’Shaughnessey, took down Denis Nguyen and Steinroeder, 8-5.
Alabama continued to dominate in singles.  The Tide opened with junior Daniil Proskura defeating Steinroeder at No. 3, 6-3, 6-3. Botha followed up with a win over Chaudhuri. While the first set stayed tight, the Tide senior dismantled Chaudhuri in the second, 6-3.
“It was a tough match,” Chaudhari said. “They’re a great team, and they all fought really hard. We just came up a little short that day.”
While Alabama led the match, 3-0, all was not lost for Harvard, as Andy Nguyen nearly blanked his opponent, sophomore David Vieyra, in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2. Nguyen was the only player from the Crimson to put up points against the Tide.
At the No. 1 position, Denis Nguyen battled O’Shaughnessey with the chance for Harvard to hold on in the contest and push it to six matches. Nguyen took the first set, 6-4, but was barely edged in the next two, 7-5, 7-6(2).
“Overall it was a good day for us,” Hu said. “We played the entire day very shorthanded. A lot of our team has been injured at the beginning of this season but for what we had we did really well…. Although we lost, we took something positive out of it because everybody fought really hard.“
Injuries, which have plagued the team for the whole season, are something Harvard hopes to avoid as it nears the start of Ivy League play.
“We were shorthanded,” Hu said. “Not because everyone is injured to the point where they can’t play, but to the point where we believe it’s not worth it to put people out there because they could seriously injure themselves. We know the most important time is going to be the Ivy League season, and when that comes around, we want everyone to be one hundred percent healthy and one hundred percent ready to take it.”

The Super Bowl is upon us, and, trust me, there is nothing super about being called out for knowing nothing about America's number one pastime. So to help you watch the funny commercials in peace, here is some advice on how to look like you understand the game.
 
1. Avoid Big Words 
Touch-down, first-down, nice play? The football lexicon can get kind of confusing. So to avoid utter embarrassment it is best to avoid technical terms when commenting on the game. I recommend the general grunt and howl. Instead of showing your ignorance by using actual English, try throwing your beer on the floor and yelling obscenities in foreign languages. If you do it right, people won’t know if you are cheering, booing, or experiencing a mild form of cardiac arrest. 
 
2. Change the Subject
At the risk of upsetting any real fans—or inviting any questions—don't root for a team. When people ask you who you are cheering for, nod enthusiastically and change the subject to the salsa selection. Did you try the artichoke dip? If there is no salsa selection leave the party. There is nothing keeping you there. 
 
3. Follow a Fan 
To look like you are paying attention, simply choose another fan and mimic everything she does the entire game. When he cheers, you cheer, when she cries, you cry, when he dips, you dip. Things might get awkward when you follow him into the bathroom, so just make sure to wash your hands. 
 
4. Memorize a Statistic 
Have an impressive statistic on hand so that if anyone talks to you, you have something to say. For example when someone asks you who you think will win or what you did over break try saying something along the lines of "In 2012 49er player Tarell Brown had one interception" or try this this gem, "Edgar Allen Poe wrote 'The Raven' in 1845."

Craving Cabot Café's cookies? You're in luck. The café is re-opening for the spring semester tonight at 9 pm.
"We have a lot of really exciting new changes," said Tian L. Kisch '15, the café's new marketing manager.
For one, the café will now offer soups for the first time. "A lot of our customers said they wanted something savory at night," said Kisch. Now, soup-lovers can enjoy chicken noodle and tomato basil after the items are unveiled at the official re-opening Sunday night.
The café is also adding a new drink, a honey latte called "The Queen Bee." New tea flavors are Moroccan mint, golden green tea, and vanilla rooibos. These were customers' top picks from the café's tea surveys, during which visitors had the chance to sample and evaluate a variety of teas.
The music playlist has been completely updated based on customers' song and artist suggestions, and all of the student art from last semester has been taken down and replaced with new student art.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: Feb. 3, 2013
An earlier version of this post incorrectly indicated that coffee cakes would be available at Cabot Café this spring. In fact, the menu item has been discontinued for this semester.

With the Super Bowl around the corner, Flyby brings you some key facts about the game that you can use to impress your friends and family as you gather 'round to watch America's biggest game.
The other Harbaugh… As the announcers will repeat over and over, the two coaches for the Ravens and the 49ers—Jim and John Harbaugh—were raised in the same household. However, a third Harbaugh, Jim's son Jay, is working as an assistant for his uncle and coaching in the Super Bowl against his dad.
Lots of chips… When you dip into that guacamole bowl at the big game, lean over and mention that it is one of 8 million that are consumed on Super Bowl Sunday. What goes with that guacamole? Well, nearly 15,000 tons of chips, of course.
Advertisements… Watching a bad commercial? While your friends are groaning at the bad punch line, drop in that a 30-second commercial at the Super Bowl costs nearly $3 million dollars. So much for cheap comedy.
 
Touchdowns... These are worth six points.
Beyoncé's half-time show... The show will be great. All 72,000+ fans will be waving blue "finger flashlights," one on each hand. That's almost 150,000 blue lights. Get ready.

On Sunday, millions of Americans took a break from their humdrum lives to tune into one of the biggest television events of the year, and possibly of the decade. Even Harvard managed to make an appearance, with professor Daniel T. Gilbert starring in a Super Bowl ad. But for those of you who somehow missed this momentous event, Flyby has recapped the 10 most phenomenal moments of the evening.
1. When Beyoncé’s silhouette first emerged out of fire and lights.
2. When Beyoncé took off her jacket to reveal an even more fabulous get up of black leather and lace.
3. When tens of Beyoncé holograms emerged, as if one wasn't already too much to handle.
4. When there was an exploding guitar.
5. When you realized that Beyoncé doesn't sweat.
6. When Beyoncé smized better than Tyra Banks ever could.
7. When crazy fans stroked Beyoncé's knee and you were jealous.
8. When Destiny's Child reunited and your 12-year-old self squealed in glee.
9. When Destiny's Child struck a perfect "Charlie's Angels" pose.
10. When Beyoncé's live voice was perfect.
Last week, during the Super Bowl press conference, Beyoncé said, "I will absolutely be singing live.... I am well-rehearsed. This is what I was born to do."
We couldn't agree more.
Oh, and apparently there was also a football game, but really we would rather watch Beyoncé dance with footballs.
