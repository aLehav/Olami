After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A survey of nearly 10,000 Harvard Business School alumni revealed a stark lack of confidence in America’s competitiveness in the global economy.
According to the survey, conducted by two HBS professors, 66 percent of the HBS alumni polled believe that the U.S. is falling behind emerging markets, while just 8 percent see it advancing.
HBS Dean Nitin Nohria and professors Michael E. Porter and Jan W. Rivkin, who led the survey, presented the findings at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday.
Respondents came from 49 states and 121 foreign countries, and more than a quarter of the alumni said that they hold a senior leadership position.
The survey asked whether these business leaders had been personally involved in relocation decisions within the past year. Of 1,767 alumni who had faced such situations, 57 percent were debating whether to move their business activities out of the U.S. Just 9 percent were mulling a relocation into the U.S.
The most common offshore locations considered were China, which 42 percent of those alumni said they had considered, and India, which 38 percent said they had considered. Brazil, Mexico, and Singapore were also frequently considered as new business destinations.
“The U.S. is losing out on business location decisions at an alarming rate,” Porter said in a press release. “However, the U.S. retains its core strengths in a number of important areas such as university education, innovation, and entrepreneurship, which means that we have the resources to reverse this trend.”
Respondents cited government regulation and taxes, as well as the cost of hiring workers in America and concerns about immigration issues, as factors that hindered their firms from creating jobs stateside.
“One of the most important aspects of this survey was its effort to pinpoint the roots of the country’s competitiveness problem,” Rivkin said in the press release. “This provides important insight for leaders who are seeking ways to boost America’s long-run prosperity.”
In a summary of the survey's results which was released online, Porter and Rivkin wrote, “A fundamentally weakened U.S. economy is not only an American problem but a global risk.”
Their survey is part of the Business School’s U.S. Competitiveness Project. Its results will be published in the Harvard Business Review in March along with data gathered by other researchers involved in the initiative who are analyzing factors that affect the nation’s competitive standing internationally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 21 at 3:15 p.m.
The Harvard University Library system will seek to reduce the size of its workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring process, according to a transcript of remarks made by Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton at one of three town hall meetings held Thursday.
“The new organizational design has not yet been approved, but it is certain that it will be different from the current one,” said Shenton at one of the town hall meetings. “A key change: the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
The University is considering both voluntary and involuntary options to reduce the staff size, but would prefer voluntary methods, Shenton said. While Harvard has laid off employees in the past, the University has at times also offered some staff voluntary early retirement packages or waited for attrition to reduce staff.
University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 told The Crimson in the fall that the goal of restructuring was increased efficiency.
“We are consolidating the libraries in a way that will save money, and that money saved will be plowed back into acquisitions and expanded services,” said Darnton told The Crimson at the time. “It will make the library much stronger.”
Prior to Thursday’s meetings, rumors and speculation circulated amongst library employees about the implications of the library restructuring.
“All of Harvard library staff have just effectively been fired,” read one tweet that circulated on Thursday after the first town hall had begun.
Others suggested that the restructuring would require that all library employees reapply to keep their current positions. The University strongly refuted this statement, but recommended that all employees file an Employee Profile “to state job preferences, to articulate skills and to provide a resume.”
Still, library officials left many other questions unanswered, according to Director of Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Bill Jaeger.
“There were vague references made to reductions in the size of the staff,” said Jaeger. “Despite persistent questions from the audience the [library] leaders were not able or willing to provide anything more specific than that.”
Though Jaeger said that he does not see the rationale for staff cuts, he recommended that the University employ “more enlightened” voluntary methods if staff is to be reduced.
“Our contract with the University requires union-management consultation when a department is considering [such changes],” said Jaeger. “We’re pretty confident that as this goes forward we’ll continue to hear from them.”
The staff reduction comes as part of a larger reorganization of library personnel that will be presented for approval next week to the Library Board, the body overseeing the library’s long-term transition. The Board will then be responsible for presenting the plan to University President Drew G. Faust.
Pending the plan’s acceptance, more detailed explanations of the organizational changes will be revealed during library staff meetings in February, according to a University statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For nearly two weeks, both Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Scott Brown have called for limitations on third-party spending in the upcoming Massachusetts Senate election. But though the two camps will sit down Friday to discuss the proposition, Harvard professors have called this temporary cease-fire a political stunt that will not have much influence on the race.
“This is for public consumption only,” said Harvard Kennedy School lecturer David C. King. “The Warren and Brown campaigns both understand that the first amendment allows this kind of speech by the Super PACs, so in trying to halt their influence, this is really about political posturing on an issue over which they have no control.”
The meeting comes after much back and forth on the issue of third-party advertisements as “super-PAC”-sponsored attack ads come under close scrutiny for their role in the presidential primaries.
In a series of letters and media statements, each campaign has offered increasingly specific proposals that would restrict the influence of organizations not affiliated with either campaign.
In a letter this week, Brown proposed a penalty that would fine a third-party group 50 percent of an advertisement’s cost each time it ran an ad in support of or attacking a specific campaign. The money, Brown wrote, could be given to a charity of the opposing campaign’s choosing.
“We want an agreement that actually means something,” Warren spokesperson Alethea Harvey wrote in an email. “We can’t force Super PACs to do anything, but our campaigns can agree on how we can respond if they don’t comply. We’re a lot stronger together than we are separately on this.”
Several professors pointed out that the significant amount of cash raised already by both campaigns has enabled them to take this political stance.
“They are both going to have so much money that the added value of having those extra resources values spent on their behalf is not much,” IOP Director Trey Grayson’94 said.
But professors pointed out the candidates have little real clout in light of recent changes in third-party finance law. In the 2010 Citizens United case, the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot impose limits on the political spending of independent groups. Citizens United also stipulated that candidates may not have any affiliation with super-PACs.
Even if the two campaigns settle on an agreement, the candidates would have no ability to enforce it, professors said.
“The whole point of Super PACs [is] on premise that the financial entity is independent of the campaigns. So they can put out nice lines about how they would like to have out of, but they have no control over it by definition,” said Kennedy School professor Benjamin W. Heineman Jr. ’65.
For all the time and attention being given to the proposal, even if it is just political posturing, the effort may not even be very important to voters, Grayson said.
“I’m not convinced that the public cares too much about this,” he added. “The economy is what a lot of voters care about. These sort of clean election issues are things that political junkies and editorial boards care about but average voters don’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Occupy movement that swept the nation this past fall made history, some say—but at Harvard, according to a local commission, the demonstrators should have had a permit if they wanted to park their protest on historic ground.
The Cambridge Historical Commission, a city department that oversees significant sites in Cambridge including Harvard Yard, notified Harvard administrators last week that the long-term presence of a weather-proof dome erected by Occupy Harvard protesters violated a city code.
The Historical Commission sent a letter informing the University that a permit is required to erect any permanent structure in a historic district. Harvard is responsible, the letter stated, for making sure that groups acting on University property—even one like Occupy Harvard that protests the University’s policies—adhere to local regulations.
Occupy Harvard protesters said they were unaware of the permitting regulation before the commission sent its letter to Harvard.
Although Occupy Harvard first pitched its tents in early November and set up the geodesic dome less than three weeks later, the commission did not consider it necessary to inform Harvard of the permitting rule until recently. When members of the department first saw the dome, they believed it would be temporary, according to Charles Sullivan, the commission’s executive director.
But the dome proved to have more staying power than the Historical Commission estimated. “When it was still there over the holidays, we felt it was important to bring Harvard’s attention to the fact that Harvard Yard is a historic district,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan said that the letter was not intended to disrupt the Occupy protest, adding that the commission would be “happy to issue temporary permits” if applicants follow proper procedures to seek such accommodations.
As of now, however, the dome is no more. Harvard officials removed it from the Yard on the same day that they received the Historical Commission’s letter. Administrators say that the letter did not motivate them to seize the dome; rather, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal, the University grew concerned for pedestrians’ safety after high winds caused the structure to move several feet across the Yard earlier that day.
On the Occupy Harvard website, protesters complained that the University’s removal of their dome and information tent impinged on their right to free speech on campus but vowed to continue their activism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Recently we released the first-round winners on the male side of the bracket, and earlier today, we revealed the winner of the matchup between Josue Ortiz and  Keith Wright. Now, we take a look at our second men’s semifinal: football’s Collier Winters against rowing phenom Andrew Campbell.
Check back all this week as we go through our selections.
Collier Winters v. Andrew Campbell
Without question, senior quarterback Collier Winters had a huge 2011, making the All-Ivy second team despite missing forty percent of his team’s games and beating Yale for the third straight year.  Yet as dominant as he was in that latter half of the season, there was a point in the year where it wasn't clear that he was the best quarterback on his own team.
Sophomore Andrew Campbell, by contrast, is the top lightweight sculler in the country and one of the best in the world.
While Winters guided Harvard to five of its seven Ancient Eight victories, the Crimson earned two of them with junior Colton Chapple under center. And though Harvard's perfect record in Ivy play largely overshadowed it, Winters struggled in the season opener against Holy Cross, going 25-for-41 and throwing two touchdowns and as many interceptions. Without that loss, the 9-1 Crimson would probably have gone down as one of the one or two best Harvard teams of the modern era.
Campbell on the other hand didn't have any substandard races—his fourth place finish in the World Rowing Championships was the only time all year he failed to medal in a sculling event.
Winters' accomplishments may be better known by many of the Crimson faithful, but they simply aren't on the same level as Campbell's.
Winner: Andrew Campbell

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of its most dominating performances so far this season, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team handled Brown from start to finish, earning a 206-80 victory on Thursday afternoon at Blodgett Pool.
Once the Crimson (4-0) jumped into the pool for the first time in the new year, it never looked back, earning its third consecutive Ivy victory in wire-to-wire fashion. Harvard won 14 out of 16 of the events on the day, including the first nine.
“I think it went well for us,” sophomore Willy Brophy said. “We’re in a strange spot in training because, though we just came off our training trip, we already have some big meets coming up. But I think the team pulled together, and we came out of the meet just fine.”
Freshman Mike Gaudiani agreed with Brophy’s sentiments, emphasizing the importance of the team’s training trip in Puerto Rico to its current successes.
“We definitely worked very hard at the training trip,” Gaudiani said. “Coming off of that that, swimming so well at a meet like this definitely signals that we are in pretty good shape and is a pretty good indicator as well for how well we are doing thus far in the season.”
The afternoon began with the 200-yard medley relay in which the Crimson “A” team, composed of sophomore Jack Pretto, freshmen Chuck Katis and Griffin Schumacher, and junior Greg Roop, took first place at 1:32.24. The Harvard “B” team finished second, coming in at 1:35.05.
The next race, the 1000-yard freestyle, featured a win by freshman Reed Snyder at a time of 9:41.51. It was the first collegiate victory for the rookie in the 1000-free.
Classmate Gaudiani continued the rookie winning streak when he cruised into first in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:42.15.
“I think I did pretty well,” Gaudiani said. “I was swimming in some of my off events, but I managed to put up some pretty good times for this point of the season, so I was pretty happy with that aspect of my races today.”
By the end of the first nine events, two more freshmen came out on top: Katis and Kyle McIntee. The former gained his second win of the night in the 100-yard breaststroke, whereas the latter won in the 200-yard butterfly, coming in with times of 56.38 and 1:51.52, respectively.
Not to be outshone, the Crimson sophomores also added two more victories, all before the Bears (0-4) managed to nab a first-place finish. In the 50-yard freestyle, Chris Satterthwaite won with a meet-best 21.16. But Satterthwaite’s win was a close one, as classmates Oliver Lee and Brophy were within three hundredths of a second.
The next sophomore win came from Brophy, who clocked in at 46.54 in the 100-yard freestyle.
“I got up and just raced, not worrying about times or any of that.” Brophy said. “I just wanted to get some good racing in and have fun with it. I usually swim better when I’m just trying to have fun instead of concentrating on times, and I think I definitely showed that.”
Rounding out Crimson victories in the first nine events, senior Rob Newell won the 100-yard backstroke in 51.40 seconds, and junior Michael Stanton came out on top in the 30-meter dive with 364.06 points. In that event, the top four highest scorers were all wearing Harvard colors.
It was only then that Brown clinched a race win. In the 200-yard backstroke, Bears freshman Alex Pascal grabbed first with a time of 1:57.60.
After Pascal’s victory, it was back to the Crimson highlight reel. Sophomore Jason Ting took the 200-yard breaststroke in dominating fashion, coming in over 2.5 seconds ahead of the next swimmer. In the next event, the 500-yard freestyle, it was sophomore Spenser Goodman who put in the winning time at 4:44.02. Goodman’s mark was over four seconds ahead of the next closest competitor and over 10 seconds ahead of the nearest Brown swimmer.
In the 100-yard butterfly, Newell, at 51.28, pulled out his second individual win of the night. The senior’s race was followed by freshman Mike Mosca’s victory at the one-meter dive with a score of 347.93 points.
Katis then followed his teammate’s lead and won yet another event, his third of the meet. This time it was the 400-yard IM, and his time of 3:57.77 led the three Crimson swimmers who placed in that race’s top three.
It was only in the final event of the night that Brown once again grabbed a first-place win. Clocking in a time of 3:10.67, Brown’s “A” Team won the 400-yard relay.
But the Bears’ fate had already been sealed by that point. The loss marked Brown’s worst defeat of the season thus far.
“I think our team is pretty focused right now,” Brophy said. “We are honing in on wrapping up our dual meet season well and going into Ivies focused and united as a team. From here we want to go up and win the Princeton and Yale meet and Ivies; whatever that requires we are ready and willing to do.”

Prior to this week, I had never brushed my teeth eight times in one day. But then again, I'd never commanded children to spit in my general direction.
For the past few days, I have been working at the medical clinic we set up in Galeras, Honduras with the Global Medical Brigades. I have shadowed doctors, seen teeth extracted, and learned how to spell "acetaminophen." Today, however, I am teaching the children's charla (chat). The subject matter? Dental hygiene.
The problem? I don't speak Spanish. Over the past few days, I have miraculously picked up enough to understand everything said to me, but not enough to respond with anything more than "Si!" and helpless facial expressions. As a result, I serve as a voiceless model, exaggeratedly gesticulating with my toothbrush as my fellow teachers call out directions that I occasionally misinterpret, much to the confusion of the children. Izquierda, derecha, arriba, abajo! Left, right, up, down! En circulos! In circles! 
When they finish, toothpaste lather and saliva dribbling from their chins, I grab a garbage bag and demonstrate the last step and latest addition to my vocabulary: "Y escupa!" ("And spit!") Ten children then proceed to take turns spitting into the bag, with varying degrees of success. Whatever doesn't quite make it into the bag finds its way onto me.
After making sure that no spit has been left behind, we say an enthusiastic "Muchas gracias!" and send the children on their way. The ninth charla group of ten children files in. I squeeze out a fresh spurt of toothpaste, remind myself that izquierda means left, and begin again.
