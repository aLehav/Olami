Adapted from his audio drama of the same name, “When You Finish Saving the World” marks actor Jesse Eisenberg’s directorial debut. The film, which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 20, features Julianne Moore and Finn Wolfhard as Evelyn and Ziggy, a mother and son duo who struggle to relate to each other. The screen adaptation is an arresting examination of the nuances of family dynamics — the intertwining feelings of frustration, affection, and isolation that can complicate our closest relationships. Eisenberg crafts a deftly written narrative that carefully weaves together the lighthearted and the profound, which Moore and Wolfhard vitalize with their palpable chemistry.
Shot on 16 mm film, “When You Finish Saving the World” maintains a striking sense of intimacy through its graininess as we follow its protagonists through suburban Indiana. Evelyn works at a shelter for survivors of domestic abuse, and teenage Ziggy has found moderate success performing folk-rock songs he writes on an online platform where he’s accumulated no less than 20,000 followers across the globe — a statistic he brings up often. Neither mother nor son is particularly interested in what the other is passionate about, and they both maintain a disinterested, cold exterior around each other. Both Moore and Wolfhard master the subtleties of this dynamic, Evelyn with her dry, reserved quips and Ziggy with his obnoxious, arrogant adolescent behavior. They embody two indubitably selfish characters, and yet Eisenberg allows us to care for them more and more as the story progresses and he gradually exposes their interiority — their insecurities, their yearnings, and, ultimately, their glaring similarities.
While Evelyn becomes fixated on helping Kyle (Billy Bryk), a 17-year-old boy living at her shelter who she sees as everything her son isn’t, Ziggy is intent on impressing a classmate named Lila (Alisha Boe) who’s passionate about social justice issues. In bringing to life the clueless yet somehow charmingly earnest Ziggy, Wolfhard sensitively and humorously portrays the awkwardness and emotional volatility of adolescence. His facial expressions alone are effective in conveying his contempt or cluelessness. In one scene, Ziggy yells at his mother through the bathroom door as she showers, demanding, “Mom, did you try to open the door while I was live streaming?” Contrasting these belligerent moments are interactions steeped in sincerity, like when Ziggy composes music to accompany a poem Lila wrote and nervously performs the song for her. He’s almost innocent in his naïveté, and his admiration for her is endearing: “The way people talk about shit they just want to buy, you talk about the world,” he tells her in awe. Lila, who Alisha Boe portrays as self-possessed yet grounded, can easily see through his feigned interest in what he vaguely refers to as “political” topics.
Moore, on the other hand, is all careful restraint, with her measured tone and neutral facial expressions. Her relationship with Kyle, who she desperately wants to help get into college despite his apathy toward it, is one of the most compelling yet ambiguous parts of the film. Why she becomes almost obsessed with helping him is never entirely explained, but their relationship offers thought-provoking commentary on familial ties. What if your son — or your mother — isn’t who you’d like them to be, and you’d prefer to replace them with someone else? Evelyn’s determination to mold Kyle’s future into what she believes is best for him is indicative of both her fraught relationship with her own son and the privilege that fosters her self-absorption.
In a sparse 84 minute runtime, Eisenberg isn’t afraid to confront a wide range of pertinent issues — from the complexities of escaping domestic abuse to the commodification of art to the condescension of white liberals. He maintains both breadth and depth throughout and handles these topics with the nuance they deserve; the screenplay blends together just enough thoughtful dialogue and just enough satire to provide effective social commentary. In his debut, Eisenberg demonstrates a clear directorial vision with careful shot framings providing us with a sense of closeness to this dysfunctional yet relatable family.
Ultimately, “When You Finish Saving the World” is a biting criticism of hypocrisy and narcissism; both Evelyn and Ziggy have noble visions of helping others through their respective pursuits, yet at home they treat each other with cruelty and disdain. Still, Eisenberg doesn’t let us believe they are incapable of changing, and this is what makes the film so rewarding. When Evelyn and Ziggy “finish saving the world,” perhaps they’ll realize they never lived on the same planet in the first place — but their orbits might grow a little closer nonetheless.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mariama Diallo’s directorial debut “Master” takes place at the fictional Ancaster University, a New England college so elite that FDR was rejected and had to attend his safety school — Harvard. Ancaster’s campus also just so happens to be haunted by Salem-era witches, the inspiration for eerie legends passed down from class to class. Diallo’s psychological horror combines the sensibilities of “Dear White People” and “Get Out,” following three Black women in their journeys at the exclusive university: Gail (Regina Hall), a newly promoted “house master” of a dorm; Jasmine (Zoe Renee), a wide-eyed freshman; and Liv (Amber Gray), a professor. In presenting their stories, the film provides a haunting critique of historically racist institutions like Ancaster and their resistance to change. While the script of “Master” leaves one too many threads untied to match the cultural resonance of thematically similar films like “Get Out,” it is nevertheless an eerily moving story that reveals the psychological toll of racism, and meditates on what it means to be Black and truly belong in America.
While Jasmine navigates her freshman year, Gail begins her new position as the first Black house master at Ancaster (a real honorific that has only recently been retired from Harvard), and Liv undergoes consideration for tenure. At a school with very few people of color, the myriad microaggressions they face are portrayed with poignant authenticity. Subtly racist interactions are woven into the characters’ everyday experiences so that they become normal, expected, but nevertheless painful. Jasmine’s bag is searched at the library, and on another occasion, a note is left for her in the bathroom calling her hair “disgusting.” Gail is jokingly called “Barack” by her white colleagues as they congratulate her on her new job. As demonstrated through these day-to-day interactions, the film is consistently attuned to the lived realities of Black women in predominantly white spaces. In telling the story through the eyes of both students and faculty members, Diallo truthfully conveys how Black women face discrimination no matter their age or status.
From the very beginning of the film, Jasmine and Gail begin to experience unnerving phenomena on campus. Jasmine has been assigned to a dorm room that’s said to be haunted by a witch, and Gail notices strange occurrences and historic relics in the attic of the home she lives in as house master. Especially in the beginning of the film, Diallo does an excellent job setting a sinister tone, contrasting the hope of new beginnings with the threat of the school’s frightening past and present horrors. She makes careful use of shadows, casting the mundane in the macabre; soft red lighting is used to create an eerie, off-putting aesthetic in the dorm. Normal college experiences become uncomfortable for Jasmine as she repeatedly finds herself to be one of the only Black girls in the room. A party scene at a frat exemplifies how Diallo effectively communicates this discomfort; as the white students surrounding Jasmine begin to rap along to crowd-pleaser “Mo Bamba,” dropping the n-word without a second thought, she begins to feel claustrophobic and anxious.
The stakes increase for the protagonists as it is slowly revealed how Black women have historically been targeted at this university. Hall, Gray, and Renee are all convincing as they embody the fear and anger that goes along with trying to survive at an institution that devalues and threatens their existence. Jasmine has a particularly emotional arc as she faces increasingly horrific instances of racial terror, which Renee brings to life with a touching vulnerability.
In spite of its powerful messaging about the insidious nature of institutional racism, “Master” doesn’t quite tie all of its storylines together in a satisfying way. Though it’s indeed compelling to use the supernatural to exacerbate the real life horrors of racism, Diallo never quite makes clear how the presence of witches on campus relates to the protagonists’ actual experiences with racism. Such ambiguities make for stirring conversation, but there are ultimately too many questions left unanswered to deliver a cohesive view of how the supernatural represents white supremacy. Moreover, while it’s heartening to see the stories of three Black women centered in “Master,” it would have been all the more empowering to see them maintain a sense of agency as the story unfolds. All three protagonists would have benefitted from greater character development, more detailed backstories, and some sort of hope they (and their audience) could cling to. Though their experiences are certainly realistic in many ways, it is also disenchanting to see the characters rendered powerless against a visibly broken system.
“Master” is not without its flaws, but it is nonetheless an intelligently examined portrayal of the racial dynamics at historically exclusive, predominantly white institutions — ones that too often try to present themselves as champions of diversity in the present day. The film has all the components of a powerful social thriller; it just needed those pieces to fit together more cohesively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of the plot of “892” unfolds in a series of phone calls. Honorably discharged former U.S. Marine Brian Brown-Easley (John Boyega, in a tour de force performance) has walked into an Atlanta-area Wells Fargo, claiming he has a bomb in his backpack. In one of the film’s most taut phone exchanges, Brian is demanding that he speak to a hostage negotiator. On the other end of the line, they tell him to hold on. “I’ve been holding on,” he says, frustration bubbling out of his polite demeanor. “I’ve held on.”
“892” portrays Brian Brown-Easley as a man who held on until he felt he had no other option. The film is a tense, devastating retelling of the real-life Brown-Easley’s fatal final day in 2017, when he barricaded himself and two hostages in the bank — not to rob it, but to draw attention to the $892.34 disability check that the Department of Veterans Affairs had unjustly withheld from him. In the steady hands of first-time feature director Abi Damaris Corbin and writers Corbin and Kwame Kwei-Armah, “892” shines a compassionate light on Brown-Easley, bringing the almost Shakespearean tragedy to life onscreen with quietly effective acting and tremendous camera work.
The movie begins with Brian the night before he has resolved to hold up the bank. His anguish is already apparent as he runs out of phone credit to keep talking to his young daughter Kiah (an adorable London Covington) and makes preparations in the run-down Travel Inn where he is living. Once in the bank, the mild-mannered Brian continually apologizes to his hostages, his escalating panic beating through his grey sweatshirt. Boyega keeps Brian’s pain at the forefront, even as law enforcement, the press, and the public slowly gather outside the bank and his anxiety hardens at points into quiet resolve.
While Boyega carries much of the film’s immense emotional weight in his clenched shoulders and close-up, expressive face alone, he is buoyed at every turn by outstanding supporting performances. Connie Britton makes a somewhat surprising cameo as an empathetic local news producer whom Brian calls and speaks with at length about his story. And as the two bank employees who remain trapped with Brian until the end, Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie hit pitch-perfect notes of fear tinged with compassion for Brian as they watch him unravel and begin to understand his demands.
The scenes inside the bank have a theatrical quality — a three-person play comes to mind as the camera tracks Brian, Rosa Diaz (Leyva), and Estel Valerie (Beharie)’s movements around the bank and each other, often capturing the women’s watchful gaze in the background while Brian is on the phone with his family or the hostage negotiator. From the moment bank manager Estel realizes what Brian is about to do and begins ushering the rest of the bank’s customers out the door, Beharie in particular is hard to look away from.
“892” also holds the poignant honor of featuring the late, great Michael K. Williams’ final screen performance as chief hostage negotiator Sargeant Eli Bernard, who bonds with Brown over their shared Marine background and connects with Brian’s ex-wife Cassandra (Olivia Washington) over FaceTime to update her on the situation. Williams brings gravitas and urgency to the scenes outside the bank and his subtly devastating performance prevents the film’s third act from losing steam.
“892” could be marketed as a thriller. But despite the film’s taut editing and unrelentingly intense tone, there is very little suspense. Brian makes it clear from the outset that he does not expect to live through the day, and he seems to have no intention of actually harming his hostages. As such, the genre beats of the heist/hostage negotiation play out with more emotional tension than anything else, unfolding like a prolonged, telegraphed denouement of Brown-Easley’s life and the unjust hand he was dealt.
While the filmmakers take care to mention that Brown-Easley did indeed struggle with mental illness — on the phone, Cassandra asks if he has taken his meds — it staunchly refuses to suggest that his actions were the result of his neurodivergence rather than a justified response to unjust circumstances.
Indeed, the film takes direct aim at the bureaucratic wrongdoings of the Veteran Affairs Department, which withheld the real Brown-Easley’s disability check for $892.34 on erroneous grounds. But the simmering indictment of “892” goes beyond one federal agency, painting a portrait of a society whose failure to do right by those who fought for it is a symptom of its structurally racist, unfeeling systems rather than an isolated problem.
At one point in the film, Brian remarks that a man who previously tried to rob the same Wells Fargo branch and was arrested, not killed, must have been white; Estel and Rosa say nothing in tacit agreement. Outside the bank, Williams conveys Sargeant Bernard’s indignance at the moments of disrespect toward him by white fellow officers despite his position of authority. And flashbacks show a VA employee (Miriam Silverman) tentatively offering Brian a callous pamphlet on “Homelessness and You” when he expresses that he will lose his housing without his disability check, and then Brian’s violent arrest in the waiting room when he refuses to leave.
Film adaptations of tragic true stories can run the risk of heavy-handedness, or oversentimentality. But ultimately, “892” is unsparing and sincere — and, like Brian’s story itself, worthy of a wide audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An abortion drama with a sense of humor: This is the elevator pitch for “Call Jane.” Set in the tremulous historical moment of 1968, the film is a talky, fictionalized account of the real Chicago-area underground abortion network called the Jane Collective. The tonal balancing act is tricky — but despite major shortcomings, it mostly makes for an entertaining, impassioned piece of filmmaking.
“Call Jane” enters its thematic milieu by way of Joy (Elizabeth Banks), a pregnant, cheerful, albeit listless suburban housewife. Her well-appointed life is rounded out by a doting but oblivious husband (Chris Messina), a criminal litigator whose briefs she helps write, and an (implausibly) affectionate teenage daughter (Grace Edwards).
When Joy develops life-threatening cardiomyopathy in her first trimester, the all-male hospital board votes unanimously not to approve her petition for a “therapeutic termination.” The weighty subject matter hits heaviest during this first act of the film, as the white, wealthy Joy struggles to obtain an abortion and considers every dangerous option. Ultimately, she finds a simple flyer reading “Call Jane,” and makes the titular call to the women that will save her life.
Director Phyllis Nagy — best known as a playwright and for her work on the Oscar-nominated screenplay of the iconic 2015 lesbian drama “Carol” — deftly conveys the anxiety and disorientation of Joy’s journey with her sharp sense for pacing. After moving briskly through the setup, Nagy renders Joy’s abortion, somewhat radically, in painstaking, uncomfortable detail, as the doctor explains each step to his patient with a series of glinting surgical tools in his hands. Throughout the film, Banks plays Joy with just enough gravity to cut through the lighthearted tone of the film and convey the life-or-death stakes on her face. With its outstanding delivery, this scene alone catapults Banks into the 2022 awards conversation.
After the procedure, Joy becomes embedded, reluctantly at first, in the group of women operating the service, led by lifelong activist Virginia (a chain-smoking, chair-straddling Sigourney Weaver). Banks gets steelier over the course of the movie, tracking a convincing transformation from the shaking patient on the doctor’s table to the whiskey-drinking hardballer demanding that the doctor teach her the very same procedure he had performed on her in the earlier scene.
The performances, Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi’s buoyant script, and upbeat catharsis make “Call Jane” worth a watch. But its political reflection is distinctly that of the white feminism associated with the second-wave women’s liberation movement. A hard-hitting critique of racial reproductive justice it is not.
The character of Joy is based loosely on real-life figures who were involved with the Jane Collective. Though a case can be made for pointing out that even privileged women like Joy — who observed the political uprisings of 1968 from behind picket fences — suffered from restricted access to abortion and rallied to the cause, the choice of focal point raises the question of its own necessity, and results in an obviously simplified representation of underground abortion access in a pre- (and increasingly likely post-) Roe v. Wade world.
The movie never overcomes this structural myopia. In one scene, Gwen (Wunmi Mosaku, pitch-perfect throughout despite not having much to do), the sole Black woman in the network leadership, calls the group to task for class-based racial disparities in the women they serve and critiques Virginia for screwing up partnerships with the Black Panthers and the Black Feminists alliance. Despite Mosaku’s strong delivery, it is impossible not to feel like the movie is checking a box. Gwen’s concerns unfold as a B-plot relative to Joy’s, and they are not directly addressed again.
Instead, the film treats its inherent intersectional complexities in passing and hews closely to Joy as she finds new purpose in her days, setting off on a somewhat predictable upper-class women’s-lib arc of self-discovery. Many of the humorous setpieces come from this plot, as Joy gets high for the first time and devours an enormous sandwich or tries to explore her own vagina and gets interrupted in the bathroom by her daughter.
The production itself is impeccably well-executed in both its period and character-based specificity, channeling a late ‘60s moment when the housewives wore sneakers and talked about the Yippies while sipping their afternoon cocktails. The costuming, helmed by Julie Weiss and rich with period detail, shines. Banks’ creamy turtlenecks, tailored pants, and coiffed blonde hair gradually loosen over the course of the movie as she takes on more responsibility with the collective. The music, both diegetic and scored, is also pure time-capsule fun, if not a bit overly reliant on cheeky needle drops. To wit: “What’s Goin’ on Down There” by activist folk singer Malvina Reynolds plays just as Joy peeks down at her strategically placed hand mirror.
Beyond its unconvincing politics, “Call Jane” also vexes the viewer on some less consequential points. Joy’s teenage daughter, who has ostensibly just gotten her first period, looks at least 25 to an extent that proves distracting. The usually flinty Kate Mara is misused in the film as a recently widowed fellow housewife whose motives and purpose in the plot are unclear. At moments, the film feints to portray her as an antagonist, but then shies away: The tone emerges as simply too rosy to account for legible malice.
Indeed, the main villain in “Call Jane” is the patriarchy, and white women the heroes. It’s an important story, told entertainingly. Still, in our foreboding current moment with state crackdowns on legal abortion and Roe v. Wade in jeopardy, it seems dubious whether the film merits a laudatory citation as part of Sundance’s politically relevant slate.
