After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—The clock has struck midnight for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
The 14th-seeded Cinderella was overmatched physically and talent-wise on both sides of the ball by sixth-seeded Arizona, which cruised to a 74-51 victory in the NCAA Tournament’s third round on Saturday night.
Coming into the contest, Harvard had not shot worse than 36.7 percent from the field in a game all season—and that was in a victory, on Dec. 29 against Cal.
But the Wildcats swarmed the paint and locked down the Crimson’s three-point shooters all night, as Harvard shot just 27.6 percent.
Harvard’s top two scorers from Thursday night’s victory over New Mexico—sophomore wing Wesley Saunders and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard—were just two for 17 combined.
Saunders, the team’s best finisher, was held to single digits in scoring for the first time all season. The sophomore failed to convert over and over again on Saturday, as numerous shots rimmed out while the Wildcat big men contested nearly everything.
“They’re [tall] around the rim, and...[it] made it difficult to finish,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
Meanwhile, Rivard—who entered the contest having shot 11 for 16 from three in two career tournament games—was a focal point of the Arizona defense from the start. The Wildcats limited the sharpshooter to just one-for-six shooting from downtown.
“They locked down on him,” Amaker said. “There was a point of emphasis for their team not to lose him, not to be able to find him in transition.... They did an outstanding job of guarding our shooters from the perimeter.”
After watching the Crimson’s game against the Lobos, Wildcats coach Sean Miller designed a defense he felt would specifically contain Rivard, using perimeter players to defend him rather than a power forward, as New Mexico had.
“A lot of people guarded him with their four-man, and that pick and pop was killing [them],” Arizona guard Mark Lyons said. “So, Jordin [Mayes] and Nick [Johnson], we put them on [Rivard]. Every time he set a screen we switched and did the things we were supposed to. Coach’s philosophy—we followed it and it worked out for us.”
With Rivard out of the picture, the Crimson had little chance to match the red hot Wildcats, who shot a season-high 60 percent (9-of-15) from three—well above their season average of 36.7 percent and tied for Arizona’s best-ever performance in a tournament game with at least 10 attempts. On the whole, the Wildcats shot above 55 percent for just the sixth time all year.
“Arizona played an outstanding ballgame,” Amaker said. “They deserved to win.”
SPURT ALERT
Harvard’s offensive struggles began from the start, as the Crimson missed its first 12 shots from the field.
Harvard’s first field goal—a Siyani Chambers three-pointer—did not come until 7:44 had elapsed, and by then, the Crimson was already down 17-2.
Amaker said the ice cold beginning—something Harvard had endured against Connecticut and Memphis earlier this season—was his worst nightmare.
“You’ve probably got to get off to a good start against a team like that, and we had our chances,” Amaker said. “We had some open opportunities early, and once we missed some, we kind of got our heads down, and they took advantage of it.”
Arizona responded to Chambers’ three by going on another 11-4 spurt to stretch its lead to 21 and in essence put the game away before the break, as Harvard had just three field goals in the game’s first 15 minutes.
“The shots we missed at the beginning were open,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We should have made them. If we [had], maybe the game would have been different. But the [Wildcats’] length was a problem.”
THE LYON KING
Arizona was sparked by the superb performance of Lyons, who tied a career-high with 27 points on 12-of-17 shooting.
“Mark is filled with confidence,” Miller said. “When he gets his confidence going, it’s contagious on our entire team.”
Facing the potential final game of his career, the senior point guard put his team on his back, weaving through the Harvard defense and getting to the basket with ease throughout the night.
“[He] attacked the bigs, attacked the ball screens, trying to get to the paint,” Chambers said. “He did what most great guards do—tried to make plays for himself, get two people to guard him, and make plays for his teammates. That’s what he did that I thought was very, very effective.”
That was something Lyons also did in his first tournament game this year, against No. 11 Belmont, when he poured in 23 points.
In so doing, Lyons earned another berth to the Sweet Sixteen, a point in the tournament that he had previously reached three times with Xavier, for whom he played before transferring to Arizona before this season.
“Today my teammates got me great shots,” Lyon said. “It’s great to be back in the Sweet Sixteen and trying to advance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior forward Victoria Lippert knocked down a triple from the right wing and pumped her fist as the Harvard women’s basketball team cut Drexel’s lead to 12 with 13 minutes remaining in the game.
But Dragons forward Taylor Wootton brought it down the court and dished the ball out to guard Hollie Mershon, who caught the ball behind the arc and sunk her own three in response. It was that kind of Saturday night for the Crimson, who couldn’t seem to get enough defensive power to stop a rolling Drexel team determined not to end its postseason.
At the Daskalakis Athletic Center, it was the Dragons’ guards running the show as Drexel (24-10) controlled the offensive glass to best Lippert and company and end Harvard’s (21-9) postseason run with a 82-72 win.
“Coming out from the beginning, we knew that they were a three-point team, that they were going to come out firing,” sophomore guard Ali Curtis said. “We knew they were going to come out, so we had to step up our defensive intensity, and I think we fought throughout the whole game, we just weren’t able to pull it out in the end.”
Throughout the game, the Crimson used multiple defensive looks, from two-one-two zones to full-court presses, but Drexel players seemed to box out taller Harvard players when shots wouldn’t fall to grab the ball and a fresh shot clock.
“They were running [an offense that] we’ve never seen before, and it’s very different from what most teams run, so we thought we would try different things on them,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought that took away their rhythm. But when you get an offensive board and you can kick it out and get an extra pass, that’s their rhythm—they love that rhythm.”
For the first time since a win at home against Princeton, Harvard was outrebounded by its opponents. Drexel pulled down 32 boards compared to the Crimson’s 22, with nearly half of those coming from the offensive glass.
“There was one possession where we must have played two to three straight minutes of defense because they got five or six offensive boards, and then they kick it out and make you play defense for 30 seconds—that’s how they play,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t believe they rebounded well all year, and I’m sure that was an emphasis for them because we have a height advantage and we should have rebounded better.”
A left hook-shot by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle gave Harvard the first points of the second half to cut the Drexel lead to four, but then the Dragons started marching. Rookie guard Megan Creighton came back with a trey of her own, and Wootton tossed in two consecutive jumpers to extend the lead to 12.
The Crimson struggled to diminish the advantage after that, as threes from Curtis and Fagbenle that cut the lead to six, the closest Harvard would get in the second half, were answered immediately.
“They shot the lights out, and they had the home-court advantage, so for a shooting team, that’s a pretty good advantage for them,” Delaney-Smith said. “They shot incredibly well. It was amazing how many shots were at the buzzer or at the 30-second clock. That’s what they do well—we knew that. They use screens well, and that’s their whole game, is looking to the three.”
The Crimson shot out to an early advantage in the first half, leading by as much as five, but Drexel overcame its slow start quickly, responding with a 5-0 run fueled solely by Mershon to tie the game.
“They wanted to slow the tempo of the game and use almost the whole shot clock to score the ball, and that isn’t our way of playing—we like to push the tempo and get easy buckets in transition,” Curtis said. “We came out firing and I thought that helped us in the beginning and towards the end, I don’t know if we pushed the ball as much as we should have.”
Harvard kept pace with the Dragons throughout much of the first half, exchanging leads with the home team multiple times. But with Mershon benched for foul trouble late in the first half, the Dragons found a new offensive weapon in freshman guard Rachel Pearson, who shot back-to-back threes to give Drexel a six-point lead heading into the half.
Mershon eclipsed her career high, finishing the game with 32 points to lead the Dragons offensively, while Lippert and Clark chipped in 15 points apiece for Harvard. Fagbenle, the Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and senior guard Elle Hagedorn notched 14 and 10 points, respectively, to join their teammates in double figures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have been The Game, but four months later at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson schooled Yale yet again.
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (2-4, 1-2 Ivy) earned its first conference victory against the Bulldogs (4-4, 0-3 Ivy), 10-5, on Saturday afternoon. It benefited from a diverse offensive attack driven by captain Micaela Cyr and fellow senior Danielle Tetrault, along with freshman Alexis Nicolia. The three each notched two goals through the contest.
“It’s Harvard-Yale so they’re always going to come out [and play hard],” Cyr said. “Defensively, we just tried to get in front, not foul and play our game like we know we can. [Goaltender Melanie Cook] came up with some huge saves, especially at the end of the game. Offensively, it’s the same thing; we tried working it and they pressured out.”
Despite blustering winds which caused the officials to occasionally pause the game, four other teammates found the back of the net. The seven scorers were the most in a game for the Crimson this season.
“If we’re a more balanced team, we’re harder to stop and I think that’s something that we’ve been trying to work on this week at practice,” Cyr said.
After entering the half up by two, a trio of goals in the first ten minutes of the second frame gave Harvard a five-point lead, 7-2.
As the second half opened, senior midfield Mariel Jenkins won a draw control and bolted down the field to snap the ball past Bulldog goaltender Erin McMullan. The goal was Jenkins’ first of the season. Just over eight minutes later, junior midfielder Lauren Tomkinson and Tetrault both scored unassisted goals within a minute of each other.
“I think it’s just important that when you have the lead, you’re looking to build on momentum coming out of halftime,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I think [Jenkins’s] goal definitely gave that to us. I think a lot of this game is about momentum and recognizing when you can pull away and when you need to make a stand.”
Yale scored three more times in the second half, with goals from Lauren Wackerle, Kerri Fleishhacker and Nicole Daniggelis. But its offense was too little too late.
Despite a yellow card on freshman midfield Tory Waldstein that put Harvard in a man-down situation, junior midfield Kyleigh Keating evaded defenders for her fifth goal of the season. Nearly two minutes later, still at a player-disadvantage, Cyr drew the ball left in the offensive zone to Nicolia, who drove the ball into the net over McMullan’s stick. To close the scoring, Tetrault scored a second unassisted goal with 1:35 left in regulation.
Five successful clear attempts during the second half allowed the Crimson to penetrate Yale’s offensive zone and dominate it.
Effective clearing and stick work in the middle of the field made room for Harvard’s attack unit to wind down the time and find looks at the net.
“I thought we played really well defensively,” Miller said. “We got ground balls and draw controls when we really needed it. I thought the attack was more patient than we have been. We called plays and moved off ball pretty well so I thought we managed the clock a bit better than we’ve been doing.”
Managing the time proved essential in the game, as college lacrosse does not use a shot clock.
“We separate the game into ten minute [pieces],” Cyr said. “We wanted to come out strong in the first ten minutes and set the tone and the same thing in the second half—we wanted to come out in the first ten minutes and set the tone for the rest of the game.”
The win was the second straight for the Crimson squad, which opened the season by dropping four decisions in a row.
“It’s a work in progress,” Miller said. “We’ve had some injuries and issues so I feel like the young kids are starting to fill roles and step it up. Overall I’ve been happy with practice. They go hard and are getting better every day. As a coach that’s all you can ask for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the spring break destination was California, the Harvard women’s water polo team did not have all that much time to relax in the sun.
Faced with a tough schedule of eight games in eight days, the Crimson (13-9, 2-0 CWPA) amassed valuable experience in the pool, especially with five games coming against teams nationally ranked.
Harvard capped off its trip with three losses against No. 10 San Jose State, No. 2 Stanford, and No. 5 California.
“We all were thinking about water polo the entire trip, so I think playing back-to-back like that every single day was really tough for us,” sophomore Victoria Frager said. “But this is the toughest part of our season by far, so our next couple tournaments and Easterns [are] hopefully going to seem like nothing in comparison.”
CALIFORNIA 22, HARVARD 9
In its final game of the trip, the Crimson could not keep pace with No. 5 California (13-5) and fell, 22-9.
Losers of its last three against tough western competition, the Golden Bears sought to take control of the game early and scored eight goals in the first quarter to Harvard’s two. Senior Emily Csikos, who sits four goals shy of tying Cal’s all-time scoring record, contributed three tallies in the period to fuel the offense.
After a more subdued second quarter, the Golden Bears put up another eight spot on the Crimson in the third, while Harvard could only muster a single tally from co-captain Aisha Price.
The 22 goals allowed were the most the Crimson has surrendered the entire year.
Junior Shayna Price led the Harvard offense with four goals on the game, including two in a fourth period that saw the Crimson outscore Cal, 5-3.
“I know we were all worried at the beginning of the year seeing the strength of our schedule and how difficult it looked, but coming in this week we had some good wins to start us off,” Frager said. “And I think that gave us the confidence we needed to play hard against the better teams.”
STANFORD 18, HARVARD 5
The Crimson faced its toughest test of the trip in No. 2 Stanford (15-1), which relied on a consistent offense to cruise to an 18-5 victory.
A perennial powerhouse whose only loss on the season came to top-ranked USC, the Cardinal built a seven-goal lead at the half and added to the margin after the intermission.
Harvard’s strongest period came in the third, when Aisha Price, junior Jelena Cyr, and Frager each snuck the ball past the Stanford goalie. But the Cardinal responded with six goals in the same quarter to put the game out of reach.
Aisha Price was the leading scorer for the Crimson with two goals.
Eight different players found the back of the cage for Stanford. Freshman Maggie Steffens, who finished with four goals, had a hat trick before the first period ended.
Despite the loss, the game against some of the nation’s best talent provided Harvard with valuable experience.
“I think we’re really improving and learning a lot from the games we’re playing,” sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes said. “It’s been a really great experience so far.”
SAN JOSE STATE 18, HARVARD 8
The Crimson took on its least formidable opponent of the three-game stretch in the Spartans—but that’s not saying much, as San Jose State (16-6) sits at number ten in the national rankings. Despite scoring eight goals, Harvard could not keep pace with the Spartans and fell by a ten-goal margin.
San Jose State came flying out of the gates, scoring six goals in the first period and seven more in the second to take a 13-2 lead at the half.
Although the halftime deficit was too much to overcome, Harvard demonstrated resilience after the break and went on to outscore the Spartans, 6-5.
“The thing about this team is that it’s a really close-knit team,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “They really like each other inside and outside the pool, and they’d do anything for each other…. Whatever they’re doing they’re giving their best because they don’t want to let their teammates down.”
A trio of players provided the brunt of the scoring for San Jose State. Sophomore Victoria Smith contributed a career-high five goals to lead all scoring, and two more Spartans added hat tricks.
Sophomore Kalina Grabb, the only Harvard player with multiple goals, supplied three tallies in the second half. Grabb also posted three steals to tie for team best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long and tiring stay in Texas, the Harvard baseball team evidently saved the best for last.
The Crimson took two out of three from Houston Baptist in a series spanning from Friday to Sunday. After dropping the first contest, Harvard went on to defeat the Huskies, 4-3, and took the final game by a 6-1 margin.
The wins capped off a trip in which the Crimson played ten games in ten days.
“Pretty much, over this trip, we want to leave it with good emotion,” sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson said. “We want to come back to Ivies and use the play against these much more difficult teams to help us in the Ivies and hopefully get us a couple wins there.”
HARVARD 6, HOUSTON BAPTIST 1
In its final game of the trip Sunday afternoon, Harvard outplayed the Huskies from start to finish to nab its second straight win by a score of 6-1.
Freshman pitcher Sean Poppen came through with a huge performance on the mound for the visiting squad. Poppen provided much-needed relief to a fatigued Crimson rotation by throwing 113 pitches in a complete game effort.
Aside from a second inning in which Houston Baptist notched two hits and a run, Poppen was flawless for much of the game. The freshman went the next six innings without giving up a hit and got Harvard back in the dugout quickly with a number of one-two-three innings.
“We couldn’t ask anything more of our freshman and sophomore class,” Anderson said. “To come in without any college experience for the freshmen especially, and for them to be doing as well as they are, it definitely helps the team tremendously.”
The Crimson took advantage of sloppy defense from the Huskies, who committed seven errors in the game. After scoring one run in the fourth, sixth, and seventh innings, Harvard broke the game open in the ninth with three runs, two of which came on wild pitches.
Sophomore utility Mike Martin fueled the Crimson with a hit, two RBIs, two walks, and three runs scored. Another top offensive contributor was sophomore catcher Ethan Ferreira, who notched a game-high two hits.
HARVARD 4, HOUSTON BAPTIST 3
Harvard earned its first victory since the opening game of the season on Saturday afternoon, refusing to let a close one slip away in the late innings.
Although the Huskies showed signs of a rally in the eighth and the ninth, senior pitcher Jordan Haviland got the best of the Houston Baptist batters in clutch situations and sealed the 4-3 victory for the Crimson.
Freshman pitcher Matt Sanders earned the win for Harvard, giving up two earned runs in seven innings of work.
“We did a good job of pitching and the defense behind us was doing pretty well,” Anderson said. “It was fundamental baseball, so it was good to finally be able to play up to our standards. We definitely did hit the ball better today and it was spread among everyone instead of just one or two guys swinging it.”
The Crimson first scored in the top of the third. Anderson led off with a single and was moved over to third before a two-out double from Kregel plated him for the first run of the game.
After scoring once in each of the next two innings, the final run of the day—and what would eventually prove to be the game-winner—came off a seventh-inning single from freshman catcher DJ Link.
All but one Harvard starter registered a hit on the day. Martin and senior infielder Rob Wineski paced the offense, each contributing three hits.
HOUSTON BAPTIST 12, HARVARD 6
In the first game of the series against the Huskies, the Crimson started off on the wrong foot.
Harvard surrendered 11 runs in the first four innings, and although the Crimson offense pushed some runs across the board later, it would not be enough as Houston Baptist claimed a 12-6 victory.
The top of the Harvard order came to life Friday night, as the first five hitters combined to post nine of the team’s 13 hits. Ferreira went three-for-five with a triple.
Despite finding itself in a big hole after four frames, the Crimson refused to quit and scored two runs on a pair of singles in the top of the fifth.
After pushing across one more off a Kregel double two innings later, Harvard scored three more runs in the ninth, highlighted by a Ferreira double that plated two.
“The trip is all about experience,” said sophomore third baseman Nick Saathoff. “We have a lot of young guys who haven’t had that much experience. So we’re trying to get as much experience as we can heading into the Ivy season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After breaking into the AP Top 25, the No. 23 Harvard men’s tennis team (12-4) captured the Mission Valley Spring Classic. The Crimson finished with a 4-2 win Saturday over No. 20 Drake (17-2), culminating a three-day stretch in which the team took 12 of 16 matches.
“I think, first of all, it is great playing outdoors because it is more of a physical game,” sophomore Henry Steer said. “The match in the finals is a really good match for the team because it showed we can beat good opponents. It was a good confidence-building win against a top 20 opponent. It’s a match where the team came together and found a way to win.”
HARVARD 4, DRAKE 2
Harvard began quickly against Drake, taking two of the doubles matches in quick succession. Junior Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen took the line one doubles, 8-3, while freshmen Kelvin Lam and sophomore Alex Steinroeder defeated Drake’s line three team, 9-7.
In singles, Lam quickly fell on line six to Drake’s Ben Mullis, 6-1, 6-1. However, freshman Nicky Hu, senior Andy Nguyen, and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri were able to pull out wins to clinch the victory for Harvard. Hu lost the first set, 2-6, to Drake’s Jean Erasmus before finishing the match off, 6-3, 7-6(5).
“I think the main strength of this team is its fight and resiliency,” Steer said. “This team wins matches when guys go out there and they don’t have their best day, but they find a way to win. A lot of times it just takes fight and heart and finding a way to get it done.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO STATE 1
In the semifinals, the Crimson defeated host San Diego State behind two wins from Denis Nguyen. Nguyen and MacMaster took line one doubles, and then in the singles, Nguyen lost the first set, 2-6, to the Aztecs’ Derek Siddiqui but battled back to take the next two sets, 6-0, 6-1.
While Steinroeder lost in the number three line against Aztec Hunter Nicholas, Andy Nguyen and Hu pulled out wins on lines four and five to propel Harvard to victory. Hu and Nguyen lost a combined seven games in the two matches.
“I thought everyone on the team played well [this week],” Chaudhuri said. “We went outdoors for the first time this season, and we competed well. We had a couple days to train outdoors, and I think everyone worked hard and was ready, and we took out some very good teams so it was a very good week overall.”
HARVARD 4, UAB 1
Harvard stretched its win streak to five in its Thursday opener, defeating UAB, 4-1, in the first round of the tournament. Steinroeder and Lam did not lose a game in winning their doubles opener, 8-0, and Andy Nguyen and Hu helped the Crimson clinch the doubles point with an 8-1 victory.
In singles, Harvard recorded wins in straight sets at the second, fourth, and fifth lines. Lam continued his hot start, winning the first six games of his match to stretch his streak to 14 in a row before winning the final set, 7-5. Denis Nguyen fell, 6-3, 6-3, in line one action, and MacMaster and Steinroeder were in second-set tiebreakers when they stopped playing. It was the first match of the year that the Crimson played outside.
“I thought we fought really well,” Steer said. “Especially in the finals...the other team was very rowdy and brought a lot of energy. I thought we matched that energy and rose to the occasion. We played a lot better at the end of the tournament then at the beginning.”
Chaudhuri said that the strength of the team, which is very young, with only one senior and two juniors, is its depth. The sophomore said that the team boasts equal talent across its lineup and that, one through six, it has the ability to pull out tough matches.
“I don’t want to say as a younger team we have more of a learning curve and we are definitely growing each day to help our team in the future,” Chaudhuri. “We are a really even team. Its not like we have a couple good players and it drops off; anyone can come away with a win on any day."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team leveled its conference record on Saturday afternoon with its first Ivy League win coming against Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H.
Harvard never trailed on its way to a 9-6 victory.
“We were pretty consistent on both sides of the ball,” senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger said. “We buckled down and didn’t let them have a shot to win.”
After a long scoreless stretch to start the game, the Crimson (4-3, 1-1 Ivy) earned a 1-0 lead over the Big Green (2-4, 0-1) towards the end of the first quarter thanks to a goal by junior attackman Carl Zimmerman.
Then, just 19 seconds into the second quarter, junior attackman Peter Schwartz scored for Harvard, extending the lead during a man-up opportunity.
But the Big Green responded quickly with two straight goals, and it looked like the teams would go into halftime tied.
Instead, with only five seconds remaining in the half, junior midfielder Pat Fiorvanti caught a pass from freshman Devin Dwyer and put the ball in the net, vaulting the Crimson back in front.
“It was definitely huge to have that momentum,” senior captain Jason Gonos said. “Going into the second half knowing that we still had control of the game and that we could come out on top was huge.”
Early on in the second half, Harvard was assessed a one-minute penalty for tripping, but refused to give in.
The man-down unit forced a turnover, with Gonos picking up a loose ball, which the Crimson successfully cleared into its offensive end. Instead of simply running out the remainder of the penalty, Harvard attacked, and Schwartz came up with his second goal of the game, this time man-down instead of man-up.
“Schwartz played great,” Gonos said. “It’s awesome having him on the field this year. He’s really been a huge presence.”
Dartmouth would score again, bringing the game to 4-3, but it proved too little to turn the tide as Zimmerman and Gabriel Mendola rallied off two quick goals for the Crimson in rapid succession, just 11 seconds apart.
“Our defense has really needed to step up and stop [their runs],” Gonos said. “In the past we would play good defense for most of the game, but then the other team would go on a run and put us in a hole. [This time], I think we were prepared to stop them mentally on the defensive end.”
The Big Green was knocking on the door again before the end of the third quarter, but Harvard answered with goals by Jack Walker, Murphy Vandervelde, and the team’s leading scorer, Alex White, to secure the Crimson’s first Ivy League win and a .500 record in Ivy League play.
“We’ve been taking a good amount of shots throughout the season,” Krieger said. “Now they’re finally starting to fall into place. This should only increase as the season goes on.”
Krieger notched 13 saves with a save percentage of .680 to increase his season totals to 82 and .586, respectively. Both lead the Ivy League. The goalkeeper has been remarkably strong lately, with a save percentage of .640 over his last four games.
“Harry’s been playing lights out,” Gonos said. “As a defender, that’s huge for my confidence and it just helps the whole defense.”
The Crimson’s faceoff men, Rick Molé and Mendola, helped the team control the flow of the game throughout the contest. Together, they dominated, securing 12 out of 18 faceoffs. Molé was responsible for most of these, going 10-16, while Mendola relieved him on two occasions and won both times.
“It’s great to have strong faceoff guys,” Krieger said. “When you can get the ball back after a team scores you can reclaim any momentum.”
Going forward, Harvard takes a break from Ivy League play for a week, facing Albany and No. 13 Duke at home on March 26th and 30th, respectively.
The Crimson’s next conference game is against national powerhouse Cornell on April 6. The Big Red ranks second in the country and leads the nation in goals per game.
“Cornell is notoriously strong,” Krieger said. “The Albany and Duke games are great before going into the [bulk] of the Ivy League schedule. It will help us keep our composure and pull through as a cohesive unit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After having a four-game winning streak snapped in a 4-3 loss to South Florida, the Harvard women’s tennis team (7-4) got back to its winning ways with a 7-0 victory over Farleigh Dickinson on Saturday. The victory capped off a solid spring break in which the Crimson won two of its three matches.
“In general, we played really well over the break,” co-captain Hideko Tachibana said. “It was a tough transition for our team because playing outdoors has a lot of different elements. We played a couple of really good teams, and I think we put up a really good fight.”
Over the course of the spring thus far, the Crimson has battled both injuries and sickness and struggled to field its optimal lineup. But according to Tachibana, injured athletes have also played an important role.
“I think that having everyone on the team has brought a lot of energy to the team overall,” Tachibana said. “It’s not like other sports where being on the sidelines you can’t play and are miserable; in tennis, it’s good [for the people on the court] to have the positive energy out there.”
HARVARD 7, FARLEIGH DICKINSON 0
Harvard finished its spring-break tour with a 7-0 victory over the Knights at the Murr Center. The Crimson lost only two games on the way to wins in the first and third line doubles matches, with freshman Amanda Lin and sophomore Sylvia Li blanking their opponents. In line one doubles, Tachibana and fellow co-captain Kristin Norton won, 8-2, to extend their unbeaten record in non-conference play.
In singles, Harvard won all but one match in straight sets. Junior Hannah Morrill did not cede a game to opponent Nicole Christ, claiming a 6-0, 6-0 victory at line five. In line one, Tachibana rebounded after losing her second set, 4-6, to take the final, 10-7. Overall, the Crimson won eight sets in which it lost two or fewer games.
SOUTH FLORIDA 4, HARVARD 3
Against South Florida, the Crimson struggled at the top of its singles lineup. While Harvard won the doubles points handily, with Li and Lin taking line three, 8-1, and Tachibana and Norton winning, 8-4, at the top line, the top four Crimson players lost their singles matches in straight sets.
At line five and line six, freshman Hai Li-Kong and Lin pulled out gritty three-set victories over their respective Bulls opponents. Lin lost the first set in a tiebreaker, 6-7 (6-8), but won the next two sets 6-4, 6-4. Kong won the first set, 6-3, and after falling in the second, 6-4, took the third when her opponent retired with Kong leading 2-0.
“Overall the team is handling big points a lot better,” coach Traci Green said. “Our doubles [play] has improved tremendously. I thought that there were good matches over the break. We got more experience that will help us heading into our last match of the season before the Ivy schedule starts.”
HARVARD 5, STETSON 2
Harvard began its spring break play with a 5-2 win over Stetson. The Crimson took every doubles match, losing six games in three matches. In singles, Harvard took two of three three-set matches played, with Tachibana and Kong taking third sets at the first and fourth lines, respectively. After losing the first set, 5-7, Kong lost only three games before topping Stetson’s Lindsey Cable in the next two sets, 6-3, 6-0. At line five, Lin defeated Jen Miller, 6-0, 6-3, and freshman Amy He clinched the victory with a, 6-1, 7-6, win in line three singles.
Tachibana said that the team, which finishes its nonconference schedule with a match on Mar. 30, will face a different set of challenges in Ancient Eight play.
The senior said that in conference play, with more familiar opponents, the atmosphere becomes more contentious between the Crimson and its foes.
“Ivy League matches are a lot more personal,” Tachibana said. “The fans are more belligerent and, overall, it’s on a whole other level. For the freshmen, its important to realize that it’s anybody’s game and talent-wise everyone is pretty much on the same level across the board. It will come down to who is fighting for the last point and who wants it more. The next match against Syracuse will be a good indicator, and the freshmen will be in for a good surprise come Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cinderella is leaving Salt Lake City battered, bruised, and—in the case of freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—without one of her teeth. After a shocking 68-62 victory over New Mexico on Thursday, the story was very different for the Crimson Saturday night against the Arizona Wildcats in a 74-51 loss.
Playing junior tennis in Texas, I vividly remember a stretch my sophomore year of high school where in nine of 10 tournaments—spanning almost three-quarters of a year—I lost in the second round every time. Although very different sports across the board, watching the Crimson Saturday I saw a lot of same the problems.
In tennis tournaments, the seeds and better players get the byes and await you in later rounds. Against superior players, imposing your game and not playing on their terms can is the toughest part. While Harvard imposed its game on the Lobos, speeding up the pace of play and denying New Mexico stars Kendall Williams and Tony Snell open shots, Arizona came out from the tip and made the Crimson play the Wildcats’ game. Early on, scrambling Harvard defenders adjusted to their opponents’ play; every Wildcat jumper was taken without a defender in sight.
Higher seeds, whether in basketball or tennis, are those teams and players that know how to win. Teams have single digits by their name because they know how to win; being able to run with a lead is something favorites do well. Against New Mexico, Harvard came out and delivered the first punch. The Crimson scored the first nine of the first 11 points of the game and didn’t shy from the moment. Arizona hit Harvard with consecutive haymakers and didn’t let the team back up off the mat. Harvard needed nearly eight minutes to get its first basket and was down 21 points 12 minutes into the game. Coming out against a tougher opponent, Harvard looked intimidated and outmatched early on.
As the game goes on, both tennis and basketball have inherent breaks in the flow of the game that help players regroup and refocus on their game. For me, the break between sets was crucial in the fresh start that it provided. Halftime proved to be the same for the Crimson, but it was too little, too late. The Crimson were outscored by only five points in the second half and adjusted well after a miserable first half. Although Harvard posted equally dismal shooting splits in the second half (it finished 28 percent from both the field and the three-point line), it was able to get the shots it wanted from the field. The Crimson turned the ball over only eight times in the game and extended possessions with 11 offensive rebounds (nine in the second half). Harvard forced 12 turnovers and generated nine more shots and three more free throws than their opponents but simply could not convert. Sophomore wing Wesley Saunders drew foul after foul on Wildcat bigs on drives, but had his worst shooting day from the field (one for 11) of the season and failed to reach double-digits for the first time all year.
At the end, however, the higher seeds are higher seeds because of they know how to finish. Arizona jump-started their season with a 65-64 victory over Florida at home where they held the Gators scoreless over the past 2:35 and showed grit all weekend in wins over Belmont and Harvard. Against both teams, Arizona led by double digits at half and every time its opponent made a run, it shut it down with stiff defense and fluid offense. Senior guard Mark Lyons (50 points combined in the two games) single-handedly kept both lower seeds at bay by driving into the paint at will and finishing with a variety of moves. Arizona weathered the loss of frontcourt players Kevin Parrom, Brandon Ashley, and Grant Jerrett to fouls and injury with consistent effort on the defensive end. Guard Nick Johnson smothered junior Laurent Rivard and seven-footer Kaleb Tarczewski and forward Solomon Hill combined to shut down Wesley Saunders.
Tennis and basketball matches both end with handshakes, a gruff acknowledgment that your opponent was the better player that day. Against an opponent bringing McDonald’s All-Americans off the bench, Harvard was outsize and outmatched. There is no shame in what happened Saturday for Tommy Amaker’s squad; in Harvard most successful season ever, the team acquitted itself well in the second half. With Casey, Curry, and Edosomwan on the way, the 2012-2013 edition will be better than this year’s squad. Sometimes, you just shake your opponent’s hand and tell them ‘Good game’. For Harvard, it was one of those days.
