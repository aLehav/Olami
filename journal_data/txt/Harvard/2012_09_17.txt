After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Killers are savvy veterans of the billboard charts. Their first single, “Somebody Told Me,” hit #3 on the alternative chart in 2004, and since then they have ruled the rock airways with countless anthems. With vivacious instrumentation and Brandon Flowers’ signature lead vocals, the songs of the long-awaited album “Battle Born” also have the potential to become catchy billboard hits. However, repetitive melodies, unoriginal instrumentation, and generic subject matter prevent the album from being strong as a cohesive whole. On “Battle Born,” the Killers seek to entertain rather than to make an artistic statement.
The opening song, “Flesh and Bone,” is as catchy as its predecessors in the Killers’ canon. The track opens with digital tones and an electric harpsichord to create a foreign, futuristic feel before a swell of strings introduces a classic Killers chorus: a full soundscape of toms and guitars dotted with electric tonal riffs. Without losing momentum, the style rapidly changes in the middle of the song to a seductive, minimalistic groove in which the piano complements the drum beat.
“Miss Atomic Bomb” is another earworm. Here the Killers emulate the name of the song’s principal character, Atomic Bomb, through both the instrumentation and lyrics. An explosion of drums and guitar leads to the climatic chorus, and the song gradually devolves until the end. The lyrics play on double-entendres referencing the title character’s name to create vivid images of the story. Flowers emotes the sorrow of heartbreak as he sings, “The dust clouds have settled / And my eyes are clear / But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear / This Atomic Bomb.”
However, the majority of the album fails to maintain the  energy of these choice singles, as the worst songs revert to tired instrumentation and lyricism. “The Way It Was” is an example of the generic, deflated instrumental development. The buildups, driven by synchronous beating of the snare, tom and bass guitar, lack the strength and energy to lift the song to its expected climaxes. During the verses, the instrumentation seems to be present almost purely for the purpose of keeping tempo, as the drums, bass, and guitar rarely deviate from their monotonous roles.
“Be Still” has similar problems. The melodramatic piano chords and strings fail to provide any real emotional weight for the ballad. In the second verse, a hi-hat and snare beat join the bare instrumental track, which remains relatively constant and cheesy for the entire song. Moreover, the song’s lyrics are filled with clichés and uncreative phrases: “Be still and go on to bed / nobody knows what lies ahead / and life is short to say the least / we’re in the belly of the beast.”
However, the Killers keep the album varied enough to make for an enjoyable listen all the way through. On “From Here on Out,” the band goes country, as acoustic strumming, sparse drums, and clapping keep an upbeat tempo in the background while chipper electric guitar and drawling vocals propel the track forward. The band completes the sound with a drawn out “Heeey” at the beginning of the chorus. And swinging electric guitar chords, as heard in the chorus of the final song “Battle Born,” emulate the style of ’80s rock, whereas the choral-like accompaniment in the finale is reminiscent of Queen’s vocal style. Nevertheless, the song showcases the Killer’s patience and ability to build up a number of instrumental and vocal layers over the course of the song.
The Killers certainly do have the ability to create catchy pop-rock anthems, as demonstrated over the years and in “Battle Born.” However, this album’s quality is highly variable. Its tunes are at once hummable and largely forgettable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few modern musicians have managed to achieve the level of cultural dominance that Kanye West currently possesses. He may be an easy target for mockery—one South Park episode centered entirely on his ego—the reason he is so frequently the subject of parody and tabloids is simply that people recognize Kanye West. But while he is well known for his loud personality, West has always managed to produce music that keeps up with his high-volume persona. His most recent work, “Cruel Summer”—a collaborative effort by his record label and crew,  G.O.O.D. Music—despite a few small flaws, is of the high caliber fans have come to expect.
West has always cultivated a strong brand, both in his image and his music, and now he sits atop a record label filled with rising stars and living legends alike. G.O.O.D. Music includes John Legend, Common, Kid Cudi, Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), Pusha T, and others. “Cruel Summer” is the group’s first record, and it is certainly not wanting for more talent, as West deftly integrates these artists and many more into each song to create a varied and fascinating ride. However, the abundance of talent on the album also detracts from the experience, as West’s normally dazzling presence is obscured somewhat by the multitude of other artists attempting to shine alongside him.
At its best moments, “Cruel Summer” flawlessly interweaves many very different artists to great effect. “Mercy” begins with an unorthodox chant as a hook, then launches into West, Big Sean, Pusha T, and 2 Chainz trading verses. This track shows how collaboration can work beautifully, with four very different artists delivering very distinctive performances in a fairly simple format without any pretense or confusion. Big Sean is able to display what West dubbed “hashtag rap” with broken simile and puns, and Pusha T’s smooth flow and high voice plays nicely against West’s hard hitting delivery. The juxtaposition highlights the individuality of each artist.  “New God Flow” works in much the same way, with Pusha T, West, and Ghostface Killah delivering consecutive concussive verses. This is the way posse albums work best: with rappers trading verses, allowing their personalities to shine together without any one artist attempting to outshine the rest.
Tracks like  “To The World” and “Creepers” represent another way in which collaborative tracks can work effectively. Both tracks feature only one artist in addition to West and serve as a true showcase of the featured artist’s personality and identity. The opener, “To The World,” is a fantastic blend of West and R. Kelly: The track drips with Kelly’s trademark bump-and-grind flow and gospel crooning, and grandiose drums and dramatic bass set the stage for another Kanye spectacle.
“Creepers” is an unexpected gem. The track features Kid Cudi, whose melodic mumbles are  lovely and haunting. The mix of Cudi’s self-examination and singsong droning with Dan Black’s solemn, airy production results in a stirring and earnest track that seems almost out of place nestled in the middle of this album.
The pitfalls of this large collaboration are only apparent when the album is viewed holistically. Unlike West’s previous works, such as the conceptual masterpiece “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” “Cruel Summer” sounds like a compilation of very solid singles rather than a carefully constructed and deliberately laid out album. Even West’s previous collaborative work, “Watch The Throne,” had very clearly defined roles for West and Jay-Z, but “Cruel Summer” suffers from the fact that it has a huge number of artists all attempting to distinguish themselves. While the artists, both big and small, manage to orbit smoothly around West and coexist harmoniously at points, numerous and conflicting artistic presences cloud the normally iron-clad vision and bravado of West albums.
However, to say that “Cruel Summer” is a bad album for these reasons alone would be foolish. It is still one of the best hip-hop releases of the year, with just about every song on the album capable of standing on its own as a powerful single. Kanye West still stands tall with this newest release, with production and flow so killer that his fans and haters alike will be begging for mercy.

The xx recently joined Tumblr in order to share their “inspirations + pictures + favourite songs” with an international and borderline-reverent fan base that has continued to grow in number since the band’s first release, “xx,” in 2009. The posts range from pictures of grey beaches and shattered glass to Four Tet remixes and Fleetwood Mac tracks.
It wouldn’t be surprising if the xx drew from just as wide an array of sources to create their sophomore release, “Coexist:” the album wavers uncertainly between the sparse aesthetic of their debut album and a more typical synth-driven pop record. The result is an occasionally confused but still enjoyable record from a band that seems unsure how to evolve without edging into the realm of mediocre ambient nightclub music.
On “xx,” the band wrote three types of songs: songs about being in love, songs about being in love at night, and songs about being in love and unhappy. “Angels,” the opening track on “Coexist,” falls into the first group, as Madley Croft croons, “And every day / I am learning about you / The things that no one else sees,” and ends on an almost-whisper. The song could have easily appeared on “xx:” a single sparkling guitar introduces Romy Madley Croft’s recognizably breathy vocals, while producer and band member Jamie xx’s thudding beat creeps in at the halfway mark.
“Angels” is the beginning of an album-long story arc that takes the listener through the ups and downs of a relationship. Madley Croft and Oliver Sim sing frankly and with authenticity about both intimacy and isolation: both “Angels” and the third track “Fiction” possess a warm wistfulness, as the singers describe the unhappiness that comes with separation. Halfway through the record, however, the lyrics grow more pessimistic as Sim drawls, “And now there’s no hope for you and me / My heart is beating in a different way.” As the album draws to a close, redemption is offered in the final track, “Our Song,” made both melancholy and hopeful by lines like, “You know I know you’re hurt / I want to mend your heart / And there’s no one else.”
The two singers navigate this storyline with varying degrees of success. On several songs, the emotions behind the lyrics are marred as Madley Croft’s previously clear, shimmering vocals morph into numb monotones or verge on whines. On “Reunion,” she sounds uncharacteristically off-key. Sim, in contrast, displays an expanded range and depth in his vocals as he and Madley Croft weave around each other, maintaining a compelling tension by overlapping and blurring their respective vocals together.
This unique dynamic is at times undone by jarring backbeats that are much more prevalent on “Coexist” than on “xx.” The band, drawing inspiration from club music, attempts to blend its signature use of silence and space with pronounced production from Jamie xx. However, the two styles do not always mesh well, as evidenced by the grating mix of pulsating club beats and steel drums on “Reunion.” When the combination does work, as in “Chained” and “Tides,” the sharp and distinct beat is highlighted by the silences that precede and follow it.
As “Coexist” draws to a close, listeners are lured back in as the xx step again into familiar territory. “Swept Away” features simple, striking guitar and piano chords as Madley Croft and Sim continue to converse in their rich vocals. And, on the closing track “Our Song,” the two singers are at their strongest, effortlessly harmonizing over an unassuming guitar and bringing the album full circle.
However, the band’s forays outside its comfort zone and into dance music are much less successful. The xx fared better when they sang about stars and night skies, and it’s hard to see those inside a smoky nightclub.

Four dead in Benghazi, the America embassy stormed in Cairo, and protests across the Islamic World. Those calling for a post-post-9/11 era will have to wait a little longer. Anonymous statements by U.S. officials on Tuesday claimed that the attack in Libya was considered a premeditated assault unrelated to the demonstrations that spread beyond the Arab world from Nigeria to Bangladesh. This watershed moment in regional relations arises from an unexpected place—an obscure short film of unclear origin that denigrates the prophet Mohamed.
A trailer for the video first appeared on YouTube in July. I warn you, though, it is very offensive—and I’m not just referring to its dark depiction of Islam’s prophet. With its plastic axes, fake Santa Claus beards, misplaced green screen backdrops, and irregularly dubbed lines, the trailer makes “On Harvard Time” look like a Spielberg production.
In Cairo, protesters inexplicably overcame the American Embassy’s security to enter the embassy’s grounds and tear apart its American flag. Many news outlets, perhaps with little other information to use, emphasized the protesters’ black flags with the Islamic statement of faith—a popular symbol among many radical political Islamists. Actually, the storming of the embassy is better explained by another prominent image from the demonstrations.
The graffiti splashed on the walls from which the American flag was torn said “A.C.A.B.” Unless you study post-World War II British leftist labor movements, you are probably unaware of the All Coppers Are Bastards acronym. I saw that acronym throughout Cairo, and it was often the only graffiti written in English. In Egypt and many other countries across the Islamic World, the state has lost, or is losing, its legitimacy. A.C.A.B. symbolizes a burgeoning phenomenon that could be referred to as a “protest culture.” I would suggest that Islamism is only the weaker expression of a broader anger against power in its domestic and foreign forms.
“Echoes of ’79?” asked a friend, referring to Iran’s 1979 Revolution. The short answer is a simple “no.” Most longer answers to this question emphasize the significant religious, social, and political distinctions between Iran and the Arab world. While acknowledging the validity of those distinctions, I would suggest that the aspirations and structure of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood of today strongly resemble those of Iran’s Islamic revolutionaries of ’79. That’s the bad news. The good news is that massive global economic and political developments of the last thirty years render those aspirations suicidal.
When it comes to the United States and much of the Arab world, the simple truth is that we need each other. Much has been made of the implications of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s trips to Saudi Arabia and China. However, for now at least, the Arab world still needs economic aid from the West in the form of annual military funds, myriad economic programs, and support within the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. As demographic, monetary, and institutional challenges multiply, the Arab world needs Western support more than ever. As most states in the region shift in unpredictable ways, America needs Arab allies more than ever. This mutual need demands a relationship based on respect.
America can begin to rebuild that respect by holding responsible those implicated in last week’s actions. America must uphold the international principle of the sanctity of foreign embassies and consulates. When Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Egypt suffered a series of protests in April, Saudi Arabia closed its embassy and recalled its envoy back to Riyadh. This move precipitated earnest Egyptian apologies and the President’s trip to Saudi Arabia immediately following his election. Today, relations between the two countries are very strong.
A nearly constant complaint one hears as an American in the Arab world is that America selectively chooses when to uphold its values. These events, which are fundamentally about the scope of individual liberty, are an opportunity to be consistent. Rather than emphasizing that “There is never any justification for violence of this kind,” as Hillary Clinton did, or trying to score political points like Mitt Romney, we need to articulate why a broad definition of freedom of expression makes our society stronger. We need to prove that our compulsion to defend the right to defame is more essential to our identity than our revulsion to that defamation.

One morning back home several weeks ago, my brother and I woke up early and headed out to the attraction in Florida with the longest lines: the Department of Motor Vehicles. My brother needed to update his license picture, and made sure I was awake early enough to accompany him. Like all good Americans, we were ready and eager to deal with the government’s most efficient agency, and couldn’t wait to get there.
We arrived at the DMV shortly before opening, and the line stretched around the building. The early crowd was a particularly political one: Obama t-shirts outnumbered Hawaiian beach shirts, a rare phenomenon by the beaches of South Florida. (There was also one Romney t-shirt.) Of course, it makes sense that the politicos were the early birds: only political junkies are aware of a Federal statute mandating that all departments of vehicles, motor or otherwise, begin lunch break for its employees at 10 a.m. In fact, a confusing array of federal regulations mandate that waiting time must be at least an hour and every fifth person in line must be sent to another DMV at least fifty miles away.
After waiting the better part of an hour, my brother and I were ushered inside, only to wait in line and be told he would need a birth certificate, social security card, old license, notarized letter of recommendation, and two unique documents attesting to his current address. We were sent to a counter, where my brother provided his paperwork and life biography. The man behind the counter spent fifteen minutes inspecting the documents before informing us that we were missing a second paper authenticating our address. My brother then presented his current driver’s license. This was not accepted. The man explained to us that the DMV does not recognize its own ID cards as valid forms of identification.
I walked out and over to the car, on the off chance that a second piece of mail just happened to be laying in the glove compartment. I very much did not want to have to drive home, root through the trash, and find a crumpled envelope with coleslaw bits and mustard smears to present to the DMV. As luck would have it, I found a granola bar in the glove compartment. I did not, however, find further proof of address tied to my brother’s name.
On my way back from the car, I noticed the only man in all of Broward County wearing a Romney shirt standing ready at another counter, ready to endure his impending punishment. This gentleman was waiting for the woman behind the desk to finish her Slurpee and renew his license. Protected by her government-mandated coffee break, she simply sat there, slurping away and daring him to speak to her manager. So, of course, the Romney man was just itching to fire her. “We like to streamline businesses,” I could hear him think, “and you are the weakest link. Goodbye.”
I began to wonder how Romney himself would engage the staff, or the parts of the staff he kept. “Oh, so you have minimum wage-paying jobs? I understand what such a situation is like—I’m unemployed. Ha ha ha. Aren’t I funny? But on a more serious note, if you work hard, you can one day get promoted to branch manager, and maybe be as successful as someone like me. On an unrelated note, I need the tags on four of my Cadillacs updated.” He can really be quite a motivator when he needs to be.
But Mitt Romney would never rely entirely on carrots if he were to run the DMV; he’d use his fair share of sticks as well. Any underproductive worker would be strapped to the roof of a test car as 16-year-olds whiz around the parking lot like go-kart drivers and are granted legal permission to do the same on public roads. Not to worry for the teenagers’ sake: any unpleasant bodily emissions resulting from the rides will be immediately hosed off the windshield. And Romney would not quit until he saw results. Or sold the DMV.
I finally rejoined my brother at the counter, and after 20 more minutes of debate about the missing piece of mail, the man helping us offhandedly mentioned that emails work too. With the help of his phone, my brother pulled up an email, and we were good to go. A mere half-hour later, the process was over. Walking back to the car, we both let out a sigh of relief that the visit did not take more than one calendar day. More importantly, though, I realized how to fix the system: Appoint Mitt Romney chief executive officer of the DMV. He would get the job done.

To the Students of Harvard College: We are here to reinvigorate the Undergraduate Council, and we ask you to reimagine your role as a student on this campus. Even if you have not paid attention to prior UC elections, this election presents an opportunity to engage.
It is commonly believed around our campus that the UC has untapped potential and can do more. We want to show you how that can finally be achieved through your participation in this election.
In recent years, the Undergraduate Council has focused primarily on its role as an allocator of student group funds, an event planner and promoter, and an arbiter of student voice. These roles are an important part of college life, but we should not be afraid to broaden our ambitions. We are not out to “stage a UC coup” or to create a party system; rather, we believe in the promise of the UC. This is an opportunity to transform student government and use it as a tool to build student empowerment.
The time for change is now.
A legitimate, effective student government pursues high-minded objectives. We envision a student government that addresses a wide range of student concerns—from campus-wide policy issues, to Harvard’s role in the local community and the world, to issues of day-to-day student life—advocating on behalf of sound solutions directly to the University administration. With a renewed mentality, we can align the present role of the UC with Harvard’s storied history of student activism and empowered student government.
We seek to build on past UC student empowerment efforts. First, we believe that an improved referendum process should allow student groups to propose ballot questions every semester. Six years ago undergraduates cast ballots in a UC-sponsored referendum to support a proposal for Harvard to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The move led President Drew G. Faust to implement an ambitious set of policies to realize that goal.
Second, we want to revitalize the idea of a Forum for Change, as an innovative platform to bring together diverse student groups and individuals to pitch their ideas for change and to provide a broad arena for productive collaboration.
We also seek to implement several preliminary initiatives. Working in cooperation with student government organizations across Harvard, we aim to ensure that students are included in University-wide governance. We believe that student representatives deserve seats on the Harvard Corporation, along with other high-level University governing bodies.
We also intend to utilize the UC to create a University-wide coalition of student governments to confront issues that affect all members of the Harvard community, regardless of school affiliation.
This election, the Crimson Coalition is running to bring you an alternative on the ballot. We seek to re-invent student government from the inside out by electing like-minded change-makers committed to harnessing student power and awakening student consciousness on substantive University issues.
Whatever our differences on particular policy points, we can all agree that the UC should prioritize expanding its role in University governance. Change, moreover, requires a cultural shift within the UC, which our candidate coalition proudly embodies. With our victories, we stand to build a UC that supports coalitions of student group leaders and other members of the Harvard community, addresses substantive administrative policy decisions, and provides opportunities for the student body to create positive social change at Harvard.
This is just the beginning. We come equipped with the energy, vision, and drive to guide in a new era—but we ask for your support to help make our bold plans an even bolder reality. The Crimson Coalition needs to be more than just our voices; it must be a resounding echo of the student body.
So vote for Crimson Coalition candidates this week. Vote for a transformed UC. Vote for the chance to make your voice matter.

There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of parties on and off campus during the past two weekends thanks to a recent increase in activity by the Cambridge Police Department. Numerous parties  to be held at off-campus locations including the final clubs, the Hasty Pudding Club, the Advocate and The Crimson itself were canceled amid warnings that the CPD would shut them down. The weekends have been distinctly quieter as stories fly around campus about students being Breathalyzed on the streets and policemen waiting outside the doors of final clubs to catch inebriated students on the way out of a party. The crackdown aims, it appears, to shut down off-campus parties in order to tackle underage drinking, and to prevent students from visiting University Health Services for alcohol-related reasons. Authorities, however, are trying to solve the wrong problem and are missing the bigger picture. The far more important issue to address in Harvard’s off-campus social scene is female health and the need to protect and safeguard women from sexual assault. The Harvard University Police Department, the CPD, and—most importantly—the wider Harvard community should focus their energies more on preventing rape and harassment than on a fruitless attempt to head off underage drinking.
The recent reporting of two rapes on or near Harvard’s campus this summer shocked our community, especially since one of these actually occurred in Harvard Yard itself. According to one source, Harvard students are victims of 15 rapes per year on average. Think this is too high? So do we, particularly on a campus that many of us deem generally safe. Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds’ announcement that Harvard would increase security guards on duty as well as HUPD patrol in response to the two most recent rapes is welcome. Female health, however, seems hardly the principal focus of the visible display of increased law enforcement on campus these past two weekends. What’s more, underage drinking and the increased risk of rape should not be conflated; one does not naturally lead to the other. Law enforcement also does not alone lead to a safer environment for women on campus, even if police were to devote themselves to this problem. The fact remains that the vast majority of rapes on undergraduate campuses are not stranger rapes like those that dominated headlines at the beginning of this semester. An issue like the chronic under-reporting of rape by victims is as pressing as the need for better security in the Yard at night.
The police crackdown has done a lot to stifle Harvard’s nightlife over the past two weeks. Hopefully, the increasing intrusion of law enforcement in the lives of undergraduates will not continue in the long term. Life at Harvard is stressful as it is, and the last thing students need is to be Breathalyzed when just trying to relax on a Saturday evening. Traditionally, undergraduate and under-21 socializing at Harvard has taken place on campus or in off-campus private locations. While in many ways not enviable, this system has at least disincentivized many undergraduates from purchasing fake IDs, a chronic problem at many other colleges. This latest effort to stifle underage drinking will only limit the few recreational options that students under the age of 21 can attend on campus. Dining hall parties, while a positive force on campus, are not everyone’s first choice. Busting parties will likely only increase the relatively subdued presence of false identification on campus and push students into ever more dubious and perhaps rapid choices of how to get drunk. One thing is for sure, and that is underage students at Harvard, like their peers across the United States, will carry on drinking whether the police or the administration like it or not.

Starting this semester, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” office hours will be held in Annenberg to facilitate interaction between students and the course staff.
The course has also restructured its office hour process. Students will still “raise their hands” virtually through the click of the button, but the queuing system has been incorporated this year into the course’s discussion tool on its website, allowing students to use the same interface to ask questions whether or not they attend office hours.
The changes come after mixed reviews of CS50’s past office hours, which would rotate between the dining halls of Pforzheimer, Leverett, Quincy, and Lowell.
This year, students seeking aid will flock to the freshman dining hall, where they can find between 20 and 30 assigned teaching fellows and course assistants on Mondays through Thursdays from 8 p.m. to 11  p.m.
While other Harvard professors and teaching fellows have reported spending office hour sessions alone in their offices and classrooms, the numbers of students at CS50 office hours has taken off with the course’s rapid growth.
“Overall, the houses worked out wonderfully last year, thanks to the [House] Masters and HUDS.  But with peaks of 150 students on the busiest of nights, the dining halls would get a bit crowded, to the exclusion of some of the residents, which certainly wasn't our intention,” course instructor David J. Malan ’99 said.
Students said the large number of peers CS50 office hours attract has helped erase the stigma attached to asking for help.  At the same time, students pointed out the down sides to high attendance.
Caleb Q. Cook '15, who took CS50 last year, said that the one time he went to office hours, the sheer number of people limited the effectiveness of the entire process.
“The number of students was too much for the routers to handle. The internet kept going down for almost everybody,” Coo said.  “It was hard to really get help.”
Course staff members said they hope that that the new location will provide more flexibility and space for students.
“The hope is to decrease wait times for students by answering FAQs electronically so that we can more effectively help in person students who have more complex questions or would prefer one-on-one assistance,” Malan said.
Students said that the new changes have made it easier to navigate the process of seeking help.
“I think the centralized location is a good decision. Instead of having to look up the location every day, we always know where it is,” said Deborah B. Alves ’15, a CS50 teaching fellow who took the course last year.
“Moreover, a lot of the students in the course are freshmen, who will benefit greatly from Annenberg’s proximity to the Yard,” she added.
“For upperclassmen or students that live far away, it may be a little bit of a hindrance,” Cook said. “There’s always a trade-off.”

As Harvard College prepares for its second-ever Wintersession, offices from across the University have increased programming in the works, and the Undergraduate Council plans to streamline its funding processes for student groups.
Harvard offices planning events for Wintersession include the Office of Career Services, Department of Athletics, Center for Public Interest Careers, the Harvard Alumni Association, and Office for the Arts.
HAA plans to expand program offerings to Harvard Clubs around the world, including “career treks” and “winternships” that are planned jointly with the OCS.
HAA will also repeat the on-campus book talks and the Global Networking Night programs held last year, said Clint Ficula, Student Outreach Coordinator at HAA.
The OFA will offer several new programs, including a master class with Christine Ebersole, a Tony award-winning singer and actress, said Tom S. Lee, coordinator of OFA’s Learning From Performers series.
According to Lee, last year’s workshop with screenwriter and producer A. Carlton Cuse ’81 was especially popular. Lee said that the OFA hopes to add a different screenwriter or producer from Hollywood to its schedule in January 2013.
This year, the UC will work with the OSL to streamline approval of student-initiated programming. Last year, students were required to apply to the OSL for program approval and the UC for funding in separate processes, according to UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13. The new system will result in a more student-friendly process, he said.
UC funding decisions will continue to be made by students, not administrators, Bicknell said. The UC will distribute up to $20,000 in funding to student-initiated Wintersession programs, which is on par with 2012 funding levels, he added.
Wintersession program proposals from College students and other eligible members of the Harvard community must be submitted by December 10, according to an email from Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
For the first time, the UC will also provide organizational training to student program leaders to ensure that programs run smoothly, Bicknell said.
Cassandra E. Euphrat Weston ’14, current president of Harvard College Speak Out Loud, said that Wintersession offers a unique opportunity for student organizations to undertake projects that they may not have time for during the academic year. In January 2012, Euphrat Weston and then-co-president Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 planned a spoken word poetry performance with about fifteen participants.
The event was successful largely “because of the time everyone can commit to writing and putting on a show” during Wintersession, Euphrat Weston said. “It's also great because the first week that people are back there aren't a lot of events planned," which results in a larger audience, she said.
Lisa M. Boes, chair of the Winter Break committee and resident dean of Pforzheimer House, did not respond to requests for comment.
In an email to students on Thursday, Hammonds divided the intersession into three periods. Wintersession programming will run from Jan. 18 to 27. This period “provides opportunities to explore a creative passion, learn new ideas, develop a new skill, or delve into an extracurricular or career interest,” wrote Hammonds.
During the first session, the college will be closed to everyone except athletes and lab-based researchers. During the following session, from Jan. 2 to 17, students can apply to stay on campus for thesis research, athletics, and a variety of other reasons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Future Society discussed advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and the future of their group in the club’s first meeting of the school year on Friday.
Kevin V. Jain ’14, who founded the club two years ago as a freshman, said the club is currently grappling with its identity as it plans events and meetings for the coming semester.
In 2010, the Future Society helped to organize a Humanity+ Summit, which discusses the intersection of technology in advancing society and attracted more than 400 attendees and speakers from around the country. Since then, the club has had a smaller presence on campus—Friday’s meeting only drew eight students.
According to Jain, the goal of the club is to examine complicated questions about human existence moving forward, while also making the conversation “accessible” to those less well-versed in philosophy and the future of the universe.
During the meeting, Jain drew a diagram of the Six Epochs of Evolution—a progression that describes the world’s natural transition from unordered chaos to complex and orderly organizational structures. “We have to consider where we’re going to be in 10,000 years,” Jain said.
The members said that they plan to discuss questions of human advancement, transhumanism, and science in weekly or biweekly meetings, each with a specific focus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard urged students studying abroad in the Middle East and Northern Africa to take safety precautions in response to last week’s unrest in the Middle East and Northern Africa.
“Mob violence is the immediate concern,” read the email, sent by Harvard’s Global Support Services office. “But personnel also should be aware that singleton Islamic fanatics are more likely to lash out at individual Westerners at times like the present, and that any Westerner could be a target.”
The email was forwarded by the Office of Career Services to students studying abroad who “may face incidental and–conceivably–direct risks in the event of clashes between protesters and security personnel.”
The email was intended as a general warning and not in response to a specific threat to any Harvard affiliate, according to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.
Joseph Levy ’97, director of GSS, wrote in an email to The Crimson that “few Harvard students” are currently abroad and declined to comment on the number currently in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Levy declined a request for a phone interview.
In the email sent by GSS, the office told students to, among other things, “maintain a low profile, avoid sensitive topics of discussion, and avoid overt displays of nationality.”
OCS also advised that students update their information on the Harvard Travel Registry, which allows the University to keep track of students who may encounter danger while abroad.
Last week’s uprisings, which resulted in the death of the American ambassador to Libya along with other westerners, came in reaction to a film trailer insulting the prophet Mohammed. The video was produced in the United States and shared online.
Inanna L. Carter ’14, who is currently studying abroad in Kimana, Kenya, and described her location as “quite far from Northern Africa,” wrote in an email that she would not have known about any “unrest” if it had not had been for GSS’s message. Carter was traveling and could not be reached by phone.
According to Levy, GSS advises students to research the risks of their destinations prior to their departures. The office requires undergraduates to attend pre-departure orientations that go over safety suggestions for such things as medical care and traffic accidents.
Levy noted that students abroad should take precautions regardless of where they are traveling.
“Many of the precautions that are most important in North Africa right now are also important no matter where you go,” he wrote. “And we always caution students to avoid even seemingly peaceful protests, because they can turn violent without warning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team had just won its first game of the year over the University of San Diego, but that was hardly discussed in the ensuing press conference.
“I know the question everyone wants to ask,” Harvard coach Timothy L. Murphy said to the crowd—which stood larger than usual—early on in the press conference. “I’ll just answer it as best I can.”
Limited by privacy laws and a desire for team privacy, Murphy provided few specifics or details about the investigation into alleged cheating in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” class and its possible effect on the Harvard football team, but Murphy defended the character of his team as a whole.
Asked how many of the 119 players on the Harvard roster were on the sideline Saturday, Murphy responded, “A lot,” and later said he “obviously cannot” say how many people were unavailable for the season opener.
When reporters pressed Murphy about specific players who were not suited up Saturday, the coach said he was “not able to talk about kids who aren’t here.”
With multiple football players implicated in the scandal, Murphy understood the importance of fairly punishing any cheaters.
“Harvard kids aren’t good kids; they’re great kids,” Murphy said. “But they don’t walk on water. And I think it’s important as parents and educators that we have to reinforce that crucial life lesson that inappropriate behavior won’t be tolerated because down the road and later in life, those consequences can be terminal—can cost you a marriage, cost you a career.”
The College administration is currently investigating 125 students accused of collaborating on a take home final exam. Many athletes have come under scrutiny in the wake of the scandal. Both basketball co-captains Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13 have withdrawn from the College.
Senior running back Treavor S. Scales ’13, who had a career-high 173 yards rushing in the victory, said that the team handled any investigation-related adversity as it would handle any other challenge.
“Any adversity that comes your way, you put your head down, you bite down, and you grind through it,” Scales said. “We’ve had that mentality as a team. And distractions, adversity, whatever you call it, we powered through, and I’m proud of that.”
As for what the team was saying behind closed doors, Crimson captain Robert “Bobby” L. Schneider ’13 said the conversations were limited.
“To be honest with you, we don’t really talk about it,” Schneider said. “First of all, we can’t talk about specifics, as has been said. It’s not something we’re constantly thinking about. Obviously, there’s other people talking about it, be that as it may.”
On the field, the absence of players who chose to take a leave of absence to avoid disciplinary actions seemed to have a minimal effect, as the Crimson topped the San Diego Toreros 28-13 to start the year 1-0.
“We’re just going to keep going, keep pushing through,” Schneider continued “It’s not affecting us. We’ll be alright.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College administrators are bringing in extra help and shifting their priorities as they seek to balance new responsibilities stemming from Harvard’s sweeping cheating investigation with their normal job duties in University Hall.
The College was alerted to the massive academic integrity case last May, after assistant government professor Matthew B. Platt identified 13 suspicious final take-home exams in his spring course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Administrators spent the summer reviewing all 279 final exams submitted in the course, and had narrowed the investigation down to about 125 students by the time they announced the scandal publicly on Aug. 30.
Harvard has since brought in “fact finders” to aid with the investigation, Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement.
“As it sometimes does when circumstances warrant, the Administrative Board has engaged supplemental fact finders as additional resources so that these cases can be heard as promptly as possible,” Neal wrote.
In August, the College chose history lecturer Brett Flehinger, formerly the resident dean of Lowell House, to fill a recently-created administrative position addressing academic integrity.
At least one administrator has also redrawn her fall schedule partly in response to the cheating scandal. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds has cancelled History of Science 245: “The Changing Concept of Race in Science and Medicine in the United States: From Jefferson to Genomics,” the graduate seminar she had been slated to teach this fall, in part due to the cheating investigation, Neal wrote in a statement.
“Dean Hammonds is very disappointed that she won’t be able to offer her seminar this semester, as she had hoped and planned,” Neal wrote. “Unfortunately, her responsibilities as dean, including but not limited to the Administrative Board cases announced [on Aug. 30], will make it difficult for her to invest the time this semester that students in a class—particularly a seminar—deserve.”
Neal added that Hammonds hopes to teach the seminar in fall 2013.
The scandal also appears to have further delayed the release of a database of Ad Board statistics, which was originally expected to come out by the end of 2010.
In April, Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison told The Crimson that he expected the first part of the planned database, which would summarize past academic integrity cases, by the end of last academic year. But that database has yet to come out, and Neal did not provide a definite timeframe for its release.
“The first priority of the Administrative Board is to work with students to resolve cases before the board,” Neal wrote in an emailed statement. “Once those cases are resolved, the board can turn its attention back to longer-term projects.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who studies higher education law, said he thinks the sheer volume of the scandal places administrators under “tremendous pressure” to avoid mistakes, a task which will require a significant amount of time.
Lake estimated that administrators may dedicate more than fifty hours to each implicated student’s case, a total he predicted could add up to “essentially one administrator’s entire year of energy.”
Administrators have not indicated a timeline for when they will resolve the more than 100 cases connected to the scandal, but one student under investigation said he had been told by Ellison that he could expect a decision by November at the latest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many students fled from parties this weekend, after Cambridge police officers showed up at final club parties and asked club officials to keep the noise down.
On Friday night, Cambridge police officers interrupted a party at the Phoenix. Officers also arrived at parties at the Owl and the Delphic on Saturday night to ask that music be turned down.
One sophomore, granted anonymity by The Crimson because she was afraid to be associated with a party that had been interrupted by police, was at the Delphic Saturday night when the police arrived. Along with many other partygoers, the sophomore exited the club once aware of the police and was surprised by the extent of the police presence outside.
“It looked like every time I turned around, there was another cop car,” she said. “They were everywhere.”
She said that students’ heightened cautiousness of police presence may be because of the ease with which information can be found online.
“I think definitely in the digital age...no one wants to get in trouble with the police,” she said. “Everyone at Harvard is very career-minded. No one likes the cops.”
According to her, after word of the interruption spread, a few students shouted phrases like “fuck the police” and “it’s the 5-0,” a common slang for the police, while they made their way out the front door.
Another sophomore, who was also granted anonymity by The Crimson for fear of being implicated for attending the party, said she believes the student body has grown frustrated and worried about the perceived increase in police intervention.
“I think it’s definitely making people a lot more cautious and worried about going out,” she said. “I think people are just trying to be more careful and stay out of trouble.”
But as students become increasingly wary of police interference on campus, a sophomore male, granted anonymity by The Crimson because he too feared implication with the party, said that final club life may become restricted to members only—a move that he worries may make the Harvard social scene even more exclusive.
“Harvard social life is already pretty exclusive,” he said. “I feel like the stricter rules are trying to take something that’s already not great at Harvard...and make it even less accessible—and that’s the last thing that we need as a school.”
In the two weeks since the semester began, similar encounters with the Cambridge Police Department have led many students to fear that these two weekends represent a new trend for campus social life.
The anonymous sophomore male said that the recent crackdowns by CPD have frustrated him and his friends, who were looking forward to being punched by these clubs this year.
“We were excited for sophomore year, because we could finally be part of the clubs,” he said.
Another of the students wondered how the freshmen’s experience with part of the Harvard social scene would be affected.
“It was sad,” she said. “Usually the first week of school is fun. This year it was sort of dead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Colton Chapple’s four starts for the Harvard football team were all about the pass. The then-junior, who went undefeated filling in for the injured Collier Winters ’11, became the first player in Crimson history to throw for four touchdowns in back-to-back games and the second to throw for five scores in a contest.
But on Saturday, as Chapple struggled with his accuracy in his first game as the team’s number one quarterback, it was the run that led Harvard to a 28-13 win.
Senior running back Treavor Scales had a career day on the ground, rushing for 173 yards on just 19 carries and two touchdowns. After he collected 54 yards in the first half—most of his attempts coming on delays with Chapple in the shotgun—Scales scored both of his touchdowns in the final quarter, when the Crimson’s 21 unanswered points gave the team its 10th straight win dating back to last season.
On Harvard’s first drive of the fourth, the senior scampered for 28 yards to help set up a Chapple touchdown pass to senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk that gave Harvard the lead.
On the next Crimson possession, Harvard had the ball in the red zone looking to widen its advantage. A 10-yard dash by Scales brought the ball to the two, and after a one-yard Scales rush, Chapple ran the option to perfection, pitching the ball back to his running back who scored untouched to put Harvard up by eight.
Later, at the 4:27 mark of the fourth, the Crimson had possession at its own 34 with the chance to run down the clock and ice the contest.
“Colton came into the huddle, called ‘Power,’ and he said, ‘Guys, one first down, and we got the game,’” Scales said. “And I looked at him in his face and said, ‘No, we’re scoring a touchdown.’”
And that was exactly what the halfback did, exploding through a hole on the right side and surging 66 yards into the end zone.
“The offensive line did a heck of a job blocking,” Scales said. “It opened up like the Red Sea, and I had no choice. I was obligated to get to that end zone when it opens up like that.”
PENAL LAW
Last year, the Crimson committed the third most penalties in the Ancient Eight, and that trend continued on Saturday when Harvard earned eight flags that cost it a total of 66 yards.
The largest of those infractions came late in the third quarter. Following a San Diego touchdown that gave it a 13-7 lead, sophomore Seitu Smith II returned the subsequent kickoff to the house to put the Crimson back ahead and swing the momentum to the home team. But the touchdown was called back thanks to a holding penalty on junior tight end Cameron Brate, forcing Harvard to not only lose the points but also to have to start its subsequent drive at its own six.
Though they did not have as direct an impact, a number of other penalties hurt the team throughout the rest of the game.
With the Crimson nearing midfield early in the second quarter, sophomore left tackle Anthony Fabiano, making his first career start, committed a personal foul penalty that turned a 2nd and 9 into a 2nd and 24, essentially killing the drive.
On its next possession, Harvard was facing a 3rd and 3 when senior Rich Zajeski picked up the first down on a four-yard rush. But a holding penalty on Juszczyk negated the first and pushed the Crimson back into its own territory, and the team had to punt following an incompletion.
Then, on Harvard’s opening drive of the second half, a false start and another Fabiano personal foul quickly turned a 2nd and 6 into a 3rd and 19.
“There’s no excuse,” Murphy said. “We talked about it coming in that our style of football is make people beat us, don’t beat ourselves.... Sometimes you get an aggressive penalty, but today they were completely unnecessary, really put us behind on two drives in the first half, and we will address it.”
NO JOSUE? THAT’S OKAY
Following the graduation of Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Josue Ortiz ’11, one of the biggest questions facing the Harvard defense coming into the season was how it would replicate the pressure generated by the defensive tackle, who had a league-high 10 sacks last season.
But while the secondary notably struggled in the absences of graduated star cornerback Matthew Hanson ’12 and injured number one corner Brian Owusu—allowing 12 catches and 135 yards to San Diego wideout Brandon White—the defensive line looked like it hadn’t missed a beat from last year, when it helped Harvard lead the league in rush defense and sacks.
The Crimson had Toreros quarterback Mason Mills under heavy pressure all afternoon, sacking him six times. Sophomore Zach Hodges and senior John Lyon each collected two sacks that went for a combined 30 yards in losses.
“Lyon’s [sacks] are more of an effort thing,” Murphy said. “Zach’s got some really special ability to change direction and rush the passer.”
The Crimson also held Toreros’ running backs Joe Ferguson and Kenn James to just 36 yards, forcing Mills into 63 passing attempts.
“There’s nothing better as a linebacker,” captain Bobby Schneider said. “It was exactly what we want from those guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fire up the grill, start up your games of cornhole, and get tailgating because it’s officially football season in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It might be hard to remember because we don’t treat our quarterbacks like this, but yes, Harvard has a football team. A pretty dang good football team if we do say so ourselves.
All right, so maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves after one game. On Saturday, the No. 24 football team won its home opener against the Toreros from the University of San Diego. The Crimson boasts a 1-0 record, which is more than the highly touted Arkansas Razorbacks can say for themselves.
The jury is still out as to whether that means Harvard could take on Arkansas, but we’re going to enjoy this win. To commemorate the first victory of the year, we’ve compiled our favorite tweets of the week from some Harvard football players.
1) Jack Dittmer wants shorter classes. This week, the junior defensive end complained to his followers about class length:
"Classes that last longer than an hour lose me every time... ‪#whatsthepointscott"
Sorry to break it to you, Jack, but classes don’t really get much shorter than that.  How long is good for you, thirty minutes? Why don’t you try this, pretend class is a football meeting that lasts longer than an hour. That is, assuming you think there is a point to football meetings that last longer than an hour.
2) Dittmer’s teammate, Chris Splinter, does not share the same animosity towards his class schedule. The junior defensive back raved about his Tuesday-Thursday lineup on Twitter:
"Definitely cant complain about only having one class on tuesday and thursday ‪#itsahaloafternoon"
We couldn’t figure out if Halo counts for a Gen Ed or if it’s in the Computer Science department.  If Dittmer had this schedule and the class lasted two hours, would he be able to handle Tuesdays and Thursdays?
3) It appears that sophomore wide receiver Ryan Simpson has been people-watching.  Simpson appeared disappointed with at least one of his peers:
"That's what u r wearing to class today?? I thought that was Ur walk of shame... ‪#whatarepeoplethinking"
Due to the use of letters instead of full words, it is unclear how many people committed fashion faux pas. We suggest an Instagram next time, Ryan, so that peer pressure can fulfill your dream of a better-dressed student body.
Those are your Tweets of the Week. If the football team cuts its meetings to shorter than an hour, well, you know the real reason.  Regardless, the Crimson appear to be in great form, both on the field and on the web.

As Harvard wound down for the summer, some of its bigger basketball names were just getting started with an offseason full of travel, new cities, and new jerseys. Crimson players showed off their talents for teams ranging from Great Britain to the Dallas Mavericks, playing in three different nations along the way. Here are The Back Page’s top travel-centric basketball moments of the summer.
4. In basketball, shooting from long distance usually means beyond the three-point line. The Harvard men’s basketball team, though, took it a step further when they went to Italy to play four preseason exhibition games. The squad went 4-0 on the trip, collecting solid efforts from sophomores Wes Sanders and Kenyatta Smith. With the completion of this trip, the team gave a whole new meaning to “going coast to coast.”
Total miles the men’s team traveled to play: 3,824.
3. While his former teammates jetted East, Keith Wright ’12 went west to pursue his hoops dreams. Upon signing with the Mavericks’ summer league team, Wright played five games in the NBA Summer League, averaging 3.4 points and 2.8 rebounds in 12.0 minutes of playing time. He earned an efficiency rating of +3.60, helping his team go 4-1. But for Wright, the journey has temporarily ended there, as the Mavs did not sign him onto their regular-season roster.
Total miles Wright traveled to play: 2,716.
2. Despite being deemed ineligible her freshman collegiate season due to NCAA rulings, sophomore Temi Fagbenle did more than just finally get on the hardwood this summer—Fagbenle was one of 12 players selected to play for Great Britain’s national team for the 2012 Olympics. Despite the team’s 0-5 record during pool play, Fagbenle played an average of 20 minutes per game, recording 4.8 ppg, 1.2 bpg, and 4.0 rpg.
Total miles Fagbenle traveled to play: 3,250.
1. Once the dust of Linsanity settled down, Jeremy Lin ’10 found himself in the throes of free agency. Amidst rumors from both the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets camp, Lin finally signed an offer sheet with the latter team, worth roughly $30 million for four years of play. After the ensuing drama caused largely by a disgruntled Knicks organization, Lin found himself packing his bags and moving to Houston for the next leg of his basketball career.
Total miles Lin will travel to play: 1,419.
Who said traveling in basketball was a bad thing?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a string of three losses at last weekend’s Princeton Invitational, Harvard men’s water polo rebounded in its return to Cambridge and home-pool play, recording two wins and one loss at the North-South Challenge.
The Crimson split its matchups on Saturday, falling to Bucknell, 11-3, before taking down Mercyhurst, 16-9, later that afternoon. Harvard then closed the weekend at Blodgett Pool with a 15-13 victory over George Washington on Sunday.
The Crimson (5-5), whose roster includes only five upperclassmen, saw major contributions from rookies including Ben Zepfel and Blake Lee, who notched four goals apiece on Sunday.
“We played some of our better water polo of the year this weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We’ve definitely been getting consistently better every week.”
But with such a young roster, the coach gives credit to the team’s returners for bringing the squad together to get the weekend’s two wins.
“The great thing about the juniors and seniors is that they’re all leaders,” Minnis said. “They all lead in their own way. It starts at the top with our senior captain Max Eliot and our junior captain Will Roller. They do a great job of being vocal leaders and really leading by example.
“I think that’s huge, and what they do can’t be underestimated,” Minnis added.
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 13
With Lee and Zepfel leading the way on offense on Sunday, the Crimson was closed out the last game of the weekend despite being tied with the Colonials (5-6) at six at the half and then again at 10 going into the final frame.
The teams traded goals in the first few minutes of the fourth period, but a pair of back-to-back ejections resulted in scores from Roller and freshman Noah Harrison to pull ahead. A final goal from yet another rookie, Robbie Fluegge, increased the margin, allowing Harvard to take the game, 15-13.
“[The freshmen] showed that they’re a very talented group,” Minnis said. “All the hard work that [we’ve] put in on recruiting has paid off.... Everyone’s starting to get to know each other better, and it’s showing up in the pool.”
HARVARD 16, MERCYHURST 9
The Crimson’s offense was equally proficient in Saturday’s matchup against the Lakers, jumping to a 5-1 lead in the game’s opening frame. But Harvard’s goal-scoring success was anchored in strong play at the opposite end of the pool.
“We played really well on the defensive end against Mercyhurst, and that got our counterattack going,” Minnis said. “That led to a couple of easy goals, and really got our confidence going.”
Harrison, who was named the CWPA Northern Division Rookie of the Week earlier this month, tallied five of the Crimson’s 14 total steals against the Lakers (6-2, 4-0 CWPA), and junior goalie Jimmy Field contributed 18 saves, giving him a season total of 56.
With its defense shutting down Mercyhurst’s attacks, the Harvard offense went to work, and seven different Crimson players recorded goals before the final whistle.
“When we played Mercyhurst, we came out with guns blazing. We came out firing. We were...all pretty fired up,” Zepfel said.
BUCKNELL 11, HARVARD 3
In Saturday’s first matchup, Harvard found itself on the less favorable side of an early-game deficit.
The Bison (4-5), who also participated—but did not face the Crimson—in the Princeton Invitational last weekend, rallied in the first two periods, building up a comfortable margin.
“We had a tough first half against Bucknell,” Minnis said. “We were down 5-0 at the half, and we just really couldn’t recover from that.”
The Bison defense ensured any Harvard comeback would have to wait until later in the match, as Bucknell goalie Matt Napleton kept the Crimson scoreless for more than 16 minutes to open the game.
Harvard was finally able to put the ball in the back of the net in the third quarter, but the Bison responded with six more goals in the second half, putting the game well out of the Crimson’s reach.
Despite the early loss to Bucknell, the wins against Mercyhurst and George Washington bode well for Harvard going into conference play this upcoming weekend.
“The big thing is that we got the home opener out of the way,” Minnis said. “We’ve been on the road. We’ve lost some games. We’ve won some games. We’ve played in some blowout games. And we’ve been blown out in some blowout games. I think those are all real positives to have going into conference play.”
The Crimson will travel across Cambridge to face local rival MIT in its conference opener on Sept. 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was nearly déjà vu all over again for the Harvard football team.
In its first game in 2011, a strong Crimson squad with high expectations met a weaker Holy Cross team coming into its third contest of the season. And what happened? Sloppy play from the Crimson doomed it to a 30-22 loss.
Fast forward to Saturday’s season opener. Through three quarters, Harvard was trailing, 13-7, against a San Diego team that—yes—was in its third contest of the season too.
Once again, the Crimson was beating itself. Harvard was giving away penalty yardage like it was tax-deductible. Quarterback Colton Chapple, whose laser precision in 2011 landed him in the Crimson record books, was doing something we didn’t see much at all last season: missing receivers, and at times, missing badly (though a strong wind didn’t help).
For a second, it looked like the script for the game was copied from the 2011 version. 2012’s season opener was quickly becoming the “Hangover 2” to 2011’s “Hangover.” Yes, it took place in a different spot. And fine, it may have had different antagonists. But in the end, the story was, well, the same: Sloppiness and rust end the quest for a perfect season as soon as it starts.
But finally, in the fourth, an alternate ending emerged.
Because the Harvard offense, with just 15 minutes to spare, finally awoke from that 10-month slumber. After hitting the snooze button for the first 45 minutes of action, the Crimson attack—with help from some tangible adjustments from the coaching staff—finally rolled out of bed and showed up at Harvard Stadium.
And one quarter later, 21 points later, Harvard had run away with it. If you look at the final score—28-13—it doesn’t even look that close. The Crimson emphatically shut the door at game one, extending its winning streak to 10 games dating back to—you guessed it—its Week 1 loss to Holy Cross a year ago.
What sparked the sudden about-face for the Crimson? Interestingly enough, it arrived after what might have turned out to be one of the afternoon’s more disheartening plays, a play that would have been the subject of countless “what-ifs” if the Crimson’s “W” had instead been an “L.”
With under two minutes remaining in the third quarter, San Diego had just taken the 13-7 lead. Then, on the subsequent kickoff, sophomore Seitu Smith II did what he does best: run and run and run, from the one-yard line all the way into the Toreros end zone for the touchdown.
Or, more precisely, what appeared to be a touchdown.
A holding call against Harvard brought the play all the way back to the Crimson six. What was supposed to be a lead-changer instead pinned Harvard deep within its own territory, 94 yards away from the San Diego end zone.
And so, everyone braced for another quick three-and-out from Harvard, which only just cracked 100 yards of total offense in the first half. One drive to go 94 yards? Might as well have been to Istanbul.
But that’s when something clicked for Harvard. Senior running back Treavor Scales found his stride. Chapple looked more like his old 2011 self (though he later threw what could have been a costly interception on the next drive). And with that, in conjunction with some careless San Diego penalties, Harvard marched down the field in just over three minutes and held the lead for the rest of the affair.
“Looking back after the kickoff return was negated, as a coach, you’re happy it happened,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I certainly wasn’t happy it happened at the time. We had to show a little bit of stuff, we had to show a little bit of resiliency, and I thought our kids really kept their poise and really played their best after that point.”
Now, though, comes the real question, the one that frightens and excites players and coaches alike.  For the next nine games, which offense will show up? Is it the one from the first three quarters, the one with the horsepower of a mid-80s Kia? Or is it last year’s Hummer, which bulldozed everyone and everything in its path en route to an average of nearly 40 points per game?
Such are the questions and unknowns that are the exclusive purview of early-season contests. And as for the answers? Well, those may not come for a while.
But one thing is clear: If the offense is asleep at the wheel in future games for three quarters, even if the fourth quarter is a masterpiece like it was on Saturday, that 10-game winning streak might become a thing of the past very soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first competition of the 2012-13 season, the Harvard women’s tennis team saw promising performances from a number of its newest members.
Rookies Amanda Lin and Crystal Yen, competing in their first collegiate contests, took first place in the C and D flights, respectively, at the Columbia Invitational in New York over the weekend.
“Now they have at least one tournament under their belt, so that they can have some experience and understand what it’s like at this level,” said co-captain Hideko Tachibana, who, along with fellow co-captain Kristin Norton, fell in the finals of the doubles A Flight . “Next time around, it’ll be easier for them, and it can only go uphill from here.”
After notching a pair of early wins to advance to the finals, Tachibana and Norton met Columbia’s Tiana Takenaga and Bianca Sanon, falling, 8-6.
“We held up well but just came up a bit short,” Tachibana said. “We put a really big front out there.... This loss will make us work harder,  and now we can figure out what we need to do to be more successful.”
Lin and Yen had more success, as each went undefeated at the Invitational. In the C Flight, it was Crimson versus Crimson in the final, as Lin took on sophomore Sylvia Li.
The competition between teammates yielded a very close match that ultimately resulted in a Lin victory, 6-4, 7-5.
Yen also came out on top, notching a 6-3, 6-2 win over Columbia’s Tiana Takenaga in the singles D Flight.
“We did a really great job this weekend,” coach Traci Green said. “We competed well, and we can only keep getting better and better. Our goal coming into the invitational was to advance to the next level of the matches and feel accomplished.”
The Invitational featured players from the Crimson, St. John’s, Binghamton, Fairfield, UMass, Penn, and Columbia and consisted of four separate singles brackets and two doubles brackets.
Aside from Lin and Yen, freshman Amy He and junior Natalie Blosser made it to singles quarterfinals in bracket B.
“We all came back from the summer and worked hard for the past two weeks trying to get into shape as a whole,” said Blosser, who fell to Columbia’s Kanika Vaidya. “We worked on fitness and stressed incorporating the new freshmen. After being away for the entire summer, our core objective was to get the team unity back together. We still have lots of work to do, though. Columbia showed strongly this weekend, so we need to sharpen our game a bit.”
In the singles A Flight, Norton reached the semifinals where she fell to Columbia’s Nicole Bartnik.
Tachibana was eliminated in the quarterfinals by UMass’s Yuliana Motyl.
With the start of the Ivy League competition a few weeks away, the Crimson’s performance was crucial as a means of preparing for the coming season.
“I’m excited for the fall season,” Green said. “I saw lots of good things out on the court and we will get better together because there’s a lot of heart on our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading up to Friday’s annual Harvard-Yale dual cross country meet, it appeared as if neither school held a significant advantage over the other. With the Crimson and the Bulldogs near each other in the rankings, few expected either to pull off a resounding victory.
But those expectations failed to come to fruition, as the Harvard men and Yale women proved to be too much for their opponents and cruised to team victories.
On the men’s side, led by an experienced trio who finished in the top-three spots at the meet, Harvard toppled Yale, 21-38. But the Bulldogs turned the tables in the women’s race, placing six runners in the top seven to earn a 19-40 victory.
Running their first full eight-kilometer race of the season, the Crimson’s most experienced competitors displayed why the squad could make some waves in the Ivy League this year. Juniors Maksim Korolev and James Leakos and senior Jakob Lindaas turned in a one-two-three finish on Friday at the Yale Golf Course.
“The guys up front did a tremendous job by going one-two-three and really demonstrated that they’re just at a different level,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
Saretsky indicated that his original plan was for his top runners to allow the Yale harriers to set the pace in the early stages of Friday’s race. But when it became apparent that Yale had the same intentions, that burden rested on the shoulders of Korolev, Leakos, and Lindaas.
“I was kind of hoping that they would be able to tuck in and seal things up for a while,” Saretksy said. “But they didn’t panic. I think in years past, they might have tried to push on right from the get-go to shake things up. They did a great job of running a controlled effort and…just letting the race naturally heat up.”
Down the stretch, the Bulldogs were unable to match the pace set by the Crimson trio. One by one, the Yale runners fell back until a pack of just four led the way. Korolev passed Leakos in the final sprint to earn the individual title in 24:20.29, and Lindaas edged out Bulldog senior Kevin Lunn for third place as he finished in 24:34.29.
“When it was time to go, they put the hammer down,” Saretsky said.
Perhaps equally impressive for the Harvard men on Friday was the apparent depth of its roster. Finishing behind Yale’s Lunn were teammates Demetri Goutos and Matthew Nussbaum, who were then followed by the Crimson’s fourth through seventh finishers. The squad’s seventh runner, sophomore Will Geiken, crossed the finish line in 25:20.95 to give Harvard an impressive one-minute spread from its first to seventh finishers.
The Harvard women were similarly packed up in Friday’s race but were unable to break up a five-runner group that gave Yale its decisive victory.
Bulldog junior Liana Epstein took home the individual title, covering the five-kilometer course in 17:24.78. She was just ahead of Crimson senior Samantha Silva, who finished with a time of 17:25.58.
For the first 2.5 miles of the race, Silva and teammate junior Emily Reese joined four Yale runners in the lead pack. But with just half a mile to go, the pack began to dwindle until only Silva and two Bulldogs remained.  The senior was able to shake off third-place Nihal Kayali, but could not catch Epstein in the final stretch.
“I waited too long to start my kick,” Silva said. “There just wasn’t enough course left by the time I started getting close.”
Crossing the finish line after Silva were five consecutive Bulldogs, and then Harvard’s remaining four scoring runners.
In spite of the squad’s wide margin of defeat, Saretsky was pleased with the way his team performed.
“I think the results are a little bit deceptive,” he said. “We actually performed well…. It’s a tough 5k course, and if you look at the times, all of our first five ran faster than our first runner [at the Nassaney Invitational last weekend].”
The team’s top finisher at the Nassaney Invitational, senior Briana Jackucewicz, was third for the Crimson on Friday and ninth overall. Reese led the pack of four Harvard runners that all crossed the finish line in a 14-second span.
“As a collective group, we’ve got an outstanding women’s team,” Saretsky said. “And they’re only going to get better week in and week out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first tournament of the 2012-13 season, the Harvard men’s golf team came out strong, finishing in a tie for second place after one round of the McLaughlin tournament held at the Bethpage Red Course in Farmingdale, N.Y.
But that was the closest the Crimson came to the lead, as Harvard finished in 11th place out of the 16 teams competing throughout the weekend, with an overall team score of 872 strokes, 32 strokes over par.
Auburn led the tournament, which was hosted by St. John’s, with 830 strokes, at ten under par, as freshman Jake Mondy and senior Michael Hebert were the top two scorers on the weekend at -8 and -6, respectively.
The Tigers were 11 strokes ahead of second-place Louisville and 28 strokes ahead of third-place Johnson and Wales (Fla.). The Crimson was 42 strokes behind the victor.
“This was a very good field—probably one of the best that there’s been at this tournament in years,” sophomore Seiji Liu said. “Definitely all the teams have gotten a lot deeper.… Backing ourselves against these players is great for us to develop as a team.”
Junior captain Theo Lederhausen was the top scorer for the Crimson, finishing in a tie for 26th place with 216 strokes, six over par. He also had the low round of the weekend for Harvard with his opening score of 68.
Liu was the Crimson’s second-best finisher, posting a +8, good for 36th place, while junior Kevin McCarthy closely followed with a score of 219, putting him in a tie for 44th place.
Sophomore Akash Mirchandani completed the team scoring for Harvard with a 51st-place finish and a +11.
Junior Michael Lai also competed and earned a score of 228 strokes as an individual, putting him in a tie for 71st.
Through the windy conditions and hard greens, the Crimson was able to surpass Columbia–who finished in 15th–but was bested by Ivy League rivals Dartmouth and Princeton, which finished in ties for fifth and eighth place, respectively.
After one round of play, Harvard found itself six strokes off the lead in a tie for second place with Johnson and Wales at +5. Auburn led the pack with a score of 279.
Lederhausen led the Crimson with a score of 68, tied for third best overall in the opening round.  Only Wildcat junior Jason Harris and Mondy had better scores, with scores of 66 and 67, respectively.
“I putted pretty well all weekend, which was important for me because I wasn’t hitting it great. I was chipping and putting well, which is a good sign going forward.”
Second best for Harvard was Liu, who was tied for 10th with 70 strokes.
McCarthy and Mirchandani rounded up the scoring for the Crimson with 72 and 75 strokes, respectively. Junior Michael Lai finished with a score of 79 in round one.
After the first round, the Crimson led all Ivy League rivals, leading the Big Green by seven, the Tigers by eight, and the Lions by nine. Though several teams finished their second rounds on Saturday, play was eventually postponed due to darkness.
“It was very grueling playing 36 holes in the first [day] and finishing basically in darkness,” Liu said. “So I think our team’s mental strength has improved a lot, and that’s something I really worked on to improve as the season has begun.”
The remaining holes of the second round were played early Sunday morning, after which Harvard found itself trailing leader Auburn by 25 strokes, finishing with 579 strokes at +19, tied for sixth place with Binghamton and Loyola Marymount.
McCarthy displayed consistency in the second round with another score of 72, the Crimson’s best for the round, placing him in a tie for 22nd place.
Liu followed up with a 73, putting him in a tie for 16th place with Lederhausen, who shot a 75 in his second round, moving his total score up to 143 strokes on the weekend.
Mirchandani improved in the second round, shooting a 74, while Lai completed the scoring for Harvard with 76 strokes.
Under recently named head coach Kevin Rhoads, who has coached the women’s squad for eight years, the Crimson will look to improve in the coming weeks of the fall season.
“I think that the steps that they’ve taken are leading us in the right direction,” Liu said. “It’s too soon to tell, but I think that it’s definitely a positive at the moment. But it’s obviously going to take some time to see the results of this change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a string of three losses at last weekend’s Princeton Invitational, the Harvard men’s water polo team rebounded in its return to Cambridge and home-pool play, recording two wins and one loss at the North-South Challenge.
The Crimson split its matchups on Saturday, falling to Bucknell, 11-3, before taking down Mercyhurst, 16-9, later that afternoon. Harvard then closed the weekend at Blodgett Pool with a 15-13 victory over George Washington on Sunday.
The Crimson (5-5), whose roster includes only five upperclassmen, saw major contributions from rookies including Ben Zepfel and Blake Lee, who notched four goals apiece on Sunday.
“We played some of our better water polo of the year this weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We’ve definitely been getting consistently better every week.”
But with such a young roster, the coach gives credit to the team’s returners for bringing the squad together to get the weekend’s two wins.
“The great thing about the juniors and seniors is that they’re all leaders,” Minnis said. “They all lead in their own way. It starts at the top with our senior captain Max Eliot and our junior captain Will Roller. They do a great job of being vocal leaders and really leading by example.... I think that’s huge, and what they do can’t be underestimated.”
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 13
With Lee and Zepfel leading the way on offense on Sunday, the Crimson closed out the last game of the weekend with a win after being tied with the Colonials (5-6) at six at the half and then again at 10 going into the final frame.
The teams traded goals in the first few minutes of the fourth period, but a pair of back-to-back ejections resulted in scores from Roller and freshman Noah Harrison to pull ahead. A final goal from yet another rookie, Robbie Fluegge, increased the margin, allowing Harvard to take the game, 15-13.
“[The freshmen] showed that they’re a very talented group,” Minnis said. “All the hard work that [we’ve] put in on recruiting has paid off…. Everyone’s starting to get to know each other better, and it’s showing up in the pool.”
HARVARD 16, MERCYHURST 9
The Crimson’s offense was equally proficient in Saturday’s matchup against the Lakers, jumping to a 5-1 lead in the game’s opening frame. But Harvard’s goal-scoring success was anchored in strong play at the opposite end of the pool.
“We played really well on the defensive end against Mercyhurst, and that got our counterattack going,” Minnis said. “That led to a couple of easy goals and really got our confidence going.”
Harrison, who was named the CWPA Northern Division Rookie of the Week earlier this month, tallied five of the Crimson’s 14 total steals against the Lakers (6-2, 4-0 CWPA), and junior goalie Jimmy Field contributed 18 saves, giving him a season total of 56.
With its defense shutting down Mercyhurst’s attacks, the Harvard offense went to work, and seven different Crimson players recorded goals before the final whistle.
“When we played Mercyhurst, we came out with guns blazing,” Zepfel said. “We came out firing. We were…all pretty fired up.”
BUCKNELL 11, HARVARD 3
In Saturday’s first matchup, Harvard found itself facing an early deficit.
The Bison (4-5), who also participated—but did not face the Crimson—in the Princeton Invitational last weekend, rallied in the first two periods, building up a comfortable margin.
“We had a tough first half against Bucknell,” Minnis said. “We were down 5-0 at the half, and we just really couldn’t recover from that.”
The Bison defense ensured any Harvard comeback would have to wait until later in the match, as Bucknell goalie Matt Napleton kept the Crimson scoreless for more than 16 minutes to open the game.
Harvard was finally able to put the ball in the back of the net in the third quarter, but the Bison responded with six more goals in the second half, putting the game well out of the Crimson’s reach.
Despite the early loss to Bucknell, the wins against Mercyhurst and George Washington bode well for Harvard going into conference play, which begins this upcoming weekend.
“The big thing is that we got the home opener out of the way,” Minnis said. “We’ve been on the road. We’ve lost some games. We’ve won some games. We’ve played in some blowout games. And we’ve been blown out in some blowout games. I think those are all real positives to have going into conference play.”
The Crimson will travel across Cambridge to face local rival MIT in its conference opener on Sept. 21.

Teasing signs were placed along the corridors of Cabot. Emails were sent to house lists, referencing a revamped, fresh space. What was all the fuss about? Cabot Café, of course!
As of 9:00 p.m. last night, Cabot Café officially opened for the semester. With its warm-colored walls, retro-style lights, and bookshelf full of games, Cabot Café remains an inviting place for students to come socialize, study, or just grab a drink and a dessert.
Cabot Café is open 9:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m., Sunday through Thursday. Hot drinks, cold drinks, frozen drinks, and desserts among other things are served.
As one of the founders and current manager of the Café, Jesse J. Kaplan '13 said, Cabot Café provides "escape." "Escape from the intensity of most Harvard places."
Seeing as it's all the way in the Quad, we can't disagree with that!

Mitt Romney announced on June 2, 2011. President Obama declared a couple months earlier on April 4. The first candidate for this month's Undergraduate Council elections made public his intentions nearly a month before even arriving on campus, on August 4, 2012.
Though declarations for the UC's general elections were due last Friday, Sept. 14 at noon, some ambitious members of the Class of 2016 took a cue from this year's Presidential candidates and tried to get their names out on Facebook early in the season.
"Is anyone else considering running for student government?" one freshman posted to the Class of 2016 group. "I know that elections take place only a few weeks into the term, so was wondering how other students were preparing...if, that is, you're preparing at all!"
Rory O'Reilly '16 replied minutes later, "Definitely interested. My plan is to take out the other competitors."
Though another member of the group suggested that he run with the tagline "The O'Reilly Factor," O'Reilly offered up a campaign slogan of his own: "Vote for Rory, End of Story."
Although that first eager freshman candidate has since decided not to run, O'Reilly still has eyes on the big election. In fact, he is using his "Vote for Rory" tagline.
"The tagline has carried me as my school's class president for 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade; I'd rather spend time thinking of ways to help my peers as opposed to thinking of new catch phrases—because the class of 2016 deserves my love and attention," wrote O'Reilly in an email.
Will Rory claim glory, end of story? Campaigning began today at noon, and voting opens Wednesday. A full list of candidates and platforms can be found on the UC's website. Election results will be posted Friday evening.

"It hit me after graduating from Harvard," Tyra Banks explained in the opening sequence of America's Next Top Model's 19th cycle this summer. "We just have to do a college cycle!"
To be clear, Tyra did not attend the College, though her feisty sidekick in that opening scene is quick to compliment her "big, fierce, Harvard College ideas!" Since "graduating" from Harvard Business School last February (in fact, Banks received a certificate from Harvard's Owner/President Management Program, a nine-week program featuring an application which asks prospective participants for their annual compensations but does not inquire about GPAs or test scores) Banks has not missed a single opportunity to drop the H-Bomb, reminding the world time and time again of all that deliberately-assigned hard work she had to put in.
And yet, as Jezebel's Jenna Sauers boldly explained, Tyra Banks does not have any kind of Harvard degree at all.
Still, most of Tyra's minions are willing to brush this technicality aside if it means they can invoke Harvard in reference to her. In the most recently aired episode of ANTM, contestant Maria Tucker, who received a master's degree last spring from Harvard Divinity School, decided that modeling was not for her and chose to withdraw from the competition. In a heart-to-heart with stylist-to-the-stars Johnny Wujek, Wujek encouraged Tucker to stick it out for Tyra's sake. "Tyra's a big fan," he told Tucker. "You're a Harvard girl!"
After all, Tyra should know all about Harvard girls. As she explained on Good Morning America, her forced 3-week stay in HBS dorms ("When they told me that I'd have to be in the dorms, I was like, wait, there's a hotel two blocks away. Can I stay there?") helped her connect with her classmates. "I have bonded with these people," Banks stated. And since Harvard is really just one big undifferentiated pajama party of studying people held captive in their dorms, it's entirely possible she roomed with Tucker herself.
