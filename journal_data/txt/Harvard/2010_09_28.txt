After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A major concern within the contemporary art world: if only the works of a few artists are ever displayed, how can cultural institutions promote innovation and creativity? The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston hopes it has the answer to this question—every two years, bring in totally new faces.
Amie Siegel, a professor on leave in the Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) department, is currently a finalist for the James and Audrey Foster Prize, a biennial grant awarded by the ICA to a local artist showing promise. The exhibit, featuring nine local artists, will be running through January 17, 2011. A panel of national judges will choose one of the works to receive the final prize—$25,000 to put towards their craft.
The individuals chosen are nominated by their peers, their teachers, and other artists in their community.
“It’s a prize about people who are being talked about. The best application is to be out there,” says the event’s curator Randy Hopkins. Siegel’s exhibit is a two-part creation consisting of a 20-minute film and a collection of photographic images. She says the inspiration to use film as her medium of choice originally developed in high school.
“I was always very taken with how people didn’t know how to talk about film. And yet it’s a mass art form. You know, you go to films with adults who say things like, ‘the cinematography was beautiful.’ But, a film is its cinematography, so it didn’t feel like quite enough of an understanding,” she says. “There seems to be a block in the ability to talk about film and its form, film as an art form, to speak about it formally.”
During her time off from Harvard, where she teaches advanced studio art courses dealing with video and photography, she has been filming and editing her work for the Foster Prize, as well as preparing her installation for another show opening in Berlin.
“Black Moon,” Siegel’s film currently on display at the ICA, is a quasi-science-fiction movie featuring shots of female soldiers roaming the post-apocalyptic Californian countryside. The piece was shot in Florida and California’s Inland Empire, areas with some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. She placed her revolutionaries—women fighting an unseen aggressor in a scene out of a science fiction movie—within this setting.
“What I found [in the houses] out there were these barriers and barricades, and I kept thinking that things looked like a battle, some sort of strange war had occurred, which seemed very interesting given that our country is involved in several wars abroad,” she says. “So I had the idea to come back and bring this troupe of female revolution quasi-soldiers, rogue bandit types, and put them in the landscape and have a sort of science fiction story.”
“Black Moon” is loosely based upon the 1974 Louie Malle film of the same name, which also features a gender-neutral battle field.
“I have an ongoing relationship to remaking things, treating other films as musical scores and text to perform, which is not how we classically think of the cinema,” she says. “It’s how we think about theater or music, that there exists a script, a play, a score to perform or interpret. With films, the only remakes that exist are for financial reasons, or to import or export something so that it’s palatable for consumerists in a new country.”
Instead of “remaking” films, Siegel uses them as jumping off points, a script of sorts to reinterpret. In one of her latest films, “Berlin Revisited,” she took shots of pre-war East Germany and recreated them exactly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Siegel saw the effect as a compression of past and present, watching the same moment played simultaneously decades apart. While the destruction of East Germany and the wasteland of Southern California may have a similar look, Siegel interprets them differently.
“In “Black Moon” I think you’re confronted with a different kind of ruin [than in “Berlin Revisited”],” she says. “It’s a very recent ruin, of the real estate bubble, and so it’s a ruin of a future that never came to be.”

“In some sense, we had a really nice fight,” says fourth-year Ph.D. music composer Edgar A. Barroso when describing his first experience working with his partner, a video maker, in Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) 157t: “Electro-acoustic Music and Video in Dialogue.” Occasional disagreements aside, the principal aim of this course is to foster productive collaboration and exploration during the artistic process.
As the brainchild of VES professor Alfred Guzzetti and Music professor Hans Tutschku, the instructors were inspired to develop this class after realizing the importance of developing a common language between visual and musical artists.
Tutschku described his thought process behind the course saying, “You see a lot of attempts where musicians and video makers try to work together, and most of the time there’s a problem of communication where they don’t really know what the other medium is able to do.
For Guzzetti, VES 157t is about pushing one’s limits. “The way the course proceeds is that each person learns something as much as they can about the other art, so the composers and video makers aren’t supposed to stay in their little boxes,” he says.
The course requirements consist primarily of four projects in which each visual artist will be paired with a fellow composer. Though the students are initially working in the medium they are most comfortable with, the artists will eventually trade roles with their partners.
By the end, everyone will have had to undertake both jobs in solo projects. These will then be showcased in December at Paine Music Hall using two video screens as well as a Hydra sound-system.
For the first assignment entitled “Water,” Abel Acuna ’11 and Jonathan Jain ’12 attempted to create a sequence with a man filling up a Super Soaker and running down the street.
“We showed this to Hans and Alfred, and they totally hated it,” Acuna says. “They said, ‘You constructed this scene here. This isn’t want we wanted.’ They insisted we construct something out of something very simple.”
Heeding their professors’ advice, he and Jain decided to return to the basics and create a piece around the idea of a faucet spraying down water.
Barroso says he tried to transcend the triteness of water and design something not-too- perfect and not-too-chaotic.
By playing with image-sound delay, he and his video maker partner, Elizabeth B. Wood, a second year resident tutor in Cabot and a fourth-year biophysics graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, managed to create a piece with ice cubes striking and melting against a metal bowl.
Barroso says having another pair of ears in the recording and editing studio forced him to reexamine and defend his artistic decisions. Because Wood was able to offer him opinions that weren’t necessarily musically-refined, Barroso says, “She really taught me how to listen in a different way.”
The course’s three other audiovisual projects focus on motion, the duality of sound and image, and finally, rhythm. For Tutschku, rhythm is the “overarching theme” of the second half of the semester.
Despite its usual association with music, he says rhythm plays a vital role in video composition.
Likewise, Guzzetti believes there are many similarities between video making and electro-acoustic composition.
“Both of them are arts that exist in time, both are primarily pre-recorded, they’re both processed these days using computer language, and the basis of both is the timeline,” he says.
Guzzetti and Tutschku recognize that the main challenge students face is finding the balance between the two art forms.
To achieve this equilibrium, Guzzetti explained that video makers have to break away from the ‘movie-soundtrack’ mentality, and that composers have to see beyond the music video.
Tutschku elaborated on the difficulty of stepping out of one’s artistic comfort zone: “The largest challenge for video makers is to forget about a story, so they don’t have a pre-written story and then try to narrate that.” He adds, “Perhaps their understanding of a video work can grow out of materials, energies, contrasts, and other forms of expression instead.”
Although Acuna’s forte lies more in the commercial aspect of video making, he hopes his experience in this class will broaden his artistic horizons.
“I am just really enjoying looking at how to tell a story differently than we usually think of doing it,” he says.

When Michael Cunningham recast Mrs. Dalloway in “The Hours,” he gave her a new surname and a twentieth century setting. He aligned Clarissa Vaughn’s story with vignettes of her predecessor’s creator and those of a 1950s housewife struggling with domesticity. Despite nearly a century between them, Cunningham bound together these women’s lives with an exquisite portrayal of their fits of despair, their doubts about love, and their deliberations on the redemptive power of suicide.
“By Nightfall,” Cunningham’s latest work, is another revival. Borrowing from Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” the novel reinterprets Gustav von Aschenbach’s plight—that of an older man, captivated by the youthful beauty he has relinquished to time, ultimately ruins himself with an obsessive attraction. Cunningham proves, once more, that he is inarguably good at adapting a prior text and its nuanced symbols to a modern context. But where the 1912 novella had a controlled poignancy, Cunningham’s plot can feel laborious and digressive. “By Nightfall” intends a penetrating examination of middle-aged life and its crumbling foundations, but it lacks focus and convulses with histrionics, rendering the book simply teenage angst for grown-ups.
Cunningham, who provided the introduction to Michael Henry Heim’s 2004 translation of “Death in Venice,” knows his Mann. Peter Harris, 44, is an art dealer, and his friend and fellow gallery owner’s recent diagnosis of breast cancer means he has the opportunity to add a promising red-headed artist to his modest repertoire (though no aristocratic ‘von’ to his name). Meanwhile, his wife’s brother Ethan moves in following a failed stint of “finding himself.” The Mistake, or Mizzy, as he is nicknamed, was born significantly after his elder sisters despite the efforts of a tubal ligation. Mizzy is a beautiful boy Peter likens to a Rodin sculpture and a carbon copy of Rebecca Harris in her young adulthood.  Like von Aschenbach, Peter attempts to compel his interest in Mizzy to the abstract and aesthetic, but he is too strongly drawn to what an affair, even platonic, would promise. When Mizzy abandons the Harrises as efficiently as he has every other ambition, Peter and Rebecca finally confront the masquerade of their bourgeois-elite lives.
But there’s also Peter’s brother, Matthew, who long ago succumbed to AIDS; past loves and dysfunctional in-laws; an alienated daughter (and several mentions of aliens). They all play a role, often emerging unbidden from Peter’s thoughts. The man is a mess, and perhaps Cunningham wants to prove that Peter could be any middle-aged passerby whose existence is not so tidy as to fit neatly within the covers of a book. More often than not though, the extra characters, complications, and abundant emotional baggage associated with the former are distracting.
As in “The Hours,” when he emulated Virginia Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness style, Cunningham creates depth by deftly handling prose. Sometimes within a paragraph, he transitions between omniscient narrator, Peter’s interior monologue, and a second-person interlocutor who usually serves as Peter’s subconscious. The effect of these transitions is to provide scope and to throw the reader from one point of view to another. The third-person narrative assembles the façade, but beneath that seemingly well-constructed exterior is Peter’s repressed introspection. Cunningham manipulates us well into believing how withdrawn he has become. The dialogues, similarly, have purpose—in present day, Peter trades words as if in perpetual transaction, but a flashback to a conversation between younger versions of the Harrises underscores how spontaneity, curiosity, and libido have diminished with time.
Thus Peter’s fascination with Mizzy is framed as an obsession with youth, as he admits to homoeroticism but not to homosexuality (because Cunningham’s characters never have sex—there is always motive; sex is always emotive). When Peter’s musings on youth are restrained, they are quite gripping: Mizzy was “looking so young and guilty and... tragic, tragic in a way that’s available only to the young, the young and self-immolating... it’s different entirely from the tragedies of age, even of middle age, when any hint of downfall is shaded by gravity, by wounds, by the simple, maddening failure to stay young. Youth is the only sexy tragedy. It’s James Dean jumping into his Porsche Spyder, it’s Marilyn heading off to bed.” But too often, as Peter kneels beside a sleeping Mizzy or compares the radiant glow of the brother to his wrinkling wife, Cunningham overdramatizes.
Art is at the forefront in this novel, at once protagonist, enemy, symbolic motif, and plot-driving force. Cunningham has no reservations about making Peter’s conflicts obvious: the man makes a living by selling art, his days consumed by his Ten Thousand Things to do, but he is desperate to find genius. “Peter realizes: in historical terms, most of these people... are the guildsmen, the carvers and casters... They feel pride in and detachment from their work. They have the customary array of louche habits, but they’re not nut jobs, they’re laborers, they have to be in this economy... Where are the visionaries, then? Have they all been lost to drugs and discouragement?”
Cunningham invents some unexpectedly imaginative post-modern work to give instances for Peter’s dilemma. There are the Sasha Krims—grotesque, amorphous, made of tar, resin, horsehair, and prone to dripping on the floor of the MoMA; the Rupert Groffs—commanding burnished-bronze urns with profanities, pornographic hieroglyphics, and manifestos carved into them so small they are only intelligible up close; the Bock Vincents—a series of canvasses shrouded in brown paper, waxed over with paraffin, and meant to expose the discrepancy between expectation and reality. When an accident occurs, and one of the wrappings of a Vincent is ripped, Peter finds, beneath the surface of what he had believed might be visionary, only clumsy, abstract student work—a subtle foreshadowing for what is to come with Mizzy.
“By Nightfall” means to be lovely and heartrending, but it may strive too desperately to be seen as having the genius Peter wanted to find in an artist. Like a Vincent in book form, it is bound up in Cunningham’s propulsive, poetic prose, but the work lacks the nuance that would elevate it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By 1963, when James Baldwin wrote “The Fire Next Time,” his apocalyptic, controversial essay on race in America, he had become one of the most important faces of 1960s Civil Rights movement. He appeared at rallies for justice and gave television interviews about the future of the country. His portrait graced the cover of Time Magazine, under the banner “Birmingham and Beyond: The Negro’s Push for Equality.” In his letters, the African-American author and activist debated whether to become “a Negro leader.”
Yet Baldwin considered himself primarily a writer, and it was through writing, he believed, that he could help America face its prejudice. “We cannot possibly become what we would like to be until we are willing to ask ourselves just why the lives we lead... are so ugly,” he once wrote in an essay on creative art. If there’s one main idea pulsing throughout the newly collected reviews and essays in “The Cross of Redemption: Uncollected Writings,” it’s that the country’s transformation can only happen with words.
This is not a conclusion Baldwin reaches easily. Some of the best essays in the collection find him at war with the English language. In “Why I Stopped Hating Shakespeare,” he describes his difficulty reading a white playwright whose words do not reflect his own experience: “I condemned him as a chauvinist... I condemned him as one of the authors and architects of my oppression.”
When he finally “heard” Shakespeare, as he describes in one essay, he resolved to make English words his own: “It might be made to bear the burden of my experience if I could find the stamina to challenge it, and me, to such a test.”
The results of this resolution are in Baldwin’s prose, which is rhythmic and forceful. He often characterized his writing as if it were infused with the blues. “I think I really helplessly model myself on jazz musicians and try to write the way they sound,” he said in a speech at a conference collected in the anthology.
This musical sensibility is at work in some of the more baroque writing in the collection. It lends Baldwin’s lofty ideas an equally majestic cadence. “Salvation,” he describes in piece about sex, “is as real, as mighty, and as impersonal as the rain and it is yet as private as the rain in one’s face.” The phrasing may seem archaic—words like “salvation” don’t come up very often in contemporary critical essays—but Baldwin’s pace makes it dance.
As he wrote his own novels and essays, Baldwin relentlessly pushed the boundaries of what he perceived to be stilted characters and hackneyed stereotypes in American literature. “In my mind, the effort to become a great novelist simply involves attempting to tell as much of the truth as one can bear, and then a little more,” he writes in an essay about the country’s fiction.
In his book reviews, he frequently admonishes writers for their inability to capture true human feelings. Even the Russian author Maxim Gorky, himself a political writer, does not pass unchallenged. Commenting on Gorky’s “Best Short Stories” Baldwin writes, “Gorky does not seem capable of the definitive insight, the shock of identification... Without [this], the concern with squalor remains merely squalid.” Baldwin’s confident tone is particularly surprising considering the circumstances: this was his first piece of literary criticism.
Baldwin’s success has not waned since his death in 1987; to many of his fans, aspects of this volume—a companion to the Library of America collection—may come as somewhat of a disappointment. For one thing, the book lacks useful footnotes. More context and commentary might have illuminated some of the secondary material that is provided, which does not stand well on its own. One short introductory piece discussing Baldwin’s role in Bertrand Russell’s International War Crimes Tribunal refers to Russell as a student of Wittgenstein—an odd mistake.
The range of Baldwin’s writing and the virtuoso aspect of his prose, however, carry over from the better-known volumes. There are many gems here: Baldwin’s impassioned essays on music, his talks on anti-Semitism, an article about a boxing match (“The feud between Patterson and Liston was as limp and tasteless as British roast lamb.”) And throughout, there is an endless exhortation to the importance of the writer’s job.
Was Baldwin too optimistic in his project? At times, he also doubted whether words would be enough. In his interviews with students, he couches his depictions of the Civil Rights movement in terms of mass uprising—“revolution,” “rebellion,” “Civil War.” “Mr. Baldwin, does that mean you’re advocating violence?” was a question he heard often, he explains in one speech. The answer is never given.
The issue seems especially relevant now. The kind of writing that Baldwin produced—slow and thoughtful—might no longer hold in the journalism world focused on short-term problems and solutions. Writing on equality has greatly shifted to blogging, which spends more time hashing out current events than putting forth grandiose ideas. These days, it can be difficult to find something as lasting as a Baldwin essay—as the kind of writing that gets under the skin and makes it itch.
Baldwin ultimately put his faith in writing, and by the end of his career had moved mostly to novels and poetry. In a piece on the sorry state of black characters in the theater, he wrote of his own task: “All I can do in the meantime, it seems to me, is attempt to prove, by hard precept and harder example, that people can be better than they are.”

An important subplot in Lan Samantha Chang’s “All Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Lost” involves a mysterious poem that is never properly finished. The poem, which shares its title with the novel, is an historical account of the discovery of the Mississippi River by the Québecois explorers Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette, written by Bernard Sauvet. Sauvet is a Joe Gould figure who spends his adult life working on the poem and scrambling for rent money. Although he rarely leaves his apartment, Bernard seems an explorer in his own right—the other writers that populate Chang’s story remain, for their entire careers, within the confines of creative writing programs, never venturing out of the academy.
Chang, who directs the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, does not seem to have any problem with these characters’ lack of experience with the outside world. Her new novel follows the life of poet Roman Morris and those of his classmates at an unnamed program in Michigan, not unlike that of Iowa. The novel’s early focus is on a poetry workshop, in which the main characters all participate. Chang then returns episodically to these characters as they advance through the creative writing establishment. That structure, which successfully evokes both the passage of time and the compression of memory, is one of Chang’s triumphs in a novel that otherwise feels incomplete.
“All Is Forgotten” is intended as a cerebral exploration of the limitations of memory and writing, at the cost of the work’s broader appeal. The story is told from the perspective of Roman, who decides after a few years in finance to pursue “a life of poetry,” which to him involves a Master of Fine Arts (MFA), then a series of fellowships and prizes, and then tenure. Early in “All Is Forgotten,” Morris is told by the brilliant and notoriously blunt professor Miranda Sturgis that he writes as if he has no soul. Chang doesn’t offer the opportunity to agree or disagree with this assessment, omitting every word of the poetry that means so much to Roman and his friends. And yet there is a sense that Sturgis is correct—Roman is coolly analytical and self-absorbed, and his rigid conviction that “all that matters is the work” leaves him with an empty personal life.
Chang renders Roman with plausibility and acuity, but in doing so disservices to her own work. The other characters in the novel appear as Roman perceives them—dully flitting around the periphery of his more important interior monologue. Additionally, Chang neatly skirts the problem of date by avoiding references to contemporary culture or places, but it gives her settings a curiously antiseptic feel. In a short story or a poem, one strong character and a set of obliquely-discussed themes would be satisfying, but this novel feels slight and even unfinished.
If there are moments when Chang’s focus on Roman is counterproductive, the novel’s episodic narrative helps to illustrate his uncomfortably static emotional life without becoming blatant or dull. And it is counterintuitive that her descriptions, which are sparse, simple, and rather repetitive, are so effective at creating a forlorn, elegiac mood that hangs over the story like a chilly Midwestern fog. It is hard to understand why she could not apply this virtuosity to her setting and characters; unlike Roman’s, her writing has soul, and indicates devotion to character and craft even when she misses the mark.
Chang’s decisions—to set “All Is Forgotten” at the Iowa-like school, to populate it with young writers replete with scarves and cigarettes and cliché anxieties, and to establish the two-year MFA program as extremely formative for each of its highly successful students—smack of self-congratulation. She preempts all possible criticism within her novel’s pages, as if by acknowledging that novelists might be perceived as “overly concerned with the well-worn paths of narrative and time” or that “there might be something territorial, or even boastful about...the idea that one could inhabit the subject matter,” she could make those criticisms less valid. This will be enough to put off many readers, but fortunately, the school, its students, and their discussions about writing are the background rather than the centerpiece of Chang’s concerns. She is more interested in constructing the interior world of a poet struggling to reconcile himself with his need to alienate himself from the world in order to write about it.
Although Chang develops Roman’s inner life spectacularly, it is ultimately not enough: “All Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Lost” needs an anchor for its self-conscious meditations. Bernard justifies his eccentric behavior by quoting da Vinci: “Art is never finished, only abandoned.” Although Chang’s own career has more in common with Roman’s than with Bernard’s, she would do well to take her character’s advice: “All Is Forgotten, Nothing Is Lost” is a work of art abandoned too soon.                                                                                                 —Staff writer Abigail B.

Printed zippers that do not work, pockets that cannot hold anything, collars that neither fold down nor sit upright, the expected utilitarian aspects of garments rendered useless­—Isaac Mizrahi’s Spring 2011 collection was filled with this tromp l’oeil detailing that seemed printed off the office copier minutes before its recent debut at New York Fashion Week. What seems at first glance gimmicky—restaging a tactic from Marcel Duchamp’s ready-mades, Andy Warhol’s silk-screening, or Minimalism’s seriality for the sake of pointless and playful citation—is Mizrahi contemplating and commenting on this recent explosion of copying in fashion and the industry’s inability to confront and contain it. Though this development allows the majority of consumers access to designs that otherwise would be unavailable due to the extravagant costs of high-end designers, it also exploits a gaffe in the fashion system and cheapens the originality of the designer’s products.
The borrowing from high to low fashion has always existed, but the speed, scale, and extent to which this occurs now is multiplied, disrupting the exclusivity and confidentiality that have characterized high fashion. The fashion show, which used to be limited to the eyes of buyers, editors, and a handful of privileged guests, now debuts on the Internet on the same day, if not live. Monthly publications, which once dominated the flow of information and images to the public, are now scrambling with their own websites to compete with the constantly updated musings and photographs of low-tech Tumblrs, chronic Tweeters, increasingly sophisticated blogs, and online-only magazines.
The fashion calendar, which places Spring collection debuts in September/October and Fall collection debuts in February/March, now undermines rather than facilitates the industry. During the time between runway and storefront, buyers decide which collections and which pieces will be stocked and thus which items the designers will put into larger production than the samples worn by models, while magazines start looking at what pieces to utilize for their editorial shoots. But with images of the designs now accessible months before they arrive in stores, other companies and individuals have templates to work with and time to tweak and translate costly and labor-intensive designs for mass production and lower prices. This is how H&M manages to carry a metallic military peak-shouldered shirt the same season as Balmain; how Topshop can offer a faux-shearling aviator jacket now when the original $5000 jacket is labeled Burberry Prorsum Fall 2010; or how similar bargain stores can keep pace with seasonal trends more effectively than ever before. With these stores, it is now possible to buy these creative products at a dramatically lowered and more appealing price point. Unfortunately it also allows the average consumer to make these purchases without knowing where the original design came from, undermining the creative role of the designer in the process.
Realizing the danger posed to the industry, high fashion is only now starting to react and reject these new developments. This Summer, Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, introduced the Innovative Design and Piracy Prevention Act. The bill provides a three-year protection to “new and original designs”—a difficult label to achieve. It also only restricts nearly identical copying, leaving the loophole of very similar borrowed designs intact. The legislation, which has yet to pass, is not enough to reclaim the control that high fashion once had over its products, but it would protect the industry from the most overt offenses.
Christopher Bailey, the chief creative director of Burberry, is taking matters into his own hands. Instead of waiting for buyers to put in orders, the brand live-streamed its show and simultaneously allowed viewers to pre-order coats and bags, though they will not ship for at least another month. The latest collection reflects the need for items that can be worn across all seasons and, more importantly, purchased now even when technically slated as a Spring and Summer collection. Thus Bailey is able to undercut the imitators’ strategies, protecting the novelty of his designs better than any legislation can. But ironically, the tactic is also self-limiting, as it shifts shopping from a tangible experience to a visual one, requires photographic pop and sheen rather than the subtlety and intricacy of inspection, and necessitates clothing independent from any specific season.
Despite how aesthetically different the Burberry and Mizarhi Spring collections may look, I think both are reckoning with the same pressure, but with divergent perspectives. Bailey accepts and adapts to the changing industry, forcing the brand and the designs to conform to a new business model. Mizrahi is more hesitant and ambivalent. His seemingly photocopied garments declare themselves as products of replication, but without any sense of an original. In abdicating the expected role of the designer to conjure up innovation that can be mimicked and expanded upon, Mizrahi models himself in the role of copycat and paradoxically achieves originality.

Within the first few minutes of “Mr. Marmalade”—which runs through October 2 in the Loeb Experimental Theater—it becomes clear that the set of cutely crooked windowpanes, toy baby dolls, and scattered teacups is far from indicative of the story to come. As the two main characters, four-year-old Lucy and her imaginary friend Mr. Marmalade, take the stage, their dialogue shifts abruptly from a playful bicker about imaginary coffee to accusations about infidelity in their sex lives.
The play continues this seesaw between childhood and adulthood, happiness and rage, humor and unease, and peace and chaos in a way that exudes anxiety, confusion, and unbridled emotion—just like Lucy. The cast adds to this frenzied script with its own set of extremes—emotions, music, lighting, tone—to create a perfectly bizarre, humorous, dark, and meaningful experience.
Mr. Marmalade (Daniel J. Giles ’13) is a portrait of the modern monster: his drug addiction and uncontrollable rage manifest themselves in the alternate neglect and physical abuse to which his corporeal companion is often the subject. His haphazard swings from love to anger to bitterness continue throughout the play and take their toll on Lucy, especially after she meets Larry, a suicidal five-year-old who actually treats her well. As Mr. Marmalade makes Lucy play house and doctor—which inevitably regress into sex games—she is torn between her desire to play with a friend and her imaginary friend’s desire for her to be much more than a child.
The first glimpse of Lucy (Vanessa B. Koo ’12) clad in an eclectic mash of stripes and flowers topped off with a frilly tutu and bright blue toe-socks humorously shows the tragic dichotomy between Lucy’s life as a child and the adult realities of that life. Larry (Philip M. Gillen II ’13) is similarly torn, and his undersized Disney sweatshirt and Superman underpants do much to evoke this.
While comical, these costumes (designed by Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11) cleverly support the central theme of the play: the loss of childhood and innocence to a modernity that forces children to be adults. This paradox is similarly marked in Snoweria Zhang ’12’s apt set design of baby dolls, chalk drawings, and colors reminiscent of childhood, when it’s marred by drugs, alcohol, and dildos as the play progresses.
This split makes its way into every aspect of the play, and is particularly well handled by light designer Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts editor. Lighting marks the different stages of Lucy’s emotions by alternating between harsh and warm light, and also predicts events: as Mr. Marmalade takes the stage further into the play, the lights flash red, a foreshadowing of the dark turn the action is about to take. These carefully-placed hints not only add complexity to an in-your-face theme, but also contribute to the play’s chaotic swing between extremes that gives the show such power.
The actors do a remarkable job balancing painful emotion with humor, and are able to ease an otherwise tense play without sacrificing its potent message. Koo slips into the mentality of a confused four-year-old and highlights Lucy’s pull between youth and adulthood as she slides between sing-songy child’s play and bossy command. Giles nails Mr. Marmalade’s childish seriousness and deftly explores a range of adult emotions, including boredom, coy flirtation, and pure rage. Robert A. Knoll ’13 portrays a humorous Bradley and never fails to break up the tense atmosphere with his charming presence—whether singing “Paper Moon” in a silky jazz voice or prancing up the stairs in his magenta button-down.
Director Julianne I. Ross ’11 controls this turbulent play by striking a balance between emotional range, pace, and power that enables the production to be meaningful and potent. While humor constantly breaks in, Ross maintains the sinister undertone and tension. Every aspect of “Mr. Marmalade” contributes to its chaos as it swings wildly from extreme to extreme; yet, each ties the play together.
In the end, the play’s uncensored and raw demand to be heard cannot be ignored. “This is how you play, Larry,” Lucy says as she introduces him to the game “doctor” on his first visit. And just like Larry, we listen.

In his directorial debut, Phillip Seymour Hoffman stars as a lonely, middle-aged limo driver whose life changes in small but profound ways upon falling in love. Though “Jack Goes Boating,” an adaptation of the 2007 stage play of the same name, was written by the author of the original play, the film fails to make a successful translation. The quality of Hoffman’s acting and infrequent scenes of dark humor provide rare moments of cinematic skill, but as a whole, the film’s poor pacing, forced dialogue, and lack of emotional identification with the characters ensure that “Jack Goes Boating” just can’t stay afloat.
The film’s plot focuses on the private joys and frustrations of two working-class New York City couples. Clyde (John Ortiz) and Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega, of “Rent” fame) are married, but suffering from deep-seated issues of romantic infidelity. As a favor to his sweet but lonely best friend Jack (Hoffman), Clyde arranges a blind date with one of his wife’s female co-workers, Connie (Amy Ryan).
Like the blind date it depicts in one of the earliest scenes, the film opens with an awkward, slow start. Sparse dialogue, uncomfortable pauses, and nervous laughter drag down the first half-hour, which only becomes more fluid, strangely, after a dramatic scene of unexpected violence. Indeed, the film’s greatest flaw is in its pacing; scenes of quiet understatement too often end abruptly or even disturbingly. In one such scene, Lucy is shown calmly leaving for work, chatting with her husband in an extended, slowly-developing dialogue, only to arrive at her office to find a completely brutalized and bloodied Connie sitting at her desk, trying to make an over-the-phone sale despite her horrific wounds.
In another such instance of almost-boredom rapidly shifting to violence, a dinner party scene depicts the two couples indulging in some hookah before their meal, and a leisurely, blurred montage traces their collective slip into drug-induced relaxation. But when the fire alarm goes off, the otherwise mellow Jack explodes into a violent rage, smashing glass and screaming with fury. Instead of being artful or moving, these dramatic, jarring shifts in tone simply feel unnecessary and disruptive.
His over-the-top outburst notwithstanding, Hoffman’s performance as Jack is easily the highlight of the film. Quiet but kind, Jack’s personal warmth is evident in his easygoing manner, willingness to please Connie, and his loyalty to Clyde. His upbeat nature is even evident in his choice of music, as he is rarely seen without his reggae-blasting headphones, carefully fitted over his pseudo-dreadlocks.
The film also benefits from a few moments of humor, though they are dark and infrequent. In one scene, Connie tells the inspiring, uplifting story of her elderly father’s resilient emergence from a two-month coma, and his avowal to live and care for her aging mother. After pausing a moment to smilingly acknowledge the well-wishes of her friends, she matter-of-factly announces, “But as he was leaving the hospital, he fell and hit his head and died anyway.” Moments like these provide a brief sense of levity in an otherwise unhappy film.
And unhappy it is; throughout the film, certain weighty topics are introduced, but then are consistently curtailed or left undeveloped. For instance, one theme that receives frequent attention throughout the film is Connie’s tendency to suffer unwanted sexual advances, be it her boss’s borderline-inappropriate hand placement, or the violent aggression of a sexual predator on the subway. In the very opening scene, she even claims that a hospital employee tried to hit on her while she was visiting her father. While allusions are made to some history of sexual abuse, this oft-mentioned element of the film fails to contribute to its overall development, as it doesn’t provide the arc of personal growth for Connie that it could.
From the start, the film establishes that each character has his or her own small, long-term goals. Through Connie’s offhand comments about wanting to go boating and attend a dinner party, Jack decides to learn new skills, like cooking and swimming. Connie, in turn, hopes to improve at her job as a saleswoman for grief-counseling courses by closing more deals. Even the happy-go-lucky, frequently-stoned Clyde takes night classes at a community college to finish his degree. Yet each character’s private mission fails to prove inspiring or even interesting to watch, for the actors fail to create truly engaging performances on an emotional level, and each thread remains unintegrated.
Above all, the film is modest in its scope. It doesn’t attempt to make any sweeping commentary about the difficulties of modern romance; instead, it simply presents a no-frills, character-driven drama whose tensions are intended to lie in the smallest of moments. Unfortunately, however, “Jack Goes Boating,” can’t capture these subtle nuances of feeling.  Although the actors supply a high degree of intensity at times, this frenzied and frequently disjointed display of passion fails to connect with the viewer.

The wise words of the Bard printed above the stage of the Boston University Theatre read: “To hold as ‘twere the mirror up to nature.” In keeping with such a motto, William Inge’s “Bus Stop”—currently playing at that theater—successfully holds a mirror up to the human natures of desire and love.
“Bus Stop,” which runs through October 17 in a production by the Huntington Theatre Company, sees an assortment of strangers get stranded at a diner during a fierce snowstorm in Kansas City. Over the course of one night, the group forms a bond through sharing stories and revealing their hidden secrets, ultimately leaving the diner with new outlooks on life. Nicholas Martin’s direction produces an array of comedic moments delivered by a tightly-knit ensemble who thoroughly understand their characters. “Bus Stop” delivers heartwarming relationships, dry wit and humor, and a fair amount of scandal and glamour in an energetic production.
The show is filled with fighting, laughter, heartache, and the search for love. At the diner owned by Grace Hoylard (Karen MacDonald), her young employee Elma Duckworth (Ronete Levenson) dreams about growing up and discovering the world outside Kansas City. But that world is brought directly to her doorstep—or more precisely to her bus stop—as a university professor, a nightclub dancer, and a pair of cowboys get stranded for the night.
Sheriff Will Masters (Adam LeFevre) acts as the peacekeeper between the boisterous cowboy Bo Decker (Noah Bean) and the illustrious nightclub entertainer Cherie (Nicole Rodenburg) who he intends to make his wife. In the midst of these confused young lovers is Bo’s old companion, Virgil Blessing (Stephen Lee Anderson), who serves as both a father figure and a friend to Bo. While Elma finds an intellectual companion in the slightly inappropriate—and rather intoxicated—Dr. Gerald Lyman (Henry Stram), Grace finds someone to fill the void left by her ever-absent husband in the form of bus driver Carl (Will LeBow).
Over three short acts, the ensemble cast quickly establishes the fears and hopes of their characters, as it becomes apparent that the stranded strangers have more in common than they might have first thought. As Cherie begins to understand the meaning of love and marriage, she confides her fears in Elma, who has equal reservations about being intimate with men.
Rodenburg’s relationship with Levenson hits the right level of intimacy as the two young women share with each other their views on love. When Rodenburg toys with Levenson by saying, “Maybe you have to find out for yourself it doesn’t exist,” the sincerity in Levenson’s voice as she responds, “I hope it does” allows for a moving moment between two very different young women.
Levenson’s relationship with Stram, her on-stage intellectual counterpart, is intentionally awkward at times and makes for a strong representation of male lust over naïve youth. Yet, Stram strikes the balance between letcher and loner; in the end, a pitiable character. In a particularly poignant moment, Stram delivers a scene from “Romeo and Juliet” where he falters at the discussion of love and then comically passes out. Here, Stram nails the emotion of a divorced man unable to settle in life.
Stram’s performance is rivaled only by that of Rodenburg, whose accent, demeanor, and gazes of amazement and adoration create a believably misguided young woman. Rodenburg’s competency in handling the realization that Bo’s declarations of love are sincere leads her to effectively portray the development of gradually accepting his romantic advances.
Bean equally shows a change in understanding what it means to be in love. Although he struggles to fully portray the boundless youth of a 21-year old, his moments of immaturity and misunderstanding are comedic nonetheless.
This action throughout the play is enhanced by a set which is innovative, creative, and makes use of the stage space to the greatest ability. James Noone’s scenic design incorporates an authentic diner interior, a snow-filled road, and an exterior snowstorm which gradually subsides as the show progresses. The space dividing the bar and the diner creates additional opportunity for interaction and comedic moments, especially when Cherie climbs onto the counter to deliver her nightclub performance.
Although the romantic climax of the play is not a surprise (even the characters acknowledge this fact, as MacDonald declares, “I knew this was gonna happen”), the production is still emotionally satisfying. What really resonates is the journey each individual character undergoes as the night unfolds. The cast successfully portrays these believable individuals who—despite the risk of being clichés—have a depth with which it becomes possible to sympathize. As the lights of the diner switch off for the night, it feels as if these very real characters live beyond the realm of the play.

Director Zack Snyder’s “Legends of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole” is a rarity among modern animated films, in that it is actually made solely for the entertainment of a younger audience. Unfortunately, however, everyone under the age of four who wants to see this film will likely be accompanied by their parents, and those parents are in for a decidedly unpleasant experience.
The basic premise of the film, which is an adaptation of a series of children’s novels, is not particularly original: a young owl must escape his dire situation, find the heroes who can save the day, and, in so doing, become a hero himself by the time the credits roll. While a more mature audience may enjoy the breathtaking animated world the owls inhabit, there is little else to recommend.
“Guardians” begins with the young owl, Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess), living a peaceful life in his hollow and dreaming about the legendary Guardians of Ga’Hoole, a mythical tree across the sea. While Soren’s parents and sister support his active imagination, his mean-spirited older brother, Kludd (Ryan Kwanten), finds his brother to be a nuisance and knocks him out of their tree and onto land, a dreaded place where no owls are supposed to go. Soren and Kludd quickly realize their situation is much more dire as a pair of strange owls kidnap them and deliver them to a sort of owl concentration camp run by the evil Pure Ones.
Oddly enough, it is during this kidnapping scene that “Guardians” introduces its first unsuccessful attempts at comic relief. For example, one of the younger owls pokes fun at the older owl’s attempts to make a scary face, but neither his jibes nor the older owl’s antics are particularly amusing. Furthermore, this sequence essentially serves as a reference to Nazi Germany, as the impure owls are forced to do slave labor in the camps. Only an adult will understand this allusion fully, and yet there is simply nothing for an adult to connect with, as both situations of humor and tension fall flat.
Another reason “Guardians” will fail to capture the imagination of more adult viewers is that the pacing is far too fast. Like many film adaptations before it, “Guardians” unsuccessfully attempts to capture the essence of three complete books in one relatively short movie. This truncation results in abrupt transitions and a dearth of scenes bearing any emotional weight. Also lacking for mature audiences is character development; Soren is a completely righteous hero who never doubts what the right thing to do is, while Kludd, whose eventual betrayal holds so much potential for character development, falls flat as well—from the film’s opening, one can predict his full trajectory, never fearing that he will remain on the side of the villains by the time the movie ends.
The animation, however, is stunning. One need only glimpse a frame of the film to deduce the extraordinary level of care that went into crafting both the characters and their world. Towards the end of the movie, for example, Soren flies into the eye of a storm, and the individual plumes of each of his feathers sway beautifully in slow motion as spirals of water dance across the screen. Snyder has certainly not discarded his penchant for visual splendor, even when making a bland children’s film.
Visuals alone do not suffice; a large budget can make any film interesting to look at, but both humor and pathos must be earned by a well-developed script. Though a child who has not yet learned to appreciate narrative complexity may be mildly entertained, “Guardians” is a thoroughly dull experience for all those who expect Pixar-level quality from an animated film.

I can’t think of another show with the extraordinary credentials of “Boardwalk Empire,” much less one that lives up to them. Helmed by director Martin Scorsese and “Sopranos” writer Terence Winter, the show has been rightly hailed as manna from heaven. But it’s not heaven, it’s HBO.
“Boardwalk Empire” stars Steve Buscemi—who himself guest-starred in the fifth season of “The Sopranos”—as Enoch “Nucky” Thompson, Atlantic City treasurer-cum-bootlegger and racketeer. I think he might be perfect in this role.
The show as a whole is less so; after all, a pilot is necessarily television with training wheels. And, in the case of “Boardwalk Empire,” it’s hard not to be a little heavy-handed when there’s a lot to carry. “Boardwalk” ambitiously takes on not only Nucky’s crew, but also out-of-town mobsters, prohibition agents, and uptight temperance matrons.
While “Boardwalk” never feels derivative, its influences are reassuringly apparent. In the first act alone, there is a freeze-frame that is textbook Scorsese, and an extended tracking shot of New Year’s Eve boardwalk revelry echoes the director’s famous three-minute descent into the Copacabana from “Goodfellas.” The scene in which Nucky watches a premature baby in a boardwalk incubator exhibit strikes me as a “Sopranos” dream sequence—specifically, those of “Funhouse,” the second season finale, which traveled with Tony’s subconscious to the wintry, post-apocalyptic Asbury Park boardwalk.
But Nucky is no Soprano. The pilot’s most Tony-esque figure is a young hood from Chicago—whose identity I won’t give up here, because the reveal is one of the great small delights of the pilot. In fact, the mob protagonist Thompson reminds me of most is Robert DeNiro’s Ace Rothstein, manager of Scorsese’s titular “Casino.”
Nucky is fascinating precisely because, like Ace, he isn’t a caricature of a mafioso. He is corrupt, yes, but far from evil. Ever the politician, Thompson alternates disarming frankness and glad-handing white lies. Passing through a wake, he informs the grieving widow that he spoke to her late husband “just last month”—puzzled, she comments to a friend that her husband had undergone a laryngectomy. But “Boardwalk Empire” is too coy to tether itself entirely to any one individual. The pilot’s other notable performances include Michael Pitt as Jimmy, Thompson’s conflicted henchman, and Kelly McDonald as a possible romantic interest for Nucky.
The boardwalk itself is effectively a character—part Brooklyn set, part beautifully rendered CGI. You can practically smell the creosote and salt water. The boardwalk, which visibly entrances Thompson, serves as liminal space between land and sea—just as the country is between World Wars and (quite literally) on the eve of Prohibition; just as Nucky falls somewhere between an old definition of “gangster” and a new one. Many of the boundaries in Thompson’s life are porous and uncertain—last night’s flapper staggers hungover into his office the next morning.
So, the premiere of “Boardwalk Empire” is exciting and encouraging, but a word of caution is necessary. Winter, Scorsese et al. will have to find a way to negotiate the expansiveness of their subject matter without ever verging into History Channel territory. But there is a risk that concerns me more. A troubling byproduct of the pilot’s instant critical success is that a television series based on “Goodfellas” may now be in development, with the alleged involvement of original screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi. “Goodfellas,” along with “The Sopranos,” is one of the cultural objects that fills for me the void that religious faith occupies for others. I do not wish to see it become a victim of our cultural obsession with adaptations, remakes, and reboots—which, truth be told, is interchangeable with an obsession with box office returns.
But “Boardwalk Empire” has no such pacing problem. At the episode’s close, Nucky approaches a fortune teller’s booth on the boardwalk. “What does the future hold for you?” the sign asks. As “Boardwalk” has already been picked up for a second season, we’ll be sure to find out.

Every savvy Internet-user knows this story. Boy “meets” girl. Boy stalks girl on Facebook. Girl looks cute, so boy calls girl. Girl sends boy music. Boy sends girl dirty texts. Ah, love in the digital age.
But “Catfish” will make one think twice about the now-commonplace ‘Facebook romance.’ Unlike “The Social Network,” the other Facebook-themed film coming out this season, “Catfish” is not a dramatized account. Instead it’s a (purported) documentary that superficially resembles a suspense film; even the filmmakers, Ariel Shulman and Henry Joost, participate in the story as it unfolds. “Catfish” is saturated with familiar digital imagery—the Facebook homepage, lists of wall posts, Gmail inboxes—lulling the viewers into a false sense of Internet security. But as the film progresses, that sense of safety is revealed to be dangerously illusory.
The story follows Nev Shulman, a twenty-something photographer living in New York City, through his fraught online relationship with an unnamed Michigan family. Nev shares an office with his brother Ariel, a filmmaker who happens to be in the right place at the right time, and starts filming the correspondence as it progresses.
It all starts when Nev gets a package from an 8-year old girl who has made a painting based on one of his photographs that was published in a magazine. Abby becomes his pen pal, and ultimately Nev begins to communicate with the whole family through email and Facebook, including Abby’s mother Angela and her older sister Megan. Megan turns out to be a model, photographer, and musician, and she and Nev start a steamy online long-distance relationship. They text, call, Gchat, and even send each other postcards in a fit of snail-mail nostalgia. Unfortunately, Nev decides to drive out to Michigan to meet his dream girl in person.
Obviously, nothing turns out quite as Nev thinks it will. But without spoiling the plot’s surprising conclusion, it’s safe to say that “Catfish” exposes some of the most basic lies many tell themselves when escaping from reality on the Internet. And while there is no ax-murdering involved, this is as horrifying a psychological thriller as any Hitchcock movie.
Nev Shulman carries almost the entire film, since most of the other “characters” are either out of frame or online until the last third of the movie. Affable and good-looking, Shulman has the perfect combination of confidence and self-consciousness about his online entanglements. In one particularly embarrassing scene, he reads his and Megan’s illicit text conversation aloud to his brother, which ultimately causes him to hide under his comforter and the audience to squirm in their seats. This scene, along with many others, highlights the uncomfortable divide between textual communication and the actual spoken word, and reminds the viewer how awkward solely technological relationships can become.
Despite the implicit critique of the Internet identity complex, “Catfish” also acknowledges the importance of the Internet as a canvas for re-invention, and the mixed joy and sadness one can find in escaping from everyday drudgery. The film’s twist is a poignant reminder that Facebook can be the setting for a second life, if real life ever becomes too disappointing to handle.
While some viewers doubt that “Catfish” is actually as ‘real’ as it claims to be, the narrative that emerges is so vivid that even if the scenario were scripted it would still resonate. And since the whole film is about the blurry boundaries between reality and fiction, the potentially dubious degree of authenticity ultimately doesn’t harm the film. Scripted or not, “Catfish” succeeds in pointing out the often-gaping divides between who we actually are and who we wish we were, and how the Internet can bridge those divides in dangerously seductive ways.

In the quietly terrifying dystopian Britain of “Never Let Me Go,” art might literally be the saving grace for a trio of young adults facing a deadly future. “That’s the whole thing about art,” explains Tommy (Andrew Garfield): “It says what’s inside of you; it reveals your soul.” If that’s the case, then it seems that director Mark Romanek’s soul is rather obtuse, and completely enamored with the conventions of Hollywood filmmaking. Fortunately for Romanek, several of Tommy’s beliefs about art are disproved by the end of the film, and although “Never Let Me Go” remains flawed, it also demonstrates a high level of technical skill that will serve the director well if he ever learns to trust in the intelligence of his audience.
The film, based on Kazuo Ishiguro’s acclaimed novel, sketches the relationships between Tommy, Ruth (Keira Knightley), and Kathy H. (Carey Mulligan), who spend their childhood at Hailsham, a boarding school for “special” children, and remain in touch later in life. Initially, it seems unclear why the actors, who deliver the realistic dialogue with subtlety and sensitivity, shuffle towards their fate with all the initiative of laboratory mice. However, it quickly becomes clear that character development is one of several areas in which Romanek’s translation of source material into film went awry. It is a natural and relatively common convention to represent internal states in a novel; this is not so on film, where Romanek lacks the creativity to convey his characters’ motivations. Most of the time he does not even try, and when he does, relying on voice-overs by Mulligan at particularly dramatic moments, the technique seems so heavy-handed and clichéd that it distracts from what is said.
“Never Let Me Go” seems written to be an independent film—its episodic story line, literary pedigree, and ambiguous love story all require a more inventive style than conventional storytelling can provide. Romanek seems entirely oblivious to this need, and working with cinematographer Adam Kimmel, has created a visual aesthetic that is part-wildlife documentary and part-unmemorable Oscar bait. Nearly every sequence is bookended with shots of raindrops and dewy grass; while some are very beautiful indeed, they serve no clear purpose in context. Similarly, Kimmel’s slightly seasick handheld camera does nothing but offer a reprieve from the otherwise numbingly conventional compositions, and lay bare the director’s uncertainty about what the film’s aesthetic should be. But perhaps the most glaring flaw in “Never Let Me Go” is its overbearing score. Romanek uses the string-heavy music as a crutch to such an extent that he undercuts the emotion that was already present in the acting and screenplay.
This is not to say that Romanek lacks skill, only that he does not know how to apply it correctly—an unsurprising fact given that he specializes in music documentaries and videos. Ishiguro’s novel is hard to ruin, and despite his pandering, Romanek’s execution is largely sound. He demonstrates a particular sensitivity to the use of light—something that is often ignored by directors working in color—and his palette, dominated by blue, gray, and off-white, is pretty if not appropriate to the story’s understated menace. And by avoiding the trap of dwelling too much on the logistics of the film’s alternate history, he shows at least some appreciation of Ishiguro’s emphasis on human relationships and psychology.
There is a scene in the middle of “Never Let Me Go” that is representative of the film’s ultimate weaknesses. Knightley and Mulligan run on a beach and commiserate about their origins. “We are modeled on trash,” Knightley screams, to the more restrained Mulligan’s discomfort. Everything about the sequence is competent, from the somber color scheme to the heartfelt performances. The scene should be wrenching, and yet it is not. In “Never Let Me Go,” the society assumes that the “special” residents of Hailsham have no souls. The audience knows that they do, but Romanek’s overbearing directing calls into question whether the same can be said of his film.

Maroon 5’s latest album, fittingly-titled “Hands All Over,” anticipates the eager hands of many fans after a three-year hiatus. Since their first major hit, “This Love,” Maroon 5 has mastered the art of writing catchy, smash-hit records—tunes that are easily remembered; that reel in the big bucks; that attain multi-platinum, Grammy award-winning status. Nonetheless, bogged down by predictability, their newest LP fails to live up to its name.
“Hands All Over” definitely presents Maroon 5 at its most polished state in eight years. The band succeeds in producing pop tunes that complement their signature funky sound. Yet (or perhaps consequently) many of the songs sound too formulaic and perfectionist. There are no surprises in the album; all the melodies and bridges are rather predictable. For instance, in “No Curtain Call,” the background instruments lack inspiration and drag on monotonously. Though the lead guitarist, James Valentine, is capable of playing fresh, intricate phrases, he fails to deliver on this track.
However, the first half of the album highlights Valentine’s signature power-pop guitar riffs that help propel Adam Levine’s vocals. This combination makes the opening song, “Misery,” at once memorable and danceable. Maroon 5 makes feeling miserable in an abusive relationship sound anything but. This song highlights the band’s larger, more explosive and focused sound. At its core, though, “Misery” echoes the band’s traditional sound on “If I Never See Your Face Again” and “This Love.”
The second track, “Give a Little More,” succeeds in doing just that. The syncopated guitar riffs, Levine’s powerful falsetto, and effortlessly executed harmonies are reminiscent of disco. “Don’t Know Nothing” and the title track both offer slower beats, yet the repetitive, groovy, rhythmic bass lines that move in contrast with the overlying melodies combine for an overall funky, body-moving sound.
“Just a Feeling, “Never Gonna Leave this Bed,” and “I Can’t Lie” show off Levine’s smooth vocals which float in and out of his high-pitched falsetto and his throatier voice. These songs embody a balladic feel, offering more synthesizer and keyboard and fewer bass-powered progressions.
Though he’s a great singer, Levine overwhelms the album with too many vocals. There are times when the instruments should receive more of the spotlight, but are covered up with singing instead. To make matters worse, when you get past the feel-good vibe of this album and dissect these songs, the lyrics are all rather forgettable. For instance, in “How,” Levine sings, “I’m asking for your help / I am going through hell / Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice.” This cry for help from a lover is painfully reminiscent of many other typical love songs. Though the band has grown, the theme of their music has not—the lyrics are still about girls: desire, break-ups, and learning to move on.
The deluxe edition of the album offers acoustic versions of “Never Gonna Leave This Bed” and “Misery.” These acoustic, stripped-down tracks offer more personality than do the original, power pop-propelled versions. The acoustic version of “Misery” actually conveys a feeling of misery, because of its honest, pleading sound. Adam Levine also succeeds in covering Alicia Keys’ hit, “If I Ain’t Got You,” by infusing his own bluesy vibe in-concert. These last three studio-free songs encapsulate Maroon 5 at its core.
Maroon 5 definitely demonstrates growth as a band in this album, shown by their attempt to branch out into new genres—”Out of Goodbyes” is a collaboration with the country band Lady Antebellum. In general, the songs are cut cleaner, and Adam Levine’s vocals sound stronger. Unfortunately, the band’s originality loses steam and fails to carry them out of their comfort zone.

Shit Robot is dance music, and as such, hearing it for the first time at a discothèque—where the ceaseless electronic pulse would (presumably) sync with the flashing lights, and the (almost disjoint) vocals would add a sort of metacognition to the scene—is very different from listening to it on a pair of earbuds. The man behind the music, Michael Lambkin, is an Irish DJ who got started mixing beats in Dublin before bringing European electronic music to New York. He’s played in clubs for most of his career, and it’s clear from the variety in his bass lines that he has a good understanding of the dynamics of a dance floor. However, processing music when gyrating to it in a dark room is incomparable to simply listening, and Shit Robot’s new album, “From the Cradle to the Rave,” just doesn’t hold up quite as well to close attention and a well-lit room.
The aesthetic of Shit Robot, like that of much from its genre, is mostly one of combining beats—while it incorporates melodic elements, they’re often lost in the blips of the percussion. As such, much of its musical interest lies in the texture of its instrumentation. And while Shit Robot is adept at blending a beat, the scope of his sound isn’t quite broad enough to be consistently interesting. It’s a little too clean; there are a lot of silvery blips, some bouncing semi-musical percussion; but few elements of texture to add a grain to the medley. Exceptions are in the songs “I Found Love,” which incorporates a sort of electronic screech—like an engine accelerating or a record skipping and being swiveled back and forth on a turntable—and the less-melodic “Grim Receiver,” which opens with a percussive ricochet that lasts a good minute or so before fading to the bass line. “Triumph” even has the occasional ring of a guitar. Overall, the release has some interesting moments—the beat is usually varied, and though the music incorporates very few melodic elements, there’s some good bleedle-ing in “Triumph” and “Tuff Enuff”.
The voice clips added to the music may be the album’s most interesting element. While they often blend into the background, sometimes even acquiring the echoing thrum of the beat, their timbre adds a new dimension to the electronic grind. Lambkin used a variety of vocalists in the release—female and male, singing and speaking, often repeating the same lyrics over and over again—like some odd meditation on the synthesized tumult. Many of the vocalists are reminiscent of some older rock artists. The man singing in “Grim Receiver,” for instance, sounds not unlike the chorus of the Alan Parsons Project as he chants “Waiting for the grim placebo / Get yourself a new prevention;” the almost-psychedelic repetition in “Losing My Patience” is reminiscent of The Flaming Lips. All of the vocalists have a very distinct timbre, a sound that’s surprising, because it’s usually accompanied by drums and a guitar instead of the sound of synthesizers. The vocals are less melodic than one would expect from an electronic mix, but they add valuable texture to the rest of the sound, as well as some conceptual interest in their human counterpoint to a space-age jam.
Appropriately, most of the lyrics in the release are hazily centered on human life as it relates to machines. “Answering Machine” is particularly thoughtful; it’s an answering machine that talks back—“It’s not easy to play back, and listen again...”—with a sort of sultry plea, “I need more than your voice.” The song “Simple Things (Work It Out)” empahsizes the emotional subtext of the work: “Life’s so simple now / You’ve got computers to do everything / We don’t have to do anything! / Just open our eyes! / But man, even that’s hard sometimes!” Both concepts, as with much of the album, have a sense of vague foreboding about them—but, as with the other songs, they’re not well-articulated, and are more reflections than a cogent message.
Juxtaposed with the onslaught of the synthetics, the musing about machines is oddly self-conscious; perhaps the fingerprint of an artist who has spent more than twenty years playing this sort of music. Shit Robot is the sort of music that will either add an element of sophistication to the entire dance-floor setup, or make you eerily wonder what you’re doing there in the first place. Though I wouldn’t know, it’s probably a really great album for dancing. It’s probably an even better album to get drunk to beforehand. Don’t put it on iTunes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Confessions,” the second album released by Liza Minnelli since her decade-long bout with health issues, is the product of two jazz veterans: the legendary actress and jazz singer, and Grammy-winning composer and pianist Billy Stritch. Unfortunately, Minelli’s selection of repertoire—though all undoubtedly classic standards—are somewhat unflattering to the collaborators’ skills; the collection of fourteen songs, all describing love, are frustratingly monotonous in succession.
After sixty years in the entertainment industry, Minnelli still delivers her sultry contralto with spirit and skill, although—understandably so—it lacks the energy found in her Academy Award-winning performance in the 1972 film “Cabaret.” Nonetheless, in “This Heart of Mine,” her rich voice dances lithely around vocal melodies with precision when she sings, “Somehow this crazy man / Has taken all the wonderful design / As long as life endures, it’s yours / This heart of mine.” Although the vocal titan overuses vibrato—in “I Hadn’t Anyone Till You” she employs vibrato for almost every suspended note in the song—she proves her artistry through her ability to project emotions in her tones. In “Confessions,” she plays the master of the cabaret, and manipulates melodies with strategically-placed rubatos, accents and lilts to bring life to otherwise dull lyrics. She sways expertly from sweet and adoring to seductive and adventurous in “Close Your Eyes:” “Some dreaming for dancing / While we’re here romancing / It’s love’s holiday / And love will be our god / Close your eyes.“
Stritch’s skill on the piano is comparable to Minnelli’s vocal skill as he performs with an intriguing range of emotional expression. His piano solo in “Close Your Eyes” captures the suave essence of jazz; however, some instrumental variety would have given more depth to the songs. The album’s percussion seems to have been disregarded during production, as very little variation from a standard snare is employed. It would have added much-needed relief from the prevailing acoustic piano-vocal dynamic. As they are, it is difficult to distinguish between the songs. Tracks such as “You Fascinate Me So” conjure images of riding in an elevator of a tacky hotel due to commonplace and flat instrumentation.
While the vocal and instrumental skills are definite strengths of Minnelli’s album, the track list leaves something to be desired. Minnelli has uncovered some timeless classics, each written by talented songwriters, but she croons about love for the entire forty-five minutes—perhaps the 64 year-old legend has encountered another infatuation? “Confessions” invokes nausea likely due to a need to expel the overdose of melodramatic love-sickness, a sensation similar to one after gorging on a gallon of sickly-sweet ice cream. A selection or two that deals less extensively about love would have balanced out the album, and may have shifted the focus to Minelli’s and Stritch’s skills from the over-explored theme.
Despite Minnelli’s and Stritch’s mastery in voice and piano, “Confessions” suffers from its lovesick melancholy. With an exception for avid fans of 1950’s romance films, this album is best prescribed in moderation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Margot & the Nuclear So and So’s have always had the sex and the drugs, but they don’t always pull off the rock n’ roll. With their third studio album, the former tweesters amp up the electric guitars and develop a bit of swagger. That attitude, however, fizzles halfway into an incoherent album. Margot & the Nuclear So and So’s would seem to be a band unwilling to compromise—with their complex instrumentation and perefctionist streak—but “Buzzard” sounds like an unsatisfying middle ground between the Margot of old and their new approach.
The change in Margot’s sound is reflected in a line-up that now includes keyboards as well as additional guitars and percussion. Eric Kang’s violin, which graced the melodies of the two earlier albums, is nowhere to be heard on “Buzzard,” though he still plays guitar and lap steel.
The album’s opening track, “Birds,” is a strong introduction to the new direction in which Margot is headed. It begins innocuously enough, with a melody by the electric guitar accompanied by crisp percussion. However, when Richard Edwards’ voice reaches higher and higher into falsetto, it’s a clue that Margot is up to something. Indeed the electric guitar suddenly rips as Edwards repeats over and over, “Let’s have a party.” That refrain turns into “Let’s have baby,” and then, “Let’s make it evil.” The hints of the sinister and supernatural that pervade Margot’s earlier lyrics are found here as well.
“Let’s Paint Our Teeth Green” continues with more perverse suggestions. Edwards’ usually-languid, breathy voice yells over the blaring guitar. “Let’s move to Utah / Let’s make some sick love,” he yelps in successions, “Shoot our rifle / Let’s thump a Bible.” These things all sound tough, even if they don’t make much sense. It seems that the So and So’s want the rock star status but don’t really know how to go about it. After all, this is a band that once sang about paper kittens and bookworms.
This kind of inconsistency is also found in “Your Lower Back,” a dark song about sex and violence. The track begins with a sample from what sounds like an old-fashioned PSA warning about the dangers of sex. “[Sex] can even take us to the brink of madness,” cautions an overdramatic voice. This all seems funny and points to a cavalier and ironic attitude towards sex until one listens through to the song’s end. A girl—a very young-sounding girl—is asked what she did for her 18th birthday; “I went to a strip club. And got a job,” she replies.
But the album’s tone is hardly coherent, and there are songs on “Buzzard” that are unequivocal. “Claws Off” is unapologetically brash: “If you want to go, get lost / If you want to stay, shut up.” Some songs from the latter half of the album are also more sincere, revealing the muted agony of the old Margot. As its twee-sounding title suggests, the sixth track “Tiny Vampire Robot” signals a return to habits of old. This is a song with sorrows and tambourines. The emotional sincerity of these latter tracks—all stories of sadness out of which “Lunatic, Lunatic, Lunatic” is the standout—is at odds with the aggressiveness of the first half of the album.
“Buzzard” concludes with a stripped-down solo, “I Do.” The sound is so sparse that not even a strummed chord accompanies Edwards’ whispering and echoing voice as he fingers individual strings on acoustic guitar. The scuffling at the beginning and end of the track create an air of real intimacy that is lacking in the clamorous sounds earlier in the album. All pretenses are stripped. “I never know if you’re serious / Or if you’re putting me on,” he sings, “I guess it really doesn’t matter.” It’s hard to tell if Margot & the Nuclear So and So’s punk rock attitude is serious, but it hardly seems to matter either, since they don’t succeed when they try.
Bands can and should mature, of course, but Margot has hit growing pains rather than transcendence. “Buzzard” evinces confusion, caught between old habits and new desires.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Who are you gonna send it to?”
“Just a couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to?”
Thus begins a scene from the upcoming film “The Social Network,” which tells the story of the founding of Facebook, the now-ubiquitous social networking service, at Harvard in 2004. The scene in question involves a young Mark E. Zuckerberg, formerly of the class of 2006, and his friend Eduardo L. Saverin ’05. The two have just created Facemash.com—a hot-or-not rating website that offered Harvard students the opportunity to rank their peers by attractiveness—and sent out a link to some friends. After a rapid-fire montage of students gleefully ranking their friends and roommates, the Harvard network crashes from the amount of traffic it has generated.
“Unless this is a coincidence, I think this is us,” says Saverin.
“It’s not a coincidence,” Zuckerberg replies bluntly.
Following the short-lived Facemash, Zuckerberg’s next creation was a site all too familiar to us now—Facebook.com. Soon after launching the site from Kirkland House in February 2004, Zuckerberg took a leave of absence—from which he would never return—in order to work on the site. Months later, he was engaged in a federal copyright lawsuit. Cameron S.H. Winklevoss ’04, Tyler O.H. Winklevoss ’04, and Divya K. Narendra ’04 had founded a site called Harvard Connection (later to become ConnectU), and claimed that Zuckerberg had stolen the idea from them. Later, he was also sued by co-founder Saverin, who felt unfairly shut out of the company.
Unsurprisingly, Zuckerberg’s story turns out to be rich dramatic material. In a digital culture with a ravenous appetite for stories, this drama has already been taken, adapted, interpreted and rewritten at an alarming rate. Just as quickly as Facebook took off—it has garnered 500 million users in less than seven years of existence—so has its saga rapidly been subsumed into public discourse, inspiring several books and now a film. Last year, author Benjamin A. Mezrich ’91—a former Crimson cartoonist—published his own account of the events in a book entitled “The Accidental Billionaires.” Weeks after Mezrich had begun this project, his book proposal caught the eye of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, creator of “The West Wing”. Sorkin, along with filmmaker David L. Fincher (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac”), has just completed  work on “The Social Network,” a film that will share Facebook’s story with a national audience on October 1.
The upcoming premiere of “The Social Network” raises vital questions of the line between fiction and non-fiction. The book and the movie reveal a vast multiplicity of perspectives on the controversies surrounding the creation of Facebook. Mezrich and Sorkin insist that their works are non-fiction, despite Zuckerberg’s persistent refusal to provide his own first-hand account of the events. Likewise, despite Sorkin’s meticulous attention to detail, a Harvard audience might recognize that the film’s creators have taken certain liberties in its portrayal of campus life. Thus while Zuckerberg has been partial to the creation of a culture that usurps and corrupts stories beyond recognition, he himself is subject to the same kind of transformative forces.
“NOT ONE TRUE STORY”
“I consider the book entirely non-fiction,” Mezrich says. “The Accidental Billionaires” is a self-proclaimed “dramatic, narrative account based on dozens of interviews, hundreds of sources, and thousands of pages of documents.” The author accrued as many first-hand accounts as possible and undertook field research in and around Harvard campus. While his research was exhaustive, Mezrich’s method of writing non-fiction is decidedly non-traditional. He has attempted to reconstruct the Facebook story as a thrilling chronicle of true events embellished with literary elements like composed dialogue and figurative language.
Mezrich openly acknowledges that his mission is not wholly straightforward: he found himself challenged to construct a coherent story from conflicting perspectives. “We’re talking about something that happened a number of years ago. We’re talking about people who have vastly different memories of what happened during [a given] scene,” Mezrich says. “There are multiple ways to write that scene… For me, I’m describing the scene as I believe it looked based on the research.”
Though written in an omniscent third-person voice, much of the book specifically reflects the perspective of Saverin, Mezrich’s primary interview subject. “Eduardo I found a very compelling character,” he says. The author identified with the malcontent; “he’s a bit of a beaten-down puppy,” Mezrich says. Saverin’s openness gave him a privileged position in “The Accidental Billionaires;” “He’s kind of the main character of the book,” Mezrich says. Conversely, Zuckerberg’s reticence limited his own voice in the narrative. “I really tried not to write in Mark’s voice as much because it wouldn’t be fair to him,” the author says.
However, the absence of Zuckerberg’s perspective leads to a character that feels almost inhuman in comparison to the others. One of the final chapters of the book declares that, “Now, we can surmise, Facebook was the only true love of Mark’s world—the computer, that glowing screen in front of his face… Mark wouldn’t let anything, or anyone stand in the way of Facebook.”
Mezrich’s writing has been met with heavy criticism in the past. “I get attacked a lot by… old-world journalists,” he says. Literary critic Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote in her review of the book, “‘The Accidental Billionaires’ is so obviously dramatized, so clearly unreliable that there’s no mistaking it for a serious document.”
Mezrich unapologetically admits that he writes with cinematic flair. “I get really, really bored by non-fiction,” he says. “I want to live vicariously through my stories. For me, I want to entertain and be entertained myself. I think it’s a very good way to tell a story.” Ultimately, though, he stands by his work, pointing out that there is a substantial amount of gray area surrounding the Facebook saga. “There’s really not one true story,” he says.
DOWN TO THE LAST DROP
Mezrich’s dramatic writing style may be one of the reasons his 14-page book proposal captured Sorkin’s attention. Before Mezrich even began serious work on the book, his publisher circulated the proposal around Hollywood, where it quickly caught Sorkin’s eye. “When I was on page three, I said ‘yes’,” Sorkin says. “It’s the fastest I’ve ever said ‘yes’ to anything.”
The following months saw the two writers working concurrently on the their respective projects, composing two similar but essentially distinct stories. “Ben and I began at the same time. We were working separately but along parallel paths of research and then writing,” says Sorkin.
Sorkin insists on the veracity of his work: “Attention to truth and attention to detail were incredibly important to us,” he says. “When the truth was absolute and the truth was known, we gave you the truth.” In the scene where Zuckerberg creates Facemash, Sorkin adds, Zuckerberg is drinking Beck’s beer—the brand confirmed as the actual brand of beer he drank that night. Sorkin stresses how important their inquiries were, noting the exhaustive amount of research it takes to recreate such minutiae.  “The fact that we know what kind of beer he was drinking on a Tuesday night in October seven years ago when there were only three other people in the room should tell you something about how close our... research sources were to the subject in the event,” says Sorkin.
Sorkin is also careful to point out that disputed claims do not detract from the movie’s status of as a work of non-fiction. “It’s absolutely non-fiction,” he says. “There were two lawsuits filed against Facebook at roughly the same time… What emerged were three very different versions of the story. Instead of picking one and deciding that’s the truth, I liked that there were three different versions of the truth. It is non-fiction about facts that are in dispute… The movie doesn’t take a position on what the truth is.”
While the Sorkin’s script largely follows the trajectory of Mezrich’s book, Sorkin seems to have taken a much stronger interest in Zuckerberg. The product is a much more sympathetic approach to Zuckerberg’s character. “I can’t write characters that are built out of one-dimensional evil,” he says. “I have to like the character and be able to empathize and identify with the character.”
To this end, Sorkin’s take on Zuckerberg is not that of a man singularly obsessed with Facebook, but that of a deeply flawed antihero who acts out of insecurity rather than greed. Sorkin praises actor Jesse A. Eisenberg for his portrayal of Zuckerberg. “[He] never judges the character, never comments on the character, and never asks the audience to like him,” Sorkin says. “So that’s an incredibly courageous performance.”
CHARACTER SHOES
“I really tried to kind of understand who the real person was to help me prepare for the character.” Eisenberg’s words read as an understatement when one considers the pains he went through to emulate Zuckerberg effectively on camera. According to Eisenberg, his preparation for the role involved extensive research of Zuckerberg’s mannerisms and speech through pictures, videos, audio, and interviews he found. Eisenberg also took fencing lessons because Zuckerberg had been a fencer in high school—“I wanted to emulate that posture,” Eisenberg says. He even obtained Zuckerberg’s application to Harvard.
“Aaron Sorkin’s characterization of Mark was thorough and rich and nuanced in every way you want a character to be,” Eisenberg says. He adds that he felt a sense of sympathy toward the character of Zuckerberg. “I can only view him sympathetically because that’s what I was hired to do,” said Eisenberg, “I spent six months, 14 hours a day in his shoes.”
Armand D. Hammer, who played the Winklevoss twins in the film, expressed similar sentiments about Sorkin’s characterizations. “There’s not really a villain in this film. There are occasional moments when each character becomes an anti-hero… Each character has that sort of relatable sense of being a real person in a real situation.”
Thus the cast of the film engaged in a great deal of deeply personal work to portray their real characters authentically. However, both Hammer and Eisenberg seemed hesitant to judge how truthful or how dramatized the overall product was. They cite Sorkin’s script as their primary point of reference while building performances, and seem reluctant to comment on how dramatized or factual the events of the movie actually are. When asked about such issues, Eisenberg replied matter-of-factly, “I’m happy to not have to account for that.”
VERITAS ET VANITAS
While certain aspects of the film have raised questions of factuality—be it the characters, plot, or overall tone—there is no question that “The Social Network” recreates the environment of Harvard in a stunningly accurate and excruciatingly detailed manner. The film is peppered with minute, but meticulously-crafted details that may only be appreciated by a Harvard audience.
The script is replete with Harvardisms—at one point, Mark Zuckerberg abruptly corrects his girlfriend when she mistakenly refers to the Phoenix S.K. Club as a ‘finals club’ instead of a ‘final club.’ The production design also does a remarkable job of recreating Harvard with excruciating accuracy—from editing the tower of Memorial Church into scenes shot at Johns Hopkins University, right down to the regulation “DO NOT USE FIREPLACE” sticker on Zuckerberg’s mantle, “The Social Network” spares nothing in its pursuit of recreating Harvard with total precision.
While most of these details had to be entirely re-created in studios, select scenes were in fact shot in Harvard Square. The film includes an establishing shot panning over the Pit, as well as several exterior shots of the Spee Club, a stand-in for the Phoenix Club in the film. According to Mark S. Hruby ’78, a Spee graduate member who helped arrange the shoot, the primary reason the production sought to film there was because its corner location allowed for more dynamic shots, and because the production staff felt it would best establish what a final club was.
Isabel Q. Carey ’12, hired as an extra for the shots in Harvard Square, characterized her filming experience as an exhausting one. Carey—who learned of the casting opportunity through another Harvard undergraduate—was one of roughly 10 Harvard students hired to be extras in the film. As many people involved with the film emphasized, David Fincher is a perfectionist on the set, and is known for filming shots a remarkable number of times—according to Eisenberg, the opening scene of the movie was shot ninety-nine times, and Carey says she had a fourteen-hour day just doing extra work in a few shots. She does not feel that her presence as an actual Harvard student added anything to the film, characterizing her role in the shots as relatively mundane. “The work of an extra in this particular film was to walk from one location to the other,” she says.
Eisenberg, however, spoke highly of Fincher’s rigor during the filming process, and greatly appreciated the experience of shooting in Harvard Square. “It absolutely added something to the film,” he said, “I was disappointed that we weren’t able to film more at Harvard.” Eisenberg particularly found his experience of the atmosphere and culture of Harvard to be informative as an actor. However, such authenticity in recreating the environment of Harvard does not necessarily ensure that Harvard was depicted with complete verisimilitude in the final product.
INSIDE OUT
Given its carefully crafted portrayal of campus culture, Harvard students may view “The Social Network” with more scrutiny than the general public. Students had their first chance to see the film at an advance screening on September 22 at the Harvard Film Archive. Sorkin, Eisenberg, and Hammer were all in attendance and spoke briefly about the film at the event.
Benjamin J. Nelson ’11, a self-described “film buff,” was highly complimentary of the film on the whole. “The screenplay is well crafted, approachable, funny,” he says. “I thoroughly enjoyed it.” In spite of all the Harvard-specific information presented in the film, Nelson thought that a public audience would be able to fully appreciate the film. However, he expressed doubts that the average moviegoer would be able to distinguish fact and dramatization.
“I think they’ll be able to give themselves over to the conceit that’s presented in the movie a little more than we are,” Nelson says. He specifically referenced one scene in the film depicting a party at the Phoenix, where a bus full of women arrive at the club’s front door. They join an extravagant party replete with partial nudity and designer drugs. “I think if I had no idea, I would totally buy that the Phoenix does bring in buses of extremely attractive girls,” Nelson says. “I’d believe that if I weren’t a Harvard student.”
Nevertheless, Nelson thought the movie generally captured the feeling and atmosphere of Harvard accurately. “It got a lot of the basics right… Some things are taken a little bit too extreme, but not in a way that was blatantly unrealistic.” He also appreciated the authenticity of seeing familiar Harvard Square locales in the film: “Those places wound up having a bit more of a realistic feeling.”
Nelson’s concerns about the film lead back to an interesting set of questions about the boundary between fiction and non-fiction. The story of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, and its origins is one that is still evolving every day. It’s a story that has reached remarkable heights of cultural prominence in a remarkably short amount of time. Multiple versions of this story have already been told at this point. “The Social Network” will be yet another. For Sorkin, it isn’t necessarily definitive: “We want those kinds of arguments—what’s true, what’s not, who’s good, who’s bad… We want those arguments to happen in the parking lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Scott Brown (R-Mass.) recently criticized Harvard for having its values “upside down” by supporting the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act of 2007 while banning an on-campus Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. In his judgment, it is inconsistent to deny students the opportunity to serve their country and yet provide what he considers amnesty to students living here illegally. However, in our estimation, Harvard’s current stances on the DREAM Act and ROTC are perfectly defensible. This aside, the two issues are distinct; our rejection of ROTC stems from our opposition to the discriminatory practices of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, while our support of the DREAM Act reflects our commitment to citizenship and educational equality and opportunity.
First, Sen. Brown’s analysis was flawed by asserting ideological consistency as the sole virtue by which decisions are judged. Cases like these must be evaluated on their own merits, and this particular debate is far too complex for such broad-sweeping conjectures about what constitutes right and wrong. The DREAM Act and the ROTC ban must be judged individually not against the other.
That said, Sen. Brown mischaracterized Harvard and President Drew G. Faust’s dedication to public service. Suggesting that the ban on ROTC represents a slight to civic advocacy discounts the wealth of public service opportunities on campus. From Phillip Brooks House Association programs that engage with members of our community to concentrations that facilitate students’ entry into careers in public service, Harvard has shown a remarkable devotion to giving back. The school also provides fellowships, such as the Weissman International Internship Program grants, that encourage students to conduct meaningful and important work abroad. Considering the popularity of these opportunities that allow students to make a difference in the world, it is a gross misstatement to disparage Harvard’s commitment to service.
President Faust also deserves commendation for taking such a strong, definitive stance on the DREAM Act and ROTC. Harvard has an obligation to act morally, and the President’s principled positions are both bold and admirable. Considering the unequal treatment in ROTC toward certain students, we applaud President Faust for looking out for the entirety of the student body. Until our commitment to equality and fairness is echoed by federal policy, we hope that Harvard maintains its unswerving attitude toward these issues.
As Sen. Brown demonstrated, the debate on the DREAM Act and ROTC can easily become muddled. But we must stay true to our beliefs. We feel it necessary to echo our previously stated position regarding this matter: While we support the DREAM Act, we do not believe that military service should be mandatory for the students affected by the legislation. With that in mind, Sen. Brown should exercise greater prudence before he chooses to conflate these two policies. Harvard’s commitment to public service is resolute, and clearheaded analysis reveals that its stance on these issues is undeniably justifiable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since its meteoric ascent to the peak of the digital world, Facebook has arguably been the technology story of the decade. But with its remarkable success has come increased scrutiny, curiosity, and even criticism. This has been recently exemplified in the much-hyped movie “The Social Network,” a film about the founding of Facebook. While the movie has received positive reviews and looks to be a blockbuster hit in the making, viewers would do well to remember that “The Social Network” is clearly a dramatization and should be treated as such. Filmgoers should understand that the primary value of watching the movie is entertainment, not truth.
The film gives an account of the formation of the largest social networking website in the world. Loosely based on the book The Accidental Billionaires, this Aaron B. Sorkin adaptation paints a sensational picture of intrigue and ambition prevalent at Harvard, timeless strategies for creating an instant hit. Rather than focusing on the real societal changes caused by Facebook, at the heart of it all is the 26-year-old Mark E. Zuckerberg, cofounder, billionaire, and former Harvard student.
While the movie has not been released yet, it seems clear from the various trailers, clips, and reviews that actor Jesse A. Eisenberg’s portrayal paints an uncomplimentary picture of Zuckerberg, involving awkwardness, ruthlessness, and potentially even betrayal; the plot itself suggests that Zuckerberg may have committed theft. Neither Facebook nor Zuckerberg offered input—at least in part because Facebook refused to be involved unless the company was referred to by a different name and the setting was not Harvard, according to the film’s producer. Thus, regardless of who was at fault, one crucial side of the narrative is inherently missing from the final product, preventing viewers from seeing the whole story. On top of that, a major source in the book, and consequently the movie, was Eduardo Saverin, who at the time was suing Facebook. Thus, we find it difficult to believe that the film truly captures an unbiased account of Facebook or Zuckerberg’s personality. It seems more likely that the film reduces Zuckerberg to a caricature of himself, as often occurs in fictional works based on true events and individuals.
Additionally, the movie’s presentation of Harvard should be met with skepticism. For one, it emphasizes final clubs’ significant impact on social life. While it is true that these groups do play a role in the campus party scene, they hardly have the omnipresent influence the film displays. This glimpse into Harvard life, then, highlights an aspect that does not represent the majority of students’ experience here.
“The Social Network” was not filmed at Harvard, and for good reason. The administration’s general stance against allowing filming on campus should be lauded: In addition to the inevitable disruption of hosting an expensive movie’s cast and crew (à la “Love Story”), we do not believe that doing so would decrease stereotypes about the university. Fictional films like “The Social Network” do not seek to portray the real Harvard and are unlikely to generate an objective portrait regardless of the location of the set. Ultimately, a more shocking Harvard is far more marketable than the real thing, and “The Social Network” is no exception.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While mostly frustrating and depressing, the ongoing debate over how to handle the expiring Bush tax cuts has been educational in at least one way. I honestly did not realize how many people think someone earning $250,000 a year does not qualify as “rich.” The cutoff is important, as the Obama administration is proposing letting tax cuts on those above that income expire, but some in Congress are insisting that people who make more than about 98 percent of Americans aren’t wealthy. Jim A. Himes ’88, a congressman from Connecticut and, relevantly, a former Goldman Sachs vice president, said that $250,000 a year doesn’t make one “really rich.” Senate Minority Leader A. Mitch McConnell introduced a plan to extend all the Bush cuts—and increase the national debt by $4 trillion–by claiming Obama’s plan would target “the people who’ve been hit hardest by this recession” (a claim he later was forced to retract, excuse me, “clarify”).
Suffice it to say, if you’re making over $250,000 a year, you have not been hit harder than the millions of workers who’ve run out of unemployment benefits or the tens of thousands of families who have been forced into homeless shelters over the past two years. And if you’re making that much and still inclined to deny your place among the rich, stop. Just stop. Just 2.1 percent of households earn over $250,000 a year. They earned almost five times the income–$52,029–of the median household in 2008. As writer Daniel Gross says, “You’re rich. Get over it.”
That said, the delusion that $250,000-a-year earners aren’t rich has its causes. Most importantly, the happiness one gains from income comes not from its objective benefits so much as from where it places the income-earner in relation to his neighbors. This point, stressed most prominently by the economist Robert H. Frank, is called the “relative income effect” and has a large empirical literature backing it up, a literature that also suggests relative income affects happiness much more than absolute income. What’s more, the economist Michael T. McBride has found that the effect is stronger among high-income individuals. Put more simply, having money doesn’t make us happy. Having more money than our neighbors makes us happy. And having more money than our neighbors makes us especially happy if we have a lot of money, period.
Obviously, people earning $250,000 a year are making a lot more than most people. But the gap between them and those making even more–the super-rich–has actually grown faster than the gap between the merely rich and the middle class. Data compiled by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, and available at Saez’s website, shows that, since 1970, the percentage of total income held by the top ten percent of household has increased from 31.6 percent to 45.6 percent and that held by the top five percent from 20.4 percent to 33.4 percent. But the gains within the top five percent are even more dramatic. The top one percent more than doubled its share, from 7.8 percent to 17.7 percent. So did the top half of one percent, from 5.2 percent to 13.8 percent. Most shockingly of all, the top 0.01 percent of households, representing one ten thousandth of the nation, went from having 0.53 percent of the country’s wealth to having 3.34 percent. The biggest gains, then, go not to the rich but to the super-rich. When the even wealthier are moving ahead faster than they are, it’s easy for the merely rich to feel somehow beleaguered.
Luckily, there is a way to constructively harness this resentment and in the process tamp down on this kind of out of control income inequality. The current top tax bracket—35 percent now, 39.6 percent if the high-income Bush tax cuts expire—affects income above $379,650. Thus, some of the merely rich are taxed at the same marginal rate as the super-rich, allowing runaway inequality and stoking resentment among the merely rich.
There’s no reason we can’t create still higher tax brackets for people making over $600,000, over $1,000,000, over $1,500,000, and so forth. In fact, there is no reason we cannot create infinite tax brackets by setting a tax function and taking the integral to find each person’s tax burden. This would require computerized returns, of course, but if the Internal Revenue Service sent pre-filled out returns to taxpayers, as Obama advisor Austan D. Goolsbee has proposed, that would not be a problem. The government already knows what income most taxpayers receive and what deductions they can take before they file. It would be simple enough to have the IRS do our taxes for us, mail them to us to confirm, and spare taxpayers from doing the calculus needed.
While there’s little sign that integrals will find their way into our tax policy anytime soon, there are reports that Congressional Democrats are considering a “millionaire’s” tax bracket for high earners. That would go a long way toward solving our debt problem, and keep the super-rich from pulling still further ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Most great nations, at the peak of their economic power, become arrogant and wage great world wars at great cost, wasting vast resources, taking on huge debt, and ultimately burning themselves out.”
The above quote from Kevin Phillips in “Wealth and Democracy” should serve as a dire warning to those that love this country of America and all that it stands for. As our government begins its preparation to conclude the war in Afghanistan, the question shifts from whether or not we executed a successful war strategy but whether or not we closed ranks and got out in time. I say that the time to get out of Afghanistan was yesterday, and in many ways, it may be a moot point, because the war is already lost. Let me explain: A key principle to Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” is that the battle should be won before the first shot is fired, requiring a thorough knowledge of oneself, and one’s enemy. The horrific attacks of 9/11 have already achieved the effect that Osama bin Laden intended for them to have. Bin Laden knew there was no possibility that he could defeat the mighty American army in head-to-head combat, but that was never his intent. In fact, he made his objective very clear. Since he could not wreck America militarily, he would wreck it economically, by agency of a never-ending war that we could ill afford to conduct. And so bin Laden went about his work, using a few thousand dollars to launch incredibly devastating attacks on three institutions of American power: financial, military, and political. The result was two trillion-dollar wars and domestic Keynesian spending deficits that have left America staring over the cliff of bankruptcy, turning his enemy’s apparent strength against itself.
Our tactics and strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq were akin to us playing checkers, while our enemies were playing chess. For example, although the 9/11 attacks could have been launched from any location in the world, bin Laden chose to establish his headquarters in the rough and rugged terrain of Afghanistan. This decision was no coincidence and was made with America in mind. As the German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel cynically stated, "What experience and history teach us is this—that people and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it." In essence, those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. Bin Laden knew that the attacks would lure America into the Afghan backlands, after him and his leadership command, and this was a key tenet that his plot hinged on. He knew that the Median and Persian Empires, Alexander the Great, the Seleucids, the Indo-Greeks, Turks, Genghis Khan and the Mongols, British, and Soviets, had all of met their demise in Afghanistan.
Every taunt of President George W. Bush and every message released to the American public was meant to keep us in the fight, ever longer, ever more expensive. It did not help that the Bush administration coined and cloaked the conflict and their subsequent global actions as, “the war on terror,” a maneuver that served bin Laden’s agenda well. The cultural cue that most Americans missed was that there is no such thing as a “war on terror.” The phrase “war on terror” is a convenient catch-all term that can cover everything and nothing at the same time. It is a metaphorical statement, but metaphorical statements can only result in metaphorical, not real, victories. This was how the Bush administration was able to keep us in a perpetual war, in the land where “empires go to die,” to the tune of billions a day. There was never a way that the country could ever sustain that kind of debt burden, especially with President Bush bearing the dubious distinction of being the only president in American history to enact a tax cut during a time of war. We have been seeing the effects of bin Laden’s schemes for some time now, as the deficit continues to soar, unemployment rises, people are uneasy, and we remain mired in the worst economic rut since the great depression. Every day that our troops are engaged in the war, we lose, because we are playing on bin Laden’s terms, on his turf.
President Barack H. Obama is a thinking man, and although he did not get us into the war, he has pledged to get us out. His administration does not look at the war through rose-colored glasses, and has acknowledged that a traditional victory in Afghanistan will not happen. My only plea to him is to accelerate the schedule, because the war has always been about money and goading America into spending itself into oblivion. As stated by Milton Bearden, former Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Pakistan, "The United States must proceed with caution—or end up on the ash heap of Afghan history."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the summer, two New York courts rejected a complaint by Roy Den Hollander, a lawyer himself and a self-proclaimed “anti-feminist,” that “ladies’ nights” at bars and clubs discriminate against men by forcing them to pay more. Hollander, who admitted to taking hip-hop classes simply ‘to meet hot chicks’ and suspects that his conviction for men’s rights stems from his astrological sign (Libra), is not the most scholarly advocate for ending ladies’ nights. But he’s right. This gender-based system of payment does discriminate against men, but more importantly, it continues the system of sexual objectification of women as differentiated from men. 
Ladies’ nights are not a manifestation of women’s liberation. Though veiled as events designed to pamper women—a treat—they in fact serve as a cattle call to increase the female-to-male ratio. Advertising a ladies’ night will bring in women looking to save money and will bring in men looking for women. Arguably, the women who go to ladies’ nights may also be interested in pursuing men there, but the system is designed to favor a male’s chances of finding a female partner. Women’s primary value on ladies’ nights is as sexualized objects of attraction for men, not as paying customers.
One sees this same system of gender-discrimination at most of Harvard’s male final clubs where non-member males are denied entry, and women are welcomed with open arms. Again, the delusion that such attention paid to women makes them special veils the reality that the men still control the activities in the club, as well as the access to alcohol, in order to maximize their own chances of success with women. I am not arguing against the hook-up culture that is prevalent in bars and Harvard’s final clubs. In fact, some research suggests that couples who meet over a drunken one-night stand and get married produce the happiest, most long-lasting marriages. My point is that such a culture should be housed in an environment that is favorable to everyone, not just to males.
Although on average women make 22 percent less money than men, single women under 30 now make eight percent more than men in that same age bracket. The argument that women are economically disadvantaged compared to men, and that women are in need of a ‘subsidy’ from the bar or a man is as ludicrous as it is antiquated. Women, especially young women, can buy their own drinks. Buying someone a drink is not a one-way street, either. Coming from either gender (or even a friend), a free drink is a generally welcomed gesture of interest or simply friendliness.
As the courts upheld, the government has no right to decide how businesses regulate their door prices. But women do have the choice of whether to frequent establishments that hold ‘ladies’ nights.’ Sure, this matter is not more important than looming issues like America’s foreign wars, healthcare, or the economy, but when women buy into these gender-discriminating practices, a subtle, insidious version of sexism pervades society. Last week’s episode of the TV show Mad Men, set in the 1960’s, had Peggy telling a male friend that she can’t get into many of the social venues where her male colleagues do business: “The university club said the only way I could eat dinner there is if I jumped out of a cake.” Sexism in contemporary social establishments is no longer as blatant, but it is still just as threatening to equality between men and women. Everyone should pay the same price, regardless of gender.

Students temporarily evacuated Memorial Hall yesterday morning after a fire alarm that was not triggered by an actual fire went off in the building.
The alarm rang around 11:45 a.m., causing students at lunch in Annenberg Hall, in Sanders Theatre for Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice,” and in other classes throughout Memorial Hall to file outside.
Onlookers surmised that the steam rising from the back of Memorial Hall had something to do with the alarm, but the connection could not be confirmed.
Two fire trucks and a police van responded to the alarm within several minutes. The responders found no evidence of fire or any other disruption, and the public was allowed back into the building within 20 minutes.
A University spokesperson, who did not wish to be identified, said that a fire suppression system in the kitchen sent a signal to the fire alarm for an unknown reason.
“Essentially, the fire alarm got a signal from the thing that something was not perfect,” the individual said. “As a precautionary measure, it just says, ‘Get out of here.’”
Emergency personnel found that the fire suppression system was intact after the incident, according to the spokesperson.
Students said that the evacuation of Justice, the largest class in the College with 805 enrolled students, proceeded without pandemonium. Many thought that the alarm was a drill and consequently did not react in fear.
“People were still talking about libertarianism and rights, so even in emergencies people were still pretty engrossed in the class,” said Kris S. Liu ’14. “Discussions like that can’t wait, you know.”
According to Justice student James D. Carey ’14, the class’ members “reluctantly and slowly got out of their seats, packed up, and left.” Carey said that he exited through the fire escape, along with other students.
“The fire alarm went off just as we were about to emerge from John Locke’s ‘state of nature,’” course professor Michael J. Sandel wrote in an e-mailed statement. “Now we’ll all be in suspense until Wednesday.”
The dining hall staff was “chasing” diners out of Annenberg, according to Ian Chang ’14, who had just entered the hall when the alarm sounded.
“I had a plateful of food that I hadn’t even touched,” said Omar Mesina ’14.

While the Cambridge Public School District achieved “high” and “moderate” aggregate Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System scores, for another year many subgroups at multiple grade levels have failed to meet the No Child Left Behind Act’s standards.
Despite the fact that the district spends $25,000 on each student, more than almost any other district in Mass., Cambridge test scores continue to show an achievement gap between white and minority students. Minority students make up 63.6 percent of the district’s enrollment.
At Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, the district’s high school, only one subgroup in each of the two subjects—Hispanic/Latino for English Language Arts and Special Education for Mathematics—did not make Adequate Yearly Progress according to the standards set by NCLB.
But MCAS results showed that at every grade span at least one subgroup—Asian and Pacific Islander, African-American/Black, Formerly/Limited English Proficient, Hispanic/Latino, Low Income, Special Education, or White—did not make AYP for both English Language Arts and Mathematics.
While the district achieved a “high” composite performance index—a measure of aggregate student scores—for English Language Arts, it still did not meet improvement expectations for all subgroups. For the second year in a row, some failed to make AYP in the subject.
Similarly, while the district scored a “moderate” composite performance index for Mathematics, it did not make AYP for all subgroups for the third year in a row.
“The gaps are persistent and pernicious, and we have not over the last several years made as much progress as we need to and as we intend to,” said Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young.
The district plans to implement a professional development program that will “provide teachers with the support they need to expand their repertoire of teaching strategies so they can be useful to all of the diverse learners in their classrooms,” Young said. Cambridge Public School Committee members said that there is no silver bullet to solve the complex problems associated with the achievement gap.
Committee member Marc C. McGovern, who described closing the achievement gap as “an ongoing process,” said that he and Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker plan to collaborate on another committee that will examine early child education and care in Cambridge.
“All of the research is clear that children who receive quality early childhood education, wherever it comes from, those students do better in school,” McGovern said, adding that a child who enters school with a vocabulary of 1,000 words fewer than another student will already have a problem catching up. But McGovern cautioned that the MCAS scores do not provide a comprehensive picture of education in the district.
“The consequences of not doing well on the MCAS are so great for students and schools that it forces districts to teach to the test more than they should,” he said, adding that the district works to strike a balance between improving MCAS scores and keeping the curriculum engaging.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s announcement that former University President Lawrence H. Summers would leave his post as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama touched off a frenzy of discussion as to whether Summers had decided to leave the White House as part of a response to growing dissatisfaction with the administration, or to keep tenure at the University.
At Harvard, a professor can take a leave of absence of two years without losing tenure. Once that period is up, the professor would have to reapply.
The Obama administration emphasized Harvard’s policy in its announcement that Summers would resign his post, but many critics publicly wondered whether  the University could not have made an exception for someone of Summers’ stature.
The answer, University officials and professors said, is no. The University has not granted extensions to the policy in the past—even for some of its most prominent faculty members.
“As the saying goes: they wouldn’t do it for Henry Kissinger so they won’t do it for anyone else,” said John Y. Campbell, chair of the economics department.
Harvard has a long history of sending its professors to serve in Washington, D.C., and the University has an equally long history of professors suddenly resigning glamorous positions to return to Cambridge and resume their teaching responsibilities.
Legendary Harvard Professor John Kenneth Galbraith once took a position in India in the Kennedy administration, according to Kennedy School Professor Jeffrey B. Liebman, but quickly resigned that position when he realized that he risked losing tenure if he did not return to the University.
Summers himself is no stranger to the policy. When he left for a position in the Clinton administration in 1993, Summers resigned his faculty appointment—thereby losing tenure—according to University spokesperson John D. Longbrake.
When Summers, who at 28 was one of the youngest tenured professors in Harvard’s history, returned in 2001 to assume the University Presidency, he was reappointed to the economics department. Following his resignation as University President in 2006, Harvard elevated him to the position of University Professor, one of the faculty’s most prestigious appointments.
It is unclear exactly what teaching responsibilities Summers will assume upon his return, but a statement by Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 hinted that he will resume teaching at the school.
Summers began working for the Obama administration during the presidential campaign when he regularly briefed the presidential candidate on what was then a rapidly souring economy. During his time in the White House, Summers chaired Obama’s National Economic Council, played a key role in crafting the $787 billion stimulus package, and oversaw the administration’s bailout of the auto industry.

Graduate School of Education professor emeritus Gerald S. Lesser, a legendary educator and curriculum developer for the children’s television show “Sesame Street,” died on Thursday. He was 84.
Lesser—described by former student Joseph H. Blatt ’70 as a “real visionary who didn’t stop innovating”—joined the Ed School faculty in 1963, where he taught developmental psychology and its application to education until he retired in 1998.
Lesser chaired the Ed School’s Human Development Program, which had focused entirely on cross-cultural studies of child rearing.
Over the following decade, Lesser added faculty in many other specialties more directly related to educational practice, including educational television.
“He crossed the boundary from research to practice,” said Education Professor Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, who described Lesser as a “pragmatist.” “He was interested in what he knew and how he could use that knowledge to change the world.”
While at Harvard, Lesser also served as chairman of the Children’s Television Workshop’s board of advisors from 1969 to 1996. In 1974, Lesser published a book, “Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street.”
“He was instrumental in forwarding the idea of ‘edutainment,’” said Ed School graduate Charlotte F. Cole, vice president of international education, research, and outreach at what is now called the Sesame Workshop.
“He was instrumental in building the Sesame Workshop model, which was the bringing together of educators and researchers to work directly on a production process,” she said. “They were actually members of the production team.”
“At a time during the 1970s when the Ed School had serious financial problems,” said Ed School Professor Emeritus Robert A. LeVine, “‘Sesame Street’ stood out as its outstanding contribution to American education—though it was not directly related to American public schools.”
Lesser’s devotion to his work with children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, was evident in his persistence in developing programming material that would help give all children a chance to develop and reach their highest potential.
“He really saw ‘Sesame Street’ as a vehicle for giving all children a chance [to learn] in a way that was fun and engaging and meaningful to them culturally,” Cole said.
Lesser had an “excellent sense of humor” and had the ability to get people to communicate across their various areas of expertise, according to Blatt, director of the Ed School’s Technology, Innovation, and Education Masters Program.
“He taught us that researching, designing, producing, and testing learning materials for 4-year-olds requires every bit of creativity, dedication, and wisdom that we could muster,” Blatt wrote in a tribute to his mentor, “and that the work is more rewarding and more fun than we could have imagined.”
Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney holds the Gerald S. Lesser Professorship in Early Childhood Development.
“The first time I met Gerry Lesser, he joked that he was sorry to have saddled me with the name ‘Lesser Professor,” McCartney wrote in an e-mail to the Ed School faculty and staff. “[H]e also told me how proud he was that the dean of the school was serving in the chair that honored him. But I am the one who is proud to carry his name along with mine.”
“When I first saw a Harvard professor laugh out loud at Cookie Monster, I was hooked,” Blatt wrote in his tribute, “and as Gerry’s friends and students will understand, I learned that you could do important work while wearing sneakers everywhere.”
Lesser is survived by his wife, his children and their families.

Better known to many of his peers as Burgerman, Samuel B. Novey ’11 will serve as first class marshal for the class of 2011, the Harvard Alumni Association announced today.
Novey and Second Class Marshal Moira E. Forberg ’11 will work with the six other students elected to the Senior Class Committee to plan Senior Week activities, choose the Class Day speaker, and represent the class of 2011 within the Harvard Alumni Association.
The six other marshals are Talal M. Alhammad ’11, Robert G.B. Long ’11, Tobias S. Stein ’11, Kurt Tsuo ’11, Vidya B. Viswanathan ’11, and Tian Wen ’11.
Novey said that his primary goal as first class marshal is to foster class unity, and expressed enthusiasm at the caliber of his fellow marshals.
“Today the people chose epic,” Novey said. “I hope they continue making that choice.”
Several of the marshals ran campaigns on Facebook, and one of Long’s heavily publicized promises may be the most eagerly anticipated by his classmates: his pledge to “ice” University President Drew G. Faust—a prank involving the presentation of a bottle of Smirnotff Ice that the recipient must immediately drink.
“The first feeling I had upon finding out was excitement. Then I realized that, because of my campaign promise, now I actually have to ice President Drew Faust,” Long said. “My only concern is that she reads this article and comes prepared with a counter-ice—although that will probably make it even more epic.”
The announcement came as a surprise to several of the marshals, who found out about their election when they surreptitiously checked their cell phones during class.
Stepping out of his graduate seminar on Middle Eastern Studies to use the bathroom, Alhammad discovered a message from fellow marshal Stein informing him of the good news.
“I was really, really excited—I had to contain myself for the rest of class,” Alhammad said.
Viswanathan, an inactive Crimson news editor, said she was initially puzzled by the deluge of messages when she first glanced at her phone.
The selection of the Class Day speaker will be a top priority, according to Stein and Viswanathan.
Drawing on her experience at two prior Harvard commencements, Viswanathan emphasized the value of humor in a Class Day speech: “Tina Fey, Jon Stewart, or Stephen Colbert would be amazing,” she said.
The eight class marshals will be joined on the Senior Class Committee by 13 House representatives, who will be elected next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council debated at yesterday’s meeting whether to pass a proposal that would allow certain companies to post signs on the exterior of their buildings with the permission of the city.
The General Waiver of Sign Limitations proposal permits companies that hold at least 25 percent of the building’s leasable space to post city-approved signs on a first-come, first-serve basis. Buildings are allowed at most two signs, and companies are allowed at most one.
While introduced as a measure that would increase residents’ quality of life, the proposal—which was introduced last May, according to Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.—faced great opposition by the public.
Carol O’Hare, a Cambridegport resident, recommended that the City Council revise the proposal to better reflect the proposal’s intent to prevent “eyesore signs.”
Residents were also concerned about the size of the signs, which were limited to 60 to 90 feet in height.
Cambridge resident Kevin P. Crane said the signs may create an atmosphere that was atypical of Cambridge, adding that he opposed allowing lights on “large, high signs.”
“I thought Cambridge wanted to be green,” Crane said. “Doesn’t this contradict it?”
But several City Council members said yesterday that they believed the proposal could improve the quality of life in Cambridge.
Toomey argued that the signs would not create a “Las Vegas type of atmosphere,” and his colleague, councillor Marjorie C. Decker, added that they would contribute to the “funkiness” of the city.
“We’re trying to tighten the regulations,” Councillor Leland L. Cheung said, opposing the view that neon lights and billboards will be pervasive.
Other Council members such as Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis urged that the City Council move soon to vote on the issue, which had been discussed in seven public hearings.
“I have received more e-mails on this than any other issue,” Decker said in agreement. “There are more pressing issues that affect the environment, the quality of life, and the city. I’d be glad to vote on this and move on.”
Both Council members and residents agreed that the proposal in its current form had several gaps, including how long signs can stay up. Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher recommended a specific time be set for the owner to remove the sign.
Others including Councillor Craig A. Kelley and resident Marcucella agreed that the proposal is being rushed and that it is important to communicate with the public the impact the proposed Zoning amendments might have.
While seven public hearings had been held on the topic, Marcucella found “the summertime meetings and proceedings to be antithetical to the education of an informed public.”

Plans for formal programming for this year’s inaugural Optional Winter Activities Week—which runs from Jan. 16 until the beginning of spring semester—have begun to take shape, with both student-initiated and University-sponsored events confirmed for the period.
The University is organizing a pilot series of art-intensive programs for OWAW, with offerings in theater, dance, creative writing, design, music, and comedy, according to Lori E. Gross, associate provost of arts and culture.
“The art intensives...offer students the opportunity to have hands-on arts-making experiences that are not available during the fall or spring semesters,” Gross wrote in an e-mail.
For example, the dance workshop will be led by a choreographer from the American Repertory Theater and will focus on personal narratives in dance, said Office of the Arts Dance Director Elizabeth Bergmann.
The OWAW arts intensives are part of University President Drew G. Faust’s arts-making initiative and will be financed with University funding specifically dedicated to supporting arts events. All students will be able to apply to participate in the programming without cost, according to Gross.
“We hope that they will be successful and will be continued in future years,” Gross wrote about the programs.
Aside from the arts offerings, the majority of the programming available during OWAW is expected to be organized by students.
Students do not need to apply for approval to be on campus during the week before classes begin, as OWAW is open to all undergraduates. But Office of International Programs Assistant Director Erin E. Goodman, who is coordinating winter break activities for the College, said she encourages students and student groups interested in hosting programming to submit their proposal through the College’s winter break portal.
“We would like to hear about as many events as possible, because we want to be informed about what kinds of activities students would like to have,” Goodman said.
“Just like last year, there will be a review process of what happened during this winter break,” said College spokesman Jeff Neal. “To the extent that students show a desire to participate during events [during OWAW], that will inform planning for the future.”
The portal opened earlier this month, and yesterday administrators approved the first activity—volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter through the Phillips Brooks House Association, according to Goodman. Approved events will be listed on the College’s official events calendar.
In addition, students holding events can request assistance finding space for their events from the Office of Student Life, according to Goodman.
Applications for events during OWAW must be submitted by Dec. 3 to be reviewed by the College and posted on the official online portal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Mo. will soon be getting an update courtesy of a team led by Harvard Graduate School of Design Professor Michael R. Van Valkenburgh.
Van Valkenburgh’s landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, was selected from a pool of 49 international architecture firms to redesign the area around the Arch—also known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial—as part of a five-year plan to renew the monument’s surroundings and connect St. Louis to East St. Louis, which is on the other side of the Mississippi River in Ill.
Van Valkenburgh’s firm tackled the challenge of connecting St. Louis with East St. Louis across the Mississippi River while retaining the arch’s character.
Van Valkenburgh said his team’s ideas for the area include stretching the arch, incorporating an aviary, and creating an elevated garden with a plant-lined walkway.
Jury member and Smithsonian curator Cara McCarty called Van Valkenburgh’s proposal “refined and intelligent.” The design was chosen over four other bids in the final round.
“It was not just a park, it was an urban solution,” McCarty said.
Valkenburgh, a “professor in practice” in the School of Design’s department of landscape architecture, said he is excited to begin implementing his team’s new design. He added that he feels the project will help advance the agendas of natural parks in the United States.
“This [project] deals with gnarly problems...the issues of our times,” Valkenburgh said.
His firm, which has offices in both Brooklyn and in Cambridge, advertises itself as a leader in the new “ecological-urban paradigm” and has been selected for over 350 international architecture projects, including the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House and restoration of Harvard Yard.
He said his latest project could serve as an example of how eco-urbanism can transform cities.
“It’s an amazing honor,” he said. “I can only imagine it will be the project of my lifetime.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: September 28, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 28 news article "GSD Professor's Firm To Redesign Area Around Gateway Arch" incorrectly called Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates a construction firm. In fact, it is a landscape architecture firm.

In high school, Georgia H.A. Shelton ’14 was not actively involved with the Jewish community. Her hometown in Okla. did not have a large Muslim population, and she certainly had never slept in a sukkah, a temporary hut built during the Jewish harvest festival Sukkot.
But that all changed when she joined Harvard Hillel this fall.
Shelton visited Hillel last night for the annual Sukkat Salaam, an interfaith dinner and dialogue between members of Hillel and the Harvard Islamic Society. At the event, she sang “Od Yavo Shalom Aleinu,” or “Peace will come upon us,” in both Hebrew and Arabic.
During the song, the atmosphere in Hillel became festive as guests clapped their hands, tapped their feet, and nodded their heads in unison.
“It was amazing to see how some words in Hebrew and Arabic were the same, like ‘salaam,’” Shelton said, referring to the word for “peace.”
Sukkat Salaam is a student-run event that started six years ago to foster interfaith understanding while celebrating the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, and the start of Sukkot. The event provides members of the two faiths an opportunity to eat together and meet on a personal level.
“It’s nice to see students of various backgrounds collaborating and hosting this event every year,” Hillel Rabbanit Sharon Weiss-Greenberg said.
Though the original plan was to hold the event in the sukkah in the Hillel courtyard, the rain forced the participants to move inside.
Attendants enjoyed a kosher meal from the Hillel dining hall­—chicken gyros, falafel, and apple kugel—while listening to a performance by Harvard’s Jewish a cappella group Shani, readings from religious texts, and a speech from Rachel Tal, director of English studies for Israel’s Amal Network of schools.
In her speech, Tal spoke about educational programs she designed in the Middle East to bring Jewish, Arab, and Bedouin students together in a network of 60 high schools.
“We provide a place for students to build friendship,” she said. “We teach languages—Hebrew, Arabic, and English—as an instrument to bridge the differences.”
Abdelnasser Rashid ’12, president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said he hopes that the event helped Jewish and Muslim students at Harvard to develop similar meaningful connections.

Former Mass Governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis and former ABC World News Anchor Charles Gibson were among five panelists who spoke at an Institute of Politics forum last night about the role of the presidential debate in the American political process.
The question of what place television debates hold in the current political process seemed to loom on the panelists’ minds from the beginning, when moderator Carl M. Cannon—the executive editor of PoliticsDaily.com—showed a clip from the first televised presidential debate, held between John F. Kennedy ’40 and Richard Nixon in 1960.
The forum quickly evolved into a debate itself, centering on the future of campaign politics in a world permeated by social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
The panelists shared their different perspectives on the presidential debate process: Mike McCurry, co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates and former press secretary to former President Bill Clinton, Senior Advisor to the McCain-Palin presidential campaign Nicolle Wallace, and Personal Democracy Forum founder Andrew Rasiej also took part in the forum.
Rasiej, who voiced the most enthusiasm for new social networking technologies, said that these tools will enable American citizens to not only feel more engaged with the candidates themselves, but also feel more compelled to actively participate in the political and campaign process.
“It’s about reinventing democracy in the 21st century,” Rasiej said.
Other panelists were more skeptical of the viability of social networking as a political strategy. McCurry insisted on the importance of televised debates between candidates in allowing voters to watch their leaders interact with each other and speak on a public stage.
Later, when Rasiej brought up the use of technologies in the 2008 presidential debates that allowed viewers to submit questions directly to candidates, Gibson pointed out how many such opportunities for direct dialogue became dominated with comments and questions that were pure “vitriol.”
Conflicting evidence emerged when Rasiej asked audience members how many of them have Twitters and Facebooks, and how many would feel more engaged with a candidate through these mediums. The show of hands was a clear majority in both cases.
Simon M. Thompson ’14 echoed the majority sentiment, citing Obama’s use of social networking to raise funds from a broad base of young voters as just another example of how such websites could make voters feel more engaged in the political process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ninety years after the University began persecuting homosexual undergraduates in the infamous “Secret Court,” a group of Harvard students and affiliates have launched a movement to award those seven expelled students—two of whom committed suicide—posthumous honorary degrees at this year’s commencement.
Initiated by former University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and his administration, the “Secret Court” convened for the first time in 1920 to investigate charges of homosexuality on campus. Its actions were unknown until 2002, when The Crimson published a feature on the court, which originally expelled nine students and readmitted two.
The recent movement—called “Their Day in the Yard”—was launched in June 2010 by a “student of Harvard University, who wants to help the expelled students achieve the recognition that they deserve, before she graduates,” according to its website.
This “student of Harvard University” says in an interview that she wishes to remain to anonymous because of her affiliation with the University as an Extension School student. Since the summer, however, she says she has collaborated with Jacob M. Krueger, a student at the Divinity School, and Stan Richardson, who wrote a play based on the events of the Secret Court that premiered several weeks ago in New York City.
Originally a Facebook petition, “Their Day in the Yard” has now launched its own website and begun to win support within the Harvard community. Faculty members such as Sociology Lecturer Kaia Stern have signed their names to the petition, which now has 270 supporters.
“I wholeheartedly encourage others to spread the word,” wrote Stern in a post on the movement’s website, “so that we can finally give these seven students ‘Their Day in the Yard.’”
REMEMBERING THE PAST
Unsatisfied with the formal apology issued by former University President Lawrence H. Summers on behalf of Harvard after The Crimson reported on the Secret Court in 2002, the Extension School student says that she hopes the persecuted students from the 1920s will not merely be awarded degrees but honorary degrees this coming May.
“I applaud [Summers] for making the statement, but I don’t think it’s enough,” she says. “I don’t want to forget it. I want to learn from it...I want to see Harvard grow from it.”
“An actual degree would be better than nothing, but their reputation has been damaged so badly by Harvard,” the individual adds. “The best way to correct it would be to bestow honor upon them with a special degree. If I was the president of Harvard, this is what I would do.”
But Harvard’s actual president does not necessarily agree about how best to remember the past.
In an interview, University President Drew G. Faust says that although Harvard has rarely given posthumous degrees to people other than “John Adams or someone like that,” the issue is likely to inspire discussion if it is brought up.
“What should Harvard do about things in the past? Issues like excluding women or blacks? There’s a long history—how do you think about what the past has been?” Faust says. “What I’d like to do is to direct our attention and learn from the past in order to inspire ourselves to be better in the future, because the present and the future is what matters.”
History shapes how we approach the present, but we can’t undo the past,” she adds. “What we can do is make sure that we learn from it.”
According to Jeff A. Neal, spokesman for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, FAS does not award posthumous degrees except in the rare case of a student who completes all academic requirements for the degree but dies before the degree has been conferred.
Richardson and the Extension School student maintain that most, if not all, of the expelled students were in good standing to graduate before the Court expelled them from the College and ruined their reputations. Some, they says, were just a few weeks shy of completing their degree requirements.
Richardson, who leafed through hundreds of pages of archival material in researching “Veritas,” his recent award-winning play on the subject, says that “a couple of the guys were like five days from graduating.” He offered the example of Keith P. Smerage ’21, who was expelled for homosexual activity and committed suicide 10 years later without the Harvard degree he would have earned had the University not terminated his career.
“He was so eloquent in his hopes for himself, what he thought Harvard could do for him and what he could do for the world,” Richardson says of Smerage. “He just couldn’t pull it together after this and committed suicide 10 years later.”
WAITING FOR CHANGE
On campus, the queer community is awaiting the University’s decision and pondering the implications of continued silence from Massachusetts Hall.
“Frankly, I can’t imagine a viable argument for not awarding these posthumous degrees,” says Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who serves on the board of directors of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus. “It’s too little, too late, of course, but late is better than never.”
“I would be curious to see what the justification for refusal would be, and what a suggested alternative would be,” says Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of Harvard Queer Students and Allies.
Richardson, who is not a Harvard affiliate, says that a refusal to grant these posthumous degrees would send a “really terrible message to students at Harvard right now who are LGBT, who would have been rooted out 90 years ago.”
“If Harvard doesn’t grant these, they’re saying that this is just not as important as the people we’re granting awards to this year,” Richardson says. “Why should Meryl Streep, Whoopi Goldberg, or—I don’t know—Lady Gaga receive an honorary degree from Harvard next May?”
LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE
Thus far, Krueger—a longtime friend of Richardson’s—says that “Their Day in the Yard” will first attempt to join forces with the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus before contacting the administration.
“Once we find out who our supporters are, we can contact the administration,” Kruger says.
The movement has set a tentative deadline of the 2011 Commencement—when the Extension School student will earn her own diploma—to persuade the administration to award the honorary degrees.
“I just realized that I didn’t really want to graduate from an institution that wouldn’t acknowledge its history like this,” she says. “I’m surprisingly optimistic that this is possible. I have to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baroness Catherine Ashton discussed the future of the European Union’s foreign policy in light of international economic, political, and environmental challenges before a full auditorium at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum last night.
“The future of Europe depends on the security and sustainability that we are able to create in the rest of the world,” said Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. “The problems that we face are global, and if we are going to find solutions to these problems, we need to be a cohesive unit able to work together in partnership.”
Ashton—whose position is often likened to being the foreign minister of  the EU—said that she believes the EU should confront these issues through conflict prevention, climate change security, crisis management, and humanitarian aid, both within Europe and abroad.
In particular, she noted that the EU played a key role in providing humanitarian aid to Haiti earlier this year and said she believes the European community will have a pivotal role in encouraging dialogue in Serbia and Kosovo to bring about a compromise in the region.
In an interview after her speech, Ashton said that “bringing together resources is a significant part of what I think Europe should be doing,” referring to both improving crisis management and pooling developmental aid.
Ashton said that economic sustainability—building strong economic links—for the people in Europe comes in large part from the strength of the relationship with other countries.
To date, 16 European countries have adopted the Euro, which has been one of the region’s biggest economic challenges, according to Ashton. The Euro is “a currency tested in the fire of the economic crisis, particularly what has happened in Greece,” she said.
Patrick J. Leonard ’14—who also attended a breakfast with Ashton yesterday morning—said that he was previously unaware of Ashton’s role within the European Union, but that she was adept at explaining the concept of European integration to Americans.
“In order for the EU to achieve its objectives, it is important that citizens of foreign nations understand its promise,” he said.
“I think the European Union was more an American dream than it was a European dream,” Ashton said, pointing to the post-war chaos in Europe and the desire for lasting peace.
Since its creation, the EU has mediated revolutions in former communist countries and notably, these countries did not go through “the pendulum swing to another fall of authoritarian regime, but instead, opted for the European institutions. They joined a common cause: democracy, economic prosperity, and rule of law,” she said.
Europe is finally growing together, she said, as evidenced by the coordinated EU walk-out at the remarks of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about 9/11 at the UN General Assembly last week.

About 25 students debated whether Lady Gaga and Beyoncé have become feminist icons through their pop music at a discussion last night moderated by Radcliffe Institute Fellow and Princeton University professor Daphne A. Brooks.
“Pop culture music is a place where patriarchy, racism, normalphobia, and homophobia—all the social and political  problems our society has—reside, and reproducing these forms of oppression is problematic,” Brooks said at the Harvard College Women’s Center. “But it has also served as one of the sights for women and queer subjects to criticize and challenge societal phobias and oppression.”
Students analyzed media coverage of the two pop stars, such as magazine covers, interviews and photographs, and discussed whether Lady Gaga was making a radical statement in gracing the cover of Vogue clad only in raw meat.
“I like the irony in this picture. Women are often referred to as a piece of meat, so Lady Gaga wearing raw meat definitely makes a statement,” said Sarina M. Patterson ’14. “But at the same time, it’s just gross.”
Students watched and examined the two artists’ collaboration in the past year and compared  Lady Gaga’s video, “Telephone” which features Beyoncé, and the latter’s  “Videophone” video featuring the former.
"I feel like Beyoncé is such a sex icon. We are obsessed with her image and her body," said Alexandra L.L. Almore ’12. "I think looking at her body next to Lady Gaga's is very interesting.... Lady Gaga is like an anti-sex icon. She almost makes sex scary."
Students also noted that race played a role in the two artists’ self-representation.
Brooks said discussions like yesterday’s are useful tools for students to analyze today’s society and culture: “Students can use the critical thinking tools they are learning in the classroom and apply them to the world around them,” she said.

Former President of Finland and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti O.K. Ahtisaari received the 2010 Great Negotiator Award last night in recognition of his achievements in international diplomacy.
Harvard Law School’s Program on Negotiation and the Harvard Kennedy School’s The Future of Diplomacy Project presented the award, which is given each year to someone who has contributed to the field of dispute resolution and negotiation.
Ahtisaari has worked to resolve many conflicts, including Namibia’s struggle for independence from the Republic of South Africa, fighting in Kosovo, and hostility between the province Aceh and Indonesia.
Though Ahtisaari cautioned that many peace agreements dissolve a few years later, he said he remains hopeful: “There is no conflict in the world that cannot be solved,” he said.
As part of the event, Ahtisaari engaged in an open discussion about these conflicts with faculty from the Kennedy School, the Harvard Business School, and Tufts University. R. Nicholas Burns, a Kennedy School professor and co-chair of the 2010 Great Negotiator Award Committee, repeatedly praised Ahtisaari for his “clear vision of objectives.”
Ahtisaari emphasized the importance of that trait throughout the discussion: “I knew from the beginning what the outcome was going to be,” he said about the Kosovo negotiations. “Because if you don’t, you can waste the rest of your days on processes.”
Burns also commended Ahtisaari’s “extreme modesty,” a characteristic audience members were also able to glean from the discussion.
“He was very honest, very straightforward, and it was refreshing,” said Extension School student Luis A. Navia. “He’s someone who can admit that his team is essential and who welcomes a challenge.”
“He had a sincere humility that was winning,” said Business School student Jacqueline R. Sandberg.
Ahtisaari, who pretended to drop his award, balanced the serious topics of the night with frequent jokes that elicited laughter from an appreciative audience.

A new secondary field in energy and the environment will likely be available to students by next fall, following a review of the proposed requirements by a diverse group of faculty in the humanities and the sciences.
Students pursuing the secondary field will be required to take one class on energy science, one class on the environment, and two electives which will be drawn from a broad array of courses in the sciences, government, and economics, according to Environmental Science and Engineering Professor Daniel P. Schrag.
“Dealing with climate change—both trying to mitigate it by reducing emissions and adapting to it because some of it is going to happen anyway—those are some of the greatest challenges our society is going to face in the next century,” said Schrag, the primary architect for the new minor. “The idea is to design a secondary field that will encourage as many different students from as many different backgrounds [as possible] to participate.”
Though many involved in the creation of the new minor are affiliated with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Schrag said that the minor will not be offered by SEAS itself.
Instead, due to interdisciplinary nature of studying environmental policy and energy, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will be asked to create a special committee to administer the new secondary field. The proposed requirements will then be voted on by a committee in FAS.
But Schrag said that the greatest challenge facing the potential energy and environment minor is not the approval process, but rather the dearth of faculty in several key areas related to environmental science.
“There is a great need for additional faculty in many areas of energy and the environment—in particular, in energy technology,” said Schrag, adding that faculty members were “stretched very thin” in order to offer classes in that field.
Area Dean for Environmental Science and Engineering Steven C. Wofsy agreed, saying that demand for the new secondary field may help to attract new talent to Harvard in environmental science.
“We really view it as a help in enlarging and modernizing the curriculum,” Wofsy said.
The new secondary field will likely be one of several courses of study in applied science to receive official recognition during her deanship, according to SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray.
A new concentration in biomedical engineering debuted this fall, and Murray has said that she hopes to introduce additional concentrations in electrical engineering and applied physics within the next three years.

An  earlier version of the Sept. 28 news article "Secondary Field in Energy  and Environment May Be Offered" stated that the Faculty of Arts and  Sciences "will create" a committee to administer the secondary field. To  clarify, FAS will be asked to create the committee before such a  definitive action  occurs.
The article also stated that the proposal will be voted on by FAS. To  clarify, a committee within FAS will be reviewing the proposal.

Senior cross country runner Dan Chenoweth began his season the same way he ended it last year—by leaving the rest of the pack in the dust on his way to a decisive victory and a first-place finish.
The competition between Harvard and Yale remains one of the most exciting and classic rivalries in the country, and cross-country is no exception.
The annual dual meet that took place last weekend is one of the most anticipated matchups every year.
This year’s race marked the 98th meeting between the two historic rivals and also served as Chenoweth’s debut for the 2010 season.
“This was an important meet for us,” Chenoweth said. “It wasn’t too difficult of a course to run, but that didn’t mean we could slack off. I came to run, and I came to win, especially against Yale.”
This past weekend, Chenoweth sped through the eight kilometers of the Course at Yale with a time of 25:10.70, taking the title by finishing nearly 25 seconds ahead of the next runner, a significant margin of victory.
“I didn’t do anything different. [I] didn’t change my approach,” Chenoweth said. “I just wanted to go out and hang back, then make my move later and take the lead.”
He not only cruised past the competition, but his time also surpassed the course and meet records, adding more accolades to a lengthy list of accomplishments compiled over his collegiate career.
“I knew what the record was before I started,” Chenoweth said, when asked about setting the new meet and course records. “But it wasn’t an explicit goal of mine. I knew I was getting close, but all I wanted to do was get ahead of Yale and make sure that I got that first-place spot for [the team].”
“I’m not surprised,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “[Chenoweth] is at that level of experience where that kind of record is what he is capable of. I’m at the point where I expect that kind of performance from him every time he comes out.”
Chenoweth ended last season as the 2009 Ivy League Heptagonals Champion, Harvard’s first individual champion since 1995.
He also earned first-team All-Ivy League honors at the Heps for the first time in his career last season.
Undoubtedly, there were high expectations for his performance this season.
After his outing over the weekend, any doubts about what shape he would be in were quickly answered, as Chenoweth picked up right where he left off with a dominant showing in his first race of the year.
“It’s always hard to come out for the first meet of the season,” Chenoweth said. “But it felt really good to come out and run, and see how well I would perform against other strong competitors.”
“He looked better than I had expected,” Saretsky said of Chenoweth’s performance. “He’s an incredibly hard-working young man, and he’s in a great spot. He can be even better than he is right now, and that’s saying something.”
This marks the third time in as many years that Chenoweth has won the dual meet, and the Lowell House resident shows no sign of stopping his winning ways any time soon.
While the race for first place was a blowout in Chenoweth’s favor, his individual performance was not enough to propel the Crimson men past Yale, as the Bulldogs finished with 24 points to Harvard’s 34.
The race also marked the first time the Crimson men were defeated by Yale at the event in the last four years, the first time since Chenoweth began college.
Chenoweth was the only member of the men’s squad to finish in the top four, with the next runners from Harvard finishing in fifth and sixth, respectively.
The captain knows that while the defeat may be partially attributed to inexperience, everyone on the team can perform better and run faster, including himself.
“I’m confident that by the end of the season, all of us guys will have improved,” Chenoweth said. “We’re going to be better, and we’re going to win.”

The Harvard sailing team continued its string of strong performances this past weekend, as the coed squad earned a team victory in at least one regatta for the third consecutive weekend. Staying close to home, a coed contingent captured the Professor Steadman Hood Trophy at Tufts by outpacing the host Jumbos and the rest of the 20-team field by a significant margin of over 30 points, finishing with a final tally of 141 to Tufts’ 173.
“We were able to sail well in both divisions on both days,” junior skipper Brendan Kopp said, “and I think, as a team, we’re really performing well right now.”
The coed squad also sent a group of sailors down to Maryland for the St. Mary’s Fall Intersectional regatta, in which the Crimson finished fifth. Two other contingents also represented Harvard on the weekend and came away with matching finishes of ninth place, as the women’s team had a group of freshmen compete at the Women’s Regis Bowl regatta at Boston University and the coed squad had another group race at MIT in the Commonwealth Invitational as the third installment of the Central Series of racing.
“We competed at two top coed events this weekend,” senior skipper Alan Palmer said. “And we performed well at both. All five of our best skippers got to sail this weekend, which was nice.”
PROFESSOR STEADMAN HOOD TROPHY
Harvard’s top coed sailors finished first at the Professor Steadman Hood Trophy regatta over the weekend, using consistently strong efforts in all 28 races to defeat some of the best teams in New England. The Crimson notched 22 top-five finishes and claimed three race victories over two days of competition.
The A division of racing saw Palmer team up with fellow fourth-year crew Quincy Bock to place second in the division.
“Sailing at Tufts is always hard because it has extremely shifty wind conditions,” Palmer said. “We need to work on keeping our eyes on the course ahead and making faster decisions to the changes that we see in front of us. We were a little reluctant to react in the A division this weekend, and I think that might have cost us a little.”
Captain skipper Tedd Himler and sophomore crew Alma Lafler finished first in the B division after one day of racing, and Kopp and junior crew William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, picked up where they left off on Sunday, helping Harvard bring home top honors in the division.
“We are likely going to see some of the same teams we saw this weekend in the next few weeks,” Kopp said. “So hopefully we can try to continue the streak that were are on.”
ST. MARY’S FALL INTERSECTIONAL
The coed squad sent another group of its top sailors to St. Mary’s College of Maryland over the weekend to compete in the St. Mary’s Fall Intersectional regatta, in which the Crimson finished fifth among 18 teams.
Seniors John Stokes and Meghan Wareham took care of the skippering and crewing duties in the A division, respectively. Junior captain Emily Lambert served as skipper and fellow third-year Marie Appel acted as crew in the B division and finished eighth on the weekend.
WOMEN’S REGIS BOWL
Four freshmen represented the Harvard women’s sailing team at the Women’s Regis Bowl regatta this past weekend at Boston University, and the rookies gained some valuable experience in placing ninth out of 13 teams.
Skipper Morgan Russom and crew Isabel Ruane placed ninth in the A division, while Caitlin Watson and Louisa French served as skipper and crew, respectively, in the B division, in which the duo finished seventh.
COMMONWEALTH INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES THREE
The Crimson had a coed contingent place ninth out of 18 teams at the Commonwealth Invitational held at MIT over the weekend. The underclassmen representatives from Harvard included Sam Millham and Margaret Fulham competing in the A division and Nick Waldo and Jin Zang in the B division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up in a family and a community where sports often dominated television time and conversation. To an extent, this is true for much of Los Angeles—the seasons can be better defined as football, baseball, and basketball than by the traditional four segments of the year.
My academic calendar generally came second in importance to sports too. The start of the school year meant cheering against USC most Saturdays and watching whatever the big networks broadcasted on Sundays. Spring break was usually the start of a six-month love affair with MLB Extra Innings on DirecTV. “One more inning, Mom” was my version of “the check is in the mail.”
During Olympic season every other year, I plan sleep and meals around the NBC programming. This summer, I had no reservations taking an (occasional) extended lunch to watch a World Cup game, even when I had no vested interest in either team on the field.
As a sportsophile, spending February at Harvard was a culture shock. For the first time, I had friends and peers who didn’t watch the Super Bowl just because they didn’t care. During Winter Olympic viewings in the Weld basement, it was often just a Canadian or two who joined me.
Perhaps because most of the Houses have not been renovated since the Truman administration, we have no cable and, as a consequence, little TV culture. Most of what we watch is done on Hulu or Megavideo. When we do our sports viewing, it’s usually a smattering of loyal fans in a JCR or a crowded dorm room with a projector and an antenna.
But this is not to say that sports culture doesn’t exist here—far from it. At a school with more varsity sports than any other in the country, many of us have either lived with athletes or are, at the very least, casual acquaintances with a few of them.
On any given weekend, you’re likely to see at least four kinds of people on the other side of the Charles. The athletes, of course, are the most visible ones. There is always a loyal group of sports boosters and alumni, often clad in khakis or a button-down. The ones who love sports but haven’t been good enough to play competitively since high school (or sometimes Little League) are the Crimson sportswriters. And the proud parents are pretty easy to pick out.
This isn’t to say, though, that there is sports apathy in the rest of the school’s population. More than 20,000 came for the football team’s season-opening night game. Men’s soccer set an attendance record earlier this year. The Game fills up Harvard Stadium every other Saturday before Thanksgiving.
Harvard sports culture is relatively autumn-centric. My guess is that, more than anything else, it’s a weather thing. Single-digit weather has a way of deterring anyone who lives north of Kirkland from embarking on a 15-minute walk to Allston. Basketball draws both fans and interest, but attendance is certainly lighter (in absolute terms, anyway) than any football game. Spring weather is a wild card—sweatshirt days have lighter attendance, t-shirt days draw bigger crowds.
So, for the time being, the fall remains king. But more and more, this is changing. Harvard takes a lot of pride in its sports successes, as the banner celebrating the 1920 Rose Bowl championship demonstrates. If men’s basketball ever makes it to the Tournament, I would imagine that the school would come down with a case of March Madness as serious as last year’s swine flu outbreak. Last April, the stadium had unprecedented spring activity when Duke visited men’s lacrosse.
As successes and fortunes of Harvard teams change, seasonal interest might as well. Way down the road, when (if) the college builds Houses across the river, the weather and the walk might be less of an impediment.
And who knows, the new Houses might even have cable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the men’s soccer team opening its Ancient Eight season at home on Saturday against Yale, the Back Page gives you an opportunity to meet the team’s scoring leader and reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, sophomore forward Brian Rogers. In this exclusive interview, Rogers reveals his love for peanut butter, his desire to be an extinct carnivore, and desired bromance with a Real Madrid star. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Brian Rogers
Year: 2013
Stats: Last year, Rogers played in all 19 games, starting 15. He ranked fifth in the Ancient Eight with18 points and six goals, good enough for Ivy Rookie of the Year and All-Ivy Second Team honors. This year, through seven games, Rogers already has three goals including a game-winning goal in the 80th minute against Stanford in the season opener.
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
Grilled Chicken, whole wheat pasta, salad, and a banana peanut butter sandwich.  I’ve been known to kill an entire jar of peanut butter on my sandwich, which doesn’t make me too popular in the Eliot House dhall.
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I like to listen to a lot of house music, it gets me in that Euro vibe I need to play.  But on the way out to the field for every game I listen, sing out loud, and dance to “Paranoid” by Kanye West with Baba Omosegbon.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
I don’t really have a favorite team to play against.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Can’t say, it could jeopardize my future political career.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the field.
Hitting the cross bar against Dartmouth when I had an open net and was inside the six.  Luckily we still won the game, but my teammates didn’t let me forget about that miss.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I would normally say a cheetah or something, but I’ve always wanted to be a dinosaur ever since I saw Jurassic Park when I was four, so, I’m going to say a T-Rex.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
It’s hard to hear anything over Richard Smith’s yelling from center back.  All I hear during the game is Richard, aka Dickie Smithers, screaming “GET STUCK IN”.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Quidditch.  Our assistant coach showed us a video about them done by The Crimson before a game to get us pumped up.  They’re the hardest working team on campus.
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
Seeker, or at least that’s what I’ve been told.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Probably a heterosexual bro date with Cristiano Ronaldo.  Dude is a beast, and I’m dying to find out his ab routine.

Anticipating the upcoming release of "The Social Network," The Boston Globe reviewed Harvard's relationship with Hollywood, finding that while many movies purport to be at Harvard, few actually make it within the gates.
In light of the release of the movie Friday and the publication of the article, we thought we'd take a look at a little bit of the history of America’s oldest university and the various issues it’s had with Tinseltown over the years.
Love Story (1970) – The classic tale of dumb rich Harvard jock falls for smart scholarship Radcliffe girl, "Love Story"—written by Erich W. Segal ’58—was essentially the last movie to include full footage of the Harvard campus.
A Small Circle of Friends (1980) – Although director Ben Cohen did sneak onto campus for footage, the majority of this film about three students at Harvard in the 1960s was shot at Bridgewater State College in Bridgewater, Mass.
The Bostonians (1984) – As an adaptation of the Henry James short story, this film, a period piece, used exterior shots of Memorial Hall, as well as other Victorian-looking places in Boston.
Soul Man (1986) – The story of a wealthy California kid who, after his father cuts him off, pretends to be black in order to receive an Harvard Law School scholarship reserved for African-Americans, "Soul Man" has few bits of actual footage beside the requisite panorama shots of Harvard Square.
The Firm (1993) – Tom Cruise’s character is about to graduate from Harvard Law School, but the University passed on allowing this Sydney Pollack film to be filmed on campus.
Harvard Man (2001) – Although this movie’s about the point guard on the Harvard basketball team getting mixed up with organized crime through his girlfriend (Sarah Michelle Gellar!), there’s also little actual footage of campus aside from street shots in the square.
Legally Blonde (2001) – Although Elle Woods won a place at Harvard Law School, the camera crews for this blockbuster film did not. A majority of the campus scenes were shot at the University of Southern California, where fall foliage was imported to simulate the New England feel.
The Great Debaters (2007) – The culminating debate in this film actually does take place in Sanders Theatre. This does not violate the policy, according to Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin, who told The Boston Globe that the theater is normally rented out as a concert hall and used for presentations.

Economics professor Gregory Mankiw has written yet another textbook on intermediate macroeconomics, titled Macroeconomics and the Financial System. Slightly different from his previous macroeconomics book, the new textbook boasts more coverage of the financial system in addition to standard macroeconomic theory and application, according to the publisher’s website.
Mankiw is no stranger to coming out with new textbooks. Only last year, to the chagrin of many, he published the 5th edition of his widely popular textbook, Principles of Economics, for Ec 10 and countless other introductory economics courses across the globe.
Not content with dominating introductory economics textbook sales, Mr. Mankiw teamed up with John Hopkins University Professor of Economics Laurence Ball to reinforce his hold on the intermediate macroeconomics textbook market.
Mr. Mankiw’s newest textbook is currently on the press and will hit shelves just in time for the spring semester. So to all of you future Ec1010b students, good luck finding a used copy.
