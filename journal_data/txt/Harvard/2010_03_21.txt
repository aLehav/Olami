After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s tennis (7-6) traveled to California for spring break competition, hoping to emerge with a winning record on the season in back-to-back matches against No. 9 California (9-3) on Wednesday and St. Mary’s (8-5) on Thursday.
At first, the cross-country trip only brought a case of west coast blues for the Crimson, as the Golden Bears blanked Harvard. But the Crimson would go on to redeem itself in a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Gaels the following day.
CALIFORNIA 7, HARVARD 0
Cal handily swept Harvard, 7-0, on Wednesday at the Hellman Tennis Complex. The Golden Bears swept both singles and doubles in a strong showing. In the No. 1 matchup, sophomore Holly Cao and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans fell to Cal’s sixth-ranked duo of Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova 8-4. The Golden Bears secured the doubles point in the second match, with an 8-2 victory over the freshman pair of Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana. In the final doubles matchup, sophomore Caroline Davis and freshman Alexandra Lehman lost 8-4 to Stephany Chang and Annie Goransson.
Holding off Cal was a challenge from the get-go for Harvard, as the home team boasted some of the nation’s top-ranking players. Holding the No. 16 rank in the second singles spot with a 10-2 record, the Golden Bears’ Marina Cossou was no easy opponent for Tachibana, who dropped the match 6-3, 6-0.
Jana Juricova, who took the court against the Crimson’s No. 54 Holly Cao, is the No. 2 singles player in the country, possessing a 9-3 overall record in the first singles slot.
“I was really looking forward to see how I would fare against one of the top singles players in the country,” Cao said.
And the sophomore certainly held up her end of the bargain. Cao took the first set, 6-4, and battled in a second-set loss, 6-3, setting up a super tiebreaker. Juricova pulled away for a 10-4 win, but Cao proved that she belongs on the national stage.
“It was a tense match, and it was encouraging for me to see that I can match up with any player in the country,” Cao said. “Obviously, I was disappointed that I was unable to pull out the deciding tiebreak, but I think I played a good match overall.”
HARVARD 4, ST. MARY’S 3
Harvard’s matchup against St. Mary’s was far less decisive. The Crimson notched a close 4-3 win over the Gaels, drowning out memories of the previous day’s loss.
“We came out with a new mindset,” Rosekrans said. “A new day meant a clean slate. We knew it would be a huge deal if we won because they’re only a few spots behind us in the rankings. [The win] came at a crucial point in the season. It really boosted our morale.”
But early on Harvard quickly found itself trailing 3-0 in the match, with the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles pairs losing 8-2 and 8-4, respectively. The duo of Cao and Rosekrans picked up the sole doubles win for the Crimson in the No. 1 spot.
In addition to surrendering the doubles point, Harvard fell in the No. 2 singles position, 6-4, 6-2, and in the No. 5 position, 6-2, 6-1.
Norton’s resolute 6-3, 6-2 win at No. 3 singles gave the Crimson a reason to hope. With a victory from Cao as well, Harvard could only earn the overall win against St. Mary’s if both Rosekrans at No. 4 singles and Lehman at No. 6 prevailed.
As both players dropped their first sets to the Gaels, winning became a formidable challenge, but hardly one that Rosekrans and Lehman were incapable of conquering.
After losing the first set 6-1, Rosekrans came back to win, 6-2, in the second and went on to hold off her opponent, 7-6. Lehman also narrowly shut down the opposition, 2-6, 7-6, 6-4.
“With tensions high and nerves fraying, Sam and Alex remained tough and were able to pull out the final two points,” Cao said. “Both played steady, calm tennis and demonstrated amazing resolve and determination in closing out the match.”
After witnessing these strong performances, as well as the efforts of Cao, Norton, Tachibana, and freshman Sophie Chang—all of whom are ranked among the top 15 players in the Northeast—Harvard looks to repeat as Ivy League champions this spring season. The players acknowledge that this goal will not materialize without hard work.
“It’s extremely important that we consistently secure the doubles point,” Rosekrans said. “We haven’t mastered that this season, and it was one of our strengths in previous years. We start the Ivy season earlier than the other schools, so in that sense we should have an advantage. Last year, we were Ivy League co-champions [with Princeton]. This time around, we’re hoping to win the title outright.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While spring break for most Harvard students means a respite from all the rigors of campus life here in Cambridge, for the Crimson’s co-ed and women’s sailing teams, the week-long break only brings additional hours out on the water.
Traveling down to Maryland for Harvard’s annual spring break trip, the co-ed squad competed in its second regatta of the season last weekend, improving on its third place effort from the week before to claim the top spot at the John Jackson Team Race held at Georgetown.
While the ladies were not quite able to match the finish of the co-ed team, the women’s squad still opened up its spring campaign in solid fashion, taking fifth at the 27th Women’s Intersectional at Navy.
“We had a rough first round robin on Saturday,” said junior skipper John Stokes of the co-ed team, “but we were able to pull it together nicely on Sunday and finish strong.”
JOHN JACKSON TEAM RACE
The Crimson co-ed squad traveled to the nation’s capital to begin its spring break and posted its first team victory of 2010.  The host Georgetown Hoyas provided the stiffest competition for Harvard, as the two schools emerged to face each other in the final round of competition.  While both teams sported identical overall records of 13-4 on the weekend, the Crimson claimed the victory thanks to the results of individual races among the eight schools that competed.
“Georgetown, and also Brown, are both good teams,” Stokes said, “so we were fortunate to have success against them and earn the victory.”
Competing at skipper for Harvard throughout the two-day affair were juniors Alan Palmer, Teddy Himler, and Stokes, along with sophomore Brendan Kopp.  Senior Michelle Konstadt, junior Megan Wareham, and freshman Alma Lafler took care of the Crimson’s crewing duties in the Washington Sailing Marin Lagoon, which posed an unexpected additional challenge for some teams.
“The conditions were light throughout the two days,” Stokes said, “but the water we were sailing in had a lot of debris, which was an obstacle for some teams but didn’t seem to bother our boats.  We were able to sail well, and this is definitely a confidence-builder for our week of practice.
27TH WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL
While the co-ed squad had one regatta under its belt coming into this weekend, the Harvard women’s team competed in its first event of the spring season, earning a fifth-place finish at the 27th Women’s Intersectional held at Navy.  The Crimson was able to capture five total race wins on the weekend, along with 14 top-four finishes.
“This was a good finish for us, considering we haven’t had much practice at this point,” sophomore skipper Emily Lambert said.  “We were able to get back in the boats and work on getting our boat handling back.”
Competing in the A division for Harvard, Lambert teamed up with fellow second-year Alexandra Jumper, who took care of the crewing duties.  The pair tied for sixth in the division, winning two of its 17 races over the two days of competition.
“The first day had horrible conditions, with pouring rain,” Lambert said, “but it was better the second day with light wind and sunny weather.”
The B-division duo of senior skipper Liz Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel outdid their A-division counterparts, as the pair took home a fourth place division finish, claiming three victories amongst the 17-school field.
“A few of the teams from our New England section weren’t there,” Lambert said, “but we were able to race some teams from the Mid-Atlantic and further south, so that was a good learning experience heading into our week of practice.”
