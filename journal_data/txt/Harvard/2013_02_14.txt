After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a time when Alzheimer’s was considered a genetic disease, one that mainly affected families with a history of Alzheimer’s and only rarely appeared outside this genetic chain. If someone was diagnosed, his family was forced to accept the unfortunate fate as a happenstance outside of their control, similar to that of unexpected cancers or severe, traumatic accidents. However, like many other diseases rampant in today’s society, Alzheimer’s has recently been linked to the unhealthy American diet and fallen into the obesity bandwagon, labeled type 3 diabetes by Brown University neuropathologist Suzanne De La Monte. Her research indicates the main cause of Alzheimer’s is the brain’s inability to use insulin properly for normal brain activity; hence, the diabetes label. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes share an analogous inability. The negative effect high sugar foods have on our physical existence is well understood, but according to this research, these same foods could even affect our future cognitive functionality.
Though the research is clearly compelling, it leaves us with more questions than solutions. Several government policies have already surfaced to mitigate high sugar consumption, only to be immediately criticized with public disapproval. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s highly debated “soda ban” that mandated restaurants only serve up to a certain size of soft drink was accused of being discriminatory and proto-Big Brother. Similarly, Michelle Obama’s 2010 federal school lunch initiative barred certain foods or rationed others and forced an 850-calorie limit. Like many of its ancestral reforms, there has been more evidence supporting the repeal of these regulations than their continuation.
Laws restricting people’s diets are ineffective because they attempt to solve the obesity epidemic with umbrella solutions. Obesity is a highly individualized issue. It isn’t something that can be solved by forcing people to practice self-restraint, because the disease has many contributing factors. And because these rules challenge one’s autonomy—a right to choose what to eat—people tend to focus on whether they feel their personal rights are being violated and not on whether their health is actually being improved. The laws may provide a necessarily severe first step toward ending obesity, but they fall short in actually providing a sustainable solution.
Consider Michelle Obama’s lunch campaign. One major complaint was that some children were hungry at school because their lunches did not provide enough fuel for the day. The students were sluggish, affecting overall school performance, and their metabolism slowed, leading to further health complications. Many parents also started packing lunches, sending sugary juices and fatty snacks off with their kids, simply because they did not know the health risks associated with these common foods or because they could not afford the more expensive, healthier options. While in theory the school lunch program seemed like an easy solution to force children to eat healthier, it instead complicated the issue.
One way to improve current legislation is to point the finger on who is actually to blame. Bloomberg and Obama punish sources by preventing restaurants and school cafeterias from providing unhealthy foods, but they should focus on people who decide to eat these foods in the first place. Enacting laws that provide more options will encourage people to change their lifestyles and result in life-long dietary changes that could last for generations.
NBC’s Biggest Loser opens its newest season by highlighting the influence adults have on children’s health, featuring children for the first time as “contestants” in hopes of inciting viewers to persuade their own children to stay active. Current health legislation and initiatives do not encourage people to take responsibility for their unhealthy decisions and make personal efforts to change their habits. The law should not restrict unhealthy foods but instead make healthy foods more easily accessible, by providing subsidies for healthier food options or implementing taxes on unhealthy foods, for example. With the current restrictions, people are encouraged to overcompensate in other unhealthy areas that are currently not restricted—the natural human reaction to want what they cannot have. This does nothing to help solve our gluttony problem.
Research, laws, and TV shows that highlight the dangerous effects of unhealthy diets have all played an important role in ending obesity by increasing awareness of what could easily be an ignorable disease. However, using impersonal laws to restrict the foods available to Americans is ineffective and inefficient: People waste time attempting to protest the mandates instead of thinking of better solutions. There might not be a winning solution to the obesity problem yet, but until a cure surfaces, Americans must be mindful of what they eat and realize that getting healthier is at least partly a personal choice. Legislation must then do its part to provide healthier options to those that might not be able to afford them and provide individual solutions to keep people healthy. Until we choose to simply have our cake and not eat it too, there is little hope that any solution could end the obesity epidemic.

Remember Valentine’s Day in second grade? When you stuffed your SpongeBob “I love you squar-ey much” cards into the glittered shoebox of each one of your classmates? You made Valentine’s Day cards out of pink construction paper for your parents, and you gave your very bestest friend an extra special treat outside of school to renew your “best friends 4 life” vows. This may not be true for everyone—especially the guys—but for the most part, this is how I remember elementary school Valentine’s Day playing out. To this day, I fondly recall that Valentine’s Day of yesteryear. As we grow up, however, we find that Valentine’s Day morphs into a slightly different holiday with quite different connotations.
As history buffs may know, Valentine’s Day commemorates the life of a Christian saint named Valentinus, who was martyred in A.D. 296. The holiday didn’t actually have any romantic associations attached to it until a millennium later, when poet Geoffrey Chaucer wrote “Parlement of Foules” to honor the anniversary of King Richard II and Anne of Bohemia. Now, centuries after that, there is much build-up to what has become a “Hallmark holiday”: People in relationships feel pressure to plan something romantic, people in pseudo-relationships wonder if it is too soon or crossing the line to speak to their (in)significant others on the 14th, and people not in relationships watch “Love Actually,” eat chocolate, and paint their nails black (at least from what I’ve gathered).
Despite these tropes, Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be spent with (or fantasizing about) someone in the romantic realm. It can double as a day to think about the underappreciated relationships we have in our lives. We can take the time to cherish the bonds we’ve established with our parents and grandparents, friends who listen to all of our drama again and again, people back home whom we haven’t spoken to in a few years, the middle school teacher that sparked our interest in writing, and even the guitar player we stop to listen to on evenings out in the square.
If you are one of the Harvard students who has found love in a hopeless place, you can rightfully expect a little extra TLC on this specific day. But remember that good can also come from paying the excess love forward to someone who doesn’t receive the same kind of appreciation. While I personally haven’t really celebrated Valentine’s Day since my fifth grade plaid jumper days, I do take the holiday as a reminder that, regardless of the day of the year or the occasion, I should take more opportunities to show my appreciation for all of the valuable relationships in my life.
At times, we can get wrapped up in our own busy schedules, constantly running from meeting to meeting and class to class. Even lunch with good friends may occupy only a predetermined time block, and a phone call can only last as long as it takes to get from the dining hall to the Science Center. In the midst of the chaos of the semester, we sometimes forget that everyone—friends, acquaintances, classmates, and strangers—has a story worth listening to.  If we are too busy to take a little time out of our day to be a part of someone else’s, then we are missing out on much of the richness of life. So while some of us may indulge in the greeting card traditions of Valentine’s Day, we can also reconnect with our childhood version of the holiday. Then, once again, we can have multiple Valentines and multiple ways of telling people how much we care about them.

I never seriously considered what the word “hero” meant until this fall. It was a breezy, cool evening just outside Providence, and I had stopped by a charity function to meet up with a friend who was catering the event. The sun was setting, and in keeping with local tradition, all guests were to stand at attention while a cannon was fired and the American flag was lowered.
Usually, residents or employees carry out this task. But tonight, these duties fell to four seniors from the United States Naval Academy. Shortly before the last rays of sunlight disappeared over the horizon, one of the event’s organizers announced the entrance of these “young heroes,” as he called them. On cue, all four trotted out in mess dress, and as they walked by the crowd, one dinner guest stood up and started clapping. A few more followed suit, and soon everyone was on their feet, whether or not they truly believed the accomplishments of these cadets merited applause.
This moment affected many attendees on a deeply emotional level—a few, overcome by pride and patriotism, were on the verge of tears. But for me, and a silent minority of the crowd, the whole ceremony seemed a bit ridiculous.
As far as I could tell, these students had so far succeeded only at receiving an excellent education. I knew a couple of them personally. Both were good guys, but like anyone they had their flaws. The only thing that made them exceptional was that they were preparing to fight in war, and the mere fact that they were warriors—or at least becoming warriors—was apparently enough to make them “heroes” worthy of universal reverence.
I will concede that when students enroll in a service academy, or when non-academic recruits enlist for that matter, many do so because they are genuinely interested in offering their minds and their bodies to a humane and selfless cause. To thousands of enlistees, and to much of the civilian public, there is no better way to do this than to join the military. The resolve and moral purpose of those that fight out of patriotic conviction is admirable. But let’s not romanticize the moral situation of the soldier; once he puts on the uniform, he divests himself of his ability to act according to his reason and conscience. True, he can choose to spare a life or sacrifice his own. These decisions may still be his. But, for good reason, he cannot question his authorities, nor can he choose which battles to fight or make any decisions of that sort. In many ways, he becomes a pawn, serving the whims of his martial superiors and political leaders. Should his conscience contradict his mission at any point, he is required to ignore this contradiction, lest he be labeled a mutineer or a coward.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with pledging oneself unconditionally to a cause so long as the cause is unconditionally correct. Many hawkish Americans would claim that the actions of our armed forces in the modern era, with only trivial exceptions, have been virtuous—hence the heightened level of hero worship within the neoconservative bloc.
I wish I could be so confident. In Iraq, for instance, I’m not sure the deposition of Hussein was worth the death of 100,000 civilians, especially when he was no longer capable of attacking the Kurds to the north or the Shiites to the south. To cherry-pick a few conflicts from the past several decades, our designs in Vietnam and Guatemala hardly seem heroic in retrospect.
I’m sure a few members of the crowd were equally unsure of the humanitarianism of our foreign engagements, but they were clapping nevertheless. “Intentions matter!” they may say. This argument—that the act of fighting, even in an unjust war, is laudable so long as a soldier is well intentioned—has become commonplace. But its popularity doesn’t make it valid. When there is nothing noble about the ends of fighting, we shouldn’t seek comfort in the dated belief that the act of fighting is noble in and of itself. Yet that’s the argument that we advance every time we clap for a soldier merely for having agreed to take up arms.
Readers may ask: why bother with this whole analysis? Why not let soldiers and their families take comfort in the knowledge that they are regarded as heroes in American society?
One could answer this question in many ways, but the most important reason is that our deification of soldiers makes war more palatable. When we say to ourselves that soldiers do not die in vain, that it is always noble to fight for one’s country, we make the tragedy of wars, past and present, easier to digest. As historian and ex-U.S. Air Force lieutenant William Astore points out in the Los Angeles Times, the overuse of heroic rhetoric among continental powers significantly prolonged World War I, as the act of fighting seemed worthwhile even when the desired end had slipped out of reach.
As I watched that crowd outside Providence cheer and cry for those supposed “heroes” simply because they had agreed to fight, I couldn’t help but fear that our modern fetishizing of the military has a similar effect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday, at a Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris proposed a plan that would completely restructure reading period, the prized week before finals most notable for its high number of both paper deadlines and disrobed freshmen. The proposal would eliminate one of these two hallmarks by moving all final project and paper deadlines back to exam period so that they coincide with the week allotted for final exams. Under the proposal, professors would be required to clearly identify the designated due dates at the beginning of the semester, and students would be able to use reading period in the manner that its name suggests.
Harris’s idea has obvious pros and cons, and students on campus are likely to have conflicting views on the matter. While some will argue that giving students more time to complete assignments can be nothing but a good thing, others can retort that they will be unable to successfully manage their time with the newfound agglomeration of deadlines.
We cannot have any idea which scenario is likely to be true for the most students. And considering that students were not involved in formulating the new proposal, the College likely has a similar paucity of information on the matter.
As such, this presents the unique opportunity for campus-wide reflection and discourse. Student opinion should be sought out in designing any new schedule, and students should think about how they value the final weeks of their term and how they envision that period restructuring in the future. We hope that the administration takes into account student input before making any top-down changes. Any alteration of the finals period schedule will have the ostensible purpose of eliminating stress and relieving anxiety in students. This is a noble goal, but students must be consulted in order for it to have a reasonable chance of succeeding.
Over 50 years ago, we opined on the utility of reading period. We recognize now, as we recognized then, that reading periods have the dangerous potential to function as “cramming orgies.” The fundamental flaw in the implementation of the period remains “unpleasantry in human nature.” We must combat this “unpleasantry” by cogitating about it, as students, as faculty, and as administrators. We must heed the words inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: “Know thyself.” The administration can only make a change in good faith once it understands the processes that will positively affect the most students on campus.
The debate over reading period is just beginning, and it poses several questions, both philosophical and logistical. On the more pragmatic end of the spectrum, it is important to examine the role that Harvard faculty will play in any new regime. For the most part, professors here do an excellent job in being communicative and in providing flexibility to students working on important assignments. It would be tragic if the imposition of a new end-of-term regimen in any way hinders this ethic of student assistance. If the goal of a restructured reading period is to give students more time and flexibility in composing final papers and projects, we would hope that professors honor that goal by releasing final assignments well in advance of the new deadlines. We are all ultimately here to learn; any measure to alter the administrative process must keep that in mind. And any effort that increases the facility of receiving a valuable education will be nothing but propitious for the erudition that lies ahead.

Thinking about watching “Love Actually” because it’s Valentine’s Day? Don’t. Here to save you from Hugh Grant’s estrogen-churning narration and a blond Severus Snape, FM brings you prime celluloid flicks for every Valentine’s Day occasion. For one softhearted cinephile (or two):
To apologize for forgetting to make Valentine’s Day plans…
Try “Inferno,” a 3-D film from 1953 in which a scheming wife conspires with her lover to leave her husband to die in the desert. Once your valentine sees that kind of bat-shit insanity, you’ll seem more helpless than negligent.
To add some sexual oomph to your post-Valentine’s date activities…
The key here is subtlety. Consider “Gilda,” the 1946 noir classic starring Rita Hayworth as the drippy, doe-eyed femme fatale. Her coquettish performance of the song “Put the Blame on Mame” will have your valentine pining over pillow talk for a good striptease. Other good alternatives: “Eyes Wide Shut” (1999), “Breaking the Waves” (1996), and porn.
To seduce that ‘friend valentine’ you’ve actually been harboring romantic feelings for…
Express yourself with less, that is, without words. Check out “City Lights” (1931), where Charlie Chaplin’s splayfooted, potty love-struck, and Dickensesque Little Tramp falls in love with a poor blind girl, but is too ashamed to reveal his loser self to her. If you don’t get kissed in the closing scene, your valentine lacks all emotion and is unfit for your affection.
To forget about the fact that you just got dumped a week before Valentine’s Day…
You’ll jump for “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004) or “Casablanca” (1942) because the subject matter so seemingly foots the bill. In the end, however, they’ll just leave you wallowing in the bitter memories of your broken relationship. Instead, go for “High Fidelity” (2000). There’s no telling how many miserable romantics John Cusack has charmed out of breakup depression from behind the film’s precarious fourth wall. For a different take, try “Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2” (1986).
To make you believe in true love…“Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004)—Hayao Miyazaki’s adroitly and sensitively imagined, animated love story puts every Disney sap-fest to shame. An inversion of “Beauty and the Beast,” the film tells the story of a young woman who is turned into an old witch and falls in love with a miscreant wizard who stomps the land in a massive gear-girdling contraption of a castle. Sounds weird? Yes, but that’s what makes it so convincing. See also: “Wayne’s World” (1992) and “Wayne’s World 2” (1993).
To watch by yourself because you have no valentine…“Labyrinth” (1986)—See David Bowie as Jareth, Goblin King of the Labyrinth. Trust us on this one.

The Brattle Theatre’s dark red awning hangs low on the side of the building that more prominently houses Algiers Coffee House. But this unassuming countenance does little to suggest the small, single-screen movie house’s long influential history. In the 60 years since its opening, the Brattle has helped to transform local film culture, and its influence has extended across the country. Despite ever-increasing competition from multiplex cinemas and the internet, the Brattle, offering everything from recent Hollywood hits to independent foreign documentaries, remains Harvard Square’s only movie theater and one of its most beloved cultural institutions.
Let’s Bring Movies Back
In its early years, founders Cyrus I. Harvey ’47 and Bryant N. Halliday ’49 used the theater to promote slightly obscure and underappreciated films to contemporary audiences. At a time when even big Hollywood releases would, after their initial run, be put into storage and forgotten about, the Brattle pioneered the idea of revival cinema. “It helped to launch this idea of ‘let’s bring movies back.’ It introduced these old films to a whole new generation,” says Marianne Lampke, who ran the theater along with Connie White from 1986 until 2001.
Starting in the mid-’50s, the Brattle began a yearly tradition of holding a Humphrey Bogart film festival right before the Harvard exam period. Undergraduates would flock to the headline screening of “Casablanca” as a welcome respite from studying. “We still hear stories about it now: The sound went out during a screening but everybody just kept saying the lines anyway, people have proposed to each other in the balcony during “Casablanca,” people used to come dressed up. It was the original ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show,’” says Ned Hinkle, the Brattle’s creative director. Harvard’s “Bogie Cult” sparked similar Bogart sensations at other colleges around the nation.
Harvey, who discovered the works of many international directors at the Cinematheque while studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, also wanted to expose American audiences to foreign films. At the Brattle, they screened works of filmmakers from around the world who were relatively obscure in America at the time, though some of their names—Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, and Kurosawa—are widely recognized today. They also founded a distribution company, Janus Films, to distribute foreign films nationwide. “There were a lot of little independent art house theaters in Cambridge at the time, and they all had their little niche. The Brattle’s niche was that they played these great international films,” Hinkle says. Though Janus Films eventually closed when major Hollywood distributors began to take interest in foreign films, foreign films still constitute a large part of the Brattle’s programming.
Vertical Programming
In the mid ’70s, Harvey and Halliday sold the theater, which changed hands multiple times over the next decade. Susan and J.D. Pollack ran the theater in the early ’80s, maintaining the repertory and revival programming philosophy, but jazzing it up with a concession stand and a new balcony. Lampke and White, who both worked at the theater under the Pollacks, took over in 1986. They instituted a strategy they called “vertical programing,” in which they ran a different series each day of the week. “One of the things that we did forever was film noir Mondays. Tuesdays for a while we were doing independent cinema and showing emerging filmmakers. Wednesdays we had a series for a long time called Recent Raves,” said Lampke. “We were trying to keep it rotating so that each night of the week new audiences would come.”
The Recent Raves series continued Harvey and Halliday’s desire to give audiences another chance to see films that had already been retired from first-run theaters. After the Kendall Square Theater opened, however, which kept first-run movies running for longer periods than the Brattle, the market for second-run films at the Brattle declined. Lampke and White also continued their predecessors’ practice of seeking out contemporary foreign films not yet widely screened in the U.S., such as Japanese anime films and Jackie Chan’s Hong Kong action flicks. “Those films were really drawing a student audience,” said Lampke.
An ‘Indefinable Experience’
Hinkle and Ivy Moylan, former employees of Lampke and White, have run the Brattle since 2001. Though movie theater attendance has been dropping everywhere since the mid ’90s, in the past couple of years their attendance numbers have defied the national trend and actually increased by a small percentage.
Hinkle and Moylan are also working towards major technological changes—they’ve started a kickstarter campaign to raise money for a new digital projection and a new air conditioning system. The Brattle used to emphasize the advantage of seeing a movie on film stock, but now, as many major releases are not even released on celluloid, they want an upgrade so as not to limit their programming. “We’ll continue to play old movies and we’ll continue to play movies on film, but we have to be able to play everything,” said Hinkle.
For Hinkle, going to a theater at all is an undervalued experience. “I think there are movies that are being done a disservice by people who only watch them at home because when you see something with a crowd, even if there are only 10 other people in the theater, you have this indefinable experience where your reaction is bouncing off of other people’s and vice versa,” said Hinkle. “A funny movie is funnier, a scary movie is scarier.”

Hey there, lovebirds! It’s Valentine’s Day, and you know what that means: Dozens of you will be having happy, romantic evenings around the Square tonight, while the rest of us will be stuck with whatever questionable casserole HUDS feels like serving. But it doesn’t have to be that way! FM is here to find you a restaurant that’s singles friendly.
 First Printer
This classy spot is definitely a no-go except for the bar area. You’ll see plenty of young couples who, waiting for their entrées to be cooked up, leaning across elegant wooden tables to stare into each other’s vacant faces, all the while sipping on their $10 cocktails. The place won’t take a reservation for one tonight, so don’t bother showing up without a fun little romance. The bar section gets pleasantly noisy, drowning out what I’m sure are completely inane conversations taking place throughout the restaurant’s candlelit corners. The drinks are also comfortingly strong, so drink away if the sight of their clasped hands starts making you so nauseous you stop wanting the bison burger you ordered.
 L.A. Burdick Chocolates
Ah, Burdick’s. A longtime staple for students’ first dates, the chocolatier is sure to be buzzing with lovey-dovey couples all day. The cold doesn’t help either, since their hot chocolate is some of the best in the Square. Bring an iPod—the wait will be a long one, and unless you have someone to talk to in line, you’re sure to be driven mad by the idea that even the unshaved, food-stained-shirt-wearing, smelly guy behind you could have a date scheduled for tonight at the nearest Chick-fil-A. If there’s only one of something left, be sure to buy it for yourself. We wouldn’t want one of those cute couples to break up arguing over who gets the last one, now, would we?
 Basta Pasta
A winner! Nobody at Harvard ever leaves the Square, so it’ll be mostly date-free this Valentine’s Day. Finally, you can enjoy your hearty meal without having to endure another clichéd marriage proposal and distracting applause interrupting your meal. Seriously, do those people have any idea how obnoxious it is to have their special moment absorb the attention of everyone in the restaurant, including my waiter’s? He can’t even see me trying to order another bottle of wine for myself.

I spent the summer before my senior year of high school walking  past the same painting every day. A woman in a white dress sits holding a  fan, ankles crossed primly. The brim of a modish hat obscures her face,  but her dark-eyed profile is reflected in the mirror behind her. That  summer, she hung, gilt framed, in the window of a Manhattan gallery just  down the block from my internship at The Frick Collection. Every time I  rounded the corner of East 70th Street onto Madison, the woman in the  white dress stared obliquely out at me, but I never paused much to look  at her. There was always the M4 bus to catch or friends waiting for me,  and the painting never changed.
The last day of my internship, my mom came to the  museum to see my final presentation. After it was over, we walked  together to the bus stop. “Up here on the right is Knoedler’s,” I said.  “Knoedler was the art dealer who—“
It was at this point that my mom looked past  Knoedler’s, to the gallery next door, and seized my arm. “Oh my God!  That painting is by your great-great-uncle!” She was pointing to the  woman in white.
This idea was too absurd to contemplate. I knew that  my great-great-uncle had been a painter, just like his brother, my  great-grandfather. All of this was the stuff of my childhood bedtime  stories. Molarsky paintings had always lined the walls of our apartment  and filled the cupboards in the study above the space my crib once  occupied. But these paintings were private mementos of our family  history, not public art objects, and so I laughed and told my mother she  must be wrong.
But she was right.
A woman  working in the gallery told us that the painting was, indeed, a  Molarsky, and that it could be ours for the price of three years of  college tuition, sans financial aid. We didn’t—couldn’t—buy the  painting, but we stood for a long time staring at it through the window  glass.
My great-great-uncle, the painter of the woman in  the white dress, came from Kiev, Ukraine to Philadelphia in 1892—or  1887, depending on which documents you trust. As a young artist studying  in Paris, he would later change his name to Maurice, but he was born  Morris Molarsky, and that was still his name when he arrived in America  as a boy of fourteen. According to family lore, Morris, his parents, and  his older brother—Abe, my great-grandfather—came fleeing the pogroms,  but no one (at least, no one living) is quite sure.
Of the two brothers, it is Abe who fascinates me. We  know that in America, Abe studied violin, while his brother studied  painting. When Morris won an art scholarship to Paris and became  Maurice, Abe tagged along. They shared a studio in the Latin Quarter, on  the Rue de Vaugirard, where I imagine they painted all day and all  night, illuminated by flickering lamplight, shivering against the cold,  their hands swaddled in wool gloves, like characters from La Bohème.
When the scholarship money was all used up, Abe kept  painting in New Jersey and made a meager living teaching art classes.  He never had any patience for his students. “See color,” he would tell  them again and again, and become infuriated when their work did not  improve. Not even the most dedicated pupil could learn to see color the  way Abe could instinctively. Maurice was the celebrated academician of  the two brothers, and his technical polish earned him a steady stream of  portrait commissions from bourgeois Philadelphians. It was Abe, though,  with his dearth of formal training, who could render with intense  feeling a wooded landscape or scene of harbored boats in a few rapid  movements of the brush.
Abe never achieved fame or fortune as an artist, but  he didn’t stopped painting. Maybe he didn’t know how to stop. Painting  was his vocation in the original, weighty, Christian sense of the  word—he was called to pick up the brush as some are called to preach.  His only career advice for his children was, “Take up writer. Take up  musician. Take up hot dog stand—don’t take up painter!”
Now, as a sophomore and newly-declared History of  Art and Architecture concentrator, I find myself wondering what it would  be like to “take up painter”—to devote myself to some path  unthinkingly, because something in my very nature compels me to, as Abe  once did with painting. I do love art history, but I chose my  concentration after making pro/con lists and doing online research.  There are internships, graduate degrees, and (hopefully) entry-level  jobs in my future. What would it be like to paint all night long in a  drafty garrett like Abe, less by choice than out of some unavoidable  need?
As a child, I used to kneel on the living room sofa  in order to put myself at eye level with the enormous Abe canvas hanging  there. From inches away, the rippling water of a New Jersey creek  dissolved into great, thick gobs of yellow and green paint. When no one  was looking, I would reach up and trace the edges of each brushstroke,  raised a few millimeters off the surface of the canvas. It was a  reverent act of devotion, although one I knew my mother would chide me  for. I felt that with each touch of fingertips to hardened pigment I  could understand my great-grandfather just a little more—feel what he  had felt, do as he had done.
Marina Molarsky-Beck ‘15, an FM executive, is a History of Art and  Architecture Concentrator in Eliot House. She (probably) won’t take up  hot dog stand.

I have always wanted a  secret admirer. In high school my friend Millie had one. As we were  assembling our woodwind instruments at the start of band class, she told  me that someone had left a single red rose taped to her locker with no  note or expectation behind it. Only much later did we discover that the  rose had come from George, a slender, graceful senior who had been  Millie’s number one match on our Valentine’s Day data match survey.  Though the survey had polled for deodorant preferences and favorite  YouTube sensations, Millie was giddy that she had been matched with such  a sweet senior boy. Being admired, or at the very least celebrated,  meant something.
On a  chilly February night of freshman year, I convinced my friend to  accompany me to the mail center after Annenberg brain break. I needed to  pick up a card that Grandma had sent—she sends her valentines two weeks  early lest the trusty postal system encounter a delay. Steeped in  conversation with my friend, I turned the lock on what I thought was my  mailbox, 1416, but was actually its neighbor, 1415. It opened easily. I  guess people forget that a few extra swivels are necessary to fully lock  a mailbox.   
Before long,  my friend and I were skipping down the corridor, flinging our hands at  the metallic knobs and twisting open any door that could be unlatched.  After rendering mailbox locks meaningless, we leaned against the back  wall and stared out at the plane of mailboxes, most flat and sealed but  many jutting out into the third dimension with their open  doors—illuminated windows amidst a sleeping skyscraper.  
As my friend  and I admired our work, I realized that this would be my first  Valentine’s Day without a boyfriend in three years. This year the  store-bought card from Grandma could be my one, my only, valentine. But  it didn’t have to be this way. I could leave behind a note in one of  these open mailboxes. I could become someone’s secret admirer.   
I chose one  of the open mailboxes at random: let’s call it number 1039. “To 1039,” I  scratched with a blunt pencil on a square of lined paper I tore out of  my Expos notebook. Then I composed a poem. The exact verses elude me  now, but the poem was an ode—something about a smile that shines with  the shimmer of 1,000 suns, teeth nested and glowing like newly polished  pearls.  At the end I noted that if the admired wanted to respond,  slipping a note under the stack of IM newsletters sitting by the mail  counter would do the trick. I never expected a note in return.   
The next  time I visited the mail center I checked under the IM newsletters on a  whim and, to my surprise, encountered a response from my admired 1039.  Like me, 1039 wrote in pencil, but my admired’s instrument was of  thinner, more confident lines. 1039 wrote the note on folded printer  paper, one notch up in elegance from my college-ruled first attempt.  This clean white paper signaled to me that the note may have been  composed in the dorm or near a computer lab—it was intentionally and  carefully written, quite unlike the ripped-off notebook jots of my first  correspondence. Reveling in the purity of my skin, the sparkle of my  eyes, 1039’s note had a singsong yet mystical quality. It left no clues  as to the identity of my admired.    
Walking  around campus in the following days I daydreamed about my admired,  constantly imagining who this person could be. In Annenberg every person  was a possible admired: the swimmer with strapping shoulders, the  nimble-fingered violinist, the soft, contemplative face behind  Descartes’ Meditations. I came to admire them all. Their gazes were  glitter, their dispositions sacred.   
Valentine’s  Day was fast approaching, and I wanted to do something special for my  admired 1039. One Friday night I congregated with some friends in the  Adams Arts Space, a rickety room off Adams courtyard full of old  clothing, forgotten books, and an impressive collection of paints. While  others socialized I devoted myself to a valentine, slicing out glossy  photos of haloed angels from an old medieval art textbook and lining the  prints with a crinkled satin ribbon. Backing the images on red  cardstock, I penned another declaration of admiration to 1039 in silver  Sharpie.  
 Valentine  complete, I decided that rather than leaving the valentine in mailbox  1039 I would send my admirer on a scavenger hunt. On a yellowed page  from an old German joke book scattered amidst the Adams art debris, I  scrawled a rudimentary map of Annenberg, marking very clearly where 1039  could find the valentine. It would be waiting beneath coordinates  1,1—on the underside of the first table, in the first row and column of  Annenberg Hall. When Valentine’s Day arrived I opened mailbox 1039 from  the outside and stuffed in the map, then hurried off to Annenberg to  tape my haloed angel card beneath the chosen table.   
Someone  found the hidden card—I checked underneath table 1,1 in Annenberg a few  days later and it had disappeared. Maybe it was picked up by my admired,  maybe by another. Either way, I never heard back. But I don’t mind.  Getting to love someone, to prioritize another, even in secret, made it  worth it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a small discussion group that included Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and consisted primarily of undergraduates, government and African American studies professor Jennifer L. Hochschild argued that racial attitudes change significantly decade to decade, but that these shifts often go unnoticed.
The event, which took place in the Widener Library rotunda on Wednesday as part of the Faculty Book Talk Series with Dean Evelynn Hammonds, centered around Hochschild’s book “Creating a New Racial Order: How Immigration, Multiracialism, Genomics, and the Young Can Remake Race in America.”
Hochschild said that the book brings a statistical perspective to shifts in racial hierarchy over time in the United States, tracking the changing positions and opinions on race of different groups. She also said that genomics of race are discussed in the work, but to a lesser degree.
During the discussion, Hochschild argued that the studies presented in the book demonstrate that racial relations have evolved, even though laws pertaining to race relations have remained relatively unchanged since the end of segregation.
Hochschild said that these constantly evolving racial relations impacted her own writing process.
“The world changed an enormous amount in the decade it took to write this,” she said.
Hochschild also described the addition or expansion of recognized racial groups that she found in her research. She said that while America’s racial spectrum used to be defined by “a few exhaustive groups,” social divisions are blurred now more than ever in U.S. history.
With regard to a public shift in racial opinions and identities, Hothschild said that “there has been a huge reversal.”
Since 1958, the number of Americans that approve of interracial marriage has jumped from four to over 80 percent. She pointed to the election of President Obama as a symbol of changing cultural conceptions of racial identity.
Hochschild said that in a survey of 4000 college students asking about race or ethnic identity and family descent, 3200 different answers were received. She said that one of the most notable and telling responses included “Latino in some situations,” an answer which she said reflects the fact that racial identity has become a less fixed identifier.
Two more discussions in the Faculty Book Talk Series with Dean Evelynn Hammonds remain, one on March 5 and one on April 10, both of which will take place in the Widener Library rotunda.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From applicants living in Asia to military personnel who are on active duty, qualified prospective students for Harvard Law School were interviewed through the free videoconferencing software Skype for the first time.
“The technology is working even better than we had hoped,” said Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer and former Crimson business editor Jessica L. Soban ’02. “We’ve gotten great feedback from those that we’ve interviewed which has been really encouraging for us.”
Along with Soban, Harvard Law School Director of Admissions Karen E. Buttenbaum is also conducting interviews, which have occurred on a rolling basis since November.
“We have found it a really valuable part of our process,” Soban said. “Phone’s hard. You don’t get to see me nod, and I don’t get to see the other person smile. That’s the kind of stuff that makes for a really human interaction, and I think that it was missing from the phone interview.”
Soban said that the Law School aims to invite 1,200 students to interview in the new format by the end of this year’s admissions cycle, compared to 1,000 candidates who were interviewed via phone last year.
If a candidate is unable to interview via Skype, the Law School admissions office is prepared to offer special accommodations, which so far have not been needed.
Already one of only a small number of law schools to conduct interviews, Harvard joins a select few to offer videoconferencing, Soban said.
Second year Law School student Claire M. Guehenno ’09, a former Crimson news editor, said she appreciated having an interview for Harvard. “Especially for such a big school, it makes you much more connected to the admissions process,” she said.
Soban admitted that interviewing via Skype has its imperfections.
“The more you do it, the more it starts to feel like a really personal interaction, but it can be awkward when you’re first getting to know how to use the technology,” she said.
Third year Law School student Benjamin Schultz said that videoconferencing was not common enough to ensure that candidates felt comfortable in that setting.
“People have a certain idea of how to conduct themselves in a phone interview, but Skype is not widespread enough to have the same effect,” he said.
Guehenno said that she had mixed feelings about the use of Skype as an interview medium.
“In some ways it’s more awkward [than a phone interview] since you have to worry about how you look and where you are sitting,” she said. “But there are some advantages to Skype because it makes it more personal. It more accurately depicts what an interview process is like in real life.”
Soban said that she anticipates that the practice of conducting interviews through Skype will continue at the Law School for at least the next several years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The humanities reigned in the latest round of concentration satisfaction ratings, followed closely by the social sciences and life sciences. As was the case in previous years, smaller concentrations generally outperformed larger ones in the survey, which is taken every spring by graduating seniors.
Women, Gender, and Sexuality achieved the highest satisfaction rate among members of the Class of 2012 with a 4.78 out of 5. Only nine graduating seniors last year concentrated in WGS.
“Our students receive a lot of one-on-one attention,” said director of undergraduate studies in WGS Caroline Light.
Government and Economics, which boast two of the largest pools of concentrators in the College, placed in the bottom five in the most recent ratings.
The results did not surprise the government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch, who said that satisfaction is usually inversely correlated with the size of the department.
“That doesn’t mean that a big department can’t do better,” Welch said.
The government department is in the process of implementing changes in the advising system that were approved last year, but it has been too soon, Welch said, to see their impact reflected on the satisfaction survey.
But according to Jeffrey Miron, director of undergraduate studies for the economics department, concentration size may not be the only factor behind the student satisfaction.
“I think some majors tend to get students because the students love those disciplines, and other majors get students because it’s a useful thing to do, and it’s probably going to be useful in terms of getting a job,” Miron said.
MOVERS AND SHAKERS
In last year’s survey, several humanities concentrations experienced jumps in ratings, while the average score of life science concentrations has decreased.
History and Literature and English—the two largest humanities departments—both scored above a 4.1 out of 5 in the concentration satisfaction surveys.
History and Literature has seen a steady upward trend in the past 3 years, which Jon W. Oakes ’13 credits to small class and tutorial sizes. Other humanities departments, including Literature, Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Architecture, and Comparative Study of Religion, all scored at least a 4.2.
East Asian Studies saw the greatest increase in ratings—from 4.18 to 4.58. The department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Michael Szonyi attributes the jump to recent efforts to develop a sense of community within the department.
On the other hand, life sciences’ average satisfaction score has decreased steadily from 4.31 in 2010 to 4.14 this past year. Faculty and concentration advisers in the life sciences said they hope to maintain and improve the experiences of their concentrators, while noting their jump in ratings relative to their scores from a decade earlier. Between 2009 and 2010, the mean rating shot up from 3.52 to 4.14 after the splintering of the life sciences into what are now nine specialized concentrations.
“It’s nice that there’s a cluster [of concentrations] because it gives a lot of flexibility between the life sciences, and students can really find out where their interests lie,” said Tamara J. Brenner, associate director of life sciences education.
To facilitate student research, the life sciences employ a personalized advising system, with Ph.D.-holding faculty whose full-time job consists of offering guidance to concentrators.
“Having small concentrations with a designated adviser for each student helps a lot,” said William J. Anderson, associate director of education in the life sciences.
This year, the Department of Music score dropped .8 points from the year before to score a 3.36—the lowest in the 2012 survey.
But Mary Gerbi, undergraduate coordinator for the department, said that numbers can be misleading for many of the smaller departments.
“Because the graduating senior class is so small, the sample size changes a lot from year to year,” said Gerbi, who added that the department is starting a review committee to address concentration satisfaction.

In a town hall meeting entitled “All About the X,” dozens of faculty members from across Harvard’s schools gathered to learn more about ongoing online course development and research at HarvardX, the subset of EdX courses and technologies taught and developed by Harvard faculty.
“I wanted to make it clear to faculty about how much of an opportunity this is to think creatively about their whole process of teaching and learning,” said Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX. “How often do you see folks convening together around an idea from FAS, the Kennedy School, the Design School, the Medical School, and the School of Public Health?”
At the meeting, members of the HarvardX team presented a how-to guide for creating EdX modules. For example, Marlon Kuzmick, associate director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, showed professors how to integrate video into their modules.
Currently, lecture capture studios allow professors to simulate the classroom experience when recording lessons. According to Kuzmick, devices that project images of a person’s face over a teleprompter can facilitate more personable performances from faculty when they speak to the camera.
Katie L. Vale, FAS Director of Academic Technology, summarized the infrastructure of the EdX platform and showed how a student would experience a newly-created module.
Following Vale, Andrew D. Ho, chair of the HarvardX Research Committee, presented the ways in which the committee can help professors evaluate analytics from the online course platform.
Finally, lecturer David J. Malan ’99 spoke about his first few months as an instructor of CS50x: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” for which over 140,000 students registered.
“One of the greatest takeaways of participating in EdX was the imperative mandate to take the course to the next level, doing the initiatives we had envisioned technologically and pedagogically, and then applying them back to the on-campus students,” Malan said.
In the final open discussion, faculty asked specific questions regarding assessment for humanities courses, the incorporation of hands-on learning in online classes, and HarvardX’s cost and revenue models.
In the end, the HarvardX team encouraged interested professors to utilize the infrastructure already in place and to submit course ideas to be voted on by the HarvardX Faculty Committee.
“We want to engage more faculty, more broadly. This is not a situation where we’ll say, ‘Oh, now we’re full, we should stop now,’” Lue said. “We’re definitely building capacity.”

Cambridge frozen yogurt lovers can rejoice at the impending arrival of Yogurtland, a self-service yogurt store featuring 16 flavors and more than 40 toppings, to Harvard Square in mid-April. The yogurt purveyor will be housed at the former location of Faron Salon at 57 JFK St.
According to Larry Sidoti, vice president of development, the store plans to have a grand opening in late April.
Though Yogurtland has opened locations in 21 states since its 2006 launch, the California-based company is just beginning to spread to the East Coast. Huntley Castner, executive vice president of Yogurtland franchising, said the company is focusing its efforts on Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.
“We looked at all three of those cities and decided what would be the absolute best places that we could be in those cities. Not a surprise, Harvard Square was one of those locations,” Castner said.
Unlike some of the other Yogurtland stores, which operate as independent franchises, the new Cambridge location will be owned directly by the Yogurtland corporation.
“We believe so much in the Harvard Square location that we wanted to own the store ourselves, and we are really excited about it,” Castner said.
The store will be open from 11 a.m. to midnight every day and will include  about 16 to 20 indoor seats and limited outdoor seating.
Vanessa C. Rodriguez ’16, a Florida native familiar with the Yogurtland brand, expressed excitement at the announced arrival.
“From what I’ve experienced, compared to other yogurt places, it’s a lot cheaper,” Rodriguez said. “They have a lot of flavors that are constantly changing, and it’s based off the way people rank them and what sells out the most, so they really care about the customers.”
Castner said that he expects that the continuous introduction of new flavors will attract many in the Harvard Square community.
According to Castner, a “Willy Wonka type” innovation team works year-round inventing flavors and “spending months and months of passion and efforts trying to get it right.”
Sidoti added that Yogurtland’s size—over 200 stores—allows it to offer high quality yogurt at a lower price per ounce than at most other stores.
“I’ve visited most of our competitors, and there’s a real difference,” he said. “[Students] are in for a real treat.”
While the new Yogurtland will open near fellow frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry, Castner said that the distinct experiences offered by the two stores—Yogurtland is self-serve and Pinkberry is full-service—will enable the stores to “live side by side.”
“In the end, the customer decides whether they love us,” Castner said.
“We’re going to do everything we can to help you guys love us.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 14, 2013

As Harvard embraces digital learning with the launch of online education platform EdX, professors in traditional Harvard classrooms are asking undergraduates to keep off of laptops and on task during class, hoping to eliminate the temptation to surf the Internet.
“I didn’t used to [ban laptops], but it just became clearer and clearer that it was sort of an open secret that everybody used their laptops and the Internet in ways we all know they do in class,” said Samuel Zipp, a visiting professor of history from Brown University. Zipp does not allow laptops in his course History 1450: “The United States Metropolis, 1945-2000.”
There is no College policy on the use of laptops in class, according to Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Instead, individual faculty members make their own policies.
But Alison Simmons, a professor of philosophy, said that more professors are discussing how to address the rise of laptop use in class.
“We’re all talking about it,” said Simmons. “You can’t go to a faculty meeting or a dinner party where it doesn’t come up.”
Simmons does not allow laptop use in lecture with exceptions for approved reasons, a policy she wrote last year. Though she acknowledges that there are benefits to having a laptop in class—the ability to look at texts that are available online, for example—Simmons said she instituted the laptop ban because they can be distracting, both because of the temptation to surf the Internet and from the sounds of other students typing.
Taking notes on a laptop might also cause students to focus on taking everything down instead of synthesizing concepts, she said.
“It’s not simple or straightforward, but at the moment, I think the arguments in favor of disallowing them outweigh [allowing them],” Simmons said.
Zipp said laptops can disrupt the connection between student and professor.
“I’m interested in creating a reciprocal relationship [with students], and sometimes that’s hard in a lecture as it stands,” Zipp said. “I think that the Internet makes it harder.”
Both Simmons and Zipp wondered what the impact would be on the classroom if instructors could turn off Internet access in their lectures so that students could take notes on their laptops without online distractions.
Some students think there is value in taking notes on laptops, despite the risk of distraction.
Henry J. Limitone ’16 said laptops should be allowed in lecture classes.
This fall as a student in Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice,” Limitone starting taking notes on his laptop because he discovered he could not write quickly enough. A few weeks later when professor Michael J. Sandel told students they could not use their laptops, Limitone said he felt that it was a disadvantage.
“Inevitably, you’re going to have students who abuse [laptops],” Limitone said. “I don’t think professors should try and put rules in place that aim to make you a better student. We’re 18 years old, 19 years old—we should be able to make the right decision and not abuse the laptop in class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Inn at Harvard slated to become swing housing for Dunster House students during house renewal in 2014, an undetermined number of the Inn’s employees face potential layoffs.
Currently, there are approximately 65 employees working at the Inn at Harvard, which is scheduled to close on July 15.
The Inn at Harvard is operated by Collegiate Hospitality, LLC, a company which also manages the Harvard Square Hotel. Both of those assets are owned by Harvard University, according to Collegiate Hospitality’s website.
“We’re working with the state of Massachusetts and Harvard University to reemploy a number of employees between now and July 15,” said Collegiate Hospitality CEO Richard Carbone.
For those employees that do not get reemployed, Collegiate Hospitality has been working to create severance packages. Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment on whether Harvard was funding the severance packages.
Lisa Hogarty, Harvard vice president for campus service said that Harvard is providing services to help the Inn’s employees in obtaining another job.
“We’ve offered coaching support for employees needing help writing a resume,” Hogarty said. She added that as more jobs become available in the summer, Harvard “will flag those positions for these employees and offer them priority.”
Hogarty said that, ultimately, the house renewal project will create more jobs than it costs.
“We anticipate over the course of a decade we will generate almost 3600 jobs,” Hogarty said, noting that this number includes construction workers, support staff, consultants, designers, and engineers.
Before students move in, the Inn at Harvard will be transformed to include a dining hall, kitchen, and additional study spaces.
After Dunster renewal is completed, Hogarty said the Inn will continue to serve as swing housing for each house as it goes through renovations.
Harvard University Dining Services employees and Harvard Facilities Maintenance Operations staff will move with the students, working at the Inn at Harvard while the House in which they usually work is under construction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days after Harvard announced the results of its massive Government 1310 cheating investigation, lawyers who have consulted with accused students say the door is still open for legal challenges against the University.
Attorneys interviewed for this article acknowledged that litigation would be difficult because of the apparently scrupulous nature of Harvard’s investigation and its status as a private institution. Still, they say, the statute of limitations leaves ample time for specific student grievances to emerge.
Last August, Harvard announced that it was investigating about 125 students for inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in last spring’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” course.
During an investigation which spanned the fall semester, more than half of the accused undergraduates—approximately 70 students—were asked to temporarily withdraw from the College. An additional quarter of investigated students were put on probation.
The University has not publicly indicated whether it has faced any litigation connected with the scandal.
When the scandal broke last fall, lawyers speculated that lawsuits stemming from the scandal would hinge on whether the Administrative Board adhered to its procedures as described in the student handbook.
Now that the investigation is complete, attorneys say that the Ad Board appeared to closely follow its delineated rules throughout the probe, making lawsuits less likely.
In addition, they say, Harvard’s status as a private institution makes it difficult for students to sue the University after a disciplinary proceeding.
Michael R. Schneider, a Boston lawyer who has consulted with several undergraduates accused in the scandal, said that disciplined students face an uphill battle when they bring civil cases against private universities.
“In general, there are very few of these cases that make it into the court system,” Schneider said. “The only meaningful vehicle that usually survives in court is a claim of breach of contract.”
In this scenario, he said, a student would have to demonstrate that the University had committed “a very specific breach of a particular provision that had a damaging, negative impact on the final result.”
In Massachusetts, such cases require a heavy burden of proof on the part of the student, according to Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge lawyer who has advised Harvard students facing Ad Board investigations since the late 1960s.
Silverglate said that Schaer vs. Brandeis University, a case heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 2000, sets a high bar for students who want to sue private universities. In the case, a student sued Brandeis for failing to adhere to its official procedures in a sexual assault investigation. The court ruled in favor of Brandeis, a private institution, on the grounds that universities are “not required to adhere to the standards of due process” used in criminal or civil courts.
“Schaer vs. Brandeis makes Harvard very close to invulnerable,” Silverglate said.
Despite these hurdles to student litigation, lawyers emphasized that lawsuits may still have enough heft and time to come to light.
For one, if a student did decide to sue Harvard for breach of contract, his or her case might center around the course’s allegedly unclear collaboration policies, Schneider said.
Although the final exam instructions stated that “students may not discuss the exam with others,” students in the course have claimed that teaching fellows encouraged collaboration.
In addition, if any students have grievances about specific violations of Ad Board procedures in their case, they may not come forward immediately, Schneider suggested.
“A lot of students and lot of parents are reluctant to file a lawsuit until the student is out of the institution,” Schneider said, citing student fears of retaliation from administrators.
He pointed out, however, that disciplined students, including those who were required to temporarily withdraw from the College, will still be able to file lawsuits after they graduate. In Massachusetts, the statute of limitations stipulates that breach of contract lawsuits can be filed up to six years after the alleged violation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at the Harvard Kennedy School became Harvard’s second student body to vote yes on a referendum question supporting responsible investment of the University’s endowment.
In a student election held on Monday and Tuesday, 93 percent of Kennedy School voters approved the referendum question, which calls for the University to seed its planned social choice fund with .1 percent—roughly $30 million—of its $30.7 billion endowment.
Nearly half of the Kennedy School’s approximately 1,000 students cast ballots in the election.
Kennedy School student David J. Garfunkel—a member of the Responsible Investment @ HKS leadership team, which coordinated the referendum question—said he and other organizers are “really thrilled about the turnout.”
Although the ballot question drew overwhelming student support, it is unclear what, if any, effect the referendum will have on University policy. The University has not indicated whether it will draw any funds from its existing endowment to jumpstart the new fund, which will be launched on July 1.
This past November, the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition—the parent organization of Responsible Investment @ HKS—coordinated a similar student referendum at the College. In that election, 80.5 percent of undergraduate voters cast ballots in support of the establishment of a social choice endowment fund.
Prior to the Kennedy School’s referendum vote, organizers said that school-wide support of the measure would be a talking point in further discussion with administrators.
“We hope to communicate the results to the administration and to make it known that this is an issue that goes beyond just College students, but also grad students,” Kennedy School student Alexander “Alexi” White, a member of the Responsible Investment at Harvard leadership team, said last week.
Responsible Investment @ HKS plans to motivate fellow Harvard Harvard graduate schools to partake in a social choice coalition.
“As our movement grows in strength, we kind of want to add to the unified voice of Harvard students,” Garfunkel said.
Garfunkel said that the social choice fund presents the University with an opportunity of historic magnitude.
“Harvard is a worldwide leader when it comes to so many other issues. There’s no reason to think that responsible investment needs to be any different,” Garfunkel said. “We really want to encourage the administration to capitalize on the first step that they’ve taken and to really take the lead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 20, 2013, at 10:35 a.m.
A Harvard researcher has found that typically African-American names are more likely to be linked to a criminal record in Google-generated advertisements on the online search engine and on the news site Reuters.com, a website to which Google supplies advertisements.
Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard, began her research after a colleague, government department fellow Adam Tanner, told her that his Google search of her name had generated an advertisement that read: “Latanya Sweeney: arrested.”
In disbelief, Sweeney began poking around online and found that advertisements from criminal records site InstantCheckmate.com incorrectly suggested that she had an arrest history. The two then plugged Tanner’s name into Google and, to the pair’s surprise, it generated a neutral InstantCheckmate ad that did not hint at a criminal record.
“Adam jumped to the conclusion that [the advertisements] were coming up on Black-sounding names,” said Sweeney. “I spent hours trying to show him that he was wrong and couldn’t.”
Thus began the start of a research study, which was partially funded by Google, that involved extensive combing of the Internet and numerous databases. Sweeney’s research paper summarizing her findings is slated for publication in an academic journal.
First, Sweeney identified typically African-American names using a database that compiled first names given disproportionately to babies of one racial identity over another. She then paired the first names with last names by identifying real professionals with academic qualifications—medical doctors, for example—and verified their racial identities with Google Image search results. Finally, using a sample of typically Caucasian and typically African American names, she ran analysis on search results.
According to Sweeney, Google maintains that it cannot predict which advertisements—positive or negative—will be most popular, so advertisements are initially distributed at random. However, in searches of typically African-American names on Google and Reuters.com, Sweeney found between 81 to 95 percent of generated ads suggested an arrest.
“It is an interesting mirror of society,” said Sweeney, “that the Internet, which started out neutral, has begun to show racial bias.”
When asked for comment, Google spokesperson Aaron J. Stein wrote in an email that AdWords, Google's profitable advertising product, does not engage in racial profiling.
“We also have a policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organization, person or group of people,” Stein wrote. “It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads.”
Reuters.com could not immediately be reached for comment on Sweeney’s study Wednesday evening.
Sweeney said there are two possible reasons for the seemingly biased results: Google’s computer-generated algorithm may be unintentionally skewed, or Google users may choose to more frequently click on arrest advertisements that come up for black names over white names.
Gary King, director of the Institute for Qualitative Social Science at Harvard, wrote in an email that isolating the cause of the skewed search results will determine the next steps for researchers.
“Laying out the patterns, as Latanya is doing, and then ascertaining its causes and effects, is very important,” King wrote.

Harvard researchers have developed the first quantitative neuromotor assessment device, an advancement which could have repercussions for fields ranging from sports medicine to Parkinson’s disease research.
After the first clinical study involving the new technology, researchers said that the results suggest that the device generates accurate quantitative results about neuromotor function, whereby sensory information is translated into body movement.
In the study, 150 participants ranging in age from 21 to 95 traced the perimeter of a circle using a stylus on an electronic tablet. Researchers then measured and analyzed a number of factors including the errors that subjects made in tracing the perimeter.
As researchers expected, older subjects showed an overall decrease in performance, a result which the study’s authors say demonstrates the efficacy of the device. Medical School professor Lewis A. Lipsitz, who was one of the study’s authors, said that the neuroassesment device provides an “integrated measure” of the multiple systems that interact to control movement but that are difficult to measure individually.
The study was a collaboration among researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the Medical School-affiliated teaching hospital Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Hebrew SeniorLife, an elder care center based in Roslindale, Mass. The results of the study were published last week in an edition of the online Journals of Gerontology, Series A.
“A key aspect of physiology is [the question of] what makes systems resilient, robust, and able to withstand stress,” said Ary L. Goldberger, a Medical School professor and one of the study’s authors.
Medical School senior staff engineer Leia A. Stirling, the study author who led the project, said that researchers are currently using the device to study concussions. Their study involves running the device before and after an individual has sustained a concussion, she said.
Stirling said the device could be significant in the future because anyone—including coaches tending to athletes—can administer it. This usage could augment the current qualitative medical tests administered and interpreted by experts.
Researchers said the device may also be useful in providing a new quantitative way to measure rehabilitation.
“While experts have a lot of experience, they cannot easily quantify a defect in the control of movement,” Lipsitz said.

As the population on Earth continues to grow, Harvard scientists may have just stumbled upon some additional space—in the solar system. Earth-like planets, defined by the researchers as planets comparable in size and temperature to Earth, may be as close as 13 light years away, according a study conducted by third-year graduate student Courtney D. Dressing and astronomy professor David Charbonneau.
Using public data available from NASA’s Kepler mission, a project tasked with measuring changes in the brightness of stars, Dressing set out to “find out how common planets like the earth are in the galaxy.”
Dressing and Charbonneau searched the orbits of red dwarf stars—the most commonly found stars in the Milky Way galaxy—for planets similar in size and temperature to Earth.
By measuring the extent to which a planet eclipsed the light of a nearby star, the researchers discovered that about six percent of red dwarf stars have earth-like planets in their orbits. Red dwarf stars are both smaller and cooler than the Sun.
According to Dressing and Charbonneau, based on the results of the study, the search for habitable planets may be far more fruitful than previously thought.
Charbonneau said the next step in their research is to ascertain which of these earth-like planets is the closest to Earth. After this, both he and Dressing hope to conduct further research about life on these planets—a plan that is contingent upon the completion of a large telescope, most likely the Giant Magellan Telescope that is currently under construction in Chile.
The GMT will “be one of the next class of super giant earth-based telescopes that promises to revolutionize our view and understanding of the universe,” according to the telescope’s official website. The project has a planned end date of 2023.
According to the researchers, these later phases of the study, once complete, might allow for scientists to continue the search for potential extraterrestrial life forms.
“What everybody really wants to know is: are we alone?” Charbonneau said. “[Dressing’s] discovery is a very important step toward answering that question.”

A new study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health suggests that vitamin intake may play a significant role in cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes, a disease commonly associated with genetic factors.
The study, which will be published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that young adults who maintain sufficient levels of Vitamin D can reduce their risk of adult-onset type 1 diabetes by 50 to 60 percent.
Although most previous type 1 diabetes studies have investigated childhood onset, senior author and School of Public Health professor Alberto Ascherio said that patients diagnosed later in life are more likely to have been affected by environmental factors.
The researchers analyzed blood samples of active military members taken from the Department of Defense Serum Repository, comparing diabetes patients’ blood samples taken prior to disease onset with samples taken from a control group.
Although the study found that the risk of adult-onset type 1 diabetes may be significantly reduced if vitamin D levels are at least 75 nanomoles per liter, lead author and School of Public Health research associate Kassandra Munger said the results are only conclusive for non-Hispanic white males.
“We didn’t see an association in non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics, possibly due to the smaller sample size,” Munger said. “We also can’t say for sure that the same results would be seen in women.”
The research group decided to study the effects of Vitamin D on type 1 diabetes after previously finding a strong association between Vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis.
Bruce W. Hollis, professor of pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, said that the consistent results of both studies provides strong evidence that adequate Vitamin D levels can contribute to disease prevention.
“Multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes are both autoimmune disorders, and the studies basically showed the same thing,” said Hollis. “The papers have shown that you need to take three to four thousand units per day to attain appropriate blood levels to prevent diseases.”
Although additional studies are necessary before any formal recommendations for Vitamin D supplementation are made, researchers stressed the importance of achieving high Vitamin D levels.
In addition to food sources, Hollis said that one of the easiest ways to achieve these Vitamin D levels is to get sun exposure. Spending 20 minutes outside during peak sun hours releases about 20,000 units of Vitamin D into the bloodstream within 24 hours, he said.
The researchers hope to expand their studies in the future.
“I hope to study several hundred cases, study a larger sample size that includes women, and look at finer points of association,” Munger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With winter sports nearing the end of the season and spring sports getting their season underway, The Back Page takes a look at how some of your teams have been faring in recent weeks. Who has gotten off to a hot start? And who is heading in the right direction just in time to take home an Ivy title?
Men’s Swimming and Diving
The Crimson is coming off arguably one of the biggest dual meet wins in program history. Harvard topped Princeton in its home waters, the first Ivy League team ever to do so. Nemo pushed the team’s last meet, a face-off against Penn at Blodgett, to this coming weekend. The Crimson will look to remain undefeated on the season as it prepares for the ECAC and Ivy League Championships next month.
Women’s Water Polo
Harvard is off to a 5-2 start this season. The Crimson won all of its opening matches in the Harvard Home Kick Off earlier this month. Despite losing its first two games at the Princeton Invitational, the Crimson bounced back two take its next two contests by a large margin, topping NYAC, 20-9, and Villanova, 19-4. This weekend will be one to rest for the team as Harvard prepares to head to Pennsylvania for the Villanova Invite the following week.
Men’s Volleyball
Despite losing two straight at the turn of the month, the Crimson have been on the rise in February, winning its last two contests by a 3-1 margin. Harvard hopes to carry its momentum into this weekend, when it faces No. 7 Penn State and St. Francis in a pair of match-ups.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
The women capped an undefeated season in dual meets with a 199-99 win over Princeton and a 209-89 routing of Yale last weekend. The team is riding some serious momentum and good vibes as it prepares for the Ivy League and ECAC Championships in two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To make a run at the Ivy League title, the Harvard men’s basketball team will have to survive the jungle.
Almost halfway into the conference season, the Crimson has yet to take on its biggest threat—the Tigers. When Harvard welcomes Princeton to Lavietes on Saturday night, the title will be on the line.
Two weeks ago, it seemed likely that Princeton would go undefeated against its six other Ancient Eight opponents. After being ranked first in the preseason poll, the Tigers came charging into conference play. Led by senior forward Ian Hummer—second in the league behind Wes Saunders with 15.7 points per game—they picked up decisive home victories over Penn, Cornell, Columbia, and Brown, and the Tigers looked to be the strongest team in the league.
But an upset loss at the hands of Yale last weekend changed everything.
Now Harvard and Princeton each own one Ivy League loss, and provided that neither team drops another game against its other opponents, the two matchups between the Crimson and the Tigers will determine everything.
Harvard’s only loss came at the hands of Columbia, and while the lack of defense was troubling, it does not meanthat the Crimson is a weaker team. The Lions’ leading scorer in the victory was sophomore guard Steve Frankoski, who put up 27 points—20 in the first half—while shooting 71 percent from the beyond the arc.
The performance was impressive, but also a fluke. Fankoski averages a respectable 9.8 points per game and has tallied fewer than 6 points per game during conference play. Playing on the road, Harvard fell at the hands of a momentarily hot shooter.
Princeton, on the other hand, was defeated by a team that did nothing extraordinary. The Bulldogs shot over 50 percent from the field in a balanced offensive effort in which their highest scorer, guard Javier Duren, only posted 13 points.
The loss at Jadwin—which snapped the Tigers 21-game home win streak—put on display fundamental weaknesses in Princeton’s game. While the Tigers have held their opponents to 39-percent three point shooting, the Bulldogs shot over 58 percent from long range last weekend.
Going up against a dominant perimeter team like Harvard—currently leading the league at 41 percent—Princeton will be hard pressed to hold off the likes of Christian Webster, Siyani Chambers, and Laurent Rivard from deep.
Although Harvard began the season essentially relying on Saunders and Chambers to put up big points in every game to spell a lack of consistency from the rest of its starters, the team has come a long way since the start of the year.
Sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi—who lost his starting spot after a slow first five games—has developed into one of the Crimson’s strongest defensive players. He leads the team in rebounds and blocks with more than one per game.
With Mondou-Missi developing as a key defensive stopper, Harvard will be able to make things hard for Hummer. While the team was previously forced to rely on top-scorer Saunders to go up against its opponent’s big man—Allen Crabbe of Cal, for example—the sophomore now has more freedom to focus on putting points on the board.
The Crimson may look like a team that lives or dies by its three-point percentage, but the mere threat of its top shooters is enough to create open space in the paint.
Even when Harvard’s shots aren’t falling from the behind the arc—as was the case in its overtime game against Dartmouth in which Rivard went 1-7 from deep—its opponents are forced to employ aggressive perimeter defense.
Against the Big Green, Harvard took advantage of that opportunity, as sophomore forward Jonah Travis scored 14 points down low, while Chambers and Saunders relied on the dribble to combine for 22 points without hitting a single three.
Then there’s the power of Lavietes—where the Crimson will play two games this weekend and close out the season against Columbia and Cornell in March. Harvard has played half of its games on the road so far, and will split the remainder of the season between playing at home and playing away.
Princeton has a tougher road ahead with only two more home games and seven to play in hostile territory.
With eight games still to play, the Crimson is poised to use this weekend’s matchups against Penn and Princeton as a springboard for its title run—and to show that the Tigers really aren’t as scary as they seem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the road this weekend, the Harvard women’s basketball team will have a chance to unseat the champions.
After stopping at the Palestra on Friday to take on Penn (10-9, 3-2 Ivy), the Crimson (13-6, 4-1) will come face to face with Princeton (14-5, 5-0)—which has won three consecutive Ivy League titles—at Jadwin Gymnasium on Saturday.
Although Harvard swept the Quakers last year, the team has not beaten the Tigers since 2011 and has not taken both road games in the same season since 2009.
“The mindset of the team is that we are mentally and physically ready to go,” said co-captain and forward Miriam Rutzen. “We are ready to play whoever our competition is, no matter what the name is on the front of the jersey.”
On the road trip, the Crimson will square off against the two best defensive teams in the league. Princeton has allowed only 54.4 points per game, while Penn has allowed 56.8.
Harvard—the second-highest scoring team in the league with 68.6 points per game—will look towards offensive leader Christine Clark. The junior guard leads the team with 16.6 points per game.
In addition to Clark, the Crimson has relied on a number of other sources to break down its opponents’ defense.s Sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle has been a force in the paint, putting up a career-high 20 points on 75-percent shooting at Yale earlier this month.
Accounting for more than three treys per game, co-captain Emma Golen and senior forward Victoria Lippert have led the way from the perimeter, each shooting over 40 percent.
“We know that Penn and Princeton are going to play similar games in that they are very defensively aggressive,” Golen said.
For the Quakers, junior guard Alyssa Baron leads the way with 14 points per game, but she is shooting only 37 percent from the field. Penn has struggled to find the net with consistency, shooting 35 percent as a team—good for sixth in the league.
The Quakers have benefited from tight ball control, forcing more turnovers than their opponents by a league leading 2.89 average margin.
“You can never take any team or any game for granted in the Ivy League, whether you are playing the team with the best record or the worst record,” Rutzen said. “We have continued to get better and grow as a team in how we handle games that are tough.”
Against Princeton, the Crimson will look to control offensive powerhouse Niveen Rasheed. The senior guard leads the Ivy League with 16.9 points per game, and her 9.2 boards per game have helped to make the Tigers the top rebounding team in the conference.
Rasheed is the only Princeton player to average double digit points, and she has been spelled by junior forward Kristen Helmsetter, who chips in 9 points per game.
“We’re just going to try to limit [Rasheed] as much as we can and make sure she gets no easy looks,” Golen said.     “After that, they’re all pretty even as offensive threats, so we just need to focus on our matchups.”
After a tough overtime win against Cornell last weekend in which the Crimson almost let a big first-half lead slip away, the Crimson will look to maintain 40 minutes of intensity during both matchups.
The Quakers enter the weekend after having split a road trip, picking up a win at Brown after losing to Yale, while the Tigers remain undefeated—having won every Ancient Eight game by more than 30 points. Princeton put up a record 99 points in its win over Yale and extended its conference win streak to 29 games.
The Harvard co-captains said the Crimson will work on maintaining consistency and building on its leads to avoid another close call like last weekend.
“We start to feel comfortable once we get a lead, and we start to feel that we can take a lot of chances that we normally wouldn’t take in a close game,” Golen said. “I think it’s just staying composed, staying in control, and really just focusing in when we have these leads.”
The Crimson’s only Ivy League loss this season came on the road against Dartmouth after the team beat the Big Green by 22 points at home. After this weekend, Harvard will return to Lavietes for a four-game homestand.
“[Playing on the road] is definitely not ideal, and that’s something unique about the Ivy League, that you have two back-to-back games in pretty hostile environments,” Golen said. “We’re hoping not to let it bother us and just go win two basketball games.”

Heading into the weekend, the Crimson looked to be on a roll. They had won 11 of their last 14 games, with the three losses coming to 2012 tournament teams—Memphis, St. Mary’s, and Connecticut. All three games were on the road, and in each Harvard was in the game late into the second half.
The Crimson was 4-0 in the Ivy League, holding on by the skin of its teeth, but still displaying that “clutch” factor at the end of games. Leads shrank and Lavietes Pavillion grew restless, but Harvard always seemed to hang on. Last Friday’s game at Cornell was more of the same—the Crimson led by as much as 21, but didn’t score for the final 5:42 and won by just two points.
And then came Columbia.
The Lions came out on Sunday and blitzed Harvard. Guard Steve Frankowski scored 27 points—20 coming in the first half—and Columbia shot a blistering 51 percent from the field and 53 percent from behind the arc. The lions beat the Crimson on the glass (four more offensive rebounds, eight more overall), played better team ball (18 assists to six), and took better care of the ball (three fewer turnovers). The result: a 15-point victory that Harvard fans should have seen coming.
Getting away by the skin of your teeth time after time is not a viable strategy for long-term success. In Harvard’s first five Ivy League games, it was twice down double-digits late before waking up just in time (Dartmouth on the road and again at home), and thrice nearly blew late double-digit leads with poor free throw shooting down the stretch (Brown, Cornell, Yale). Down the stretch, those teams revealed Harvard’s vulnerability and showed the Ivy League race to be wide open.
The Crimson offense consists of four roving perimeter players with a big man rotating in the middle and establishing good post position. The strategy is dependent on Harvard’s lights-out shooters. The team shoots a combined 41 percent from three and guards Wesley Saunders and Siyani Chambers both shoot better than 46 percent from that range. But when the jump shots aren’t falling, the Crimson struggles to put points on the board.
In the two teams’ second meeting, Dartmouth employed an aggressive man-to-man defense against Harvard and contained sharpshooter Laurent Rivard, who shot just one for seven from three on the day. The entire team made a combined five of 21 shots from distance.
The way to break man-to-man defense is with offensive players who can take their men off the dribble and get to the middle. The Crimson has two guards who do so consistently—Chambers and Saunders. However, when either one of the two is out, the team struggles to create offense and often ends possessions with ill-advised threes.
Chambers’ worrying foul tendency amplifies this problem. He picked up four in the second Dartmouth game and would have fouled out late if not for an overturned call. Against Brown, his four early fouls limited him to 28 minutes and the offense struggled without him. Against Memphis, Chambers’ fifth foul coincided with the Tigers’ 12-2 run to finish the game.
With Harvard boasting a cushy two-game lead against the non-Princeton Ancient Eight field, it is easy to look at the schedule as “the two Princeton games and everything else”. After all, with the Tigers only a half-game back of the Crimson, Harvard likely needs to defeat Princeton at least once.
However, three games stand out on the schedule besides those played against the Tigers. Friday’s game against Penn looms as a classic trap game the day before the highly anticipated matchup with a hated rival.
The week after, road games at Brown and Yale—teams whom Harvard was already lucky to escape from once—may very well decide the Ivy League outcome. And then there’s the trip to Jadwin, where Princeton lost Saturday for the first time in three years.
Harvard has not yet played a 40-minute game of good basketball against an Ivy League team. The Crimson is 4-6 on the road with four Ivy League road games still to be played. However, the team has two great opportunities to take control of the Ivy League this weekend. But should it neglect to capitalize, Harvard might find itself looking up in the standings for the rest of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The bend-but-don’t-break strategy finally caught up with the Harvard men’s basketball team.
After winning its first five Ivy League contests by an average margin of 5.4 points, the Crimson fell to Columbia by 15 on Sunday, failing to capitalize on an opportunity to go up 1.5 games on Princeton in the conference standings.
“I think there’s a lot of disappointment in how we played against Columbia, there’s no question about it,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose team was outshot 50.9 to 42.9 percent by the Lions. “We’ve lost some tough games, and this last one was a little bit of a head scratcher.”
The Crimson doesn’t have much time to get its act together, as Harvard (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) welcomes Penn (5-17, 2-3) and Princeton (11-8, 4-1) to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend.
The Crimson has failed to sweep a Penn-Princeton weekend in seven of its last eight opportunities.
Part of the difficulty may stem from the teams’ contrasting styles. While Princeton boasts one of the conference’s biggest lineup, starting five players 6’5” or taller, Penn relies more heavily on its athleticism.
“We really try to prepare for both teams in practice,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “But most importantly, we just try to focus on us and not really get caught up in what the other team does. We feel like if we do what we do effectively and execute, then that will take care of itself.”
Assuming both Harvard and Princeton take care of business on Friday night against Penn and Dartmouth, respectively, Saturday’s matchup between the Crimson and Tigers will determine the Ivy League favorite heading into the second half of conference play.
The preseason pick to win the Ancient Eight, Princeton has the league’s top defense as well as the conference’s top forward—6’7” senior Ian Hummer.
The Crimson, which starts four perimeter players, has struggled to contain talented bigs this season. In back-to-back contests in early December, Harvard surrendered 23 points to both 6’8” BC forward Ryan Anderson and 6’8” UConn forward DeAndre Daniels.
Within the Ivy League, Harvard has fared better against its stiffest post competition. In two games against Dartmouth, 6’9” forward Gabas Maldunas was held below his season scoring average—though the sophomore did connect on seven of 13 attempts.
But Hummer is a different beast. The preseason favorite for Ivy Player of the Year, Hummer has done it all for Princeton this season, as his 15.7 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists are good for tops on the Tigers and second, fourth, and third in the conference, respectively.
As impressive as Hummer’s numbers have been, the Crimson needs only to remember its past matchups with the Tigers to know the problems Hummer presents. In five contests against Harvard over the past two seasons, Hummer has averaged 15.2 points.
“We haven’t had an answer for him through the years,” Amaker said. “He’s very rugged, very physical, but yet he’s fluid enough to be on the perimeter.”
“He’s a nightmare of a matchup, so we’re going to have our hands full again,” continued Amaker, who added that the Crimson may throw a handful of different defenders at Hummer.
While much attention has been paid to Hummer, the Tigers’ other players pose threats as well.
Sophomore forward Denton Koon—Princeton’s No. 2 scorer—boasts the conference’s third best field goal percentage. On the perimeter, junior point guard TJ Bray averages 8.9 points and a league-best 2.0 steals per game, while junior forward Will Barrett leads the league in three-point shooting.
But before Saturday’s matchup between the league’s top two teams, the Crimson will face an unpredictable Quakers team that is coming off a weekend split with Brown and Yale.
“I think Penn is a lot better than their record, there’s no doubt about that,” said Amaker of the 5-17 Quakers. “They could be a team that could still be, I think, a contender in our league. I think they’re that good even though they’re missing some pieces.”
One of those pieces is junior forward Fran Dougherty, who went down with an elbow injury against Cornell two weekends ago after starting the season averaging 13.8 points per game.
With Dougherty out, Penn will likely lean more heavily on junior guard Miles Cartwright. The Ivy League’s fourth-leading scorer, Cartwright is coming off a 28-point performance in Penn’s 71-48 victory over Brown last weekend.
Rookie guard Tony Hicks has posted in double-digits in each of the last three contests.
“Watching them on film, probably of all the teams I’ve seen in our league so far, I think they play the hardest, really exert so much energy and effort,” Amaker said. “Looking to that game, I think our hands are going to be full trying to deal with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the world saw an event come to pass for the first time since 1415, igniting widespread mourning, speculation of scandal, and spiritual crises: The Crimson failed to cover a conference basketball game live.
Yea, verily I say unto thee, a winter tempest prevented our heroes from emerging from their stronghold city of Cambridge to undertake the long, wicked road to Sheol, or, as it was renamed by its later inhabitants, Ithaca. The incident will remind longtime readers of that early 15th century spring day, when beat writer Sherman the Bold was waylaid on his route to Old Haven by a troop of marauding raiders. “Sword wavin’ Old Haven,” Sherman was said to mutter as he expired on the lonely highway.
But we journalists were far from the only Ivy folks thrown off by Nemo’s wrath. In another history lesson, Harvard played a Sunday conference game for the first time since a February 13, 1994 victory at Columbia after Saturday’s contest was postponed due to weather. Once more, the Lions were the foe in New York City, but Columbia did not keep holy the Sabbath, doing irreverent things to the Crimson on its way to a 78-63 drubbing. The loss was all the more sour for Harvard given Princeton’s loss to Yale the day before; the Crimson missed its chance to put some breathing room between itself and the Tigers at the top of the Ivy standings. Now the two are again locked in a death tussle, the first round of which will be decided this Saturday. Let’s get to the games.
CORNELL at YALE
Following the Bulldogs’ stunning road upset of Princeton on Saturday, one might have expected bold fonts and exclamation points from a lesser student newspaper covering the event. But, when greeted by success, every veteran knows the necessity of acting like you’ve been there before. That’s why the Yale Daily News didn’t give the upset its own article, and @YDNsports waited a day before composing an original tweet to acknowledge the victory. No need to spike the football.
Pick: Cornell
PENN at HARVARD
The Quakers have gone 2-8 in the absence of one of the league’s top forwards, junior Fran Dougherty, who missed a month of action with mononucleosis, returned to action Feb. 1 against Columbia, and promptly dislocated his elbow a game later. Then again, Penn is 3-9 with Dougherty. As long as it contains junior guard Miles Cartwright, this should be a comfortable one for the Crimson—if there is such a thing.
Pick: Harvard
PRINCETON at DARTMOUTH
I suppose it’s possible that the Tigers might be caught looking ahead to the next night’s matchup in Cambridge and forget about their date in Hanover. But I think Princeton could play the whole game facing in a south-southeasterly direction, looking toward Cambridge, and still win this game. I’m taking the Tigers in a rout.
Pick: Princeton
COLUMBIA at BROWN
It was a tough weekend for Brown basketball, which endured two losses by a combined 40 points in its trip to the Killer P’s. Better news for the university is that Kendrick Lamar was announced as the headliner for its spring concert, outdoing Yale’s Spring Fling, which will feature Macklemore as its lead act. I’m preemptively disappointed for whoever is coming to Yardfest—which, to be clear, I blame on the administration’s vision for the event, not on the selection committee. Hey, I hear Dean Dingman’s cousin has a guitar. Maybe he can build some community.
Pick: Columbia
CORNELL at BROWN
This yawn-inducing Ivy League matchup will be played at Brown’s own Pizzitola Sports Center, or “the Pizza,” as I will disrespectfully refer to it. Did you know John Heisman went to Brown? Yeah, the guy with the trophy. It so happens that one of the lobbies inside the Pizza is named after him. One of the most distinguished athletic alumni in the university’s history gets a lobby inside a building called…the Pizza. Get the man a weight room, at least.
Pick: Cornell
COLUMBIA at YALE
Yale’s Javier Duren won Ivy Player of the Week for his performance last weekend. Here are his combined numbers: 24 points on 44 percent shooting, nine-for-nine from the free throw line, nine rebounds, and two assists. Harvard’s Wesley Saunders did not win Ivy Player of the Week for his performance last weekend. Here are his combined numbers: 41 points on 61 percent shooting, 12-for-14 from the free throw line, five rebounds, and two assists. Javier Duren has a flattop hair cut. DJ Jazzy Jeff is an Ivy League lobbyist.
Pick: Yale
PENN at DARTMOUTH
These two teams have played a combined 11 conference games, and already they are both all but irrelevant in the race for the league title. The 14-game tournament that is the Ivy season is a meritocracy, which fits well with the missions of the universities that compose the conference, but must be infinitely frustrating to the five or six schools who have nothing to play for by mid-to late-February. One wonders if this sentiment will eventually push the league toward a postseason tournament. But it won’t be anytime soon, as Ivy League bylaws require administrators to commune with Teddy Roosevelt’s ghost and hatch a dragon before they can be secure in altering “tradition.”
Pick: Penn
PRINCETON at HARVARD
In conference play, the Crimson’s current starting lineup—freshman guard Siyani Chambers, senior guard Christian Webster, Saunders, junior guard Laurent Rivard, and sophomore forward Jonah Travis—allows 1.17 points per possession and scores 1.08 PPP, per the Ivy Basketball Twitter account (the NCAA average is around 0.99). However, the defense ratchets up when sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi enters the game for Travis; Harvard gives up just 0.92 PPP with this lineup, while putting up 1.32 PPP. Moundou-Missi recorded six blocks against Columbia, and the Crimson will need more of that defense to match up with Princeton’s big front line. Harvard fans can hope the team’s coaching staff has glanced at the stat sheet recently.
Pick: Princeton

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly series by The Back Page, Harvard beat writers will discuss topics about a Crimson athletics team. In this edition, basketball beat writers Hope Schwartz and David Freed discussed the men’s basketball team’s future in the Ivy League as well as their frontcourt rotation and ability to close out games.
Cordelia F. Mendez: The team is facing its second road weekend of the season and will have to meet its most difficult opponent, Princeton. How can Harvard even hope to stop or slow down the Tigers given that they put up a program-high 99 points last week?
Samantha Lin: Princeton is clearly coming off of a high following its 46-point rout of Yale, a team that Harvard bested by less than a third of that margin. Look for its attack to come from Niveen Rasheed, a senior guard who put up 29 points against the Bulldogs and has yet to score in single digits in league play. I think that if the Crimson is able to slow Rasheed, the team has the potential to pull off this upset. Who do you think will be assigned this task?
CFM: Princeton is exceptionally good at holding their opponents down. No Ivy squad has lost by less than 30 points to them, and at 6'0", Rasheed is certainly a guard to contend with. Harvard will need to provide pressure in the paint with taller players like 6'4" Temi Fagbenle and 6'0" Victoria Lippert. Convincing double-digit scoring performances from Fagbenle in her last three games have elevated the Crimson over Ancient Eight foes. Speaking of the Ancient Eight, it's too easy to ignore Penn and playing at the Palestra. What should the Crimson do to make sure they don't repeat blowing its second half lead against a weaker opponent? 
SL: You can never count Penn out. At only a game behind Harvard, the Quakers are definitely still in the hunt for an Ivy title. They are clearly a team that improves in the second half, too—they’ve outscored all of their Ancient Eight rivals in the second half all year, even in their loss to Yale last weekend, while the Crimson seems quick to start but struggles down the stretch. Keeping the ball away from the opponent will be key against Penn and Princeton; 17 turnovers against teams like those can cost victories. Last year's team coughed it up 15 times in a tough loss against the Tigers. What are your predictions for this weekend, given the performance by the Crimson on Sunday and Princeton's seven-game winning streak? 
CFM: My thoughts? Harvard over the Quakers by seven, especially if Christine Clark, Fagbenle and Lippert are really on. The Quakers are weak behind the arc, and if the Crimson can find some magic from Emma Golen, this should be a pretty solid W. I'm going to have to go with Princeton over Harvard, though. Playing at Jadwin isn't easy for any visitor, and against the hot-handed Tigers, it will be a tough task for the Crimson. The women of Harvard basketball can hope to take some of the good karma that Yale’s men's basketball team had when it upset the home favorites. What are your predictions?
SL: I'm going to take Harvard by 10 in its opener for the weekend. A solid 5-inch advantage that our starting lineup has over Penn's should help Harvard dominate the inside, even if the treys aren't falling (which could very well happen, considering the 3-for-18 performance the Crimson displayed against the Big Red). But if Rasheed and company defend their home territory and play with the same intensity that they've shown throughout league play thus far, I think Harvard may have some trouble in Jersey this Saturday. Princeton by 10 at home.

Tomorrow is February 14th, which means that it is Single Appreciation Day or SAD—not to be confused with Seasonal Affective Disorder. SAD is the time to celebrate your singleness regardless of any vitamin D deficiencies. So here are a few things that you can do to ensure that you have a happy SAD.
1. Make it Facebook Official
Change your relationship status from single…to single. Or, if as in my case, you are currently in a "relationship" with a platonic friend, change it from sister-wife to single. You should also change your profile picture to something that involves a mirror or you hugging yourself from behind.
2. Go "Shopping"
Go to CVS and calculate the cost of the chocolates, singing-cards, and general hygiene products that you would have had to buy if you actually had a Valentine. Depending on how active your sweat glands are, you may have saved as much as 20 dollars! Congratulate yourself—your singleness has made you fiscally responsible.
3. Treat Yourself
Take that money that you would have spent on deodorant and stimulate the economy by taking yourself to a nice restaurant. Proudly ask the hostess for a table for one and a kids' menu so that you can play tic-tac-toe and write haikus to yourself. Don't forget that "forever alone" has five syllables!
4. Ink it Up
Always wanted a tattoo but never knew whose name to permanently ink on your body? Or maybe you just want another excuse to visit the cute tattoo artist in the Garage? Today is the perfect way to celebrate your independence by tattooing your own name on your arm, chest or inner lip. Bonus points if you can figure out how to make your name dance.
