After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thursday, November 29, was a historic day. Palestine’s status in the United Nations was upgraded to a “non-member observer state,” implying that the UN now recognizes the existence of a Palestinian state. One hundred and fifty countries voted in favor of formally acknowledging that four million Palestinians can call the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their country, and only nine voted against. Israel, the United States, Canada, and a smattering of Pacific Island nations voluntarily wrote themselves into the history books as villains to Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Israel needs to realize that using tactics of oppression to undermine the possibility of a two-state solution are outdated and must change to reflect recent developments. Meanwhile, the United States must learn that it is alone in its unilateral support of Israel and should do more to support the Palestinian Authority in the face of Israeli belligerency.
UN recognition of Palestine should be an important step forward to finally establishing a secure state for the Palestinians. But Israel’s approach to the “Palestinian problem” is outdated and requires re-evaluation in light of the recent U.N. vote. For a long time, Israel has used brute force to agitate the Palestinian territories and used the dysfunction caused by Israeli meddling as an excuse to not bring any realistic demands to the negotiating table. The Israeli embargo on the Gaza Strip, which prevents goods like construction materials from passing in to the area, only convinces Palestinians that peaceful diplomatic efforts are failing and that violence is the only way to defend Palestinian interests. The Israeli government has used the separation wall and Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank to prevent a geographically coherent potential Palestinian state. Israel does this under the guise of security. However, the Israeli government needs to understand that the best way to promote its country’s security is to convince the rest of the world that they are no longer oppressing Palestinians and rather intend to live alongside them in peace.
Unfortunately, Israel’s actions after the UN vote demonstrate that the hawkish Netanyahu administration cares little for a two-state solution. In fact, Israel revealed on Friday that it would commence with construction plans for 3,000 settler homes in a highly contentious area known as E1 in the West Bank, a move that was immediately condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Israel then announced that it would withhold $120 million in tax revenues that it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.
These moves come on the heels of a bloody Israeli military operation on the Gaza Strip, which killed more than 150 Palestinians, including many women and children. This was an extreme response to a Hamas operation that killed only a few Israelis. The deaths of innocent Palestinians do nothing but increase support for Hamas’ terrorist activities in the West Bank, weakening the non-violent Palestinian Authority that currently governs the West Bank. If Israel ever wants peace, it must stop antagonizing the Palestinians. The rest of the world has spoken, and overwhelming international support for the creation of a Palestinian state is clear. It is time for Israel to get on board, too.
The United States, too, is on the wrong side of history. Just a year ago, President Obama threatened to veto Palestine’s bid to achieve full member status of the United Nations. Recently, he pledged support for the recent occupation of the Gaza Strip, despite news of IDF soldiers killing entire Palestinian families in Gaza and shooting dead Palestinians protesting against the IDF in the West Bank. Israel has long been an important ally to the United States, but unwavering U.S. support for Israeli belligerency is unacceptable in light of the death of innocents. American support for Israel has long been unpopular in the Middle East and has proven to be a major diplomatic obstacle between newly democratic Arab countries such as Egypt. It is time for America to do the right thing and work toward establishing a state of Palestine, even if that means ignoring the more aggressive demands of Israel.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated shortly after the UN vote, “The moment has arrived for the world to say clearly: enough of aggression, settlements and occupation…[and] issue a birth certificate of the reality of the State of Palestine.” I hope that we can continue to talk about the “State of Palestine” and “the Palestinian government” rather than “the occupied territories.” But perhaps this is too hopeful: Today, Israel holds all the cards in its Likud-ruled hands and has America’s indefatigable support as the ace up its sleeve. The history books have yet to be written, and I can only hope that the political tide in Israel will turn and future Israeli governments will show a gentler hand in the coming years.

The names are secret, but the club certainly isn’t. As The Crimson has reported, and as news outlets across the country and beyond have echoed, the Office of Student Life has officially recognized Munch, a discussion-based group for students interested in kinky sex. This formal recognition promises to foster openness and tolerance toward alternative sexual preferences. It also provides the welcomed potential for a more robust approach to sexual education and health.
Sexual proclivities outside the mainstream remain severely marginalized—hence Munch members’ reluctance to disclose their identities. No single campus group will change that, but Munch can provide an important movement toward tolerance, at least locally. The group’s mission statement characterizes itself as “a forum for students interested in alternative sexualities to explore their identities and develop a community with their peers,” and this forum is one that has been regrettably missing. Of course, top-down recognition on the College’s part, while laudable, is no panacea. It merely marks the end of the beginning for Munch on campus. An important onus remains. It rests in part on Munch itself to expand and promote its efforts for discussion and openness as well as on the student body as a whole to learn and to dialogue.
Part of that learning and dialogue, hopefully, will center on sexual health and education. Personal opinions aside, Munch’s subject matter is a reality for many. Given that fact, the new organization has the opportunity to expand campus safety and education efforts for alternative sexual interests. Education works. As one comprehensive, meta-analytic study has noted, with participants, fittingly, of mean age 20.3, sexual education is significantly correlated with changing knowledge and attitudes toward rape, as well as changes in behavioral intent and incidences of sexual assault (with smaller samples, but still significant findings, for the latter two). Munch has an opportunity, even a responsibility, to leverage its new official position to educate and to encourage health and safety.
The group’s constitution includes encouraging efforts on related fronts. It mandates Harvard-based and external safety training for Munch’s board members. Further, it creates a “safety team,” with goals that include dealing with sexual assault allegations as well as propagating and clarifying the group’s policies on consent.
We endorse these efforts and, on a more basic level, believe that the College’s decision to sanction Munch makes simple sense. Munch constitutes a sufficiently large group of students sharing a desire to learn about and discuss a common interest. After jumping through the OSL’s requisite sanctioning hoops, Munch deserved recognition as an official student organization. The whir of national publicity surrounding the College’s decision is, in a way, unfortunate. The sensationalized reaction betrays a need for the very service that groups like Munch aim to provide: a mature approach to and acceptance of alternative sexual interests. Paradoxically, then, we hope the newly minted Munch proves a helpful step toward its own obsolescence—toward an open and tolerant future when we no longer need it.

When pressed to make predictions, pundits sometimes retort that they are “not in the prediction-making business.” They say this, of course, because they don’t want to leave their results-disoriented business. The trick is to make a prediction so far in the future that no one could check if you were right anyway. With that in mind, I predict that there will not be an independent Palestinian state by 2040.
Three major events happened over the last month in Palestine: Gaza and Israel waged an eight-day battle, Palestine became a non-member observer state at the United Nations, and Israel simultaneously cut their aid to the Palestinian Authority and expanded the construction of settlements in East Jerusalem. Collectively, these actions symbolize another lost generation on the never-ending path to peace and Palestinian statehood.
Let’s look at each event individually.
There are a couple of very bad ways to understand the conflict in Gaza. Unfortunately, these are also the most popular ways. The first one is to count dead bodies and then use them to make an argument about “ethics.” If you are seeking the laziest moral standard possible, just remember, whichever side had the lowest number of people die is automatically the bad guy!
Another fallacious way to understand the conflict is to ask who started it. Israel technically broke a peace agreement when it killed Al-Jabari, Hamas’s military commander. But Hamas is officially committed to Israel’s destruction, so all peace deals are temporary. Al-Jabari himself led an operation that smuggled hundreds of rockets from Iran into Gaza through Sudan and Egypt.
The latest battle between Gaza and Israel really revolves around the development of military technology over the last 10 years, not to mention Iran’s pivotal role in that development. Whereas Gaza’s rockets in the 2008 engagement with Israel were highly inaccurate and faulty, often with a range under 10 miles, the new Fajr-5 rockets weigh more than 2,000 pounds and are capable of reaching Tel Aviv. Although Israel and Gaza arrived at some sort of peace agreement, Hamas’s new access to high-level Iranian military technology raises the stakes both within Palestine and across the region.
Unlike the conflict in Gaza, the “achievement” of non-member observer state status by Palestine’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, could probably be described as a charade. Crowds in the West Bank greeted Abbas like a conquering hero, which a cynical observer could describe as the only concrete goal of the vote at the United Nations.
Abbas claimed that his effort to receive non-member observer state status for Palestine was motivated by the stalled status of peace negotiations with Israel and the continued developments of settlements. That’s half nonsense. The Palestinian Authority’s long-time president desperately sought public support as Gaza slipped further from his sphere of influence and he appeared helpless in the face of Israeli settlement construction. Regardless of whether one wants to attribute Abbas’s move to Israeli intransigence or his own motivation to stay in power, the move unequivocally sets back the peace process.
Regardless, Abbas will need all the public support he can garner in the West Bank, too, if the International Monetary Fund’s economic predictions are correct. The IMF’s mission chief for the West Bank, Oussama Kanaan, predicted in September that the Palestinian economy would soon experience an economic slump and a spike in unemployment. He blamed Israel’s limits on Palestinian trade and a severe drawback in donor money from the Arab world.
This brings us to the latest event. In the aftermath of the vote at the United Nations, Israel quickly responded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the planning and zoning for construction in the area of West Bank town, Ma’ale Adumim. Building in that area would “make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian state.”
Yesterday, Israel chose to withhold its transfer of tax revenues to the Palestinian Authority, accusing them of violating peace deals by upgrading their status at the United Nations. This will only exacerbate the social unrest engendered by the West Bank’s economic slump.
In the coming decades, observers will ask themselves how the region slid from the promise of the Oslo Accords to these lows. They may discover that this last month’s events were the watershed moment when both sides committed their next generation of youth to the never-ending conflict.
As someone with close Israeli and Palestinian friends, I sincerely hope that the passing of time will prove me wrong. History may prove once again that pundits should avoid the prediction-making business.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty plus years ago, I was chatting with a friend who was a faculty member in the Harvard economics department while we were watching our sons play in a soccer game.  I had asked him what, if anything, the department was doing about the lack of racial diversity among its faculty.  He acknowledged the problem but commented that there was a very sparse supply of African American economists.
I asked, “What about Andrew Brimmer?” Brimmer, who died in the early fall of 2012, had been the first African American on the Federal Reserve Board. He had received his doctorate from Harvard Business School in 1957, had published professional articles in highly regarded economics journals, had served in various government advisory boards here and abroad, and had even been on the faculty of HBS for a couple of years. It all added up to distinguished career as an economist.
My friend met my question about Brimmer with the comment, “Oh, well, he doesn’t do what we do.”
I don’t recall more of our conversation, but I do recall that I was stunned by this comment. Isn’t a central point of diversity to get people who don’t “do what we do”? There is, of course, no automatic connection between the color of one’s skin and one’s approach to economic issues. But there is little doubt that on a broad level there is a connection between personal experiences—and certainly race affects personal experiences—and how one approaches economic and social issues.
Brimmer was born the child of Louisiana sharecroppers. In 1973, while still a member of the Federal Reserve Board, he told the New York Times, “I do feel that the economic plight of blacks is a serious matter.  So I bring the same economist’s tool kit to that subject as other economists bring to examine other national economic problems.”
In my experience at Harvard many years ago, Brimmer’s issues were not totally absent from the agenda of members of the faculty, but neither were they priorities. He did not “do what we do.”
In the past few decades some things have changed both at Harvard and in the economics profession generally. But there has been only limited attention paid to the issues that were so important to Brimmer. There has also been minimal opening to alternative ideological approaches—and, don’t kid yourself, economics is a highly ideological field.
The narrowness of economics, the insistence on doing “what we do,” has had some substantial implications. Working within relatively narrow ideological confines, the great majority of economists at Harvard and elsewhere missed the development of the severe financial crisis that emerged in 2007-2008. And as best I can tell, there has been no serious self-examination by the economics profession regarding its failure to see the storm coming. Indeed, some prominent economists have simply denied that events of the last decade indicate anything is wrong in the profession!
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, I was part of a group of “radical” junior faculty members and graduate students in the Harvard economics department who tried to introduce some alternative ways of dealing with economic issues. We saw ourselves as connected to the widespread upheaval of social movements in that era: the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, and anti-poverty struggles. More than anything else, I think what defined our approach and what differentiated us from the mainstream of economics was that we tried to bring issues of political and social power into our analyses of economic issues
I hardly need to say that we did not last long at Harvard. Our approach to economics was not welcomed by a majority of the senior faculty in the department of economics. Regardless of the formal expertise of some members of our group, on an ideological level all of us failed to “do what we do.”
By and large, now as then, when economists do recognize our society’s economic problems, they see those problems as calling at most for some adjustments around the edges. Economic ills are dealt with as technical difficulties. Issues of power are pretty much absent from the discussion. We tried to bring issues of power to the forefront 40-some years ago, and we are still trying.
The current doldrums of the U.S. economy and the extreme economic inequality that has emerged in the last few decades are forcing some changes in the way most people who aren’t economists look at things. The Occupy Wall Street movement forced inequality and power onto the public agenda. Maybe the economics profession will get the message.  Maybe at Harvard and elsewhere economists will realize that there may be some value in not doing “what we do.”
Arthur MacEwan is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts Boston. He was faculty member in the Harvard department of economics from 1968 to 1975. His most recent book is Economic Collapse, Economic Change: Getting to the Roots of the Crisis (2011).

Forty-five years of close friendship filled more than 70 voices with laughter and familiarity at the Episcopal Divinity School’s St. John’s Chapel yesterday, where members of the 1967 Radcliffe Choral Society and Harvard Glee Club joined together for the 45th Reunion Concert of their 1967 Asian Tour.
“It was just such an important time in each of our lives,” said RCS member Margo S. Palmer ’69 of the tour, which took 90 Harvard singers to perform concerts in Hawaii, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, India, Israel, and the former Yugoslavia. “We spent 11 weeks on the road with each other.”
The tour members reunite for a concert every five years to commemorate fellow singers who have passed away. More than 75 percent of the original group traveled from around the world to perform on Sunday.
“It’s such a tight group,” said Palmer. “We pick up where we left off five years ago.”
Sunday’s concert was conducted by Daniel Hathaway ’67, who served as assistant conductor on the Asian Tour with the late Elliot Forbes. The concert featured an array of songs from the original tour.
Hathaway opened the concert with a warning that the chorus had not had many hours to rehearse, but added with a smile that members would greet the musical selections like old friends.
Elizabeth A. Karan ’16, a student in Music 1a: Introduction to Western Music from the Middle Ages to Mozart, said she appreciated the “beautiful” harmony of more mature voices.
While time has changed the musical tone of the group, Stephen L. Griffith ’67, the president of the Asian Tour, said that the years have allowed members to fully acknowledge the profound importance of the tour for each choral member.
“We’ve begun to appreciate just how significant that time was in our lives. Our experience at Harvard was just the beginning of our friendship with each other and with music,” he said.
Griffith noted that the majority of the chorus members have incorporated music into their post-graduate life, whether they sing in a community choir or hold professional musical positions.
The remaining members of the original Asian Tour are planning another reunion—along with a charity concert series—in the Rocky Mountain region.
“We’re just going to keep going because we enjoy each other’s company and making good music,” Griffith said.

Students in classrooms across three continents met online Friday morning to discuss questions of ethics as part of Michael J. Sandel’s efforts to create a global learning environment.
The “Justice” lecture—which was the last of three international lectures—brought together students in Sao Paolo, Shanghai, New Delhi, Tokyo, and Sanders Theatre.
“The global classroom experiment takes the distance out of distance learning,” Sandel said. “It uses new technology to invite the world into the Harvard classroom.”
“Justice” teaching fellow Joshua L. Cherniss said that the presence of international students in conversations has provided valuable new perspectives and insights for Harvard students.
“I think it is important that whenever talking about issues to avoid parochialism and narrow mindedness,” he said. “Certainly talking to people from other cultures is valuable in protecting from parochialism.”
Cherniss also said that the experiment has been effective at revealing the common ground between students from different cultures.
“[It has been interesting to see] how similar what students from other countries say [is] to what students in our sections say,” he said.
Despite the opportunity for discussion with students from across the world, “Justice” teaching fellow Sungho Kimlee said that he believes that including extra global classroom lectures has led to a drop in enrollment for the course.
This year approximately 400 students enrolled in Justice as compared to 800 or 900 in past years, he said.
Daniel A. Schwartz ’16, a student enrolled in the course, said that he was interested in hearing more from Sandel and less from other students regardless of whether they hail from Sanders Theatre or Shanghai.
However, he said that he thinks the addition of global perspectives makes the class stronger overall.
“The experience of each group’s responding to the questions in its own cultural context is a powerful tool for forcing individuals to question the source and validity of their convictions,” said Schwartz.
Sandel said that this sort of questioning is what the development of the global classroom was meant to facilitate.
“It was exciting to see students wrestle with these hard ethical questions across national and cultural boundaries,” Sandel said. “It offers us a glimpse of what a global public discourse might be.”

Ten Iraq and Afghanistan veterans will learn to apply their military skills to the private sector during a three week business training program in which Harvard Business School professors and lecturers will serve as mentors.
The initiative, organized by the Fullbridge Program and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, is “a bit of an entrepreneurial boot camp,” said Michael Preston, strategic partnerships associate at IAVA.
The veterans will be chosen from a pool of over 300 applicants and will engage in everything from coursework on presentations to classes on finance, according to Preston.
Candice C. Olson, co-CEO and co-founder of the Fullbridge Program, said that one of the most important and unique aspects of the program are the personal mentors, who come from an array of top universities including HBS.
In addition to helping veterans translate their military skills into the private sector, mentors will also teach veterans new skills and evaluate veterans both professionally and academically in order to help them create a “career vision”, Olson said.
She added that in addition to personal mentoring on career vision, veterans will attend a two day career vision piece created in collaboration with Timothy Butler, director of career development programs at HBS.
IAVA founder and Executive Director Paul Rieckhoff said that veterans often face challenges becoming a part of the workforce once they return home.
“The numbers don’t lie—Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are struggling to find work once they return home. New veteran unemployment is well above the national average—two percentage points in October 2012 alone,” wrote Rieckhoff in a press release.
Preston said that the program will aim to not only educate veterans, but also to help employers understand the value of veterans’ unique skill sets.
Olson said she is confident that this program would prove a success.
Veterans “are a very talented, tested, group of people,” she said.

The 13 Deans of Harvard University announced two University-wide innovation challenges focused on culture and health on Thursday. Student teams in both challenges will win up to $75,000 in prize money to further develop their proposals.
One of the contents—the Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge—focuses on the arts, seeking out students who can develop proposals that address solutions for supporting the arts and expanding its role in society. The other challenge—the Health and Life Sciences Challenge—seeks innovative solutions for improving health delivery across the globe.
According to the email announcement, these challenges are building on the highly successful President’s Challenge, which in its second year invites student-led teams to propose and develop solutions concerning broad global social issues.
“With over 500 Harvard students participating last year in the President’s Challenge and a lot of enthusiasm from students so far for [this year’s] President’s Challenge, the Deans recognized the opportunity to offer what are called Deans’ Challenges” said Gordon S. Jones, managing director of the Harvard Innovation Lab.
Harvard’s announcement mentioned the declining public and private funding for the arts as part of the impetus for the Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge.
“You have a model today where funding from government or non-governmental agencies for the arts is drying up and there’s a lot of need for more interest in where are the innovative solutions,” said Jones. He added that more money is raised for the arts through Kickstarter, a funding platform, than through the National Endowment for the Arts.
According the Challenge’s website, The Health and Life Sciences Challenge focuses on four areas: redesign of health delivery: changing behavior: computation and data analysis in therapy discovery, personalized medicine and public health: and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.
The cultural and health challenge proposals will be due in late February and early March of next year respectively. After facing evaluation by the judging committee, the finalists will be announced and given $5,000 to develop their proposals. In May, the winner and runner-ups of each  challenge will be announced, with the winner and runner-ups of each challenge splitting a $75,000 prize.
The Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge will officially begin on Dec. 6 with Yo-Yo Ma set to perform and speak at the kick-off event, while the Health and Life Sciences Challenge will launch on December 11 with a speech by Professor Richard T. Lee. Both events will be at the Harvard Innovation Laboratory.
Jones said that despite the presence of graduate and doctoral students in the challenge, he believes undergraduates have the chance to make a significant difference.
“I think they’re often willing to take risks in certain areas, for some reason, folks post-college may not be willing to,” Jones said, “I think there’s a mindset that says ‘how can I make an impact,’” said Jones.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Dec. 3
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge kick-off event. It will be held on Dec. 6.

Residents of Boston and Cambridge congregated in Harvard Square on Saturday to decry American support for Egypt’s new president, Mohamed Morsi, in a protest that channeled the spirit of ongoing revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa.
Morsi, elected to the Egyptian presidency in June of this year, has been subject to a maelstrom of controversy since asserting what opponents deem dictatorial policies over the Egyptian judiciary.
“We’ve gathered here today because of what’s happening in Egypt,” said Rafaat Mousad, one of the leaders of the protest. “We denounce the oppressive dictatorship of the new president, Mohamed Morsi, and the fact that he is trying to work out a new constitution that will marginalize all minorities.”
Critics are particularly concerned about Morsi’s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist Islamic organization with branches in many Arab nations.
“The supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood are extreme even for extremists,” said Noha Roushdy, one of the protesters.
Bundled in coats and hats against the snow and waving Egyptian flags, the crowd of about thirty chanted in Arabic and brandished signs with slogans such as “Do NOT Support the Dictator,” and “From Harvard to Tahrir Square: Power Grab is not Fair.”
Boston and Cambridge residents of Egyptian descent organized the protest, which—like the uprisings in Egypt itself—was coordinated primarily through social media.
Protesters shared information over a Facebook page called ‘Egyptians in Boston,’ which currently has close to 900 members. According to Mousad, the page has facilitated many similar events.
In addition to protesters’ indignation at what they called “tyrannical” acts by Morsi, those assembled expressed concern for the potential complications of the United States’ current support of the leader.
“We have one message to the United States government,” said Mousad. “Do not empower and enable oppressive regimes. We did that with the Taliban in Afghanistan during the Cold War to help us fight the Soviets. What did they do? They turned on us.”
The call for a shift in American policies towards Morsi’s presidency was a sentiment expressed throughout the protest.
“I would not like to see this nation supporting this dictator and making the same mistakes as the past,” said Tamer Elshayal, a student at the Graduate School of Design. “America is only hurting its reputation in the region by claiming to be pro-democracy while supporting tyranny.”
Protesters expressed concern that Morsi’s action could threaten the progress made during last year’s revolution.
“We just don’t want Morsi in power, deleting everything that the revolution has fought so hard for,” said Roushdy. “We do not want another Mubarak.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sheryl WuDunn called gender inequality “the greatest world challenge of our time” at Harvard China Care’s Seventh Annual Benefit Dinner and Silent Auction Saturday night.  The event, designed to raise money for orphans in China, featured humorous and thought-provoking speeches alike, as comedian Joe Wong and Eric I. Lu ’09, a founder of the Jubilee Project, followed WuDunn at the podium.
Comparing gender inequity to the issue of slavery in the nineteenth century and totalitarianism in the twentieth, WuDunn said that empowering women and girls is not only a moral obligation but also a practical solution to combating global poverty.
“In rural places in China... what it takes to get ahead in school is not your IQ—it’s what chromosomes you have,” she said, emphasizing equal treatment of young girls and boys as one way to erase the gender gap.
In addition to her work in journalism, WuDunn co-wrote “Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide” with former Crimson editor Nicholas D. Kristof ’82.
“Women are part of the solution, not the problem,” she said.
WuDunn ended her address with a call for continued volunteerism.
“Devote a little part of your life to helping out,” she told the audience.  “I hope that as you also look back at your life... you will not only look at the achievements that you’ve made in career and family and friends, but also at how you addressed the great inequities of the world.”
The comedian Joe Wong followed WuDunn at the podium and provided an entertaining interlude for the dinner guests. Like WuDunn, he addressed gender inequality—albeit in a more humorous light.
Referencing his wife’s greater income, he said, “in a few years, women will be making more than men...so I’m a pioneer.”
He also poked fun at the Harvard cheating scandal this year. “Apparently Harvard students are not good at everything,” he said.
The night ended with a video presentation by Eric I. Lu ’09, whose organization the Jubilee Project uses videos and social media to support various causes. Lu screened a draft of an unreleased video called “The Last Pick,” featuring Jeremy Lin encouraging a young boy to follow his basketball dreams.
“Videos can inspire and empower the next generation to achieve,” said Lu, who took a leave of absence from Harvard Medical School to help found the Jubilee Project.
He advised the audience to follow their passions as he had.
“Each one of us is made extraordinary by choosing to live a life true for ourselves,” he said. “Here in this room sits the next generation of people who are going to do extraordinary things—let’s do big things together.”
The event, which was first held seven years ago at the Harvard Faculty Club, now raises over twenty thousand dollars annually, according to Harvard China Care president Eden Liu ’13.  Since 2009, the organization has donated all proceeds to a special care unit for infant orphans at the China Care Home in Beijing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Divinity School Dean Ronald F. Thiemann, a noted scholar whose research focused on the application of theology and religion to other disciplines, died late last week. He was 66.
Thiemann gained acclaim throughout his academic career as an author and researcher, publishing books on the intersection of theology and religion with public life including “Religion in Public Life: A Dilemma for Democracy” and “Constructing a Public Theology: The Church in a Pluralistic Culture.”
Prior to his death he had completed a new book entitled “The Humble Sublime: Literary Realism as a Social Critique.”
The work highlights the connection between individuals such as Martin Luther, George Orwell, and Langston Hughes and the beliefs represented in their art and theology.
As a teacher, students remembered Thiemann as passionate, encouraging, and dedicated.
Michael A. Ball, a student in Thiemann’s seminar on the work of theologian Karl Barth, described the class as “a blessing.” For every class meeting, Thiemann invited all five students in the class to his home to engage in a dinner table discussion.
“It was an incredible experience to be invited into someone’s home and to be able to discuss something that was so clearly important to [Thiemann’s] world view,” Ball said.
Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, another Thiemman student, described his former teacher as “a very encouraging person.”
Thiemann’s teaching career began at the Department of Religious Studies at Yale University in 1975. He left Yale in 1978 to chair Haverford College’s religion department, a job he held until 1984.
In an email, former Haverford student Kenneth Koltun-Fromm described Thiemann as “a fantastic teacher and steady mentor.”
“He was a model for young students pursuing intellectual rigor with passion, integrity, and commitment,” he wrote.
Thiemann served as Divinity School Dean from 1986 to 1999, when he resigned citing a desire to focus on teaching.
His resignation came soon after a national controversy over pornographic downloads on his University-owned computer. He continued to teach at Harvard until his death.
Those who knew him well said that he will be remembered for his enthusiasm, which they said spread to every aspect of his life.
“It felt like we were a family and there was also a paternal love on his part for us,” Scarborough said. “In a lot of courses here at Harvard you get a lot of the head and not a lot of the heart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the Saturday afternoon contest that pitted the Harvard men’s basketball team against Fordham, three of the Crimson’s five starters had seen a combined 32 minutes on the court in their careers.
By the end of Harvard’s 73-64 win, that number had more than doubled to 70.
After an 85-78 loss to Vermont on Tuesday night, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker decided to forgo his usual starting lineup in favor of a much younger crew of starters. Rookies Mike Hall, Evan Cummins, and Agunwa Okolie earned their first career starts against the Rams, joining freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore Wesley Saunders—both of whom have started all six of Harvard’s games in 2012-13.
“We wanted to go with the best defensive team,” Amaker said. “We weren’t pleased with how we guarded our last game, so we went with a very young team but guys that were giving us a lot of energy on the defensive end. I thought they did a magnificent job for the few minutes that they were in there.”
The trio saw just under four minutes of action before junior co-captain Laurent Rivard and sophomores Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi entered the game to complete the Crimson’s usual starting lineup.
Okolie—who went on to play a total of 27 minutes in the contest—in particular had a breakout performance, notching a career-high 11 points and seven rebounds on three-of-five shooting from the field. The freshman also converted five-of-six free throws.
“You can see [Okolie’s] level of confidence and composure growing,” Amaker said. “He’s a young guy and starting, and all of the sudden he’s out there. I thought he did a tremendous job for us, and I told him that in the locker room.”
Harvard’s bench—led on Saturday by sophomore Jonah Travis and Rivard—contributed 32 points to Harvard’s total, including 20 points in the first half, as 11 players saw the court in the win over Fordham.
JONAH OF ARC
With 11:23 to play in the first half, Harvard trailed the Rams, 21-10. But just 6:17 later—after an impressive 19-2 run—the Crimson was back on top, 29-23. Travis led the charge during this period, scoring four layups and all 12 of his first-half points. The sophomore added four rebounds during that time as well, two on offense and two on defense.
“I was very impressed with Jonah Travis’ minutes, and what he gave us,” Amaker said. “I thought he gave us what Jonah’s been in the past. I’m so happy to see him get back to that, to being a blue collar, lunch pail kind of guy. He was really tough for us when we needed that.”
Travis paced his team with 12 rebounds on the night—including four offensive boards—on the way to his first double-double of the young season. On the game, Travis shot five for seven from the field and added six more points on nine trips to the line to finish the game with 16 points—second only to Saunders’ 17.
After Saturday’s contest, Travis is averaging 9.1 points per game, fourth on the Crimson, and a team-high six rebounds per game.
HARD IN THE PAINT
Although the Crimson was eventually able to pull out the win, Harvard’s defense—which gave up its highest points total since 2010 against Vermont on Tuesday—struggled in the paint for a portion of Saturday’s contest.
Despite claiming a slight 40-38 edge in rebounds, the Crimson allowed Fordham to pull down 19 offensive boards and earn 26 points on second-chance shots on the night.
“We just weren’t boxing out and finding guys sometimes,” Travis said. “That was problematic, but we stopped and said, ‘This is what we need to do,’ and I think we did a lot better job.”
The Rams scored 42 points from inside, while Harvard netted just 26 from close range.
In the end, free throw shooting may have been Fordham’s undoing. Although the Rams scored more than the Crimson down low, Harvard tallied 39 trips to the line in the contest and was able to capitalize on Fordham’s 29 fouls.
The Crimson shot 74 percent from the free-throw line, good for 29 points, while the Rams earned eight points at the charity stripe on just 14 attempts.
“Fordham is a really good team,” Travis said. “We knew we would have to be together, play defense, and come out at a whole new level if we wanted to pull this W out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team took on tough national competition at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational on Friday and Saturday. Co-captain Steven Keith once again led the way for the Crimson, finishing the weekend in fifth place for his weight class.
Harvard ended the tournament in 24th place out of 32 participating teams.
Keith has reached the podium in all three tournaments this year, having captured fifth-place and third-place finishes earlier this season to secure a No. 15 individual national ranking.
Wrestling at 141 pounds, Keith entered the tournament seeded sixth. After winning his first match, 5-0, Keith fell to third-seeded Tyler Graff of Wisconsin, who shut him down en route to a 9-3 win.
In the wrestlebacks, Keith won two matches in decisive fashion, not surrendering a single point. The senior then suffered a 9-2 defeat to Cornell junior Michael Nevinger, who would eventually claim fourth place.
But Keith finished the tournament on a strong note and took home an 8-6 victory in a closely contested fifth-place match.
“I thought I wrestled pretty well,” Keith said. “Just like the rest of the team, I have a few things that I need to work on, and if I can fix a few things, then I think I’ll be pretty happy with my results come the end of the year.”
Crimson coach Jay Weiss shares Keith’s focus on the long run, as both believe that the season cannot be judged until the NCAA tournament in March.
“It was good that [Keith] saw some of the guys that he saw,” Weiss said. “For us, when you wrestle somebody, win or lose, you’re going to have to beat them at the end of the year.”
Keith’s three victories vaulted him into 10th place on the all-time Crimson wins list with 89 total.
One of Harvard’s top performers early this season has been freshman Jeff Ott, who went 2-2 on the weekend but failed to reach the podium for the first time in his short collegiate career.
Scoring came easy for Ott, who wrestles at 125 pounds, in his first two matches, as he tallied a combined 24 points to start the tournament. But the rookie fell in a lopsided, 15-5 contest to Ohio State senior Nikko Triggas, who had already racked up two falls in his first two matches.
Ott could not recover in the wrestlebacks, and his tournament ended with a 6-3 loss in his next match.
“[Ott] wrestled tough,” Weiss said. “Every time he goes out there he gets better and better, which is really cool to see as a freshman. He doesn’t really wrestle with too much fear, and I think the rest of the team can kind of feed off that, which is pretty neat for a freshman to do.”
Harvard’s next top performer on the mat was junior Cameron Croy, who went 2-2 on the weekend at 174 pounds. Croy’s first loss came to Nebraska sophomore Robert Kokesh, who went on to a first-place finish in the weight class.
The tournament hosted some of the best teams in the nation, as 11 of the field’s participating teams earned spots in the top 25.
Such tough competition has been typical of the Crimson’s early-season tournaments, and the pattern will continue when Harvard participates in the Midlands Championships in Illinois at the end of December.
Harvard missed the presence of some of its top wrestlers, including co-captain Walter Peppelman, who has posted two consecutive eighth-place finishes in the NCAA tournament. Sophomore James Fox, who was ranked 20th in his weight class at the beginning of the season, also missed the competition.
Although Weiss has observed progress in his team’s overall performance in the opening month of the season, he nevertheless is eager to see what his squad can do at full strength.
“It’s frustrating because we literally have four starters out of the lineup,” Weiss said. “I know how good we can be with those guys in the lineup…. I think [our success] hinges on getting our guys healthy.”
While Harvard’s top lineup has not yet been able to take to the mat, the trip to Las Vegas provided the team with another chance to assess itself at the start of nearly a month-long break before its next tournament.
“It’s still early in the season, so we can get a feel for where we’re at and where we need to go,” Weiss said. “I think our team’s better; I feel a lot of confidence in my guys. So I think we can do better, and we will do better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams travelled to Poughkeepsie, N.Y. to take on five opponents on Saturday, both teams bringing home four decisive victories.
The tournament was hosted by Vassar and brought together co-ed teams from Penn State, UNC, NYU, Sacred Heart, and Vassar.
In their first dual action of the season, the men and women both fell to the Nittany Lions, 16-11 and 17-10, respectively. The Penn State men’s team went undefeated and the women’s team lost to Princeton.
“I thought we had a really good showing,” said junior co-captain and foil Alexandra Kiefer. “We’ve been working hard, and obviously [Penn State is] a really strong team.”
The Nittany Lions were led by the performances of two Olympic foilists. Senior Daniel Gomez-Tanamachi represented Mexico in London and made it to the round of 16, losing to China’s Jianfei Ma.
Senior Miles Chamley-Watson lost to Egypt’s Alaaeldin Abouelkassem in the round of 32.
“Penn State’s Olympians pretty much guaranteed three wins for them,” said freshman sabre fencer Duncan O’Brien. “At St John’s we will have a much stronger showing and hopefully be able to beat them.”
Both Crimson teams topped Penn State last year, and the squads will face the Nittany Lions again on Jan. 26. Despite the losses, the fencers were pleased with their showing against Penn State.
“It was closer than I thought it was going to be,” Kiefer said. “They are a very deep team, and they have three solid fencers in every single position.”
On the men’s side, junior co-captain and epee Michael Raynis stood out, going 13-1.
He was backed up by a strong performance from O’Brien, who went 7-1 in his first NCAA competition.
“[O’Brien had an] amazing performance, very high spirited, very competitive,” Crimson coach Peter Brand. “He performed way beyond my expectations. It bodes really well for us and for him this year.”
Both teams started the morning with back-to-back victories against Sacred Heart and Vassar.
“This was the first meet of the season, so I think mentally everyone was very well prepared for it,” Kiefer said. “We went into it with a good mindset, and we didn’t underestimate any of the teams. We fenced strongly in every single bout.”
After its loss against Penn State in the third round, Harvard rebounded to take the next two. Despite soundly defeating UNC, O’Brien described it as the closest victory of the day.
“Besides Penn State, UNC was the second big one,” O’Brien said. “It was pretty close, but we pulled it out.”
Harvard ended the day with wins over NYU.
The women’s team was led by Kiefer and freshman epee fencer Nina van Loon, who posted identical 14-1 records.
“On the women’s side we have some very good players, we just don’t have as much depth as the men overall,” Brand said. “But they are very competitive and very spirited.”
The Crimson was able to overcome its lack of depth when senior Alexa Fishman—an epee fencer—competed as a foilist.
“She performed really well,” Kiefer said. “We were really proud of her. She definitely performed better than I think she was expecting.”
Harvard also competed without junior sabre fencer Eric Arzoian, who placed sixth at the Garrett Penn State open at the beginning of November but was forced to sit out this weekend with a wrist injury.
In preparation for January’s meet, the teams will look to build on their strong performances from Saturday.
“I feel good about the rest of the season,” Kiefer said. “We can definitely keep working on our conditioning in terms of getting stronger. I think we can work a little bit more on strategy, but overall I think we are poised to continue doing well.”
The Crimson is confident about its ability to be competitive at Ivy League Championships in early February, especially on the men’s side.
“We are just much deeper overall [on the men’s side] in all three events: sabre, foil, and epee,” Brand said. “In every one of these events we have three or four really good guys, so that really bodes well just because this is what determines who is going to win at the end of the year.”
Brand said that he was happy with the 4-1 result, but that the team needs to continue to improve before its next competition.
“We really have to become much more aggressive overall because our next match is in January against the top schools in the nation in New York,” Brand said. “That’s really going to give us a better indicator of where we stand overall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final meet of 2012, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team faced its stiffest test of the season so far.
After three straight dual meet wins against Ivy League opponents, the Crimson travelled to the University of Georgia Invitational to take on some of the best collegiate teams in the country.  The eight-team field featured six squads ranked in the top 20 nationally.
“Our mentality was to take advantage of this opportunity to compete against some of the best teams in the country and see where we stack up,” co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “We wanted to challenge ourselves and expose ourselves to the best that the country has to offer.”
Strong performances across the board led Harvard to a sixth-place finish with a 311 point total.
Two-time defending national champion UC Berkeley ran away with the event as the Bears racked up 856 points over the weekend. Virginia finished second with 702 points, followed by host Georgia, which tallied 662.5 points.
The Crimson contingent was led by the strong individual performance of sophomore Chuck Katis, who set two program records and earned NCAA ‘A’ standards in both the 100m and 200m breast stroke—immediately qualifying him for NCAA championships in both events.
Katis set a new Harvard school record in his preliminary swim for the 100, only to better his time in the finals en route to a first-place finish.
The next day, Katis beat out all of his competitors in the 200 final. His mark of 1:54.08 was the second-best time in the country this season.
“I basically set out this season with that goal in mind, to get the ‘A’ cuts early,” Katis said. “I think I accomplished what I was looking to get out of the weekend.”
Katis also set a personal record on the first day of competition in the 200 individual medley with a time of 1:45.86.
Katis’ performance anchored a strong weekend of swims from many of the team members.
“Across the board, guys are swimming their best times in season,” Wurzbacher said. “We’ve had guys placing in finals every night. Both Chuck’s performance as an individual and across the team, our performance has been really, really strong.”
Also competing in the 200 breast, sophomore Matthew Karle came in 20th with a time of 2:03.96, less than a second off his personal best. Junior Jason Ting finished just behind in 22nd with a time of 2:05.64.
The Crimson also had three swimmers place in the top 20 in the 100 free. Junior Chris Satterthwaite swam in a time of 44.30, good for sixth place. Sophomore Griffin Schumacher finished in 11th, and junior Oliver Lee took 12th. Sophomore Zach Walters, the fourth Harvard swimmer in the event, came in 21st.
In the 400 free relay, the Crimson took third place, as Katis, Satterthwaite, Schumacher, and Lee combined for a time of 2:55.45 in the event.
Coming off wins in both events in the last two meets, sophomore Michael Mosca turned in another strong diving performance. Mosca took third in the 1-meter finals and fourth in the 3-meter event.
In the 200-yard butterfly, Harvard had three swimmers place in the top 20. Freshman Leo Lim led the Crimson swimmers with a time of 1:48.47, good for seventh place. Freshman Yousef Alaskari came in 12th, while fellow first-year Jacob Luna finished just one spot behind.
“We realize we are capable against some of the very fast teams,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “It gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. We swam some very fast times for this point in the season.”
The invitational, which pitted the Crimson against some of the toughest teams in the nation, served as an im-portant benchmark as the team prepares for the second half of its season.
“This is a national breaking point in the season; [it] marks the halfway point,” Wurzbacher said. “We’re in a great place, from a performance standpoint, but there are a lot of things we can do to build into the back half of the season.”
Having finished its 2012 competitions, Harvard will return in January with renewed focus on the Ivy League and building towards the conference championships.
“[We can] really come together as a unit, and as a team, to do what we hope to do at the end of the season, which is win the Ivy League championships,” Wurzbacher added. “I’m a senior, and we’ve been second to Princeton three years in a row. But we’re incredibly confident after this weekend that we can do what it takes to win the Ivy League championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three decisive victories over Ivy League foes to start off the season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team headed south for its first real test in Georgia.
The squad split up for the weekend, with half going to Athens for the UGA Fall Invite and the others traveling just 70 miles away to Atlanta for the Georgia Tech Invitational. Despite snapping its undefeated record with losses at both meets, the Crimson held its own against some of the fastest in the nation.
The Crimson posted sixth-place showings at both meets, racking up 265 points at the UGA Fall Invite and 418 points at Georgia Tech, while winners Georgia and Florida State tallied 991 and 2056 points, respectively.
“We knew going into the [UGA] meet that we were going to be underdogs, but we just wanted to make our presence known, and I think we definitely did that,” freshman Kendall Crawford said. “Another coach actually told our coach, ‘Wow, y’all are swimming a lot faster than last year.’”
At the UGA Fall Invite, Harvard faced off against UC Berkeley, the 2012 NCAA champion, Penn State, SEC opponents UGA and Auburn, and ACC teams Virginia and Virginia Tech.
“The teams we went against were in the SEC and the Big Ten, all these really big conferences that we usually don’t get to compete against,” co-captain Brittany Powell said. “It was exciting to get to see swimmers and divers from outside of the Ivy League, and they tend to be a bit more competitive than us.”
Continuing its streak of breaking records, Harvard returned from Georgia with seven new school records, with marks being broken multiple times over the weekend by Crimson teammates.
Harvard’s freshman speed was exemplified when Danielle Lee broke Crawford’s record of 54.99 in the 100-yard backstroke preliminary race by posting a time of 54.93. Crawford then snatched back her title in her own prelim race by pacing the race in 54.59 before breaking it again in the final race, where she made the ‘B’ cut with a time of 54.00.
“Our incoming freshmen are actually incredible,” Powell said. “They’re such an amazing recruiting class, so it’s just a really exciting time for Harvard swimming because we’re gaining a lot of attention from the top recruits. I know Kendall was competitive, choosing between Stanford and Harvard, [so] we’re so lucky to have her.”
Crawford was also a part of three other new records in addition to her retained 100-yard backstroke record: the 50-yard backstroke split, and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays.
“It’s been surreal,” Crawford said. “As a team, we broke so many records, we were counting them in the car on the way to the airport. It’s been so much fun. It’s great to have a goal to have going into the relay—it’s like ‘Alright, let’s break the team record, we can do it.’ To make your mark at Harvard is really cool.”
Sophomore Ana Anaya joined in on the record breaking, taking an individual record in the 100-yard fly with a time of 53.98. Anaya made the ‘A’ cut, and joined in the medley relay records as well, swimming the butterfly leg of the race. Also a part of the medley records were senior Mackenzie Luick, swimming the breaststroke leg, and junior co-captain Sara Li, who took the freestyle portion of the race. Li crushed a four-year-old Harvard record in the 100-free with a blistering time of 49.77.
“It’s not normal,” Li said. “We calculated it, and we broke 17 records this weekend, which is kind of ridiculous. We’re not even at the end of our season, so it’s exciting to see the potential that we have coming up and to have confidence that we’re going really fast. It’s a great feeling to know that the team that we have is the fastest team that we’ve had at the history of Harvard, and we’re ready to see what we can do.”
On the diving side, junior Alex Stanton and Powell made the 1-meter diving finals on the second day of competition, with Stanton taking 13th and Powell coming in at 16th. Three Crimson divers made the 3-meter diving finals, where Stanton was the top Crimson diver, placing 10th.
Though the elite competition ultimately proved too tall for a Harvard team that put together a record-breaking weekend, Li acknowledges the value of the experience.
“This is literally the fastest meet in the country, so we were up against national champions,” Li said. “There were several Olympians on pool deck…so it was awesome that we made a statement. It’s pretty cool and inspiring to watch these girls swim and know that we can hold our own against them and we take that confidence back to the Ivy League, where we’re ready to dominate.”
At the Georgia Tech meet, junior Deidre Clute placed fourth in the ‘A’ final of the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 2:02.22, while senior Ellie Johnson topped the ‘B’ final in the 50-yard freestyle.

Chuck Katis pulled out our Athlete of the Week honors with his breaststroke endeavors at the Georgia Invitational this weekend, but several other Crimson athletes also turned in sterling performances this week. Your Athlete of the Week runners-up are…
VICTORIA LIPPERT, Women’s basketball
Lippert commanded the Harvard offense in back-to-back 21 point performances.  The Lowell senior led the Crimson to a 63-44 win over New Hampshire on Friday before scoring six points in extra time for a 70-67 OT edging of Hofstra. Lippert now has thirteen career 20-plus point performances.
WES SAUNDERS and JONAH TRAVIS, Men’s basketball
Saunders found his way to the line in Harvard’s 73-64 win over Fordham. The 6'5'' sophomore sunk 13-of-18 free throws to lead the Crimson with 17 points. Classmate Jonah Travis grabbed 12 rebounds and recorded 16 points of his own to record his second collegiate double-double.
LAURA BELLAMY and friends, Women’s hockey
Bellamy and her fellow net-minders did not have to dig the puck out of the net once this weekend, as the ECAC’s stingiest defense shut down its opponents. Bellamy stopped 26 shots in a 6-0 rout of Dartmouth on Friday. On Saturday, the Harvard defense left little work for freshmen goalies Emerance Maschmeyer (who shared AOTW honors with Bellamy in November) and Molly Tissenbaum. The net-minding duo had to stop only 11 shots in a 4-0 shutout of the Russian national team. The Crimson has allowed only six goals in nine games this season and leads the ECAC in goals against average.

After leading the most prolific offense in the history of the Ivy League, Harvard senior quarterback Colton Chapple has won the conference’s highest honor.
In a Monday afternoon presentation at the Vanderbilt Room of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, Chapple was awarded the Asa S. Bushnell Cup as the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year.
The quarterback becomes the third straight Crimson standout in as many years to win the cup, after defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11 won the defensive edition of the honor last season and running back Gino Gordon ’11 earned the award in 2010.
The senior was named one of two finalists for the cup last week, along with Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews, who last season became the first sophomore to win player of the year honors.
But in 2012, it was Chapple who took home the trophy following a season in which he finished second in the nation in passing efficiency, behind only Stony Brook’s Kyle Essington.
The quarterback threw a program-record 24 touchdown passes—surpassing the previous high of 18—and accounted for 3,169 yards of total offense, also the most in Crimson history. That number includes Chapple’s 602 rushing yards—the fifth-most of any player in the conference—and he also collected nine touchdowns on the ground.
Over the course of his Crimson career—in which the 2012 season was his first as the full-time starter—Chapple threw at least four touchdown passes five times; no quarterback in Crimson history had done that more than twice.
This year, he led an offense that was fourth in the country with over 487 yards per game and that scored 394 points, the most of any Ivy League squad since the conference formed in 1956.
Chapple was previously named the New England Player of the Year and first-team All-Ivy League while winning the Frederick Greeley Crocker Award as the program’s most valuable player.
He becomes the seventh Harvard player to win the Bushnell Cup, following quarterback Jim Stoeckel (1973), wide receiver Carl Morris (2001, 2002), quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (2004), quarterback Chris Pizzotti (2008), Gordon (2010), and Ortiz (2011). The honor has been awarded annually since 1970 and began recognizing both an offensive and a defensive player in 2011.
Princeton defensive tackle Mike Catapano, who led the conference with 12 sacks, won the Bushnell Cup on the defensive side.

According to an op-ed penned by University Professor Robert C. Darnton '60, director of the Harvard University Library, there is a widespread belief in China that the walls of Harvard libraries are graced by 20 allocutions which express an expectation that Harvard students constantly grind away at studies.
"Millions and millions of Chinese have heard of these supposed 20 allocutions," Darton said, later estimating that the misconception has been building for at least a decade.
Some students who have approached him have memorized some of the allocutions, telling him that they had heard of them since kindergarten, he said.
 Allocution #1, he writes in the op-ed, reads: "Nodding at the moment, you will dream. While studying at the moment, you will come true."
Others read: "Even now, opponents also kept banging on the page," and "Please enjoy the unavoidable suffering."
These aphorisms have gone viral through forums such as schools, newspapers, a best-selling book, and a blog with 87 million hits.
Blogs about the allocutions are even more bizarre than the allocutions themselves. Darton wrote how one portrays Harvard lunch as an occasion where "students toss their coats on the floor and consume pizza without looking up from their books or exchanging any talk" while another illustrates Harvard working conditions as "grand and imposing, although...women refuse to wear makeup and the men disdain fine clothes. [Allocutions] are scribbled on desks and contain messages such as: 'If you study one more hour, you will have a better husband.'"
Questions about the sayings are the most common query received via the "Ask a Librarian" section of the Harvard Library portal. After setting the record straight, Harvard librarians often receive touching replies, explained Darnton, listing some:
"Are u kidding? We grown up with those mottos." "Thank you for liberating us." "When I knew the truth I can't stop crying."
"People seem to be relieved that Harvard students are not these spartan workaholics...and that they're just ordinary mortals," Darnton said.

Looking for a Christmas/Hanukkah/holiday present for your family or friends? We've found gifts for under $25 from a variety of stores around the Square.
Harvard Square's Holiday Craft Fair
Located at the First Parish Unitarian Church right across the street from Johnston Gate, the annual Craft Fair sells everything from thick hand-knit sweaters to handcrafted wooden kitchen utensils to t-shirts emblazoned with puns. Don't be fooled by the three stands set up outside—if you go downstairs, the whole basement is devoted to different booths of crafts. While many are on the more expensive side, there are definitely good deals to be found. A few of note are from a booth set up outside: earrings made from recycled aluminum from computer parts ($10) and others from recycled glass from windows ($8). Downstairs, you'll find a booth devoted to hand crafted and painted mugs ($20) and another filled with homemade bath fizzies, lip balms, and body oils (all 5 for $25).
The fair will be open December 8-9, 14-16, and 18-23.
Black Ink
The slogan for Black Ink, located in the center of Harvard Square, is "unexpected necessities," and the huge range of potential gifts in this store live up to that. Banagrams ($16.95), a board game without a board that consists of Scrabble tiles in a banana shaped bag, is the perfect gift for children and adults alike. One shelf over, you'll find a Half Pint Garden ($15.50), a cute little carton with basil, mint, and thyme seeds and soil pellets—the perfect gift for someone who likes cooking and wants to grow herbs. In the tubs in the middle of the store, there are tiny books ("The Constellation Finder," "The Animal Track Finder," and the "Flower Finder") all $4.95 for the hiker and nature aficionado in your life. One added bonus about Black Ink is the range of wrapping papers that are available to wrap your gift. Some have maps, others intricate floral prints or diagrams of the Eiffel Tower—the perfectly unique wrapping for the quirky gift that's inside.
Cardullo's Gourmet Shoppe
Right next to Black Ink is Cardullo's, a deli that also doubles as a store for delicious and unique foods, perfect gifts for any the foodie. Cute and old-fashioned looking tins of Chai, Mighty Hot Chocolate, and Mint Hot Chocolate ($10.95) are the perfect gift to enjoy on a cold winter day. On the next shelf over are Tea Brewing Systems ($13.99), intricate and beautifully decorated tea pots into which you can put tea leaves to steep in boiling water. Cardullo's collection of unique and adventurous chocolate bars ($4.49) with flavors such as Coffee Crunch, Chilies and Cherries, and Almonds and Sea Salt make the perfect gift for anyone who enjoys sweets.
Raven Used Books
Awarded the "Best of the New Award" from the Boston Globe when it first opened in 2010, this used book store a little bit out of the center of the Square down JFK St. sells its wares at 50 to 80 percent of their original cover prices. Because, according to its website, the store purchases over 1100 books a week from professors, students, and families, there's a constant stream of new books that provides steady variety. The books you'll find here are more academic than the ones from your regular book store (many of them are published from University presses).
And then there are the standard go-to's: Newbury Comics for your teenage brother, the Urban Outfitters Bargain Basement for your sister, Lush for your mom or aunt, or a gift card to Teavana or the Crema Café for your roommate.
