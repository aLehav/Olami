After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard held its inaugural First-Gen/Next Gen Graduation Ceremony on May 23, a special commencement celebration honoring the achievements of graduating students across the University who are first generation, low income, undocumented, DACA or TPS recipients, or mixed-status.
Attended by more than 100 graduating students, the ceremony was jointly hosted by the Office for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging and the Next Gen Initiative, which aims to improve existing resources for FGLI students across Harvard’s 12 schools.
Amanda K. Sharick, project lead for the Next-Gen Initiative, said that while students value Harvard’s general commencement, there is “something more” to a commencement celebration around the shared identity of being FGLI.
“It’s the most beautiful thing to be affirmed by someone who understands,” Sharick said. “That’s the reason why a separate space is needed — to affirm, to acknowledge, and to celebrate in community.”
Per Sharick, students across the University ordered more than 400 First-Gen/Next Gen stoles, created by Graduate School of Design student Dianne Le.
Sherri A. Charleston — the University’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer — offered a welcome address to the virtual crowd, in which she called on students to continue to be leaders once they graduate from Harvard.
“Remember what you chose to do here leaves with you and it goes beyond this great institution into the world,” Charleston said. “And it will ripple backwards throughout future generations of Harvard students.”
Physics and Chemical Engineering professor Vinothan N. Manoharan, faculty advisor for the Next Gen Initiative, congratulated graduating students and said they represent the “next generation” of scholars, organizers, and inventors.
Several FGLI graduating students across various schools of the University also spoke about their experiences during the ceremony.
Nathan J. Nakatsuka ’12, an M.D.-Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School, said what he has appreciated most about studying at Harvard over the past 12 years is the “incredible diversity” of University affiliates.
“I’ve had many incredible conversations with many people from really different backgrounds and really different worldviews and definitely learned as much from my classmates as from my classes, if not more,” Nakatsuka said.
Emily Romero Gonzalez ’21 — a former co-director of the student-run immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream — said although she has faced a number of obstacles during her time in the College as a FGLI student and DACA recipient, she is “filled with pride” in these communities at Harvard.
“Harvard was never built for students like us,” Gonzalez said. “Throughout my four years here, I grappled with the reality of Harvard’s exclusionary history and the lack of resources for my many communities. But despite this, we have never failed to advocate for what we deserve, even during the hardest of times.”
Graduate School of Design graduate Charmie Kapoor said in an interview following the event that the ceremony felt like a “haven” for FGLI students to share personal stories about their experiences at Harvard.
“I could connect to some of the stories. Some of them had similar ethnic backgrounds, some of them had similar family or financial backgrounds,” Kapoor said. “It just felt like a closer group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My time on Harvard Women’s Rugby could be a page out of a fairytale. I walked onto the team my sophomore fall, and we won Ivy Championships in both 15s and 7s, only to come back my junior fall to win a national championship. I never thought Sunday, Nov. 17, 2019, the day we won the NIRA National Championship game, would be the highest point of my athletic career and also my last competition for the Crimson. As of June 1, it’s been 562 days since we last competed. But I’ve felt the strength and lessons of my team more so in the last 562 days off the field than I could have imagined. Harvard Women’s Rugby, more than anything else at Harvard, taught me how to learn, how to be a teammate, and how to be brave.
Harvard students are rarely given the chance to be bad at something. We step into this university at the top of our fields already, and anything less than perfection is uncharacteristic. My time with rugby has been intentionally imperfect. I walked onto the team having never even seen a game of rugby before, but I was thrown right into a game against our biggest rivals just weeks later. Ask my teammates — I looked very much like a lost chicken on the run. But my team chose to coach, not criticize. It was a long process of constant questions, being knocked down (literally), rules I still don’t understand, and undying faith by my teammates that made me the confident player I am now. Not many people would take the time to support, teach, and cheer on a peer in both the good and the bad, but Harvard Women’s Rugby has always believed that anyone should be able to play rugby. We have grown into a championship team because of our commitment to the value and growth of every player on the roster, no matter how lost they are. From this team and process, I have learned true patience, humility, and kindness.
Being a teammate used to be clearly defined by actions of support we could express every day. It was about offering a hand up after a tackle, laughing on the walk across the bridge, and giving your teammate the last cookie at Dunster team dinners. This past year, those actions shifted to Zoom DMs during team meetings, phone calls over so many time zones, and emailed letters of appreciation to each other. Being an unwaveringly supportive and selfless teammate is your first and most important job on this team, and every person took that on with new strength this year. My teammates showed up for each others’ thesis presentations, CEB events, and Zoom yoga sessions without fail. I’m at a complete loss to explain how every day on this team has pushed me to be a stronger and kinder teammate, friend, and person.
One of my teammates recently interviewed a bunch of Harvard Rugby players and alumni about the wisdom they’ve gained from rugby, and we all repeated, “pressure is a privilege.” All student-athletes know that sometimes the weight of expectations, whether they be athletic, academic, personal, or all of the above, can be paralyzing. Even more paralyzing than the expectations, though, is when we cannot predict the outcomes. Bravery is defined as facing fear, hardship, and uncertainty and forging on anyway. Harvard Women’s Rugby made me brave because it taught me to face fear and uncertainty and choose to be grateful to get to feel so much. Every Friday, whether it be on our locker room whiteboard or in our team group chat, everyone had to write something they were grateful for no matter how small. Through this past year, our team has anchored itself in being grateful for the teammates, safety, and love we have, bravely facing each hurdle together.
Harvard Women’s Rugby nurtured, pushed, supported, and loved me unconditionally. This team is built on generations of love, of grit, of sacrifice, and of passion, and I know that will never leave me. It has given me strength and confidence I didn’t know I was capable of, and a family I never knew I needed. Thank you, millions of times over, to Harvard Women’s Rugby and Harvard Athletics for giving me the education of a lifetime.
