After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Federal Reserve approved a host of new regulations intended to eliminate the unfair practice of unannounced debit and ATM card overcharge fees. This decision, slated to take effect next summer, is a long overdue measure that will undoubtedly protect customers—many of whom are college students—who would be otherwise unaware of fine-print loan policies.
The status quo represented a certain exploitation of which many card customers were unaware. Customers were often charged lofty fees they would certainly not have agreed to if they understood them.
Under the Fed’s new regulations, companies must now make debit-card policies—especially fees—explicitly clear through frequent notices to customers, without whose permission overdraft charges can no longer be issued. While these notices have yet to circulate, they are thankfully required to be lucid, clear, and forthcoming with the full extent of policies regarding fees. We hope that these new measures will have their desired effect and reduce the exploitation so common under previous card-company policies.
The new system requires banks to clearly explain overdraft charges to their consumers, and it also requires permission to offer the service in the first place. Requiring permission will make the customer a more active participant in the process of acquiring and, yes, understanding the use of a debit card—an essential step in liberating huge numbers of Americans from the confusion that has all too often translated into customer abuse.
But perhaps the best thing about the Fed’s new mandate is that it increases choice for consumers, not to mention ensuring that customers will actually want the supposed “services” they will receive from their card companies. A better understanding of the nuances and implications of each respective card policy will create a more financially-literate pool of customers much more aware of the decisions they make and the impact of those decisions. In that sense, while the Fed has at once protected customers nationwide from continued abuse, it has also done much to educate these customers about their financial health and well-being, an essential step in cultivating the kind of citizens upon which this administration relies.
Above all else, bringing transparency to financial products appears to be a high priority for the current administration, and this is an important step in the right direction. We appreciate the Fed’s committment to both protect and educate customers.

Without fail, it seems, Americans are invited to experience the end of the world as we know it on the silver screen every year. This year is no exception—the highly touted apocalyptic vision “2012,” hitting theaters soon, puts a Mesoamerican twist on the conventional doomsday script. Yet though “2012” promises little in the way of a groundbreaking storyline, it promises nevertheless to be a box office hit—for, like all disaster movies, it portrays some of our culture’s most pressing philosophical concerns through its apocalyptic visions flashing onscreen.
Revolving around the date of Dec. 21, 2012, the supposed end of the Mayan calendar, “2012” shows few signs of being any different from any of the other disaster films to have graced the cinema marquee in the past half decade or so. The trailer is almost archetypal: towering oceanic waves flatten West Coast metropolises, impossibly schismatic earthquakes swallow vehicles in urban centers, and all of humanity resorts to quasi-primal instincts while still maintaining a sense of decency and hope in times of bleak despair. We all know how this ends, of course: Mankind survives another day—at least until next year’s version of essentially the same catastrophic event—and the humbled survivors ultimately learn something about themselves, each other, and the prevailing strength of the human will.
Yet despite the repetitiveness of these films, Americans can’t seem to get enough. M. Night Shyamalan’s disastrously received film “The Happening” has made over $100 million in profit since its release, and green-messaged “The Day After Tomorrow” made over $500 million worldwide. Perhaps we need to witness the earth being torn apart by natural forces beyond our control to realize that at least the real world isn’t really that bad. Or maybe we’re all just victims of the brilliant advertising campaigns these producers launch to delude viewers into believing their new apocalyptic blockbluster is somehow different than the one we all saw two years ago.
But, as an admitted sucker for these sorts of movies, I choose to believe that Americans devour them year after year because they continue to capture our imaginations in the same way a skilled raconteur could millennia ago. Doomsday prophecies are a part of nearly every society on the globe; whether they involve Mayan calendars, judgment days, or doctors named Strangelove, people love to speculate about how such a complex and diverse ecosystem as Earth could suddenly succumb to the powers that be.
Musing over the prospect of a doomsday forces us to consider the possible parameters of such an event. Would we want to know the exact date, or live in blissful ignorance until the day of reckoning? If the former, how would we prioritize our lives accordingly? If we survive the catastrophe, what would we do with our lives? And would we want to survive it anyway?
Through the reactions and decisions of the flavorless main characters that provide the human gravitas to these films, the possibilities juggled in our minds can be explored on screen. We can escape into a hypothetical reality fraught with morally-ambiguous dilemmas and can decide along the way how we would behave in any given situation. And with the rapid advancement of CGI in film, the effects on screen take on new levels of destructive pleasure every year.
“2012” opened last weekend and saw its profits go into the black instantly with a worldwide gross of $225 million. The movie probably fell far short of anyone’s expectation of a quality film—but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that it, like its predecessors, allows audiences to escape into their own minds and ponder some of the biggest questions ever asked. And for that reason, it will surely continue to fill entire theatres with the same suckers who succumb to these movies every single year.

Five years ago, alleged electoral fraud and a suspicious poisoning attempt on presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko brought hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian protesters out onto the streets of Kyiv. In the aftermath of what came to be called the Orange Revolution and Yushchenko’s rise to the presidency, it seemed as though Ukraine was on a track that would eventually allow it to catch up with its neighbors to the west. Although it is lagging behind former communist states to its west like Poland and the Czech Republic, Ukraine is still better off, relative to most of the former Soviet republics. According to Freedom House’s annual ranking, it is the freest of these states, excluding the Baltic countries, and its close ties with Europe suggest that it has the potential to someday join NATO and even the EU.
Now though, with the first presidential election since the Orange Revolution approaching, Ukraine seems to be in danger of losing the tenuous progress it has made since it broke off from the Soviet Union 18 years ago. The country’s economy was devastated by the recession and the partnership between Yushchenko and Yulia Timoshenko, his prime minister, is now riven by feuding and electoral politics. Especially in light of recent Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian politics, the international community needs to make an effort to show support for maintaining democratic government in Ukraine and to demonstrate its commitment to protect Ukraine from foreign intervention.
When Ukrainians go to the polls this January, they will be choosing between Yushchenko, his prime minister and former partner, Yulia Tymoshenko, and Viktor Yanukovych, Yushchenko’s rival in the last election, along with 15 others. The lack of clarity on how much power the president can actually exercise has been cited as a major factor in the split between Yuschenko and Timoshenko. Whether Ukraine elects a leader who will try to move in a more authoritarian direction or one who is more willing to work with the prime minister and parliament will undoubtedly be a major factor in the direction Ukrainian democracy will move in.
The election is also likely to have significant bearing on Ukraine’s relations with its neighbors. In the last Ukrainian election, Moscow declared its support for Yanukovich, who has taken a distinctly more pro-Russian stance than the current president. And although Russia has not publicly supported any of the candidates this time around, it has made moves in the past few months that seem calculated to influence the outcome of the election. In August, President Dmitry Medvedev sent a letter to Yushchenko criticizing him for his pro-Western stance, and declaring that Russia will not send an ambassador to Ukraine until the government revises its policies toward Russia— or until a government more friendly toward Russia comes to power.
While Ukrainian voters—many of whom are still anti-Russian—are unlikely to be swayed by Moscow’s political angling, the Kremlin’s clear interest in the outcome of the election suggests a worrying desire to interfere more directly in Ukrainian affairs. Since Russia’s war with Georgia in August of last year, some analysts have raised concerns that Russia would try to intervene militarily in Ukraine as well. Russia has recently shown concern for the large Russian population in the eastern and southern parts of the country, and Russia’s lease on the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, where its Black Sea Fleet is currently based, will run out in 2017, with the concern that the Ukrainian government will refuse to renew it.
Of course, it is not entirely fair to characterize Russia as the big, bad imperialist here. Past conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, most recently last January’s quarrel over gas pipelines to the rest of Europe, have been caused by provocations on both sides. However, Russia cannot be allowed to threaten its neighbor simply because Ukraine looks more favorably toward Western Europe than toward Russia.
While Russia has not done anything illegal in its relations with Ukraine, it is likely to make more moves as the election approaches to push for the election of someone who will be more favorable to Russian interests. If this happens, the United States and NATO cannot sit quietly while Russia bullies Ukraine’s government into following its line. President Obama already showed Moscow that he is willing to be flexible when he agreed to scrap Bush-era plans for a missile defense system viewed by Russia as threatening. Now, he must show that he is also willing to stand up to Russia, and any further attempts to influence the election must be met by strong rebukes. If the United States really wants to “reset” its relations with Russia, then it needs to be willing to stand up to Russia’s attempts to walk over its neighbors. Without the chance to recover from the recession and sort out its own political problems free from Russian intervention, Ukraine will never be able to progress beyond its Soviet past and become a wealthy and solidly-democratic state.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone who’s overheard a lengthy telephone conversation between me and my mother likely felt remotely creeped out, and with good reason. I tell her what I had for lunch that day. I tell her about the problem set I aced. I tell her, far more often, about the problem set I bombed. I tell her about my latest column (hi, Mom!). She responds just as parents should, showing an absurd level of interest in the mundane details of my everyday existence. Yet in the history of this overshare-heavy relationship, I have never once uttered the sentence: “Today, I felt attracted to a man.” (Insert “Harvard students are ugly” joke here.) When a male friend recently expressed a similar sentiment to his similarly-close father, his dad responded as I suspect my mother would—with indifference. “I don’t walk around informing people I’m straight,” he noted. “You shouldn’t be expected to tell people you’re gay.”
The notion of “coming out,” as it’s currently conceived, developed shortly after the Stonewall riots of 1969. Michael Fader, who witnessed the rebellion, later described it as a turning point in the history of the gay and lesbian community: “There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we’re going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren’t going to go away. And we didn’t.” The violent reaction to a longstanding history of abuse and repression lent a political  connotation to the practice. According to the Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture, a project of glbtq, Inc., coming out is not merely “coming out of the loneliness, isolation, and self-hatred of the closet,” but is “a form of political activism that participants hope will increase support for glbtq causes.” In this sense, the act can be seen as an assertion of one’s presence, a firm claim to personhood comparable to the one that was uttered four decades ago in the streets of Greenwich Village.
Yet the process of coming out carries with it its own series of stifling implications. First, it places a burden on all of us to categorize our sexual identity instead of giving it free rein, demanding that we label ourselves as gay, straight, or bisexual instead of openly and honestly coming to terms with our desires over a lifetime of sexual maturation. The view of sexuality as a ternary, rather than a spectrum, is enforced by a taxonomic, unsubtle paradigm. The pressure is particularly overbearing when one is expected to come out at a young age. With the passage of every National Coming Out Day on every college campus in America comes an imploration to define oneself as one way, another, or firmly in between.
Even more damaging is the premise that all those who find themselves in the sexual-orientation minority are necessarily in a place of self-loathing until their interpersonal interactions in some way validate their identity. As Adrian Gillan of Gaydar Nation wrote, discussing United Kingdom National Coming Out Day: “Of course, the very notion of coming out implies you were once in a closet to come out of.” In a society rife with judgment and prejudice, being different is often all one needs to feel alienated and estranged from mainstream culture. Why add to this burden by demanding that individuals declare their sexuality to the world in order to fully realize it? This is certainly not to imply that homosexual activity should be swept under the rug, but only to say that an unwillingness to utter the words “I’m gay” doesn’t evidence a lack of self-acceptance, or a desire to deceive. It can, and often does, simply mean that one doesn’t care to cater to the biases of a society that assumes heterosexuality to be the default and believes that one’s otherness must be declared in one fell swoop, lest a queer be mistaken for a straight.
Of course, we don’t live in an ideal world. Gillan himself acknowledges that “the closet...is surprisingly all-pervading and going nowhere fast,” since we are far from an era in which “sexuality is a genuine non-issue.” But the way to phase out flawed social constructions is hardly to indulge them.  Coming out has become a highly ritualized process, an often-traumatic coming-of-age requirement for all those who deviate from arbitrary societal norms for sexual behavior. Rather than demanding, as glbtq, Inc. seems to, that people partake in this ritual in order to be true activists for issues important to the gay community, the process of coming out should be reserved for those who truly deem the act empowering. We should encourage individuals who don’t feel this way to simply be, without feeling obligated to make grand proclamations to their friends and family. More importantly, society must present an environment that is supportive to those personal preferences, normalizing homosexuality and truly withholding judgment. Freedom, after all, is a long time overdue.

Institute of Politics Visiting Fellow and former U.S. Senator Norman B. “Norm” Coleman explained his belief that the United States is an essentially center-right nation and answered questions about terrorism, social issues, and the future of the Republican party at an event last night.
Coleman—a former Democrat who was elected as a Republican senator from Minnesota in 2002 and lost a controversial 2008 reelection bid to Al Franken ’73—described center-right views as “moderate in tone” but “bold in scope and passion.”
“Center-right America has values that can lead America forward boldly,” Coleman said at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
According to data Coleman presented at the speech, 37 percent of Americans self-identify as political centrists, while 40 percent place themselves to the right of center and 20 percent to the left of center.
As of print time, a Pollster.com rolling average of polls showed 35.5 percent of Americans self-identifying as “independent,” 34.4 percent as “Democrats,” and 22.3 percent as “Republicans.”
In response to questions about health care, the economy, and social issues, Coleman stressed finding common ground as necessary to solving major problems. He commended the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 for his ability to “find a path to something we can all agree on.”
Coleman also discussed the importance of using the “will of people as expressed by the legislature” to enact change rather than allowing individual judges to make decisions.
Christopher Frugé ’13, an IOP liaison to Coleman during his visit, said he “liked [Coleman’s] bipartisan approach to politics.” Coleman, Frugé added, believes most politicians “have the same goals but have different ways to get there.”
“It was interesting to have a Republican speaker at a university,” said Ariella E. Rotenberg ’13, another IOP liaison to Coleman.
The future of the Republican Party, Coleman said, depends on the GOP’s ability to reach out to such constituent groups as young voters.
According to this week’s Gallup poll, 66 percent of those within the age range of 18 to 29 currrently give Obama a positive job approval rating, far higher than those in other age groups. Only 45 percent of those 65 and older give him a positive raiting.
In response to a question about Republican viability among college students, Coleman said the non-intrusive philosophy of the GOP is a better fit with a generation that “is in such control of its lives.”
“We just aren’t doing a good job articulating it,” Coleman added.

As of Friday Nov. 27, more than half of Harvard’s security guards may find themselves unable to afford health care coverage for the coming year, due to a sharp increase in the cost of their Blue Cross Blue Shield health plan.
Those with individual plans would face a 60 percent increase in their “contribution requirement” towards their monthly premiums; those with family plans would face a 64 percent increase. This would raise family plan premiums from $335 to $550 a month, roughly equivalent to one week’s pay for most security guards, according to Arun Malik, a security guard in Mather House and a steward for Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 615, which represents the security guards.
The University currently guarantees part of the cost of employee health premiums. It calculates its contributions based on the lowest-cost health insurance plan available to a given group of employees.
For Harvard staff with Harvard Pilgrim or Harvard University Group Health Plan (HUGHP) coverage, the University pays for about 85 percent of premium costs.
But Harvard security guards are employed via a subcontract with Securitas Security Services USA, Inc., which requires them to hold the more expensive Blue Cross plan.
The University subsidy for Blue Cross is equivalent to the cash value of the Pilgrim/HUGHP subsidy. Because it does not correspond to a fixed proportion of the Blue Cross premiums, once the cost of Blue Cross increases, Harvard will only cover about 65 percent of next year’s raised Blue Cross premium.
Last year, Harvard covered 74 percent of the Blue Cross costs for individual plans and 76 percent for family plans.
Securitas notified the guards of the increase last Tuesday, Nov. 12, and initially required them to submit their intention to continue their current plan in writing by this Friday, Nov. 20, according to SEIU representative Matthew Gulish.
In response to union requests, Securitas extended the deadline to next Friday, Nov. 27 and University officials agreed to meet with union representatives.
The union is proposing that the University allow all the security guards to switch to the Harvard Pilgrim plan, after which Harvard would subsidize 85 percent of premium costs as normal.
Malik emphasized that the switch would result in no additional financial burden to the University, as the cost of the current subsidy is equivalent to 85 percent of the Harvard Pilgrim plan’s premium.
But the University says that it can only choose health coverage for its direct employees.
“The guards are employed by Securitas, not the University, and so the University does not have the ability to choose their health care provider,” read a statement released by University spokesman Kevin Galvin. “The choice of health care plans is an issue that should be discussed between Securitas and its employees.”
Gulish said he was pleased the employees had been given extra time to decide on their plan, but he emphasized that the union would consider all options to ensure the quality and affordability of its members benefits.
“With the guards up against the walls, we’ll have to consider all options to pressure Harvard and Securitas to be more cooperative with us and help us find an equitable solution,” he said.
Faced with higher costs, Malik estimated that over half of Harvard’s security guards would opt out of their health coverage, either relying on their spouses’ insurance or forgoing a health plan altogether.
One security guard, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that many of the younger guards with families would opt to go without insurance and instead pay the penalty the state requires of the uninsured.
“I’m older, so I’ll be forced to take the hit,” he said. “Some of the younger guys trying to raise a family just can’t afford it.”
Malik also emphasized that with many guards likely opting out of the plan this year, next year’s premiums will increase even more drastically. He worried the spikes would trap the guards in an “insurance death spiral” so that ultimately none of the guards would be able to afford the insurance plan.

College Confidant, a networking Web site that aims to demystify college life and the admissions process, launched Monday.
Web site founders Amy A. Skaria ’10, Tej A. Toor ’10, Christopher “Kai” Wu ’09, Nitesh K. Banta ’08, and Amit S. Patel ’07 developed the site’s concept on the heels of a survey they conducted of 350 Harvard students. According to their survey, 62 percent of Harvard students had, during their own application and matriculation process, sought out college students for advice. 92 percent said they provided similar advice to other high school students.
College Confidant connects teenagers going through the college admissions process with college students from their college of interest, or with whom they share similar interests or backgrounds. It also provides admissions and application advice.
The site features profiles of current college students—“confidants”— searchable by college, high school, hometown, major, interests, and activities. A high school student is provided with the phone number of a college student of their choice and can schedule calls and meetings through the Web site.
Co-founder Skaria said that a high school student would feel more comfortable asking a college student questions than they would asking an admissions officer.
“It’s more personalized, you’re talking to someone who could be your friend,” she said.
Co-founder Toor said that College Confidant was particularly valuable because high school students are receiving advice from those who have recently gone through the college application process themselves.
Confidants typically charge $10 to $20 per hour. The founders cited the low price as an important difference between College Confidant and other college counseling services, which can charge up to $2000.
Skaria, Toor, and Wu all express optimism regarding their startup’s future. “Our goal for now is proving the concept,” Wu said. “We want to see if this model works and is comfortable for people to use.”
The business currently has campus managers and contacts at Stanford, Princeton, and Yale.
The founders said they hope to continue expanding its coverage, eventually incorporating graduate schools.
Wu said that increasing the number of institutions represented on College Confidant will allow for better match-ups between confidants and high school students who use the Web site.
College Confidant also operates a related blog featuring posts on topics such as admissions essays, sculpting applications, and college life.
The founders said they also hope to launch a non-profit branch to provide similar services to students who cannot afford the fees charged on CollegeConfidant.com.

Maybe the witches and wizards of the Harvard Quidditch team know a spell to ward off budget cuts. Despite fiscal pressure at the University, Harvard’s competitive Quidditch team recently conjured up a $600 grant—primarily to purchase broomsticks.
The fictional sport, concocted by J.K. Rowling in her popular Harry Potter novels, has become a reality on college campuses across the country.
This fall, Harvard joined the ranks of the more than 200 universities that play Quidditch, “the nation’s fastest-growing college sport,” according to Stacy L. Rush, co-founder of the Harvard team.
“I was a little disappointed that Harvard didn’t have [a Quidditch team],” said Rush, a visiting undergraduate from Toronto and avid Harry Potter fan who playfully insists that she was recruited on a Quidditch scholarship.
“And then I realized—hey, that’s what I’m here for,” she said.
Rush and team co-founder Alana J. Biden ’11 received a $600 club sports grant to fund their equipment, which, according to Rush, is the typical sum allotted to a club team. The team used the money to purchase two Quaffles (volleyballs in Muggle parlance), two Bludgers (kickballs), three hoops for use as goals, and 14 broomsticks.
These brooms, which were the priciest item on the team’s shopping list, were purchased to comply with Intercollegiate Quidditch Association (IQA) regulations. The team bought 14 Scarlet Hawk brooms—for a total of $583.10—from Alivan’s, a Florida-based company that markets Harry Potter-themed products.
A wooden broom from Dickson Bros. True Value Hardware in Harvard Square costs between $7.49 and $12.49.
Alivan’s, the only IQA-approved broom manufacturer, makes its brooms entirely by hand, using solid sassafras or oak wood and hand-tied straw, according to David A. Wedzik, Alivan’s founder.
Recent Middlebury College graduate and Commissioner of the IQA Alex R. Benepe said that while regulation broomsticks are not required in Quidditch matches, they pose several advantages. The brooms are shorter than regular household brooms and thus easier to maneuver on the playing field.
“It’s a full-contact sport,” Rush said, adding, “It’s co-ed and it’s full-contact.”
Despite their high price tag, three of the Harvard team’s new brooms broke on first use last weekend in a game against Tufts. Their next game is Friday, against arch-rival Yale.
Rush called Alivan’s about the broken brooms, and Wedzik said he agreed to upgrade seven of them to the sturdier but more expensive Scarlet Falcon model for a reduced fee.
Rush justified the expense of purchasing official Quidditch broomsticks: “The brooms can fly,” she said.

When the Leonid meteoroid shower streaked across the sky in 1833, people in the northeastern United States took the deluge of bright, flying particles as a sign of the impending apocalypse.
But students who camped out at two o’clock yesterday morning hoping to see a spectacular display of shooting stars said they were underwhelmed.
“I don’t see [anything],” said Alex Cherenfant ’13, who briefly mistook an airplane for a slow-moving meteor. “Maybe one.”
The shower occurs each year when Earth passes through the trail of dust that follows the Tempel-Tuttle comet. Dust from the comet, which orbits the Sun once every 33 years, passing close to the Earth, can burn through our atmosphere at speeds of 160,000 miles per hour.
“You get the trail of a comet passing through the earth’s atmosphere; you get more meteors and a better chance of brighter meteors the closer it gets,” said Samuel M. Meyer ’13, a hopeful astrophysics concentrator.
Swathed in blankets on the roof of the Science Center, students chatted, took pictures, and waited for the few visible meteors to appear. As time wore on, one student began playing star-themed music like “Yellow” by Coldplay and “Fireflies” by Owl City on laptop speakers.
Reports predicted that viewers in China could see as many as 300-400 meteors per hour, but the bright lights shining all night in Boston limited visibility.
“Unfortunately, being a city, Boston has a great deal of light pollution, so this is not an ideal location,” said Talia M. Fox ’13.
By 5:00 A.M. the last meteors had fallen and most students returned for a few hours of rest before class.
“I have 9 A.M. section, followed by 10 A.M. Arabic, followed by noon expos, and 2:30 psych,” added Meylakh M. Barshay ’13 who was trekking back up JFK St. after watching the meteor shower at the Stadium. “The stars weren’t worth it.”

Institute of Politics Visiting Fellow and former U.S. Senator Norman B. “Norm” Coleman has spent the past three decades working in public service. Coleman became mayor of St. Paul, Minn. in 1993 and won his Senate seat in 2002. His prolonged battle for reelection grabbed national headlines, ending with his  concession to Al Franken ’73 last June.
The Crimson sat down with Coleman to talk about his time in the Senate and what lies ahead.
The Harvard Crimson: You were once an outspoken Democrat but switched to the Republican Party in 1996. What motivated you to switch parties?
Norm Coleman: I was a reformer as a young student in the 1960s, and I was a reformer as a mayor. I cut taxes, limited the size of government, worked in partnership with the business community, and was very tough on crime. I took over a city that was dead and dying in the early 1990s and saw revitalization by the principles that I used, which were clearly consistent with Republican principles.
THC: What was your proudest achievement in the Senate?
NC: On the policy side, it is the work I did on the U.N. I led investigations into the Oil-for-Food scam that Saddam Hussein perpetrated. That became part of a larger discussion on U.N. reform. My lament is that it hasn’t gone far enough—that the U.N. still needs reform. I believe we need a United Nations, but if we’re going to make that investment, we need greater transparency and accountability.
THC: You’ve been a strong proponent of the War on Terror. What kind of advice would you give President Obama as he mulls policy in Afghanistan?
NC: My advice on Afghanistan—I’ll be cautious on this—is to listen to your commanders, listen to [General Commander Stanley A.] McChrystal, set a course and follow through with it. I don’t object to the President taking time to reflect on Afghanistan. My concern is that it becomes politicized, that there is discussion that the President may somehow compromise between various plans. We’re involved in a war. Lives are on the line. It’s not about compromise.
THC: If given the chance again, would you still hold out for the Minnesota Senate seat?
NC: I’m not sure what you mean by hold out. I got more votes on Election Day. The decision was made after a legal battle in which the other side had more absentee ballots counted than we did. They [the Franken campaign] chose a strategy that allowed them to get more of their votes counted. We had a strategy based on equal protection. There were literally thousand of votes in Republican areas that still have not been counted. I have no regrets about fighting hard to get somebody’s vote counted.
THC: Do you plan to seek the Minnesota governorship?
NC: I’m not going to make that decision for a little bit. I thought it was important to step away from the political process. It’s really nice waking up in the morning and reading the paper and realizing that nobody is trying to kill you politically today. I’m a public servant at heart, but I haven’t made a final decision on whether being the governor is the best way to do that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former three-star North Korean General Yoo Sung Kim discussed his time in and escape from a concentration camp yesterday in Emerson Hall, strongly rebuking the government of Kim Jong Il and those states that provide North Korea with foreign aid.
General Kim, who was detained for a year and a half before fleeing, argued that the state intercepts a large portion of foreign aid intended for private recipients. As a result, countries providing aid are inhibiting the emergence of government-independent market activity.
This activity, General Kim said, began during the severe famine in the mid-1990s and grew due to popular recognition that citizens could not rely on the government to sustain them.
The North Korean state closed the nation’s largest non-governmental market hub — Pyongsong, on the outskirts of Pyongyang — in June of this year, and in January, it placed broad restrictions of the operation of such marketplaces.
However, independent commerce continues “making North Korean citizens richer and freer from the government, and making the government weaker,” Kim said through a translator.
The current regime, Kim argued, is swallowing goods delivered as foreign aid and reselling it to its intended recipients, hurting its efficacy in fighting poverty.
As a member of the governing class, Kim said that he, like many others in power, did not realize the extent to which North Korea laborers were impoverished until he was imprisoned.
“In prison, I saw people starving and the hardship they faced,” Kim said.
Incarcerated in 1999 for involvement in an attempted military coup, Kim bribed officials after six months’ imprisonment and was released two months later. He fled with his family, making his way to South Korea in March 2001, where he worked for that country’s National Intelligence Service (NIS).
The former general argued that few in North Korea can understand how economically weak the country is until they escape to other nations.
When 400,000 people fled North Korea in 2000, “the government lost the means through which they were controlling the population” into thinking that the country’s economic state was satisfactory, Kim said.
Harvard Undergraduates for Human Rights in North Korea (HRiNK) invited Kim to speak as part of the organization’s “North Korean Awareness Week,” according to organization member Ja-Yoon “Uni” Choe ’12.
Margaret L. Park, a first-year student at the Graduate School of Education, noted that the talk focused more on the problems with the North Korean aid regime, rather than possible solutions.
“I left with the feeling of a little hopelessness,” Park said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first meeting after the Cambridge Public School Committee elections two weeks ago, committee members discussed the socioeconomic divide plaguing city middle schools.
Yesterday’s meeting focused on enrollment and transfer rates, geographical distribution of students, and the intensive studies program.
Student enrollment throughout all 12 public middle schools showed an increase of about 100 students per year for the past three years. 45 percent of these students come from low-income families, 55 percent from high-income families.
Individual schools showed enormous variation. Amigos, Fletcher-Maynard, Haggerty, Morse, and Tobin School all reported that over 60 percent of their students come from low-income families. Baldwin, Graham and Parks, and King Open all had above 60 percent of students coming from high-income families.
Many school committee members, including Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young, saw this socioeconomic imbalance as “problematic.”
This socioeconomic imbalance also manifested itself in uneven geographic distribution of students in six of schools mentioned above. Only Tobin and Graham and Parks saw many students enroll from non-neighboring areas.
“The way [enrollment] breaks down ethnically and in income is disturbing,” Young said.
Schools with skewed socioeconomic distribution are also seeing high student-transfer rates. Schools in wealthier areas of Cambridge are experiencing stable or increasing enrollment, while schools in poorer neighborhoods experience high rates of attrition. For instance, Baldwin and Graham & Parks had twice as many students enrolling than leaving; Amigos, however, had four times as many students leaving than enrolling.
“Too many transfers create racial and socioeconomic isolation,” committee member Joseph G. Grassi said.
Committee member Luc D. Schuster was not convinced that the transfer rate is problematic. “We need to consider the number of kids who are transferring more than once and the schools the kids are leaving from,” he said.
According to Schuster, 5 percent of Cambridge middle school students transfer schools.
Student enrollment in the ISP also showed socioeconomic imbalance—only 27 percent of students from low income families elect to participate in the program.
Deputy Superintendent Carolyn L. Turk⁡ said that while in previous years the intensive studies program application required test scores, parent requests, and teacher recommendations, the program is now open to all who are interested.
Committee member Mark C. McGovern said that how teachers encourage their students may be influencing  intensive studies program enrollment, adding that “how we push the students who don’t fit into the categories” is crucial.
Turk said that many families may be satisfied with their children’s performance without their having to enroll in enrichment programs.
“The bottom line is, we need to provide programs that are rigorous, healthy and that invoke curiosity,” she said.

Wycliffe Grousbeck, managing partner, governor, and CEO of the Boston Celtics basketball team, yesterday presented Harvard Business School students with a four-point plan for success modeled off the negotiation strategies he used to acquire the Boston Celtics in 2002.
The basketball team won their 17th championship in June 2008.
Grousbeck, who formed and led the investment group that bought the Boston Celtics, recommended setting a goal and aiming high, assessing what resources are needed, collaborating with the appropriate individuals, and remaining steadfast to reach the ultimate objective.
Grousbeck highlighted the importance of career choices and advised graduate students to do something that they loved.
“I guess I would ask you to think about what you would do after you won the lottery,” he said. “What would you do for free?”
Grousbeck told the audience that he worked as an attorney for four years, but left the legal field when he realized that he was not happy in that profession.
“The people who haven’t failed are the ones who are afraid to fail,” he said.
“And you can’t be afraid to fail if you’re an entrepreneur.”
Grousbeck comes from a family of entrepreneurs. His father co-founded Continental Cablevision Inc after college, eventually selling the company for $11.5 million.
Grousbeck said he was motivated to buy the Celtics when he watched the sale of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to New England Sports Ventures. At the time, the basketball team was on sale for $360 million—then the most expensive team in the history of the NBA. It made $23 million per year.
Grousbeck told the audience that he immediately decided to raise and borrow money to offset the costs of purchasing the Boston Celtics by forming and leading an investment group.
“The days just began to fly by and it didn’t feel like work. I’d be out there in the arena, I’d be risking it all while being part of something bigger than myself,” Grousbeck said.
The Boston Celtics basketball team is also partially owned by Stephen Pagliuca, a Democrat running for the open Massachusetts Senate seat and a managing director at Bain Capital.

An emergency “climate congress” charged with finding solutions to local environmental problems and recommending new government programs will convene in Cambridge Dec. 12.
The congress, which is organized through the mayor’s office, is designed to jump start local action on environmental problems.
In 2002, Cambridge pledged to reduce city-wide emissions 20 percent by 2010. Since then, emissions have increased by at least 17 percent, according to the mayor.
Cambridge Mayor Denise Simmons said the city government needed to do more to “inject environmentally friendly practices” into the community and to “influence more global activities.” Simmons plans to use the Congress’ findings in  any suggestions the City makes to the state and federal government, as well as to the global summit on climate change occurring in Copenhagen in June of 2010.
Early in January, world leaders had hoped that the Copenhagen summit would lead to a new climate accord. But climate legislation has lost momentum in Congress.  Leaders said this week that no agreement would be reached in Copenhagen.
“Cambridge is very progressive, proactive, and innovative,” said the mayor, adding that she hopes Cambridge will “serve as an example for [other] municipal governments.”
The mayor said she is “particularly excited” about the Congress because “it may plot an agenda that hasn’t been plotted before.”
Katie S. Walter ’10, co-president of the  Environmental Action Committee, said she was glad to see local government taking action to combat climate change.
“This is a great opportunity because ...it is cities and mayors that need to take the initiative,” Walter said.
The congress will run throughout the day and is open to 100 community participants. A second session will follow in January.
Applications to participate are due Dec. 1 and are available online. Mayor Simmons said that the climate congress should reflect “the huge diversity that is present in our city.”
“Cambridge does fantastic stuff, and the continuing commitment to environmental issues is very important,” said Jackson S. Salovaara ’11, another member of the EAC, “The municipal level’s actions...[show] what should be done at the state and national levels.”

Although the women of the Crimson basketball team delivered a not-so stellar performance last night, their offense was able to shine through and deliver a 72-56 victory over Maine.
Harvard improved to 2-0 this season, a mark that it has not achieved in the past four years.
The Crimson’s young talent stole the show against Maine.
Freshman Victoria Lippert led Harvard’s scoring with 24 points.
She shot 10 of 12 from the field and completed three three-pointers out of four attempts.
While Lippert was a consistent star throughout the game, other standouts saved their demonstrations of offensive skill for the second half.
Junior co-captain Claire Wheeler did not make it on the scoreboard in the first half, but the forward successfully completed five shots out of 10 attempts and posted a total of 15 points in the final frame.
“She definitely sparked us—her and Victoria definitely sparked us in the second half,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said.
“At any given time, any of us could step up, but this time, it was definitely Claire...so it’s pretty much expected.”
Wheeler’s statistics did not go unnoticed, but according to Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, last night’s game was not indicative of the co-captain’s full potential.
“I thought Claire Wheeler put the ball in the basket, but there were times when she was a superstar and times when she [could have played] a whole lot better,” Smith said.
“She can’t miss layups. She made some beautiful strong moves and then she bobbled it…that said, her stats are a big game for her.”
As a team, Harvard shot nearly 50 percent from the field and almost 60 percent in the second half alone.
Offensively, the Crimson compensated for its otherwise fragmented team play.  Maine out-rebounded Harvard by 11 and the players and the coaching staff felt the lack of cohesiveness.
“There was erratic, sporadic, soft defense. There was no leadership from point, either point,” Smith said.
Sophomore point guard Brogan Berry posted only five points, all of which were scored in the first half.
Berry matched her statistics from this past weekend’s game against Boston College, in which she also posted five points.
Smith had a few explanations as to why Berry’s statistics might not reflect her actual potential.
“She’s a young player,” Smith said. “And if I was to overanalyze, I’d say she’s missing shots she shouldn’t and I think that’s probably getting under her skin and distracting her a bit.”
As to how Berry could improve for future matchups, Smith had a few ideas.
“She knows at the top of her list is being a vocal leader,” Smith said.
“And she’s a prolific scorer and I’d love her to be, but she doesn’t have to be. We have so many other weapons. I just don’t want it getting under her skin, she’s too much of an asset for that.”
Members of the team acknowledged that there was work to be done on both sides of the court.
“[Our performance] was a little disappointing,” Matera said.
“We didn’t come out as tough as we did in the BC game, so it was a little bit of a letdown. There are things we need to work on, like to be consistent no matter who we play.”
“The positive [thing] that we have to take away from the game is that we won pretty handily even though we didn’t play our best,” Matera added. “But we just need to be consistent no matter who we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Crimson soundly defeated Maine yesterday, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith struggled to find a high point in her team’s play—that is, other than the play of freshman guard Victoria Lippert.
“She was the only bright star in tonight’s game,” Delaney-Smitoh said. “I have little to no criticisms about what she did.”
Lippert was Harvard’s leading scorer in the 72-56 victory, putting up 24 points in as many minutes of playing time and shooting 83 percent from the floor.
“She’s definitely a scorer,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said. “I mean she was just too strong for the other team. Anything she wanted she got.”
Lippert had her way against the Black Bears from three-point territory. In the first half alone, the freshman sank three shots from afar, more than Maine’s entire roster in all 40 minutes.
The Crimson’s coach recognized Lippert’s impressive 80 percent efficiency from behind the arc, but also pointed out the freshman’s versatility.
“She can hit threes, but she can also take it to the basket,” Delaney-Smith said. “There was that one move where she stepped in and made the shot with [her left hand] from eight or nine feet out. I mean that’s a good move for a freshman.”
But when it came to recognizing her own accomplishments, Lippert was much more reserved.
“I’m just very humbled and grateful to have the opportunity to come out and perform,” Lippert said.
Continuing with her modesty, the rookie stressed the role of her surroundings in contributing to her success thus far.
“It definitely wouldn’t be possible without our coaches, and teammates, and the people around me,” Lippert said. “I’m very blessed to be here and to be able to do the things I can do.”
In fact, the staff and players that make up Harvard’s program were what convinced the freshman to come to Cambridge instead of heading to Pac-10 power Stanford.
“I came to Harvard because I love the people here,” Lippert said. “There’s a really good environment and I’m just having a ball with the team.”
Her teammates reciprocate the appreciation, praising the performances Lippert has been able to produce in her short Harvard career thus far.
“She’s played well, and that’s not unexpected,” Matera said. “ We’ve seen it all through the preseason and we expect her to keep stepping up.”
Her performance in this game continued a pattern she established straight from the get-go.
Lippert started in the team’s exhibition games and the season-opener last Saturday against Boston College. In the nail-biting victory for the Crimson, she contributed 14 points and four rebounds.
“Victoria is just flat-out a player, in every regard,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s serious about her basketball, she’s very intense, she’s very competitive, and she’s very talented.”
While Lippert was timid in pointing out her own achievements last night, she had no problem making clear Harvard’s goals for the season.
“This year we’re going for title 12,” the freshman said after last night’s win. “I think that’s definitely achievable and we’re going to work really hard to continue coming together as a unit in order to accomplish that.”
If her early play is any indication, Lippert is destined to be a key part of any of the Crimson’s future success this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I hate to say I told you so, but I will anyway.
Earlier this year (September 17 to be exact), I predicted a slew of accolades for the Harvard men’s soccer team. My selections–Andre Akpan for Ivy Player of the Year, Brian Rogers for Rookie of the Year, and the Crimson as Ivy Champions–could have easily been cast aside as biased prognostications from a Cambridge-based columnist. Fast-forward two months and I’m now looking like a 21st-century Nostradamus.
All of my aforementioned predictions have come to fruition, and the three teams I picked to receive NCAA invites will be commencing their postseason campaigns this weekend. What happened to Penn, co-defending Ivy champions, who I picked to miss out on the tournament? Yeah, its season is done.
And what about the five individuals I singled out as players to watch in the league this year? Yup, all five made it onto the All-Ivy First Team.
I can’t, however, replace Miss Cleo as the new go-to psychic hotline. My call on the Princeton Tigers, who I said would “certainly contend” but narrowly miss out on postseason play, was way off. A mid-season slump gave way to a seven-game undefeated streak to end the season as the Tigers tore through the second half of their Ivy schedule. Princeton led the league with eight members receiving All-Ivy selections. The late-season run allowed the Tigers to qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001. It also gave the Ivy League four representatives in the tournament, the most since 1977.
I thought Princeton had the makings of a good squad earlier this season–I did not think they would be this good so quickly.
THE IVY LEAGUE FIRST XI
In arguably one of the most impressive Ivy seasons ever, four teams battled until the last weekend of the season to decide the championship. Even Cornell, who finished 1-15 last year, enjoyed a successful campaign finishing at .500 with a 6-6-5 record. It wasn’t easy selecting my picks for the Ivy League First XI; don’t be surprised if you see a few of these players continuing their careers as professionals in the near future.
Goalkeeper: Austin Harms, Sophomore, Harvard
Can someone explain to me how a keeper who boasts a league-leading .66 goals-against-average and a .889 save percentage in Ivy play doesn’t merit consideration in any of the All-Ivy squads? Sure, Brown’s Paul Grandstand–selected as the goalkeeper on the All-Ivy first team–is a stud, but Harms’ statistics are better. All Harms did was anchor a league-leading defense that allowed the fewest goals while posting six shutouts and recording a higher cumulative save percentage than anyone in the league.
Defenders: Kwaku Nyamekye, Senior, Harvard; Josh Walburn, Junior, Princeton; Evan Coleman, Sophomore, Brown
Although Nyamekye wasn’t even a natural defender to start his career, the forward-turned-centerback has delivered four impressive years on the Crimson backline. He made it onto the All-Ivy first team for the second year in a row (one of only two players this year selected unanimously) and started all 17 games. Coleman and Walburn deserve recognition for their inspired play all year. As a midfielder/defender, Coleman scored six goals and had three assists for the Tigers, while Walburn led a Brown defense that allowed the second fewest goals in the league and only 14 all season.
Midfielders: Daniel Keat, Junior, Dartmouth; Nick Elenz-Martin, Senior, Brown; Antoine Hoppenot, Sophomore, Princeton; Sean Rosa, Sophomore, Brown
Keat, a member of the New Zealand national team, made the All-Ivy first team in his freshman year but an injury in 2008 rendered him unavailable for the entire season. The Kiwi came back strong this year, leading his team in points (seven goals, six assists), and started every game for the first time in his career. Sophomore Hoppenot led a young but ferocious Princeton attack (most goals scored in the league) with 10 goals and two assists. The Bear duo of Elenz-Martin and Rosa combined for nine goals and 10 assists as Brown earned its fifth consecutive invitation to the NCAA tournament.
Forwards: Andre Akpan, Senior, Harvard; Lucky Mkosana, Sophomore, Dartmouth; Brian Rogers, Freshman, Harvard
I could write an entire column on Akpan’s achievements; instead I’ll just say this: 11 goals, six assists, 4.0 shots per game (all, of course, tops in the league). Better pack your things now for St. Louis (home of the Hermann Trophy presentation); it might also be a good idea to prepare for the 2010 MLS SuperDraft. Mkosana, second in the league with eight goals, built upon his Rookie of the Year campaign last season with 19 points and will be one of the top contenders for Player of the Year next season. His successor for Rookie of the Year, Brian Rogers, delivered an impressive inaugural season, augmenting Akpan’s contributions with six goals and five assists of his own. Fears of a Crimson decline after Akpan graduates should be subdued with the impressive play of a strong Harvard rookie class.
Honorable Mentions: midfielder Adam Rousmaniere, midfielder Brian Grimm (Harvard); defender Mark Linnville, forward Matt Sanner (Princeton); goalkeeper Paul Grandstand (Brown); midfielder Craig Henderson (Dartmouth); forward Matt Bouraee (Cornell)
Weekend Predictions
Boston College 3, Dartmouth 1
The Big Green eliminated the Eagles in a penalty shootout thriller last season en route to a quarterfinal appearance but I’m afraid the Hanover squad won’t be so lucky this time around. Dartmouth fell apart at the end of the season, losing four of its last six games, including a 3-0 loss against Brown. It was a surprising decline given its attacking options. The only hope: Boston College has lost both its games against Ivy League opponents this season (Harvard, 2-0 and Yale, 2-1).
Prediction: Princeton 2, Bucknell 1
The Tigers certainly deserve to still be playing given their play at season’s end and they impressed the NCAA committee enough to earn themselves a home game in the first round. The Bison haven’t played anyone of note this season but enter the tournament as Patriot League champions. Given the momentum Princeton enters the tournament with, I think it’ll get an easy result here. No. 2 Virginia looms ahead in the second round.
Prediction: Brown 2, Stony Brook 0
The Bears find themselves on the same side of the bracket as Dartmouth, but both teams will need to make the quarterfinals to face off. While the Big Green’s prospects look dour, Brown is hosting one of the two teams in the tournament with a sub-.500 record. The Seawolves have gone undefeated in their last seven games but a staunch Brown defense will put an end to their run. For sake of comparison, Stony Brook lost 4-1 to Harvard earlier this season.
The Crimson’s fourth straight NCAA appearance comes with a long overdue bye into the second round. The committee gave no favors to Harvard, however; the Crimson’s two possible second round opponents are both ranked in the top 15. The No. 7 Monmouth Muhawks (what?) out of New Jersey have lost only once this season and have already defeated two Ivy League teams (Cornell, 4-1 and Princeton, 1-0). They host No. 12 Connecticut, who you’ll painfully remember as the team who ravaged Harvard 4-0 earlier this season. The Huskies were upset in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament, but despite having to travel to Monmouth, I believe they’re the favorites to play the Crimson on Sunday.
For a team that boasts arguably the greatest collection of Harvard talent since Chris Ohiri ’64 roamed the field, it would be a shame if the squad didn’t go far in the tournament. If the Crimon can make it past the first game on Sunday, I can see Harvard making a deep run (with No. 8 Maryland and No. 2 Virginia as the chief rivals to a quarterfinal berth).
Of course, I can only make educated guesses on the possible outcome of the Crimson’s season. Harvard will have to determine it for itself on the field.
Let the dances begin.

It's that time of year again--time for another remix challenge, courtesy of the College Events Board. The task? Create a remix to our favorite fight song, 10,000 Men of Harvard, for this weekend's Harvard/Yale game.
There are four contenders for the chance to have their remix played at the pep rally Thursday night. FlyBy took a moment to listen to their creations, and here are our thoughts, after the jump:
Entry 1: Matthias Wickenburg '13
This long remix is carefully crafted. Beginning with the distant sounds of the Harvard band, seemingly in the background, this remix soon adds in fitting electronic beats to create a stretched out version of the song with a seemingly "epic" feel to it.
Entry 2: Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey '13
This remix lays the fight song over some varied electronic backgrounds, adding in pieces of football radio commentary. This mashup feels very relaxed, as though we would simply roll over Yale and that would be the end of it. Very nice.
Entry 3: Lucia Carver '13
Entry number three begins, quite appropriate, by adding in the infamous Kanye diss over the original song. Voices can be heard singing throughout, and it ends with a man saying that one cannot be more happy anyplace else than at Harvard.
Entry 4: Noam Hassenfeld '12
This version of "10,000 Men" is short and very upbeat, playing the song multiple times with varied electronic backgrounds. "I Got a Feeling" by the Black Eyed Peas is featured.
We at FlyBy applaud the efforts by all participants, but we're going with entry 4--it's the fastest and perhaps the most party-appropriate music track, making it a good choice to be played at a pep rally.
Voting ends Wednesday at 11:59 PM. Let's get ready to crush Yale!

Another UC campaign, another violation.
This time around, the George J.J. Hayward '11 and Felix Zhang '11 campaign for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President got a slap on the wrist from the UC's Election Commission in the form of a six hour campaign suspension from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today.
Why, you ask?
Apparently, the campaign stands accused of asking students not on their staff to forward campaign materials. The horror!
Hit the jump for the full text of the reprimand, featuring not one, not two, but four rule citations!
Dear UC and Liaisons,
This constitutes official notice as required by rule 1.7.
Starting at 3:44PM Monday and continuing through at least 2:39AM Tuesday, a Hayward/Zhang staff member repeatedly e-mailed several individuals who were not at the time staff of the Hayward/Zhang campaign. Most of them are still not staff of the campaign. These e-mails instructed these students to forward official campaign material to their dorm, house, or student group e-mail lists. In addition, Brian Ru, Alex Parkinson, and Felix Zhang were all recipients of these e-mails, and are therefore presumed to be aware that they were sent. In at least one instance, one of the individuals e-mailed sent such a campaign e-mail while not on the campaign staff. Several other individuals complained to the EC that they were receiving these e-mails despite having never requested them.
Per rule 2.5, only staff members may engage in campaign activities. Rule 2.7 further specifies that campaign staff may not coordinate the activities of supporters who are not on their staff. Rule 4.1 explicitly includes "distributing campaign material ... electronically" in the definition of campaign activity.
Furthermore, on Monday at 6PM, the EC met with both Brian and Alex, and informed them that an e-mail sent by a different campaign staffer that was similar in form the the e-mails in question was in violation of the rules. At that time, the EC instructed Alex, the campaign liaison, to ensure that all Hayward/Zhang staff were reminded of this rule.
It is therefore the unanimous determination of the EC that the e-mails sent by Hayward/Zhang staffer constitute a violation of rules 2.5 and 2.7, and additionally demonstrate a failure to instruct staff to observe these rules as required by the EC. This is despite the campaign having already been penalized for this same offense yesterday.
As a result, under rule 6.5, it is the unanimous decision of the EC that the Hayward/Zhang Campaign shall be suspended for a period of six hours, beginning at 10AM on Wednesday and ending at 4PM the same day.
During this suspension, all staff on the campaign are prohibited from engaging in campaign activities, including distributing and displaying campaign materials, and e-mailing students on behalf of the campaign. A suspension does NOT require that any campaign materials already
distributed be recalled or taken down. Campaigning during a suspension may result in further penalties, up to and including disqualification.
It shall be the responsibility of the campaign to inform their staffers of this decision and to ensure that the suspension is observed.
Please contact the election commission at this address if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Brad Seiler
Election Commission Chair

While dining with warlords or speaking to a wounded rebel may not sound appealing to all, Nicholas D. Kristof ’82, a columnist at the New York Times, goes to great lengths to uncover the individual stories behind the news. When a group of thirty Harvard students visited Kristof in New York City on a trip hosted by Lowell House this past Monday, the discussion was comprised of anecdotes, both humorous and alarming.
As the group leaned forward eagerly in their seats, raising their hands to be called on in the pseudo-conversation, Kristof casually reclined in his chair at the head of the room. Smiling, he spoke of one particularly terrifying instance, recalling, “Once, we had a truck of soldiers chasing us down a road in the jungle for an entire week until we reached Uganda. Then, to top it all off, I got malaria.”
Kristof’s anecdotes continued as he retold conflicts with governments in a humorous tone. He has been detained more than once and barred from North Korea for life. “Though it must not have been for my life,” Kristof joked, “because a little while later they let me back in.”
He spoke to his interviewees in a nonchalant manner, as though the people and the experiences were common dinner conversation. “The Taliban has kind of screwed up their press relations by kidnapping reporters, now interviews are done over the phone,” noted Kristof. “Actually, I set up the interview with that warlord by emailing his press-handler.”

This year’s annual Harvard-Yale pep rally will be attempting to get you all excited and what-not for this weekend’s game, something we hear people do at other schools.
But this year, no Girl Talk or anyone of his ilk will be in the offing, part of an attempt to cut costs, and, you know, prevent the rally ending in a complete fiasco.  Instead, organizers say they will be taking the rally back to “its roots.”  Oh, and they’ve also procured a stage that won’t collapse.
Thursday’s rally promises a mixture of student performances, a “hotdog bulldog eating contest”, and a slight variation on the standard HUDS spread, a move College Events Board Vice-Chair James A. McFadden ’10 said administrators thought was necessary at an event where students might be drinking.  So should you decide to get sloshed Thursday, there will be free mac and cheese, clam chowder, and Boloco on hand at the Yard.
What this year’s organizers have to say: after the jump!
Organizers this year are working under the shadow of what one student called the most “unsuccessful successful show ever” that saw thousands of students turn out for a highly anticipated show that ended in a nearly collapsed stage and one very pissed DJ Girl Talk.
But organizers say they’ve learned their lesson.
“We're pumped this year! It’s going to be miles and away more successful than last year,” McFadden said. “We learned a lot from last year about how we're supposed to plan.”
But will students show without a big-name performer?
“I’m very excited at this point. I think it's going to be a great show, but I’m a bit nervous about attendance,” CEB Chair Kevin M. Mee ’10 said. “I’m hoping a lot of people will show regardless.”
Today and tomorrow, organizers will be launching a PR-blitz in and around the yard to promote the show.  At the Science  Center, they will be playing the entries of the “10,000 Men of Harvard Re-Mix Challenge.”  Hopefully Perhaps even drowning out the UC candidates’ vote mongering.
The event will kick off at 8:30 with a “FAN-tastic Freshman” contest, so get there early to laugh at the freshmen before they become disillusioned.
“It will be pretty funny for the upperclassmen filing into the yard,” McFadden said, referring to the freshmen’s competition.
The CEB’s portion of the event will begin at 9 and will include appearances by Expressions, the BMF Steppers, the Crimson Dance Team, the Glee Club, and the Harvard Cheerleaders, among others.
“There will be of more hating on Yale this year than a concert—we’re getting back to the basics of destroying Yale,” McFadden said. “So it will be getting back to the roots of what a pep rally is.”
