After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ECAC tournament got off to a rocking start for the Harvard women’s hockey team on Friday afternoon.
Freshman forward Miye D’Oench provided the spark the Crimson needed to take home a momentous victory over Dartmouth after a quiet first frame-and-a-half.
D’Oench picked up a loose puck off of a broken play and carried it into the zone. Opposing goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft came flying out of the crease to no avail, as the Dartmouth goaltender could not break the momentum of the charging D’Oench, who lost her balance and took the puck into the back of the net with her.
“I think everything we do is started by playing physical, tough defense,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We work from there, move it up the ice, and try to start a rush if we can.”
The go-ahead goal was reviewed and upheld as No. 6/7 Harvard (23-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC) went on to beat the Big Green (16-10-5,11-7-4 ECAC), 3-0, in the first of the best of three opening round series.
The night was special for Harvard coach Katey Stone, who reached the 400-win plateau in the successful outing.
“It was incredible,” Dempsey said. “It was a really emotional day for [coach Stone] especially, but to be a part of something like this is much greater than this team. It’s the program, the tradition, and Harvard hockey.”
Fresh off her ECAC rookie of the year award, freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer was perfect in her first postseason appearance, stopping all of the Dartmouth’s 21 attempts on net.
“I think everything kind of clicked,” Maschmeyer said. “It was an awesome first game.”
Though the squad couldn’t find the back of the net early on, Harvard set the tone for what would turn out to be a one-sided affair. Through thirty minutes, the Crimson outshot its opponent 20-11.
Dempsey and junior forward Lyndsey Fry’s agility led to opportunities in close, but freshman forward Mary Parker had the best opportunity of the opening frame. The freshman collected a rebound and launched a shot just wide of a net left open by an out-of-position Holdcroft.
“We just try to get pucks at the net and create traffic in front,” Dempsey said. “Sometimes they’re not going in but the one thing we control is how hard we keep working.”
In the end, Harvard finished with a 42-21 advantage in shots on goal.
After nearly two periods without a a penalty, the Crimson power play unit took over in the third period.
Junior forward Kalley Armstrong received a cross-ice pass from sophomore defender Michelle Picard on the man-advantage and slid the puck behind Holdcroft to provide the first of two insurance goals.
Senior forward Kaitlin Spurling added to her season’s point total while giving Harvard some addittional breathing room.
Her one-timer, set up by sophomore forward Samantha Reber, put the exclamation point on what turned out to be a strong all-around performance.
The Crimson powerplay unit’s success flew in the face of a few regular-season trends.
Coming into the game, Harvard converted on just 16 percent of opportunities while Dartmouth had one of the better powerplay kills in the conference at 87 percent.
The Big Green’s best opportunity of the night also came in the third on a powerplay. The would-be equalizer was acrobatically kicked away by Maschmeyer.
“Their player picked it up and I followed it to the other side of the net,” Maschmeyer said of the second-chance opportunity. “I think that was my biggest [save] of the night. It was kind of a momentum-stopper for them and big for us.”
Including its second win over Dartmouth on Saturday, Harvard has outshot its opponents 235-106 in its last six contests.
“We’ve been dominating teams in my opinion,” Dempsey said. “It was great tonight that we were able to get on the board as much as we did because when that effort starts to pay off, our confidence goes up a little.... Hopefully there is more where that came from.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team played outside for the first time this year over the weekend, but it did not take the Crimson long to adjust to the cold.
Playing in Charlottesville, Va., on Friday, Harvard (1-3) opened up its season with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Bucknell (1-9). Tied at one in the bottom of the tenth with two outs and two strikes, captain Rob Wineski singled up the middle to bring home the winning run.
The walk-off win matched the Crimson’s victory total in its first 17 games last year and was coach Bill Decker’s first win at the helm of Harvard.
Harvard resumed action at Davenport Field against No. 19 Virginia (12-0) just an hour after the win over the Bison. Although the Crimson out-hit the Cavaliers, the team could not string together any offense and fell, 3-0.
Harvard played both teams again on Saturday and lost both after taking early leads.
VIRGINIA 11, HARVARD 5
The Crimson jumped out to a two-run lead in the top of the first after a series of Cavaliers’ throwing errors. Junior shortstop Carlton Bailey scored on a wild pitch and freshman second baseman Mitch Klug followed shortly after on a throwing error.
But a seven-run Virginia fifth doomed Harvard to an 11-5 loss. Sophomore Matt Timoney (0-1) could not finish the inning after coming in in relief for starter Peter Kaplan, who had allowed three earned through four.
Timoney gave up six runs on four hits,, before being pulled with two outs left in the fifth. The Cavaliers ended the inning up 10-4 and cruised from there, as the Crimson only managed two more hits.
BUCKNELL 7, HARVARD 5
Harvard got off to a similarly hot start in the first of Saturday’s double-gamer, going up 4-0 through two as freshman DJ Link and sophomore Brandon Kregel both tallied two RBIs in the first and second, respectively.
But, just as would happen later that afternoon, a disastrous bottom of the fifth prevented the Crimson from securing the victory, with the Bison bagging six runs on six hits to jump out to a 7-4 lead. The teams would remain scoreless thereafter, as Bucknell and Harvard split their weekend series.
Kregel, Link, and Bailey finished the weekend tied for the team-lead with seven hits.
VIRGINIA 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was up for a tough test in the form of Virginia starting pitcher Brandon Waddell, who struck out 15 of the 18 batters he faced in his last outing against Toledo.
Waddell was again dominant in his outing against Harvard, surrendering three hits and striking out seven in six innings.
“He had one of the best change-ups I’ve ever seen,” senior pitcher Matt Doyle said. “A lot of hitters were saying, ‘Great change-up.’”
Although Harvard failed to put up any runs, the Crimson out-hit the Cavaliers seven to five. But while Virginia effectively manufactured their runs, Harvard had no extra-base hits and managed multiple hits in an inning just once.
All three Virginia runs came on sacrifice flies as the Cavaliers played small ball to snag the win.
Bailey paced the Crimson offense with two hits. Link, making his first start behind the plate, also registered a pair of singles.
HARVARD 2, BUCKNELL 1
Playing with a starting lineup in which the first six batters were either freshmen or sophomores, senior leadership still came through when it mattered most for the Crimson.
Kregel got things going for Harvard in the bottom of the tenth when he smacked a two-strike pitch for a triple, his second hit of the game. After two Crimson batters failed to advance Kregel and sophomore Ethan Ferreira was intentionally walked, the stage was set for Wineski.
With the game tied and two outs, Wineski found himself in a 0-2 hole. But the captain slapped the next pitch back up the middle to bring home the winning run and secure Harvard’s first win of the year.
“To win in that kind of fashion, it galvanizes the team and gets everyone to pull on the same rope,” Wineski said. “It’s very exciting, and seeing your teammates’ faces after that all happy and pumped up, there’s just no better feeling in the world.”
The Crimson received two solid pitching performances from senior Matt Doyle and junior Baron Davis (1-0), who combined to allow no earned runs and only five hits.
“It’s a testament to the coaches and how hard those pitchers worked,” Wineski said. “They put in so much work behind the scenes, and they obviously came together today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team continued to scale the Ivy League rankings, taking down Penn, 67-54, on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The victory, which comes just a day after the Crimson (17-8, 8-3 Ivy) halted Princeton’s 33-game league win streak, lifts the squad to a tie with the Quakers (15-10, 8-3) for second place in the Ancient Eight.
For Harvard, it was a chance to exact revenge upon a team that had defeated it, 77-72, in a tricky road contest on Feb. 15.
Junior guard Christine Clark ran the floor with a game-high 18 points and seven rebounds. Clark was trailed by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who also had seven boards and added 14 points.
It was a solid night for the Crimson’s senior class, which was honored in a special pre-game ceremony. Miriam Rutzen, Elle Hagedorn and Victoria Lippert, the three veterans to suit up for the contest, combined for 21 points, 18 rebounds and eight assists.
Harvard opened the contest with stifling defense that held Penn to 1-of-18 shooting from the field until Penn senior guard Alyssa Baron knocked down a three at 5:32 in the first frame, the first long-range make of the game for her team.
But Baron, who put up 13 points through the game, was unable to close in further on the Crimson. Layups from Rutzen and Clark, combined with a pair of Fagbenle foul shots, gave Harvard a 20-point advantage, 33-13.
From there, despite efforts from freshman guard Keiera Ray, who had a team-high 14 points, Harvard continued to hold a commanding lead and play a clean game, with just four fouls in the closing stanza.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in two nights, Harvard faced a 1-1 deadlock after 60 minutes of regulation. But this time, the Crimson found itself on the wrong end of a back-door overtime winner.
A day after upsetting the No. 1 team in the country in overtime, the Harvard men’s hockey team fell to Princeton, 2-1, off a sudden-death strike from junior forward Andrew Calof. With the loss, the Crimson (9-17-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) concludes the ECAC regular season in last place for the first time in program history and will travel to No. 18 Dartmouth for the first round of the conference tournament next weekend.
“We’re obviously disappointed,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I give Princeton a lot of credit; they had the better of shots. We had a lot of great chances, great looks, but we didn’t play our best game by any means.”
With just over a minute left in the extra frame, Princeton coach Bob Prier pulled senior goaltender Mike Condon for an extra attacker after a timeout. The Tigers (10-14-5, 8-10-4) needed a win to clinch home ice for the first round of the ECAC tournament.
On the ensuing faceoff in the Harvard zone, it appeared that the gamble would backfire. After the Crimson came away with the puck, freshman Kyle Criscuolo launched a cross-rink shot. But the play ended in icing as the attempt sailed past the unguarded cage by several feet.
Seconds later, Prier’s bet paid off. With less than 40 ticks left, senior defenseman Michael Sdao found an open Andrew Calof on the far right post with a tape-to-tape cross from the point.
Princeton dominated the shot totals early with three power play opportunities in the first. But the Crimson escaped with a 1-0 lead off a shorthanded goal from senior forward Alex Fallstrom.
Senior forward Luke Greiner won a defensive faceoff and pushed the puck up ice before setting up his classmate for a breakaway. Fallstrom, who had the overtime winner over No. 1 Quinnipiac the previous night, found the back of the net on a nifty backhander.
“I think our penalty kill is really strong, so we came out of those situations really well,” Fallstrom said. “We didn’t let those [penalties] bring us down. That was a really good sign.”
Less than nine minutes into the second period, Sdao evened things at one apiece for the Tigers. The defender’s strike came from just inside the blue line through traffic.
In the final frame of regulation, Princeton unsuccessfully crashed the Harvard net several times. Girard stood tall between the pipes, recording 16 of his 45 saves in the third period.
The Tigers finished the night with a 47-29 advantage in the shot department. The win allowed Princeton to leapfrog over Clarkson and Cornell in the ECAC standings for the No. 8 playoff seed.
Harvard will open tournament play Friday evening for the first of a best-of-three weekend series in Hanover, N.H.  The Crimson lost to Dartmouth on the road, 3-2, on Jan. 12 before tying the Big Green, 1-1, at home on Feb. 10.
“[Dartmouth is] a very good team. We’ve had two really tight games with them so far,” Donato said. “We’ll be excited about the playoffs, and that’s a great match-up.”
After the game, Harvard recognized the team’s six graduating players as part of its Senior Night festivities. The overtime loss marked the final NCAA-sanctioned game at the Bright Hockey Center for Fallstrom, Greiner, captain Danny Biega, Marshall Everson, Conor Morrison, and Brendan Rempel.
“They’re a special group. They really carried the locker room through some tough times this year. They kept everything positive and worked real hard,” Donato said. “As a coach, you get very attached to them. They’re great teammates, great people to coach and to be around. I’m very proud of how far they’ve come, both on and off the ice, and I’m excited heading into the playoffs because of the kind of character they have and the way they were able to play last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking the field for the first time this season, the Harvard softball team went 2-3 at the Florida Atlantic Classic.
The Crimson—fielding a young team—picked up wins against Ball State (8-5) and host Florida Atlantic (6-10), but it fell at the hands of Michigan State (9-7), Eastern Michigan (4-5), and Jacksonville (11-4).
Harvard used the weekend to test different lineups and combinations, as the team played together for the first time with the new freshman class.
Sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz started three of the five games, and freshmen Jamie Halula and Morgan Groom got one start each and pitched in relief.
“I think what we did a good job of was reading scouting reports and trying to match pitchers to lineups,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Against Michigan State] we knew a lefty-lefty matchup would be really effective. We ended up starting Gabby, which worked out really well for us because she kept us in the game.”
MICHIGAN STATE 1, HARVARD 0
The Crimson was held to only two hits in seven innings and was unable to score after singles by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz in the fourth and sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte in the seventh.
“I think the biggest thing we need to work on is becoming more of an offensive powerhouse,” said junior co-captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson. “We have good batters, but we just need to string more hits together. It’s something that will come with time.”
Ruiz took her first loss of the season after allowing three hits in 2.1 innings of work. The Spartans’ only run came in the second, when sophomore catcher Ellie Stoffer reached on a fielding error and was singled home by freshman shortstop Destinee Luna.
HARVARD 3, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 2
Harvard held the lead for most of the game after putting the first run on the board in the bottom of the third. Del Conte singled and stole second, and she was doubled home by third baseman Kasey Lange.
The Owls came back with two in the fourth after Ruiz gave up back-to-back doubles to sophomore designated hitter Laura Mann and junior shortstop Shelby Knox.
After falling behind, 2-1, the Crimson responded with a pair in the fifth and both teams went scoreless for the remainder of the game. After a leadoff single, designated player Haley Davis advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on a single by Lantz.
Lantz moved to second on an intentional walk and came home on a Stephanie Regan single.
Ruiz picked up her second win in as many starts, allowing four hits in her first career complete game.
EASTERN MICHIGAN 3, HARVARD 1
Eagles pitcher Jenna Ignowski pitched a complete game and allowed seven hits, but Harvard struggled to string together offensive plays.
Eastern Michigan added one run in the second but did the most damage in the sixth when center fielder Courtney Nicholson reached second and was doubled home by third baseman Nellie Coquillard.
The run knocked Halula out of the game, and she was replaced by Groom, who allowed the pinch runner to advance on a wild pitch and come home on a single.
Harvard’s only run came in the top of the fifth, when Del Conte singled, stole second, and was brought home by a single by Regan.
HAVARD 7, BALL STATE 6
Ruiz, a sophomore, got the win for the Crimson, striking out one batter and allowing four earned runs in 4.1 innings of work.
The Crimson scored four in the bottom of the first off a grand slam by Gusse who went 3-for-4 on the night and stranded two runners.
Harvard added two more in the second, but the Cardinals turned it on in the top of the fourth, scoring four runs on three doubles.
Ball State tacked on another in the fifth and the seventh and had runners on second and third with two outs, but a groundout lost the Cardinals the game.
JACKSONVILLE 5, HARVARD 1
In it first game of the season, both teams were held scoreless through the first two innings, as starting pitcher Groom struck out the side in the first and did not allow a hit in the second.
The Dolphins added one in the first and two in the fourth, and Harvard responded with its only run of the game on a Lantz homer in the top of the 6th. A Jacksonville two-run jack in the bottom of the inning brought the final score to 5-1.
Brown pitched a complete game and allowed six hits and a walk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 17 received a forwarding pass and swept across the crease to beat Boston Bruins goaltender Anton Khudobin. It wasn’t the first goal the 23-year-old forward had scored at TD Garden, but this one was different.
The last time Alex Killorn ‘12 had played at the Garden, he scored a first-period goal to help the Harvard men’ hockey team past Northeastern, 4-3, in the 2012 Beanpot consolation game. In his return to Boston Saturday afternoon, Killorn found the back of the net once more in the opening frame, this time as a rookie for the Tampa Bay Lightning.
In his 11th career NHL game, Killorn provided the Lightning (9-11-1) an early 2-0 lead before the Bruins responded with three unanswered tallies down the stretch. Boston center Brad Marchand struck on a 2-on-1 with 2:16 left in regulation to lift the Bruins (13-2-2) to a 3-2 win.
“I thought we had a created a lot of momentum on the power play,” Killorn said. “A couple lapses that they capitalized on ended up being the story of the game.”
Killorn’s goal came 8:38 into the first period on the power play. Lightning forward Teddy Purcell tucked a feed past the Bruins’ defense onto the stick of a charging Killorn, who deked around Khudobin for the score. The strike was the rookie’s third career NHL goal and fifth career NHL point.
“[The goal] felt good, especially to get it so quick in the game to kind of help the momentum of the team going forward,” Killorn said. “I’ve played here a few times, and it was nice to score.”
Killorn added that he knew he had “50 or 60” supporters in the Garden stands.
On the first power play of the day, the former Dunster House resident set up camp in front of the Boston net as Tampa Bay’s Steven Stamkos squeezed a close-angle shot past the goal line less than six minutes into the game. Killorn would ink his name on the score sheet three minutes later.
The Bruins evened things up early in the second with two goals spaced 1:17 apart. Killorn was on the ice for the tying tally—a left-wing one-timer from Boston center Richard Peverley.
Killorn’s presence was most felt on special teams Saturday. The rookie displayed offensive firepower not only on the power play but also on the penalty kill.
With less than six minutes left in regulation, Lightning defenseman Brendan Mikkelson was tagged with a four-minute double-minor after a high stick on Bruins’ forward Milan Lucic. More than a minute into the Boston power play, Killorn forced a turnover in the Tampa Bay end and went coast-to-coast with the puck before losing control in the Bruins’ crease as Khudobin covered up for a pad save.
“I was actually trying to do the similar play that I scored on my last goal,” Killorn said. “I lost the puck, but it ended up working out well because it kind of caught [Khudobin] in the five-hole. I thought it was going to sneak through, but he ended up just falling back on it, though.”
Marchand produced the game-winner minutes later. A shorthanded shot from Stamkos bounced off the boards and allowed Boston’s Patrice Bergeron to set up the decisive 2-on-1 in the opposite direction.
In the final minute and a half, Killorn and the Lightning looked for an offensive spark with an extra attacker but failed to produce the equalizer. Killorn finished with four shots, a minus-one rating, and a career-high 19 minutes of ice time.
During his time at Harvard, Killorn led the Crimson in goals during his junior and senior seasons. The government concentrator graduated as a CCM Hockey All-American after posting a tournament-high 10 points during the 2012 ECAC postseason.
Killorn enjoyed particular success in the Beanpot with five goals in eight tournament games, including four in his last four. The night before his return to the Garden, Killorn was in the Bright Hockey Center audience as his old team upset No. 1 Quinnipiac.
“We’re so thrilled and proud of what Alex is doing right now,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said after Harvard’s 2-1 win Friday. “He’s a great kid and really kind of a role model for what we want to represent as a program.”
After Saturday’s game at the Garden, Tampa Bay head coach Guy Boucher berated his squad for unnecessary offensive gambles in the closing minutes. But he had nothing but praise for Killorn’s performance.
“Alex Killorn has been terrific for us every single game,” Boucher said. “He makes it happen; he’s a two-way guy, pays the price offensively and defensively. He’s been terrific for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tough weekend for the No. 14 Harvard’s men’s volleyball team, which saw its six-game winning streak end on Friday. The Crimson only won one set of seven in its road trip against George Mason and Princeton.
Harvard recently completed arguably the best few weeks of play in program history. Most notably, for the first time in program history, Harvard beat No. 9 Penn State in a 3-0 sweep on Feb. 15. But the Crimson lacked the same momentum that brought it into the national rankings.
“I think this weekend was a wake-up call for us,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “It’s disappointing to lose two games. We didn’t feel like we played our best volleyball…. We played two of the strongest teams in the league away at their place, with the crowd and home-court advantage.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 1
It was a packed house in Princeton’s Dillon Gym as Harvard and its rival went head-to-head in a decisive league game. The Tigers (7-3, 5-2 EIVA) were able to clinch at least the second place spot in the EIVA with their victory over the Crimson (9-4, 5-3), which now sits in third place in the conference.
Harvard took the third frame, 25-14, on Saturday, but it wasn’t enough, as Princeton was the first to get to three, taking the fourth set by the same score.
“Today we rallied in the third game and really had a lot of energy and some good moments,” Madden said. “We hit well on offense, [and] our passing was good. We put the pressure on them and made them make mistakes.”
Madden tied with sophomore outside hitter DJ White for most kills in the game for Harvard at nine. Right behind him with the second most kills was freshman starter Brendan Clemens, who had six kills Saturday.
The Tigers’ strength on the defensive end showed in their 22 blocks, led by senior Michael Dye with seven and junior Pat Schwagler who had five.
“We were having a tough time diversifying our offense and finding our rhythm from every position on the court,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.
The Crimson collected a total of 30 digs on Saturday, mostly thanks to junior libero Chris Gibbons, who individually added 12.
Despite having four more digs than the Tigers, Madden felt his team didn’t play its best.
“I felt like our defense, blocking, and serve receive could have been a little bit stronger,” Madden said.
It was a close match in the second and third sets. Harvard’s greatest lead came when it was up 14-10 in the second before Princeton went on a five-point run and then held on tight for a close 25-22 victory. The Tigers sat most of their starters in the third to allow the Crimson to win its only game of the match. After taking a quick breather, Princeton proved resilient in the fourth, establishing a substantial lead after a 6-6 start and securing the match.
GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson’s six-game winning streak came to an end on Friday when the Patriots won in straight sets.
“I thought we played hard,” Lothman said. “But we were missing a little bit of the necessity that the other teams had, particularly [George Mason]. They played like they had to win.”
George Mason (6-7, 4-2) played its strongest set last, carving its greatest lead of 15-7 and forcing head coach Brian Baise to call his first time-out for the Crimson. The Patriots held on to their lead, winning, 25-19, and taking the match.
“They served an incredible game, they had us back on our heels most of the night,” Lothman said. “By the end of the match, we were keeping up with them defensively, but we were still fighting from behind offensively.”
Harvard put up a fight, scoring 20 points in the first and 19 in the second and third frames, but Madden thought his team was not at their offensive best.
Lothman put up 26 assists, the most for Harvard, while George Mason’s senior Javier Perez contributed 34 for the Patriots.
Defense for the Crimson also proved to fall short to George Mason, which had 8.5 team blocks, while Harvard only collected three.
Going forward, Madden knows what his team needs to work on before it faces MIT at home on Tuesday.
“We could definitely work on our serve receive [and] hitting out of system balls; these two things hurt us this weekend,” Madden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting Sunday down by 34 points to rival Princeton, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team could not complete the comeback at the Ivy Championship meet, finishing second in the Ancient Eight. Harvard finished nearly two hundred points ahead of the third-place finisher, Columbia, despite taking home only one win on Sunday when freshman Kendall Crawford won the 200-yard backstroke. The win was one of two Crawford wins on the weekend, and it came with fellow swimmers freshman Danielle Lee placing fourth and senior Caroline Weaver finishing eighth.
 
Coach Stephanie Wriede Morowski said that the team, which set program records in the 1,650 freestyle and the 100 freestyle, had started poorly on the first day of the competition but had done better than Princeton over the weekend.
 
“I thought that the team did great,” Morowski said. “We didn’t get the win, but you can’t define a season by one championship meet. It was a very good team effort in losing to the champions. While Princeton was a better team, I think we outswam them the second two days after a shaky start. However, that’s sports, and we did a really good job overall.”
 
Morowski said that what separated this Harvard team from past squads she had coached was the chemistry in the locker room. Although all the girls on the team are very different, Morowski said that the myriad personalities meshed well together.
 
“I think this team really believed in not only themselves but also in each other,” Morowski said. “You have 20 different personalities, and they found a way to come together. The way this team is, they are going to be great on any different day. It is stuff like a swimmer going to a diver and telling them that I believe in you. We have always had that on teams, but this team took it to a new level, and probably they think they are so different in terms of their personalities that they knew what they needed to do as a team.”
 
This was the eleventh straight meet that the Crimson finished second to the Tigers. Harvard, which is ranked 22nd in the nation, came into the meet 7-0 against fellow Ivy League foes in dual meets but struggled out of the gate.
 
The team won only one race on Thursday, with senior diver Brittany Powell taking home the top spot in the one-meter diving event, but bounced back Friday with nine top-five finishes, highlighted by a 200 medley relay win over Columbia. Junior Sara Li was a consistent force for the Crimson over the weekend, earning a new program record in the 50m freestyle with her 22.46 finish and winning the 200m freestyle the following day. 
 
“It was an awesome weekend on all fronts,” Li said. “The Ivy Championships are really cool, and we went in hoping to win it and although that didn’t happen, we stayed together and we showed incredible heart. I think this made us realize why we are proud to be a part of this team and to be part of Harvard. It was also very motivating for next year for a very young team. We are proud of how everybody supported each other this weekend.”
 
Morowski said that the team got away from what had made it successful during the season on the first day of the meet but by the end of the meet was able to show the technical improvements they had made during the year.
 
“I think that we have very good chemistry, and because [of that], they are able to relax and have fun out there,” Morowski said. “That was something that they forgot on the first day and then got back to again. Technically, I think they have gotten cleaner as the season went on, and every race they have been fixing technical little things that plagued them earlier in the season.”
 
Li said that the team, which she described as very competitive and close, had an intense level of focus all season that led to most of its success. 
 
“This team is really special for sure,” Li said. “The strength of this team is really that we have strong fire in our heart. We had an unbelievable year; we have just rolled into every meet really strong, and basically at every meet we have swam well and it’s been awesome to have those successes and those championships.”

It's common knowledge that Harvard's libraries house the country's second largest book collection. To those of you unimpressed by shelves upon shelves of dusty tomes, these more eccentric acquisitions may pique your interest. We at Flyby have compiled a list of the quirky, the bizarre, and the questionably useful relics found in Harvard's libraries.
A lock of Nathaniel Hawthorne's hair
In a note that accompanies this unusual artifact, Hawthorne's publisher J.T. Field explains: "Here is a golden curl which adorned the head of Nathaniel Hawthorne when he lay a little child in his cradle. It was given to me many years ago by one near and dear to him..." For fans of the author, or anybody with a creepy hair fetish, this relic may tickle your fancy.
Bathing trunks
These articles of clothing circa 1890 to 1930 may have belonged to members of Harvard's early swim or crew teams. Something tells us they're not your brother’s board shorts. Check these out to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of men's aquatic fashion.
Le Whif Breathable Chocolate
In 2009, Professor David A. Edwards developed Le Whif, canisters that contain tiny particles of chocolate that can be inhaled. By "whiffing" these particles, you are able to taste chocolate without actually acquiring the calories that usually accompany the sweet treat. The canisters come in flavors such as chocolate raspberry and chocolate mint. Unfortunately, the "whiffable" chocolate cannot be sampled in the library. Le womp.
Musket balls from the Revolutionary War
These incendiary items date from 1775, when Continental soldiers were housed at Harvard in Mass Hall, Hollis, Stoughton, and Holden Chapel. While Hollis Hall was being remodeled in the late 1950s, five gray musket balls, thought to date from the Revolutionary War, were found between the floorboards in the hall. Please do not use checking out these as an excuse to "bomb" your next exam.
Brick from Widener Library
One of the collection's more mundane items is a brick that blew off of Widener during a storm in 1989. While we at Flyby are not quite certain of the brick’s utility, perhaps it would be useful to reflect on some existential questions. If a brick falls off Widener during a storm, will anybody hear it?
