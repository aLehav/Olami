After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers recently linked a symptom of autism with the malfunction of GABA signaling pathways, discovering the first proven connection between autism and a specific neurotransmitter in humans.
Caroline E. Robertson, a Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows,  led the study, which the journal “Current Biology” published on Dec. 17.
Robertson’s study focuses on GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter that prevents neurons from reacting to sensory information. Based on clinical observations, scientists have for years theorized that people with autism experience dysfunctionality in their inhibitory systems—the part of the human nervous system that slows down or stops the excitation of neurons. In particular, scientists have postulated that GABA plays a role in autism—some animal studies have suggested a relationship—but no human testing established the relationship before Robertson’s paper, according to Bruce R. Kastin, a neurologist at Massachusetts General’s Lurie Center for Autism who was not involved with the study.
The theory suggests that “there’s too much noise in the [autistic]  brain, as if you were driving in a car and talking, and it made it difficult for the driver to think about where he was going,” said Kastin.“So the idea was that maybe this was because GABA inhibition wasn’t working correctly. So if you could cool things down or calm things down, it would be easier to think.”
For her study, Robertson’s research team compared results of visual and brain imaging tests on a control group of 21 people without autism against a group of 20 individuals with autism.
The researchers first performed a visual processing test on the subjects, showing them a different image in front of each of their eyes. As the brain processes the different visual information into one image, the researchers “track[ed] the strength with which one of the images is suppressed from visual awareness,” Robertson said.
People with autism had more trouble completing this task, and the rate of such visual suppression is a predictor of the behavioral symptoms of autism, Robertson said.
The research team then tried to link visual symptoms to the GABA system and “close the loop in the GABA hypothesis,” Robertson said.
As the participants underwent the visual tests, the researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy, an analytical technique, to measure the concentrations of GABA in the brain.
The results showed that, for the control group, “the more of that inhibitory neurotransmitter [GABA] in the brain, the more they will able to suppress that visual process. But, in the autistic people, that pattern seems altered,” Robertson said.
Robertson emphasized that the results do not indicate that people with autism have lower levels of GABA, but rather that autism may be linked to a “dysfunction in the GABA signaling pathways.".
Although Robertson’s study may not immediately help treat the symptoms of autism, scientists said they hope that the research will heighten understanding of autism.
“I would look at this study as a very exciting first step. Down the line, this type of research could lead to some sort of test or hopefully one day a treatment,” Kastin said.
Robertson said the experiment confirmed clinical observations with empirical evidence. She added that scientists can easily replicate the visual tests in her study, meaning doctors may be able to adapt the tests as a “more objective” diagnostic tool for autism, especially for young children.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 23, 2015, at 8:35 p.m.
The Harvard men’s basketball team roared to a 16-point lead first half lead for the second day in a row, but a day after giving it up by halftime, the Crimson (5-6) never looked back Wednesday, rolling to a 69-51 win over the Auburn Tigers (6-4).
The quick start and a suffocating defensive effort in the second half propelled Harvard to a spot in Friday’s Hawaiian Airlines Diamond Head Classic championship. The Crimson will face the winner of the Oklahoma-Hawaii semifinal scheduled for later Friday night.
“It was the key for us yesterday, and it was the key for us today that we were ready to go,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “In a tournament atmosphere like this where you have been playing games on consecutive days, it is crucial to get out to a good start. I think our defense has been able to help us with that.”
With 16:04 left to play, Auburn senior forward Cinmeon Bowers threw down a Kareem Canty lob to cut the Crimson lead to eight, but it was the closest the Tigers would get as Harvard closed the game on a 24-14 run. Following the Bowers alley-oop, Auburn missed 24 of its final 29 field goal attempts and was held to just 30 percent shooting on the afternoon.
The Tigers looked like a different team than the one that put up 83 points against New Mexico in a quarterfinal yesterday while the Crimson showed no ill effects from a 45-minute dogfight with BYU that concluded less than 22 hours before Wednesday’s tip-off.
“As veterans, we have been in this spot before,” senior forward Patrick Steeves said. “We do this in the Ivy League every weekend, we play Friday night and Saturday night and we have a couple guys who have been in those situations and know what to do.”
For the second day in a row, senior forward Agunwa Okolie held the opposing team’s best player in check. The Ajax, Ontario native held the dynamic Canty to just three points on 1-for-15 shooting. The Auburn junior was averaging nearly 21 points a game entering the contest and gave New Mexico fits a day ago, stuffing the stat sheet en route to 27 points and seven assists.
While its defense overshadowed the offensive effort, Harvard rode timely shooting from a bevy of players to its first double-digit victory since last month’s rout of Bryant. Freshman guard Corey Johnson led the Crimson in scoring with 14 points, including four three-pointers. Captain Evan Cummins had a career-high 13 points, with his 11 in the first half being the difference entering intermission.
“Our balance is always a key for us and is a word we use a lot in this program,” Amaker said. “Balance on the court, balance in our lives, and we really embrace that word. We have been balanced here the last two days.”
Following the under-12 media timeout, with Harvard holding a double-digit lead, Auburn coach Bruce Pearl employed the hack-a-Zena tactic that Columbia headman Kyle Smith utilized last season. Edosomwan had been attracting double teams for much of the afternoon following his 23-point performance in the quarterfinals. The junior’s two makes at the line with 7:16 left to play, coupled with the Tigers’ lack of frontcourt depth, led Auburn to eventually abandon the tactic.
With Canty bricking threes left and right, Bowers and freshman guard Bryce Brown did their best to keep the Tigers in the game. The pair combined for 30 points, but it was not enough. Junior guard Corbin Miller followed up his season-best 17 points against BYU with two treys, while Steeves hit a pair from beyond the arc en route to posting the third double-digit scoring output of his career.
In addition to shutting down Canty, Okolie provided an offensive spark for the second day in a row. The Crimson senior finished the contest with 11 points and six rebounds. In his first three seasons, Okolie averaged just under three points a contest but is averaging 7.7 points in the team’s 11 games this season while continuing to lead the team on the defensive end. Auburn’s 30.2 percent shooting and 51 points are the worst offensive outputs by a Harvard opponent since the team’s matchup with Holy Cross on Nov. 29.
“[Defense is] the number one thing that is part of our identity,” Amaker said. “That is what we preach and teach as part of our program. It’s been a calling card for our program for the last seven or eight years and it’s only really grown. Our players have embraced it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting the season 2-6, the Harvard men’s basketball team has strung together three consecutive wins. Following an overtime win against BYU on Tuesday, Harvard stymied the Auburn offense on Wednesday to come away with a 69-51 win.
With the victory over the Tigers (6-4), the Crimson (5-6) moves on to the Diamond Head Classic championship game on Dec. 25 against the winner of the semifinal matchup between No. 3 Oklahoma and tournament host Hawaii.
YOU CAN’T SPELL HARVARD WITHOUT D
These were the words ESPN announcer Kanoa Leahey used to describe the way Harvard shut down the Tiger offense. Led by senior Agunwa Okolie, Harvard once again able to set the tone of the contest by preventing points in transition and limiting the number of Auburn possessions.
The statistics exhibiting Harvard’s shutdown defense are extensive. The team limited Auburn to just 30 percent shooting on the afternoon, including 6-of-25 shooting from behind the arc. Coming into the game, the Tigers averaged nearly 84 points a game; its 51 points on Wednesday were a season low.
In the waning minutes of the game, as Auburn attempted one last push to narrow the gap, the Tigers missed 17 of their last 18 shots. Even on the easy, uncontested buckets, Auburn struggled, shooting 43 percent from the free throw line.
But the most glaring defensive statistic was the Okolie’s silencing of Auburn junior guard Kareem Canty. Just over 24 hours earlier, Canty dropped 27 points on New Mexico in the Tigers’ first round matchup, and he came in averaging almost 21 points per game. But against Harvard, Canty had just three points on 1-of-15 shooting.
“He’s our best defender and I’m so proud of him because every time he’s had an assignment, he’s had to take on the best offensive player,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s done a magnificent job for us.”
While Auburn appeared fatigued after a close first-round victory New Mexico, the Crimson was able to keep up its pace for a full 40 minutes. The back-to-back games are nothing new for Harvard, players said after, as the Ivy League schedule contains six weeks of back-to-back Friday-Saturday contests. While this is new to the freshman class, it is something the team was prepared for.
“For us freshmen coming up, they teach us a lot of things about this atmosphere coming in, playing back-to-backs,” freshman guard Corey Johnson said. “We just kind of follow their lead and they are doing a great job of showing us the ropes. We prepared well for today, had the scout and came in ready.”
GAINING GROUND
At the beginning of the season, the Crimson was ranked fourth in the Ivy League preseason media poll. In the KenPom rankings, Harvard started the season ranked 169th in the nation.
But after back-to-back wins against top-150 teams, the Crimson has risen in the ranks. Harvard rose 40 spots to 115 this week. Yale still ranks higher at 96th nationally, but both Columbia and Princeton have dropped below the Crimson.
The low ranking was partially because of uncertainty surrounding Amaker's all-freshman backcourt of Tommy McCarthy and Johnson. However, despite still struggling with turnovers, McCarthy and Johnson remain two of the Crimson’s top three scorers. Both rookies are averaging just over nine points per game.
McCarthy struggled against Auburn, tallying two fouls in the first three minutes of the game and coughed up the ball six times and forcing Amaker to go to junior Corbin Miller at the point. But Johnson was a force for the Crimson, downing a team-high 14 points in 38 minutes on the floor.
Against Auburn, the Crimson was able to spread the ball around on the offensive end, with five players scoring in double digits.
“A team effort is the main thing,” senior Patrick Steeves said. “Nobody is worried about shots, nobody is worried about ‘I gotta get mine’. Team wins are the bottom line. It’s the only thing we care about, really.”
While junior Zena Edosomwan has provided consistent offense, averaging just over 13 points per game, senior Evan Cummins has increased his offensive presence under the basket. Known for his passing and defensive skills, Cummins notched a career-high 13 points against the Tigers despite playing only 22 minutes because of foul trouble. Cummins got the scoring started for the Harvard for the second night in a row as he broke the ice with layups against both BYU and Auburn.
“We’ve been much more efficient offensively and that’s allowed our team to get better,” Amaker said. “We have seen the fruits of that labor ever since we went to play at Kansas we have been on a steady climb to improve and it’s really shown the last three or four ballgames.”

Harvard’s “Free & For Sale” Facebook group met its tragic end when it suddenly ceased to exist this November. Students and random people in Cambridge are no longer able to enjoy the benefits of the page, which once boasted thousands of members and sold hundreds of used clothes, mattress pads, and other assorted essentials of college life. In its memory, Flyby has written a eulogy for the beloved group that once was:
I used to spend time on “Free & For Sale” in between long hours of problem sets and Netflix binges. It was an unassuming page, one that was constantly active but whose notifications were never burdensome on my Facebook feed. “Free & For Sale” made me feel like I was part of something, something larger than myself.
When I was having a hard day, I could turn to “Free & For Sale” to look at pictures of random bookshelves, clothes, and accessories that I didn’t want and most certainly didn’t need. It supported me, always guaranteeing me an update, making me feel that my presence on Facebook really mattered. If I wanted to sell something, someone was always there to comment “Interested!” and never message me back.
At the end of the school year, the page was always particularly busy with seniors selling their old televisions or speakers for ridiculously low prices, since with their new consulting jobs they could afford to lose money. During this time, the page gave me purpose: it was a treasure hunt, a magical adventure, a wonderful escape from the stress of finals and an opportunity to buy things that I never knew I needed.
The page lived a long and fruitful life as one whose members came and went as they pleased, and whose items ranged from useless pieces of junk to true gems. But it was much more than a Facebook group. It was a place where one could meet other people, a space where one could interact with thousands of strangers who also wanted to buy that sweater from that person who claimed to go to Harvard. It was a page you could post openly and honestly on, knowing you would probably sometimes receive a response of interest from someone who valued your old crap.
The page died suddenly and unexpectedly in the early hours of a late November morning. It will be greatly missed by everyone who knew the group. It is survived by your House email list, Craigslist, and those weird triangular bulletin boards in the yard.
