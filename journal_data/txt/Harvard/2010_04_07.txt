After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Ilisa Barbash originally planned to make a movie about rural environmentalism, but after three summers in the Montana mountains and over 200 hours of footage, they ended up with one about sheep. In “Sweetgrass,” the husband and wife duo, Visual and Environmental Studies and Anthropology Professor and Associate Curator of Visual Anthropology at the Peabody Museum, respectively, follow hired hands as they bring sheep across the dangerous Absaroka-Beartooth Mountains to graze for the last time.
The result is a both gritty and lyrical. “We never called this film a documentary,” says Castaing-Taylor. “We were filming the last time they would graze in those mountains. But we were also wondering, ‘How could this still be happening in the 21st century United States?’”
“Sweetgrass” opens on April 2nd at the Kendall Square Cinema.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get the idea for “Sweetgrass?”
Ilisa Barbash: When we were professors the University at Boulder, we got an email from friends at NYU who knew someone who was leasing land to the rancher in the film. He had told them, “I am the last guy to ranch like this, and someone should make a film about me.” He would be the last rancher to ranch in the Absaroka-Beartooth Mountains for the summer. The email asked if we had students who might be interested in doing the movie. We said, “No, we’ll do it.”
THC: Why was this going to be his last time?
IB: Because it is hard to do. Two people up there watching sheep—it’s emotionally grueling.
Lucien Castaing-Taylor: Sheep-herders often blame environmentalists for changing patterns for the demand for sheep. But it’s really brute economics. During WWII there was a surge in demand for lamb and wool. That demand dwindled, and there were too many sheep in the states. Since, Americans have been eating less and less lamb. And they wear wool less and less too.
THC: I didn’t explicitly get those facts from the movie. Why did you choose not to give any background information or even narrate the film?
IB: We really wanted people to look at the film and to have a kind of transportive cinematic experience. We didn’t want people sitting in the audience watching journalism. That’s why we held the title card that tells you this is the last time this will happen until the end—so that you are not thinking about it throughout.
LCT: We didn’t want the audience viewing it throughout as a rose-tinted nostalgic spectacle.
IB: I think that there are plenty of spoon-feeding documentaries available. You don’t need to go to a theater to see something like that. This way was more interesting than conveying expository information.
LCT: Well, we don’t live life privy to all the expository information that we might wish to have. When we see fiction, we are not given that information either. Fiction films simulate life as it’s lived through acting and plot. Documentary claims not to be fiction and to therefore privilege human existence. The paradox is, it almost entirely consists of people after the fact telling you about their lives. If you asked me about my life, I would just lie through my teeth. Our aesthetic aspiration was about ambiguity, not about clarity. We didn’t want to give people the sense of reducing the magnitude of people’s lives to an issue.
THC: You talked about the aesthetics of your movie—what kind of film were you filming on?
LCT: It was shot on digital video, not film and not an HD digital camera. My students wouldn’t touch our equipment today—it’s outdated—but it was the best camera we could afford then. I carried the camera on a harness—a big body bracer. That way I could hold the camera at knee level and move with it.
For the sound, we would put small microphones on people, occasionally on the sheep or the horse or the dog. Not so much on the animals—[the microphones] were very expensive and the horse would often break it and so on. That way, while I was filming, I was also listening to people who were a mile and a half away from me
IB: And then we blew up the video to 35mm film.
THC: Walking behind the sheep must have been quite an experience—I imagine that many sheep produce quite a bit of waste.
LCT: Yes. There’s a shot where the sheep go through a town. The municipal authorities had just cleaned the street. 3000 sheep went through and it was just covered with sheep shit afterwards.
THC: You have talked about your film’s relation to ethnography—isn’t filming “the last” of something a common trope in ethnographic films?
LCT: It’s a completely embarrassing cliché. It’s been critically embarrassing for the last 30 years.
IB: It has its roots in the basics of anthropology. Margaret Mead’s “Principles of Visual Anthropology” called for people to go and document disappearing cultures.
LCT: It is often though, that privileged Western observers lament disappearing cultures when they are usually in ways quite oblivious and somehow complicit in the cultural tendencies. For that reason, it has lost any kind of credibility. That is a reason we were interested in it. And although this ended up being the last herd ranched in this way, we also wondered how this could be happening in the 21st century United States.
THC: What did the sheep-herders think of your project?
LCT: They didn’t need any convincing—the ranch owners had invited us to film. There wasn’t any reticence to our presence, but some wariness. The two hired hands [who are much of the film’s focus]—I am good friends with them both.
In many parts of the world there’s a different imagination at work about the environment. The notion of wilderness as space out side realm of human agency is peculiar to America. It’s almost an arrogant conception of nature—it implies we are not natural, just purely cultural. In Europe, there is more of a continuum, a spectrum of human culture and animal-nature relationships. It’s more subtle than either or.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Barack Obama made good on a campaign promise by proposing to open new American waters to drilling for oil and natural gas. However, by promoting fossil-fuel usage and threatening these off-shore ocean ecosystems, he is failing to make good on protecting the environment.
The proposal will open up much of the Eastern seaboard—from Delaware to central Florida—the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as more of Alaska, to drilling. This near-sighted plan endangers the environment while also doing little to advance the United   States’ goal of energy independence. The research necessary to pinpoint tracts of oil and natural gas suitable for drilling is incredibly invasive; for example, the process often disrupts whale migration because of sonar equipment. Such research will likely drag on for 10 to15 years, while destroying precious ecosystems.
Apart from the severe environmental hazards, Obama’s proposal is problematic because of the short-term solution it provides. Experts estimate that the total yield from the new drilling proposal will only provide three years of oil and about two years of natural gas, based on current consumption levels. These are paltry numbers. Nor is this, in fact, really a “solution.” The recovered oil and gas will not be available for many years, and it is possible that once the oil and gas tracts are found, extraction may be prohibitively expensive. In this circumstance, the country would not benefit—perhaps even losing money—and the environmental damage from preliminary research would have occurred needlessly.
Some point to possible political motivations behind Obama’s proposal, suggesting that perhaps it is a move to drum up support from some Republicans and centrist Democrats for a more far-reaching climate change bill. Since the exact contents of the final bill are still unknown, changes will undoubtedly occur during its time in Congress. Therefore, Obama was unwise to make environmentally-damaging drilling concessions so early in the game.  His drilling proposal, more modest than many of these individuals would like, may not be enough to win votes in the end.
While some believe that Obama’s proposal could free the country from dependence on foreign oil, The United States’ oil and gas reserves simply do not compare to the Middle East’s. Even suggesting that they do is a political façade. Rather than delude Americans into thinking that two to three years of (potentially forbiddingly expensive) oil and gas aids the energy crisis, Obama needs to focus on greater investment in sustainable, alternative energy solutions. The real problem lies in the United States’s heavy reliance on oil and fossil fuels, which generate greenhouse gases and particulate matter, which, in turn, cause serious health issues like asthma.
From an economic perspective, some may go so far as to argue that this oil and natural gas drilling will create jobs, in a time when many Americans are out of work. However, the administration would do much better to focus on generating green jobs. Promoting employment in the sustainability sector not only works to mitigate climate change but also provides workers with greater long-term job possibilities than a career on an oil rig.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may never rain in California, but it sure does in Boston. Throughout the winter, it was easy to complain about the biting winds and frigid temperatures. “Those Stanford students are so lucky,” we muse as we trudge through the slush to class.
But what would happen if the average day in Cambridge was 75 degrees and mostly sunny? Disaster, that’s what. The temptation to walk along the river or play tennis for a couple hours might win out over spending the day studying in Lamont uninterrupted. As opposed to the inches of slush that usually accompany days at Harvard and keep us inside where we can focus on work, the sun might trick us into taking a break. A trip to Berryline to break up work on a paper would completely derail your train of thought. Aside from the fifteen minutes you would waste walking to and from the store, it would take you at least five minutes to get back into work mode, and you’d even have to root through your bag to find your ID to swipe back into Lamont. Such massive amounts of disruption are hardly worth the fro-yo.
And just think about the effort we would have to put into our clothing choices if we had to plan for sun year-round. When it will not break 20 degrees, it’s easy to pile on layers of sweatshirts and jackets before you head out the door. Yet when the forecast is more optimistic, girls take the time to match their summer dresses with appropriate spring jackets. Boys are forced to pick out new shorts and change their shirts, as there are no puffy coats to cover the stains or smell on the t-shirt they have been wearing for the past two days. All of this is an enormously frivolous waste of time.
Imagine if we had to put this extra effort into our appearances every day of the week. We would lose valuable hours that could otherwise be spent volunteering, writing papers, or curing cancer. In reality, we are the lucky ones. Sunshine and balmy temperatures are more detrimental to Harvard students than alcohol and dating could ever be. Living in New England thankfully doesn’t give us the option of trading excellence for a good tan.
Picture a rainy Saturday night with temperatures just above freezing. You were planning on going out, but by the time you walked across campus you would not only be soaked but shivering as well. To avoid this potentially traumatic experience, you decide to stay in and work on that problem set you had been putting off all week. End result: one completed problem set and one less awkward drunken hookup.
So we pale and dry-skinned Harvard students may not be able to boast a vacation-like climate, but we can rejoice in knowing that because of the bad weather in Cambridge we ultimately grow closer to the superhuman individuals we expect ourselves to become. Each dismal day takes us farther down the path of success, eliminating distractions and thankfully giving us no option but to concentrate on our studies. The occasional cheery days that Cambridge does enjoy are not enough to distract us from our main purpose at Harvard—to become wealthy future world leaders and save people from poverty and other injustices across the globe.
Although each nice day sporadically spaced amidst rain and cool weather might make us wonder what we’re missing, the weather at Harvard is really the best thing for us. October through April showers bring perfect overachievers—along with May flowers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Scott Brown’s election didn’t jettison the notion that the Republican electoral ship had sunk after the 2008 election, the current political climate certainly has. Despite their recent legislative victory in the health-care battle, the Democrats still stand to lose significant ground in the midterm elections. Although punishing sitting presidents with Congressional losses is ingrained in the American political tradition, recent polls suggest that voters may put an unusually severe dent in the Democrats’ current congressional majority. As the leader of his party, President Obama must take it upon himself to stop the bleeding. If he wants to protect Congressional Democrats in November, Obama must better recast his health-care pitch and correct misconceptions about his handling of the financial crisis to frame his presidency as responsive and effective.
Despite the conclusion of the yearlong debate and decades-old struggle of reforming health care, Obama finds himself fighting an uphill battle against a tide of Republican vitriol and popular ambivalence. But even with a majority of Americans still against the new health-care law, Obama must read between the numbers and figure out how to best sell this plan to the public. A comprehensive survey conducted by the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll illuminates possible pitches the president could effectively make to the public.
For instance, despite its mixed popularity, Americans overwhelmingly prefer some reform to no reform at all. Should Obama seize upon this point, he would expose the Republicans as the “party of no” and highlight the Democrats as the enablers of the public will. By casting his legislative victory as a response to popular clamoring for reform, Obama would aid the reelection bids of those Democrats whose yea votes now threaten their seats in November.
The financial sector is another region where Obama’s failure to advertise has cost him popularity points and political cache. Though the financial meltdown dominated global conversation for months, it has recently faded into the background of political discourse. Through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75’s aggressive policies, and the Obama administration’s bold moves, the financial system has been resuscitated to a quasi-functional state, all to the negligence of the media and resultant ignorance of the general public.
Although increased liquidity and bank recapitalization have led to a much more sound and secure financial system, Obama has yet to publicize these developments, to his own detriment. Just a year ago, there were talks of a potential second Great Depression, but the aggressive actions taken by the Fed and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have led financial analyst Richard Bove to conclude that “U.S. banks now have more capital as a percentage of assets than in any year since 1935.” Nevertheless, the perception remains that Washington is making all the wrong moves; critics on the left suspect an incestuous relationship between Wall Street and Capitol Hill and those on the right decry a socialist takeover of the financial system. Lost in this maelstrom of punditry is the fact that the government has recouped most of its bailout money and divested its involvement in banking. Obama must argue before the American public that his administration averted the country from financial disaster. If voters still believe that the government failed in handling this crisis by November, Obama will have only himself to blame, and Congressional Democrats will suffer.
Once left for dead, even by some of its leaders, the Republican Party has come roaring back into competition. The stakes are high in November; national opinion surveys show a two-percentage point GOP edge, and some polls even suggest that the Republicans could retake the Senate. Obama’s approval ratings have fallen by 24 percent in less than a year, in spite of having achieved his top legislative priority and overseeing a successful stabilization of the banking industry. Yes, the American people do tend to check their leaders by issuing them losses in midterm elections, but Obama’s performance doesn’t merit the dramatic backlash 2010 is shaping up to be.
To save his party from an embarrassing defeat in November, therefore, Obama must remove himself from the realm of public policy and reenter the sphere of politics that won him the presidency. He should reframe how he pitches the health-care law and correct the myriad misconceptions about the government’s handling of the financial crisis. Obama can learn a lesson from his candidate self; it was that Obama, after all, who, despite his paucity of qualifications, won the presidency with shrewd political positioning and image promotion. President Obama must rediscover his political acumen soon for the sake of his party. Otherwise, his successes will be for naught, as his governing coalition withers away come election day.

Now that health-care reform has passed—and financial reform is moving along—the Senate’s fight over cap-and-trade legislation is just around the corner. Yet obscured in the debate is the fact that the U.S. already has a law giving the Environmental Protection Agency the responsibility to regulate greenhouse emissions. It’s called the Clean Air Act, and it’s been around since 1963.
Under the current version of the act, which has been amended significantly since passage, the EPA is required to control “any air pollutant” emanating from a motor vehicle that contributes to “air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” Enforcing this is not optional; indeed, the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, given their contribution to climate change. To comply, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling car emissions that will require car companies’ fleets to average 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Additional regulations controlling emissions from power plants are expected shortly.
As one would expect, this approach has provoked its share of grievances. Senator Lisa Murkowski is attempting to pass a resolution that would strip the EPA of its authority to regulate greenhouse gasses. The House and President Obama will likely sink the effort, but Murkowski has a kernel of a point. EPA regulation is a fairly unsubtle way of regulating emissions; it fails to put a price on emissions, for one, which a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade system would both do. All else being equal, a more complex and carefully crafted emissions control law would be preferable.
But the Senate seems to have little interest in passing such a law. Although the Waxman-Markey cap and trade bill passed the House last summer, the equivalent proposal’s sponsors in the Senate—John Kerry and Barbara Boxer—are still trying to negotiate a package capable of breaking a filibuster. Republican Lindsey Graham, who has been talking with Kerry and Boxer about cap and trade, has said that he thinks a bill will be hard to pass after the health- care battle, and his colleague Olympia Snowe, the most liberal Republican in the Senate, agrees. What’s more, the content of the Senate bill is likely to be a disappointment. From the looks of it now, the bill will not even have a real cap on carbon emissions, only limiting them for utilities and focusing instead on providing funds for alternative energy development.
There does exist an alternative bill, proposed by Senator Maria Cantwell, which would auction off a certain number of emissions permits and distribute the proceeds to households to compensate for higher energy costs. While certainly better on policy terms than what the Kerry-Boxer bill looks to be—not least because Cantwell’s bill appears capable of passing through budget reconciliation processes that require only 50 votes plus the vice president—the chances for passage are questionable. There are enough Democratic Senators from coal-producing or manufacturing-heavy states to make gaining 50 votes seem questionable, and while Cantwell does have a Republican cosponsor in Susan Collins, it’s doubtful that GOP support will stick. There was considerable Republican enthusiasm about the Healthy Americans Act, an alternative health-care reform proposal spearheaded by Senator Ron Wyden, but its GOP cosponsors abandoned many of its provisions—such as a mandate requiring individuals buy insurance—when the health-care reform debate got fully underway. When push comes to shove, I doubt Collins and other Republicans would be willing to actually vote for a proposal as robust as Cantwell’s.
Although these Senate efforts should by no means be abandoned, the Obama administration should start looking for other ways to implement carbon pricing and other greenhouse gas regulations. The Columbia  Law School’s Center for Climate Change Law has proposed one of the more promising ideas: have the EPA set up a cap-and-trade system on its own.
The details are technical, but the Clean Air Act, in addition to mandating the regulation of greenhouse gases from cars and power plants, allows the EPA to regulate emissions that are endangering public health in foreign countries. Specifically, it allows the EPA to direct states to set greenhouse emissions caps and encourages the states to set up a system among themselves whereby allowances granted one state can be traded for those in another. The effect would be a cap-and-trade system, albeit a messy one.
Of course, a permanent solution, along the lines of Kerry and Boxer’s bill or Cantwell’s, is still needed. EPA regulations can be overturned by new administrations, and the media reaction to implementing restrictions of this magnitude without Congressional input would be fiery, to say the least. But allowing climate change to continue apace while the Senate dithers is not an option. Letting the EPA take over cap-and-trade may be messy, but it’s certainly preferable to inaction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The incoming Eliot House Masters—Life Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton and educational consultant Gail A. O’Keefe—may be new to leading a House, but they already have their share of experience with House life.
Their daughter, Emily L. Melton ’09, was Quincy House Committee chair and introduced her parents to the quirks of Harvard’s House system.
The couple knows that perennial House debates revolve around stein club locations, planning for formals, and housing day t-shirt designs—they even have former Quincy housing day t-shirts in their home.
With this background, the two scientists eagerly anticipate embedding themselves in House culture, bringing with them their passion for their profession and their extensive experience with undergraduates.
SMOOTH SAILING
Melton and O’Keefe say they plan on enthusiastically and easily embracing House life.
“I think it will be very easy to fit into the social patterns there,” O’Keefe says.
The two say they plan to spend much of their time in the Eliot dining hall.
O’Keefe says she is a night owl but her husband is an early bird, so while she will chat with undergraduates in the dining hall at 1 a.m., he will cruise through the dining hall at 5:30 a.m.
Much of their confidence is due to their trust in the House staff and the foundation provided by outgoing Masters Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted, Melton says.
More broadly, the couple’s goal is to create a community where undergraduates can feel comfortable sharing their concerns with the couple, a culture rarely attainable in classes and office hours.
But despite their aplomb, dealing with administrative or disciplinary issues may be more difficult, they both acknowledge.
Still, Melton jokes that his biggest challenge will be learning the Eliot song.
“Gail knows I’m a terrible singer,” he quips.
BIOLOGICAL BACKGROUNDS
While singing may not be their forte, Melton and O’Keefe bring strong scientific backgrounds that complement each other’s areas of expertise. O’Keefe frames their studies as opposites, although both lie within the realm of biology.
While he studies small systems on the molecular level, she focuses on examining organisms, like bugs and birds.
“You’ll see we’re on opposite ends of the spectrum,” O’Keefe says. “We’re complementary.”
Born in Connecticut, O’Keefe did not stray far from home during her undergraduate years, majoring in Biology at the University of Connecticut with a focus on entomology, the study of insects. She also received her M.A. in Applied Developmental and Educational Psychology from Boston College.
Likewise, her husband, a Chicago native, majored in Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He continued his studies as a Marshall Scholar at Cambridge University, receiving a B.A. in History and Philosophy of Science and a Ph.D. in molecular biology.
Harvard’s House system mirrors Cambridge University’s College system, where students are divided into 31 Colleges where they live, eat, and socialize.
But Melton, a member of Cambridge’s Trinity College, says he prefers Harvard’s newer House system to the more formal Cambridge system, where students were required to wear full gowns in order to attend meals.
“This is much less formal and much more interactive,” he says of the Houses.
ENERGIZED EXCHANGES
The informal interactions Melton sees in the Houses are similar to the interactions Melton says he has in his laboratory, where undergraduates conduct cutting-edge research on stem cells alongside graduate students and faculty.
Although Melton is now known for his study of the pancreas and stem cells, he began his career examining frogs and embryonic development.
But when his son Sam was diagnosed with Type I diabetes, Melton entirely switched his focus from frogs to mammals, specifically studying the pancreas and diabetes.
Melton has extensive experience working with students in his laboratory, from thesis advising to writing medical school recommendations. He also teaches mainly undergraduate courses, including the popular bioethics course co-listed as Government 1093 and Life Sciences 60, which he co-teaches with Harvard Professor Michael J. Sandel, well-known for teaching Moral Reasoning 22: “Justice.”
“The undergraduates are so full of energy and excited about new things,” Melton says. “I find myself energized.”
Melton’s familiarity with students has given him a deep understanding of even some of the minute details of undergraduate life—for example, he has noticed that some students are completely free and relaxed during reading period, while others disappear and retreat to the libraries.
Their new roles as House Masters will enable the couple to further connect with the youngest students at Harvard—and they can’t wait to begin.
“When we started we liked the idea, but now that we’ve been asked to do it, September seems a long time away,” Melton says.

In honor of Gaypril—a month dedicated to celebrating LGBT awareness—co-chair of the Harvard Queer Students and Allies Marco Chan ’11 stood outside the science center in high heels and a dress, the flowing tendrils of an ebony wig cascading down his back. When he walked into class after tabling, his professor had difficulty tearing his eyes from the young man in women’s clothes, and ended up returning to the topic of drag throughout that day’s class.
“That’s the beauty of having the month of Gaypril,” said Chan. “It’s about getting people talking and having fun at the same time.”
As many college campuses dedicate the month of April to celebrating LGBT pride, QSA has collaborated with LGBT groups at the Harvard graduate schools to dedicate a month to raising visibility for the queer community.
“Gaypril being a queer history month of sorts is really important to highlight the history of a group of people who are often neglected in the textbooks,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer who helped organize some of the month’s events. He added that Gaypril will allow people inside and outside the LGBT community to examine issues that are often inadequately addressed.
“Opportunities like this serve a crucial function by situating our community in a broader historical and cultural landscape,” he said.
Erika J. Rickard, co-president of Harvard Law School’s LGBT group HLS Lambda, also touched on the importance of raising the profile of a group that has been historically silenced.
In the ’60s and ’70s, “people with an outsider status were angry about not being included and they were seeking not just inclusion, but visibility,” Rickard said.
She added that the next step is to bring LGBT issues more prominently into the public eye.
Chan said that Gaypril’s programming emphasizes creating connections between the LGBT community and other groups.
“We’re hoping to build awareness around all the very diverse issues of the queer community by offering the biggest plate of queer-related programming and information that is possible,” he said.
With the goal of highlighting the intersection of queer and other minority issues, QSA and LGBT groups in Harvard graduate schools have worked together to organize events that range from social to political to playful.
Scheduled events include a movie screening about Native American perspectives on LGBT issues, a conference on human rights and gay rights organized by McCarthy, and a panel on LGBT family planning. Others will focus on the fight for political rights, particularly the Day of Silence demonstration later this month, in which members of the queer community will wear duct tape across their mouths to call attention to discrimination and harassment against LGBT people.
“There are still hate crimes, gay people discharged from the military, and conservatives against same-sex marriage and gender equality,” said QSA political co-chair Emma Q. Wang ’12. The first step on the road to acceptance, she said, is creating awareness.
“By doing away with ignorance and seriously contemplating LGBT issues we’re ultimately building unity, for social purposes as well as political,” Wang said.
The social side of Gaypril is also an integral area of programming, and many students especially anticipate Drag Night.
“It’s fun!” said Chan. “The tone of the evening is a fun way to put different ideas of gender and performance into question, and to have the experience of dressing up and participating instead of just going to a lecture or a video or taking notes.”
McCarthy said that in addition to serving the social side of the LGBT community, the month must address the ongoing role of LGBT advocacy.
“Our community is still in the process of constructing our historical narrative, and I don’t think it’s ever going to be something that’s finished,” said McCarthy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students will be asked to pre-register for courses beginning next spring using a new online course planning tool, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced at yesterday’s Faculty Meeting.
Pre-registration—a non-binding indication of the courses a student plans to take—is intended to ameliorate some of the “predictable unpredictability” that currently plagues the process of assigning rooms, hiring teaching fellows, and placing book orders for courses, Harris said.
Students will indicate their course selections for the upcoming semester online through the existing Plan of Study tool, which was introduced this year in time for members of the sophomore class to declare their concentrations and indicate whether they plan to fulfill Core or Gen Ed requirements.
“Adults have difficulty navigating through this,” Harris said, as the faculty members looked through a printout of screenshots of the Web site, which links to the undergraduate Advising Network Portal, “but sophomores have no difficulty.”
Harris said that although an individual’s course selections are likely to change between pre-registration and Study Card day, the predicted class size tends to be within 5 percent of actual enrollment numbers—not substantial enough to affect section sizes.
Harris also called upon the Faculty to support the initiative by activating their course Web sites prior to the pre-registration date, which he tentatively set for November.
Harris said that the current unpredictable nature of class sizes has led the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to overspend on books, TFs and TAs, to the tune of over $1 million last year.
FAS has long sought to reduce these inefficiencies. Two years ago, administrators began working with pre-semester estimates to reduce the number of TFs hired at the last minute to accommodate larger-than-expected classes. According to Harris, TFs who are hired after the semester has begun are often among the lowest rated in the Q Guide.
And last spring, FAS announced that it would cut up to 10 percent of section leader positions for the fall 2009 semester by adhering more closely to the target of 18-person sections.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The issue of financial conflicts of interest among faculty was also raised at yesterday’s meeting, as Harvard moves towards a University-wide policy in the face of what Vice Provost for Research David Korn ’54 described as increased financial scrutiny.
Korn responded to questions regarding the current draft of the new policy, formulated by a committee chaired by Korn over the last year.
The policy—in its 11th draft—focuses on protocol regarding relationships with outside parties when receiving financial support, primarily from federal funding. Korn estimated that faculty in the sciences will receive as much as $700 million in research funding next year, mostly from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.
While each of Harvard’s schools currently have its own policies regarding financial conflicts of interest, Korn said that the committee chose to follow Stanford University’s lead and adopt a standardized policy across the entire University that still leaves room for flexibility on a school level.
English Department Chair James T. Engell ’73—who acknowledged that members of his humanities department were “relatively innocent of many of these financial conflicts of interest”—expressed concern that the wording of the draft was imprecise and left much room for interpretation.
But Korn said that more specific guidelines would develop through precedents and reaffirmed the importance of formulating a University policy, rather than allowing the government to dictate conflict of interest policy, a concern that has arisen in the past.
“I will assure you that it’s a lot better for us to regulate ourselves than to ask the government to do it for us,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At yesterday’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, University President Drew G. Faust revealed her weak spot in Latin.
While presenting honorary degrees to newly tenured members of FAS who had not graduated from Harvard—a practice dating back to 1942—Faust began to read aloud a traditional Latin motto from a piece of paper.
“Ut in gre...” she began, hesitating as she turned to Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas. Faust then proceeded to deliver the full translation of the traditional welcome, which reads, "in order that he/she may be counted among our flock," and Thomas approved the translation.
“I haven’t had Latin since eighth grade,” Faust admitted.
Eleven tenured professors from across FAS were formally introduced to the Faculty, though seven of the new Harvard degree holders had formerly been untenured professors at the University.
Faust said that the seven promotions from within were a testament to the “vibrancy of our tenure track system.”
“So let’s have a round of applause for that,” she added.
REACCREDITING HARVARD
Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith had good news to deliver at yesterday’s meeting: Harvard is qualified to grant degrees as an academic institution.
Smith was not stating the obvious, but announcing that the New England Association of Schools and Colleges had officially reaccredited Harvard.
“I am pleased to say that Harvard has successfully been reaccredited,” Smith said. “Good news for us.”
Reaccreditation is a voluntary process in which universities and colleges demonstrate to the public that they meet the standards in areas like academic programs and financial resources. Harvard, which had its last comprehensive review in 1997, undergoes the peer-review process every decade.
The review committee—a group of officials from peer institutions that is led by Georgetown President John J. DeGioia—spent a year examining various aspects of the University and interviewing faculty, staff, and students.
Harvard formulated a 141-page “self-study report” detailing the University’s administrative structure, institutional history, recent changes, and current challenges.
Smith named several Harvard administrators who played important roles in the reaccreditation process, thanking those “who helped us achieve this successful outcome.”
WOW-ING THE FACULTY
The Faculty meeting progressed with uncharacteristic speed and occupied less than half of its usual two-hour timeframe.
In spite of the meeting’s efficient pace, one particular member of the Faculty—which has been working on developing the budget for the fiscal year ending in June 2011—found himself catching up on some much-needed shut-eye.
Smith, who refrained from commenting on the ongoing budgeting process at yesterday’s meeting, found a moment to close his eyes, as Vice Provost for Research David Korn responded to questions about the possibility of a new financial conflict of interest policy.
When Faust concluded the meeting shortly after, a surprised “wow” could be heard from across the room.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 11, 2010
An earlier version of the April 7 news article "Faust Asks For Help in Classics" incorrectly stated that Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas "provided the full translation" of a Latin phrase. In fact, Thomas simply approved of University President Drew G. Faust's translation and did not actually provide a translation, according to Thomas.

In the quest to achieve meaningful social change in American cities, failures are inevitable—and even necessary—said Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitchell J. Landrieu and several other panelists at a discussion of social innovation at the Institute of Politics yesterday.
“I guess that’s going to fall on mayors to say that you are going to be willing to take a hit in the public eye if something doesn’t work,” said Landrieu, who is also mayor-elect of New Orleans. “When it gets to be a bad thing to fail, that’s when we’re going to stop innovating.”
Landrieu joined Deputy Mayor of New York City Linda I. Gibbs, Senior Advisor for Social Innovation in the White House Michele Jolin, and President of the United Negro College Fund Michael L. Lomax in a panel moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor Stephen Goldsmith.
Gibbs said she uses this model of risk-taking in her work, adding that of the 40 pilot programs begun under New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s $200 million social innovation fund, six have been integrated into the budget, while eight or nine have been retired.
But the political unpopularity of failed programs funded by tax dollars presents a major obstacle to change, according to Lomax.
Panelists at last night’s event, part of this semester’s Public Service Week at the Kennedy School, also emphasized that organizations must both produce concrete results and energize citizens in order to create long-term programs.
“People on the ground level need to not be OK with the status quo if we’re going to institutionalize innovation,” Lomax said. “What I worry about the social innovators is that they’re not deeply rooted in the communities in which they serve,”
Max A. Noonan-Pomada, who works at a Boston elementary school through the AmeriCorps program City Year, said that he was “reinvigorated” by the panelists’ commitment to social change.
“We’re on the super ground level all day,” Noonan-Pomada said. “It can feel like you’re doing the work without people at the top championing your cause.”
But Anthony R. Britt ’10 said he worries that the panelists’ focus on new innovations takes their attention away from older programs that have proven successful such as Teach for America, where Britt will work next year.
Last night’s panel, co-sponsored by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, is the final product of two years of sustained discussion among social innovators organized by Goldsmith and the Kennedy School. These conversations have also contributed to Goldsmith’s book “The Power of Social Innovation,” released this week.

Facing a $3.7 million deficit in Fiscal Year 2011, the Cambridge Public School Committee is planning to cut administrative staffers, according to the Cambridge Public School System’s proposed budget.
The School Committee voted unanimously to refer the budget for the next fiscal year to the City Council at yesterday’s meeting.
“This budget was crafted in a time of fiscal constraint,” said Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young.
The budget proposal calls for an appending level—the amount the city manager allocates for the public schools—of $137.5 million, which represents an increase of $3.7 million over Fiscal Year 2010. Salaries comprise around 77.5 percent, or about $107 million, of the sum.
The major forces driving budgetary increases each year are personnel costs—including salary and benefits increases—the cost of out-of-district tuitions, and the cost of transportation.
In an attempt to continue to strengthen Cambridge’s education system while also accounting for the fiscal constraint, the budget recommends reorganizing the central administration, including eliminating some administrative support jobs, such as the technical assistant specialist and the coordinator of cooperative education.
The school system also plans to cut a handful of teaching aides working in grades 1-8.
“It is my hope that as we look forward, that these dark days don’t last,” said Young.
Administrative reorganization, which will save the school system about $1.2 million, is the main way the budget recommends to reducing costs. The district plans to perform a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of administrative and operational departments.
“We are looking at ways, while the number of people in the Central Administration is lowered, we can create positions with higher skill levels,” said Claire B. Spinner, chief financial officer of the Cambridge Public Schools.
Young said he hopes the administrative cutback will shed light on why Cambridge spends more per pupil than the average Mass. school system.
Aside from personnel, the school system will also be making other cutbacks, such as reducing the number of ads it places in The Boston Globe, cutting back the material and professional development budgets, and eliminating the Jump Start Program. Each school will also experience a reduction in its building-based accounts and general materials budget.
Despite the major cutbacks, the school system plans to increase the funds dedicated to student achievement, special education, and middle grades, among others.
This budget will be discussed in a City Council budget hearing on May 19.

Reshuffling at Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s endowment, continued last month with the resignation of bond trader Mitch Livstone, who has left Harvard for a Boston-based fund.
Livstone’s resignation was announced in an internal e-mail in the middle of last month, but his resignation was not made public until last week when Bloomberg obtained a copy of the e-mail.
After a three-year stint at HMC, Livstone has departed for Geode Capital Management’s institutional investment arm, which manages $81 billion.
Livstone leaves HMC at a time when media reports indicate that its director, Jane L. Mendillo, has carried out a campaign to partly restructure the organization after Harvard’s endowment plummeted 27.3 percent during the 2009 fiscal year.
Requests to Livstone for comment yesterday were not returned.
In a speech earlier this year, Mendillo said she had worked to adopt a more sophisticated risk management strategy in the University portfolio and allocate a larger percentage of its investments to cash holdings.
Last year, when markets dropped precipitously, many institutions—including Harvard—reportedly scrambled for cash to meet their short term obligations.
According to Bloomberg, Livstone had reported to Marc Seidner, the former head of HMC’s U.S. fixed-income investment group, who has since left for Pacific Management Company (PIMCO).
PIMCO is headed by Mohammed El-Arian, a former director of HMC, whose short-lived tenure managing Harvard’s endowment saw stellar returns during the boom years of 2005-2007.
When he left in 2007, Harvard’s endowment was valued at $34.9 billion.
HMC has seen its staff reshuffled several times over the last decade. Last February, the organization announced that it would lay off 50 staffers in an effort to “rebalance to company” to better suit Harvard’s new portfolio, and in 2005, former HMC director Jack R. Meyer left the company with approximately a third of his staff to start his own hedge-fund after vocal protests from alumni over HMC compensation levels.

After months of planning, Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young presented a short-term action plan for the system’s middle schools at yesterday’s Cambridge Public Schools Committee meeting.
The action plan aims to close the achievement gaps in Cambridge middle school students by evaluating teachers’ performances and encouraging collaboration between educators.
“The enemy is low expectations,” Young said, tying the problems middle schools have been facing to issues with the overall achievement of students.
Young plans to close the achievement gap by focusing on Hispanic, low income, African American/Black, and SPED students, while continuing to encourage White and Asian students, who are currently performing better than the district average.
“Any child should have the opportunity to be challenged and supported,” Young said.
The plans aims to improve the performances of local educators by developing a culture of collaboration and evaluation.
Young recommended expanding the Cambridge Leadership Network to include curriculum coordinators, assistant principals, and deans of students.
“The hallmark of this plan is teacher and coach collaboration,” said Barbara J. Allen, executive director of human resources for the Cambridge Public Schools.
This increased collaboration will include setting common expectations and benchmarks, exploring effective teaching practices, and planning lessons cooperatively.
The plan also emphasizes the need to align the curriculum in all the middle schools and better organize the transition between middle and high schools to level the disparities between the quality of education at the different middle schools.
These changes are a small step in Young’s larger plan to significantly improve Cambridge’s public school system.
The School Committee will formally discuss Young’s proposal at its May 4 meeting.

Cornell’s Steve Donahue will be the new men’s basketball coach at Boston College, according to multiple sources.
Jeff Goodman of FoxSports.com first reported this morning that Donahue, who during a ten-year tenure in Ithaca had taken the Big Red to three consecutive NCAA tournaments—including the Sweet 16 this year—was chosen to replace Al Skinner at BC.
Skinner’s former assistants Ed Cooley, now coaching at Fairfield, and Bill Coen, the coach at Northeastern, were thought to be the other finalists for the job.
BC will hold a press conference to introduce Donahue tomorrow afternoon. He had interviewed with athletic director Gene DeFilippo last Wednesday and was scheduled to meet with the university president today.
Cornell senior Jon Jaques acknowledged the news, stating on Twitter: “The Captain is moving on...sad day for Cornell basketball, but BC could not have picked a better man for the job.”
And according to Andy Katz of ESPN, “Donahue had contacted coaches about joining his staff with the Eagles, including at least one other Ivy League head coach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 80 degrees out. The  sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and Frisbees have become a constant  disturbance in the Yard. It must be…early April?
Spring has sprung in more ways  than one, as league play began this weekend for the Ivy diamond sports.  We’ve got upsets, no-hitters, and a couple of new powers making a  splash. Let’s take a spin around the Ancient Eight.
BASEBALL
As Ivy play began this weekend  with inter-divisional play, there were many winners, and then there  was Yale. The only baseball squad to enter the conference season with  a winning record faltered in the first days of Ancient Eight baseball,  dropping four games to Penn and Columbia.
The Quakers and Lions made  out best in the opening weekend, coming away with 3-1 records. The other  five Ivy schools, including Harvard, split the first four games down  the middle.
SOFTBALL
Proving that preseason play  is not at all indicative of conference performance, Penn—who came  into the week with the worst record of any Ivy team—is now the only  unbeaten squad. The Quakers, riding junior Taylor Tieman’s four wins,  went 6-0 last week, including sweeps of Yale and Brown.
Harvard’s the early leader  in the North Division after sweeping Princeton—highlighted by a no-hitter  from sophomore Rachel Brown—and splitting with defending champ Cornell.
MEN’S LACROSSE
And then there was one. Princeton  now sits alone atop the conference standings as the only undefeated  team left after it eked out a 9-7 win over Yale in New Haven on Saturday.  The Tigers earned the top spot after Cornell—last year’s national  runner-up—faltered against Dartmouth at the New England Lacrosse Classic  at Gillette Stadium. The Big Green got its first Ivy win in a big way,  topping the Big Red by an 8-6 count.
Harvard took a break from the  conference schedule, but it wasn’t a pleasant one. The Crimson was  routed by Duke, 14-5, in front of a record crowd at home on Friday night,  and it will try to get back on track Saturday at Cornell.
WOMEN’S LACROSSE
Dartmouth continued to cement  its status as a new Ivy power, besting Boston University and Brown last  week to move to 7-1 overall and 3-0 in conference. But despite falling  to No. 2 Maryland on Friday, Penn’s not going anywhere—sitting pretty  atop the standings at 4-0.
Like its male counterpart,  the Harvard squad had a disappointing weekend, falling to Yale, 17-13,  on Saturday before dropping a contest at No. 5 Virginia last night.  The Crimson women have this weekend off and have just three games to  try to move up from sixth into one of the four postseason tournament  spots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have been the team’s first game of the season in Cambridge, but home field advantage wasn’t enough to get the Harvard baseball team a win at O’Donnell Field yesterday afternoon.
In a game marked by defensive highs and lows, as well as strong pitching by both sides, the Crimson (8-15, 2-2 Ivy) fell 5-0 to Bryant (10-13, 2-2 NEC) in its season’s home opener.
While midweek games are often challenging enough on their own, Harvard faced an even bigger test when it went up against one of the Bulldog’s best hurlers.
“We’re thinking, ‘Who’s this guy on a Tuesday?’” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “[It] turns out he’s one of their top guys.”
Bryant senior starter Eric Polvani pitched over seven innings of play and allowed only five hits and zero runs. Polvani’s powerful performances have been key for the Bulldogs this season, even though yesterday’s game was only the 16th of his college career.
“He kept us off balance,” Harvard sophomore Jeff Reynolds said “We just didn’t adjust as a team.”
That said, the Crimson had effective pitching of its own from yesterday’s starter, freshman Joey Novak.
“We were really happy with the way Novak pitched today,” Walsh said. “He was throwing the ball well, with good velocity, and he’s giving me thoughts about that fourth spot we have open on the weekends.”
The game was Novak’s first start for Harvard, and brings his record to 1-2 on the season.
While the Crimson’s pitchers held their own on the mound, two costly throwing mistakes helped Bryant build up its lead in later innings on the way to the win.
The defensive control of play started early in the game, with Novak striking out the Bulldog’s first hitter swinging and both teams allowing their opponents only one hit through the end of the second inning.
In the third frame, Bryant looked like it was about to take the lead after its runner advanced to third base off a Harvard error with two-outs in the inning, but the next batter grounded out to Novak, leaving the runner stranded.
The Crimson also presented its first threat of the game when three hitters got on base in the bottom of the third.
But the Bulldogs’ defense pulled through, leaving Harvard junior Sam Franklin and sophomore Brent Suter on base.
An RBI double by junior Zakary Cianciolo put Bryant ahead in the top of the fourth, and a two-out homer by freshman Kevin Brown gave the Bulldogs a 2-0 lead by the end of the next inning.
But the lead could have been bigger, were it not for Suter running down a fly ball at the right-field fence in the top of the fifth, making it his second huge defensive play of the night.
“Suter’s such a great athlete,” Reynolds said. “And he really showed it there.”
But in the sixth inning, Bryant pulled even further ahead when senior Nick Campbell advanced to third on a wild pitch and then scored an unearned run off a throwing error by Novak.
While Polvani’s pitching kept the Crimson’s bats quiet, the Bulldogs steadily built their lead and made it 4-0 by the eighth inning, thanks to another Harvard throwing error, this time by junior reliever Zach Hofeld.
“Two big plays today were where our pitchers overthrew the bases, and [Bryant] wrapped up two runs,” Walsh said. “In a game like that today, you go into the late innings trailing four to nothing, versus two to nothing, and it makes you play a little differently.”
In the bottom of the eighth, it looked as if the Crimson offense might finally get on the board when junior Sean O’Hara hit a hard line drive up the center with two outs and two men on base.
But the Bulldogs’ centerfielder made a sliding catch just behind second base to get the inning’s final out.
In the ninth, both teams failed to get even a hit, and the game ended in a 5-0 victory for Bryant.
Despite the loss, Waslh was optimistic about his team’s play against the Bulldogs.
“We had some good defense and some good pitching today,” Walsh said. “But [Bryant’s] pitcher had some great stuff going on up there on the mound, and in the end, they’re just a good ball club.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From its opening sweep of its home tournament to its recent defeat of nationally-ranked CSU East Bay, the Harvard women’s water polo team (11-9) has stepped up its game all season long. The sophomore-infused lineup has proven itself against squads from across the country, but there’s one opponent they’ve been waiting for all season: the one that keeps getting away.
For the Crimson’s seniors, Brown (18-10) has remained elusive for the first three years in uniform. Tonight’s 8 p.m. home game against the Bears is the first of what will likely be the last three or four chances for the seniors to beat Brown for the first time in their collegiate careers. Co-captains Kelly Peeler and Kristina Bergquist, and classmate Roxanne Pinto are now 0-10 against the Bears.
Last year was particularly heartbreaking, as Harvard suffered three one-goal losses at the hands of Brown, the last of which was an overtime defeat in the Northern Division Championships.
“It’s a longstanding and hotly-contested bitter rivalry,” Crimson coach Erik Farrar said. “We’re definitely looking to stick it to them. It should be a fun game.”
This just might be the year for the Harvard seniors to finally knock off their bitter rival.
Though Brown comes into the matchup ranked 20th in the country, the task of taking down a ranked opponent might seem less daunting than usual, since the Crimson has already beaten one—then-No. 19 CSU East Bay­—two weeks ago. Meanwhile, the Bears have lost all three of their games against nationally-ranked opponents. While the loss to No.1 Southern California was perhaps not surprising, Brown’s loss against No. 18 UC Davis suggests that Harvard can be competitive with its rival.
“Brown’s one of our biggest games,” junior Shami Entenman said. “It will be a very evenly matched water polo game.”
In the midst of its successful season, the Crimson has garnered numerous individual recognition. Sophomore Devan Kennifer has twice been named the Northern Division Player of the Week, classmate Laurel McCarthy has earned Defensive Player of the Week nods, and freshman Elise Molner was named Northern Division Rookie of the Week.
During the team’s trip to California last month, Kennifer logged three hat tricks and posted 11 goals in six games. But the reigning Northern Division Rookie of the Year, who also recorded seven steals during that stretch, has hardly been Harvard’s only offensive weapon. In the team’s most recent game—a 10-8 loss to Marist—it was freshman Aisha Price who recorded the hat trick and sophomore Shannon Purcell who added two goals.
But Kennifer and the rest of the Crimson attack won’t have easy looks on net tonight as long as Bears senior Stephanie Laing stays between the posts. Laing earned her fifth Defensive Player of the Week nod yesterday. Earlier this season, the goaltender was named Northern Division Player of the Week for three straight weeks and became only the second player in league history to do so.
“I think she’s a really good goalie,” Entenman said. “We’ve been practicing a lot and hopefully [she] won’t get in our way.”
Laing’s presence in goal could spell trouble for a Harvard team that is 1-7 when it fails to score in double digits. Making matters even more daunting, the Crimson will face the reigning Northern Division Co-players of the Week in senior attackers Lauren Presant and Sarah Glick. The two combined for 29 goals and 22 assists in seven games, and Presant was one of 40 players to be invited to the Speedo Top 40, a round robin tournament and national team tryout this past October.
“Both teams know each other very well,” Farrar said. “There will be very few surprises.”
Both teams’ goal scorers and goaltenders usually gain the most attention of opposing teams. But according to Farrar, the matchup at center will be another focal point. Freshman Elise Molner will look to make a splash in her first conference game ever, as she will face Brown junior Joanna Wohlmuth.
“There are some strong centers [on both sides],” Farrar said. “Both are capable of ejections and strong kick outs.”
With the arrival of Molner and the continued emergence of strong sophomores such as Kennifer and McCarthy, Harvard has a chance to challenge the Bears’ recent dominance. The young lineup has been making waves all season, but a win against Brown would show that the squad can truly compete with quality teams in its division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard softball team took a break from conference play yesterday, it certainly didn’t lose any momentum.
The Crimson (11-15, 3-1 Ivy) traveled to Worcester, Mass. for a doubleheader with in-state rival Holy Cross (6-18, 2-2 Patriot) and swept the Crusaders, 9-6 and 6-3, at Freshman Field.
Junior Ellen Macadam led the offense with a 5-for-7, 4-RBI performance, while sophomores Rachel Brown and Julia Moore took the wins on the mound.
“I thought we came out hard,” sophomore Whitney Shaw said. “We scored a lot of runs, we had a lot of hits. Our offense is kind of getting into a groove now, which was great, and it was backed up by solid pitching.”
HARVARD 6, HOLY CROSS 3
The Crimson plated a pair of runs in the first inning and never looked back, cruising to a 6-3 win in yesterday’s nightcap.
Macadam led the game off with a single to left field and promptly stole second.
The junior then scored the game’s first run on co-captain Melissa Schellberg’s RBI single to right.
“[Ellen had] been struggling a little bit before today, and she came out with fire in her eyes,” co-captain Margaux Black said. “She came out ready to smash the ball, and that’s exactly what she did.”
Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, then came around to score on a passed ball to give Harvard the early 2-0 lead.
Holy Cross got one back in the bottom of the inning on a Keeley Seniuk RBI double, but the Crimson rebounded in the top of the second.
Again, Macadam proved to be the catalyst for the Harvard offense, plating senior Jennifer Francis with a sacrifice fly. Junior Emily Henderson came around to score on the same play thanks to an error by Crusader pitcher Katie Alexander.
Moore sparkled for the next four innings, allowing just one hit and one walk after the first.
“Julia Moore had an awesome game,” Black said. “She pitched lights out—she was fantastic. She really shut them down.”
Francis led off the sixth with a homer to right, and Macadam came around to score later that inning. After the junior doubled to center field, senior Stephanie Krysiak brought her home with an infield single, pushing the advantage to 6-1.
Holy Cross tightened the score in the bottom of the inning, when Erin Fleming and Sam Fregenti hit a home run apiece off sophomore Mari Zumbro, who was making her first pitching appearance of the year.
But 6-3 was as close as the Crusaders would get, as Black pitched a scoreless seventh to earn the save.
HARVARD 9, HOLY CROSS 6
The Crimson showed no signs of travel fatigue in the first game of the doubleheader, opening up a 6-0 lead in the first four innings.
With Krysiak aboard with one out in the first, the Harvard bats went to work, as Macadam launched one of her three doubles of the game to plate Krysiak.
Macadam scored one batter later on Shaw’s RBI single, and the sophomore came around herself on a Francis fielder’s choice.
“It really just starts the game off right if you score runs in the first inning,” Black said. “It shuts the other team down, and if you can keep scoring…and keep putting the pressure on, then the other team will just fall.”
Krysiak made it a 4-0 game in the top of the second, doubling home freshman Kassy Shiotani, who reached base on a leadoff single.
The Crimson tacked on another pair in the top of the fourth, with freshman Mariel Sena striking first. Sena singled to lead off the inning and then crossed the plate on a Holy Cross error.
Krysiak, who reached base on that error, was then brought around by another Macadam RBI double.
Though Brown had a gem going through the fourth—allowing no baserunners while striking out six-straight batters—she faltered in the fifth.
The Crusaders crossed the plate six times in the inning, with the biggest blow a grand slam from Courtney Nealon.
All of a sudden, the 6-0 lead had evaporated, and Harvard was looking at a tie game.
“I thought we [handled] it very well,” Shaw said. “We just didn’t put much pressure on ourselves, and just let our offense do what it was doing before.”
Once again, it was Macadam who put her team on her back, plating Shiotani with yet another RBI double before coming around on Shaw’s double to left.
Sophomore Jane Alexander added an insurance run in the seventh, singling through the left side to open the inning and then scoring on a sacrifice, a walk, and a passed ball.
Brown settled down to close out her seventh win of the season.

If you’re still suffering from hot-breakfast withdrawal, head over to Subway, which started serving breakfast this past Monday.
Sanjay Kansagra, the owner of the Subway franchise in The Garage, said that some customers—“mostly working people nearby”—have come in to try the breakfast option, but that most of Subway’s customers do not know about it yet.
The nationwide advertising campaign is just beginning, Kansagra said.
The addition of breakfast to Subway’s menu did not require Kansagra to purchase any new equipment for his franchise, he said. One employee’s hours had to be extended so that Subway could begin serving at 7 a.m. Previously, one employee was on the premise to bake bread, but the restaurant was not open for business that early.
Though Subway will have tough competition from Dunkin Donuts and other fast breakfast places in the area, Kansagra said he is “always hopeful” that it will do well.
“I love it,” Kansagra said of the new meal option. He recommends “The Western Egg Sandwich."

For anyone who's ever had to resort to an original concoction because the Harvard University Dining Service offerings were too banal, the Cabot Food Literacy Project may have come up with some creative guidance.
Student cooks and FLP reps in Cabot House have churned out their first-ever Cabot Dining Hall Cookbook chock-full of recipes that can be made with ingredients regularly found in the dining hall.
Armed with such measuring tools as the HUDS teaspoon and the HUDS paper cup, with this recipe book, you too can recreate former award-winning Harvard Top Chef dishes and tasty alternatives with ordinary dining hall ingredients.
But just how tasty are these simplistic formulas to savor? We decided to give one of the recipes a try.
"Baked Apple"
Ingredients: apple, cinnamon/brown sugar, granola
Directions: 1) Slice apple thinly. 2) Microwave 1-2 minutes until soft. 3) Add cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, and granola—drizzle with honey/maple syrup.
At first, using the table knife to slice the red delicious apple thinly was a task that sounded easy. But the knife wasn't sharp enough to make clean slices, so we ended up with slices that had fuzzy edges.
We left the skin on and microwaved the apple in a yogurt dish on high (power 10) for two minutes. The result was a blemished apple. The dish was very hot.
We mixed the apples with the ingredients into a cereal bowl (so that we could hold it). After much churning, it actually tasted pretty good at the end. Probably a bit too sweet for some tastes (maybe a little less brown sugar?), but a delicious treat nonetheless.
There are many other recipes to try. So find one in a local Cabot dining hall today!

CORRECTION: April 7, 2010
An earlier verison of the April 7 post "A 'Cook' Book by Cabot" incorrectly stated that the Cabot House cooking competition was titled "Cabot Iron Chef." In fact, it was called "Harvard Top Chef.
