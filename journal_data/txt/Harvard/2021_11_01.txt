After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Life, lately, has seemed like it’s full of goodbyes. Whether it be to friends, partners, or phases of life, no amount of scratching and clawing at the way things used to be is actually keeping them that way.
Maybe you’ve been haunted, too, by the ghosts of your past — unable to detach yourself from the moments you shared with a person or in a place you wish you could return to. After many failed attempts to hold on to the relationships I’ve had with people, places, and things once the connection had begun to fade naturally, I’m beginning to reframe what it has to mean to say goodbye in the first place.
I’ve come to see that everything in life comes and goes in phases. There’s a natural ebb and flow to life; it’s a dance we’re, unfortunately, not leading. In this dance, relationships and experiences come and go with the rhythm of life. With the coming is the going, you cannot have the full experience of one without the other.
As wonderful as it is when newness dances into your life, perhaps it can be as wonderful when it dances out again. Change being unavoidable, is it possible to welcome it? When we embrace the idea that all things end, we can be more intentional about enjoying them while they last. However, when we try to assume control of the goings-on of the universe and seek to force situations to last past their natural ending, we turn a beautiful experience into a painful, ugly shadow of itself and taint all of the things that made it worth wanting to hold on to in the first place. The beautiful dance turns into choppy, awkward movements — the rhythm of life thrown off course when we try to impose our will.
At the foundation of this idea is a sense of wonder and gratitude we can cultivate towards the chaotic universe for ever having led us to cross paths with a specific person or location in the first place. Life is infinite in its randomness and to connect with a specific person is rare beyond a scale we could ever understand. Applied to our current friendships and relationships, this gives them a heightened meaning and incredulous worth.
Two paths equal in their chaos managed to cross. What will you do with those moments to give them the magnitude they deserve? And when the universe unravels further, can you let go once again? To understand yourself as a small part of a greater whole is to let go more easily but also to connect with deeper meaning knowing how special and unlikely each interaction is.
To meditate on the vastness of the universe, it’s amazing to think that amongst all of the places life could take us, we somehow ended up exactly where we are. On a large scale, we could've been born into a different time or in a completely different part of the world. On a smaller scale, we could’ve attended different high schools or chosen different hobbies. Smaller still, the randomness of the everyday human experience seems to shake us up from hour to hour, detouring us, for example, from one coffee shop to another because the first was unexpectedly closed.
On large scales and small, each moment was brought into being as the result of an incomprehensibly long series of events and occurrences that led up to us being in the exact places we are now. Basking in the glory of this omnipotent chain of events, we can see in a new light how astonishing it is to ever have crossed paths with another person on an equally complex journey in the first place.
Of all the places we could’ve been and all the times we could’ve been there, we both find ourselves in the here and now and that sets the foundation for appreciating each moment we share with another, because inherent to this belief is the understanding that two such paths will separate again.
In such a moment, it is our duty (for both ourselves and the other) to let go and embrace the bittersweetness of departure knowing that the idea of “gone” is a false notion — a product of linear thinking. Just like if I were to remind you of the emotional relief that accompanies a mother’s hug and the way that such a feeling stays with you, so can all the other experiences of life. They live on in the way they impact you and affect your perception of the world: Certain friendships, relationships, and phases shape the lens through which you see the world, and in that way, such experiences occur infinitely through the course of your life.
Moments in life do not come and then taunt you from the past; they come, ingrain themselves in your being, and integrate into your essence. From that time on, you carry them with you as you continue on. In this way, there doesn’t need to be departures as we currently know them and it makes me think that a life full of goodbyes might be a life well-lived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newspapers usually report on the news, yet the Wall Street Journal’s opinion section recently made some of their own. The newspaper decided to publish a letter ridden with falsehoods authored by former President Donald Trump that promoted the conspiratorial claim that the 2020 presidential election was “rigged.” Broad, rightful backlash swiftly followed.
We find it baffling that the Wall Street Journal published the presidential collection of patently false bullet points. The letter, a response to a WSJ editorial on Pennsylvania’s handling of mail-in ballots, didn’t live up to any reasonable expectation of accuracy or truthfulness, let alone to the rigorous standards we’d expect from one of the most prominent opinion pages in the nation. The former president repeated poorly sourced, disproven claims, including the fiction that 25,000 sinister nursing home ballots helped sway the result.
Trump did so with a microphone courtesy of the very journalistic institution that, in its defense of publishing the letter,  acknowledges most of his claims to be “false” and perhaps even “bananas.”
This letter should not have been published, but the principle behind why is important to understanding opinion journalism: There exists an important difference between a contested opinion and a provable falsehood. Opinion sections are specifically for the former, not the latter.
It is always in the interest of the pursuit of truth and journalistic integrity for newspapers to ensure that the opinions they publish stem from facts. Journalistic institutions cannot be in the business of publishing known falsehoods. Trump’s letter with its presentation of falsehoods as fact constitutes an open assault on the truth-seeking ideals journalism ought to embody.
The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Board, responding to criticism, released a statement arguing that readers must be trusted to “make up their own minds”' regarding the claims in Trump’s letter. But there is no making up one’s mind about Trump’s demonstrably false claims. Readers do not fact-check the articles they consume, nor should a newspaper expect them to do so; readers trust us journalists to do that for them. As we have opined in the past, running a false statement and then a true statement does not constitute a net neutral.
That’s not to say Trump’s false claims should never be heard. Newspapers provide a time and place for this coverage, where readers can engage with important events and the actions of prominent figures in an unbiased manner and “make up their own minds”: the news section. The Wall Street Journal’s news team has already done extensive research and reporting on the former president’s claims, often proving them false. If the paper truly wanted to hold Trump accountable for his claims, as its editorial board suggests, they have ample inches to do so through other means.
Publishing them as a standalone piece in the opinion section, uncontested and under the legitimizing WSJ logo, is deeply reckless and dangerous. It encouraged readers to consider the falsehoods on equal grounds with the other fact-checked pieces of the opinion section: High fact-checking standards cannot differ between letters to the editor and op-eds or editorials.
The Wall Street Journal damages not just its own reputation, but that of journalism as a whole by knowingly, farcically legitimizing false claims. The newspapers are vital to a healthy democracy and with this power comes the social responsibility to publish truth.
As an editorial board ourselves, we strive for these ideals and seek to learn from others’ failure to uphold them. We aim, albeit imperfectly, to always prioritize and affirm truth, to opine only on events we have researched and understood in-depth, and to rigorously fact-check every piece we publish. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board should hold themselves to the same standard.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sequels are often worse than originals. I wish this one did not bear writing.
Last February, I condemned the deferral of General Education 1076: Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education, Harvard’s seminal K-12 education course. Now, I write to protest the abrupt, furtive cancellation of the Harvard Teacher Fellows. Harvard has now dismantled its two primary pathways into teaching. In doing so, the College inflames a longstanding rash of hypocritical negligence towards education.
When I eagerly joined HTF in November 2020, I never suspected that I would be among its final members. I now know I skated across an ice bridge that melted right after I crossed. As of this coming year, HTF has been “subsumed” by the Teaching and Teacher Leadership Program.
Two key failures, of communication and ownership, have tarnished this redesign. Most vitally, the application for the TTL residency track is due today, Nov. 1! And prospective Harvard applicants have not been given a fair chance to learn about and apply to this program.
In autumns past, you couldn’t set foot in an education-related space at Harvard without hearing about HTF. But it being subsumed into TTL has been kept ominously quiet. There was a single TTL info session earlier this month, nothing on the HTF website until two weeks ago, and seemingly no emails sent to get anyone interested in TTL — not even to the Education Secondary listserv. Even today, on its application due date, the TTL website still lacks any concrete details about the number of fellowships.
It should raise a red flag that a program soliciting applications advertised itself so poorly. If TTL is so promising, why not shout it from the rooftops? “HTF is being brilliantly reimagined, and anyone who was formerly interested should apply to TTL!” Instead, this thundering silence suggests a desire to go unnoticed — or contentment to allow fewer Harvard undergraduates to teach.
Even now, to my knowledge, no one has directly told current fellows of our program’s cancellation. TTL leadership ruptured a crucial chain of communication present in any program: Current fellows advise and recruit interested applicants. HTF’s current cohort is the best-positioned to inform the next class of undergraduates of TTL’s existence. We should have been among the first told. Instead, to friends who have asked, “Does Harvard have a teacher education program anymore?” I’ve had to say, “I don’t know.”
TTL’s communication has been not only sparse but entirely reactive. Until a concerned professor reached out on behalf of confused students two weeks ago, last year’s deadlines remained on the HTF website. It wasn’t until The Crimson wrote an article on TTL (after I reached out suggesting the coverage) that HGSE put out a self-praising press release on the program.
Now, at today’s deadline, any communication is too late. Our current HTF cohort has 33 members, with many more applications turned away. As of Oct. 27, only 40 people have started a TTL application.
These failures of communication also obscure programmatic drawbacks. TTL offers some advantages: namely, openness to non-Harvard students, and the flexibility to choose either a residency or internship track. But Harvard cannot tout these positive changes without acknowledging two major disadvantages.
Where HTF required two spring courses, providing six months of training before we entered classrooms in July, TTL fellows now have only a nebulous “spring core experience.” Without bearing academic credit, this will, at best, amount to a glorified book club — leaving teachers far less prepared.
And while HTF funded every student, TTL does not. Instead, “top candidates” will compete for limited fellowships. Harvard’s Graduate School of Education will accept more tuition-paying students and likely shell out fewer scholarships. This change need not be nefarious to be damaging. Gone is another central facet of HTF: the drive to make teaching viable for Harvard undergraduates of all financial backgrounds, some of whom might otherwise choose more lucrative fields. This will surely happen more now.
Especially frustrating is the fact that Harvard created, then undermined these programs. It’s not that Harvard didn’t offer a great K-12 education course or teacher education program. Gen Ed 1076 was among the most popular courses at Harvard; HTF built its size and capacity each year. But decision-makers either didn’t understand or value these programs, and so dismantled them. With Gen Ed 1076, Harvard missed a golden opportunity to adjust in response to over 1,000 alumni, students, and professors urging the course to be renewed. There might have been a similar outcry around HTF, were this situation not kept so clandestine.
I am sick of Harvard’s hypocrisy towards education. And I’m devastated that future undergraduates have lost the opportunity of HTF — and won’t even know what they’re missing. Harvard is relegating education to the storage closet and deluding itself if it thinks that students will still find their way there. Or, perhaps, the College doesn’t particularly care to have its alumni land in classrooms. Teachers don’t cut big checks.
Twice now, Harvard has quietly axed opportunities that encouraged its undergraduates to teach. The least we can do is make things less quiet. Do administrators understand the cumulative gravity of these choices? Do they care? Do you?
I have every hope that TTL can be a new and improved HTF. But Harvard must: first, extend the deadline; second, clarify the number of spots and fellowships offered; and third, acknowledge its missteps with an apology. If you agree, email TTL Faculty Co-Chairs Victor Pereira and Heather Hill to demand these three things — before today’s deadline.

Past asteroid collisions took place far more frequently than previously thought and influenced the timeline of Earth’s increase in atmospheric oxygen, according to a recent study by Harvard Earth and Planetary Sciences faculty.
The study, co-authored by Nadja Drabon, an assistant professor of EPS at Harvard, and Simone Marchi, a research scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, found that during the Archean eon — 2.5 billion to 4 billion years ago — asteroids over six miles wide struck the Earth roughly every 15 million years.
When such a large asteroid hits the Earth, it vaporizes part of the planetary crust, according to Drabon. These particles, called impact spherules, eventually fall back down on the Earth like rain. In ancient rocks, the impact spherules now appear as small spherical grains.
For this study, Drabon and Marchi examined rocks from South Africa for impact spherules. Based on the layers present in the rock, they determined that impacts took place roughly 10 times more often than predicted in previous models.
According to Drabon and Marchi, the prevalence of large asteroid strikes offers important clues as to the early Earth’s oxygen levels.
When asteroids hit, the particles it throws into the air react with oxygen, decreasing its concentration in the air.
“The impact rate was just so high that even if there would have been oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere, that would have been sucked out because of these meteorite impacts,” Drabon said.
However, starting 2.5 billion years ago, the large asteroid incidents tapered off. According to Drabon, the decreased frequency is because there were fewer large asteroids in the nearby solar system that could impact the Earth.
“As hundreds of millions and billions of years pass, that’s just going to be less material,” Drabon said.
Soon after the strikes stopped, Earth’s oxygen levels increased.
Drabon began researching this question in 2019, but the project was delayed by the impacts of the pandemic.
“Because we submitted the study during Covid, it just took a long time to get feedback from reviewers,” she said. “Just months and months and months of sitting and waiting.”
Now that the study is published, the researchers’ next steps involve understanding more about the impact of these collisions on areas other than atmospheric oxygen.
Since the collisions were so big, they potentially could have influenced the chemical composition of Earth’s crust and the evolution of Earth’s mantle, among other factors.
According to Drabon, the team’s discovery is salient for a more complete understanding of human life on Earth.
“We’re talking about rocks that are 3 billion years old, and these giant meteorite impacts, it’s kind of hard to imagine,” she said. “But once you think about how without the oxygen we couldn’t have evolved, I think that connects it a little bit more to us today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only a day before polls open in the Boston mayoral election, candidates Michelle Wu ’07 and Annissa Essaibi George are making their final appeals to voters, with a focus on getting out the youth vote.
Both candidates attended a student forum hosted by Boston University on Friday. On Wednesday, Wu hosted a press conference for Boston-area college students.
Wu and Essaibi George advanced from September’s preliminary election with 33.4 and 22.5 percent of the vote, respectively, and will go head-to-head in Tuesday’s general election.
Friday’s forum was divided into two town hall-style conversations with each candidate, moderated by BU students. An early topic for both candidates was Allston’s affordable housing crisis, spurred in part by the neighborhood’s large and growing student population.
Essaibi George, a BU alum, said the city must work “in partnership” with its large universities to combat rising costs of living, particularly by creating “more opportunities for on-campus housing.”
“When we think about housing, the impact that all of the college students — who are really a positive, a net add to our city — there is a very direct impact on the cost of living,” she said. “Across the city, we need to create more opportunities for housing affordability.”
Wu said the city must go further than building more units to alleviate the housing crisis.
“Since the beginning of this race, I’ve been the only candidate in support of rent stabilization,” Wu said. “Not just boosting the supply of housing, but ensuring we are taking action for emergency relief to keep families in their homes right now.”
During Wednesday’s student press conference, Wu said she believes “community-based conversations” are key to addressing the affordability crisis. She referenced Arnold Arboretum — a botanical garden which is owned by the City of Boston but managed by Harvard — as an example of what can be accomplished as a result of Boston and Harvard’s “long-term relationship.”
“Now is another generational opportunity for our institutions to ensure that we are putting people first and creating the future that Boston and the greater Boston area deserves,” Wu said. “We have to have a collaborative partnership when it comes to redevelopment and planning.”
Wu said collaboration between the University and the city is essential to the Allston interchange project, which Harvard is partially funding, as well as climate resiliency projects in the area such as those stemming from Wu’s signature “Boston Green New Deal.”
Both candidates concluded their remarks Friday by emphasizing the influence young voters have in Boston’s electoral process.
Essaibi George asked how she could better understand the issues affecting young Boston residents.
“Your voices, your experiences are really important around the academics, around the housing, around the nightlife, around what we’re creating for cultural opportunities around our city,” she said.
Wu referenced the “amazing” and “electric” victories by U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael S. Rollins, crediting high youth turnout with the results.
“You are the powerhouse when it comes to really making a difference in these races,” Wu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents, siblings, and relatives of the Class of 2025 had to dodge strikers and escape storms this weekend as they visited Harvard for First-Year Family Weekend.
Families began trickling into Harvard Yard on Thursday for the start of four days of programming. Wearing red badges emblazoned with “Harvard College Family,” parents explored campus, visited libraries, and attended classes such as Economics 10a: "Principles of Economics" and Computer Science 50: "Introduction to Computer Science."
The flagship event on Friday featured speeches from University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who spoke to a packed Sanders Theatre about the transition to college.
Moments after Bacow started his speech, he was interrupted by protesters supporting the third day of a strike by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers. Over 40 students and their supporters acquired red badges and snuck into the theater to stage the demonstration.
After the protest ended, Bacow continued his speech in which he expressed gratitude to parents for choosing Harvard as the next step in their children’s education.
“Thank you again for entrusting these remarkable young people to us,” he said. “It is a real privilege to be with them, to work with them, to teach them, but to also learn from them.”
Khurana spoke about how students will grow throughout their time at the College and the lessons they will learn.
“We want our students to understand that our society is not a machine that runs on its own; rather, it depends on good people who are willing to help recreate it,” he said.
Some parents decided to protest outside Memorial Hall rather than attend the speeches by Bacow and Khurana in support of the strike.
Carey Kasapidis — a parent visiting from Duluth, Minn. — said she skipped the event in solidarity with the strikers.
“We were outside with the crowd,” she said. “We never went in. We didn’t cross the line.”
Freshmen and their families also attended Fall Fest on Saturday, where they braved the pouring rain to tailgate ahead of the football game between the Harvard Crimson and the Dartmouth Big Green.
Despite heavy showers and a 20-17 loss for Harvard, parents said they enjoyed the football game.
“The weather is unfortunate, but it’s still fun to be here and experience it,” said freshman parent Carl Francioli.
Scott Riddle — a parent from Texas — also said he was having a good time at the game, though he was unimpressed with the level of football being played.
“I'm sitting here thinking about how many high school teams back in Texas would beat up either of these teams,” Riddle said.
Dean Graham, who was visiting from Chevy Chase, Md., described the weekend as “wonderful” and said the highlight was spending time with his son and learning about college life.
“Harvard does a really nice job for the parents to try to get a sense of what your kid’s life is like as a student,” he said.
Maria Cheriyan ’25 said it was difficult to find time for class work in between family obligations.
“It’s been a bit difficult balancing school and upcoming midterms with seeing my family, but it’s a necessary sacrifice,” Cheriyan said. “They also sacrificed a lot for me to be able to get to Harvard, so I’m glad that they can have this experience too.”
Other students encountered different struggles with welcoming their parents to campus and inside their dorm rooms.
Simon Sun ’25 said he put a lot of effort into preparing his space for the arrival of his parents.
“I cleaned my room for them, but they were not very impressed by it,” he said. “So that was sort of unfortunate.”

Harvard will not make Covid-19 booster shots mandatory anytime soon, University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen said in a Thursday interview.
Though Nguyen said HUHS does not have “any intention right now of making booster shots mandatory,” he encouraged individuals to monitor their booster shot eligibility and consider getting one if eligible.
“It’s not something that you have to rush out to get right now. And anyone who really is eager to do it soon can do it at a commercial pharmacy free of charge, so that is an option as well if you don’t want to wait to get a booster through HUHS,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen also explained that anyone 18 years and older who had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their first dose is now eligible to receive a booster shot. He recommended Pfizer or Moderna shot for their second dose due to a greater immune response from mRNA vaccines.
For individuals who received Pfizer or Moderna for their first round of vaccine doses, the CDC does not recommend any particular brand for the booster shot.
While HUHS plans to offer booster shots in the future, Nguyen said it is still focused on providing primary Covid-19 doses as well as flu shots, which Harvard students are required to receive by Dec. 1 to avoid a registration hold being placed on their account.
Nguyen encouraged students to get their flu shot and report it on the patient portal a few weeks before the deadline to avoid any processing delays.
“Especially if you get your flu shot outside of HUHS, it does take time to process the paperwork,” Nguyen said. “If we get thousands of papers submitted all at once at the last minute, they are not going to get processed the minute they arrive.”
Nguyen said he was unsure when Harvard would lift its indoor mask mandate.
“I can’t predict a specific timeline, but we can’t have a mask mandate forever. That’s just not realistic,” Nguyen said. “But we have to really make our decisions based on what’s happening around us and so for the time being, we don’t have a good reason to lift all of our mask requirements.”
As of Oct. 8, Harvard’s vaccination rate stands at 96 percent for students and 97 percent for employees.
Nguyen said the small percentage of unvaccinated affiliates consists largely of students who are enrolled but are not on campus, along with students trying to secure a vaccination after coming from locations where the vaccine was not readily accessible.
“We have continued to vaccinate people from our communities every week, in fact, throughout the term,” Nguyen said. “Even up until this month, we’ve been vaccinating people, and we continue to vaccinate more. And I anticipate that numbers will continue to edge up a little bit as we go on.”

The Harvard-Allston Task Force filed a 25-page comment letter with the Boston Planning Development Agency last week raising concerns over the University’s development of its Enterprise Research Campus project in Allston.
In the letter, dated Oct. 25, the task force — an advisory group for the BPDA focused on Harvard's development in Allston — wrote that it was unsatisfied with Harvard and developer Tishman Speyer’s engagement with Allston residents, affordable housing plan, and public transportation proposal.
Eleven of the 15 members of the task force penned the letter in response to a Draft Project Impact Report filed July 28 by Tishman Speyer, the firm the University tapped to develop the ERC — a development located on Harvard property next to the new Science and Engineering Complex that will seek to promote academic research and invigorate the neighborhood.
In its DPIR filing, Tishman Speyer upped the proportion of units the development will devote to affordable housing and detailed its diversity and sustainability goals.
The task force wrote last week that Tishman Speyer’s report was insufficient in scope, given that it only concerned “Phase A” of the ERC — an area the task force noted only represents 20 percent of the project’s total acreage.
The letter also identified resident outreach as a primary concern, alleging that the developer and Harvard “are not always listening” to the needs of “vulnerable populations.”
Signatories reiterated the task force’s request that Harvard and Tishman Speyer recruit an “independent facilitator” to conduct a comprehensive neighborhood “needs assessment.”
Calling high housing costs an “all-hands-on-deck crisis,” the letter also asked developers and Harvard to “play a prominent role” in improving local affordability.
Signatories wrote that they support dedicating 33 percent of the ERC’s units to Boston’s inclusionary development program — an increase from the 17 percent developers pledged would be in “Phase A.”
The signatories also want the residents living in the affordable units to have an average income of 60 percent or less than the area median income.
The letter also called on Harvard to dedicate additional landholdings to affordable and homeownership units.
“While we appreciate the offer of the Harvard property on Seattle Street for the construction of affordable housing, we would like to see a more comprehensive assessment of Harvard’s properties and possibilities for affordable housing partnerships, rather than offering up one parcel at a time with no larger vision,” signatories added.
Signatories also seek more information about how the developer will respond to recent increases in local transit ridership and traffic.
Without “clear commitments,” the letter added, it “is difficult to support Phase A of this project, and impossible to support further development of the ERC.”
Task force member and president of the Allston Civic Association Anthony P. “Tony” D’Isidoro said in an interview he is “proud” of his fellow signatories and called on Harvard to respond.
“We stand ready to, at some point, if it happens, be there in support of this endeavor,” he said. “But we can get there fairly quick, if we just get the dialogue going at a much higher level and they take some of our requests serious.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that Harvard thanks the task force for its input.
“Harvard appreciates the thorough work by the Harvard Allston Task Force in creating such a detailed evaluation of Tishman Speyer’s DPIR,” she wrote. “We look forward to reviewing the feedback provided, and to our continued collaboration with the Task Force.”

Administrators at the Dean of Students Office discussed the upcoming Harvard-Yale game, their review of the blocking process, and the House grille reopening strategy in a Friday interview with The Crimson.
Assistant Dean of Student Engagement Kate Colleran said the DSO and the College Events Board are planning a spate of in-person activities leading up to the Harvard-Yale game, which will be hosted in New Haven this year.
Though Yale will not be hosting Harvard students this year due to Covid-19 concerns, Colleran said she believes the in-person programming will get “students all revved up” for The Game.
“We do have a Harvard-Yale roast that we’ll still have, so that’s like a fun comedy night,” Colleran said. “There’s a faculty member who does a talk about the history of The Game, but from a comedic point of view.”
Colleran added that the schools usually hold a competition rooted in a meaningful societal contribution, such as the blood drive that occured at the last Harvard-Yale game.
The DSO also spoke about its ongoing review of the blocking process — the process by which freshmen choose the classmates with whom they want to live in an upperclassman house — that is being conducted in tandem with Graduate School of Education professor Richard J. Light and his research team.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said the idea for the review came from an Undergraduate Council survey in which undergraduates indicated the blocking process was one of many stressors for College students.
“Blocking seemed to come up multiple times, and so we decided that we would take an evidence-based approach to looking into it and investigating and seeing what the problem is and what possible action items or solutions could be,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair said that the group’s focus would be centered on the issues that students commonly encounter before and during the blocking period, which takes place in early March.
“Part of this group is going to diagnose what that problem [with the blocking process] is,” O’Dair said. “Just even discussing the blocking process in September creates stress for students, thinking that they have to have a certain number of group of friends with whom they will be living next year, and that seems awfully soon.”
The group conducting the review is planning to collect data on students’ thoughts on blocking, Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 added.
“I believe they’re also working on some surveys, I anticipate that there will be some outreach to students who are interested in sharing their experience,” Brandt said.
The group will also be utilizing tools other than student outreach to assess blocking, including “benchmarking” processes comparable to blocking at other institutions, O’Dair said.
The interview concluded with administrators providing an update on the reopening of House grilles.
“I know that the House grilles and the student managers of the House grilles have been working hard with environmental health and safety and our partners in HUDS. There are a lot of moving pieces to open up the House grilles,” Brandt said. “They are working their way through that list.
“We really want to make sure that they’re well trained, that they have the resources that they need, and that they can open the spaces in the way that feels best suited for their communities,” Brandt added.
When asked about the timeline for grille reopenings in a September interview, the DSO administrators declined to provide a tentative date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undeterred by the rainy weather, Harvard students donned their spookiest costumes and traversed campus this weekend to celebrate the first in-person Halloweekend for many since 2019.
Many House Committees organized events to celebrate the holiday, including Halloween-themed “Stein” cocktail hours — dubbed “FrankenSteins” — along with movie nights, cookie decorating events, and pumpkin carving sessions.
Caroline M. Kubacki ’22, a Currier HoCo co-chair, said she was excited to be planning “Heaven and Hell,” Currier’s annual Halloween party, which was held annually for more than 40 years before the pandemic.
“This is an event that historically is the freshman Halloween party. Everyone in the Quad usually comes and usually there’s a line all the way down to the [Student Organization Center at Hilles],” she said.
Kubacki said the pandemic posed challenges for planning larger celebrations. This year, Heaven and Hell was exclusive to Currier residents, and had a limit of 150 attendees.
But despite the logistical difficulties, Kubacki said the event was necessary to help preserve Currier House’s culture and traditions.
“Even with these restrictions, it’s necessary to have Heaven and Hell because the seniors are the only ones that know these House traditions,” Kubacki said.
Fariba Mahmud ’22, a co-chair of the Winthrop HoCo, said she has observed an overall rise in interest in House events over the past year.
“The dining hall was packed,” Mahmud said of Winthrop’s Harry Potter-themed community dinner on Thursday. “One of the House staff even said it was the fullest community dinner they’d seen.”
“I think that people do not want to take the time that we have on campus for granted,” she added.
On Friday, the Garment District, a thrift store in Cambridge, was filled with Harvard students scrambling for last-minute outfits.
Lauren Henderson, an employee at the Garment District, said in her experience, college students all celebrate Halloween a little differently.
“More projectile vomiting for the freshmen,” she said. “The seniors kinda chill out with the costumes; the freshmen go full out. They go out with a bang.”
Several student organizations hosted Halloween events throughout the weekend.
The Advocate and Fig. Magazine organized a haunted house on Saturday evening.
In one of the rooms, patrons were tasked with answering an SAT math question while in a room with a clown.
“The scariest part was probably the SAT question. We sat there doing math,” Nisha A. Seyed ’23 reported after leaving the haunted house.
Rory P. R. Plunket ’24 celebrated Halloween on Saturday night at a party in the basement of Tasty Burger hosted by Harvard’s rowing teams.
“I am from Zimbabwe, so we didn’t really do Halloween back there,” he said. “So this is my first proper Halloween.”
Plunket said he enjoyed his first Halloween experience.
“It has been amazing, all the costumes are great,” he said. “We haven’t had trick or treating or any of that, but that’s college.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union picketed freshman parents’ weekend events Thursday and Friday, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s welcoming address and lectures open to visiting parents, to maximize the effects of its three-day strike.
As parents checked in at the Smith Campus Center Thursday afternoon to receive schedules, maps, and badges, picketers marched through the building. On Friday, picketers passed out flyers in front of Sanders Theatre and the Science Center ahead of lectures open to parents. Strikers asked parents not to cross the picket line and that they email Harvard administrators in support of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
Arnold T. Stocker, a parent on his way to the Science Center Friday morning, said he found the picketing effective.
“I thought that whoever did the planning did an excellent job because they chose the family weekend to make a bigger impact on us, the parents coming in,” he said. “Now, we get an idea of how it affects our students, our kids.”
Anatoly “Toly” Rinberg, a HGSU-UAW organizer, said union members worked hard to engage parents throughout the strike.
“We’re training [picketers] to be very positive and really engage in conversation, so not just hand a flyer but really try to connect with the individuals they’re talking to,” Rinberg said. “In some cases, parents will take a flyer and nod and keep going, but I’ve actually had a number of pretty involved conversations.”
The grad student union is striking to demand better wages and benefits, third-party arbitration and coverage of legal expenses in cases of discrimination and harrassment, and agency shop.
Rinberg added he thinks the union’s demands — specifically its push for new procedures to handle complaints of discrimination and harassment as well as its ask for higher wages given the University’s endowment returns — “really resonate” with parents.
“One of the big things we’re asking, of course, is not to cross the picket line,” HGSU-UAW member Steven A. Rizzo said from the picket line in front of the Science Center Friday. “The other thing we’re asking is for parents to contact Larry Bacow and Alan Garber, the president and provost, to let them know that the educators who teach their children are in need of a contract and better working and living conditions.”
Abbie P. LeBlanc, an HGSU-UAW member who was handing out flyers in front of the Science Center Friday, said parents’ reactions were “variable.” Some, she said, turned away; others seemed more receptive.
“I think they seem persuaded or they’ve encountered a new idea and are processing that, and some people aren’t receptive,” LeBlanc said.
Hea Pushpraj ’25 and her mother Aparajita Pushpraj did not attend General Education 1174: “Life and Death in the Anthropocene” to stand with student workers.
Though Aparajita Pushpraj said she is “in complete support” of the grad student workers, she lamented not being able to see a Harvard class after traveling all this way.
“This is the opportunity for me to see how she’s taking class,” Aparajita Pushpraj said.
Hea Pushpraj said she is morally opposed to crossing the picket line but empathized with her mom.
“She traveled a long distance to get here, and so she wants to see everything that was a part of the events,” Hea Pushpraj said.
Parents Joshua W. Brown and Candy G. Brown ’92 said they were “conflicted” over the graduate student strike.
“I’d like to see them get a living wage and be treated well,” Joshua Brown said. “I hope it works out for them. But honestly, it’s not really my battle to fight. If I cross the picket line, it’s because I want to go see what my kid’s doing, not because I do or don’t care about their concerns.”
Before 3:30 p.m., picketers marched outside of Sanders Theatre as parents lined up to attend Bacow’s welcoming address.
Inside, undergraduates and HGSU-UAW members interrupted Bacow’s speech and proceeded out of the auditorium in protest, asking families to join them. Strikers then picketed around the Science Center Plaza tent, where a reception was taking place.
Before the picket line dispersed as the three-day strike ended, strikers told parents: “We’ll be back!”
But the Browns said their priority is their daughter and her education.
“I want my child to receive an education which I’m paying dearly for,” Joshua Brown said. “In the end, I’m not so concerned how it gets sorted out. I just want to sort it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rain came down early at Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, and with it, so did the offensive performances. As No. 21/RV Harvard (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) welcomed RV/RV Dartmouth (5-1, 2-1), the offenses got off to a slow start throughout the first quarter. In the early going, both teams remained mostly ground-bound, but when the rain stopped falling, the completed passes did. Both the Big Green and the Crimson orchestrated impressive touchdown drives and saw key contributions from many players in a game that came down to its final play. Ultimately, Dartmouth emerged with the 20-17 victory to improve to 6-1 and keep its Ivy League championship hopes alive. Meanwhile, Harvard fell to 5-2 and, after Princeton’s 34-16 victory over Cornell on Friday to stretch its record to 7-0, will need a lot of help to earn a share of the conference title.
The first fifteen minutes of the game saw neither team put points on the board as both offenses started out slowly. In the frame, both the Crimson and the Big Green relied primarily on their rushing games, which was the strength of both teams entering the game: each ranked in the top 30 in the Football Championship Series (FCS) in rushing yards per game. Harvard called eight run plays and four pass plays in the opening quarter, and Dartmouth complemented its four passes with 10 runs.
The Big Green made more of its runs than the Crimson did, racking up 35 yards in the first quarter. By contrast, Harvard turned its eight rushes into just four yards. Dartmouth quarterback Derek Kyler also made more of his passes in the early going than senior quarterback Jake Smith; each of the signal-callers completed three of their four passes, with Big Green receivers gaining 25 yards to the Crimson’s nine. Dartmouth also manufactured the only real scoring opportunity of the opening quarter, driving to Harvard’s 25-yard line behind a 22-yard run by running back Noah Roper. However, it was docked for a chop block penalty on 3rd and ten, setting the offense back 15 yards and pushing it out of field goal range.
It was the Crimson offense that struck first, on its second drive of the second quarter. Its opportunity was set up partially by junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes and sophomore cornerback Alex Washington, who combined for a strip sack on Kyler on third and two from the Harvard 43. Although the Big Green was able to jump on the ball and maintain possession, it lost eight yards on the play, which gave the Crimson some breathing room and denied Dartmouth punter Davis Golick the opportunity to pin Harvard inside its ten-yard line. Instead, junior wide receiver Kym Wimberly called for a fair catch at the 19.
Offensive coordinator Mickey Fein called for a pass on Harvard’s first play of the possession, notable because Dartmouth had been so effective against the run the entire game. Sophomore tight end Haven Montefalco’s 14-yard reception set the tone for the rest of the drive. After a few carries by junior running back Aaron Shampklin barely eked out the ten yards required to move the chains, the Crimson managed its biggest offensive play of the first half. Facing a third and eight near midfield, Smith took a shot down the right sideline. The play was covered well by Big Green cornerback Isaiah Johnson, but the football dropped perfectly in the hands of senior wide receiver Adam West. The 32-yard reception brought Harvard inside the red zone for the first time in the game.
The Crimson offense, which had produced a score on 22 of its previous 28 drives inside the opponent’s 20, converted to take an early lead. Harvard took advantage of a pass interference penalty committed by Dartmouth middle linebacker Jalen Mackie to earn a first down on the Big Green’s 11-yard line. On third down, Smith checked the ball down to Shampklin in the flat. The running back turned around and ran untouched into the end zone. Junior kicker Jonah Lipel converted the extra point to give the Crimson a 7-0 advantage.
Just like in the Oct. 23 loss to Princeton, Harvard conceded a tying score on the ensuing drive. Dartmouth head coach Buddy Teevens, a childhood friend of Murphy, alternated his quarterbacks, Kyler and wildcat option Nick Howard, and mixed in passes and runs. The first play of the drive was key for the Big Green: Kyler found wide receiver Painter Richards-Baker over the middle for a 23-yard completion. Shortly thereafter, Howard re-entered the game, completing a 15-yard pass to running back Zack Bair and reversing field before finding a slot up the right sideline for an 11-yard gain.
Ultimately, it was Kyler who landed the drive’s final blow. Facing second down from the five-yard line, he rolled out to his right, drawing Crimson defenders with him. Meanwhile, tight end Robbie Mangas slipped completely undetected into the left half of the end zone. Kyler turned and fired before Scott Larkee ‘99’s unit had a chance to adjust, and his 6’4” target hauled the ball in with no red jerseys in the vicinity. The fifth-year quarterback was in control all game, completing 20 of his 27 passes for 230 yards and the touchdown pass to Mangas. Dartmouth kicker Connor Davis nailed the game-tying extra point for his 58th straight conversion.
After Harvard went three-and-out on the next possession, the Big Green had the opportunity to run a two-minute drill and drive 44 yards in one minute, 49 seconds to take a lead. Although it fell short of the end zone, Kyler’s offense did manage to put points on the board. The Crimson defense was unable to stop Bair on 4th and 3 from the edge of field goal range at its 33-yard line, as the running back gained 15 yards to reward Teevens’ aggressive decision to keep his offense on the field against Harvard’s third-ranked fourth down defense. Shortly after, Davis knocked his 34-yard attempt straight through the uprights as the clock expired.
“I felt confident, but ultimately, I have full faith in [Teevens] again, and he ended up making the right call,” said Davis when asked about Teevens’ play call. “So that’s why we buy in here. I think there’s an incredible culture, like Nico was speaking to, and I think that’s what translates to a win on the field.”
For the second time in three weeks, Harvard’s special teams unit produced some fireworks on the opening kickoff of the third quarter. On Oct. 16 against Lafayette, the Crimson forced a fumble and recovered, leading to a field goal. This time, with Cameron Baller booting his kickoff amidst swirling wind, the football got held up and fell into the waiting arms of junior wide receiver Demarkes Stradford at the Harvard 14-yard line. The Crimson’s special teams unit, aided by junior linebacker Solomon Egbe’s block, opened up a massive hole up the middle and Stradford raced through and down the left sideline for an 89-yard score. The touchdown was Harvard’s first kick return for a touchdown since Oct. 14, 2017, when senior wide receiver Adam Scott returned a kickoff 90 yards to the end zone against Lafayette.
“I was cursing myself for not just squib kicking it,” Teevens said. “We thought we had a decent-legged guy. The ball just kind of wavered to the middle. They do a great job between them. Great return guys, and they just split it. And I don’t think he was touched, period.”
Suddenly, after facing a halftime deficit, the Crimson found itself playing from ahead. It was able to protect its lead on Dartmouth’s first possession of the half, which produced a 4th and 2 at Harvard’s 37-yard line. Faced with a similar situation to its last drive of the first half, with a fourth and short near the edge of field goal range, Teevens again decided to keep his offense on the field. This time, sophomore defensive lineman Nate Leskovec and senior linebacker Andrew Irwin stuffed Bair short of the line to gain.
However, the Crimson offense was unable to take advantage of the energy boost the stop brought and was forced to punt on each of its next three possessions. The Big Green defense was stout all game, limiting Harvard to just 223 total yards and 68 on the ground, well below its season averages. Shampklin, who entered the game as the Ivy League’s leading rusher, averaging 101.6 yards per game, produced just 76 yards on his 17 carries. On those three fruitless drives, the Crimson rushed for just three yards on three carries, forcing Smith to rely on his passing. After the game, Murphy praised Dartmouth’s coverage against the run.
“It’s been like that since [defensive coordinator] Don Dobes has been there. They’re going to stop the run first, just as we do at Harvard, and they’re always big, strong, and physical,” he said. “That’s what they do. They try to stop the run at almost all costs, although they’re able to do it unlike some teams in that they can play a relatively light box and get it done, because [of] the quality of their guys up front and their two inside linebackers.”
Kevin Daft’s offense eventually rewarded Dobes’ unit for its patience, as the Big Green found paydirt to reclaim the lead. Dartmouth marched down Soldiers Field with ruthless efficiency, traveling 80 yards in just seven plays and three minutes, 12 seconds. Kyler received the snap on each of the drive’s first six plays and looked mostly towards the edges of the field, completing passes to wide receiver Dale Chesson on the left sideline and wide receiver Jamal Cooney on the right. Chesson would go on to lead the team with 72 yards on five catches.
Before the seventh play of the possession, Howard checked back into the game. To that point in the game, he had completed only one of his three pass attempts, and the Crimson was watching out for a potential run play. However, Howard, who was all-conference first team as a high school quarterback in Green Bay, Wis., launched it downfield. Richards-Baker, who had run a deep post route from the right side, slid to haul in the pass and crossed the goal line in the process, giving the Big Green a 17-14 edge.
Faced with a deficit and a struggling run game, Smith decided to get aggressive, throwing deep on the first play of the ensuing possession. It proved to be a bad decision, for first-year tight end Tyler Neville was covered by two Dartmouth defenders, and safety Quinten Arello came down with the interception. It would also be Smith’s last play of the game; after giving the fifth-year senior the opportunity to start in the wake of sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean’s season-ending injury, Murphy turned to junior quarterback Luke Emge at the start of the fourth quarter. The coach said after the game that he would evaluate his signal-caller options before the game against Columbia on Nov. 6.
Emge made an immediate impact on the game, leading Harvard on a drive deep into Big Green territory on his first possession under center. All in all, he completed six of his eight passes for 73 yards, outperforming Smith, who was 11 for 21, gaining 82 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Shampklin provided the drive’s key play, taking a handoff down the left sideline for thirty yards, the Crimson’s longest rushing play of the game. However, after sophomore running back Aidan Borguet was stopped just short of the goal line, Dartmouth defensive back John Pupel made a huge tackle, wrapping Borguet up in the backfield on third and goal and limiting Harvard to a field goal attempt. Lipel pushed the 21-yarder wide right and the Big Green held on to its three-point edge.
“That was a big play. He called it, too, before he went out there,” explained Dartmouth safety Niko Mermigas, one of the team’s captains this season, when asked about Pupel’s tackle. “John usually predicts what he’s going to do pretty well, so he went and tracked it down. He’s a really good player. He gives really good effort, and he’s definitely somebody on the defense that cares the most.”
The Crimson earned another opportunity to tie the game after forcing the Big Green to punt. On the first play of the possession, Emge launched a deep ball that senior wide receiver B.J. Watson, who led the team with 52 yards receiving, dove to haul in. The 43-yard gain brought Harvard right back to the edge of the red zone, providing Lipel with an opportunity to redeem himself. After Shampklin went out of bounds just short of the line to gain on third down, he did just that, hammering his 31-yard attempt straight through the uprights and knotting the game at 17-17 with four minutes, 31 seconds to play in regulation.
Dartmouth stepped up to the line of scrimmage at its own 25-yard line, knowing that it needed to orchestrate a long drive to avoid overtime and travel back to Hanover, N.H. victorious. The Big Green looked to have made a big play on its third snap when Roper had an open field in front of him near midfield, but Kyler’s pass sailed just past his outstretched fingertips. The quarterback rebounded from the near miss by firing a strike to Mangas up the right hash marks that the tight end caught on a slide to advance the Dartmouth offense into Crimson territory.
Harvard then committed a critical penalty. Kyler’s completion to Chesson gained 15 yards to put the Big Green near the edge of field goal range at the Crimson 32-yard line. Then, the referee threw a flag away from the play, penalizing junior defensive lineman Anthony Nelson for putting his hand on a Dartmouth player’s facemask. The 15-yard penalty advanced the Big Green well into Davis’ range, and it slowed down its offense, inserting Howard and calling for three consecutive runs. Murphy did not call a timeout until after Leskovec combined with junior defensive lineman Chris Smith to stop Howard just short of a first down.
With 54 seconds left in the game, Davis trotted onto the field to attempt a 25-yard field goal. The snap was a little high, but Dartmouth’s holder brought the ball down before his kicker’s foot reached it. The kick looked to be veering wide, but it snuck just inside the right upright, giving the visitors a three-point edge and forcing Harvard to produce a game-tying field goal drive in just 49 seconds.
“I trusted these guys. I knew [Kyler] would get us down there, and I know I’ve mentioned in the past, I think I have the best snap-holder in the league,” Davis said. “So I had so much confidence in those guys. [I’ve] got the best group of guys on the sideline, getting me right. They have full faith in me, I have full faith in [Teevens], so when he called it, just go out there, try to treat it like any other. And thankfully, it went our way.”
The Crimson received the ball at its own 27-yard line after sophomore wide receiver Gavin Sharkey took the low kick 15 yards. On the drive’s first play, Dartmouth defensive lineman Shane Cokes committed a roughing the passer penalty, moving Harvard’s offense forward 15 yards. Emge then consistently targeted the right sideline, completing short passes to Neville, Shampklin, Neville again, then Wimberly to bring the offense to Dartmouth’s 37-yard line with eight seconds to play.
“I thought we executed fairly well,” Murphy said. “We made some plays and we gave ourselves a chance. And based on the time limitations and playing a prevent type of defense where you’re not going to get it over the top, I thought we did a very solid job executing, giving us a chance to get this thing into overtime.”
After Emge’s pass to Wimberly on third down sailed out of bounds, Lipel trotted out to attempt a 53-yard field goal into the wind. The kick left his foot from a similar spot to where, in 2019, Kyler had completed a 43-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to wide receiver Masaki Aerts to keep Dartmouth’s undefeated season alive in one of the Ivy League’s most dramatic endings ever. Instead of parallelling the 2019 game by instructing Emge to fire it towards the end zone, Murphy opted to trust his kicker. The 53-yarder would have marked the longest conversion of Lipel’s career.
“With a normal kicker, I would have absolutely chucked a Hail Mary,” Murphy said. “But with this kid … he hits it from 60 in practice, literally.”
While Lipel had the strength to reach the crossbar, he pulled the kick just a bit, and it fell a few feet left of the upright. As soon as it hit the ground, the well-traveled Dartmouth contingent erupted in celebration while Harvard fans sat silently. The 20-17 victory means that the Big Green’s matchup against Princeton on Nov. 5 in Hanover will be vital in determining an Ivy League champion. Meanwhile, the Crimson will need to regroup quickly and learn from its two consecutive single-possession losses.
“Right now, it’s not so much thinking about this last week in total, but just the fact that we went out there and dropped the ball today,” said senior linebacker Jordan Hill, who is serving as the 147th Captain of Harvard football this season. “Guys put in a lot of work, so for these to be the results is not anything that we seek to see, and it definitely is an opportunity for us to just look in the mirror and see what we need to do better to make sure that this doesn’t happen next time.”
Next week will be absolutely crucial if Murphy wants any chance of winning a tenth Ivy League championship this season. In order to secure a share of the conference championship, Harvard will need to win out and hope that Dartmouth loses one more time and the Tigers lose twice. Its path will not get any easier next week as it travels to New York City to face Columbia, who fell to 5-2 with a 37-30 loss to Yale on Saturday afternoon. If it loses to the Lions, its path to a title becomes virtually impossible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard snapped its two-game Ivy League scoreless streak in the seventh minute on Saturday afternoon en route to a comfortable 3-1 win over Dartmouth at Jordan Field that kept the Crimson (11-2-1, 4-2-0 Ivy League) in the hunt for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Standout midfielder Hannah Bebar played a part in all three Harvard goals, scoring twice and setting up the third goal beautifully to earn her league-high 10th assist in the Crimson’s final home game of the season and its second consecutive two-goal win over the Big Green (5-7-1, 1-5-0).
It might have been Harvard’s senior day, but it was the first-year Bebar who starred again. After she was held in check by Brown and Princeton in consecutive 1-0 defeats, Bebar found more time on the ball and freedom this time and made Dartmouth pay with the type of performance that makes it hard to believe that the Naperville, Ill., native is just a first-year.
“[Bebar] is such a talented player,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “She was able to demonstrate that today. As good as she is now, she can be even better, and I’m looking forward to seeing her grow up.”
The Crimson was clearly determined to make a statement against Dartmouth. Harvard did not take as many shots as it had the previous week against Princeton, but the shots it did manufacture were much higher-quality. The Crimson made it a priority to be more patient in possession, and it showed, particularly on Harvard’s final goal, which was arguably its best team goal of the season. The ball started at the back with junior center back Lara Schenk. 12 seconds, a few precise passes, and one well-placed Bebar finish later, it was in the back of the net, putting an exclamation mark on a good Crimson performance.
“We were patient in the build-up,” Hamblin said, “and then when we broke them we broke them with speed. And that for me was a great goal. I think that was exactly what we should try to do more of. I think we had taken some low percentage shots in the past, so for us to be able to focus on getting quality chances was huge.”
Junior midfielder Hollyn Torres scored the first goal, nutmegging the Big Green keeper from a tight angle for her first tally of the season. Torres, after not seeing the field in Harvard’s first six games, has played in every Ivy League game and started the last two after being a consistent contributor in her first-year season in 2019. The Crimson has a deeper team this time around, but injuries to key contributors have given her more of a chance to feature this year, and she capitalized on that chance on Saturday.
“It’s really great that a player like [Torres] who didn’t feature much early on in the season was able to come in last week against Princeton and play a solid 90 [minutes],” Hamblin said. “And then again today play a couple of different positions and be on the scoresheet. That just goes to show the type of character that she has and that we want and promote and celebrate.”
The Big Green got a late consolation goal after creating little for most of the game. Dartmouth’s first shot in the game came more than 20 minutes in, and its two shots on goal through the first 80 minutes came on free kicks from long range. Harvard’s defense, led by imposing first-year center back Jade Rose, did a good job of limiting the air space of dangerous forwards Hannah Curtin and Allie Winstanley on the counter-attack. Winstanley got on the board in the 86th minute, as she pounced on a rebound inside the six-yard box and deposited it into the back of the net. But it was too little too late, and while Dartmouth ended up registering 11 shots, the most the Crimson has allowed in Ivy League play, five of those efforts were blocked.
Later Saturday, Brown (11-3-0, 6-0-0) clinched its second consecutive Ivy League title with a 1-0 win over Penn. The Bears will be headed to the NCAA Tournament, but it remains to be seen whether Princeton, Harvard, or both will join them. The Crimson will look to bolster its resume and end the regular season with a win next Saturday at Columbia (9-5-1, 3-3-0).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 13/9 Harvard found the net early and often against Bentley on Saturday night in the first men’s hockey game at Bright-Landry Hockey Center in over 600 days, cruising to a 7-3 win over the Falcons. Powered by a five-goal first period, the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 ECAC) built a lead too insurmountable for Bentley (3-4, 1-1 Atlantic Hockey) to overcome. Together with Friday’s 9-3 win over ECAC rival Dartmouth, Harvard’s two blowout victories helped it ascend in both the USCHO and USA Today polls and set up a marquee rivalry matchup with No. 15/14 Cornell on Nov. 5.
For the second consecutive night, the Crimson scored inside the first two minutes. After sophomore forward John Farrell funneled a puck towards net, junior forward John Farinacci managed to collect it before it reached the goal, elude the defense, and tuck it past Bentley’s sophomore goaltender Nicholas Grabko for a 1-0 lead. Junior defenseman Henry Thrun added an assist on the play — his first of five on the night. Having already tallied a goal and two assists on Friday, the five-assist performance brought Thrun to a whopping eight points on the weekend.
“[Thrun] is picking up after a really strong freshman year,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He was excellent in the World Juniors, and I think right from the outset has been a leader for us. His calling card a little bit as a player is still being a solid two-way defenseman.”
Special teams again played a huge role for the Crimson as the power play picked up where it left off from the night before against Dartmouth. Still within the first five minutes, Farrell connected on a one-timer to cap a play of tic-tac-toe passing from Thrun with a secondary assist from junior forward Nick Abruzzese.
“Looking at their [penalty] kill before the game, we saw that there might be an opening there to skip that pass through the seam,” Farrell said. “So [I] kind of made eye contact and saw it was going to swing over. I just tried to put it on net, because from that angle, it can be tough for the goalie to react to anything.”
Before the first period’s end, Farrell notched a second power-play goal, again assisted by Abruzzese and Thrun, to make the score 5-1. By night’s end, the Crimson had gone 2-for-5 on the power-play, following up on a 3-for-6 performance from the previous night against the Big Green.
Harvard’s fifth goal, coming with 55 seconds remaining in the opening frame, both capped an explosive period and stemmed any Falcons momentum. Shortly after Harvard’s fourth, Bentley found its stride in the transition game, generating an odd-man rush off a mishandled Crimson blue-line pass. Graduate forward Phil Knies settled the rush before picking out sophomore defenseman Drew Bavaro, who made no mistake with the incisive feed, finishing past junior goalie Mitchell Gibson on a breakaway. Despite the smart finish by Bavaro, Bentley did not manage to make it to the locker room with the last laugh thanks to the Harvard power play.
In the first, Gibson mostly held down the fort in net for Harvard, backing first-period penalty kills with a series of well-controlled saves. By period’s end, he had made eight saves, and on the night, Gibson contributed 18 saves on 21 shots on goal.
Grabko, however, did not return for the second period after surrendering five goals on 14 shots. Junior goalie Jason Grande entered the game as a replacement, and the Falcons seemed to respond to the change. Just 1:33 into the second, Bentley cut the deficit to 5-2 after a Knies strike. Bavaro provided the secondary assist to get to two points as well. Graduate Kohei Sato would join Knies and Bavaro with multiple points on the night for the Falcons.
With the margin back within three, Crimson sophomore forward Alex Laferriere scored his first career goal, picking up a ricochet off the end boards and depositing it into an open net, and from that point forward, the Falcons did not draw within less than four again.
“It was a good win for us. Obviously, a Bentley team that's been dangerous this year, you know, winning at Ohio State and against [Boston College],” Ted Donato said. “We certainly have some things that we need to improve on, but a lot of good signs, and I think anytime you can win the first two games of the season, that's a great start.”
Harvard thought it had claimed a 7-2 lead when senior forward Jack Donato made a high tip off a point shot. The play went to a video review and was overturned for high-sticking as it was determined that Donato had made contact with the puck above the crossbar. First-year forward Matthew Coronato, however, did complete the Crimson touchdown with a highlight-reel, do-it-yourself strike.
The Falcons added the lone goal of the third period when Sato slid the puck along the ice from the blue line before it deflected off of Thrun’s foot and into the back of the net. As the score settled at 7-3, neither team would find the goal again for the final 11:30 of gameplay, although three penalties did fill the last few minutes. On the night, Thrun led the way for Harvard with five points (zero goals, five assists), followed by Farrell’s four points (two goals, two assists) and Abruzzese’s three points (zero goals, three assists).
The Crimson will return to action next Friday night with a rivalry matchup against the Cornell Big Red. In 2019-20, Cornell defeated Harvard once before the Crimson and Big Red skated to a tie at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y. Cornell boasted No. 2/2 and No. 1/1 rankings heading into each of those matchups with Harvard, but on Nov. 5, Harvard will enter with the slight edge in the polls in what promises to be a pivotal early-season matchup in the ECAC.
“Can't wait to get started. [Cornell is] the type of game that you miss in the year and a half you don't have,” Abruzzese said. “No doubt about it our biggest rival, and the rink should be pretty full. .... It's gonna be a good crowd, good energy — this is the kind of game you play for. And I'm really excited to see how we come out and play.”

Dear Harvard Department of Scheduling Breaks or Whatever Acronym You Call Yourself,
With Indigenous People’s Day long behind us and Thanksgiving break feeling way too far away, I can't help but be envious of all the students at other colleges who got to escape campus for a week for their fall break. It’s been months here in captivity without any non-Harvard interaction. I’d never admit it, but I do miss my brother back home. So why? Why can’t you give us a fall break? We don’t ask for much: just a River House, food that has decent seasoning, and a fall break. Is that too much to ask for?
So here’s my desperate attempt to convince you we need a fall break. Please.
One day off is NOT enough
It is sad that the only fall ‘break’ we get is a single day of observance of Indigenous People’s Day. This long-weekend is such a welcome break that so many chose to flee campus and go home, even if it’s just for an extra day. But even at home you can’t catch a break. There’s last-minute assignments to make up for Monday’s missed classes and then make up sections and then emails. So even when you are off campus, you are still working. The work HAUNTS you. It’s not a break. It’s just another day to procrastinate. It is hell.
Too Burnt Out to Go On
After continuously working or mainly thinking about all the work you have to do for over half a semester, you start to lose it. Just look at the progression of the number of joyous students on Dean Khurana’s Instagram (hint: it’s a downward trend). I’m so tired at this point in the semester, I can barely do my laundry. It wouldn’t look good if word got out that Harvard students smelled. We are dangerously close.
Thanksgiving is Too Far Away
Thanksgiving still feels so far, you’ll finally get that CAMHS appointment you requested two months ago before it comes around. As motivation to study for your midterm tomorrow, you need that extra push, that reminder that there’s light at the end of the tunnel. But the tunnel is so long. At this point, Thanksgiving seems more like a fever dream than an actual vacation. All I ask is we be like the Canadians and do our Thanksgiving in October.
We Deserve Happiness
Psst… I’m going to let you in on a little secret — WE ARE EXHAUSTED. As we all figure out how to get through this semester, four additional days of break is just a small scheduling change for unlimited happiness. So please Harvard Department of Scheduling Breaks — do better next year 😭😭
Sincerely,
Namira Mehedi
