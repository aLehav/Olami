After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week the Harvard Allston Task Force, a neighborhood advocacy group, released a wish list in connection with the construction of Tata Hall, a new Harvard Business School complex that will serve HBS’s Executive Education program. Their suggestions included preferential hiring of Allston residents for construction jobs, continuation of the Harvard Allston Education Portal past its possible expiration in 2018, more green space in the area, and clearer access to the Charles River.
These complaints mask the larger issue at hand. The truth is, neither a more Allston-friendly Tata Hall, nor any of Harvard’s community relations efforts—most prominently the Allston Education Portal and the HBS Innovation Lab—will really solve Allston’s problems or appease Allston residents. Instead, what is needed is a holistic plan for Allston development, moving forward.
Harvard-Allston tension has continued for so long that it is easy to forget where it started, and who was to blame in those initial interactions. From the late 80s to early 90s, Harvard bought up significant tracts of land in Allston, under the name of proxy companies, likely so it would not have bargain with the inflated prices that come with its name. In the late 90s, Harvard announced its acquisitions, to the dismay of many in Boston community, including longtime Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Then, the University made amends and announced construction of a massive, $1-billion Science Complex across the river. The Science Complex, it said, would revitalize Allston and bring the community better jobs and a higher standard of life.
However, in 2009, hard-hit by the recession, the University announced it was slowing down construction of the Science Complex, and eventually halted it altogether. Now, the barren space where the erstwhile Science Complex would have been is called the “Western Avenue” foundation in University communications, indicating how much times have changed.
With this history in mind, it is easy to understand why many Allston residents continuously complain against every University action. What they want, as articulated in the Tata Hall letter, is “a clear understanding of how and when future planning, development, and land acquisition by Harvard might occur.”
And why shouldn’t they have it, by now? In mid-June, the Harvard Allston Work Team, an advisory group comprised of University deans, faculty, and alumni, released much-anticipated recommendations for Allston development. The group suggested that Harvard, “develop a commercially oriented research park, expanding faculty and graduate housing, and constructing a redesigned Science Complex.”
Now that the brightest of the brightest have had their say, how much more research is needed? Will the University undertake significant construction in Allston in the near future? Or is now just not the right time, financially, for the University to commit to further building? Whatever the case, the Allston and Harvard communities deserve a clearer response to the Work Team report—which came out during the summer, when much of the community was away on summer vacation—and a fuller understanding of the University’s ability and will for Allston construction.
These questions will likely have difficult answers. But the surveying, polling, consulting, and advising, has gone on for a sufficiently long time. It has been nearly three years since the demise of the original Science Complex plan. What is the future of Allston?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As you probably have heard—unless you are living under a rock whose wifi connection was knocked out by Hurricane Irene—President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress on Thursday evening. You might think this would be the one occasion on which partisanship would be put aside in favor of improving job prospects of ordinary Americans and literature concentrators. Were you to think that, however, I’ve got some Orioles World Series tickets that I think you’d love to buy.
Obama initially requested to address Congress on Wednesday, the first day that Congress returns from its summer recess, which the lawmakers desperately needed to recover from the arduous work of destroying the nation’s credit rating.  Unfortunately, that day happens to coincide with one of 20 Republican presidential debates (Obama claims that he did not foresee this conflict, as he thought it was merely an infomercial for L’Oreal products). Boehner denied Obama’s request, citing “security” difficulties, becoming the first Speaker of the House to ever deny a president’s request to address Congress and the first human being to reach near-perfect resemblance to a disgruntled potato. Astonishingly, it was Obama who blinked first, and the speech was rescheduled for Thursday. That Obama had once again diminished the presidency was clear to everyone other than Michelle and Malia (Sasha made a brief appearance on the “O’Reilly Factor” to call her father a “spineless jellyfish”).
So what have we learned?
Lesson one is that the media really needs to find a hobby. Knitting, lawn bowling, shark wrangling—I’m not particular (although Ann Coulter should really take up shark wrangling).  It needs to do anything other than use its “gotcha” powers to take down Obama. After all, he has more problems than an SAT prep course offered by Anthony Weiner: months pass without the unemployment rate dropping even a bit, he’s constantly accused of being a socialist, and he wasn’t invited to the Kardashian wedding.  Whether pointing out that the President’s scheduling was petty or inept or both, lambasting Obama for not facing down Boehner, or blaming him for the cancelation of Arrested Development, every political persuasion has something nasty to say about the President.
In fact, the press has gotten so bad that I almost jumped on Sarah Palin’s bus and deep-fried an economics textbook before I remembered that as an Ivy League Commie Pinko Who Some Day Aspires To Marry Her Prius With Jane Lynch As The Maid Of Honor, I’m supposed to be on the side of the lamestream media. But I’m also supposed to be on Obama’s side! Mom and Dad are asking me to choose between them, and all I really want is to be adopted by some stranger with even a smidgeon of common sense (Al Roker is the only one who comes to mind right now).
And that’s when I learned lesson two, which is the far more important lesson.  The media hasn’t gotten this all wrong.  It’s just like the old saying—even a broken clock is right twice a day (though it’s still the case that Donald Trump is always wrong).  They’ve sensationalized a silly incident and blown it out of proportion, but if you look past the trees and take in the forest, the press is accurately reflecting the fact that Barack Obama has lost our trust and maybe even our respect. At every turn he has been bullied by an opposition bent on his defeat rather than our nation’s best interests, and at every turn he has tried to meet them half way. As a result, we’re at least halfway to economic disaster and picking up speed by the minute.
As despicable as it can be, the media should not be ignored. Theirs is a subtle genius, what with their ability to look beyond the smoke and noise pouring out of Libya to focus on Chaz Bono’s appearance on Dancing with People Who are Related to the Stars. So while the specific coverage of the jobs speech may indeed be as meaningless as Lindsay Lohan’s position on Palestinian statehood (she was against it before she was for it before she drove into a parked car), the undercurrent of dissatisfaction with Obama is not.
Where are the Obamas of yesteryear?  We need that guy from the campaign.  We need a little Rick Perry oratory from a man who hasn’t had a lobotomy. We need Barack Obama to step up and become a leader.
And he should start by bringing back Arrested Development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of the discussion about the post-9/11 balance between national security and individual rights is as polarized as much of our public discourse is. On one hand are those who argue that the threat of terrorism is vastly exaggerated, that fear-mongering is used to deprive Americans of their basic rights, and terrorists could be dealt with as yet another kind of criminal—by the police and tried in civilian courts. On the other hand are those who argue that the greatest danger the nation ever faced is the combination of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, that those who oppose reasonable security measures are aiding and abetting the enemy, and that torture and extraordinary renditions have been vital in aborting major additional attacks on our homeland.
If one moves away from such one-sided, simplistic, overarching positions, one realizes that we face two major legitimate goals—national security and a lawful government based on individual rights—and that neither can or should trump the other, and that the tension between these goals can be worked out. Moreover, this key thesis is reflected in our Constitution, specifically in the Fourth Amendment. It avoids the absolute language of the First Amendment–“Congress shall make NO law”—and holds instead that there be no unreasonable search and seizure. That is, the framers of the Constitution recognized that some searches do not violate rights and are fully legal and legitimate. And they stipulated a criterion for determining which are acceptable: those that a reasonable person will recognize as proper. Needless to say, such recognition changes over time—for instance, after events that reformulate our national psyche, such as 9/11.
One next recognizes that the right to live is the most basic right. This is the case because all other rights are contingent on this one, while the right to live is not contingent on the others. It seems all too simple to state that dead people cannot exercise their rights, yet it bears repeating because the extensive implications of this observation are often ignored: When the right to live is violated because basic security is not provided, all other rights are undermined—but not vice versa. One further notes that the special status of the right to live is reflected in the criminal codes of all democratic nations, which punish taking someone else’s life—murder—more severely than practically all other crimes, including the violation of property rights, discrimination, and harassment. Hence, providing basic security— not avoiding all risks, but allowing people to feel secure in their homes and in public spaces—is essential and primary.
One next examines various security measures, each on the basis of their reasonableness, rather than condemning or embracing them wholesale. A key example of a security measure that seems eminently reasonable follows. Before cyberspace existed, the authorities could present evidence to show that they had probable cause to suspect that a given person posed a security risk and gain the permission of the court to tap that person’s phone (typically his only phone). Since then, people have obtained a large variety of new and diverse communications devices. In 2001, the Patriot Act changed the specifications of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretaps regarding particularity from one instrument to one person. Evidence still must be presented to the court, and authorities still must show probable cause and individualized suspicion. All that happened here is that law enforcement authorities were finally allowed to catch up with technological development.
Another reasonable new measure changed search warrants from local to national when dealing with the internet. E-mail is often is stored remotely on the servers of Internet service providers (ISPs). Under old laws, search warrants applied only to the jurisdiction where the search will take place. This meant that if a suspect in, say, New Jersey had e-mail stored on a server located in, say, Silicon Valley, an agent would have to travel across the country to obtain a warrant to seize the e-mail in the jurisdiction where the server was located. The Patriot Act allowed a judge in the district with jurisdiction over the crime under investigation to grant search warrants to seize electronic communications stored outside that judge’s jurisdiction.
In contrast, a measure that seriously challenges the notion of “reasonableness” is the violation of habeas corpus by holding people for years on end without trial or hearing. There is no reason detainees should not be brought before authorities composed of judges that have security clearances and follow procedures suited for dealing with terrorists.  They could determine, say every year or so, whether the person can be further detained.
Finally, there are some measures that are clearly beyond the pale. Terrorists are entitled to select basic human rights by virtue of being human. Although terrorists should be treated as abusive civilians who have forfeited many of their rights, certain basic rights should be considered inviolate. They should not be killed when they can be safely detained and held, nor should they be subjected to torture.
The greatest difficulty I have is coming to terms with the need to prevent rather than prosecute. Security requires that the primary goal of dealing with terrorists be preventing attacks rather than prosecuting the perpetrators after the attack has occurred. This is particularly evident when we deal with terrorists who may acquire weapons of mass destruction. It also holds for many terrorists who are willing to commit suicide during their attack and hence clearly cannot be tried, and who are not going to pay mind to what might be done to them after their assault. Even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often “true believers” who are willing to proceed despite whatever the legal system may throw at them, after the fact. All these kinds—those who may use WMDs, the suicide bombers, and the “mere” fanatics—are best prevented from proceeding rather than vainly trying to prosecute them, and most cannot be effectively deterred by the criminal justice system. However, the prevention of attacks often requires maintaining surveillance on large numbers of individuals and then maintaining dossiers on them—a highly troubling condition.
The best I can suggest, as I struggle with this and other such attempts to find a reasonable balance between rights and security, is to put into place strong review boards that will serve to ensure that when the government is granted new powers, they are used only for the legitimate purposes of enhancing security and only when we face clear and present danger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On June 25, gay and lesbian New Yorkers filled the streets of Greenwich Village drunk with joy. They walked up Christopher Street, passing Sylvia Rivera Way, blissfully unaware of the fact that in 1969, this transgender woman was one of the drag queens and street kids who fought back against the police in the Stonewall Riots, which are widely regarded as the start of the modern gay rights movement. And, as they crowded into Stonewall to have celebratory drinks, few gave much thought to the fact that the people who fought back in that very bar 42 years ago are still being left behind in the dust.
As New York joined Massachusetts in the ranks of marriage equality, it also joined in having the unfortunate distinction of once again failing to pass the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, or GENDA. The rapid advances in equality for gay and lesbian Americans are not being matched by advances in transgender equality, and we are too eager to turn away from our transgender partners in struggle.
To be sure, some may question what transgender equality has to do with equality for gay men and lesbians. (Indeed, that was the question Harvard’s Papadopoulos lecture asked in 2010, entitled “Do Transsexuals Dream of Gay Rights? The Struggle for an Inclusive Queer Movement.”) Aside from the common starting point, our struggles have many intersections. In fact, the lead attorney trying to overturn California’s Proposition 8, Shannon Price Minter, was a transgender man who works for the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
Transgender people can also be gay or lesbian, and, especially with regards to transgender men, many of them identified as queer women before coming out once more. Moreover, regardless of their currently legally defined gender, or their gender identity, or the gender they were assigned at birth, nationwide marriage equality would give transgender people the right to marry freely, without fear of that relationship status changing or being invalidated. (Current laws on transgender people marrying vary state by state.)
However, that is not enough. In a recent article in The New Republic, Eliza Gray pointed out that the success of a civil rights movement depends on its members being recognized as human by the majority. Gay and lesbian Americans, she says, are winning rights because as more people come out, more Americans know someone who is gay or lesbian. It becomes harder to deny someone you know rights. According to Gray’s calculations, however, there are only 700,000 transgender Americans—many of whom are closeted in the workplace and other situations for fear of discrimination. “They are invisible in a way that other minorities are not,” she wrote.
Indeed, that holds true at Harvard and around the country. In Washington, the Human Rights Campaign—a  largely ineffective organization that prides itself on having the same legislative priority in 2011 as it did in 1989—is still working on passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. The Act would prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2006, Democrats, including Representative Barney Frank ’62, agreed to leave out gender identity protections from the bill, arguing that it would offer the bill a greater chance of passing. The bill still failed to pass both chambers, and Frank and the Human Rights Campaign were humiliated by their decision to leave out a vital part of the LGBT community—particularly because the HRC had promised, in 2004, to only support a trans-inclusive bill.
Indeed, after New York’s marriage equality bill passed this summer, I witnessed an exchange between two gay men involved in state government. At a celebratory function, one congratulated the other, asking what he would have to work on now that their top priority had been passed. “GENDA?” he asked, teasing his friend. “GENDA,” the other man replied, rolling his eyes. In New York and Massachusetts, the advance of marriage equality has taken attention and money away from a statewide bill offering protections based on gender identity.
At Harvard, we saw this debate play out firsthand last year, over the return of the Reserve Officers Training Corps to campus after the end of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, while the military would continue to discriminate against able-bodied transgender Americans. One gay male student asked me why we would want to ally ourselves with a group that is even more despised than us. Even the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, an umbrella group which purports to represent the entire LGBT community, failed to take transgender equality into consideration. They did not make note of the military’s trans-exclusion policy until after the repeal of DADT, and only after President Faust made a good-faith promise to allow its return to campus after the repeal.
At Harvard, we often talk about being trapped in a bubble. The return of ROTC to campus burst that bubble with regards to indifference towards transgender equality, and we can no longer claim blissful ignorance. If we take seriously the inscription on Dexter Gate that we depart this university to serve better our country and our kind, we must take care to remember those who are often forgotten and keep local and national organizations focused on protecting us all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing a tradition begun more than 35 years ago by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, Wednesday teas will return this evening to Sparks House. Gomes, who died this past February, opened his official residence once a week as a gathering place for members of the Harvard community.
“This has become a great Harvard tradition. One of professor Gomes’ legacies is to help this place cherish traditions,” said Memorial Church Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz. “The most important thing about the tea was the consummate hospitality. He created an environment that was welcoming to students and the community.”
Gomes—who was known to take an interest in the lives of students—began the teas in 1974.
“It picks you up at a flabby part of the day. I love having people at my house and I love having them on this occasion.” Gomes told the Harvard Gazette in 2009. “I also like trying to figure out who’s here. There are boys, girls, old people, young people—you never know who’s going to show up.”
Katz said that although there were concerns about continuing tea without Gomes, the Church thought that it was important to maintain the tradition.
“It was so much a part of the ministry that was his,” Katz said. “While it was something that was very closely tied to him, on some level it had taken on a life of its own.”
Katz said that past attendees of the weekly teas may be surprised to see the new interior of Sparks House. Once filled with Gomes’ eclectic collection of antiques, photographs, and artwork, the decorations in the official residence are now more sparse.
Gomes’ belongings were removed from the house this past summer.
The staff of the church moved furniture and decorations from the Memorial Church to try fill the void. Katz said that he hopes the house will eventually display paintings from the Fogg Museum.
“The space will look different, but it will still be an extension of Memorial Church’s ministry space,” Robert J. Mark, an assistant chaplain at the church.
In the past, Gomes functioned mostly as a greeter, embracing visitors at the door and making them feel welcome. This role will be filled by members of the Memorial Church staff, Katz said. The two greeters will vary week by week.
“One of the many things that he’s taught me is to know people’s names and make them feel welcome as individuals,” Mark said. “I will miss that incredible personal touch that he brought. He’s given us a great example of hospitality.”
Joined by Christine E. Whiteside, administrative assistant at the Church, Mark will be one of the tea’s first greeters.
“I’m deeply honored and looking forward to it,” Mark said. “But in no way do I pretend to be filling anyone’s shoes.”
Other changes to the tea include allowing guests to pour their own tea. In the past, tea pourers were assigned the task of pouring tea for the guests.

Contract negotiations between SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard security guards, and Securitas, the contractor for security guards, took a dramatic turn this week when SEIU leadership criticized the new health care plan proposed by Securitas, saying the plan would cost workers more, and provide them less care.
The security guards’ current contract expires next Friday.
According to Local 615 Director for Higher Education Wayne M. Langley, guards currently are provided full health care coverage, but Securitas’ proposed plan would only offer partial coverage.
He also noted that even though the plan does not provide as many benefits to workers, it is actually more expensive, costing them between $200 and $500 per month.
“With this plan, we are getting less in the way of health benefits while paying more,” Langley said. “We don’t understand why they made this proposal—it’s not better for anyone.”
Other leaders within SEIU—the Service Employees International Union—said that they view Securitas’ proposed health care plan as unacceptable.
“The fact that Securitas is trying to take away some of the health benefits, people are saying that’s just non-negotiable,” said SEIU publicist Nancy B. Kohn. “Members are angry about the way Securitas is bargaining.”
Harvard declined to comment on the contract negotiations, while Securitas did not immediately respond for comment.
Langley said that the health care proposal shook up what had been a relatively uneventful contract negotiation, which have now taken a “confrontational tone.”
According to union leaders, there are a number of possible outcomes if the union and Securitas are not able to come to an agreement before next Friday.
“Option number one is to let the contract expire,” Langley said. “Option two is file an extension. Option three is to take some sort of action, like a strike. Which of those happens depends a lot on what happens on the next four [bargaining] days.”
Kohn said any course of action will also depend on the sentiment of SEIU membership.
“The negotiating committee really doesn’t want to get ahead of the members,” she said.
In addition to health care, the Union is stressing several other key issues in the negotiations, the largest of which are full-time employment and increased educational benefits for security guards.
“Full-time work supports a family, and allows you to spend time with your family,” Langley said.
He added that workers employed directly by the University are able to take free or discounted classes through Harvard and associated colleges, and that SEIU wants this same right for security guards employed through Securitas.
“We want no second class citizens at Harvard,” Langley said.

CORRECTION: SEPT. 14, 2011
An earlier version of the Sept. 14 story "Union Rejects Securitas Health Care Proposal" included a headline that incorrectly described the proposed health care plan as a University plan when, in fact, the proposal was made by the private security firm Securitas.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences successfully decreased its budget deficit by more than half in the last fiscal year—reducing the remaining gap from $35 million to just $16 million—several FAS administrators said yesterday.
The new deficit figure was revealed at a meeting late last week with Leslie A. Kirwan, dean of Administration and Finance for FAS. Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith is expected to announce the number at the Oct. 4 Faculty meeting, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
The recent drop matched a prediction voiced by Smith at a Faculty meeting last May, one month before the conclusion of the fiscal year.
The deficit decline also marks a further development as the school approaches a balanced budget—a goal which Smith has promised will occur by fiscal year 2012.
Some administrators said they are sanguine that FAS might even post a surplus this year.
In December 2008, Smith stood in front of a packed Faculty Room in University Hall for his monthly Faculty Room in University Hall for his monthly Faculty meeting, asking departments to cut budgets by 10 to 15 percent. For the last two years, Smith has been leading the charge to shrink the FAS deficit, decreasing the original $220 million gap by half at the end of the 2009 fiscal year, and by an additional two thirds by the end of FY10.
Though the operating budget of FAS had decreased from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2008 to $1.1 billion this year, the budget will be slightly stronger in fiscal year 2012 due to a 4 percent increase in the distribution the school will receive from the University endowment.
Several administrators have said that in the face of cuts already enacted, the remaining $16 million offers a less concerning challenge.
But senior executives, including Kirwan, are concerned that the environment of more severe budget cutting might return, according to administrators who attended last week’s meeting.
“They don’t know how long [the increased payout] will last,” said one FAS administrator, who wished to remain anonymous to preserve relationships with central administration.
The administrator noted that last month’s volatile market movements have particularly increased concerns that the endowment value may again drop in the coming year.
That would only further complicate FAS’ current financial situation. While the school is on track to meet Smith’s goal of having a balanced budget by the end of this fiscal year, FAS is still facing long-term debt obligations.
Some administrators were unsure how the school planned to pay back its debt, but pointed to a combined reliance on the FAS reserves, which stood at $138 million in 2008, and funding from the University’s capital campaign.
In the last Faculty meeting of the previous academic year, Smith struck a more optimistic note than he had in previous years.
“It's good news,” he said at the May meeting, even lightly joking about the return of two-year-long absent cookies to the meeting.

Undocumented students at Harvard and colleges across the U.S. will not have to worry about immediate deportation due to an executive order issued by the Obama administration in August.
The administration will review approximately 300,000 deportation cases, putting some to rest if the immigrants involved are deemed “non-threatening.” Many deportation proceedings for immigrant students are expected to be suspended indefinitely.
“I’m very happy about this decision, but it doesn’t affect or change anything at all,” said an undocumented Divinity School student who also attended the College. He asked to remain anonymous to avoid legal ramifications for his family.
“In a way I feel more secure, not safe, but more secure,” the student said. “I think safety comes out of a sense of danger, but I’ve never felt in danger in the United States. Security comes out a sense of permanence, a grounding in the United States.”
An undocumented undergraduate who asked that his name not be used to protect his identity said he had mixed feelings about the decision.
“This is good because I don’t think [undocumented] people should be deported,” he said. “Ultimately the state would end up losing money and human capital, but from an ethical point, some people should be [deported], maybe I should turn myself in.”
But Eric Balderas ’13—an undocumented student who was detained in June 2010 but given a three-year suspension of his deportation hearing—was doubtful that the new order will have lasting effects.
“I’m very skeptical about it because of all the politics behind it,” Balderas said. “Obama said before that there was nothing in his executive power he could do to circumvent Congress on this issue, so I’m not too sure about it. I don’t feel any more secure because of it. There have been some cases that have been dropped, but I need to see more dropped to make sure that this isn’t a political ploy.”
Nicolas E. Jofre ’13—head of Act on a Dream, a student organization that advocates for immigration reform—said this recent decision will come as a relief to some undocumented students.
“One of the great things about this executive decision is that because pending cases of students will be deemed low priority, Harvard students will not have to worry about having to permanently leave the country during their four years here,” Jofre said.
Harvard previously supported legislation resolving the status issues of undocumented students. University President Drew G. Faust was a vocal supporter of the unsuccessful Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act when it came up for vote in Congress last winter.
“We are hopeful that this federal policy change will allow hardworking students at Harvard and other universities to focus on their studies,” Christine Heenan, the vice president for public affairs and communications, wrote in an email. “We remain committed to enactment of the DREAM Act to resolve the status issues for many students and other young people interested in serving the country through military service.”

Hoping to highlight opposition to a proposed oil pipeline running from Canada to the Gulf Coast, protesters gathered outside of Kirkland House Tuesday afternoon before the arrival of Jim Messina, President Obama’s campaign manager.
About 50 protesters assembled in opposition to the TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline, which is being considered by the Obama Administration. Chanting “Obama Stop the Pipeline—Yes he can!” the protesters demonstrated growing liberal unrest about the President’s environmental initiatives.
“We decided we wanted to make some noise to show Obama that people are angry about this issue,” said Sachi M. Oshima ’13, co-chair of the Harvard Environmental Action Committee. “He has the executive power to prevent this—it doesn’t have to go through Congress. It is solely his decision.”
The on-campus protest follows several demonstrations at the end of August conducted by national environmental advocacy organizations, during which more than 1,200 protesters were arrested outside of the White House.
“We wanted to bring the protest here, and bring awareness to campus,” Oshima said.
The protesters, largely comprising Harvard undergraduates, stood in Kirkland’s courtyard waiting for Messina. As he passed by the crowd, heading for the Kirkland Junior Common Room, protesters chanted, “What do we want? Renewable energy! When do we want it? Now!”
Messina came to Harvard for an off-the-record discussion with students as part of the ongoing “Conversations with Kirkland.”
The protest was organized in large part by the EAC, but members of the EAC tapped into national activist networks for help.
“We decided that we wanted to show solidarity with some of the other protests going on around the country by doing a smaller scale protest here on campus,” said Rebecca J. Cohen ’12.
If approved by Obama, the Keystone XL pipeline would span 1,700 miles from Alberta, Canada to Gulf Coast delivery points in Texas and Oklahoma. In all, the pipeline would run through Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, before final delivery points in both Oklahoma and Texas. The project is undergoing a 90-day review period during which the Department of State will accept public comments on the matter. According to a Department of State Executive Report, a final decision is expected in December of this year.
The pipeline project request was first filed by TransCanada in September 2008, before then-candidate Obama’s election.
As the White House gears up for the 2012 election, demonstrations, like the one in Kirkland House, signal the potential challenge Obama may face when trying to motivate his base.
Student protesters expressed apprehension about supporting Obama Tuesday.
“I’m undecided. I think I do, but there’s a possibility I could go Green Party or with another candidate if Obama doesn’t follow through with his environmental standards,” said Canyon S. Woodward ’15.
Fourteen of the Kirkland House protesters were arrested outside of the White House last month. Craig S. Altemose, a 2010 joint degree graduate from Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School, was one of the demonstrators arrested.
“We wanted to make Obama realize that if he wants our votes, he probably has them. But if he wants our cash and our volunteer hours—if he wants to actually have people believe in him and be passionate supporters—then he needs to stop this pipeline,” he said.
Oshima echoed his comments.
“Our protest is to hold Obama accountable to the environmental goals he set forth in his inauguration speech and when he was campaigning in ’08,” she said. “Our goal right now is to tell Obama is that as young voters, we want to support him, but we don’t know if we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff ’75 called for Congress to build a legal framework for dealing with the complexity of modern security threats in a lecture on Tuesday.
The talk, titled “The Law of 9/11: Reflections by former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff,” came two days after the tenth anniversary of 9/11. It was sponsored by the Harvard Law School chapter of The Federalist Society, a group of conservative, moderate, and libertarian students.
From 2005 to 2009 Chertoff served as head of the Department of Homeland Security at a post created by former President George W. Bush in the wake of 9/11.
At the time of the attacks, Chertoff, a graduate of Harvard Law School, was chief of the Justice Department’s criminal division.
“There were points in that morning where we seriously thought there was a possibility of eight, nine, ten, a dozen jets crashing into American buildings and killing not only the passengers on the plane, but the people in the buildings themselves,” he said.
Uncertainty and a lack of information created “a real sense of urgency in proceeding forward,” Chertoff said.
“You may see things like this in movies, but let me tell you it’s a lot different when you see them in video conferencing. You hear people talking about the fact that American fighters are going to be ordered to shoot down American passenger planes on American territory,” he said.
Chertoff then segued into a discussion of the flaws in national defense policy exposed by the 9/11 attacks.
Before 9/11, the government had organized itself according to a “binary view of security,” Chertoff said. Threats were either labelled as war or crime, two categories that have separate agencies, doctrines, and laws.
Globalization, technological advances, and the rise of “ungoverned space” since the Cold War have contributed to the deterioration of the applicability of a binary view of security, according to Chertoff.
The “eroded limits of a nation-state” and the ability to travel, communicate, and send money around the world gives networks “more global reach, often equal to or exceeding that of a nation.” Such groups now have access to biotechnology and radioactive material and are thus capable of widespread destruction, according to Chertoff.
He also cautioned that the rise of “ungoverned space” in countries like Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan allows groups to build laboratories, recruiting centers, and training camps without fear of law enforcement.
“Depending on the nature of the technology and the nature of the global reach of the particular threat, the consequences of [groups’] acts may be equal to or greater than what we experience in conventional wars,” Chertoff said.
He called on Congress to address the legal gap between the criminal justice system and wartime policy, arguing that a lack of clear legislation has left the government with antiquated, Cold War-era guidelines for dealing with the new threat of terrorism. Congressional silence has also forced the judicial branch to apply traditional laws to a modern security landscape.
According to Chertoff, the government needs “fine-grained analysis” of the current security threats to produce a “legal architecture” capable of dealing with current security issues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you're frustrated with the NBA lockout and craving a game to watch, your solution might be nearer than you think. Later this month, Penn’s historic basketball arena, the Palestra, will hold an event that will showcase NBA players that even Ivy League students might know.
The setup will be simple: Team Philly vs. Team Melo. Team Melo will boast of many of the NBA’s top acts, including the New York Knick’s newly acquired Carmelo Anthony, the New Orleans Hornets’ point guard Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s superstar Kevin Durant, and the player everyone loves to hate, the Miami Heat’s Lebron James. Opposing this formidable group is Team Philly, led by the Phoenix Suns’ Hakim Warrick and the Houston Rockets’ Kyle Lowry. Unfortunately—or at least in my opinion, as yours truly hails from Los Angeles—Kobe Bryant has turned down an offer to join Team Philly.
A piece of the profits from this showcase will go to local Philadelphian charities. For anyone interested in making the trek to Philadelphia for the 6 pm tip-off on September 25th, tickets range from $35 to $50 but are going fast.
Around the Ivies ...
Princeton women’s basketball team is starting off the season by shooting from long distance. A very long distance. The Tigers traveled last week to both Paris and Dakar, Senegal, where they played four games over the course of a week. While freshmen weren’t allowed to participate in this trip, the team was granted an earlier pre-season work-out start than usual, which can be used to every body’s advantage. When they were not competing, Princeton’s athletes spent the remainder of its trip visiting local villages, volunteering at an orphanage, and holding basketball clinics. After winning last year’s Ivy League title, the Tigers hope that they can continue their success this season. The team arrived back in New Jersey on Sunday night.
Across the Charles …
Boston  University’s senior Jake O’Brien, the Terrier’s fifth-most leader in blocked shots all-time, received a block of his own on Monday night when he underwent season-ending foot surgery. This was a tough blow for B.U., as O’Brien was looking like the team’s centerpiece for the upcoming season after former star John Holland graduated last May. O’Brien has done well in the past against Harvard, nabbing 18 points and eight rebounds against the Crimson as a freshman, 14 points as a sophomore, and 20 points as a junior. As a result of this surgery, O’Brien will redshirt this season and be granted one more year of playing in 2012-2013.
Around campus …
 
For the fifth consecutive year, Harvard men’s basketball’s coaches will be holding a coaches clinic free of charge to all Harvard students. This daylong experience will entail watching an actual practice led by coach Tommy Amaker, running drills, and hearing a lecture by Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Larry Brown.
 
This will take place from 10 am to 4 pm on October 30th. So even though this event takes place the day before Halloween, throw on some basketball shorts and come out. After all, you might even see the scariest costume yet: Harvard students in athletic gear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a tightly contested fifth set, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (5-2) narrowly topped the University of New Hampshire (0-12) to win its home opener.
Up 13-12 in the decisive final set, the Crimson caught a break when the first referee ruled that an attack attempt grazed a Wildcat player before whizzing out of bounds, giving Harvard a match point opportunity.
The team took advantage as outside hitter junior Taylor Docter killed the ball to slam the door on the visitors.
“The mentality was to just get it done,” co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer said of the team’s attitude down the stretch.  “We weren’t going to let this game get away from us.”
From the outset, the teams were evenly matched, battling back and forth to a 14-12 score midway through the first set, with New Hampshire enjoying the early advantage.
Then, in a play that would foreshadow the hectic finish, the Wildcats pushed their lead to three when the first referee ruled an errant attack touched a Harvard blocker before landing out.
But the Crimson responded by winning 13 of the next 17 points to take the first set 25-19, holding New Hampshire to a first set hitting percentage of .026 in the process.
Despite the Wildcat’s winless record, Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss and the team knew it would be in for a struggle.
“We didn’t even talk about the record,” Weiss said. “New Hampshire has some great blockers and attackers on the outside.”
In the second set, the Wildcats exhibited their resilience by jumping out to a 6-0 lead and holding on to win the set 26-24 after the Crimson tied the score at 24.
Freshman Tara MacLean cited the friendly Malkin Athletic Center in helping Harvard stay calm in pivotal moments of the close match.
“I felt pretty comfortable because this is the gym we practice in so it was more of a comforting feeling playing at home for once.”
MacLean played a big role in regaining control of the momentum in the third set.
With several key blocks and kills, she helped the team win the set 25-21.
Thanks to her strong third set, in addition to key contributions throughout the match, MacLean led the team with 19 kills in her first full match after playing in only one set in Harvard’s first six contests.
After going up two games to one, Harvard was unable to finish the match in the fourth set, registering a match-low of .167 hitting percentage in the frame.
Still fighting, New Hampshire pounced on the opportunity created by the Crimson’s lackluster play.
The Wildcats tallied a .385 hitting percentage and killed 18 balls en route to tying the match at two and setting the stage for a nail-biting fifth set.
For a team with only two seniors, Harvard showed plenty of composure in the fifth set as it attempted to start their five-game home stand off with a win.
The stakes were just as high for New Hampshire, which was looking for its first win.
The teams battled evenly with points punctuated by diving stabs and timely blocks.
But when the game hung in the balance, with the teams tied at 11 apiece, it was the Crimson who stepped up.
After Harvard won two long points to go up 13-11, the Wildcats called a timeout to gather itself for the final push.
In the huddle, Weiss talked specific strategy and made sure her team was confident and composed before sending them back onto the court.
“The team came out in control.” Weiss said. “We knew what they were going to try to run and what we were going to do and we executed the game plan, which was good.”
Even though Harvard escaped with a win, Weiss recognized that there is always room for improvement, especially early in the year.
“We were up and down. We have a lot that we can learn from the match for the matches coming up,” she said.
“Hopefully this match will bring us more confidence and we’ll have a good weekend,” Fryhofer added.
Next up for the Crimson is a match with Holy Cross on Friday to open the Harvard Invitational.
Harvard will then take on Navy and Northeastern on Saturday before beginning their Ivy League slate with a home match the following weekend against another school from New Hampshire, Dartmouth College, on Sept. 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of Harvard’s graduating athletes will be leaving their athletic aspirations behind at the conclusion of the school year in favor of varied pursuits in the real world. But one need look no further than the coaching staff of the Crimson’s cross country and track squads to find a couple of exceptions to this trend.  Far from hanging up their running shoes, Charles Gillespie ’10 and Brian Hill ’11 are now chasing Olympic dreams.
After standout collegiate careers, the pair has rejoined Harvard’s cross country and track teams as volunteer coaches. With their eyes set on the U.S. Olympic Trials, Gillespie and Hill will continue to train with the teams in their new roles.
Hill, who hopes to qualify for the trials in the men’s 800m run, concluded a hallmark All-American campaign for the men’s track team last spring with a spot in the NCAA national championships in the 800m. He also won the Battle of the Beanpot.
Gillespie, who goes by “Chas”, culminated a successful graduate year at the College of William and Mary last spring, utilizing his final year of athletic eligibility to continue running cross country. While with the Tribe, Gillespie was named the Colonial Athletic Association’s Male Cross Country Runner of the Year. Last June, his time in a half-marathon qualified him for a spot in the marathon at the Olympic Trials in January.
Jason Saretsky, head coach of both the Crimson’s cross country and track teams, praised Gillespie and Hill for their work ethic, commitment, and passion for the sport.
“I thought it would be great for our team to be around these guys,” Saretsky said about his decision to invite the two back.
It seems the feeling was mutual, as both Gillespie and Hill view returning to Cambridge as a natural fit.
“There’s no better place [to train] than Harvard,” Hill concurred. “We have the facilities, coaching staff, and the teammates that anybody would die to have.”
Hill and Gillespie have taken less than conventional paths to their standings as elite athletes and Olympic hopefuls.
“We wouldn’t recruit somebody today who ran the times Brian did in high school,” Saretsky said. “For him, it really came down to his commitment. He was the first to show up and the last to leave. We had to kick him out at the end of practice.”
While Hill may not have been a star when he arrived on campus, he was one of  the strongest by the time he graduated. He currently holds the school record in the indoor 800m and the 4x800m relay.
Gillespie’s career has been one of adaptation. He arrived at Harvard focusing on the mile, a relatively short race in the world of distance running. He soon realized that he was a stronger performer at longer distances and shifted gears.
“By my senior year, my best events were the 5000m and the 10000m,” Gillespie said.
“Chas’s key was consistency,” Saretsky noted. “He just continually got better.”
Gillespie, who has sported an engulfing beard since before the look was popularized by the likes of Zach Galifianakis, is propelled by a cool yet unassuming self-assuredness.
“I’ll never forget a meeting we had—I think it was Chas’s junior year,” Coach Saretsky recalled, “he told me he wants to be in a position where he can be our top guy in any given race. Now, we had some pretty good runners besides Chas at the time. But it just shows who he is as a competitor.”
Not content with his race performances last spring, Gillespie decided to attempt even longer distance events.
“Half-marathon was a natural progression,” Gillespie said.
Gillespie turned in a time of 64 minutes and 56 seconds, four seconds better than the 65 minute time needed to qualify for the Olympic trials.
“A lot had to go right,” Gillespie admitted, “but it was amazing.”
Hill and Gillespie are currently roommates living only a few steps from Hill’s old home in Quincy House.
“I see this current situation as the ideal one,” Hill concluded.
Olympic Trials for track and field will not be held until next June. By that time, Hill hopes to post an 800m time better than the soon to be announced qualifying time.
Meanwhile, Gillespie is training for the Marathon Olympic Trials, to be held Jan. 14, in Houston, Texas. It will be his first marathon.
“I wanted to attempt to approach the pinnacle of my capabilities,” Gillespie said, “I think that when you do something that you love, and you really give it everything you have, opportunities open up for you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team (3-1) has good reason to be confident as it hits the road to face Boston University (5-2-1) tonight at 7 p.m.  With weekend wins over UMass and UConn—two teams that have beat the Terriers in the past week—the Crimson looks to tack a third straight loss to the home team’s record.
BU began its season 5-0-1 and posted its best start since 1996, earning a No. 20 ranking before dropping two straight games last weekend and losing its spot on the poll.
This will be Harvard’s first match against a team that has been nationally ranked this season.
“We’re going to treat it as a really good opportunity to show everyone what we can do,” said freshman midfielder Lauren Urke, whose goal and assist in Sunday’s 2-1 victory over UConn earned her Ivy League co-Rookie of the Week honors.
The Crimson has dropped three of its last four contests with BU, including a 3-0 shutout at Ohiri Field last year. Harvard still owns an edge in the all-time series, boasting a 6-3-3 mark.
The Crimson hopes to earn its first road win of the season at Nickerson Field, dropping its only other matchup as a visitor against Long Island University on Sept. 2.
“We come into these games not expecting anything but knowing we have nothing to lose and everything to gain through hard work and 100-percent effort,” Urke said.
Hard work and effort will remain pivotal to the Crimson’s success, but stability in goal will also prove important. After sophomore keeper Jessie Wright was taken to the hospital early in the first half of Sunday’s game against UConn for concussion tests, freshman goalie Cheta Emba had to step in.
Emba had a solid performance, recording four saves and allowing no goals against a UConn team that took 11 shots.
“Cheta was called upon and stepped right into the role and was calm and made sacrifices for the team,” said junior midfielder Alexandra Conigliaro—a Crimson sports comper—who scored the game-winning goal on an assist from Urke on Sunday.
With fellow keepers junior AJ Millet and freshman Bethany Kanten missing this past weekend’s games, Harvard faces uncertainty in the goal.
“We’re going to wait to see who is healthy enough to go. It’s been a crazy couple of games, that’s for sure,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “Jessie Wright is healthy, she is okay, but she is definitely not going to play in the game on Wednesday. But we’re just thankful that she’s okay.”
The keeper that ultimately ends up in goal tonight will face an aggressive Terriers squad. BU outshot UMass, 22-3, in a 1-0 loss on Sunday afternoon.
Harvard’s goalie will need to be especially alert whenever Terrier sophomores Madison Clemens and Megan McGoldrick get near the net, as the two each took five shots in their last game.
Fellow sophomore Kylie Strom and senior Brittany Heist added to the offensive attack with three shots apiece.
BU also boasts the presence of senior Jessica Luscinski, who was voted as the America East 2010 Striker of the Year for her 12 goals and seven assists last season.
She and Taylor Krebs pace the team with three goals each. Strom has chipped in two this season.
Regardless of whoever is in goal for Harvard, her Crimson teammates will not worry about the goalie situation.
“Right now, all of our keepers are amazing, and so with any of them in net, I would feel completely confident about their abilities,” Urke said.
“Having so many injuries in the past couple games has been tough, but no matter who’s in goal, every single goalie has stepped up to the plate,” Conigliaro echoed.
Recognizing that BU’s two straight losses by no means guarantee a victory tonight, Conigliaro added that “the wins so far have been giving us confidence but we know we still have a hard fight for sure.”
Harvard has seen six different players score goals, demonstrating a well-balanced offense led by co-captain Melanie Baskind, who has scored two goals and assisted on two others. She will certainly be targeted by a Terrier defense that has only allowed seven goals in eight games.
“BU is an awesome team. They’re so well-coached,” Leone added. “I’m just excited for the opportunity.”
