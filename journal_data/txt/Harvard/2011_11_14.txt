After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a generation supposedly defined by the War on Terror, our generation’s response to military events now follows a very apathetic and predictable path. Severe skepticism or blind support marks its early stages, followed quickly by transient vicissitudes of euphoria and despair. No matter the route taken—yet particularly when some success is achieved—we inevitably arrive at a state of deep apathy. Of course, an economic crisis tends to cause a nation to turn inward, but long before our economic problems merited the term, Great Recession, Afghanistan and Iraq were, quite simply, no longer that big of a deal.
Therefore, it was no surprise when the far-reaching troop withdrawal in Iraq barely registered over America’s domestic political cacophony. Even worse, only the closest newsreader could have noticed last week’s firing of Major General Peter Fuller, the top US commander in Afghanistan, for his disparaging comments on Afghanistan President, Hamid Karzai. Fuller is no MacArthur, nor even quite a McChrystal, but his firing is still an event of significant importance. The response to these two events was unfortunate not only for its subdued nature, but also because both of these events were—to borrow a modern euphemism—“teachable moments.”
Let’s start off with Fuller. In an interview with Politico on Nov. 3, Fuller accused Afghanistan’s political leaders of being ungrateful for America’s investments, going so far as to say they were “isolated from reality.”  Digging himself an even deeper hole, he suggested about Karzai, “when [Afghans] are going to have a presidential election, you hope they get a guy that’s more articulate in public.” One must wonder whether Fuller, after his firing two days later, could find any irony in his statement about Karzai.
Of course, Fuller only stated what everyone else already knows. Karzai and his fellow cronies have not been trustworthy allies. Military allegations of cooperation between our “allies” and enemies grow daily. The NATO partnership with the man was a marriage of convenience and, as we are only slowly realizing, divorces can be a tricky thing over there.
Most observers are finding it safe to conclude that the latest ‘Surge’ in Afghanistan was more of a dud than a success. Over the last ten years, expectations in Afghanistan have wavered significantly. However, since the disappointing results of the troop surge in Afghanistan and the symbolic death of Osama bin Laden, expectations rest at an all-time low. Once dreaming of a fully functional and tolerant pluralistic democracy, we are now, almost half a trillion dollars later, willing to settle for a façade of security and an iota of economic performance. We did not fail—see Russia’s earlier venture into Afghanistan for an example of a failure—but only a jingoistic fool would call our ten-year experiment an overall success.
That frustrating conclusion is what Fuller’s comments truly signified. Other generals, like Lieutenant General Curtis Scaparrotti, who recently complained about the Pakistani Army’s aiding and protecting Afghan insurgents, are sharing their frustration with press. The military’s inability to achieve full success in Afghanistan may lead to a vexed insecurity, flashes of which are already beginning to show. That would help no one except America’s enemies.
Meanwhile, flashes of a different phenomenon are appearing in Iraq. A few weeks ago, the Obama Administration elected to withdraw all American soldiers by the end of this year, with the exception of 200 Marines to guard the U.S. embassy. In a great irony, acknowledged by few, Obama, to the approval of Democrats and criticism of many Republicans, simply followed the line-by-line of a 2008 agreement signed by the Bush Administration. Seventy five percent of war-fatigued America approved the decision despite statements by Iraqi military officials, like those made by Colonel Salam Khaled to the Washington Post: “Our forces are good, but not to a sufficient degree that allows them to face external and internal challenges alone.”
Despite the fact that the decision appears to have been largely out of Obama’s hands, much ink has been spilled on speculation of his possible motives in ending the war in such definitive fashion. With much less speculation, one can instead learn about today’s military and government by comparing the response to the close of the Iraq war with the 2007 “Surge.”
The only outspoken critics of the full withdrawal were politicians, most prominently Senators McCain and Lieberman, Representative Rubio, and, predictably, all the Republican presidential candidates. Whispers of Secretary of Defense Panetta’s dissatisfaction and murmurs of CIA Director Petraeus’ disapproval paradoxically grew softer through the outlining of the agreement. High-level active and retired generals were unusually quiet as well. Obama’s decision—or, rather, non-decision—was of equal, if not greater, magnitude than Bush’s decision to implement the “Surge.” Yet, the “Surge” was met with vociferous public disapproval and nearly non-stop editorials and television appearances of retired and active generals dismissing the military policy. In fact, both the head of U.S. Central Command at the time, John Abizaid, and America’s top military commander in Iraq at the time, George Casey, dismissed the plan.
Unfortunately, the magnitude of America’s military decisions is very rarely equivalent to the interest of Americans to those decisions. A democracy can only succeed militarily with a skeptical public and appropriately vocal military willing to approve successes and warn against mistakes. It seems that both groups were too tired when it mattered most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A century ago last Friday, America’s greatest athlete, Jim Thorpe, led the Carlisle Indians to an astounding 18-15 victory over Harvard, the returning national champion and the nation’s top-ranked team.
When the undefeated Indians took to the field against the undefeated Crimson, the celebrated running back was a doubtful starter. Injuries in previous contests had left the gridiron star with, as The Boston Globe described it, “a basket-weave of strapping adhesive plaster running almost from his toe to his knee.”
Harvard itself approached the clash of the unbeatens with casual arrogance. Mindful of Carlisle coach Pop Warner’s penchant for trick plays—and the joyous enthusiasm of his undersized Indian athletes to run them—Harvard’s imperious coach Percy Haughton had written his Carlisle counterpart a letter, warning him that any chicanery would result in cancellation of the game.
Haughton reportedly didn’t even attend the contest, boarding a train instead for New Haven to scout the Bulldogs, leaving his subordinates to oversee the second-string against what he considered overmatched foes.
Unfortunately for Haughton, Thorpe showed up at kick-off ready to play, encouraged by the fact that his lucky number 11 coincided with the 11/11/11 game date.
That the Native American athletes of a small Pennsylvania school had come this far was remarkable. A generation earlier, Massachusetts Sen. William Dawes had set out to break down Indian culture through his allotment act which substituted individual for communal ownership of land. Mission schools punished Native American students for speaking their native language and practicing their religion.
Institutions like Harvard had long turned their back on early commitments to Native American education, diverting trust funds for Native instruction to the schooling of the colonial elite.
The mixed-race Thorpe, christened “Watha Huk,” or “Bright Path” by his mother, embodied the troubled relationship between First Americans and European settlers. Descended from both the legendary Chief Black Hawk and an original English settler of New Haven, he grew up chasing rabbits on the Oklahoma plains and attending distant boarding schools.
A skilled tracker, he always called hunting and fishing his favorite sports but fame came his way via football, baseball and track—diversions of the colonizers.
Under the slate-gray sky of game day in Boston, accolades like the gold medal in the 1912 Olympic decathlon champion were yet to come. Thorpe was focused on one goal: defeating Harvard.
Despite a swollen ankle and a bandaged leg, Thorpe kicked two first-half field goals, taking Carlisle into the locker-room trailing 9-6. In the second half, Carlisle played “whirlwind football,” running sweeps and feints to keep the offense moving. Thorpe kicked another field goal to tie the game and began running more, breaking tackles on long runs.
Scoring after a nine-play drive, the Indians led 15-9. Harvard, with 12 minutes left, sent in the first string. The fresh Harvardians threatened to break through the Carlisle defense, but the Indians held them off. The only way to win, Thorpe figured, was to score another field goal and wait out the final onslaught.
“As Jim saw the day going against us, he forgot his wrenched leg and sprained ankle and called for the ball,” wrote Pop Warner. “And how that Indian did run! After the game, one of the Harvard men told me that trying to tackle the big Indian was like trying to stop a steam engine.”
After Carlisle got bogged down at the Harvard 48-yard-line, Thorpe stepped up to kick. Thorpe said his leg was “pretty sore” but found that the pain “sort of helped me because it made me more deliberate.”
“As long as I live, I will never forget that moment,” he recalled. “There I stood in the center of the field, the biggest crowd I had ever seen watching us…The ball came back square and true, and I swung my leg with all the power and force that I had, and knew, as it left my toe, that it was headed straight for the crossbar and was sure to go over.”
Thorpe’s teammates carried him off the field. Harvard scored a touchdown in the waning minutes but when the game ended, only Carlisle remained unbeaten, defeating the mighty Crimson 18-15. “This game was one of the two greatest I ever played,” Thorpe told an interviewer. The other was a victory the next year over undefeated West Point.
As for Haughton, he said of Thorpe’s performance that day: “I realized that here was the theoretical superplayer in flesh and blood.”
A lot has happened since Thorpe led the Indians to victory. Harvard has re-connected with its 17th century roots in Native American education; Olympic medals stripped from Thorpe for playing semi-pro baseball were restored; and Thorpe’s mortal remains, interred in Pennsylvania, may yet return to his family plot in Oklahoma.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, a new group of candidates vie for the positions of Undergraduate Council President and Vice President, and, every year, we endorse a ticket we think is best suited to accomplishing the myriad goals that constitutes its platform. This year, however, we withhold our endorsement.
It has become apparent in recent years that best-laid plans, great intentions, and evident hard work in our governing body cannot achieve substantial change in a way that benefits the undergraduates in a meaningful way. We have seen, time and time again, that promises made to the students are invariably not accomplished as a result of the institutionalized impotence of the student voice. This year, instead of endorsing a ticket, we thus support a drastic reorganization of the UC and a scaling back of the mission and responsibilities of the group.
As it currently stands, the two serious tickets—Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 against Crystal D. Trejo ’13 and David H. A. LeBoeuf ’13—offer nearly identical platforms to prospective voters. In what is becoming a stagnant annual refrain, each pair promises to tackle head-on the issues of social space and student-faculty interaction. Unfortunately, it is our firm belief that such promises cannot be fulfilled given the powerlessness of the UC. Most damaging of all, the UC as it currently stands gives students the appearance of having a say with the administration without any actual influence on decision-making processes.
For an example of the extreme weakness of this group, one need not look further than a few weeks ago. That current president Senan Ebrahim ’12, who has been a well respected leader on campus throughout his tenure, had to resort to asking students to spam the inboxes of administrators to get even a noncommittal response about future “Forum for Social Change” meetings is indicative of the extreme ease with which the administration has come to brush off the demands of the anemic organization.
What we envision is a UC that has been reduced to handling only what currently constitutes its Finance Committee’s responsibilities—determining grant money allocation for student organizations. It performs its function as a money allocator sufficiently well, and no plausible alternative exists to this system. That being said, virtually every other responsibility of the UC’s, which receive the majority of the work of the body, is neither effective nor irreplaceable.
Experience has taught us not to expect results from the other committees of the UC, and, in fact, each of them would be easily replaced by other organizations that would likely be able to do a more effective job.
While the UC may talk a good game about changing the nature of social space at Harvard, its leaders have made the same promises again and again over the past few years and spurred virtually no change whatsoever. In reality, students acting outside the existing bureaucratic channels are often capable of realizing their goals faster and in a much more effective way. To use a recent example on the social space front, a handful of students took power into their own hands and actually succeeded in creating Cabot Café, a much needed and readily welcomed addition to the College’s social landscape.
Furthermore, although we admire the UC’s attempts to engage the administration in a dialogue with students, such attempts seem fated to be ineffective. Students would be better served if the administrators did not have ill-attended forums like these to hide behind when avoiding engaging students in more effective and less pre-arranged formats that could produce results of real interest. Students would be better served by making their views known through extended office hours with administrators, especially Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds who is, at least nominally, the voice for the undergraduates within the administration. Furthermore, we encourage large student groups to pressure University Hall to meet with them to discuss their most important concerns.
If there is any lesson to be learned from the activist movements that have cropped up over the past year, it is that when students see a problem, they are more than capable of stepping up and fixing it outside of the UC system.
With UC elections on the horizon, it doesn’t seem to matter much who you vote for. Instead of choosing between two sets of identical candidates, take a stand against the system and sit this election out. If you must vote, consider lending your support to Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and Aneliese K. Palmer ’12, who will graduate during their presidential tenure. For the reforms we’d like to see, that’s at least a step in the right direction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Creating an AIDS-free generation has never been a policy priority for the United States government—until today,” Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton proclaimed in an address to the National Institutes of Health on Tuesday, as she called for a renewed U.S. focus on fighting the global AIDS epidemic. We, as AIDS activists, applaud Secretary Clinton for expressing this message at such a crucial juncture.
Just a year ago, members of the Harvard Global Health & AIDS Coalition, a chapter of the Student Global AIDS Campaign, together with people living with HIV/AIDS and community members[RR1] , publicly called upon President Obama to make the fight against global AIDS a U.S. priority.  As a presidential candidate, Obama promised to increase funding by $50 billion over five years for AIDS treatment and prevention programs overseas.  As modest increases during his first years in office made it evident that he was not living up to this promise, we joined together with other national AIDS activists to put pressure on the President at midterm election rallies he attended in Philadelphia, Boston, Bridgeport, and New York.
We understand the other immense pressures President Obama is under in light of the billions of dollars that must be cut in order to reduce the deficit.  However, cutting these dollars from foreign aid, which makes up a mere fraction of one percent of the U.S. budget is neither effective, nor morally conscionable.  As AIDS activists, we have been frustrated by President Obama’s stagnancy and lack of leadership on the issue. Currently, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the main mechanism through which the U.S. funds treatment for people overseas, aims only to reach four million on treatment by 2013.  This goal will likely be reached by the end of this year, with an unambitious plan in place to expand treatment targets.  As the discovery of HIV/AIDS enters its thirtieth year, the end of the virus that has eluded humanity for the past three decades is finally in sight.
Several new scientific studies show that now, more than ever, we have the tools to eradicate the disease. One groundbreaking study brings to light the fact that treatment is prevention: People who are on treatment are 96 percent less likely to transmit the disease. A new framework shows that if we invest now in the most effective prevention and treatment strategies, such as condom distribution, male circumcision, and a focus on mother-to-child transmission, in just four years, the costs of these programs will start to decrease.  These exciting new discoveries prompted the UN, in a meeting last June, to commit to putting 15 million people on treatment by 2015.  Now, AIDS activists are calling on the current administration to increase their treatment target to eight million people on treatment by 2015.
In her address, Secretary Clinton highlighted the pivotal role the United States has historically held in efforts of research, development of anti-retroviral medication, and funding for treatment and prevention programs such as PEPFAR. Moreover, she acknowledged the urgency of maintaining U.S. leadership on this issue, contending that “Our efforts have helped set the stage for the historic opportunity the world has today: to change the course of this pandemic and usher in an AIDS-free generation.”
Included in Clinton’s proposed interventions were many of those effective strategies, such as prevention of mother-to-child transmission and voluntary medical male circumcision, along with a strong emphasis on treatment with anti-retroviral therapy. The integration of these initiatives into a comprehensive plan will allow us to treat those suffering while also mitigating transmission—but its adoption will rely on the continued support and leadership of the United States. Our unique ability to take advantage of new scientific advances equips us with the capability to witness an end to AIDS. The realization of this goal depends on resurgence where faltered efforts and broken promises have compromised progress, beginning with the establishment of concrete and expanded treatment targets with timelines to follow in moving forward. In this critical moment of opportunity, we urge President Obama to capitalize on this momentum and lead concerted action.

I.
Mathilde M. N. Chaudron, an MIT student who is cross-registered to take Arabic at Harvard, was stopped at Johnston Gate before her 9 a.m. class on Thursday.
Johnston Gate was one of three entrances open for morning classes.
“At the gate, they didn’t say anything,” she said. “They [just] said, ‘I’m sorry, but it’s only Harvard students today."
Eventually, a security guard told her that if she knew a Harvard student, she could get in. Chaudron called Andrew H. Bellisari, a Ph.D. candidate in history, who walked over to Johnston gate to vouch for her.
But when Bellisari tried to wave his ID and guide her through, an un-uniformed man guided them to the side.
“He actually didn’t introduce himself to us, so I don’t really know who he was,” Bellisari said. “He wanted to know where we were trying to get to. He didn’t ask to see her ID, he was listening to me as the Harvard student.”
The man, HUPD Sergeant Denis Downing, eventually let Chaudron pass.
“He was like, ‘Thank you, I hope you understand.’ And we just walked away,” said Bellisari. “It’s a good thing she was white and well-dressed and wearing glasses.”
After the incident,, Chaudron was still confused about the purpose of Occupy Harvard.
“I don’t know about Harvard, but at MIT, [even] if you don’t have money, you can get in,” she said.
II.
Like Chaudron, extension school student Robert M. R. Cunningham did not expect the roadblocks he found on his way to the yard Thursday morning.
“Have they visited Mankiw yet? Because I want to see what his face looks like when he sees this,” he said.
“I didn’t get any e-mails about this, [even though]  I’m on the Activist list and the Dems list,” he explained. “I had no idea this was happening until I read it in the Crimson this morning.”
Cunningham said that because he hadn’t heard about the event before it happened, he doesn’t think that the protesters are Harvard-affiliated.
“Last time students protested, we got Canaday. I don’t want to see what will happen to the buildings,” he added.
Although sympathetic to the Occupy movement, Cunningham had no plans to join protesters in the yard.
“Being that I’m part of the one percent, [I support it] and I think I should have to pay higher taxes,” he said. “But I think it’s hypocritical if I show up because I am the one percent.”
III.
Inside tent city, the mood was triumphant and studious.
Occupiers stationed themselves outside of their tents, textbooks in hand, chatting with reporters and curious passers-by as they studied.
About 20 tents were set up in front of University Hall. Ten were purchased with money donated by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to the Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM). According to organizers, the tents cost about $40 apiece.
“There’s obviously vast inequality within the country,” said Amanda Haziz–Ginsberg MTS ’12, a member of the Harvard International Socialist Organization and one of the organizers of Occupy Harvard. “We are no longer satisfied with the role that Harvard plays in perpetuating [it].”
“Generally, what we’re talking about is that in a lot of ways Harvard acts as a corporation, not a university,” Haziz–Ginsberg added, balancing her Arabic textbook on her knee.
At that point, Shauna L. Shames, a graduate student and a former Crimson editor, stopped by to give a donation.
“This is great, I was at the thing last night,” she said, handing Haziz-Ginsberg folded bills.
Shames said she couldn’t camp out because she’s working on her dissertation, but asked whether Occupy Harvard had an online donation link. As Shames walked away, Haziz-Ginsberg assured her they were setting one up.
For Haziz–Ginsberg, Harvard’s issues also stem from prominent faculty members such as N. Gregory Mankiw. Last week, students walked out of his introductory economics course.
“The day that we were there, he was teaching a course on income inequality and it was clear from the get-go that he was very skeptical of taxing the rich,” she said.
Harvard’s efforts to reach out to the 99 percent, Haziz–Ginsberg said, are not where they should be.
“We support a shift towards a more progressive financial aid policy at the College,” she said, but pointed out that graduate students don’t have that same level of aid. Haziz–Ginsberg conjectured that this is because Harvard graduates are expected to go on to be in the one percent.
“I think that’s a fallacy,” she added.
As of Thursday morning—a list of demands was released at the General Assembly on Friday evening—not all students are on the same page.
A Harvard sophomore who declined to give his name because of his involvement on an athletic team is among the Occupiers.
“Personally, my biggest issue is the disparity in health care,” he said, leaning against a tree and clutching his introductory Spanish textbook. His father is battling cancer.
“I’ve seen a system that at least has a social safety net,” he said. He lived in the United Kingdom for part of his life.
The sophomore said that, for him, participating in Occupy Harvard is largely a matter of standing in solidarity with the Occupy movement overall.
“We have a lot of good things to say about Harvard, but also realize it’s not perfect,” he s  aid. “If we’re being asked to move, we’re in the right place.”
Meanwhile, Occupy Harvard has no plans to go home.
“I think [how long we’re here] is going to depend on the Administration’s response and what they’re willing to concede,” said Haziz–Ginsberg. “Harvard should know that we’re not going anywhere anytime soon.”
In a letter sent out to the Harvard Community Thursday afternoon, Provost Alan Garber and Executive Vice President Katie Lapp said that while they respect the right of community members to speak out as they wish, the lockdown will continue as long as tent city remains.
“Securing access to the Yard is necessary for the safety of the freshmen and others who live and work in the Yard, for the students who will be sleeping outdoors as part of the protest, and for the overall campus,” they wrote.
IV.
Outside the Yard, others were still having trouble getting where they needed to go.
Laura Von Daniels, a postdoctoral fellow in government, had just arrived from Germany with her husband, Justus. They live in Somerville, and had come to Widener to pick up his spouse’s ID.
They were stopped at the Widener Gate and turned away without an explanation for the lockdown.
“No guests, they said,” Justus said.
“Technically, he is a Harvard Spouse ID holder, he just needs to get inside,” said Laura.
“I’m not one now, but I could be in 15 minutes,” added Justus.
Laura and Justus said the denial was not a major issue, but now Justus cannot access Harvard libraries and other facilities.
“Don’t say that you’re sorry if you’re not,” Laura told the security guards as they walked away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lucas Papademos, a soft-spoken professor of public policy, was scheduled to teach a graduate class on the global financial crisis next spring.
Instead, the Kennedy School scholar, who was named a visiting professor in April, has been suddenly thrust into a starring role in the emergency efforts to prevent a collapse of the European financial system, after he was tapped Friday as interim prime minister of his native Greece.
Papademos will lead a new Greek unity government formed after the fall of former prime minister George A. Papandreou, whose governing coalition disintegrated last week after his plans to submit a controversial $177 billion loan package to a referendum backfired. The move angered European leaders, who had negotiated the package as part of a Europe-wide effort to stabilize the euro. The plan also alienated some of Papandreou’s supporters, who feared the plan would be rejected.
Papademos, who was an unofficial adviser to Papandreou during the loan negotiations, faces a formidable task in the months ahead. His main task will be to implement the aid package, which includes a controversial provision for private sector banks to write off 50 percent of the face value of their Greek bond holdings. He will also have to deal with the passage of a new budget which will likely contain new austerity measures. Similar efforts have triggered a series of massive protests in Greece.
“The objective realities pose long odds on success,” said Graham Allison, a government professor at the Kennedy School. “So Lucas’ friends and colleagues can only applaud his courage in responding to this call and pray for miracles.”
Papademos, who enjoys a high approval rating in Greek opinion polls, is only expected to remain in office long enough to push through the reforms, according to news reports, although he could run in elections expected in the spring.
“[Papademos] is there to do one type of surgery, to get the financial packages from the Europeans negotiated on the best terms Greece can manage. But it’s not clear that they have the political muscle to force Parliament to meet all those standards,” said Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School.
With elections taking place in Greece early next year, the selection of Papandreou’s successor became an intense political drama, with the opposition reluctant to support a leader who could prove to be a challenger.
However, Papademos is widely respected in Greece and in Europe. In 2010, he completed an eight-year term as vice president of the European Central Bank, the EU’s central bank. Prior to that, Papademos served as the governor of the Greek central bank from 1994 to 2002.
“That’s the anchor of his reputation,” said Parker. “He led Greece’s transition from the drachma to the euro, so he’s admired by the Eurocrats and in his own country by Greek businesspeople who felt going into the euro was a good thing at the time.”
At Harvard, colleagues aren’t holding their breath for Papademos’ return.
“He lectures on the Global Financial Crisis, but I think it would be fair to say he won’t be back for January term,” Parker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was all because of a lost game of Kings. At least that’s how Vice Presidential Candidate Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 explains how she and running mate Ryan P. Halprin ’12 became the last-minute addition to the Undergraduate Council ballot.
“We were playing Kings Cup, and one of the cards was ‘the last two people to put their hands in the air have to run for UC.’ So Ryan and I were the lucky winners,” deadpans Palmer.
Despite some initial hesitation to run, Palmer says, “we have always had secret ambitions to become president of America—but we only want to be president if we can be president together.”
Of course, neither presidency nor co-presidency are likely in the cards for Halprin and Palmer, the latest in a long line of “joke” tickets for the UC presidency, particularly as the two seniors would be graduating halfway through their terms.
True to the “joke” candidate tradition, though, the presidential aspirants insist their campaign is no laughing matter.
In fact, if they’re elected, the two say they’ve already devised a solution to the graduation problem: When they leave Harvard, they’ll just dissolve the UC.
“If we’re elected, the UC can go on sabbatical when we take over, and then in the fall semester, everyone gets a break, because there will be no UC,” she says.
‘NO RULEZ,’ JUST FUN
In the café of the Science Center, it was almost as if both candidates had shown up to the interview. Interviewing Palmer with Halprin piping in via G-chat, the two candidates completed each other’s sentences, even though Halprin was across campus in lecture at the time.
Palmer says that she attributes this unique skill set to her deep connection with Halprin. “We can speak without using words,” she says. “We’re telekinetic, and that’s a really special element of our ticket that neither of the other tickets can bring.”
Palmer says she would be willing to challenge her opponents on this front. “If they think they are telekinetic, we challenge them to a battle,” she says.
Given this competitive edge and their busy schedules, Halprin and Palmer say that they do not plan to go to great lengths to win votes. However, “people are free to endorse us,” Palmer says.
Palmer says they hope to spend their $400 campaign allotment on a party recreating Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebration in October.
“We will have HUDS instead of a cake, and it will be mostly Ranger cookies, since that’s usually a Wednesday dessert,” she says. “And instead of Yo-Yo Ma, my roommate, Molly, will play the harp.”
Palmer also says she would like for the open bar to serve only Rubinoff and Franzia. “I have it on good authority that [University President] Drew Faust will slap the bag,” she claims.
Halprin-Palmer supporter Noah A. Hoch ’11 says that he is excited to attend the 375th party.
“It’ll be so good, you’ll be asking yourself, ‘375? More like 750 because this is twice as good as I thought it could be!,’” Hoch writes in an email.
Any remaining campaign money will be used to buy “pounds and pounds of mud,” according to Palmer.
Palmer says that their allocation of campaign funds attests to their skill at budgeting UC and Harvard money.
“Don’t cut jobs, or hot breakfast, just cut corners and leave it to us,” she says.
The Halprin-Palmer campaign platform is centered around their motto, “Senior Spring No Rulez Forever.”
Palmer referred to ancient mythology to explain how ‘spring’ symbolizes new birth to both Harvard and the UC “in this new era of democracy.”
The term ‘No Rulez,’ is meant as a critique of the UC’s constitution, and refers back to the pair’s belief that college affairs should be run in a hands-off manner, Palmer says.
Palmer says that while ‘forever’ is an ambitious timeline, “it is not how long we will be in charge of the UC, because we won’t be here, and neither will the UC.”
NEVER TOO LATE
Halprin and Palmer announced their candidacy on Nov. 2, two days after the official declaration deadline.
“It was like asking for an extension on a paper,” Palmer says. “We emailed our head TF—in this case the election committee—and told them our grandmother had died and that we wanted our paper, the campaign, to be the best it could be, and that we just needed one day.”
Due to their last minute entry into the Presidential race, Halprin and Palmer were penalized a day of campaigning. “Did the lost day hurt us? Probably,” Palmer says. “No, scratch that, nothing can hurt us.”
Halprin says he believes the delay may have helped their campaign. “The delay made people wait on the edge of their seats,” he says, as Palmer interjects, “It might have been planned, but we won’t disclose that information.”
The two met on the set of “On Harvard Time” in their freshman year, and, according to Halprin, “all relationships that start on the set of a film last forever and everyone knows that.”
Palmer credits her long relationship with Halprin as a source of strength in their campaign. “We’ve known each other since our freshman year, which is longer than any of the other candidates, since they haven’t been here for four years.”
Collin A. Jones ’12 and Pete D. Davis ’12, the humorous outsider ticket that gave Ebrahim-Cao a run for their money in the last UC election, have agreed to be campaign managers for Halprin and Palmer.
“The fact that they can do this their senior year, in the midst of the recruiting season and thesis-writing is really a testament to their commitment to the student body,” says Jones. “Although it would be impossible for any outsider to be as entertaining as the Jones-Davis ticket of 2010, the student body recognizes true talent and devotion.”
Hoch says he pledges his support to the Halprin-Palmer ticket because Halprin is a “man of hearty constitution, integrity, and efficiency,” he says.
Regardless of the results of the campaign, Palmer says she is confident of some votes. “My roommates are voting for me, so take that, Danny and Crystal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council presidential campaign of Crystal D. Trejo ’13 and running mate David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13 came together much like many students’ problem sets—at 3 a.m. the morning their paperwork was due.
But rather than signifying the typical student’s procrastination, the candidates say that their down-to-the-wire decision came from a feeling that they had something new and essential to offer the race.
“We realized we had to run to basically get these issues out there to be able to make change,” says LeBoeuf, an inactive Crimson news writer.
With a slogan of “Real Action,” Trejo and LeBoeuf have built their campaign on promises to advocate for better use of social space, increase the accountability and accessibility of the UC and the University administration, and create innovative strategies for student group funding and advertising.
While Trejo and LeBoeuf’s campaign platform echoes many of the same concerns raised by their competition, friends say that the pair’s ability to listen to many perspectives and translate them into action, as well as their experience working with the administration, will set them apart.
THE INSIDER
Coming to the presidential race from different backgrounds, Trejo and LeBoeuf say that their ability to look at problems from different angles will be one of their biggest assets.
Trejo has been on the UC since her freshman year, focusing her efforts on the Council’s push for social space.
Having served as her high school’s student body president and president of the Arizona Association of Student Councils, Trejo says she was drawn to the UC after arriving at Harvard because of her previous experience with student government and her desires to get to know the Harvard community.
Although she served as one of the Quincy House representatives last year, Trejo lost her election after transferring to Winthrop this fall. She has stayed active in the Council and currently serves as the chair of the UC’s Social Programming Task Force, a committee that she helped found.
In addition to the UC, Trejo, a Government concentrator, is involved in groups across campus including the Crimson Key Society, the Institute of Politics liaison program, and Candela Salsa, a Latin dance group. Though she says she plans to cut back on some of her commitments if elected, Trejo has been able to use her other experiences in the presidential race, taking breaks from campaigning outside the Science Center for quick salsa dances with LeBoeuf.
“David’s always been game,” she says with a laugh.
THE ACTIVIST
In contrast to Trejo’s years of UC experience, LeBoeuf joined the UC last spring after transferring from Clark University, where he began his involvement with both student and local government. LeBoeuf, a Social Studies concentrator with a secondary in Spanish, says that his transfer status offers him a new perspective on Harvard life.
“Anyone who says it’s a detraction, I think they really don’t understand the transfer experience and really don’t understand the Harvard experience either,” LeBoeuf says.
LeBoeuf served as treasurer for the student council at Clark University and works for the Initiative for Engaged Citizenship, an organization that works in his hometown of Worcester, Mass. to increase voter participation among recently naturalized refugees.
LeBoeuf says that his outside experience will be an asset in letting him consider methods that may seem atypical for Harvard student leaders.
“He likes to listen to a broad range of viewpoints and take all the facts into consideration before he makes a decision,” says LeBeouf’s roommate Brandon H. Jones ’13.
For Trejo and LeBoeuf, this combination of diverse experiences helps differentiate them from their competitors.
“It brings a good balance that will appeal to a lot of Harvard students,” LeBoeuf says.
SHORT TERM ACTION,
LONG TERM VISION
Though Trejo and LeBoeuf come to the Council with a wide range of experiences, the two share similar visions for the UC’s future.
Trejo and LeBoeuf first worked together last spring on the Social Programming Task Force, and many of their ideas stem from these conversations. The candidates say that their more realistic approach to these issues, with simple, concrete ideas, will appeal to voters.
In addressing the perennial concerns over social space at Harvard, Trejo and LeBoeuf have focused on creating both short-term solutions and longer-term goals.
The two propose opening under-utilized buildings and extending hours of popular spaces such as Ticknor Lounge for student group meetings and social events.
Trejo already has experience working for increased access to available spaces, including planning last year’s school-wide “Lights Out” dance in Annenberg.
“Nothing has been more gratifying to me on the UC than being at those events and seeing tons of Harvard students interacting from all different parts of campus,” she says. “It was great to know that the longest line that weekend wasn’t going to be outside the Owl.”
Trejo and LeBeouf have also named social space as a long-term priority and have proposed changes to the Science Center to open it for student group use.
The ticket has also focused much of their campaign on increasing accountability. They plan to host their first 13 weekly UC meetings in the houses and Annenberg to encourage student participation and input.
To further increase accountability of the UC, the candidates would start an online suggestion box and a tracking system to allow students to see the status of the Council’s initiatives.
“If we’re not publicly being evaluated, we can’t improve,” LeBoeuf says.
Members of the Trejo-LeBoeuf campaign staff have said that the ticket’s combination of feasible short-term measures and long-term vision makes their campaign the most promising.
“Crystal and David really have a vision of what they want Harvard to look like in 5 or 10 years,” says UC Parliamentarian Darragh Nolan ’15, head of freshman outreach for the campaign. “They’re not looking for popularity, they’re looking to change how Harvard actually works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard community continues to deal with heightened security measures surrounding the Yard—including checkpoints and restricted access to freshman dorms—Occupy Harvard protesters are fighting the sentiment that occupiers are to blame for the increased security, asserting that the administration is leveraging the security measures to cast the demonstration in a negative light.
Protesters and non-participants sympathetic to the movement argue that the security measures are an overreaction and send an antithetical message to the occupation’s goals of creating an inclusive space for public dialogue at Harvard.
“In the past, Harvard has not acted this way towards much larger security risks ... Last year there was an armed robbery in front of Thayer and the Yard wasn’t shut down then,” said Taras B. Dreszer ’14, who has been active in Occupy Harvard since the tent city was first built last week.
“We don’t feel like we did anything to warrant that security, and we shouldn’t be blamed for it. It’s 100 percent the Administration’s fault,” Dreszer said. “In my opinion they’re doing it out of fear that their image will be compromised. And they’re doing it to turn student opinion against us, which has had a certain degree of success.”
Last Thursday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katie Lapp issued a statement explaining their decision to restrict access to the Yard, a move they said was motivated by security concerns and not an attempt to stifle speech.
“First, we respect and protect the rights of members of the Harvard community to express their views on matters of public debate,” the statement read. “These rights, of course, are tempered by the rights of other members of our community to express their views, and for all of us to live, study, and work in an educationally appropriate environment.”
“The events of last night raised safety concerns: the number of demonstrators was large, many of the demonstrators were not from Harvard, and specific behaviors were troubling.  For this reason, the University took what we consider to be appropriate security precautions as the situation evolved during the evening,” Garber and Lapp added, referring to the events of Wednesday night when protesters first entered the Yard.
Over the weekend, Occupy Harvard released a statement through their website condemning the heightened security in the Yard.
“The ongoing ID checks and partial gate closures are as unnecessary as they are inconvenient,” the statement read. “Furthermore, the decision to only grant entry to Harvard ID holders has reinforced the institutional exclusivity and elitism that Occupy Harvard seeks to change.”
Faculty members have also raised concerns about the new security measures, ranging from logistical issues to questions of the symbolic implications of keeping the Yard locked down to non-Harvard affiliates.
Over the weekend, Law School Professor Duncan Kennedy ’64 penned a criticism of the security protocols in a letter to President Faust that was subsequently released to the media.
“I understand that it might have been the view of some that it was important to protect the symbolic center the University against an equally symbolic contamination by ‘outsiders,’ or that there were other questions of ‘image’ involved,” the letter read. “But ... as a participant, the massive security presence, albeit friendly enough, had a Homeland Security feel to it.”
History Associate Professor Alison F. Frank shares similar concerns and has decided to hold class off-campus at Café Algiers in Harvard Square this coming week.
“It’s not an expression of my passionate support for the Occupy Harvard movement. It’s an expression of my support of a campus that is open to the community,” Frank said. “You can’t have a dialogue if you’re afraid of people who are not formal members of the Harvard community.”
Frank asserts that limiting access to Harvard Yard to only those who have Harvard IDs sends the wrong message people who are not officially affiliated with the University.
Dreszer and other protesters are also expressing frustration with what they perceive to be the administration’s lack of willingness to engage protesters in conversation.
According to members of Occupy Harvard, the protest has made attempts to invite members of the administration to participate in general assemblies and to begin a dialogue about the occupation moving forward.
During a general assembly on the first night of the camp, Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson attempted to convince protesters to move to Tercentenary Theatre, where they would be less disruptive to freshman dorms.
Occupiers refused to move but invited Nelson to join the group for a general assembly the next day. Due to a miscommunication, Nelson did not make an appearance, leaving occupiers confused and discouraged.
A spokesperson for Faust and Garber declined to comment as to whether the president or provost had personally engaged with any of the occupiers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The New England Marxism Conference convened at the Science Center this weekend, drawing 180 attendees with workshops such as “Marxism and Oppression” and a closing plenary session that broke out into raucous chants including “Free Palestine! Long live the Intifada!”
The meeting was hosted by the International Socialist Organization (ISO), a group founded in 1977 and supported by member donations, according to organizer Amanda Haziz-Ginsberg, a Divinity School student and participant in Occupy Harvard.
Many attendees at the event said they participated in Occupy protests, including those at Harvard, Burlington, Vt. and Wall Street.
Haziz-Ginsberg said the Harvard ISO was created last spring and is currently applying for club status at the University.
ISO activist and writer Ashley Smith delivered the opening plenary speech, “Why Marx Was Right.” Other conference workshops covered class struggle, racism, and the labor movement.
During the day’s closing plenary, “Is revolution possible in the US,” the crowd erupted into chants: “Obama’s not a socialist, we are!” and “Fuck the church, fuck the state, women must decide our fate!”
The ISO aligns itself with the ideologies of Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and Luxemburg, and does not support the major “corporate-dominated” US political parties.
ISO activist Sherry Wolf spoke about the “99 percent” living under “the ruling class.”
“We are the ones that did everything we were told to do,” she said. “You study hard, you get a degree, you work hard, you play by the rules. And we got screwed.”
Attendees also criticized the American labor movement, saying that individual workers could not be heard in American unions. Others decried the practice of appealing solely to economic interests as a basis for organizing.
One common thread of discussion was a perceived victimization of activists in the “garbage produced by the media.”
“The Protesters were attacked,” Tristin Aidie said. “But the press was able to turn it around with a couple quick words.”
Aidie cited the Minnesota Teamster Strike of 1984 as an example of how socialism may achieve success. Strike organizers depicted corporations as evil in the struggle for wage increases, shorter working hours, and union rights.
The strike of Verizon workers along the East coast, the Oakland general strike, and the Occupy Movement were all mentioned as opportunities for similar organizing strategies.
The Crimson asked Haziz-Ginsberg and Clark University Graduate student Khury Peterson-Smith whether the vocal support for the Intifada at the plenary session expressed support for violence.
“I am against violence but I believe in resistance,” Ginsberg said.
Citing the writings of Malcolm X, Peterson-Smith said, “I believe in resistance by any means necessary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jenny Ye ’13 and Julia B. Konrad ’13 were elected president and vice president of the Institute of Politics, respectively, Sunday evening in the first contested race since 2008. Their ticket emphasized integrating public service with existing programs and building a community within the IOP.
“I’m really excited about building civic interest and passion at Harvard, may that be among students who are already involved in the IOP or among my peers who are CS concentrators,” Ye said.
Ye and Konrad ran against Sophie B. Fry ’13 and Jordan E. Sessler ’13. Both tickets emphasized cohesion among the IOP’s 13 programs, publicizing the IOP’s resources on campus, and public service.
To build camaraderie across programs, Ye and Konrad have proposed a mentorship program that would connect members of the IOP community who share common interests—be the pairs alumni-student or even student-student.
But many members believe that the main challenge facing the IOP is that the campus at large does not understand what resources, connections, and opportunities the IOP provides students.
“When people think about politics on campus, the IOP should be at the top of their mental map,” said outgoing IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12. “We could do more to advocate for that on campus.”
Sessler expressed similar sentiments, saying that the IOP functions well for a core group of 30 or so members but not for the broader membership base of 300 students or for the 6,000 students in the College. Ye and Konrad say they will work to ameliorate this through active outreach to student groups.
Both Ye and Konrad have strong backgrounds in service at the IOP. Konrad served as the chair for the Citizenship Tutoring Program while Ye has participated in multiple IOP programs that facilitate teaching and tutoring.
Medha B. Gargeya ’14 said that while both tickets were qualified and highlighted the importance of service, one ticket stood out, though she declined to state which ticket received her vote.
“Some people hide behind broad words like community and service,” Gargeya said. “I looked for the ticket that delineated ideas the clearest.”
IOP member Benjamin S. Raderstorf ’14 said that the pair’s experience falls in line with the IOP’s mission.
“If the IOP isn’t including some form of service in everything that it does, then it’s not fully accomplishing what it should be,” Raderstorf said.
Ye said she envisions cross-program service initiatives, such as bringing writers from the Harvard Political Review together with teachers from the Civics Program to hold journalism workshops.
Solnet said that fusing service and politics should be a priority.
“All the programs in the IOP should have some component that teaches students about direct service and the nuts and bolts of politics generally,” Solnet said.

CORRECTION: NOV. 16, 2011
The Nov. 14 article "IOP Elects New Leaders" incorrectly stated that Julia B. Konrad '13 was the chair of the Institute of Politics Civics Tutoring Program. She was, in fact, chair of its Citizenship Tutoring Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Daniel P. Bicknell ’13 stands next to his vice-presidential running mate Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, the first thing that comes to mind is their vast height difference.
Behind their campaign banner, 6-foot-3-inch Bicknell holds one end of the sign at arm’s length while 5-foot-1-inch Yalamanchi peers over the sign at the other end.
But with ten semesters of combined UC experience, established connections with administrators across campus, and a vision to build communities at Harvard, this unlikely pair compensates for their height gap by seeing eye-to-eye when it comes to improving student life.
Bicknell and Yalamanchi say they have a “realistic” platform, pushing for extended use of current social spaces and funding for student-initiated activities.
Their friends say that “D and P” are more than just good leaders—they genuinely care about their classmates and aspire to bring change that is attainable in the next year.
‘DP for UC’
In front of the Science Center, Bicknell and Yalamanchi have only seven minutes at the top of each hour to make their ticket known to passersby.
Bicknell shouts “Vote DP for UC” in his booming voice as Yalamanchi approaches students with a huge smile to hand out flyers.
Their slogan, “Proven leaders delivering results,” refers to the candidates’ work on UC committees since they were freshmen.
Back then, their promises were merely youthful ventures, such as bringing hand sanitizing stations to dorms during the swine flu peak and extending brain break hours.
Now, with those accomplishments in hand, the two seek to effect change on a larger but still reasonable scale.
The ticket’s mission to build communities at Harvard is bolstered by a focus on continuing the Forum for Change initiated by the outgoing president and vice-president Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12. Bicknell and Yalamanchi also push for improving the social experience for freshmen by finding ways to improve their access to current social spaces.
“We know that a campus center and open student-administration exchanges are goals to work towards, [but] not things we can promise,” says Yalamanchi, emphasizing their practical platform. “While we’re definitely striving towards those greater goals, we’re first picking at the low-hanging fruit.”
‘BICDREAMY’
Originally from Boca Raton, Fla., Bicknell is the eldest of three and has always been passionate about sustainable initiatives and educating people about the environment. Friends say that his dedication to the UC extends to attending UC-sponsored hockey games on Friday nights and choosing impromptu UC meetings over pre-planned dinner dates.
“Whenever I walk somewhere with Danny, it takes twice as long as it normally would because of how many friends he runs into,” says Hannah M. Cardiel ’13, who works with Bicknell on Mather’s House Committee board and EnviroEd, a volunteer organization that teaches public school students about environmental issues. “You can’t know Danny and not be friends with him.”
Bicknell’s “baby,” as Yalamanchi calls it, is the Student Initiatives Program, which funds mid- to large-sized social events spearheaded by students and held in common spaces.
Students who participated in the first SIP event at Mather last spring say that the program affirmed Bicknell’s ability to carry out his agenda to improve access to student funding and build community.
“He’s always willing to listen and gets excited about great ideas from the people he’s working with,” says Cardiel. “He makes everyone on the team feel valued.”
“Girls call him ‘BicDreamy,’” says Bicknell’s roommate Kartikeya Mital ’13. “I think that sums it up.”
‘BIG P’
Yalamanchi is known to her blockmates as “Big P” for her ability to juggle multiple projects at the same time. A Detroit native, Yalamanchi is often seen wearing a big smile and can bench more than half her body weight.
“P might only be 5-foot-1, but when she speaks about student issues, she has a commanding presence that elicits respect,” says her close friend Alana Pradhan ’13, who also created the campaign website.
Yalamanchi, who is on her fifth semester with UC’s Finance Committee, climbed the ranks from her position as Crimson Yard representative freshman year. She is currently in her second semester as the organization’s treasurer and controls a budget of over half a million dollars.
“I’m someone who finds the mere mention of money boring,” writes Andrew Berry, lecturer on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and Yalamanchi’s freshman advisor, in an email. “But I was impressed by Pratyusha’s ability to peer through the fiscal thickets to see the underlying issues.”
Outside of the UC, Yalamanchi is also a pre-med student, an editor for the Harvard Global Health Review, a researcher in a cardiology lab, and a member of a Harvard Alumni Association.
“She has the competence of ten Harvard students combined,” says DanThuy Chu ’13, Yalamanchi’s roommate.
‘BICKMANCHITAS’
Current UC members say that Bicknell’s strengths in advocacy and Yalamanchi’s finance background makes the duo a formidable partnership.
“We came from really similar backgrounds, fighting for really similar things,” says Bicknell. “We worked in very different portions of campus, but were united by our common philosophy and vision.”
“I could really just see myself working with Danny next year,” adds Yalamanchi. “We just have so much fun together and I really like the idea of building a UC community with that.”
Yalamanchi, who calls herself “the shorter half,” often signs emails to their campaign staff with the nickname “Bickmanchitas.”
Campaign staff meetings are similarly full of color and energy. At times, Bicknell is seen wearing headgear of various sorts at these meetings, such as a lion hat with long paws that can be wrapped around his neck like a scarf.
“He’s kept my spirits up throughout the campaign,” Yalamanchi says. “Whenever I’m feeling concerned, he’ll always just say, ‘Pratyusha, we got this.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years after Harvard began a mentoring program to rebuild bridges with the Allston community, the University is nearing completion of an expansion that will offer the neighborhood new services from batting cages to a mini-golf course to a small library.
The University started work on a 9,000 square foot annex to the Harvard Education Portal this summer, and doors are now slated to open early next year, according to officials.
The annex, located on 175 North Harvard Street, will expand the Ed Portal’s hours and cater to community members beyond the mostly middle school-age students who use the existing facility for mentoring and tutoring from Harvard undergraduates in math, science, writing, and public speaking.
The program has been hailed as a success by both Harvard administrators and Allston residents, who have had a tense relationship with the University over Harvard’s stalled development plans.
“Anything they do to expand [the program] is just adding to a great idea,” said Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association and a sometime critic of the University.
Harvard officials said the expansion was aimed at expanding beyond academic offerings to include more recreational opportunities for a broader range of age groups.
“We’ve reached a point at the [Ed] Portal where clearly there’s such additional potential for other things that we can do,” said the Ed Portal’s faculty director and founder, Robert A. Lue.
Until recently, the annex was an underutilized warehouse space. But over the summer, the University built a storage closet and side classroom in the space and spruced up the building’s gray walls with tangerine, periwinkle, and lime green paint. The annex will be finished in late January or early February, officials said.
“We tried to make [the space] as flexible as possible”, said Director of Community Planning Maile Takahashi.
While the portal is typically open four days a week from Monday to Thursday, the annex will allow activities to be extended throughout the weekend.
The new annex represents a continuation of Harvard’s community outreach following the halt of construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints, a move that angered neighbors. At the time, the University sought to placate residents with a series of community development projects, including a popular temporary mini-golf course, which will be resurrected in the annex as a way to teach members about physics, geometry, and “hand-eye coordination,” Lue said.
Lue said he views the project as a “sandbox”—an experimental space “where we can play with and develop a new paradigm.”
Ranvir S. Dhillon ’13, who has been mentoring at the portal six hours a week for the past three semesters, said he is excited about the new space.
“We’ll be able to do a lot more with mentees than we can now in just a classroom,” said Dhillon, who hosts the Ed Portal’s Science Club each week. “Students can get a lot more out of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A last-minute charge by the Harvard women’s basketball team fell just short Sunday afternoon, when co-captain Brogan Berry and sophomore guard Christine Clark brought their team back to within one point after trailing, 69-60. But the Crimson (0-2) was unable to convert on its final possession and fell, 69-68, to Butler (1-1) at the KCRG-TV 9 Hawkeye Challenge in Iowa City, Iowa.
It was the second of two games this weekend for the Harvard women, who fell to a highly touted University of Iowa team after holding a commanding first-half lead in the opening round of the tournament on Saturday night.
“It was a disappointing weekend for us overall,” Berry said, “but hopefully it will serve as a catalyst to raise the bar higher for ourselves the rest of the season.”
BUTLER 69, HARVARD 68
Harvard may have been feeling the aftereffects of its game the previous night, for the team was slow to get going in the first half.
“I thought we started the game really poorly,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
The two sides traded baskets for much of the half before the Bulldogs—led by freshman forward Haley Howard’s 13 first half points—pulled ahead, 34-26.
Co-captain Lindsay Louie stemmed the run with a bucket, and Berry, who led the Crimson with 11 first-half points and 18 on the day, added a three-pointer to bring Harvard within three.
But Butler continued to pull away before Berry hit another three at the buzzer to send the Crimson into the locker room down, 42-36.
“Poor defense, poor shooting, no offensive connection,” said Smith of the team’s first-half performance.
Harvard scored the first six points of the second half to tie the score at 42, but the Bulldogs responded swiftly with a 12-0 run.
The Crimson clawed their way back and a put-back from sophomore center Elise Gordon brought Harvard within one, 55-54, with just under 10 minutes to play.
After trading a few buckets, Butler poured in nine straight points to take a 69-60 lead with 1:34 to play.
Clark took over for the Crimson at that point, scoring five of her 15 second half points to bring Harvard within four. Berry drained a three with 25 seconds left, cutting the deficit to one.
The Bulldogs missed the front end of a one-and-one with 12 seconds remaining, and Harvard pulled down the rebound. The stage was set for a comeback victory, but the Crimson was unable to get off a last-second shot, and Butler walked off with the win.
“It was a game that should have been ours,” Berry said.
IOWA 90, HARVARD 81
A career high 28-point performance from sophomore guard Christine Clark wasn’t enough to carry Harvard to a season-opening victory on Saturday night.
After a dominant first-half performance in which the Crimson led by as many as 14, a second-half charge by Iowa (1-1) put Harvard in an insurmountable hole, and it fell to the Hawkeyes, 90-81, in the opening round of the Hawkeye Challenge.
The Hawkeyes returned four starters from a squad that made its fourth consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament last spring. Add to that the 11th-ranked recruiting class in the country, and Iowa was clearly a formidable opponent to begin the Crimson’s year.
The Ivy League representatives gained an early 9-5 advantage, thanks to a three-pointer from junior forward Miriam Rutzen and a pair of buckets from Clark. The Hawkeyes knotted the score at nine before Harvard exploded on a 19-5 run.
A second three from Rutzen, a traditional three-point play from Clark, and buckets from sophomore guard/forward Missy Mullins and Berry helped catapult the Crimson to a 28-14 advantage 10 minutes into the first half.
The Hawkeyes cut the lead to eight before Clark connected on a three to put Harvard up, 33-22. Iowa chipped away from that point forward; they trailed, 40-37, at the break after scoring the last six points of the half.
Iowa capitalized on a few Harvard turnovers right out of the break. The two sides traded baskets for much of the half, and the score was tied at 55 with just over 11 minutes to play.
But the Hawkeyes were stronger down the stretch. Led by junior guard Jaime Printy, who put in 24 points, Iowa opened up a 10-point lead.
Clark stopped the bleeding with back-to-back buckets, and the Crimson was down, 75-68, with 4:30 to play. But the Hawkeyes held strong, and Harvard couldn’t muster a comeback.
“I was pretty happy with everything we did. We just didn’t end up with the win,” Delanie-Smith said.
It was a career day for Mullins, who dropped 12 points. Clark also tied her career-high, pouring in 28 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) started off its season with a bang, dominating both Cornell (0-2, 0-2 Ivy) and Dartmouth (1-1, 1-1 Ivy) in its annual tri-squad meet on Saturday at Blodgett Pool. The Crimson sailed past its opponents, defeating the Big Green, 180.5-119.5, and the Big Red, 227.5-72.5.
“I think that we started off the season pretty well and we really showed our strength in terms of the freshman squad and everybody else on the team,” co-captain Matthew McLean said. “I think we are starting off the season pretty strong and kind of like a powerhouse.”
Harvard demonstrated its dominance by placing first in 11 out of the 16 events. The pair of wins brought the Crimson’s Ivy League dual meet win streak to 11, as the squad went a perfect 9-0 last season.
“The team did great,” freshman Mike Mosca said. “The camaraderie was incredible. This was the first time ... I really got to experience how awesome my team is. It is really inspiring.”
The first-place finishes began with the first event, the 200-yard medley relay. Harvard was represented by sophomore Jack Pretto, freshman Chuck Katis, sophomore Oliver Lee, and freshman Griffin Schumacher.
The relay team finished over 1.5 seconds ahead of the second-place representatives Dartmouth for a solid start to the meet.
In the 1000-yard freestyle, freshman Mike Gaudiani took a close second to the Big Green’s Nejc Zupan by a mere 0.5 seconds, turning in a time of 9:25.82.
Senior Niall Janney also earned the Crimson second-place points in the 200 butterfly, finishing between Dartmouth and Cornell in a touch-out race.
Freshman Zach Walters and sophomore Spenser Goodman snagged a 1-2 finish in the 200-yard freestyle, increasing Harvard’s growing advantage over their opponents.
The two touched the wall within 1.5 seconds of one another, finishing in 1:40.85 and 1:42.7, respectively.
Before the first break, Lee and sophomore Chris Satterthwaite gained more points for the Crimson in the 50-yard freestyle, with Lee picking up first place and Satterthwaite tying for second. Lee swam a 20.82, while Satterthwaite tied Dartmouth junior Will Derdeyn with 21.01 seconds.
Harvard displayed its depth in the one-meter diving event with a 1-2-3 sweep from Mosca, junior Michael Stanton, and sophomore Joe Zarrella. The divers scored 367.25, 306.40, and 276.80, respectively, with Mosca setting a new school record for the event.
“I dove really well,” Mosca said. “I had a new dive and everything kind of worked out and panned out well. I have to attribute my success to all the cheers from my teammates. They’re what make it the best.”
This meet was Mosca’s first non-scrimmage dual meet of the season, showing promise for helping Harvard in the competitions to come.
Satterthwaite, sophomore Danny Crigler, and Walters matched the divers after the break, also racking up serious points for the Crimson through another 1-2-3 finish. The trio stopped the clock within a second of one another with times of 45.90, 46.90, and 46.80, respectively.
Co-captain Rob Newell earned another first-place finish in the 200-yard backstroke with 1:52.83, while the 200-yard  breaststroke went to sophomore Jason Ting (2:07.62). Junior Owen Wurzbacher finished not far behind, bringing Harvard third-place points with a time of 2:09.48.
The Big Green demonstrated its strength in the 500-yard freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly, taking a first and second in the former and finishing 1-2-3 in the latter.
But the Crimson did not give up too much, following Dartmouth with a 3-4 finish by junior Greg Roop and freshman Reed Snyder in the 500. Harvard also captured fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh in the 100 with performances by Pretto, freshman Kyle McIntee, Lee, and junior Ryan Cutter.
In three-meter diving, Mosca again took first with a score of 361.95. Zarrella sealed second with 314.20 points, just passing Cornell junior Jon Zollo by 0.5 points.
The Crimson concluded the meet just as it had started it—with multiple first-place finishes. In the 200-yard individual medley, Katis touched with a time of 1:51.45, while Janney, junior Ian Mirisola, and Crigler took fourth, fifth, and sixth behind the Big Green.
The closing event, the 200-yard freestyle relay, ended in a Crimson victory over Dartmouth by .6 seconds, finishing with a time of 1:23.35.
“We have a really good group of guys who are working really hard,” Schumacher said. “We pulled through as a team and swam well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team—which took second place in the 2010 Ivy League Championships—proved that this year, it has its sights set on reaching the very top of the Ancient Eight.
It won a total of 12 out of 16 events in its first home meet of the season Saturday afternoon, in which the Crimson (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) beat Cornell (0-2, 0-2) and Dartmouth (1-1, 1-1) to take top prize at Blodgett Pool. Harvard has now won eight straight meets at home.
“It was really exciting,” said sophomore freestyle sprinter Jenna Gregoire. “This was our first chance to show the Ivy League what we’ve been working on. We swept almost every event, and our freshmen did great, which is always exciting. I think it shows that all of us are really excited for the rest of the season.”
The freshmen impressed for Harvard in almost every race in the meet. In the first heat of the 1,000-yard freestyle, rookie Courtney Otto lapped Cornell’s Katie Morin and Dartmouth’s Lindsay Tyler only 7:33 into the race. She completed the last of the 40 laps before any of her opponents were beginning their 39th.
“The freshmen are really impressive,” Gregoire said. “Every time you have a group of recruits coming up, they are generally faster than the years ahead of them. That is pretty much a given in every sport. They’ve integrated very well into our team, and [on Saturday] you could definitely see that they are really talented.”
Otto’s classmate Faith Martin earned first place in the 200-yard freestyle, while in the second heat of the 1,000-yard freestyle, fellow freshmen Kelsey Hojan-Clark finished in a time of 10:03.28, over 12 seconds ahead of any other swimmer in the heat.
Also evident on Saturday was the Crimson’s consistency across the board, as by day’s end, it had collected six 1-2 finishes. Senior Meghan Leddy also attributed this to the tight relationships of the swimmers themselves.
“We got 1-2 in most of the events, so that is definitely a good indication of the future,” Leddy said. “I think each group is very particular; they are each closely knit. Each holds each other accountable and trains together every day, so we expect a lot of each other. I think with a big team that is a necessity. It all comes together really well when we race together.”
In addition to Hojan-Clark and Otto’s performances in the 1,000-yard freestyle, the 1-2 finishes of the day included senior Catherine Zagroba and Hojan-Clark’s in the 500-yard freestyle, freshman Stephanie Ferell and junior Mackenzie Luick’s 100-yard breaststroke, Ferell and senior Helen Pitchik’s 200-yard breaststroke, Otto and sophomore Danielle Schulkin’s 200-yard butterfly, as well as Leddy and junior Caroline Weaver’s 200-yard backstroke.
In the diving portion of the meet, senior Leslie Rea pulled out a first-place finish in the one-meter dive. Despite an injury, she was able to score a total of 263.95 points.
“I actually woke up [Saturday] morning and hurt my foot, so I didn’t think I was going to dive,” Rea explained. “But I told them to tape it up, and I sucked up the pain. It’s my senior year, and I didn’t really want to miss any meets. I think things went really well, and I really couldn’t have asked for any more.”
Along with Rea’s performance, sophomore Schuyler Moore came in fifth place and classmate Alex Stanton came in seventh, earning, respectively, 242.50 and 230.30 points.
According to Rea, it will be imperative for all the squad’s members—from freshmen to seniors—to continue the sense of urgency and will to win that Harvard showed off to the rest of the Ivy world on Saturday.
“As a team I think we just want to keep supporting each other,” Otto said. “We have this quote, ‘I am who I am because who we are,’ and every practice and every meet, that is the mentality that we want to have. That is our major team goal—just to keep that mentality—and I think if we all do that, we will have a great season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team competed at the Binghamton Open Sunday in Binghamton, N.Y., and five Crimson wrestlers displayed impressive form to place within the top four in their respective weight classes. Junior Paul Liguori and junior Steven Keith earned second and third place, respectively, and junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, junior Cameron Croy, and freshman James Fox each took fourth place.
“Overall, I felt we did well,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “It was a good start, and obviously there are places where we can get better, but I think we saw a lot of good. I think, especially our younger guys, saw some competition that they’re not used to, and they’re going to continue to get better.”
Wrestling at 149 pounds and coming off of an injury he sustained during the spring semester, Liguori gave the Crimson its best finish of the weekend, reaching the finals and earning second place. In his four wins prior to the title bout, Liguori earned two falls over his opponents and racked up a combined total of 23-5.
Liguori started out the tournament strong with a pin of Sensation LaRocca from Edinboro at 2:19 and continued his dominance over Kenny Staub from Brown, taking the matchup, 11-1. In the next round, Liguori got even better, gaining another fall over Binghamton’s Ben Price at 1:40.
In the semifinals, Liguori swept past Zack Kulczycki 12-4, to earn a spot in the final. The Wantagh, N.Y., native put up a strong showing against Cornell’s Craig Eifert, but fell, 8-4. Despite the loss, Weiss was still impressed with Liguori’s performance.
“He really made a big jump over the summer and in the fall,” Weiss said. “He really made huge improvements, so I was anxious to get him on the mat ... He did a great job, and it paid off.”
Another wrestler that has made huge improvements during his Harvard wrestling career is Keith. Previously wrestling at 125 pounds, Keith stepped into his new role of competing at 133 pounds this season.
In the opening round, Keith defeated CJ Cobb of Penn, 5-2, and then followed up the victory with another win over Joe Gosinski of Hofstra, 8-5. Maintaining his momentum, Keith swept the board against Binghamton’s Dan Riggi in the next round, 6-0, before falling to Justis Flamio of NYAC, 4-2, in overtime.
In the wrestlebacks, Keith earned two more victories to secure third place at 133 pounds. Continuing his previous dominance, he defeated Jamie Franco of Hofstra, 7-0, and then took another commanding victory against CJ Cobb, 12-1, to earn a third-place finish.
Also wrestling at 133 pounds, freshman Ryan Osleeb won two of his bouts in his first collegiate wrestling tournament. Osleeb defeated Cornell’s Brett Hernandez-Henderson, 15-4, and Nassau’s Silas Murray, 12-3.
Coming into the tournament, Peppelman had a lot of attention on him after recently being ranked No. 5 in the nation and coming off of a 33-9 record during the 2010-11 season. With the pressure on his shoulders, the Harrisburg, Penn. native lived up to the expectations. He nabbed two solid victories, 6-2 and 12-0, before falling to Binghamton’s Justin Lister, 6-5, in the semifinals.
Peppelman rebounded to earn a fall at 0:37 against Rider’s Ramon Santiago and then a 9-7 victory over Edinboro’s Jonny Greisheimer. Peppelman now needs only 19 more wins to enter Harvard’s all-time top-10 list of most career victories.
Croy earned Harvard’s second fourth-place finish of the weekend. Croy dominated John McArdle of Middlesex County College, but then fell in a close 4-2 bout to Binghamton’s Nate Schiedel. Croy came back to win three more matches to secure fourth place, with Schiedel edging him out again, 5-3, in the third-place matchup.
Fox rounded out the Crimson’s top finishes, picking up fourth place at 197 lbs. Fox secured two wins over Rider’s Donald McNeil, 5-3, and Hofstra’s Tim Murphy, 11-5. In the semifinals, Fox lost against the eventual second-place finisher but went 1-1 in the wrestlebacks to end up in fourth place at his first collegiate tournament.
“It’s always good to find out where we are at this point in the season,” Weiss said. “It’s been a long preseason without any competition, so we’re always anxious going into the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just seven minutes and 23 seconds remaining in Saturday evening’s contest, Harvard junior Kaitlin Spurling scored a game-tying goal to bring the No. 10 Crimson women’s hockey team (3-1, 3-1 ECAC) dead even with a No. 2 Cornell squad (5-1, 4-1 ECAC) that has had its number for the past two years.
Eight seconds later, the status quo was back in place, and the Big Red continued on to a 5-3 win over visiting Harvard in Ithaca, N.Y.
“I know we were really excited,” said freshman forward Sarah Edney of tying things up. “It was a matter of holding on. It was a little discouraging that they came back so quickly.”
Cornell had charged out to an early lead with two power-play goals in the first 10 minutes of the night.
Big Red freshman Jillian Saunier drew first blood, capitalizing on a cross-ice pass from sophomore Alyssa Gagliardi.
A minute and a half later, Cornell senior Chelsea Karpenko made it a 2-0 Big Red lead off an feed from classmate Catherine White.
Eight minutes later, Edney put the Crimson on the board.
The goal wasn’t technically a power-play score, as the slashing penalty on Gagliardi had expired three seconds earlier, but Edney scored before Cornell had a chance to reassemble for five-on-five hockey.
It was the rookie’s first collegiate goal. Classmate Hilary Crowe picked up her first collegiate point with an assist on the play, and sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong also assisted.
“It was a matter of responding,” Edney said.
After the Big Red’s 14-10 shot advantage in the first period helped it post a 2-1 lead, the second period was more evenly distributed.
Cornell took seven shots to Harvard’s six, and the teams scored one goal apiece in the frame.
Once again, the Big Red struck first, this time off a rebound.
Crimson junior goaltender Laura Bellamy had been able to stop a shot from Gagliardi, but Cornell’s White grabbed the loose puck and stuff it into the net to push the Big Red’s lead back to two and score Cornell’s first non-power-play goal.
In the first period, Harvard and the Big Red had three and two penalties, respectively, but the second frame was much cleaner.
The Crimson was able to kill its only penalty of the period, which came 2:37 in when sophomore Marissa Gedman was called for holding the stick of one of Cornell’s players.
But when Big Red freshman forward Emily Fulton was called for elbowing, Harvard took advantage. Crowe scored 14 minutes into the second period off an assist from Armstrong—her second of the night.
Cornell didn’t find its scoring touch again until midway through the final frame, after the Crimson had brought the game even.
“We kind of knew we could do that,” Edney said of coming back. “We just had the jump and wanted to win it all.”
Instead, Spurling’s tying goal served as a wake-up call for the Big Red. Saulnier put Cornell back on top shortly after the opposing score.
And a minute and a half later, Fulton struck for the Big Red, to bring the game to 5-3, which would be the final score.
The third period was the first one in which Cornell seemed to dominate the puck—the Big Red took 16 shots to the Crimson’s four.
Bellamy made 14 saves in the period and 31 overall.
“I’m not happy with having given up that many goals,” Bellamy said of her own performance. “We can’t give up five goals and expect to win.”
It is clear what this game means for Harvard and Cornell’s records.
But what the game forecasts for the remainder of the season is more ambiguous. Because of the Four Nations Cup, which is currently taking place in Nyköping, Sweden, both the Crimson and the Big Red were without their head coaches.
Harvard was also playing without junior forward Jillian Dempsey, junior defenseman Josephine Pucci, and freshman defenseman Michelle Picard. Cornell, meanwhile, was without junior defensemen Laura Fortino and Lauriane Rougeau, sophomore forward Brianne Jenner, and senior forward Rebecca Johnston.
“We’re definitely excited to see them again later on,” Bellamy said. “It was fun to play in that environment. We were really happy with the way we played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night at the Starr Arena in Hamilton, N.Y., the Harvard women’s hockey team (3-1-0, 3-1-0 ECAC) was down three players and a coach. The setback didn’t stop the Crimson from shutting out Colgate (4-7-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) to seal a 2-0 victory in its third conference game of the season.
“I think overall, it was a good game,” captain Alisa Baumgartner said. “It took us a little while to adjust to our roster size, and at times we started to sit back and let them dictate the play, but we caught ourselves and got back to our game plan.”
Harvard was limited to 12 skaters for the game, as junior defenseman Josephine Pucci, freshman defenseman Michelle Picard, and junior forward Jillian Dempsey were away with Crimson coach Katey Stone at the Four Nations Cup in Sweden.
“Playing with a short roster was definitely a test for everyone this weekend,” Baumgartner said. “Fortunately, our team has put in the hours both on and off the ice, and conditioning was not a problem ... [sophomore Elizabeth Parker] put us on the board less than a minute into the game, which got us going.”
Just 42 seconds into the first period, sophomore forward Gina McDonald passed to her classmate Parker, who sneaked the puck in the back of the Raiders’ net, putting Harvard up, 1-0.
“Getting the lead was key,” junior goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “After that we just kept things simple, and it worked for us. We all had to help each other out, so we could save as much energy as possible, and we did a good job of that.”
Although the Crimson sought to conserve its stamina throughout the game, that didn’t stop it from out-shooting Colgate, 13-2, in the first frame, even if it could not rack up a bigger lead.
Colgate picked it up in the second period, taking 10 shots on goal, all of which were deflected by Bellamy.
Both teams took turns trading off power plays throughout the frame, but the score remained unchanged as Harvard and the Raiders both ended up 0-for-5 for the night in man-up situations.
“At this point in the season, blaming play on the basis of tiredness is just an excuse,” Baumgartner said. “We did a great job at staying mentally tough. It’s easy to tell your legs they don’t hurt when your teammates are constantly cheering.”
Toward the end of the third period, Colgate felt the pressure of the scoreboard and swapped their goalie for another shooter, putting the Crimson on the defensive.
Despite the eight shots the Raiders put on Harvard’s goal, Bellamy blocked each one, keeping the score constant. As the clock counted down toward the end of the game, sophomore Lyndsey Fry caught a pass by junior Kaitlin Spurling and scored on Colgate’s empty net with 51 seconds left, solidifying a Crimson victory.
“We feel strongly that we are a well-conditioned team,” Bellamy said. “I think we showed that in how we bared down, especially at the end when they pulled their goalie. We needed our forwards to come back and help our defensemen as much as possible, and they did a great job of that. And our defensemen handled the puck very well despite their low numbers.”
Even though Harvard only had four defenders for the night due to its shortened roster, the Crimson held strong against the Raiders. In the end, Harvard outshot Colgate, 29-20.
Bellamy proved essential in the Crimson’s victory, putting up the first shutout of the season for Harvard. Her 20 saves brought her 0.99 goals-against average—a statistic placing her at second in the nation—down to a mere 0.66.  Bellamy also increased her save percentage to .969.
“The shutout is indicative of how well the team played defensively,” Bellamy said. “We just kept things simple and limited the amount of scoring chances they had, and that was the big reason we were able to hold them scoreless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Saturday’s first-round NCAA matchup that also served as a fight for city bragging rights, the No. 12 Boston University Terriers snapped the Harvard women’s soccer team’s 10-game unbeaten streak with a convincing 3-0 victory at Nickerson Field. The Terriers move on to play Wake Forest, while the Crimson ends the year losing to its cross-town rival with the same score as when the two squads faced off earlier this season.
“It’s really, really disappointing, that result,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “I thought we played very well, a hell of a lot better than the score shows. It’s an unbelievable season that we had. It’s a shame it was cut short, but we’re proud of our efforts and that’s the game of soccer.”
The Terriers found the net first after Tiya Gallegos sent a corner kick into the middle of the box. Harvard goalkeeper Bethany Kanten jumped high to grab the ball but collided with a BU forward looking for the header. With no whistle blown and the ball bouncing in front of an open net, BU’s Kylie Strom took advantage of the opportunity and put it away for a one-goal lead with a little under 18 minutes left in the half.
“As a team, we are very close, and we’ve had a good season in terms of preparation for this game because, in the Ivy League, you can never lose a game. We had to win every single game in the Ivy League in order to get to where we were,” co-captain Lindsey Kowal said. “One game and you’re out.”
Used to coming back from behind, the Crimson tried to look for the equalizer but was forced to defend more than attack. The Terriers’ high-scoring offense dampened Harvard’s efforts, as a perfectly placed cross found BU’s Ana Cuffia, who punched in the ball for her first collegiate goal.
“Going into the NCAA tournament, we were prepared for it, but of course, there are nerves coming into this type of game, so we just had to settle down,” Kowal said. “It took some time for us to get our composure and play the game that we usually play, and unfortunately, it was a little too late.”
While Harvard played defensively in the first half, the second period was a different story. The Crimson took 14 shots in total Saturday—10 of which came in the second half—while the Terriers took 12. Kanten, in her first NCAA appearance, made four saves for the Crimson.
“I am very proud of my team,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We went for it, so we won’t lose any sleep over how we went out. That’s an important thing.”
“We were definitely taking it to them, especially the latter point of the second half. We just couldn’t find the back of the net,” Kowal agreed. “We had a lot of close chances, but I guess it just wasn’t meant to be. “
The visitors had close chance after close chance, including a Crimson free kick from three yards outside of the box after a Terrier knocked down Harvard’s Elizabeth Weisman. Freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby faked the shot and allowed sophomore Peyton Johnson to take the kick, but the ball flew straight into a BU player.
“Every single game we played the whole year, we were at least within a goal at halftime,” Leone said. “When you’re down two against a great team, that makes it an uphill battle all the way.”
The Terriers sealed the game with 28 minutes to go in the match, when a BU corner kick bounced off the bodies of both Harvard and Terrier players in Kanten’s box. After some confusion, the ball hit off senior Hana Tajii’s head into the net for an own-goal.
In its third NCAA appearance in four years, the Crimson remains scoreless in the postseason. For the senior class, which officially retired from collegiate soccer at the final whistle on Saturday, a goal and win in the NCAA tournament is all that has been missing.
“I just can’t say enough about the kind of kids that they are,” Leone said. “Remarkable four-year run. Three championships. The only thing that was not on our resume was winning an NCAA game, and that’s what we really wanted them to experience today. But that doesn’t erase away the excellence that they’ve demonstrated the last four years.”
“It hurts,” Baskind said. “It will definitely take a while to get over, but it will help looking back on the season we had, winning the Ivy League. The last part stings, but overall, I can’t complain. We enjoyed every day and best of luck to BU going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After watching Crimson football’s sloppy 30-22 loss to Holy Cross in Week 1, you never would’ve expected this.
You never would’ve expected the offense to blossom into one of the most prolific in Harvard history. You never would’ve expected the backup quarterback to step in and have the greatest two-game stretch any Crimson quarterback has ever had. And you never would’ve expected the Crimson to reel off win after win after win in dominant, unequivocal fashion.
And yet eight weeks later—eight decisive wins later—the Harvard Crimson stands alone atop the world of Ivy League football.
Saturday’s 37-20 win over Penn—coupled with Dartmouth’s shocking upset against Brown—gave Harvard the outright league title.
All season long, other than that first game, the Crimson had everyone’s number. No one could stop Harvard. Down went the Lions, the Tigers, and the Bears—oh my! Bucknell and Dartmouth looked like deer in headlights against the Mack Truck that was the Crimson, combining for just 13 points against Harvard while surrendering 83.
And while the Big Red came closest to an upset, the multi-faceted Harvard attack proved too much to handle in that 41-31 victory.
But in the end, all roads to the Ivy title travel through the Penn Quakers. The Crimson learned this the hard way over the past two seasons, with title hopes dashed in both 2009 and 2010 in the years’ penultimate games.
Coming into the season, critics thought the crown would stay in the tight grasp of Penn quarterback Billy Ragone and co. Two-time defending champions, the Quakers were the logical choice to three-peat. Deemed a juggernaut before the first kickoff of the year, the only question, it seemed, was whether anyone would come close.
In those same polls, critics chose Harvard to place second, likely envisioning a familiar scene. Both the Crimson and the Quakers would come into Harvard Stadium on Nov. 12 largely unscathed in league play. And Penn would come out on top, sealing its fate as the Ancient Eight king once more.
This year, the two actors switched roles. Don Corleone was given the offer he couldn’t refuse. Jack Nicholson couldn’t handle the truth.
Because on Saturday, it was Penn whose championship hopes were dashed. And it was Harvard which came out on top.
The Crimson left no doubt as to which team would be crowned. Playing like an Ivy League champion, Harvard opened up a resounding 37-7 lead—scoring 37 unanswered points before stepping on the brakes, allowing the visitors to claw back to within 17 points.
After a rocky first quarter, the game quickly became a coronation ceremony for the Crimson, a peaceful transfer of power.
But victory didn’t look assured in that first quarter, after the Quakers built a 7-0 lead and managed to hold Harvard scoreless. No other team had shut down the Crimson attack so effectively in an opening period.
More than that, for those first 15 minutes, the Quakers penetrated the Harvard offensive line with more success than any of the Crimson’s eight previous foes, and senior quarterback Collier Winters barely had time to blink before the Penn D-line had him surrounded.
In the second quarter, the balance of power began to shift rapidly in the Crimson’s favor, starting with a play just over a minute into the frame.
Deep in Quaker territory, Penn running back Jeff Jack ran into Harvard sophomore linebacker Matt Martindale. That’s when senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz took matters into his own hands—literally. The All-American punched the ball loose and fell on it, giving the Crimson tremendous field position. One play later, Winters hit sophomore tight end Cameron Brate in the end zone for the equalizing touchdown.
That proved to be the beginning of the end for the Quakers because, as Harvard coach Tim Murphy put it, the Crimson found its rhythm. The O-line patched up its holes, giving Winters breathing room and allowing the running game to flourish. Harvard rattled off 30 more points before Penn found the end zone again midway through the fourth quarter. But by that point, the Fat Lady was in the middle of an aria.
As time wound down at Harvard Stadium and the clock struck midnight on Penn’s title chances, a drenched Murphy led his team onto the field as the victors. Not just of the game, but of the title, of the Ancient Eight season.
To the untrained eye, then, it would seem that next week’s contest at the Yale Bowl is inconsequential. Without any league title implications attached, with nothing more than pride on the line, the game means nothing.
But crown or no crown, Ivy title or not, The Game is still The Game. It means everything.
And so, the Crimson’s work isn’t over just yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, it came to an end in a torrential downpour at Harvard Stadium, with a 17-7 defeat.
One year later, it was over at Franklin Field, where four Harvard turnovers gave Penn its second straight title.
But on Saturday, things were different.
After its title dreams were shattered by the Quakers in the year’s penultimate contest for two consecutive seasons, the Crimson was not to be denied this time around.
This time, it was Harvard’s year.
This time, the Crimson were champions.
With a 37-20 thrashing of Penn (5-4, 4-2 Ivy) on its home turf, No. 14 Harvard (8-1, 6-0) remained unscathed in 2011 Ivy play, won its eighth straight game, and, most importantly, clinched the Ivy League title outright with one game—The Game—still to go.
With a little help from Dartmouth—whose 21-16 victory over Brown earlier in the afternoon eliminated the Bears from contention—Harvard won its first title since 2008 and its 14th all-time.
“It never gets old, I guarantee you that,” said Harvard coach Tim Murphy, who won his sixth championship in 18 years at the helm of the Crimson. “When you don’t win one, it honestly feels very hard to get back there. It’s the culmination of so much hard work. ... This is what makes it worthwhile.”
Facing its first real test since Brown seven weeks ago, Harvard looked as dominant as ever, scoring 30-plus points for the seventh straight game—the first time since 1890 a Crimson squad has accomplished that feat—and, most impressively, doing so against the top-ranked defense in the conference.
To win, Harvard did two things—it ran the ball effectively, and it stopped the run even more so.
Freshman Zach Boden and junior Treavor Scales combined for 151 yards on the ground on just 21 carries, good for 7.2 yards per attempt. In comparison, the Crimson averaged just 3.3 yards per carry against the Quakers in their past two meetings.
Both Boden and Scales each also scored touchdowns, the rookie on a 14-yard scamper to put Harvard up, 14-7, with just over a minute left in the first half, and the veteran on a two-yard score to put the Crimson ahead, 30-7, early in the fourth.
Defensively, Harvard limited the Quakers to just 24 yards on the ground on 30 attempts. Last year, Penn rushed for 206 yards against Harvard in its championship-clinching win.
“I think the line of scrimmage was strictly won by their kids,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “We struggled more than any time this year to run the football. We became one-dimensional.”
Defensive tackle Josué  Ortiz played a major role in limiting the Quaker offense. The senior was dominant in the first quarter, recording two key sacks—his eighth and ninth of the year.
Early in the second, after Penn had scored to go up, 7-0, and Harvard had gone three-and-out on its ensuing drive, Ortiz singlehandedly swung the momentum of the game when he forced Penn’s Jeff Jack to fumble at his own 24, then recovered the loose ball.
“I was double-teamed by the center and guard, and I tried to push the pile back,” said Ortiz, who finished with 10 tackles on the afternoon. “I just ripped at the ball; I didn’t think it would come out.”
The turnover gave the Crimson great field position, which Winters took immediate advantage of, hitting sophomore tight end Cameron Brate over the middle on the next play for a 24-yard game-tying touchdown. From there, the Crimson offense never looked back, scoring 37 unanswered points on its way to the title.
“It feels great,” Winters said. “This was definitely a game we marked on the schedule, hoping we’d be in this position, being able to play for the championship. It means a lot and personally it means a lot to beat Penn, since they’ve taken it from us the past couple of years.”
“[The best part] is definitely coming back in the locker room and being able to share it with your teammates, who you’ve worked hard for it with the whole year,” captain Alex Gedeon added.
As soon as the public address announcer reported the Dartmouth win, a roar rippled through the 11,000-person crowd Harvard Stadium and the players—with about 10 minutes still remaining in the game—began to celebrate the inevitable.
They knew they had succeeded where their two predecessors had failed. They had toppled the mighty Quakers, who had received 12 first-place preseason votes in August, while Harvard had gotten just two.
“We played the better team today,” Bagnoli said. “They dominated play—they deserved to win.”
For Winters and Ortiz, the victory gave vindication to a decision made months ago to return to Harvard as fifth-year seniors, solely for the purpose of winning another ring.
“You put all the work in, and this makes it worthwhile,” Ortiz said. “This is the pinnacle; this is what you always want to do as a Harvard football player.”
But for Gedeon, Winters, and Ortiz, the championship marked somewhat of a bittersweet moment, as it also marked the last game the trio—as well as 18 of their senior teammates—would play at Harvard Stadium.
“We practice there every day, and we’ve now played 20 games in that stadium,” Gedeon said. “It’s always going to be something special, getting the win in that last one.”
After winning a title as freshmen in 2008, the win brought the seniors’ careers full circle.
“I think it’ll set in a little deeper after the Yale game next week,” Winters said. “But it was a great feeling to be able to run out of the tunnel through the line of guys, knowing it’s your last game. I had a moment to kind of look out and just play through my five years here and really take that second to realize the journey I’ve been on.”
It was the preseason All-American who had the final word.
“It hasn’t really hit me yet,” Ortiz said. “At practice Thursday, that’s when I’ll take our last lap with the lights off—that’s our tradition. Once that’s over with, I’ll look back.”
“It’ll maybe be emotional,” he added. “But I’m not making any promises.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard men’s hockey, four is a lucky number. In its fourth game of the season, the Crimson squad won its first game of the year, soundly defeating Colgate, 4-2, on Saturday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
In its second game of the weekend, Harvard (1-2-1, 1-2-1 ECAC) bounced back after losing to Cornell on Friday night and took a comfortable win over No. 18 Colgate (6-4-1, 2-2-0).
“We are excited for the first win. I thought our guys really battled under some tough circumstances early,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought a lot of guys stepped up and made some plays not only to stay in the game but to win the game.”
Consistent with every game this season, the Crimson faced an early deficit, and only 7:31 into the game, Colgate defenseman Spiro Goulakos took a shot close to the blue line that freshman goalie Steve Michalek saved, but was unable to hold onto, and Colgate’s forward Robbie Bourdon put the puck into the back of the net.
The ice was at times sparsely populated on Saturday night, but the penalty box was busy all evening.
Over the three periods of play, there was a total of 21 penalties amongst the two teams, 16 of which came in the second period.
“I think it was certainly one of the craziest periods I have ever been involved with as a player or a coach,” Donato said. “It was one of the most exhausting games that I have been a part of.”
Just 3:54 into the second period, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally had a shot on goal that was blocked, and Harvard left wingman Rence Coassin shot the deflection into the back of the net to even the game at one.
Less than a minute later, junior defenseman Danny Biega was charged with a game misconduct and was ousted from play. Biega’s game misconduct is the second such penalty for the Crimson in its last two games.
Colgate capitalized on Biega’s departure, and Austin Smith scored a power-play goal for the Raiders, giving them a 2-1 advantage.
Despite trailing, Harvard kept its composure and took advantage of Colgate penalties to claw its way back into the game.
For the Crimson, one costly Colgate penalty proved to be a turning point in the game. Raiders wingman Nick Prockow was thrown out of the contest for grasping the facemask about 15 minutes into the second period.
After his ejection, the Crimson capitalized on a five-on-three situation when McNally scored his first goal of the season 16:32 into the second period.
“It was just a five-on-three—a good opportunity to score, and I got one in the slot and let one go, and it was lucky enough to go in,” McNally said.
McNally’s goal was followed 79 seconds later with a goal from senior forward Alex Killorn. The score gave Harvard a 3-2 lead—the team’s first of the season.
In addition to taking advantage of the power play, Harvard’s freshmen made a big difference in Saturday night’s game.
Coming off a strong performance against Cornell in which he allowed only one goal in two periods of action, freshman goalie Steve Michalek was given the starting nod and took advantage of the opportunity.
Michalek had 30 saves on the night and made several impressive stops in the third period when Colgate was threatening.
“He made at least three saves that were ESPN-type saves,” Donato said. “I think it gave our bench a big boost.”
Freshman Colin Blackwell took control of the game during the third period. Only 2:43 into the final frame, the freshman skated down the rink and rifled an angled shot that was too much for Colgate goalie Erik Mihalik to stop.
After his goal early in the period, Blackwell had several more scoring opportunities that he was unable to convert, including a break away chance muffed by a misfire.
The Crimson held off some late Colgate comeback attempts to win the game, ending a three-game losing streak to start the year.
“The first three games [of the season], we played pretty well … It was time to bury down and get the W,” Blackwell said. “We felt like we are good, we have confidence in one another. We went out there and had opportunities, and tonight, we buried them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the finale of a lackluster Ivy League season, the Harvard men’s soccer team hosted Ancient Eight foe Penn. Playing under the lights at Soldier’s Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, the Crimson hoped to put on a great performance for its packed stand of fans, who were out in full force on Senior Night. But what transpired was unexpected.
Saturday night’s match featured 24 total fouls, one red card, three yellow cards, one penalty kick, an on-field fight between both teams, two goals in the span of three minutes, a 90th-minute goal, and an overtime winner.
Though the Crimson (2-12-3, 0-6-1 Ivy) ultimately fell to the Quakers (8-7-2, 3-4-0 Ivy), 3-2, in double overtime, the match served as an electric conclusion to an otherwise dull regular season.
“I felt that we had a pretty good game,” freshman midfielder Tim Schmoll said. “We had a pretty strong performance, especially given the fact that we were a man down really early in the match. We knew that Penn was a team that liked to move the ball around a lot, and I think that if we had played them 11-on-11, we could have had a different result. Even though we only had 10 men on the field, we did hold a 1-0 lead for much of the game. I think that the team overall had a strong performance.”
Both teams started strong from the start, battling to dominate possession and having several good looks on goal.
In the 13th minute, the ball was slotted through the Penn back line to senior forward Jamie Rees, who was kept onside by a deep defender on the opposite side of the field. Taking two long touches into the box, Rees found himself in a one-on-one opportunity against the fast approaching Penn keeper, but his shot on goal flew just wide of the right post.
But Harvard’s strong offensive start early in the game was halted by a defensive slip-up. In the 17th minute, Harvard faced a major setback when sophomore Pascal Mensah slide-tackled a Quaker from behind and took out his feet. Mensah’s tackle earned him a red card from the referee and forced the Crimson to play with a man down.
But despite having just 10 men on the field, Harvard continued to place pressure on the Quakers back line. The Crimson’s offensive efforts eventually paid off in the 21st minute, when a Penn defender took down a Crimson forward in the box, gifting Harvard a penalty kick. Junior co-captain Scott Prozeller stepped up to the spot and drilled the ball into the lower right corner of the net to earn the lead.
Despite both teams having opportunities on net, with the Quakers outshooting the Crimson, 8-5, senior goalkeeper Austin Harms recorded four saves to preserve Harvard’s 1-0 lead going into halftime.
The match picked up from where it last left off after the break, with both sides having solid opportunities on goal.
Eight minutes into the second half, Harvard had its best opportunity on goal when sophomore forward Connor McCarthy took a well-placed header to the bottom left corner of goal. But Penn goalkeeper Tyler Kinn’s well-timed dive to the corner robbed McCarthy of his goal and kept the Quakers in the game.
With less than 25 minutes to play in the second, the level of intensity on the field increased, as both sides searched for a late second half goal.
In the 76th minute, tensions on the pitch came to a boiling point as freshman forward Michael Innocenzi and Penn defender Jake Levin jostled for the ball in midfield. While struggling to win the ball from each other, both players went down and immediately sprang up from the ground shoving each other. The referees and linesmen attempted to reassert control and separate the brawling players.
Once the play resumed, Penn’s offense took control of the match and began placing immense pressure on the Crimson back line. In the 80th minute, Penn’s offensive efforts paid off when Penn forward Thomas Brandt, working off a cross into the penalty area, scored off a well-taken header to tie the game at one. Less than two minutes later, Brandt once again headed the ball into the goal off a corner kick, giving Penn the lead, 2-1, and leaving the home crowd stunned.
As the clock ticked down, Harvard searched desperately for a last minute goal. With only 55 seconds remaining in regulation, a hand-ball call on a Penn defender gifted the Crimson a free kick, and sophomore defender Ross Friedman placed the ball in front of the goal for Schmoll to head it past the keeper for the game-tying tally.
In overtime, Penn’s offense took complete control of the match, outshooting Harvard, 5-0. Early in the second overtime, the Quakers’ relentless pressure proved to be too much for the Crimson, as Brandt tipped the ball past Harms off a free kick to earn Penn the overtime victory and the hat trick.
“It was disappointing to lose, but I think we put together a good performance,” Harms said. “I was proud of the way we played, and it was great for the seniors to know everyone was out there working as hard as they did for us. Everyone kept their heads in the game for the full 90 minutes. I think it speaks a lot to our character as a team and how far we’ve come since last year since we were so cohesive as a unit. It was an emotional game for everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into the season, one of the biggest questions for Harvard men’s hockey was its goalie situation. In the first few games of the year, sophomore Raphael Girard and freshman Steve Michalek have split time in the net, and neither was able to set himself apart from the other in goal.
After a solid performance against a ranked Quinnipiac team last week—the Crimson tied its ECAC opponent 2-2—Girard won the start in goal on Friday night.
But against Cornell (2-2-0, 2-1-0 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Center, he could not keep Harvard (0-2-1, 0-2-1) close, surrendering three goals in the first 10 minutes of the game before coming out at the start of the second period.
“It was a tough call, but [starting Girard] was a decision we made,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Then, after the first, I thought … we needed a little bit of a change, [a] momentum change for ourselves.”
Despite his success earlier this year, Girard was hurt by a weakened Harvard defense. Cornell scored its second goal in a 5-on-3 situation, and 56 seconds later scored again on the power play. The Crimson’s penalty kill struggled, as the Big Red scored in two of its four chances with a one- or two-man advantage.
Cornell dominated possession time in the first period, taking 18 shots in the frame. Harvard managed only three.
“[Girard] was solid last weekend, and he earned the start [on Friday],” Michalek said. “I really thought he played well tonight. They really took it to us in the first period with that power play, and that’s how it’s going to be all season, going back-and-forth [and] competing for playing time.”
When Michalek came into the game, Harvard reversed the pace of the contest. The Crimson outshot Cornell in the second and third periods by a 17-8 margin, but the team never recovered from the Big Red’s three early goals.
“It’s always tough coming off the bench after just sitting there,” Michalek said. “My mindset was just [to] do whatever you can to keep your team in the game.”
PENALTY KILLORN
In addition to defensive struggles early on, Harvard was hit hard with penalties in the first period. Just under seven minutes into the game, senior forward Alex Killorn was hit with a major penalty near the Harvard goal for grasping the facemask.
After a minor confrontation on the ice, play was stopped for a few minutes as the referees broke up the fight and discussed the penalty situation.
In addition to the five-minute penalty kill—a time frame during which Cornell scored twice—Killorn was given a game misconduct, removing him for the rest of the evening.
Already down 1-0 when Killorn was ejected and down 3-0 just minutes later, his absence was a major blow to the team’s chances. Coming into the game, the senior forward had scored two of the Crimson’s five goals and had assisted on a third.
“My overall version of the play was, quite frankly, I thought it was an embellishment,” Donato said. “It’s always difficult in a big game to have a five-minute penalty kill. Add the fact that [Killorn] happens to be, from my estimation, one of the best hockey players in the league, and it makes for a more difficult night.”
Harvard did capitalize on some of its power-play chances in the second period, first on a score from junior forward Marshall Everson and then on a goal from junior forward Alex Fallstrom in the closing seconds of the frame.
But after pulling within one goal, the Big Red scored with three-and-a-half minutes in the game to push its lead to two, and Harvard could not come back.
“If the [shots] go through in the first and second period, it’s a completely different game,” Everson said. “He stayed solid all night. The goals we had, both power-play goals, we had to work hard for.”
The Crimson has struggled on the power play this season, even when Killorn is in the game. Coming into Friday’s game, the team had scored on just two of its eight chances, and despite some success in the second period, Harvard could not take advantage of chances in the third.
“We got two power-play goals, [but] we needed to get an even-strength goal and weren’t able to get it,” Donato said. “I give [Cornell] credit. They defend very well; their goaltender made some big saves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a somewhat slow start to the weekend, by dropping a 3-0 decision to Yale on Friday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (12-12, 5-9 Ivy) never looked back once it got on the board Saturday night. The Crimson ended its season strongly with a win 3-1 win over Brown (6-19, 2-12) on Harvard’s Senior Night.
“It was our last game playing together as one team,” said co-captain and libero Christine Wu. “We just wanted to go all out, end our season on a good note, and have absolutely no regrets.”
After losing the first set, the Crimson rallied to win three consecutive sets against the Bears and take the match. The win gave the Harvard team a solid .500 record for the season overall and lifted the Crimson to 5-9 in Ivy League play.
“I thought it was an awesome performance and such a great way to end our season,” said fellow co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer. “All of the girls came together, and I think this was the best volleyball we have played this season.
Brown came out strongly in the opening set. Trailing the Bears, 21-11, Harvard called a timeout and won the next five points, but the 10-point deficit was simply too large to make up.
“We had a little bit of a slow start, and Brown was playing very aggressively,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We seemed a bit hesitant. Sometimes, it just takes a little longer to get your rhythm going. But we did a great job of getting ourselves into system and shifting a couple of things around.”
The second set proved to be a more even matchup. The score remained close throughout, with crucial ties at 22 and 24 points.
The Crimson offense kicked into gear, taking three of the next four points to earn the set, 27-25. After leveling the score at one game each, Harvard dominated the rest of the night. The Crimson took the final two sets, 25-16, 25-19.
“We wanted to work on getting into our offensive and defensive systems,” said Weiss of the team’s mission heading into the second set. “We really needed to rely on each other and start trusting each other. [Junior setter] Beth Kinsella did a really nice job of starting to get the hitters one-on-one and setting the ball to move Brown’s defense.”
Junior outside hitter Taylor Docter was also a standout player, recording a double-double with 15 kills and 16 digs during the game, while sophomore Natalie Doyle and Wu led the defense with 24 kills apiece, bringing the senior to 523 on the season. Fryhofer contributed at the net with seven blocks and eight kills of her own.
“Our seniors were great,” Weiss said. “This is how Wu plays defense; she’s played that way since the day she got here. It was a great way for them to end.”
After a tough loss to the Bulldogs the previous night, in which Yale clinched the Ivy League championship, the Crimson was focused on playing the game to the best of its abilities to close out the season.
“Yale is a good team,” Wu said. “Coming into today, we just really wanted to focus on our system and playing the best we can. Every ball you touch could be your last for the season. We wanted to play Harvard volleyball, play for each other, and play together.”
Before the start of the game, the Harvard team held a ceremony honoring its two seniors, Fryhofer and Wu. In her career on the team, Fryhofer has recorded over 700 kills and 250 blocks. Wu currently holds the Harvard record for most career digs and ranks second all-time in the Ivy League.
“It was our last game, and we wanted to make it count,” Fryhofer said. “We knew it was the last time all 14 girls, this team, would be together. I think we really played with our hearts. When you play with desire, that is when you are at your peak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Yale freshman Mollie Rogers’ perfectly-placed kill landed in the middle of four Harvard (11-12, 4-9 Ivy) players to seal a convincing 3-0 victory for the Bulldogs (18-5, 12-1), Yale players began celebrating not just a victory over a conference rival but an Ivy League championship.
The Bulldogs were presented with their second consecutive Ivy League trophy—and third in four years—as Crimson players looked on.
The first set proved to be the most competitive, making the game seem like it would be a back-and-forth affair. After exchanging scoring runs, the two teams found themselves knotted at 11 apiece. The set was hotly contested, and the teams tied five more times throughout the frame. But Rogers’ strong finishes and a few Crimson errors allowed the Bulldogs to close the set out, 25-20.
In a day characterized by missed chances, Harvard lost the last point of the set on a service error.
“You just can’t make that one mistake in such a game of momentum,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.
Yale pulled away after the first set and never gave the Crimson a chance to recover. The Bulldogs led by as many as nine in the second set and closed out the frame, 25-17. Yale then finished the third set with a 12-point advantage, 25-13.
Harvard was unable to prevent sustained Bulldog scoring runs, as the visitors racked up a .302 hitting average. Yale demonstrated its ability to put up points consistently when it scored eight straight points in the first set, establishing its dominance early on.
Harvard’s defense was at times overwhelmed by Yale’s powerful hitters, who were very successful around the net. Whenever the Crimson was poised to make a run, the Bulldogs came up with a kill in response.
“We’re proud of how we played tonight,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We fought with them—it just wasn’t enough.”
The Crimson clearly had trouble keeping up, and it was mainly due to missed kill opportunities.
Junior outside hitter Taylor Doctor led the team with 10 kills for the Crimson, doing so on 39 total chances. Sophomore middle blocker Teresa Skelly and rookie outside hitter Kristen Casey were close behind with seven kills apiece.
Converting kill chances was an area that Harvard struggled with throughout the match. It had a .121 kill percentage compared with the Bulldog’s .302 kill rate.
This consistency from the Yale outside hitters was a deciding factor in the outcome. Yale killed 46 total balls, and only had 11 errors. Harvard, on the other hand, put away only 32 balls and recorded 17 errors.
Rogers led the Bulldogs with 17 kills, and Yale freshman Allie Frappier contributed 11 kills to the championship-winning effort.
But there were some bright spots for the Crimson. Casey was relentless in her pursuit of the ball, on her way to recording seven kills and 13 digs. Wu also contributed on the defensive end, registering 16 digs, bringing her total to 499 in 2011—a new season-high for digs.
“We passed very well, and our defense was very good,” Weiss said. “We had a lot of high percentages—they just beat us.”
Yale also won the first matchup earlier in the season, again blanking Harvard, 3-0. But Wu noted that Harvard had a different attitude and game plan going into this encounter.
“Looking back on our first game, we knew we were a different team,” she said. “We’ve improved so much throughout the season. We had a different line up and a great new system … we’re going to go into our game with Brown [Saturday] with the same momentum, the same fire.”
Weiss echoed Wu’s attitude.
“I think we have to go on to the next play and take it one point at a time,” Weiss said. “So if you make a mistake on one play, you go on to the next point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up against fields of nearly 250 runners from 36 schools, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams were back in action on Saturday for the NCAA Northeast Regional Cross Country Meet. The Crimson squads turned in solid performances against their regional foes at the University of Buffalo’s Audubon Golf Course. The men finished in 15th place, while the women raced to a 14th-place finish.
“I was pleased with how our teams competed today,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “They went out on a windy, blustery day and gave us a really good effort.”
On the women’s side, sophomore Morgan Kelly paced the Crimson. The San Francisco, Calif. native crossed the finish line in 21:58.3, which was good for 49th place overall. Kelly has been a consistent runner for Harvard all year, but her outing on Saturday may have elevated her to the next level.
“I was extremely happy with Morgan’s performance,” Saretsky said. “She really went out there and stepped it up for us. It was a breakout performance for her.”
Behind Kelly for the Crimson was freshman Viviana Hanley, who bolstered her impressive freshman campaign by coming in 66th place. Hanley covered the six-kilometer course in 22:18.1. Senior Jeanne Mack and captain Kirsten Jorgenson were hot on the rookie’s heels, crossing the finish line with respective times of 22:20.5 and 22:24.3.
True to what has been their 2011 form, the Harvard women ran as a pack in Saturday’s race. The top-five finishers for the Crimson all crossed the finish line within a one-minute span.
“We’ve been working on running as a pack and working together all year,” Saretsky said. “[The women’s team] gave a great effort today.”
For the Harvard men, junior Jakob Lindaas once again rose to the occasion in his team’s most important meet of the season to date. Lindaas was the Crimson’s top runner two weekends ago at the Heptagonal Championship Meet. The junior followed up his Heps performance by finishing the men’s 10-kilometer race in 32:35.2, which earned him 45th place.
In a season in which many of Harvard’s top runners have battled injuries, Lindaas indicated that his main focus was to stay healthy while continuing to improve as the season progressed. The Crimson coaching staff has recognized Lindaas’ development in 2011.
“Jakob has grown by leaps and bounds this season,” Saretsky said. “He’s really beginning to establish himself as a strong, competitive runner for us.”
Despite the relative flatness of the Audubon Golf Course, Lindaas and his teammates had to overcome some unfavorable racing conditions on Saturday. Constant winds and gusts of 20 miles per hour hampered runners as they made their way to the finish line.
“The wind would be at your back on some portions of the course,” Lindaas said. “You’d be flying along. But at other portions, you would be hitting it head-on.
Sophomores James Leakos, Aaron Watanabe, and Kellen Blumberg were behind Lindaas for Harvard, finishing in 65th, 89th, and 103rd places, respectively. The Crimson’s sophomore class has shown its depth throughout the course of the year, in spite of injuries that have marred the squad’s roster.
“James, Kellen, and Aaron are all very talented,” Saretsky said. “They’ve had an up-and-down season, but it was great for them to get out there and represent Harvard.”
Among the schools the Crimson faced at the meet were Ancient Eight rivals Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, Cornell and Yale. The Columbia men had the most impressive outing, earning third place overall with 96 points. Harvard fell to each of its Ivy League rivals.
“We wanted to improve upon our standing from [the Heptagonal Cross Country meet,]” Lindaas said. “It was our goal to go out there and beat Yale. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to do that today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A dilemma for many athletes is balancing school and their sport.  Yale quarterback Patrick Witt ’12 had to face this challenge in a big way—he had to decide whether to play against Harvard this Saturday or to take his interview for the Rhodes Scholarship, which happened to be on the same day.  He chose The Game.
This is no decision that could have been made by picking a daisy in a field, plucking the petals off one by one, and saying “play, interview, play, interview…”  This was a serious pro-con list situation.
If he chose to fly to Georgia, his home state in which he applied to the scholarship, instead of going to the game, he would be letting his team down.  Without him, the Bulldogs would have start one of their sophomore quarterbacks, who don’t come close to Witt’s passing yards.
Witt has thrown 2142 yards in the nine games he has played in this year, earning him a spot in Yale history as the quarterback with the most yards for complete passes.  He has also made 312 plays to date for the season and averages 229.2 yards per game, taking sacks into account.
Now with stats like those, why wouldn’t Witt just pick the game right off the bat?  Oh, right, because the Rhodes Scholarship is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity.  The chance to study in any master’s program at Oxford for two years complicates the matter a bit.  Then there’s the aspect of the scholarship that puts a high value on leadership position—the very thing Witt would have abandoned if he went to the interview instead of leading his teammates against the Crimson.
In the end, the senior quarterback decided that he was an essential part of the team with his passing talent. So he dumped his scholarship application in pursuit of another once in a lifetime opportunity: beating Harvard, something the Bulldogs haven't pulled off since 2006.
Witt isn’t the only Yale football player who has had to make such a decision.  In 2008, Casey Gerald ’09 had a similar situation, except that he got lucky and his Rhodes District was split, so he had the choice to hold his interview on Friday or on Saturday.  Witt wasn’t as fortunate, as his district decided to hold all of their interviews on the same day.
This instance is similar to one that happened here at Harvard, except this one ended with a double happy ending.  Wide receiver Zar Zavala ’10 was a walk-on on the football team, worked his butt off during his career, and played in the Game his senior year.  After the game, his fiancée, Melanie, gives him his phone, which had a text informing him that he was a Rhodes Scholar for that year.
Well, some people just have it all and for the rest of us, we just have to make do with the choices we make.  As for Witt, he decided to stick with his team until the end.  Maybe the football gods will grant Yale a win in return, maybe not.
See you in New Haven on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with pristine morning conditions on the Charles, the Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight crews took to the water to take on opponents from far and near in the annual Foot of the Charles Regatta Saturday.
The Black and White heavyweights and lightweights, coming off dominant showings at the Head of the Charles Regatta last October, returned to their home waters hoping to make a statement in the last race of the fall season.
In the varsity four race, the heavyweight A four was the top boat in the regatta, finishing the course in the fastest time of the day and taking first in the A four class, while the heavyweight B four finished in 10th place overall and fourth among B four boats. The lightweight A four finished in 19th place and second overall among lightweight A fours, while the lightweight B finished in 24th place overall and first in its boat class.
In the novice eight, the Radcliffe A boat captured first place, just head of local rival Boston College, while the Radcliffe lightweight A novice eight finished 18th overall and first among novice eight crews.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
After a pair of strong finishes at the Head of the Charles Regatta last month with the Black and White 1V and 2V earning second and 22nd-place finishes in the Championship Eights respectively, the Radcliffe heavyweights were eager to bookend their fall season with another strong showing on the water.
“I thought we all did great as a whole this past weekend,” junior Marissa D'Orsogna said. “It was a nice end to the season, and I think overall we are in a good place heading into winter training.”
In the Regatta’s main event—the varsity four race—the heavyweights fielded three boats, each of which was assigned a different boat class assigned by letter. The heavyweight A four was the top finisher for the Black and White, finishing the course in 13:45.7. With that time, the heavyweight A four, led by senior coxswain and co-captain Jill Carlson, sophomore Deva Steketee and  juniors Michelle Pearson, Mary Maginnis and Scout Moran, earned first place overall in the varsity four and in their boat class. Ivy foe Brown finished second overall and among other A fours over 20 seconds behind Radcliffe, in 14:06.1.
The Black and White heavyweights had strong showings in other boat classes. The varsity B four finished fourth in its class in 14:33.6, behind Rhode Island and the Bears, who finished three and five seconds ahead, respectively. Syracuse earned a first-place finish among the Varsity B fours in 14:07.3.
With the fall racing season having come to a close, the Radcliffe heavyweights look to carry some of the lessons learned on the water into their winter training and future competitions during the spring racing season.
“There is a lot that happens between now and spring season,” D'Orsogna said. “Ending on a good note was a great moral booster, but we have to go into winter training with the strong mentality that we’ve picked up from the fall. We know that there is always room for improvement and we are going to improve during our winter training ”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
After strong showing in the Head of the Charles Regatta, the lightweights looked to pick up where they left off last month.
“I think we did well overall as a team,” senior coxswain Maryana Vrubel said. “The Foot is a race where we race mostly heavyweight crews, so we just go out and have a good race and see where we place. It’s always a fun race for us because it's so low pressure.”
Though both the heavyweights and lightweights were faced with a slight challenge in the form of the format of the regatta’s main event—a four-person boat instead of the typical eight-person—the lightweights, much like their heavyweight counterparts did not disappoint, as three out of the five lightweight boats took first place in their respective boat class.
“4V races are more technique-based because you are racing with just four rowers and rowing a lot more,” Vrubel said.  “But overall, it is a great opportunity to work on your technique, skills and learn how to move better as a boat.”
The lightweight A four, led by sophomore Elizabeth Lenczowski, junior Elizabeth Hamilton, co-captain Emma Lukasiewicz, senior Kelly McCarthy, finished the course with a time of 14:51.6, earning 19th-place overall and second-place among lightweight A fours. Buffalo emerged victorious in the lightweight A four with a time of 14:45.6.
Among lightweight B fours however, the Black and White finished in 24th place overall and first in its class with a time of 15:04.7.
The lightweights finished in 18th-place overall in the novice eight in 16:16.1, but first place in its class over local rivals MIT and UMass.
