After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s not a whole lot to say about last week’s episode of “Big Little Lies,” “Push Comes to Shove.” Mostly, the episode feels like plot wheel-spinning: Jane continues to struggle with the idea that Ziggy might have inherited a propensity for violence, Madeline continues to flail silently, and Celeste sits on her therapist’s couch and uneasily denies that she’s afraid of her husband. The writing and acting remain consistently excellent, especially in a few standout moments. The showrunners began to drop intriguing hints about something being wrong with Ed—at one point, he stares at Bonnie through prison-like window slats—and a brilliant plot twist surfaces as Madeline hesitantly reveals an affair with her co-director. The best scene, though, (unsurprisingly) involves Nicole Kidman’s Celeste. Wearing a magnificent power suit, she sits with Madeline in her car and painfully admits that she wants to go back to work. Vocalizing a dilemma so many women face, she explains that motherhood has completely overwhelmed her sense of duty to herself—and her longing for self-fulfillment bursts out in a moment of confused joy, pain and fury. “I fucking miss it!” she howls, slamming her hand down on the horn.
If “Push Comes to Shove” was a conventionally strong episode, though, “Once Bitten” reaches new and absolutely spectacular emotional heights. The episode signals an increase in intensity from its very first moments, invoking a nightmare, the edge of a cliff, a howl, and music with a beat like a frantic pulse; these powerful motifs continue throughout the episode and feel entirely appropriate for the turmoil that each main character faces. Shailene Woodley gives Jane a new kind of loose, broken fury after last week’s move towards composure, flooring it on the highway with a joint in her mouth as she goes to confront someone who might be her rapist. Madeline, meanwhile, grows increasingly, achingly brittle as she struggles to understand her own infidelity and find a way back to Ed.
And then there’s Celeste. In the best and most wrenching scene that the show has done so far, Dr. Reisman steadily leads Celeste to the realization that she’s experiencing abuse, that what she’s going through is neither normal nor safe. “Have you ever been afraid that you were going to die?” she asks. Celeste looks shocked. “Never!” she snaps back, and then she flinches, looks away, and wipes away tears. The screen cuts to a harrowing glimpse of Perry pressing Celeste’s struggling head into a pillow, then back to a shaking Celeste and an intensely concerned therapist. “That must have been terrifying,” says Dr. Reisman. Somehow, almost imperceptibly, the actors then convey that they have suddenly gone from being adversaries to allies, and there’s a snap of action as Dr. Reisman tells Celeste that they need to make a plan for the next time that Perry hits her. In the next scene, Celeste and her boys run through an airport—and it seems like she might actually be leaving Perry, but then it turns out that they’ve just gone to meet him in Arrivals. And he sobs into her shoulder.
It’s a devastatingly well-crafted episode, especially in these moments of immense and submerged emotional complexity, but it succeeds primarily because all of the agony rings so intensely true. The plots of the three main characters each allow the show to explore a particularly common element of female experience with enormous sympathy and nuance, a kind of painful respect that few shows in recent memory have been able to muster. Despite the title, the series continues to prove itself as an unusually honest piece of work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The creators of “Beauty and the Beast” seem to have constructed the film to evoke and exploit millennial nostalgia. Many of the costumes, scenes, and songs are identical to those in the 1991 animated classic . The casting of Emma Watson, whose headstrong and book-loving Belle is in many ways a slightly modified version of her beloved “Harry Potter” character Hermione, may also be an appeal to the young adults who grew up watching her films. But the obvious pitfall of such a nostalgic remake is that it invites comparison to the original, and this film is at best a hollow imitation of the truly magical classic on which it is based.
Watching the early scenes of Belle ambling through her home village is the cinematic equivalent of returning to Disneyland for the first time in years and realizing that all the castles are made of plaster and coated in child-snot. The director has made little attempt to lend realism to this adaptation—sure, this is a children’s movie based on a fairy tale, but the glaring artificiality of each scene makes it difficult to become immersed in the fantasy. Why do only some characters have (atrocious) French accents? Why is the fleur-de-lis-laden interior of the Beast’s castle distinctly rococo while Belle’s mother is supposed to have died of the Black Death? Why do some of these costumes look like they could be purchased in a discount Halloween pop-up shop? Less cynical viewers may be able to overlook these flaws, but the lack of care evident in the film’s creation is disappointing.
Not only does the film fail to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor, but it also falls flat in its efforts to update itself for a 2017 audience. The unoriginal new backstories—more dead mothers, an evil father—do little more than stretch the runtime half an hour longer than needed. While the talking household objects were whimsical and cute as 2D cartoons, they are slightly unsettling in CGI: when the candelabra emerges with a human face protruding horror movie-style from his silver arm, it becomes difficult to forget that he and his cohorts are sentient souls deprived of fleshly form.
Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of the film is the fact that it had the potential to be poignant and politically relevant—consider, for instance, how the charismatic villain’s manipulation of the townspeople into a hateful and murderous mob could teach a subtle yet important lesson—but it instead only plays at social awareness. Director Bill Condon boasted that the film features interracial couples and gushed to “Attitude” magazine about some vague “exclusively gay moment.” The sprinkling of a few non-white background characters is always nice, of course, and a step in the right direction, but the inclusion of some non-speaking extras of color and two black actresses who spend most of the movie in raceless CGI form is hardly a victory for racial representation. And the so-called “gay moment,” which garnered controversy both in the U.S. and abroad, is a barely noticeable few frames of two men dancing in a ballroom surrounded by male-female couples.
Disney has no business bragging about its first openly gay character or its first “gay moment.” In fact, “Beauty and the Beast” may do more harm than good for BGLTQ representation, considering its gay character is LeFou (Josh Gad), the villain Gaston’s bumbling sidekick whose name is French for “the fool.” In fact, the decision to make a bad guy gay is far from revolutionary in Disney filmography. From Ursula in “The Little Mermaid” to the effeminate male villains in “The Lion King” and “Aladdin,” the villain characters in its films have often been “queer-coded,” reinforcing the notion that homosexuality is deviant or criminal. “Beauty and the Beast” also falls back on tried-and-true tropes about gayness, as LeFou’s ostensibly painful unrequited love for Gaston is played for cheap laughs. For much of the movie, LeFou is a joke: spineless, sycophantic, the target of slapstick violence and Gaston’s cruelty. The film ends as one might expect, with happy endings for the once-ostracized Belle and the Beast, but the only redemption or resolution LeFou receives is a split-second waltz with a faceless man.
Worse yet, “Vanity Fair” suggested that the choice to portray LeFou as openly gay may have been a “touching tribute” to Howard Ashman, the openly gay lyricist who co-wrote the soundtrack of the original film. Ashman was dying of AIDS as the 1991 film was being produced, and his illness is believed to have influenced the original film’s songs as well as its sympathetic characterization of the Beast, whose curse could be interpreted as a metaphor for the stigma and hopelessness felt by the victims of the AIDS epidemic. There could have been countless ways to incorporate more nuanced gay representation into the film. If Condon and his screenwriters intentionally chose the oafish LeFou to be a tribute to Ashman’s legacy, they made a decision that seems tasteless if not outright disrespectful.
“Beauty and the Beast” has its bright spots, of course, but none are sufficient to outweigh its conspicuous shortcomings. Emma Watson, who is not known for her singing, gave an unexpectedly adequate vocal performance, and a few of the ensemble musical numbers are enjoyable enough, though they obviously fall far short of those in the original. All things considered, “Beauty and the Beast” seems to be a wholly unnecessary remake, a mistake that did not need to be made.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 2, the social scientist Charles Murray, author of the controversial book “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” was set to speak at Middlebury College. In a now-infamous incident, student protesters initially turned their backs to Murray and subsequently shouted him down. When he was escorted into a separate room to complete his interview with the moderator of the event, Middlebury professor Allison Stanger, protesters responded by pulling a fire alarm. Finally, after Stanger and Murray exited the venue, they were attacked by a mob of protesters,  resulting in a neck injury and concussion to Stanger.
We wholeheartedly condemn these acts, especially those that led to violence and physical intimidation, against both the speaker and moderator at the event.
In the wake of this incident, Princeton professor Robert P. George and Harvard professor Cornel West drafted a statement entitled “Truth Seeking, Democracy, and Freedom of Thought and Expression”. The document has accrued over 600 signatories—among them eleven Harvard professors. We support the sentiment of this constructive statement.
In particular, we too affirm that “cultivation and practice of the virtues of intellectual humility, openness of mind, and, above all, love of truth”—which are attained through an openness to opposing viewpoints and free speech—are the premise of a democratic society and a cornerstone to liberal institutions such as Harvard. These are virtues that were evidently lacking at Middlebury College.
Moreover, we believe that institutions of higher learning would do well to strive towards the ideal of discourse and open exchange put forth in this motion; most of all, they must prioritize the pursuit of truth and humility as the informing principles of free speech. All too often, the issue of free speech on college campuses is couched as a butting of heads between students that want to invite potentially controversial speakers merely for the sake of provocation or to “test” that their campus can tolerate speakers with such viewpoints, and closed-minded protesters  that seek to stymie free speech. This statement reminds all parties involved that the pursuit of truth is a collaborative one, and that groups with conflicting ideas should seek to understand rather than simply antagonize each other.
For organizations hosting events, this means publicizing the intellectual contributions they believe their speakers will make to a campus. We hope other students will in turn approach events with an open mind and understand what prospective speakers have to offer. Moreover, when possible, speakers should be held accountable through the possibility of questions from the audience, in order to assure that they too are subject to scrutiny and that their ideas are challenged.
For students who object to speakers’ ideas, we urge an openness to the potential intellectual contributions that those with whom they disagree could make to their communities. Though we support students’ right to protest—it is another cornerstone of a free society—we believe this right should be exercised with utmost caution, and in a civil manner. After all, if students believe that a speaker’s ideas are unequivocally wrong, they would do better to civilly debate the speaker rather than protest violently.
We stand by our previous view that certain speakers have little intellectual contribution to make to college campuses. Indeed, as we said then, not "all speakers are equally worth listening to.” That does not mean they should be shouted down or disinvited. It is difficult to determine which ideas are valid, and drawing such a line is somewhat beside the point of improving the campus climate for exchange of ideas. It is a spirit of collaboration and free exchange that is indispensable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The devastating government inaction that characterized Hurricane Katrina is present in our educational system today. Realizing the vision of equal opportunity requires coordinated action on three fronts: the school, the home, and the community. To deny the severity of the problem in any one of these spheres is a recipe for defeat. One hundred and twenty years after Plessy v. Ferguson and sixty three years after Brown v. Board, schools in America are more separate and unequal than ever. In some zip codes in America, kids can walk safely to and from school. In others they can not. In most zip codes in America, most children have stable, safe homes. In others not.
This triple tragedy is a daily but silent and largely ignored Katrina. It is a catastrophe of unrealized potential.
There are many reasons why this perfect storm of unsafe streets, second-rate schools, and unstable homes gets so little attention from the media and politicians.
The media feeds on the new and the exceptional. This daily Katrina is neither. Politicians focus on voters and money. Kids don’t vote and have little if any money. Put differently, these children are  the collateral damage of the decision to prioritize other things—whether reducing economic inequality, shrinking the government, or fighting climate change. Episodically, leaders of both major parties—from Barack and Michelle Obama to George W. Bush and Mitt Romney—have spoken of this problem, but neither party has given this tragedy the priority it deserves.
What might a three front strategy look like?
The first job of government is to provide physical safety for its citizens. A state that fails to do so is a failed state. In most zip codes in America, children feel safe walking to school, walking to the playground, and walking back home. By contrast, other zip codes are war zones in which parents and children fear for their lives on a daily basis. In these places, the US  is failing.  It is impossible to focus on physics or chemistry if you are worried about being stabbed in the bathroom or being shot on the way home.
There can be no more egregious violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The well-intentioned war on drugs has turned many zip codes into battlefields—just as Prohibition did in the 1920s. If there is one lesson of American history, it is that those years were a mistake, a mistake it took the nation 13 years to reverse. The Second Prohibition has ravaged neighborhoods across America and countries around the world for 45 years. How much longer shall we collectively deny the devastating costs of this failed experiment?
In many zip codes in America, children have great public schools with fabulous academic, arts, and athletics programs, and schools with great teachers, high standards, and high expectations. In others they do not. This is unacceptable. This is not equal protection of the laws. We need a constitutional amendment laying out, in very specific terms, the meaning of equality of schools: rigorous programs across the curriculum; quality of instruction; and academic, athletic, artistic, or behavioral standards.
Education begins at home. The first few years of life are critical to cognitive development. The stability of home life is key to long term social mobility. Family structure matters. This is the clear message of research from the left, right, and center: from Kathy Edin, Robert Putnam, and scholars at the Brookings Institution to Charles Murray, Heather MacDonald, and researchers at the American Enterprise Institute. The economic, cultural, and political causes of the disintegration of the American family must be acknowledged and addressed. We need legislation that reduces the economic incentives for unready parenthood and promotes parenthood education, including abstinence, and that provides universal access to all reproductive serves, including Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives, which have been shown to drastically reduce unwanted pregnancies.
A three front war needs a three front strategy. We need to stop denying that the war on drugs is an abysmal failure. We need to stop pretending that Brown v. Board fixed educational inequality. We need to stop sweeping the family structure crisis under the rug.

Andi Mack, the new serialized Asian-American TV show, conceptualized by the white woman behind “Lizzy McGuire”, is airing on Disney Channel. That sentence sat strange with me too. The premise: you’re thirteen and waiting for your first period. You’re in love with eighth-grade Jonah Beck from the ultimate Frisbee team. Your shack is detached from your house. You have a yellow mom and a white dad. You bought an electric bicycle behind your mom’s back, but your very old, very cool sister named Bex has a motorcycle. Then Bex tells you she’s actually your mom. Which means your mom is actually your grandma. Which means America’s new teen mother is yellow, suburban, and rich.
I was also surprised by the show’s novelty (the Sausage Party phenomenon—what’s with people making mature videos with Hannah Montana aesthetics) and if novelty was the only thing that made the show unique. Each actor described the show as “real” which made it different from the rest. I was more surprised because real was ambiguous and America never coddled her teen moms. They were always poor whites, Midwesterners, dumb, hood rats, victims, coerced, bitter, mamis, welfare queens, golddiggers, abandoned. They were exceptions, which was the opposite of real, and never given the luxury to speak for their experiences without a filter, without being framed as the example or counterexample.
Bex is a half Asian girl with style and Polaroids of her boyfriends, plural. Bex is not an exception. Most yellow women in today’s media, regardless of their youth, are marketed as a hipster’s favorite accessory. Margaret Cho, the first Asian American TV show star, is 47 years old, well into her mid-age, sang “My Puss” in a Chinese accent before Awkwafina sang “My Vag” in her Brooklyn backyard. Amy Tan has mentioned her German high school boyfriend who played the guitar. Asian beauty gurus like Sophia Chang and Jennifer Im dominate the blogosphere. Jenny Zhang writes about Shakespeare & Co and blow jobs in eighth grade; Constance Wu writes angry posts about The Great Wall and Casey Affleck. None of the above women have children. Yellow girls write poetry, talk liberal, and dress well. We abort at a rate two times that of white women. While we are always placed under the context of an overbearing mother and the consequent repression that hobbles over, we are never understood as mothers or potential mothers ourselves. We have the means of providing but are not providers. We live as teens, easy, hormonal, trendy. The slight mutation of Bex’s image from cool girl to teen mom is an inversion of the formula many of us understand to be a yellow girl’s past and destiny, albeit self-consciously socially constructed. But what does that mean?
None of us looked up to our mother, but we should have. The era was before 1080p so expressions of race revolved around bad quality YouTube videos, where someone’s Asian mom did things that our moms either did or did not do. Amy Chua exposed our secrets, and our pretty-bad-fully-yellow-school-orchestra’s concertmaster called it the best book ever, two months before he moved off to Pennsylvania, and a year before I quit. My mother wore high heels, worked in Manhattan, dressed in color, and read Bernard Shaw, but the truth was, I knew my becoming in this country would be foreign to her, and my style, when it was done, would be unrecognizable, since America dictated my life and her script was made in China. We didn’t trust our mother figures as role models but that didn’t mean there weren’t any, and I knew if I was going to be pretty, I was going to be wild.
The new girl from Oregon got sex advice from her older sister who yes, went to a strip club and liked it, and also yes, kissed a girl and liked it, and finally yes, had an open relationship with this British guy, who, yeah, had an accent. The girl from my Saturday relativity class told me her ex-boyfriend’s mom gave her condoms that she never used since they didn’t feel good. The viral video about putting on a tampon complete with a diagram of the vagina was done by an Asian girl with heavy eyeliner. Margaret Cho wasn’t the skinniest, but she was still getting it, at age over thirty. These girls were trendy, on the Ivy League track, and aspiring young business professionals, which was the most appealing version of yellow American womanhood that I could find, and bonus, it was easily accessible. Most of everything, their antics, their choices, their escapades, were presented to me well-done, with a shrug, and zero complications. I thought their images were real because their lives were messy and fun, but that was before I realized the messy fun Asian girl was also a trope, a mask. The realization that some of us couldn’t be polygamous, that there was dramatic upkeep involved with pink hair, that some of us turned red after x amount of drinks, was a similar feeling to the moment when my doctor, a black woman, lectured me about low key believing people of color were immune to skin cancer. I knew the ease had to be fake. I just didn’t think its fakeness applied to me.
I find Bex compelling because she fit the trope of a girl growing up yellow, suburban, and rich fast, but the illusion of ease didn’t last past the first episode, and in that case the representation qualifies as real. In a reality where 35% of Asian American pregnancies result in abortion, where Asian American women are four times more likely to contract STDs than their male counterparts, where Asian American women have the largest annual percent increase of 14.3% in HIV rates of any ethnic group, it is important that issues of sexual health, directly related to gendered and raced performance, are addressed. I hope Bex provides a sober representation of a highly seductive trope by highlighting precaution over romance, education over fantasy. No one is the exception. And your style is never your shield.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Visitors to Lamont Library were greeted this week by an unfamiliar sight: a large poster of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana now adorns the library’s foyer, reading “Dean Khurana drinks tap water. You should too.”
The poster, one of several posted around campus, is part of a “Tap Water Campaign” organized by Green ’20, the College’s freshman sustainability think tank.
Campus figures like Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, and Economics 10: "Principles of Economics" professor N. Gregory Mankiw also have appeared in the campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the energy costs of producing bottled water, the environmental impacts of the plastic in water bottles, and the safety of Cambridge's tap water.
In addition to the physical flyers, the Office of Sustainability’s Facebook page posted videos and photos endorsing the campaign. The campaign follows an October survey from Green ’20, which found that while 68 percent of students drink tap water at home, only 45 percent drink it on campus. Green ’20’s website says tap water is “safe, free, and green,” and that students should know bottled water is no safer.
Beverly Ge ’20, a member of Green ’20, said correcting misinformation about drinking water was central to the campaign.
“I think a lot of people are also confused about the difference between the water bottle filling stations [and tap water]. Those are not any more filtered, necessarily. They are just colder so it tastes better,” she said. “I know that some people are kind of grossed out because when they turn on the tap [the water] is a little murky. It’s not murky because of dirt or anything in there. It has to do mostly with the oxygen content of tap water.”
Ge said the campaign is part of a larger effort to get students to think about resource usage and the environment.
“As with many sustainability and lifestyle-related things, it’s all about developing habits and developing awareness. One of our main goals is to get people to think a little more about this very important resource that all of us have to consume and where it comes from,” Ge said. “I think just being cognizant of those things, and being more in touch with the environment around us, will lead to better and more sustainable lifestyle practices in everyday life.”
Green ’20 is composed of nine members of the Class of 2020. Theodora T. Mautz ’19, sophomore advisor to the group, describes it as an “inclusive think tank” that works on sustainability campaigns on campus.
“Involved students get to choose campaigns and projects that interest them and that can effect positive changes on campus. The compost bins in freshman dorms are an example of past Green think tank projects,” she said.

Harvard alumnus and business baron David Rockefeller ’36, who donated generously to several Harvard initiatives and for whom a center for Latin American studies was dedicated, passed away Monday. He was 101.
A member of the famed Rockefeller family—an international business dynasty—his influence stretched around the globe; he visited at least 103 different countries during his time at Chase Bank.
Harvard, where Rockefeller spent his undergraduate career living in Eliot House and later served as president of the University’s second-highest governing body, was the beneficiary of at least $140 million dollars in gifts from Rockefeller, making him one of Harvard’s most generous supporters.
In a statement shortly after Rockefeller’s death, University President Drew G. Faust hailed Rockefeller as “a visionary leader, an extraordinary philanthropist, and a devoted friend,” and dwelled on the billionaire’s expansive contributions—both monetarily and in service—to Harvard.
“His passion for Harvard was infectious, and his commitment to the arts, to experiential learning, and to increasing knowledge of other cultures has made a lasting impact on the University and the thousands of students and scholars who have benefited from his generosity,” Faust wrote.
The summer after his freshman year at the College, Rockefeller studied abroad in Germany. The year was 1933, and he witnessed the rise of fascism there firsthand. He felt strongly about giving students the opportunity to go abroad, something he believed would enrich the undergraduate experience.
In 2006, Rockefeller was on the cusp of donating $75 million to Harvard’s Center for Latin American Studies—which he had established with a $25 million donation in 1994—but withheld the donation after then-University president Lawrence H. Summers resigned. In 2008, Rockefeller made a $100 million gift, then the largest one-time alumni gift in Harvard’s history, to bolster aid for students studying abroad and to support the renovation of the Harvard Art Museums.
While Rockefeller, previously the oldest billionaire in the world, is widely known for his business and philanthropic acumen, he was also a “somewhat shy naturalist” who nearly always had a small insect jar with him while traveling, according to Professor Brian D. Farrell, who directs of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American studies.
“Another biography of David was written in tiny little letters on the labels underneath the insects that he collected since he was seven years old,” Farrell mused. “I was really stunned by how thoroughly he knew insect classification. He recognized everything—really quite remarkable for anyone.”
According to Farrell, Rockefeller’s collection of over 150,000 specimens representing 10,000 species will be donated to the University sometime in the next year.
Farrell remembered Rockefeller as a “very gentle and courteous man.”
“He was really a model in a way,” Farrell said. “He’s this kind of fellow who makes everyone feel comfortable in his presence. Very low key and thoughtful. Not at all brash, not at all entitled feeling. Just a very modest character, and I think that was a family trait.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Faculty Council punted on a motion challenging the College’s proposed enforcement of penalties on members of single-gender social groups at its biweekly meeting Wednesday.
Instead of voting in favor of or against the motion, the Council recommended the motion instead be taken up by another committee tasked with deciding whether the entire policy should be “revised or replaced.”
Biology professor David A. Haig—who sits on the committee considering replacing the policy—presented the motion to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' highest elected body its biweekly meeting on Wednesday. The motion takes issue with a proposed requirement that students sign a document affirming they do not belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization before applying for leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, or fellowships.
While the Faculty Council recommends the direction it thinks legislation should take, its decisions are not binding. Haig’s motion will be on the docket for discussion at the next Faculty meeting on April 4, and may come to a vote in a later meeting.
Haig announced his motion last week as a guest post on the personal blog of former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, a vocal critic of the policy who had previously submitted a motion opposing it.
The requirement Haig said he takes issue with is one of the recommendations included in a March 6 report by a committee tasked with advising how to enforce the College’s penalties on members of final clubs and Greek organizations. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted nearly all of the report's recommendations earlier this month.
“The laudable aim of gender-inclusivity has metamorphosed into a proposal that students seeking certain awards or offices are required to affirm that they are in compliance with ‘the College’s policy regarding the principle of non-discrimination, particularly with regard to membership in unrecognized single-gender social organizations,’” Haig wrote in the blog post. “I consider the requirement for such an affirmation to be a dangerous precedent."
Faculty Council member and Japanese history professor David L. Howell said he felt the motion was “premature,” given that there is now a committee tasked with considering the types of questions the motion raises.
“We understood the concerns behind the motion, but because there is this new committee that will be considering the implementation committee report, and also the policy itself, it seemed that that would be the proper place to have the discussions at this point,” he said.
Howell added that if there were still concerns after the committee’s work, Haig could then submit another motion.
Haig’s motion is the second piece of Faculty legislation to oppose the sanctions. Shortly after Khurana announced the policy in May 2016, Lewis filed a motion stating that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
After heated debate at several Faculty meetings, Lewis withdrew the motion following the announcement of the faculty committee in January.

The International Scholars Working Group, part of Harvard’s Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, held a teach-in on Islamophobia Thursday evening that looked to educate members about “the history of Islamophobia in the U.S. and current issues facing Muslim communities,” according to the group’s Facebook page.
Anwar Omeish ’19, a member of an undergraduate student group called the Anti-Islamophobia Network, led the teach-in, discussing discrimination against Muslims. Omeish said that recent attacks on Muslims by activists, media outlets, and think tanks have fed a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment.
“I used to say it was impossible to be an active Muslim-American and not be controversial,” she said. “That’s what we’re seeing now.”
Jake T. Gable, a member of the International Scholars Working Group and the teach-in’s organizer, said he arranged the event to learn about an important issue from another campus organization.
“We wanted to organize this event...to begin to cultivate cross-campus and cross-group connections and promote that outreach with each other,” he said.
Omeish also described surveillance, incarceration, and immigration programs that she said targeted Muslims, calling them discriminatory and prejudicial.
“These policies not only are messed up and target people based on their identities, but also don’t work,” she said. “They are not the best way to fight terrorism. And they often trigger anger or resentment against the government.”
Gable said that the event provided “an opportunity for grad students to become more informed on issues impacting international students and international scholars” and to hear from students with "different perspectives."
Marena Lin, a member of the International Scholars Working Group, said international students should learn about the prejudice that Muslims face, since they may experience similar discrimination in the future.
“The kind of federal targeting that has been happening to the Muslim community now has played itself out in history to other groups in very much the same way and understanding how this is institutionalized...is very important for other groups that might be affected by the same things,” she said.
Omeish said the Anti-Islamophobia Network would try to involve members of the International Scholars Working Group in its upcoming activism efforts, adding that she considers the ISWG “as an allied group.”
“It’s definitely important for us to be doing that cross-education,” Omeish said.
The teach-in comes one month after the International Scholars Working Group delivered a petition to University president Drew G. Faust, protesting Harvard’s response to President Donald J. Trump’s first travel ban.

School of Public Health professor Marcia C. de Castro presented preliminary research on Wednesday that found that birth rates in Latin America have not fallen in the months following the Zika epidemic.
The seminar, hosted by the Brazil Studies Seminar Series and called “Impact of the Zika Virus Outbreak on Brazilian Fertility,” looked at abortion, historical birth rates, access to contraceptives, and the spread of the virus itself to show why birth rates failed to fall, despite the known risk of having a child while infected with the virus.
Castro attributed the constant birth rate to ineffectiveness in Brazil’s birth control program. Although 87 percent of women have access to contraception, a high rate of contraceptive misuse means that 40 percent of Brazilian pregnancies are unwanted, Castro claimed.
“To have a decline in the unwanted pregnancy, that means that women should have control of it in the first place. Access to contraception doesn’t seem to be the problem. Using it correctly is still a problem in Brazil,” Castro said.
She adds that Zika is often asymptomatic. “We have several records of women who delivered babies with congenital Zika syndrome and they never had symptoms during pregnancy,” Castro said.
Castro also shared developments showing that the Zika virus can have a diverse range of effects—beyond microcephaly, which causes babies to have smaller heads—on fetuses. Many children thought to be healthy at birth were later discovered to have Zika-based impairments. According to Castro, 20 percent of children with brain damage had “perfectly normal head sizes.”
Instead of trying to lower birth rates, Castro argued that the Brazilian government might reduce incidence of Zika by improving infrastructure to reduce standing water. She cited one survey showing that 85 percent of mosquito breeding habitats are domestic water containers.
However, while Castro found the Brazilian government’s infrastructure improvements to be virtually non-existent, some attendees were still impressed by her description of how the government tried to combat Zika.
“All the information they gave, all the help they gave to women, to everyone...dealing with the problem.” said Patricia C. McCormick, a seminar attendee. “It’s amazing. Hats off.”
While Zika transmission rates have fallen, Castro emphasized that the virus was down but not out.

Health officials from Harvard University Health Services, the Cambridge Public Health Department, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health are identifying residents potentially exposed to tuberculosis in Mather House, noting that a resident may have come down with the disease.
In an email sent to Mather residents Wednesday night,HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira wrote that HUHS or the Cambridge Public Health Department will notify residents who may have been exposed to tuberculosis, a contagious bacterial disease. 
While health officials work to determine whether the resident does indeed have tuberculosis— a process that could take up to 60 days— the individual will undergo treatment.
“In adherence with state law, the individual is receiving treatment and following precautions, as directed by the Cambridge Public Health Department, as if she/he were a confirmed case.” Barreira wrote in an emailed statement. “Upon completion of the 14-day treatment, individuals with active TB are no longer considered contagious.”
Although tuberculosis is spread airborne, Barreira’s email stressed that the disease is not highly contagious and “generally requires prolonged or intense exposure by an infectious person to transmit the infection to others.” One cannot spread it by “sharing food, shaking hands, or touching clothing or linens,” according to Barreira.
According to Cambridge Public Health Department Public Information Officer Susan Feinberg, Cambridge had an average of six confirmed tuberculosis cases per year from 2012 to 2016. Last year, the department confirmed three active cases.
Many Mather House residents said they were unconcerned about the investigation.
“It sounded like it was contained, and the one isolated case was isolated,” said Trevor A. Mullin ’17, a student in Mather.
Joshua B. Rapperport ’17, another Mather resident, said that he would not be taking extra precautions against getting sick.
“Everyone got scared about mumps. I had mumps early on, it wasn’t a big deal. I tend to think people overreact about sickness,” Rapperport said, adding,  “Unless there’s actually a disease that was going to kill people, I wouldn’t really ever worry about getting sick, just because you’re going to get sick and there’s probably not anything you can do to avoid it if you’re going to get sick. So if there’s tuberculosis in Mather, what it is is what it is.”
Last spring, more than 60 Harvard affiliates contracted mumps. As the disease spread throughout campus, HUHS quarantined some infected students.
Barreira said that as of Thursday, there were “no other suspect cases of tuberculosis at Harvard, and no one else seen at Harvard University Health Services has been identified as having symptoms consistent with TB.”

The Undergraduate Council will be more involved in the process for recognizing new student organizations, according to a draft policy unveiled at a Committee on Student Life meeting Thursday.
Under the proposed revisions, the UC will be tasked with recommending clubs for approval to the Committee on Student Life, a student-faculty committee that includes UC representatives, House Faculty Deans, and administrators from the Office of Student Life.
Following unanimous support from CSL members, the UC will vote to approve the policy at its next general meeting on Sunday. While the CSL will continue to have the ultimate power to approve new student groups, the UC will have a significantly expanded role in the process should they adopt the proposal.
The UC’s recommendations for recognition will incorporate feedback in a multi-step process. College staff from offices including the Women’s Center, Phillips Brooks House Association, and the Office for the Arts will meet with prospective club leaders to advise them on resources and potential “risks.” Afterwards, a UC committee will interview prospective club leaders before the full UC votes on recommendations for the CSL.
This past semester, the Office of Student Life chose to not accept new applications for student organizations after the CSL suggested a halt to new submissions. The committee sought to revise the process for approval to limit the number of “superfluous” groups due to the limited nature of financial and physical campus resources.
In an effort to curb the rapid proliferation of campus clubs, the draft policy also creates a new one-year “provisional” status for all prospective clubs who seek formal recognition from the College. Subsequent review by the Undergraduate Council will be required before granting student organizations full recognition. Recognition from the College allows student groups to access privileges such as the ability to reserve campus spaces and eligibility for UC grant money.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, who co-chairs the CSL, said that the UC’s potential role in determining which prospective student groups are recognized aligns with their current responsibilities of allocating grant funds to clubs.
“We really want more student involvement,” Sachee said. “That’s what it’s really about—giving students more voice in what they do on this campus and how they spend their time.”
Rebecca J. Ramos ’17, a CSL member and former Cabot House Committee co-chair, believes that the new policy will mostly help new organizations.
“I think this proposal will do a lot in terms of setting organizations up for success,” Ramos said. “I’ve been involved in many clubs and I think that this proposal will help new organizations really get their footing before launching some of their bigger projects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After the federal government announced it would suspend fast-track processing for H-1B visas, Harvard administrators are scrambling to process visas for some scholars and warn that the suspension could have “serious effects” on faculty hiring.
At the beginning of March, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it will no longer offer premium processing for the non-immigration visas—which allow employers to temporarily hire high-skilled workers—for up to six months beginning April 3.
Maureen Martin, director of immigration services at the Harvard International Office, said her office files between 150 and 200 H-1B visas each year through premium processing, which allows employers to pay a fee to expedite visa acquisition to 15 days. The bulk of these visas go to faculty members.
While Harvard has spent the last two months forcefully opposing President Donald Trump’s immigration orders, this more subtle bureaucratic change may similarly jeopardize the mobility and employment of scores of Harvard affiliates.
In an email to international affiliates and departments, HIO warned academic departments that the suspension of premium processing might delay the hiring of employees on H-1B visas.
“If your department plans to hire faculty or researchers on H-1B visas for July 1 or for the new Fall semester start date, please know that this suspension may affect our ability to obtain timely visa sponsorship,” the email reads. “We strongly suggest that your department discuss all outstanding hires and determine if this action may affect your hiring plans.”
According to the March 3 USCIS announcement, the upcoming suspension is intended to allow the agency to reduce the backlog of applications to “help us to reduce overall H-1B processing times.”
At a Faculty meeting earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust told faculty members she is “very concerned” about the suspension of premium processing.
“This change in policy could have serious effects on the University’s ability to bring international researchers and faculty to campus in a timely manner,” she said. “The thousands of individuals who come to our campus from around the globe each year are essential to who we are and what we do."
Without premium processing, visa applications can take months for USCIS to process. For new hires, this waiting period could delay their ability to travel to the United States by a designated start date. And scholars already at Harvard looking to renew their visas will be allowed to remain in the country while their documents are being processed, though they will not be able to work after a grace period of 240 days or travel internationally.
The USCIS announcement left the HIO less than a month to file as many H-1B applications for premium processing as possible before the April 3 deadline. The process, which requires departments to submit information and fees to the HIO, typically takes two to three months. Only one person in the HIO works exclusively on faculty cases.
The HIO has filed more than 80 applications since the USCIS announced the procedural change, according to Martin, who said the office will continue to file even after the suspension takes effect on April 3.
English Department chair W. James Simpson wrote in an email that the change has delayed hiring in the department.
“The suspension of premium processing is holding up potential hires: we are unable to guarantee to a potential hire now that their start date will be September,” Simpson wrote.
Science departments in FAS, the School of Public Health, and the Medical School have a higher proportion of H-1B holders, according to the HIO.
Christian Suharlim, President of the Postdoctoral Association at the School of Public Health, said that many researchers at the school are international and rely on the H-1B visa. Suharlim is one such researcher, and without premium processing, he will be unable to travel while the USCIS reviews his documents.
“My work is on low- and middle-income countries, so I need the international travel and I do a lot of teaching internationally as well,” Suharlim said.
Medical School professor Thomas Michel said H-1B holders work in labs at the Medical School and at Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The USCIS suspension could impact research across the Boston area, he said.
The Association of American Universities, of which Harvard is a member, wrote a letter to Lori Scialabba, acting director of USCIS, arguing the suspension of premium processing would hinder universities’ efforts to hire professors and researchers from abroad.
“Without the option for premium processing, many universities currently in the midst of hiring negotiations will not be able to have their international employees begin work until mid-semester at best, potentially leaving classes stranded without professors,” the letter reads.
Several scholars on H-1B visas declined to comment for this article, citing fears that doing so might jeopardize their chances of visa renewal.

Will Zhang, a first year Harvard Law School student, died Thursday, according to an email from Law School Dean Martha L. Minow.
At press time, the cause of death was unknown. Elizabeth Vlock, a spokesperson for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office, said the death “is not considered suspicious.” Minow wrote in her email that the “circumstances of Will’s death have not been fully determined.”
 “This is an exceptionally difficult time for those who knew Will, especially his family and friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of them,” Minow wrote. “I ask that you each offer comfort to those around you who may be grieving or in distress and need a shoulder to lean on.”
According Zhang’s LinkedIn profile, he graduated from the University of Toronto in 2016.  Zhang was a member of the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association at the Law School, according to the organization’s co-presidents Amanda Chan and Kevin W. Jiang.
More than 50 people attended a session the Dean of Students’ Office held for students to reflect on the news. Additionally, Minow’s email provided a number of resources for student coping with grief. Minow wrote that the school would be looking for ways to commemorate Zhang.
“This is a time for each of us to cherish our community and to offer caring and consolation,” Minow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gut wrenching. A heartbreaker. Devastating.
These were the words Harvard coach Tommy Amaker used to describe his team’s early exit from the inaugural Ivy League conference tournament almost two weeks ago when third-seeded Yale defeated second-seeded Harvard, 73-71.
For the fifth time in Ivy play, the Crimson fell in the final moments of the game. But remember, Harvard had only five losses against Ancient Eight opponents (four in the regular season, and the Ivy Tournament first round loss). In those five losses, the margin of defeat was a combined total of 13 points.
For comparison, in the second half of conference play, every Ivy team, except Harvard, lost to Princeton by more than 13 points in just one game.
But for the Crimson, every loss came down to the waning plays—in three of those games, it came down to the final six seconds.
The team’s largest gap in an Ivy loss was four points to the Tigers in the last weekend of regular season play, and two points of the final difference came on Princeton free throws as the Crimson tried to extend the game when it fell behind by two on an Amir Bell floater.
After each of these losses, myself and my fellow Crimson reporters were tasked with interviewing coach Amaker and an array of players, trying to dissect what had just happened on the court.
In no circumstance was this more challenging than the Ivy Tournament, as seniors Siyani Chambers and Zena Edosomwan had to discuss the loss to the Bulldogs just moments after their collegiate basketball careers had ended.
But despite the pain of the season ending in such devastating fashion, neither hesitated to speak of the future of Harvard basketball. While the tandem and their fellow classmates are some of the last remaining ties to the Crimson’s peak—being the only players on the roster for Harvard’s NCAA Tournament victories against New Mexico and Cincinnati—the program is taking steps forward to be in contention for March Madness for years to come.
“Time obviously flies and it’s been a privilege to play for coach Amaker and be a student-athlete at Harvard University and compete in the Ivy League,” Edosomwan said. “It’s such a tough league. I’m really proud of this program and the direction it’s going.”
This isn’t to minimize the losses of Chambers and Edosomwan. While both have made significant impacts on the court, their leadership has been something that Amaker has pointed to time and time again before every big game.
The story of the 2016-2017 season was Harvard’s revered freshman class—a top-ten recruiting class, an eventual Ivy League Rookie of the Year in guard Bryce Aiken, and an finalized starting roster that included four rookies and Chambers. With the 10th youngest team in the NCAA according to KenPom ratings, however, Amaker relied on his veterans to be vocal on and off the court to guide the underclassmen through the transition to college basketball.
But, for the first time since the 2014-2015 season, Amaker won’t have the significant hurdle next season of working with a core of brand new players. The Crimson currently has three recruits set to join the squad in 2017, but it returns 73 percent of its points and 87 percent of its minutes from this season.
Thirteen of its 20 players on the current roster are freshmen and sophomores.
In each of the past two years, Amaker has played at least two freshmen in every starting lineup.
Though we can’t yet know for sure who will get the nod next season, the team will have an easier time hitting the ground running with four returning starters in Aiken, Seth Towns, Chris Lewis, and Justin Bassey.
“This young group, they have the potential to be special, but it’s going to take a lot, as I’m sure they recognize more now than they did a year ago,” Amaker said.
In Aiken, we saw the possibilities already this season. From his first game—in which he scored 21 points against Stanford in the Pac-12 China Game—the spark he provided in the backcourt was immediately evident.
While there were ups and downs throughout the year, Aiken was the main reason why the Harvard-Yale Ivy Tournament battle was close. The rookie scored 28 points (20 of which came in the second half). But without Chambers next season, Aiken will need to adjust his game in order to maintain the level of production that he saw this season.
With Chambers at the helm, Aiken could focus on creating his shot while Chambers took on more of the “quarterback” role as Amaker describes it. Without Chambers, Aiken will have to blend the two roles more cohesively.
“Going forward, it’s going to be the impact he can have on other players, not just the impact he can have on himself,” Amaker said. “It’s going to really separate him and allow him to really grow and develop, and ultimately push us to the victory circle.”
But as his performance in the Ivy Tournament showed, Aiken has serious leadership potential.
Aiken led the team in scoring, but Seth Towns was right behind him. Notching 12.3 points per game, Towns was effective all over the offensive end of the floor. The Columbus, Ohio native shot just under 40 percent from behind the arc and 43 percent overall, posing a matchup problem for defenses as he stands at 6’5’’.
Improved defense will be the key for Towns as he found himself fluctuating from being a wing to being the second big man on the floor, tasked with guarding different types of players depending on who he was with on the floor now that Edosomwan will be gone.
The highest ranked prospect of the rookie class coming into the year was Chris Lewis, and though at times he certainly reminded crowds that he was a rookie, he excelled offensively in being consistent around the rim, finishing the year with the highest field goal percentage in the Ancient Eight at 65.2 percent. Lewis couldn’t keep up with Edosomwan in the rebound category, but he certainly is farther along than Edosomwan was as a rookie, making the team optimistic for elevated performance during his maturation process.
Justin Bassey didn’t get the accolades of Aiken, Towns, and Lewis, but he was a force for the Crimson in the second half of the season and was a key defensive presence down the stretch, typically tasked with guarding the opposing team’s best perimeter player. Though he averaged just 18 minutes per game in the heart of the nonconference schedule in December, Bassey notched over 30 minutes a game in February and March with the season on the line.
Since I began covering the team in the spring of 2015, each season has ended with more question marks than answers.
How will Harvard rebound from the graduation of Wesley Saunders?
Will Siyani Chambers be able to return to full strength following an ACL tear?
Can the freshmen live up to expectations?
While there are no certainties about the 2017-2018 campaign just yet, the way the 2016-2017 season ended in such devastating fashion has not diminished the positive tone that the Crimson takes going into the offseason.
“I think there’s an amazing amount of optimism and anticipation for one year, next year,” Amaker said. “I think we feel like we’re in a place where there’s an amazing amount of forward thinking and optimism and belief that the good days are still ahead of us...maybe even our best days could be ahead of us. That’s saying a lot given what some of our past days have been. But I do think that it’s fair to think like that and to hope for that and certainly that’s the feeling we have around our program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The collection of Crimson skaters that assembled under the leadership of Coach Billy Cleary ’56 in 1988-1989 has always represented the gold standard for Harvard Hockey. That club cemented its place in the record books as the only group of Crimson icemen to string together 15 wins in a row, win 30 games in a season, and bring home a national championship.
Twenty-eight years later, the word “only” is on the verge of vanishing—perhaps on all three fronts.
Unbeaten since Jan. 17, this year’s Harvard men’s hockey team stands just one win shy of matching the 1989 team’s 15-game winning streak. And with 26 wins already under its belt, the Crimson could hit 30 victories with a perfect run through the Big Dance.
However, in order to share any of these pedestals with the boys of ’89, No. 2 Harvard (26-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) first must do something it has accomplished just once since its national championship run: win an NCAA tournament game.
Five years after being crowned the king of college hockey, a new-look Crimson unit topped New Hampshire in its first game of the 1994 NCAA tournament by a convincing 7-1 margin. But after Harvard fell to Lake Superior State in the semifinals one game later, an era came to a close. The Crimson has since missed the tournament 15 times; and when it has cracked the field, it’s suffered seven straight first-round exits.
Current head coach Ted Donato ’91, a sophomore on the 1989 team, has been at the helm for the last four one-and-dones. Donato brought Harvard to the tournament in 2005 and 2006—his first two seasons behind the bench—and returned in 2015 and 2016 after a nine-year absense. But the skipper is still in search of win number one.
“I think it’s really difficult when you look at it,” Donato said. “One game elimination—it’s a challenge, especially when you get different teams that maybe you haven’t seen and you don’t really have a handle on exactly. But it’s the same challenge for everybody.”
In each of the last two seasons, the Crimson entered the tournament as a three-seed up against a two-seed in the opening round. Therefore, Harvard’s losses to Nebraska-Omaha and Boston College by identical 4-1 margins in 2015 and 2016, respectively, weren’t necessarily shocking results. But this year, the Crimson will be fighting off the ghosts of tournaments past as a favorite—a bit of a paradox for the top seed in Providence’s East Regional.
Nonetheless, this battle-tested Harvard team has grown more than accustomed to ending droughts. Over the course of the current campaign, the Crimson has captured its first outright Ivy League title in 11 years, its first regular-season ECAC crown in 23 years, and its first Beanpot in 24 years.
Yet, unless Harvard can bring an end to one more skid—a stretch of about two dozen seasons without an NCAA tournament win—the Crimson’s outstanding 2016-2017 campaign could come to an end Friday evening. And to no one’s surprise, co-captain Devin Tringale said the team would “definitely be disappointed with that outcome.”
“I think by our measures, we would count it as a successful year but a year that wasn’t good enough,” Tringale said. “We’re really proud of all our accomplishments we’ve had so far, but our eyes are on a higher prize right now.”
Much of Harvard’s success to date is owed to veterans such as Tringale. The Crimson carries the highest-scoring senior class in the nation, and junior Merrick Madsen has put together the winningest season for a Harvard netminder in program history.
Having played in two tournament games already, these veterans now have a chance to utilize their experience to contribute beyond the stat sheet. Madsen, a backup when this group first reached the tournament in 2015, addressed how the Crimson’s prior experience in the Dance should aid the team’s cause in Providence.
“Tournament hockey, it’s a whole different atmosphere,” Madsen said. “Just us even going and living the experience that is the tournament, I think it’s good because we can go and know what we’re getting into…. I think it’ll help us settle in a lot more than in past years.”
“I remember my first year, we were all like, ‘This is so cool, This is awesome,’ and all that stuff,” he added. “And it’s great, you can get into that a little bit. But you’ve got to remember you’re there to win games too. The fact that this is our third year in a row, I think a lot of the guys will be like, ‘We’re just back at it.’”
Senior Sean Malone shared a similar opinion, saying that whereas Harvard played “timid” in 2015 against UNO—a team it hadn’t seen before—the Crimson this time expects to stick with exactly what’s gotten it to the tournament in the first place.
That sounds like good news for Harvard, considering its timid play two years ago may have been what led to the Crimson falling behind UNO early—a mistake repeated against BC in 2016, but one which co-captain Alexander Kerfoot hopes to avoid Friday.
“It’s really hard in one-and-done situations when you’re chasing games, so we’re going to look to get the first goal and play from ahead,” Kerfoot said.
Kerfoot and company will aim to do that against Providence, a four-seed playing less than three miles away from their home rink.
“We love being the underdog,’’ Friars goalie Hayden Hawkey told The Providence Journal. “Everyone is kind of sleeping on us right now. That’s big for us. We know what we’ve got in the room.”
“They can think whatever they want,” Kerfoot responded. “We’re fine playing the underdog [or] the favorite. We’re just going in there and trying to treat it like any other hockey game. And we’re going to be ready for it.”
