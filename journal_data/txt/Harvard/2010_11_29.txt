After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what has become nothing short of an Internet sensation over the past week, a professor at Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration proved especially short-fused when a student audibly yawned during his class. Demanding that the student identify himself or herself, the professor further raised his voice when no one came forward, asking why the student would not just “get up and walk the hell out.”
Indeed, we believe that students and professors alike deserve a certain base level of respect, and yawning conspicuously during class is certainly a breach of this respect. But although the professor’s inclination to get upset may have been understandable, his reaction was excessively and inappropriately harsh. To his credit, the professor and the dean of the school later apologized for the professor’s reaction—a necessary acknowledgement of unpaid respect. Still, the situation should never have escalated as it did.
College students are of the age where they should know how to comport themselves in public. Accordingly, college professors should expect only minimal interruptions during class, and a loud and perceptible yawn is certainly disruptive and disrespectful. Yawning may be involuntary, but tempering a yawn is something that students should attempt to do regardless of their level of exhaustion, simply out of respect for their professor and for other students in the class.
Still, even with the level of disrespect shown, it was highly inappropriate for the professor in this instance to use any language that was abusive or disrespectful in turn. Professors should never exhibit such derisive behavior toward their students, regardless of their level of anger or annoyance. There are better ways of handling such situations that do not make either party feel slighted or marginalized. Professors should be wary of how they react, even when they are upset.
In this case, the professor’s insistence on finding out who specifically had yawned was especially inappropriate. Despite the fact that the student was never identified, it was improper for the professor to attempt to single him or her out for a matter that was so trivial and that ought to have been overlooked via a more gracious response from the professor.
Of course, we should not jump to such quick conclusions without considering the circumstances that could have driven the professor to react in such a manner. In a video of the incident, the professor mentioned that this was not the first time something like this had happened; given that we are not aware of this situation’s full context, it could have been that the professor had given due warnings in the past and that this was the last straw. But, barring any extreme precedent set for this outburst, it seems the professor was certainly in the wrong.
Finally, we note the tremendous irony in the incident’s location—Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration, an institution that prides itself on being a leader in hospitality management. In a place where teaching hospitality is paramount, we can only hope that this professor’s actions are inconsistent with his teachings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A favorite study place for many Harvard students, Lamont Library is especially convenient because of its 24-hour availability throughout most of the week. That Lamont is open 24/5 is due to the extension of a 2005 pilot project; when the all-day, all-night schedule was made permanent, overjoyed students celebrated the occasion. Late Friday and Saturday studiers, however, were left out of the fun.
On those days, students are still shooed away at a measly 9:45 p.m. to search for a quiet place to study. Though Friday and Saturday are for some students a time for respite and partying, for a great many others it is the beginning of a productive weekend. Midterms are not always in the middle of the term, assignments are often due on Mondays, and a need for a quiet place to study can extend into the weekend. In recognition of the thousands of  varying academic schedules and personal study habits of undergraduates, Lamont should extend its Friday and Saturday hours to at least 1:00 a.m.
Even on Friday and Saturday nights, constant availability of quiet study space is important at a place like Harvard. Not all undergraduates want or need to study on Friday and Saturday nights, and this is good for them; however, their fun often interrupts the quiet diligence of their unfortunately tasked peers. The sounds of late-night festivities bleed through Harvard’s paper-thin dorm walls, and, I am told, even infiltrate into House libraries; although some of these libraries are open 24/7, they are embedded within the Houses. Indeed, is there really one of us who cannot remember at least a handful of Friday and Saturday nights spent trying to work on a paper or problem set while trying to ignore the ruckus of the party in the next entryway?
Closing the library early at the end of the week is a result of an assumption about Harvard students that does not apply to a significant portion of us. Perhaps more than anyone else, Harvard students have varied and hectic schedules. Schedules at Harvard are defined more by assignments, essays, and inconsistent midterm dates than a five-day workweek schedule that ends with T.G.I.F.
The closing time of 9:45 p.m. is also early enough that it takes away from the utility of the library for those who want to study before the closing hour. A student looking for a place to study at 8:45 p.m. has little incentive to lug her laptop-and-textbook-laden backpack to the library for only one hour of studying. Instead, the student is forced to wander through the dark in quest of an empty common room or an open classroom to achieve some extended silence. The extension of hours, by reducing inconveniences like these, would not only make the library useful for three more hours, but also more visited before 9:45 p.m.
Moreover, the original shift to a 24-hour-open Lamont was partly Harvard’s effort to catch up with other universities, but as is evident, it is incomplete. Many schools, including Harvard’s peer institutions like Stanford, Columbia, and Dartmouth have school-wide libraries that welcome their students 24 hours, seven days a week. There is no reason why Harvard should offer less.
An extension of Lamont hours would be no doubt welcomed and used by many. Embracing more diverse schedules, accommodating more hungry brains, and catching up with peer institutions can only be good. And, after all, although it would be very much useful to our Lamonstrous students, an extension of only three hours on two days of the week is a rather modest proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day after the midterms, a conservative columnist and a Democratic senator struck the same fiscal chord. Looking ahead, they looked back with longing at America’s last meaningful tax reform.
Here’s Evan Bayh of Indiana, telling fellow Democrats how to shake it off and get their mojo back: “A good place to start would be tax reform….Reward savings and investment. Simplify the code to reduce compliance costs and broaden the base. In 1986, this approach attracted bipartisan support and fostered growth.”
And here’s Ross Douthat, blogging “[N]early all the historical models for the kind of big reforms I’d like to see—the Reagan tax overhauls, the budget deals of the Clinton and first Bush presidencies…took place amid divided government…”
Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act of 1986 is the bill Bayh praised and the most sweeping of those hailed by Douthat. Neither Bayh nor Douthat mentioned, but both surely know, that one of the bill’s signature provisions could bring a strong tax-equity case to the debates shaping up on the Hill—first over extending the Bush cuts, then over tax policy in general.
In 1986, taking a step long sought by liberals, Reagan equalized taxes on income from investments and income from wages. With his last fiscal legacy, he ended more than six decades of lower taxes on income from wealth than income from work.
What persuaded him? In a section titled “Fairness,” the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation laid out the case. The opening minces no words: A primary objective of Congress was to provide a tax system that ensures that individuals with similar incomes pay similar amounts of tax. The ability of some individuals to reduce their tax liability excessively under prior law eroded the tax base and required tax rates to be higher than otherwise would have been necessary.
Tax breaks on capital gains came roaring back in 1997 under President Clinton and were sweetened again in 2003 by President Bush. The current rate on long-term gains stands at 15 percent, the lowest since FDR’s first term. According to the K Street spin, capital gains deserve lower rates; after all, the spinners claim, buying shares in the market grows businesses, grows jobs, and grows the economy.
In their dreams.
In reality, only a trace amount of the billions that change hands on Wall Street every day grows anything. Aside from initial public offerings and secondary offerings, not a dime that’s invested in the market goes to companies. In fact, through dividends and stock buybacks, money flows in the opposite direction—out of companies, into the hands of investors. These investors aren’t growing companies, they’re growing portfolios.
Making money in the market is a wonderful thing. It’s un-wonderful to tax market gains at a lower rate than wages, benefiting only the haves, the have-mores, and especially the have-mosts. (Except, that is, for those IPOs and secondary offerings. Gains from those transactions have a strong claim to accrue tax-free.)
Finally, in a change as basic as any made by Reagan, President Obama and Congress should shift the tax-break focus from stocks to corporate bonds. Although some bond issues simply retire debt, most raise money to upgrade and expand facilities, open new plants, and hire new people. It’s bonds—not aftermarket stock buys—that really do grow jobs and grow the economy.
Give bond interest a tax break. “Reward investment,” Senator Bayh urged. Back to you, senator (likewise, every other member of Congress).
A final report from the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, with its master plan for deficit reduction, is due at the White House on December 1. Then it’s up to Obama and Congress. From both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Americans deserve the same fairness and boldness that marked Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Gerald E. Scorse helped pass the bill requiring basis reporting for capital gains. It will begin to take effect in 2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve figured out the true intentions of WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, please let me know. In the meantime, I’m starting to feel troubled, even defensive, about the group’s mass releases of U.S. government confidential documents.
Yesterday, WikiLeaks announced it was under cyber attack. The Distributed Denial-of-Service has been popular in recent months; most notably, government websites in the United States and South Korea came under this type of attack in the summer of 2009. U.S. cyber experts learned from that DDoS assault, and they may have put it to their own use yesterday (debating the ethics of such an attack is a worthwhile endeavor for another time). It would certainly not be surprising, as the nation seems uniquely under pressure from Assange and his team.
Adding information to the public domain on important issues—this is a journalistic duty few would deny. Major publications will certainly be excited to see what WikiLeaks publishes this time, as they have in the past. The New York Times has added a whole feature, “The War Logs,” to analyze WikiLeaks’ postings on the Iraq war. Yet this latest batch of documents concerns U.S. diplomatic affairs around the world, from confidential assessments by ambassadors about foreign leaders to the private communiqués from Washington to individual embassies. This latest broadside from WikiLeaks makes the journalistic position more troubling.
In a blog post yesterday, Blake Hounshell of Foreign Policy asked if WikiLeaks has gone too far. Hounshell admitted to being eager to see the documents but expressed doubt about undermining the ability of diplomats to do their jobs and WikiLeaks’ dismissive stance on its role.  The group argues that the world should have as many classified documents as possible—any nation, any time.
That’s not really how it’s working out. It’s now increasingly hard to ignore an anti-American vendetta in Assange’s efforts. Documents about U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan may have informed the public in meaningful ways—even if they apparently had nothing new for those living in the region. With the State Department’s files, however, there will certainly be revelations, and many seem preliminarily more likely to embarrass and damage U.S. foreign policy than do anything else. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been leading efforts to mitigate the upcoming onslaught by reaching out to world leaders before ambassadors’ private observations of them come to light. Initiatives such as START—the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia—could be jeopardized.
One might argue that Assange has no vendetta against the United States and that he only publishes these U.S.-focused documents because they are what is available to his group. Consider Assange’s own words, however: “The material that we are about to release covers essentially every major issue in every country in the world.” So, ignoring the Assange arrogance factor, we have confidential U.S. government documents on every major issue in the world. Am I the only person who doesn’t believe that no matter what misdeeds the United States would want covered up, those issues also include important ones in which U.S. secrecy is beneficial to the public good?
The State Department has taken the position that these documents were obtained illegally and will risk the lives of various individuals. Assange responded by offering to negotiate on individual redactions, a possible compromise with which the U.S. government refused to participate. Even assuming that this offer of partial redactions meets the concern of individuals’ immediate safety, it does not address the broader possibility of ambassadors’ efforts being undermined in worthwhile efforts such as helping to ensure the protection of aid organizations in those nations.
WikiLeaks’ founder seems to believe that any secrecy or confidentiality by a government, or at least the U.S. government, is inherently suspect. Yet secrecy is not always sinister. The unfortunate by-product of this release is that, as WikiLeaks publishes by massive salvo, not by individual scoop, the United States will suffer politically in areas we cannot yet predict.
Like the rest of the journalistic field, I am usually excited by the prospect of breaking news that holds governments and large corporations accountable for their actions. As an American, however, I cannot help but feel uneasy at WikiLeaks’ actions. Whether by circumstance or by design, Assange seems to be harming my country’s ability to operate. Because I reject the notion that all American operations are wrongful, I cannot view this release of documents as simply a journalist’s bonanza.
We can hope that the release of these documents encourages government accountability and contributes to the public discourse. Then Assange’s latest efforts will have yielded a positive contribution for the global community. I’m now increasingly suspicious that this will not be the case.

Scientists from Harvard and MIT have discovered that human brains tend to perceive a face as either male or female depending on where it appears in our field of view, according to a recently published study.
On a computer, the team generated a number of faces ranging from extremely female, to androgynous, to extremely male. They then flashed these faces at various locations on a computer screen and recorded which gender the subjects observed.
The researchers discovered that more androgynous-looking faces, when shown in certain parts of the visual field, would sometimes look male and sometimes look female.
But the researchers also found that the regions that recognize a given face as male or female differ from person to person. That is, a face that looks male in a certain portion of the visual field might not appear male to another person when displayed in the same visual field.
“You expect the same face to look the same everywhere,” said Arash Afraz, a post-doctoral fellow at MIT and the lead author of the study. “When you examine it carefully you notice a huge difference.”
The study’s findings challenge the previously accepted notion that “visual perception is homogenous” or that an object always looks the same to a brain no matter where it is located in the visual field.
The researchers also concluded that the ability of a person to accurately identify an object depends on the size of that object.
It is much easier to recognize the gender of a large face than of a small one. For simpler objects like a line, the object need not be as large for a person to recognize it as a line.
In addition to gender, the study tested items like perceived age and weight of the faces. It found that visual field biases existed in these areas as well, although they were independent of gender bias.
According to co-author Patrick Cavanagh, a professor at the University of Paris and a research professor at Harvard, the study raises questions about the accuracy of eyewitness testimony.
“If, in a study, we present a man, and people are saying it’s a woman, that’s not very reassuring in terms of eyewitness testimony,” Cavanagh said.
According to Afraz, people have maintained these biases because they have no evolutionary need to get rid of them.
Because there is no reason behind their existence, Afraz said that such biases “can be taken as more evidence against intelligent design.”
Cavanagh said that as a result of this study, scientists should be able to measure the area of the brain within which analysis is made.
The findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal Current Biology.

Harvard researchers have developed a fuel cell that utilizes methane gas, a significant breakthrough that promises longer-lasting battery life and a more environmentally friendly power source for mobile devices in the future.
Shriram Ramanathan, a professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and his team have developed micro-fuel cells that harness energy from cheap methane gas instead of more expensive hydrogen gas, and do not utilize platinum, a traditional component in fuel cells.
Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of fuels like hydrogen and methane gas into electrical energy, which could be used to power mobile devices.
But in order for this new type of battery to be used in commercial devices, its operating temperature must be significantly reduced, which will require significant additional research.
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operate at extremely high temperatures of around 1,000 degrees Celsius. And while the fuel cell developed by Ramanathan and his team operates at 500 degrees Celsius, it is still too high a temperature for consumer products.
Similar technology exists in fuel cell cars, but due to the expensive products involved in the process, they come with a hefty price tag. SOFCs are being researched as a potential alternative energy source that might be used to phase out fossil fuel sources.
Ramanathan’s team is working on fuel cells that can power smaller devices, but he said the temperature of 500 degrees Celsius is ideal for an automobile engine.
His work, however, involves designing miniature power sources that can be integrated into mobile devices or even insect-sized robots, he said, which means the project is not complete.
SOFCs can use a variety of gases for input, but they also utilize a high temperature to enhance the oxidation-reduction reaction. That means the materials used must be strong enough to withstand the heat, according to Ramanathan.
“This is a thermally activated process,” he said, “so the higher the temperature, the better the typical performance metric. You’re sort of competing against temperature.”
Ramanathan’s platinum-free, methane-utilizing fuel cells are able to operate under 500 degrees Celsius, a feat in the overall goal of building highly compact power sources.
“The same line that brings natural gas into your home for heating can also supply your electricity in a cleaner and more efficient manner,” said Kian Kerman—a Ph.D. student who is involved in the project—highlighting the potential practical applications of the team’s findings.
Ramanathan’s research is supported by the National Science Foundation.

Boston City Councillor Ayanna Pressley has called on a city agency to investigate the shut-down of a party at a Boston nightclub arranged for black alumni and graduate students from Harvard and Yale that ended in allegations of racist conduct on the part of the club’s owner.
Pressley told The Boston Globe that she had received calls from several Harvard students complaining about the club’s past conduct regarding issues with race and that these complaints prompted her to initiate an investigation. The inquiry will be carried out by the city’s Office of Consumer Affairs and Licensing.
The incident, which occurred on Nov. 20 at Cure Lounge, began making headlines last week with the circulation of an e-mail sent by organizer Michael M. Beal ’06 alleging that the party was shut down because “we were perceived as a threat because of our skin color.”
Pressley told The Globe that she is reserving judgment until after the investigation is complete, stating that “an investigation is not an accusation.”
George Regan, a spokesperson for the nightclub, told The Globe that the club had been shut down because there had been individuals in line for the event who were known to police and that some people waiting in line for the event refused to provide identification.
According to Regan, the club’s decision to shut down the club was one with safety, not race, in mind.
The e-mail sent by Beal, a second-year student at Harvard Business School, alleged that bouncers said “local gang-bangers” had joined the crowd of black students. The club attempted to restrict access to students with Harvard and Yale student IDs, but the organizers insisted that since alumni made up a bulk of the attendees, the bouncers should continue using the guest list, according to Beal’s e-mail.
According to The Globe, Pressley said in a letter that she had never heard of any venue in Boston closing because it was  afraid of attracting “local gang-bangers.”
Beal did not return requests for comment.

Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Charles J. “Chuck” Christenson, a noted expert in managerial accounting and control, died last week of natural causes at his home in Cambridge, Mass., at the age of 80.
Christenson, an active member of the Business School faculty for over 40 years, became a renowned and prolific pioneer in the field of Business Administration over the course of his career. At the Business School, Christenson taught first-year M.B.A. courses in managerial economics and control.
During his time at Harvard, Christenson’s research focused mostly on the applications of the social sciences to business and managerial economics.
“Chuck didn’t write a lot, but what he did was related to what type of knowledge you can gain from doing this type of social science research,” said Baker Foundation Professor Robert S. Kaplan of the Harvard Business School. “He was a student and a follower of writers like Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper who taught about what you can know and how you learn it from scientific investigation.”
“Chuck strove to apply those ideas to the types of social science and management science research that was being conducted at business schools,” he added.
According to Kaplan, Christenson was responsible for the introduction of quantitative methods of research to the Business School curriculum at Harvard and throughout the country.
Born on Sept. 25, 1930 in Chicago, Christenson began his academic career with a bachelor’s degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell, according to a University press release. Christenson would go on to receive an MBA and a doctorate from the Business School.
Following a 2-year stint with the U.S. Army, where he contributed to the development of the Army’s first cost-based budgetary control system, Christenson returned to the Business School to pursue a doctorate in business administration. By 1961, he had joined the faculty, by 1968 he had been promoted to full professor, and by 1980 he had been named to the Royal Little chair—a position he would hold for the remainder of his life.
Though rather reserved and shy in disposition, Christenson managed to leave an impression on some of his colleagues.
Kaplan described Christenson as an introverted man with a dry sense of humor that showed up in seminars.
“Some of his researchers told us about how they didn’t like to do field research because they ‘couldn’t learn anything from a sample size of one,’” Kaplan recalled. “But Chuck said, ‘You know, we have only one solar system, but we’ve still learned a lot from studying it in great detail.’”

This week may be the U.S. Senate’s last chance to pass a bill that would grant amnesty to undocumented students before Congress’ term ends and a Republican majority takes over the House of Representatives.
On Nov. 17, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid vowed to vote on the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act as a standalone bill during the lame duck period. If passed, the DREAM Act would provide some undocumented youth with a 6-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service. The bill is expected to be voted on this week.
“This is the last chance we have for [the bill to pass] this year and possibly for the next three years,” said Mario Rodas, a student at the Harvard Extension School and member of the Student Immigrant Movement. “With the new Congress coming up with the Republicans, they tend to be unsupportive of the DREAM Act.”
The Student Immigrant Movement—a Massachusetts student group that advocates for immigrant students—organized a rally that will take place today in front of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston.
About 250 people are expected to attend the rally this afternoon, which will feature students speaking and sharing their stories, according to Colette S. Perold ’11, a member of the Student Immigrant Movement.
“We can’t wait two more years,” Perold said. “We have to pass this right now.”
Other student advocacy groups on campus are also making a last minute push to draw support for the bill.
Harvard College Act on a Dream, a campus immigrant rights organization, is joining with the Harvard College Democrats to create a poster campaign, featuring posters with photo portraits accompanied by a pitch for passing the DREAM Act.
The idea is to garner support from the peers of undocumented students—as opposed to just the undocumented students themselves, according to Nicolas E. Jofre ’13, co-director of Act on a Dream.
Additionally, Act on a Dream is organizing a phone banking event to encourage affiliates to make calls to their senators about the upcoming vote. The student group has also repackaged its collection of undocumented students’ stories and will be sending them to senators.
If the DREAM Act is passed in the Senate, the legislation process will carry over to the House.
Despite the failed vote in the Senate in September when Reid introduced the DREAM Act as an attached bill, Joffre said he is still optimistic.
“As always, I’m hopeful that this will be the time that it finally goes through,” Jofre said. “I think, like last time, there are definitely obstacles, so it’s an uphill climb, but not an impossible climb.”

Westboro Baptist Church, a Kansas-based religious organization which hosts anti-homosexual protests across the country, is scheduled to return to Harvard to protest outside Harvard Hillel Friday morning.
Board members of Harvard Hillel and undergraduates across campus are planning a “Surprise Absurdity Protest” to counter the Westboro Baptist Church’s anti-semitic message.
The church, known for its slogan “God hates fags,” protested in Cambridge twice last year—once at Harvard Law School and once at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
The church’s protest is part of a series of events scheduled in Massachusetts, including demonstrations outside of the Islamic Center of Boston in Wayland, Brandeis University’s Hillel, and Framingham High School, which is putting on a production of the Laramie Project.
Harvard’s counter-protest organizers said that the Surprise Absurdity Protest is meant to highlight the ridiculous nature of the Westboro Baptist Church’s message.
“We don’t want to acknowledge their protest as serious,” Hillel’s Vice President for Community Relations Lilli R. Margolin ’11 said. “We think it’s absurd.”
Margolin is working with other student groups to make the counter-protest a “whimsical event” that includes live music, food, and signs with sayings such as “God hates figs” and “The sky is too blue.”
The Westboro Baptist Church has long targeted gays and holds protests outside U.S. soldiers’ funerals, claiming that their deaths were justified due to America’s role as a “fag enabler.” The group has recently turned its attention to Jews, whom it blames for killing Jesus on its website.
The Westboro Baptist Church’s website indicates that it will be protesting outside of Harvard Hillel from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.
Counter-protesters are expected to gather inside of Hillel beginning at 9 a.m., according to Margolin.
But over House e-mail lists, some undergraduates expressed concerns about the proposed counter-protest.
Joanna F. Behrman ’13, a Jewish student from Kansas, the group’s home state, said she thinks the counter-protest would give the church undue attention.
Behrman also said that she is worried the counter-protest may endanger children, who participate in the church’s protests.
Instead, she called for a more “positive” counter-protest that would bring the campus together, instead of focusing on the “absurd” nature of the church’s claims.
In an e-mail sent over the Mather House open list, Behrman cautioned student group leaders of the possibility that the Westboro group might sue should physical contact take place.
Margolin acknowledged the possibility of legal action and said she plans to brief all counter-protesters instructing them not to engage the Westboro Baptist Church directly.
Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, participated in two previous counter-protests to the Westboro Baptist Church that occurred in Cambridge last year.
Last May, he collaborated with other student groups, including the Harvard Democrats, to organize a Phelps-a-thon fundraiser which raised money for Cambridge Cares About AIDS, which has since merged with the Aids Action Committee.
Chan said that the protest on Friday event would show the campus’ united opposition to the message of Westboro Church.
“As long as they’re doing this, there is a need for plenty more people to show them that their hate is unacceptable,” Chan said.
“It’s not so much for the Westboro Baptist Church, as for us to come together as a community,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard seniors—Kenzie Bok '11 and Jonathan U. Warsh '11—have been  awarded the prestigious Marshall Scholarship, according to a University  press release.
The scholarship provides  for two years of study, with the possibility of a year-long  extension, at a British university.
Bok, the current president of the Institute of Politics and a  Pforzheimer House history concentrator, plans to pursue studies in  theology and intellectual history at the University of Cambridge,  according to the release.
Warsh, who is involved with the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter,  will enroll in a joint degree program with the London School of  Economics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He is a  resident of Lowell House and government concentrator.
Bok and Warsh bring Harvard's total count of Marshall Scholars to  249. The program was instituted in 1953 and commemorates George  Marshall, who led efforts to provide economic aid to Europe after the  devastation unleashed during World War II.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another year, and another BCS conference team falls to the Harvard men’s basketball squad.
For the fourth straight season, the Crimson took down a school from a power conference, this time beating Colorado at Lavietes Pavilion yesterday, 82-66.
“[It was] a very good win, a statement win, a program-building kind of win for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
In the prior two seasons, Harvard has beaten ACC member Boston College on the road, 74-67 in 2009-10 and 82-70 in 2008-09. In 2007-08, the Crimson beat Michigan of the Big Ten at home, 62-51.
“We just see [these games] as opportunities,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “You see the name on the front of their chest, and there’s a little fear in you because you’re playing a bigger school. But all that does is just make you clamp down and just be ready.”
Yesterday’s win—the most one-sided victory of the bunch—was the program’s first against a school from the Big 12. Under Amaker, Harvard is 4-5 against schools from the BCS conferences.
“We’ve been fortunate, lucky in some cases,” Amaker said. “We’ve had some moments thus far...in our tenure here to be able to knock off some, quote unquote, BCS conference teams.”
The Crimson will play David to the power conference’s Goliath three more times this year. It travels to Michigan next Saturday, to UConn on Dec. 22, and to BC on Jan. 5.
“It certainly gives us a great sense of confidence that we can match up and suit up...against teams from that level and obviously have some success,” Amaker said.
GO BIG OR GO HOME
While junior co-captain Keith Wright was unquestionably the anchor of Harvard’s frontcourt, the Crimson relied on a few other big men to rotate in and provide valuable minutes, especially as fouls began to accrue in the second half.
Playing in just his second game after recovering from a broken foot, sophomore forward Kyle Casey played 13 minutes, providing a spark particularly on the defensive end, where he contributed two blocks and a steal.
“He’s coming [along],” Amaker said. “[He’s] not nearly where we’d like for him to be, but it’s a process.”
The sophomore’s biggest play came toward the end of the second half, when he skied in the paint to swat a floater by Buffalo guard Alec Burks. But seconds later, Casey committed a foul on Burks—a fitting outcome for a game in which Casey fouled out.
“We’re just working him back into the offense. He’s definitely going to play more as his foot continues to get better,” Wright said. “He’s showing a lot of maturity given the situation he’s in. He’s definitely helping the team a lot.”
The other big man that stepped up was junior Andrew Van Nest. The junior held down the paint when Wright went to the bench and provided a boost with three field goals, including a three, and a thunderous dunk late in the second half.
Five minutes into the second frame, as sophomore guard Brandyn Curry was inbounding under Harvard’s own hoop, Van Nest rolled off a pick and received the pass in the middle of the lane. The big man, not known for his aerial displays, took off and dunked over two Colorado defenders.
“I have no idea [where that came from],” Wright said. “I told him, ‘You’ve just got to jump hard, and just dunk it, man.’ I guess he finally listened to me. We were all going crazy in the locker room after the game. It was definitely big.”
DELAYED REACTION
Trailing as they went into the second half, the Buffaloes sought to change up their offensive and defensive strategies. Throughout the period, Colorado made a determined effort to get to the free-throw line and pressure the ball full-court.
The Crimson had difficulty adapting to both changes, as it gave up 22 free-throw attempts in the second frame and turned the ball over multiple times in the backcourt.
“We didn’t respond very well,” Amaker said. “We couldn’t keep them off the line...We didn’t handle pressure very well...But we were able to kind of regroup and recover from that and put the game back in our favor with a comfortable margin.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some unfamiliar faces joined the usual spectators at Lavietes Pavilion yesterday, as over a dozen NBA scouts watched Colorado guards Cory Higgins and Alec Burks take on the Harvard men’s basketball team.
But that wasn’t all that was unusual about the matchup. For the first time since 2007, the Crimson hosted a BCS-conference opponent, and for the first time in program history, Harvard defeated a Big 12 team.
Behind 19 points and nine rebounds from junior co-captain Keith Wright, the Crimson (4-1) handled the Buffaloes (2-3), never trailing en route to an 82-66 victory.
“Certainly an incredibly gratifying win for us,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, who has coached the Crimson to a win over an opponent from a power-six conference in each of the past four seasons. “I thought our ability to stay composed and show a lot of concentration and finish plays really allowed us to come away with a very good win.”
A major focus for Amaker’s squad was clamping down defensively and slowing Colorado’s pair of talented guards—Burks and Higgins—who entered the contest averaging 23 and 18.8 points per game, respectively.
While the pair combined for 41 points on the afternoon, Harvard was pleased with its overall defensive effort, limiting the Buffaloes to 38.8 percent shooting from the field while forcing 15 turnovers.
“For the most part, we did what we wanted to do defensively, which a lot of the time means we’ll do pretty well in the end,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “We really wanted to not let them run because they’re a more comfortable team when they’re getting up and down instead of in the half-court.”
The strategy paid off, as the Buffaloes were held to their lowest scoring output of the season.
Offensively, the Crimson relied heavily on Wright, running the majority of its sets through the post. The Buffaloes had no answer for the 6’9” forward, who entered the contest as the Ivy League’s second-leading scorer, as Wright had his way in the paint, finishing 8-of-11 from the field.
And when Wright faced double teams, the forward was able to successfully find the open man on the perimeter, dishing out a career-high six assists.
“If I see a double, I’m kicking it out,” Wright said. “That’s one of the emphases on the board every game is playing inside-out.”
“Keith is a very unselfish player,” Amaker said. “He’s an easy guy to play with. He’ll pitch it out, and we get a chance to step into our shots.”
McNally and sophomore Christian Webster were the major beneficiaries of Wright’s unselfishness, finishing with 17 and 20 points, respectively, on combined 6-of-12 shooting from beyond the arc.
McNally played a crucial role in building on Harvard’s nine-point halftime lead, knocking down a pair of treys in the first 2:10 of the second frame to lead the Crimson on a 9-2 run.
McNally ignited the Harvard run on the Crimson’s opening possession of the second half, stroking a deep ball from the left corner off a pass from sophomore Brandyn Curry.
On Colorado’s first possession, McNally pulled down a rebound off a missed jumper from Alec Burks and then found Wright in the post for the easy two on the Crimson’s next possession.
Burks answered with a reverse layup to cut the Harvard lead to 12, but McNally dialed up another deep ball—this time off a pass from Wright—to pad the Crimson lead.
Two possessions later, Webster gave Harvard its biggest lead of the contest, drilling his second of three three-pointers on the afternoon to put the Crimson ahead, 49-32.
“We came out of the blocks, and I thought our kids responded very well at the half,” Amaker said. “I thought we put them on their heels right away, and it made a big difference, obviously, in the outcome of the game.”
Colorado made one last push midway through the second period, going on a 10-3 run capped off by a three-pointer and an and-one layup from Higgins to cut the Crimson lead to 11 with 8:48 left to play.
But Harvard didn’t let its lead dip into single digits thanks to some timely buckets from Wright down the stretch, and the Crimson cruised to the 16-point win.
“From an outside perspective, people probably [didn’t] think we had a chance,” McNally said. “But when we play well and together, we can beat a lot of teams, and that’s what we did [yesterday].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a three-day rest for the holiday, the Harvard women’s basketball team looked sluggish against Holy Cross yesterday afternoon.
Nothing went right for the visiting Crimson (3-2) in the first half, a period in which the Crusaders (3-3) missed slightly under half their shots. Harvard had no chance in keeping up with Holy Cross, shooting a dismal 15.4 percent and getting outrebounded, 26-14. In the second half, the Crimson outscored the Crusaders, 37-30, but it was nowhere near sufficient to overcome the 26-point deficit from the first 20 minutes. Harvard dropped the contest, 72-53.
“We shot terribly,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “We didn’t execute well on offense. Some shots were rushed, and other shots that we normally hit we didn’t hit today. To go along with that, we didn’t rebound the ball well following our shots. Overall, it was a pretty poor performance.”
Though the Crimson played a much different game in the second half, the first half defined the outcome of the encounter. The Crusaders jumped out to a double-digit lead, 23-11, in the first 11 minutes of the game. Rookie Alex Smith was critical in setting the tempo for Holy Cross in that span, sinking three three-pointers, and Amy Lepley contributed four points as well. Another jumper by the Crusaders gave Holy Cross a 14-point lead with 8:45 left on the clock.
But Harvard was not ready to go down without a fight, and sophomore Jasmine Evans and freshman Christine Clark provided a transient offensive spark. Clark’s three-point play and a bucket off of Evans’ steal brought the score closer, 25-16, but that would mark the last time the Crimson scored in the half. The Crusaders’ defense, combined with poor shooting by Harvard, kept the Crimson from putting up any more points after 13 minutes of play.
Holy Cross scored 17 unanswered points, sending the Crimson to the locker room at halftime with a 42-16 score to think about.
“The starters need to take full responsibility for how we are starting games,” Matera said. “I don’t think we are starting games strongly at all. We just need to come ready to play...This is something that we can’t let become a trend. For the two losses, that’s what has been happening...and that’s not good enough.”
Harvard gave false hope of a comeback to start the second half, as Evans hit a three-point shot, but the Crusaders’ Alyssa May responded with one of her own from beyond the arc. The Crimson hit four of its first seven shots to start the period, but despite the team’s improved shooting effort, Holy Cross was able to keep up.
With 13 minutes left to play, the game’s leading scorer, Meredith Ward, had a three-point play that restored the deficit to 26. Ward finished the game with 17 points.
For the Crimson, Evans, Clark, and sophomore Victoria Lippert led the team with 12 points each. It marked Clark’s fourth straight double-digit scoring effort.
“I think that the team has a very good atmosphere to be around,” the rookie said about her recent success. “The team is very supportive of one another, and it makes it easy to play on this team, because everybody wants each teammate to succeed.”
The Crusaders’ Christine Ganser made a bucket to widen the gap to 56-28. Whitney Fremeau—second to Ward in points scored with 15—hit a shot, and the Crusaders followed it up with another score to further humble Harvard. With the deficit now at 32 points, the Crimson responded with a 13-6 run to set the score at 66-41.
With three minutes left to play, Harvard put together a 10-2 run to lessen the deficit. But Holy Cross finished the game with a strong defensive effort, never leading by fewer than 17 points.
The first-half lead provided the Crusaders with a needed cushion, as the Crimson stepped up its shooting in the second half, hitting 24 of 35 shots. Because of the poor start, Harvard still finished the game with a low overall field goal percentage of 26.2 compared to Holy Cross’s 50.9 percent.
“As a team, it was a terrible performance, and we need to come back and work hard tomorrow,” Matera said, “because today, [the team] definitely wasn’t nearly a good enough team to be in the ball game, let alone win it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ice hockey games last 60 minutes, but the way events transpired on Saturday, the Harvard men’s hockey team’s contest at Dartmouth’s Thompson Arena was won during a six-minute stretch. From 12:39 to 18:15 in the first period, the Big Green (6-3-1, 5-2-1 ECAC) put the game away by building a 4-0 lead over the Crimson (2-6-0, 2-6-0). Dartmouth ultimately earned a 5-2 victory.
“It was a tough one,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “We didn’t play our best this weekend.”
“I think as a team we were frustrated with the way we performed,” junior Alex Killorn added. “We played pretty well in the second and third period, but the lead [Dartmouth] amounted in the first seemed insurmountable.”
With the loss, Harvard extended its losing streak to five games. The defeat capped a season sweep of the Crimson by the Big Green, which outscored Harvard, 13-4, over two games this weekend. It was Dartmouth’s first season sweep of the Crimson since 1995-96.
Early in the first period, the squads found themselves in an even battle. But late in the period, the Big Green took control of the game and dominated play. Dartmouth outshot Harvard, 24-4, in the frame.
The first goal of the game came 13 minutes in, when Adam Estoclet scored on a power play created by junior Ryan Grimshaw’s interference penalty. With disorder in front of net, Dartmouth’s Estoclet controlled the puck off a rebound and slotted it past senior goaltender Ryan Carroll.
Four minutes later, the Big Green extended its lead with a goal from Matthew Lindblad. With the two-goal advantage, Dartmouth took a firm grasp of the game’s momentum, and things began to fall apart for the Crimson.
Over the next 90 seconds, Harvard let in two more goals. After positioning himself in front of the Crimson crease, Nick Walsh got his stick on a teammate’s shot, redirecting it around Carroll. Scott Fleming then capitalized on a Harvard turnover and sent a slapshot between the pipes.
Up 4-0, the Big Green had put the game out of reach for the Crimson, which has not scored more than four goals in a game this season.
“After they scored that first goal, I think we went into a shell, kind of,” Killorn said. “We didn’t really take it well. It’s something that happened to us against Quinnipiac, and we’re still trying to figure that out.”
In the second and third periods, Harvard reorganized defensively and began to establish an attack. The Crimson edged Dartmouth, 29-18, in shots in the final two frames and outscored the Big Green, 2-1.
“We just tried to simplify it a little bit,” Huxley said. “Shoot everything on net.”
Harvard’s first goal of the contest came on a power play 5:35 into the second period, when senior Matt McCollem, who led the squad with six shots, found the back of the net. The scoring play began when junior Daniel Moriarty received a pass from Killorn and sent the puck on net. Dartmouth goalie James Mello, who made 31 saves, blocked the shot, but McCollem cleaned up the rebound.
Both the Crimson and the Big Green went 1-for-4 on the power play.
At the end of the second, Dartmouth extended its lead to 5-1. Blueliner Evan Stephens converted a long-range shot that found its way through the Harvard defense.
In the last minute of the game, freshman Dan Ford added a goal for Crimson. The defenseman’s first tally of his collegiate career came off assists from Moriarty and sophomore Conor Morrison. In his first start of the year, Carroll made 37 saves.
“[Carroll] played well,” Huxley said. “We didn’t really give him the support that he needed.”
Heading into the last two weeks of the semester, Harvard will look to put the brakes on its current skid. But history will not be on the Crimson’s side. Over the past three seasons, Harvard is 2-11-1 in the month of December. The Crimson currently sits second-to-last in the ECAC, ahead of winless Colgate.
“We’ve just got to come out from the beginning of the game ready to compete,” Huxley said. “That’s pretty much what it comes down to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it keeps all of its skates on the ice, the Harvard women’s hockey team has shown the ability to outshoot some of the top teams in the nation.
But struggles with penalties have proven to the Crimson’s kryptonite this season, and this weekend’s contests against No. 7 Minnesota (10-5-0, 5-5-0 WCHA) were no exception. Entering the weekend ranked last in the nation on the penalty kill, No. 9 Harvard (4-4-2, 4-2-2 ECAC) surrendered four power-play goals over two games en route to losing back-to-back contests at Ridder Arena. The Golden Gophers felled the Crimson, 3-0, on Friday before topping Harvard’s skaters, 4-2, in yesterday’s game.
“[On the penalty kill], we have a lot [to] work on,” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said. “We made minor mistakes that could be avoided.”
The lapses overshadowed a weekend in which Harvard outshot Minnesota, 59-44.
“The whole team put in an incredible effort. We were determined to play our game, no matter what the score said,” Ryabkina said. “If we see them [again], we’re going to be ready.”
MINNESOTA 4, HARVARD 2
Three Gopher goals in 20 minutes of ice time put to rest any hopes the Crimson had of splitting its weekend slate.
“I think we let them have a lot more shots [during that time],” senior forward Katharine Chute said. “We came out with a lot of intensity. We let that fall back...one thing we’re looking to do is to play a full 60 minutes. We gave them a few too many chances during that stretch.”
Minnesota junior Kelly Seeler was the first skater to put the puck in the net. Barely inside the offensive zone, the defenseman rifled a slapshot past Harvard rookie netminder Lauren Joarnt. Four minutes later, the Gophers struck again, this time with a goal from Sarah Erickson.
After Joarnt had allowed her fourth goal, she was replaced by sophomore Laura Bellamy. The duo has been splitting time of late, alternating in the starter’s spot over the past three weekends.
“They’re both playing to the best of their abilities,” Ryabkina said. “We weren’t there on the rebounds. We never expect goalies to get the second, third rebounds.”
“I think they played pretty well,” tri-captain Kate Buesser added. “We just need to give them some better defensive support.”
The Crimson provided Bellamy with that support in the second half of Sunday’s game. The sophomore only faced four shots and was able to turn them all away.
Having outshot Minnesota all game long, Harvard finally converted with a little over two minutes left in the second period. On the power play, the Crimson was able to mount enough pressure in front of the net to confuse Gopher sophomore goaltender Noora Raty and give Buesser room to find the net. Almost 20 minutes later, Buesser struck again to bring the game within two, but by then a Minnesota victory was all but assured.
“[They] were a couple of really fun games,” Chute said. “I think we stepped it up a notch...Everyone brought their best game.”
MINNESOTA 3, HARVARD 0
After a scoreless first 15 minutes, two power-play goals in a six-minute span doomed the Crimson on Friday and set the stage for a winless weekend in Minneapolis.
Harvard actually outshot the Gophers in the first period, 11-4, but a slashing penalty by Crimson sophomore Hilary Hayssen opened the door for Minnesota. The Gophers capitalized on one of their few opportunities of the period when sophomore defenseman Mira Jalosuo scored her first goal of the season off assists from freshman Amanda Kessel and sophomore Becky Kortum.
Harvard closed out the first period with another penalty, this one a holding penalty by freshman Marissa Gedman, which paved the way for a second Minnesota power-play goal.
This time, it was Gopher junior Jen Schoullis who lit the lamp.
“I think their best chances came on the power play,” Chute said.
The Crimson has now surrendered 14 goals in 43 penalty-kill chances, a nation-worst kill rate of 67.4 percent.
Schoullis’ goal paved the way for a second period in which Minnesota outshot Harvard, 14-4, but Bellamy turned away every shot that came her way in the frame.
The sophomore would only allow one more goal all weekend, a Schoullis tally in the third period.
Meanwhile, the Gophers were able to shut out the Crimson despite losing their top goaltender, Raty, in the second period, after the netminder collided with Harvard sophomore defenseman Josephine Pucci.
“[Raty] is always in the right place at the right time,” Chute said of the Finnish Olympic goaltender.
But on Friday, so was Minnesota’s second-stringer Jenny Lura, a senior from British Columbia, who finished the game with 10 saves in 29:49 of play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undoubtedly the most successful recent alum of the Harvard football team, Matt Birk '98 has continued to raise the bar for Crimson athletes in major professional sports.
Once again, the center is one of the top offensive linemen in the NFL. With Birk at center, the Baltimore Ravens rank fourth in Rush pwr for rushes through the center. Rush pwr records the number of times when a team successfully attains the two or fewer yards needed for a first down or touchdown on third or fourth down or on any goal-to-go scenario. In other words, when his team needs crucial yardage, Birk is one of the best centers in the league at creating holes.
Birk has started every game for Baltimore this season and has helped the Ravens to their first-place standing in the AFC North, a place they share with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Only three teams, the New England Patriots, the New York Jets, and the Atlanta Falcons, have higher winning percentages than Baltimore's .727 mark right now.
Birk has excelled for every team that's given him a roster spot. On his first NFL team, the Minnesota Vikings, the Twin Cities native was named All Pro twice and was selected to the Pro Bowl six times. Here in Cambridge, he was an All Ivy and All New England selection, and prior to that he was an All State selection in both basketball and football while attending St. Paul's Cretin-Derham Hall, also the alma mater of Twins' catcher Joe Mauer.
Birk has also worked to make an impact off the field, founding an organization called Matt Birk's HIKE Foundation, which seeks to provide educational resources for at-risk children in the Baltimore area. For his work, Birk has been his team's "Man of the Year" seven times. In 2008 and 2009, Birk even earned league-wide recognition, as he was the runner up for the NFL Player's Association Man of the Year Award (the "Byron Whizzer White Award") in '09 after being named one of only three to be named a finalist for the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year the season before. The All Pro has also pledged to contribute after his career is over, agreeing last year to donate his brain to science in the ongoing fight against football-related injuries.

This past Thanksgiving, our graduating seniors were given a little extra opportunity to give thanks. A blog post, rightly named “What 2011 is Thankful For," is urging the graduating class of Harvard to post comments on the things they are most grateful about during their time at Harvard.
 
Responses range from the seriously nostalgic memory to the blatantly whimsical anecdote. Since the publishing of the post, 56 comments have been entered, with students reminiscing about anything ranging from Stein Clubs and great TFs to their favorite student organizations and Burdick’s hot chocolate. One senior even focused her entire response on the Cabot dining hall, which she and her blockmates nicknamed “Mom."
 
Unsurprisingly, seniors overwhelmingly cite their roommates and blockmates as being among the most meaningful relationships at college and beyond. House communities—dining hall staff, security guards, tutors, and administrators—were also given high praises.
 
It is also heartwarming to see that after four years of finals and papers, the dream of constant learning is still well and alive for Harvard’s soon-to-be graduates. Cate E. Nelson '11 perhaps says it best in her response: “I’m grateful for identity crises...For not staying the same and for growing."

For centuries, man has sought to find eternal youth.  Although such a concept has remained a myth, for household rodents, that dream has come closer to reality.
Researchers at Harvard Medical School have been able to reverse symptoms of the aging process in mice. The scientists said they hope to apply this research to combat the symptoms of human aging.
The scientists, working at the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, did not simply stop or slow down the aging process. “Instead, we witnessed this dramatic reversal in the signs and symptoms of aging,” said the lead author, Ronald A. DePinho, a Medical School professor.
DePinho said that the mice’s worn-out organs were physically regenerated. That meant that shrunken brains increased in size, the neural stem cell reserves were replenished, and coat hair was restored to a healthy sheen. The mice even regained fertility.
Much of the genetic damage that causes aging occurs due to the erosion of the tips of chromosomes, called telomeres. The special enzyme telomerase can restore telomere function. The research team bred genetically modified mice with a telomerase gene that could be toggled on and off. When the gene was turned off, the mice aged rapidly. But when the team turned the gene back on, the aging process of the mice reversed.
“This is the first time that a very severely aged, degenerative state, equivalent to what you might see in somebody who’s in the eighth or ninth decade of life, has been reversed in an animal,” said DePinho.
DePinho said that although some on the research team speculated that replicating the study in humans could lead to an increased risk of cancer, out of all the mice tested, none developed any form of cancer.
With an increasing number of older Americans, DePinho said he thinks his research could lead to an increase in their productivity and health. While more research needs to be done, DePinho's study suggests that what was once thought impossible may not be that far from reality after all.
