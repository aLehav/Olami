After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama declared that, in today’s world, “most young people will need some higher education.”  As he put it, “It’s a simple fact: The more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class.”  That beneficial education does not simply mean four-year institutions, though. In fact, a central element of Obama’s higher education agenda is vigorous investment in community colleges.
 
At the state level, Massachusetts has received attention for its commitment to similar goals. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 recently announced a $27.4 million investment to expand Massasoit Community College’s capacity for students seeking degrees in the booming healthcare sector, and last week Obama praised Boston’s Bunker Hill Community College for its intensified commitment to help incoming students prepare for their freshman years. These efforts are a step in the right direction for Massachusetts to expand quality education and equip American workers for the modern world.
 
Community colleges play a distinct and critical role in providing skills in an increasingly knowledge-based economy. Currently, many tend to view a four-year bachelor’s degree as the only path to financial security. However, the Boston Foundation estimates that 38 percent of jobs in the 10-year period from 2006 through 2016 will require more than a high school diploma but less than a four-year degree; by comparison, 39 percent will require a four-year degree. In fact, according to Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, approximately 30 percent of Americans with associate’s degrees earn more than those with a bachelor’s. Any successful 21st-century approach to higher education must recognize this diversity of options and accordingly provide multiple routes for obtaining an excellent education, whether through a community college or a four-year university.
 
This is an issue on which Massachusetts still has much room to improve. As we have noted in the past, while Massachusetts leads in many high-paying fields, its achievement gap has also worsened, in part due to disparities in post-secondary opportunities. While the state houses many of the nation’s strongest liberal arts colleges and research universities, its community colleges have not kept pace. In Massachusetts, the cost of community college exceeds the national average; meanwhile, in-state graduation rates remain below average. That makes the state’s recent investments in community colleges a particularly welcome effort. In particular, the expansion of healthcare education means that more students can gain knowledge and skills that are highly applicable in the modern economy. This investment should help make well-paid, fulfilling livelihoods accessible to more people in the near future.
 Of course, Massachusetts’ recent efforts, while encouraging, do not represent anything near a conclusive solution to the issue of equity in higher education. However, by strengthening the community college system in the long term, Massachusetts and the nation as a whole can help ensure that all residents have access to the lifelong benefits that quality higher education brings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The composition of your body—and my body—is possibly different from what you thought. Did you know that there are roughly ten times as many bacterial cells in each of our bodies as there are human cells? The bacteria are small and mostly in our intestines, so it’s nothing to worry about. But we should always remember that, by numbers, we are mostly bacteria. 
I’m telling you this because you know who else was mostly bacteria? Albert Einstein. And Thomas Edison, and Thomas Jefferson. And Mohandas Gandhi and Marie Curie. At the atomic level, or even at the cellular level, organ level, or microbiological level, there’s really very little difference between any of us and any of these people, our heroes. We are all in the extremely fortunate position of living at a time and in a place where we have tremendous opportunities to shape our lives. So if you want to be like these people, you’ve got the equipment. It’s only a matter of how you spend your time.
A friend of mine, a scientist, recently said, “If I knew what Nobel Prizes would be given during the next twenty years, I could probably do many of those experiments.” It’s true, and with a bit of training so could any of you. A few years ago the Nobel Prize in physics went to two guys who did an experiment with scotch tape and graphite.
I’m talking about science here, because that is what I know best. But of course the same applies equally to other realms of life: to art, medicine, business, and public policy. Every Harvard student has the capacity to write the words, paint the picture, start the business, or make the speech that will revolutionize any of these areas.
So how do you figure out how to do world-changing work? Of course I don’t know, because I haven’t done it. But I’ve looked around at other people, and here are some thoughts.
There are two things that I believe are important for making great advances in any field. The first is that you need technical skills. You have to know how to design a circuit, write a three-part harmony, motivate a group, or integrate by parts. Harvard will do an excellent job getting you started on learning these skills. But there are thousands, maybe millions, of people who will receive similar levels of training, and who will probably be equally technically competent.
The real challenge—and fun—lies in deciding how to apply your skills. This is where you get to imagine what might be, to conceive of something in your mind that has never existed in the 14 billion year history of the universe. And then you can work to make that thought into reality.
The joy of creating a new configuration of matter or thoughts is, I think, one of the greatest joys there is. And it’s remarkably easy. When you go to the dining hall tonight, look carefully at all the trays of food. It won’t be hard to combine the items into a dish that has never been eaten before in the history of humanity. Asparagus with peanut butter, ketchup, and Cheerios might not be super delicious, but it will be original. In fact, each of you could easily eat a dish never previously eaten in the history of humanity for every meal for the rest of your life.
But being indiscriminately wacky will not, by itself, bring about revolutions. It’s also a good idea to work on an important problem. Now, I want to be clear what I mean by an important problem. There are the classics: renewable energy, the environment, cancer, HIV, poverty, injustice. A lot of people are working on those—you can too, and they’re important. But there are tons of hugely important problems that receive very little attention. And it can be fun to be doing something different from everyone else.
A good friend of mine is a professor at MIT. And you know what she studies? Mucus! Yes, mucus. Now this is something we all have recreational experience with. In fact, each of us makes about a liter of it every day. But she thought to study it, to look into its mechanical and chemical properties: to study how microbes—bacteria and viruses—move in it. She’s discovering all sorts of fascinating things about this miracle material. And it’s important: Most infections people get start with a pathogen crossing a mucus membrane. Yet we know almost nothing about mucus. Often the most interesting problems are right under—or in—our noses.
So here is some free advice: get in the habit—if you’re not in it already—of thinking up unusual, wacky ideas. And write them down. An idea that seems crazy now might be quite practical in a few years. And keep your eyes open for interesting, important problems, and treasure them when you find them. So you’ll have this list of important problems and this continual stream of wacky ideas; and before too long one of those wacky ideas might be a solution to one of those important problems. In the meantime, stay open-minded, work hard, and good luck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last month, Harvard President Drew G. Faust issued a condemnation of the American Studies Association’s vote in favor of an academic boycott of Israel, a decision meant to redress the injustices that face Palestinians within both Israel and the occupied territories of West Bank and Gaza. 
As members of the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, a student organization whose mission is to support the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and equality, we find Israeli academic institutions to be complicit in Palestinian oppressions and limitations to education.
Faust’s condemnation is apathetic to the systematic oppression faced by Palestinians under the yoke of Israeli institutional racism.  
The ASA, established in 1951, is a respected institution whose boycott is an example of growing consciousness within the public and academic worlds on the issue of Israel-Palestine. The vote for this ASA resolution received the largest voter participation in the organization's history. 
Alongside the ASA, the Association for Asian-American Studies, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, and the Association for Humanist Sociology have endorsed resolutions to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The Modern Language Association hosted a roundtable at its conference this month in Chicago to discuss academic boycotts “through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”
These boycotts demand justice for a Palestinian population, particularly students, that is consistently harassed by the Israeli military, infringing upon their lives and academic freedoms—such as the frequent and vastly documented child arrests recorded in the West Bank in a 2013 report by UNICEF. 
Just last school-year, members of our organization wrote an article, “Israel vs. No. 2 Pencils,” on Israel’s sudden seizure of all October SAT exams destined for the occupied territories, forcibly delaying the exam for a class of applicants.  
Harvard itself has only one student from Gaza, Abderhman Abuhashem ’16, whose travel to and from home is severely affected by arbitrary travel restrictions on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. This is a true example of the “subversion” by Israel of the very “academic freedoms and values necessary for the free-flow of ideas” Faust advocates. Yet, Abderhman represents one of many Palestinian students and youth who resiliently seek their human rights, dignity, and education. We stand in solidarity with them.  
Moreover, we were disappointed that The Crimson’s reporting on Faust’s statement did not include voices of those who formed and endorsed the academic boycott. Better coverage might have noted that this boycott, part of the broader Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, is in fact increasingly supported by groups across the United States and the world. 
The global movement seeking to end the occupation and enfranchise Palestinians through boycotts is growing, and winning, following in the footsteps of the South African anti-apartheid movement that also included academic boycotts. 
The boycott is a nonviolent approach supported by Palestinian solidarity and justice groups to demand that Israel abide by international law and that Palestinians be given fair opportunities, in their daily lives and in academic institutions globally, without severe limitation by Israeli policy. Attempts to label those who criticize Israel for its anti-Palestinian state policies as “anti-Semitic” are ideologically incoherent and are rejected categorically by social justice organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace. 
President Faust said in her statement on fossil fuel divestment that steps “that would appear to position the University as a political actor rather than an academic institution” are contrary to Harvard’s goals as an academic institution. Yet, on the issue of Palestinian life and human rights, Faust takes issue with a nonviolent movement against oppressive Israeli state policies. As Harvard students, we recognize this as our university’s disappointing complicity in perpetuating systems of injustice, alienating our cause. 
President Faust has taken an anti-humanitarian position on the issue of the ASA boycott, a position insupportable before international law or by the history of other movements that sought to end systems of apartheid. 
President Faust should retract her statement with growing campus and global support for the BDS human rights movement in mind and adhere to a position as a Harvard president on the side of human rights that are necessary to academic freedom. Her current position perpetuates the systematic injustice Palestinians face.
As Harvard students committed to social justice for all, we will not stand for academic institutions that do not secure the basic human rights due to all people, from Cambridge to Palestine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Thanks to the summer internship process, even Harvard students are no strangers to rejection. All of the letters read the same way: “Thank you for your application. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a position, but we encourage you to apply again next year.” Sadly, for me, there is no “next year” to fall back on. With my senior year on the horizon, this upcoming summer has presented itself as the crucial moment not only for securing a respectable internship, but for cementing my career as well. 
When these same rejection letters appeared in my email inbox by the masses last year, I comforted myself by saying that companies wanted to hire someone who would soon enter the work force, or perhaps someone with a bit more experience under his or her belt. But receiving a rejection letter in your final “college summer” carries with it a much stronger sting. To me, these letters seem to say, “We’re not willing to invest in you as a potential future employee.” 
Of course, there’s no guarantee that college graduates won’t land jobs at the very companies that once rejected them as interns. But, for us rejects, the odds don’t seem to be in our favor. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, reports an increased likelihood that undergraduates and MBA students alike will go on to work for the companies at which they interned. In the fields of banking and consulting, and even in the startup world, people are beginning to describe the internship as a “try before you buy” or “working interview” method.
But even for an English concentrator interested in a writing career, the hiring process is rigorous. Most publications require previous experience—the more prestigious, the better. By this logic, securing an internship at The Boston Globe or Penguin Books gives one a significant advantage toward ultimately landing a job at these companies or their competitors. 
Given the current professional climate, we might be better off treating our rejection letters as wake-up calls. “This is your final warning before entering the job market. You need to do more to get hired.” Or perhaps we should view these letters, as I have begun to, as not-so-subtle hints: “Maybe you should consider grad school. Or another career.” 
Of course, we have to be careful not to give too much weight to emails, “Not Inviteds” (for my On-Campus Interview friends), or pieces of paper. After all, it is possible that a company that is unable to extend an internship offer will be more than able to offer a full-time position. Or maybe the intern applicant pool differs from the pool applying for permanent positions. Nevertheless, rejection letters can and should cause us to evaluate our desirability as job candidates. 
More importantly, a rejection letter can open up a dialogue with a potential employer. Receiving one serves as the perfect opportunity to ask the employer about the qualities they look for in a new hire, or to demonstrate your continued interest in the position (for the next go-round).
And, despite how it may seem, there is always another go-round. What we as college student must realize is that these letters don’t carry the permanency of college rejection letters. There really is always next year, even if that means accepting a less than desirable job at the outset of your career. It’s commonly accepted that hard work and long hours don’t ensure success the way they may have in past decades. But perhaps a clarification is necessary. While hard work and long hours may not yield instant success in modern times, they still make success possible. 
Yes, when we first receive rejection letters, we view them as obstructions to our future careers. But maybe what these letters are telling us is that we need to work harder to open that passage to the future. As students about to enter the work force, we cannot possibly have dedicated the time and effort necessary for achieving our professional goals at the outset of our careers. And while a Harvard degree is certainly a noteworthy accomplishment, it is not always, if ever, a shortcut to success. Next time, don’t be discouraged when you skim that letter and see the word “unfortunately” on the screen or page. Fortune may not be yours at that moment, but it is certainly yours for the taking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite increasing the amount of federal funds available for scientific research, the $1.1 trillion spending bill that passed in Congress last week does not do enough to restore funding to the agencies that fuel much of the investigative work occurring at Harvard and other institutions across the nation, a University spokesperson said Friday.
If signed by President Obama—and there has been no indication that he will veto the bipartisan effort—the legislation would lessen, slightly, the effects of sequestration. The NIH, a top awarder of research grants, would see its budget increase to $29.9 billion, a 2.8 percent bump from FY 2013 post-sequester levels, according to a notice posted by Harvard’s Office of Sponsored Research. The NSF, another significant awarder, would see its budget increase to $7.17 billion, $288 million more than its FY 2013 post-sequester level.
Both agencies had requested significantly more funding than they ultimately received in the spending bill, and neither saw its funding restored to pre-sequester levels.
“The sequester lops 5 [percent] off federal research accounts each year; this bill only mitigates these cuts for the next two years, and it only softens the blow by about half,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in the Friday statement. “The sequester still will result in delayed discoveries, cures, treatments and technologies, and its impact on the next generation of scientists cannot be measured."
Last spring, when across-the-board federal budget cuts—collectively known as sequestration—took effect, Harvard researchers who had faced shrinking and stagnant funding levels worried that the pot of money available for research grants might dry up even more. The sequester mandated budget cuts of approximately five percent from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation and an eight percent budget reduction from defense agencies that provide research funding.
Both within and outside of Harvard, University President Drew G. Faust has also been vocal about the impact of the sequester. During her Commencement address in May, Faust detailed the ramifications of the cuts and warned that Harvard—which received over $650 million in federal research funding in fiscal year 2012—could lose tens of millions of dollars annually as long as the automatic cuts continued.
Faust, who according to Galvin was traveling to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time, a black woman will become president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Alexis C. Wilkinson ’15, a Leverett House economics concentrator, will lead  the organization in the coming spring and fall semesters. With Eleanor H. Parker ’15 soon taking on the role of vice president, or Ibis, the Lampoon will also have women as the organization’s two highest-ranking leaders for the first time in its nearly 140-year history.
In a phone interview Sunday, Wilkinson said that she hopes her election will send a message that the Lampoon is making progress in staff diversity.
“I want to send the message that there’s obviously still a lot of work to be done as far as diversifying staff and making sure that all organizations are open to all people who want to be a part of them,” Wilkinson said. “But things are changing for the better.... If this election can be symbolizing, that’s what I hope it’s a symbol of—that there is progress, and that behind the walls of the castle, things are changing, and it’s in a good way.”
Parker, who as vice president will serve as the organization’s head writer, said that she and Wilkinson are both “very excited to be at the helm” of the Lampoon.
Parker also said that she hopes that having two women leading the Lampoon will encourage other women who might be interested in becoming a part of the organization.
“My hope is that having two women in the leadership positions will  help lower any sort of barrier to the confidence of women considering [joining]..., and I think that when compers can see themselves in the leadership of an organization, that makes applying more attractive,” said Parker, an Eliot House resident, who was accepted onto the Lampoon’s staff during her sophomore fall.
With tongue in cheek, Parker said she sees the Lampoon becoming more of a “feelings place” with her and Wilkinson in charge.
“I would definitely hope that it alerts people who did not know that there are women on the Lampoon, that there are,” added Wilkinson, who joined the Lampoon’s staff during her freshman spring. “I wasn’t aware that there are certain people who don’t believe that we exist, but we do, and we are just as much a part of the organization as anyone else.”
Wilkinson’s election has caught the attention of the national media. Wilkinson was profiled in New York Magazine in January, and both she and Parker were interviewed by NPR’s Michel Martin about their election and about women and diversity in comedy more generally.
When asked what she most looks forward to about the Lampoon presidency, Wilkinson named the “presidential wardrobe” that apparently comes with the office—“I can’t wait to inherit all those sweaters,” she said, chiding outgoing president Eric R. Brewster ’14 for his choice of clothing. As for the Lampoon’s upcoming projects, Wilkinson added that there are “a lot of cool things in the works,” though she declined to go into more detail.
“There’s a lot of cool stuff that’s going to be happening, and I’m just looking forward to spearheading it and letting it happen, and seeing how people react to it,” Wilkinson said.
When asked for his thoughts on what Wilkinson and Parker will bring to the organization in the upcoming year, outgoing president Brewster merely quoted Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address: “We’re engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. And then we’re met on that great battlefield of that war.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard was among dozens of institutions of higher learning to renew and share its efforts to reach out to potential students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds last week, as a part of President Barack Obama’s ongoing initiative to make college education more affordable and accessible.
The University’s support of the initiative came despite the fact that University President Drew G. Faust was unable to attend the discussion, which was part of a summit on higher education at the White House last Thursday, Jan. 16 that attracted leaders from across academia and is a key part of the President’s emerging agenda for national education.
Faust was originally scheduled to attend the event, slated for Dec. 11, but had to change her plans after it was postponed.
“[W]e are here for one purpose: We want to make sure more young people have the chance to earn a higher education. And in the 21st century economy, we all understand it’s never been more important,” Obama said at the summit.
Among the efforts pledged by Harvard was a commitment to hire new staff in the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid dedicated to reaching out primarily to minority students. The University also plans to extend its use of social media to help inform more students.
In addition, University representatives will join counterparts from Princeton, the University of Virginia, and Yale to give joint-information sessions to students in areas of the United States that do not typically draw many applications to their institutions starting in the fall, the Yale Daily News reported last week.
The pledges are in addition to Harvard College Connection, an outreach program that the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid introduced in October that aims to use social media and other online platforms to help low-income students have better access to college admissions and financial aid information.
Other institutions, including public, private, and community colleges, offered their own pledges to not only reach out to low-income students but also to expand advising programs when students arrive on campus.
Obama noted that in addition to plans from colleges and different organizations that his administration will seek to combat the increasing costs of higher education.
“I’m going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this, but I’m also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked,” Obama said. “I’ve got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won’t, and I’ve got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission.”
Some pundits urged caution over the plans offered at the summit and spoke about the limitations and difficulties of trying to reach out and enroll more low-income students.
Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at UVA who now runs his own college consulting company and blog, noted that many colleges and universities simply do not have the funds that Harvard and other top-tier schools do to invest in financial aid.
“Harvard is a very small place that has a lot of resources, but not everybody can go there,” said Muth. “I don’t see anything saying here is money [to fund expanded financial aid].”
According to Muth, that means that in the absence of new funding, tuition will have to rise to compensate for increases in financial aid, causing certain groups of applicants, specifically middle-class students from suburban regions, to be squeezed out of a class. In addition, he said, increased socioeconomic diversity can come at the cost of other types of diversity like ethnicity.
Obama himself acknowledged the difficulties of reaching out to low-income students but said that the importance of a college education makes confronting such difficulties necessary.
“We have to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity into the middle class, and that those ladders—the rungs on those ladders are solid and accessible for more people,” said Obama, himself a graduate of Harvard Law School.

The new year brings updates to the University’s transport system in the form of an additional shuttle service smartphone application and the official expansion of weekend shuttle service, supervisor of Harvard’s transit and charter operations, Jonathan Werner, told The Crimson in an email earlier this month.
Students will now be able to use Transloc Rider, a shuttle service application that can automatically detect students’ current locations and inform them of the closest shuttle stop and the routes servicing that stop, said David E. Harris Jr., director of transit and fleet management for Harvard Campus Services. The application, which students can download in addition to the current Transloc shuttle-tracking application, also features an updated search function.
Harris said that “one of the best features” of the application is an alert function that allows students to choose to be notified when their desired shuttle is five, ten, or 15 minutes away from the stop nearest to them. The alert feature, he said, can help students ensure that they catch the next shuttle without constantly needing to check the tracking application.
According to Harris, the new features have been tailored to fit campus needs in response to extensive feedback collected by Transloc, a transit technology company that has serviced Harvard since 2007.
“It’s been a really good company to work with because we think they do a good job at recognizing the needs of students and what they’re looking for,” he said.
The upcoming semester will also see a continuation of the expanded Crimson Cruiser service that was launched in September, with the weekend and holiday morning service between Mather House and the Quad now official.
“[The extension] is scheduled and budgeted to be a permanent part of the service now,” said Harris, adding that the increased shuttle hours are the product of a student survey and discussion between Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich and Undergraduate Council members, including UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15.
Charter service for student groups traveling throughout the greater Cambridge area will also continue. Since its inception more than ten years ago, the charter service has acquired more modern equipment and grown in size, with students utilizing the service over 500 times last year, Werner wrote in his email. The charter service includes the transportation of athletic teams to Logan Airport and additional shuttles for late-night events like the annual Halloween party Heaven and Hell, which is held in Currier House.
“Groups recognize that it’s just as easy to use a Harvard bus to get around Boston or Cambridge for a special event as it is to call in an agency outside,” said Harris. “And then they also get the familiarity of having the same Harvard driver that they might otherwise see driving on a route.”

Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, along with dozens of activists, will continue a 185-mile, two-week march across New Hampshire this week to protest the corrupting influence of money in politics and publicize the need for campaign finance reform as the important 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary approaches.
Lessig’s walk began on Jan. 11 to honor the life of Aaron Swartz, a former Harvard fellow, a managing partner of Reddit, and an internet freedom activist who convinced Lessig that campaign finance regulations had to be reformed before other issues could be addressed.
Swartz, who wrote code for Lessig’s Creative Commons and worked at Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, which Lessig directs, committed suicide on Jan. 11, 2012 after being charged with wire fraud for downloading academic journals.
“He convinced me that this was the right thing to do,” said Lessig, who began advocating for campaign finance reform after speaking with Swartz. He later added, “Regardless of the issue that you think is important…what is blocking reform is the way we fund elections.”
In his march across the state, Lessig joined New Hampshire Rebellion, an activist organization for campaign finance reform.
“His walk is, I think, Lessig simply wanting to try to generate that pressure for change,” Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain in an email to The Crimson. Zittrain, who directs Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, went on to call the walk “a moving op-ed.”
The walk has drawn national attention, garnering coverage from news outlets like The Atlantic, the Huffington Post, and numerous local news stations in New Hampshire. Lessig is not a newcomer to the political spotlight. He considered a run for a California Congressional seat in 2010, has supported the idea of a second Constitutional convention to overhaul the current Constitution, and has advocated for causes like less stringent copyright laws.
Lessig previously criticized the influence of money in elections in a popular TED Talk and recent book, “Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It.”
The walk has also drawn inspiration from Doris Haddock—known by many as “Granny D”—who walked across the country at the age of 88 to draw attention to the issue in 1999. It will come to an end this Friday, Jan. 24, on the anniversary of her birth.
Lessig noted that New Hampshire was a great place to start raising awareness, given the importance of its presidential primary, but said he hoped the movement would influence voters across the nation.
“It would be great to have Granny D walks in Iowa and South Carolina,” Lessig said.
According to Lessig, the vast majority of people believe money has a negative effect on elections, but that same majority believes nothing will be done.
“If you see what Larry’s doing as...raising awareness and promoting the very idea of active citizenship, then I think he’s really on to something,” Law School professor and founder of the Berkman Center Charles R. Nesson said. “[Money in politics] is a fundamental danger to our republic in the undermining role of the citizen.”
Despite this national apathy, “time in New Hampshire has made me incredibly optimistic,” Lessig said. “What I’ve seen up here is incredible passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
University officials announced Tuesday afternoon that the University will not open until 11 a.m Wednesday, Jan. 22, as weather forecasters predict snowfall of up to or over 10 inches by the morning.
 
While second semester classes have yet to begin, many undergraduate students have returned to campus for various extracurricular activities, including the College’s fifth Wintersession, a week of student-initiated programming. Many morning events will not take place as a result of the University’s delayed opening Wednesday.
 
After a series of emails alerted students and staff that University officials were monitoring the weather forecast, an email from executive vice president Katie N. Lapp urged non-essential personnel not to report to work until the delayed opening at 11 a.m.
 
At around 4 p.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for the greater Boston area, which could see anywhere from six to 10 inches of snow. The warning, which will expire Wednesday at 1 p.m., states that snow could fall at a rate of one to two inches an hour and that gusts could reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.
 
A Faculty of Arts and Sciences emergency notification announced more specific schedule changes, some starting as early as Tuesday evening. Most libraries were closed at 5 p.m., but Houghton Library will remain open until 7 p.m. and Widener will close at 8 p.m.
 
The notification also announced that Extension School classes scheduled for Wednesday morning are cancelled, but that classes starting at noon or later will meet as planned.
 
Dining hall hours will not be affected by the delayed opening.
 
Lapp wrote in her email that the University might impose further schedule changes if weather conditions necessitate further action.
 
Other area universities have announced similar plans. Northeastern, which opened for its winter term earlier this month, will delay opening until 10 a.m. Wednesday. Evening classes were cancelled at Boston College Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in 2009, Louis Leblanc was the 18th name called in the NHL draft, taken in the first round by the Montreal Canadiens. A little more than four years later, the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year heard his name called again, this time to tell him that he’d been called back up to the NHL squad.
After a year in the developmental AHL league playing for the Hamilton Bulldogs, Leblanc will get another shot with the Canadiens after being cut early in training camp. The 6’0” right-winger/center played in 42 games for the top pro squad two seasons ago, but a high ankle sprain in October of 2012 kept him out of action and off the Canadiens roster.
Cut to this season, where in his two week stint playing for Montreal in late October and early November, Leblanc did not notch a point in five games. Though he was sent down on Nov. 5, it seems as though the Canadiens management is taking another chance on the former first-rounder, who had scored nine goals in 36 games for the Bulldogs.
The Habs sit in third in the Atlantic conference and hope Leblanc can fill the spot vacated by 19-year-old third-line center Alex Galchenyuk, who is out for at least another four weeks with a broken hand. In the meantime, Leblanc projects to get his fair share of shifts as long as Galchenyuk is out.
The past few years for the former Crimson forward have been somewhat of a disappointment. Leblanc led Harvard with 23 points in his decorated freshman season for the Crimson and recorded three game winning goals.
Rather than completing his time at Harvard, Leblanc decided to heard straight to the NHL, signing a three-year contract with the Habs. He played a year in the Canadian Hockey League in 2010 before playing in the Habs organization, posting 58 points in 51 games for the Montreal Junior Hockey Club.
