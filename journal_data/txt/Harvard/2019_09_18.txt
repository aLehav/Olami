After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Second Amendment is widely disputed for its validity in an age of automatic weapons. Seldom invoked by name in the general public, the Fourteenth Amendment is similarly relevant today — in an age where a college education is increasingly valuable, should the right to an education legally extend that far?
To be clear, the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee a right to education. In fact, no such provision is found anywhere in the U.S. Constitution. However, the amendment does guarantee equal protection under the law; it ensures that all people have equal access to public schools in the states in which they are established. Perhaps it is this ambiguity, this lack of a truly guaranteed education in any capacity, that makes the college tuition debate so difficult to tackle.
There is no denying that college tuition is astronomical. In the 2016-2017 academic year, students attending public colleges in their home states paid an average of $14,210 in tuition and fees. Noting that this statistic already accounts for financial aid and scholarships, this is a rather unreasonable expectation of young men and women at the very beginning of their adult lives. For those without families supporting them financially, such a burden is all but impossible to carry.
Therefore, members of the Harvard student body and beyond are reasonably calling for politicians to find a solution. The solution supported by many and touted by politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) is completely free, four-year college education for all. This is, in theory, a great solution and a spectacular equalizer of the American playing field. In the supposed land of equal opportunity, it seems nonsensical that a college education would not be accessible to all citizens. However, such a solution is rather impractical.
The United States faces a debt of more than $22 trillion, and does not have enough tax revenue to support its most desolate citizens. Taxes could certainly be raised, especially taxes on the wealthy, but it would take a massive increase to generate enough tax revenue to provide free tuition for all.
Furthermore, it would hardly be fair to completely eliminate college tuition and fees. There are millions of people struggling to pay off student loans — U.S. citizens currently owe $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. To eliminate tuition for the next generation would put those currently in debt at a disadvantage.
It would seem, therefore, the only way to fairly eliminate college tuition would be to cancel all student loan debt. But such sweeping forgiveness of a mountain of debt would likely demand an even greater tax increase and have negative implications for the economy as a whole.
How then, can we take steps toward a more even playing field? The most reasonable solution, for now at least, would be to guarantee free two-year degree programs. Indeed, this could create similar issues as outlined above, but on a much smaller scale. The tax-payer burden would not be as great, and yet hundreds of thousands of people who could not afford to earn degrees would have the opportunity they deserve. Further, the credits earned in these two-year programs could be transferred to four-year universities, enabling students to attain bachelor’s degrees at half the current cost. There would certainly be students who would not take this step, but they would still walk away with a higher degree than they could have otherwise afforded.
Lastly, in regards to student loan debt that is currently owed, perhaps the best solution is to allow more leeway in payments. Decreasing interest rates and forgiving late payments when deemed financially necessary would make the debt much less strenuous on those currently carrying it.
The college tuition crisis will always be relevant — accessible education for all is an ever-enduring issue. It is becoming increasingly difficult to attain a job, let alone a high-paying career, without a college degree, yet there is no equality of collegiate opportunity in the United States. With this in mind, the solution outlined above is admittedly imperfect. It is, however, practical, and practical steps must be taken to move closer to fulfilling the American promise of equality for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all its stresses, shopping week continues to be an integral part of the Harvard experience. As a Board, we never tire of defending it. This year, however, we’ve noticed some particularly glaring issues.
Firstly, my.harvard simply doesn’t work. Over the course of shopping week, students frequently discovered that they would not be able to browse courses, check class times, or complete enrollment logistics due to persistent technical difficulties. Even when the site did ostensibly function, it was brutally slow. That’s a problem. It also bears mentioning that the PDF version of the course catalog students were expected to use in its stead was both less user-friendly and filled with inaccuracies.
Unfortunately, the poor performance of my.harvard fits a broader pattern that one hardly needs software to recognize. It didn’t work this year; it didn’t work last year; and we’re worried it’s not going to work next year, either. That does not bode well for Harvard’s administration, which has been considering new ways of standardizing enrollment and lotterying procedures across courses in a consolidated online system.
The other big story of shopping week has been the new General Education requirements. These too have faced problems. To be sure, we’ve criticized Gen Eds, and even the roll-out of this particular Gen Ed system in the past, but our critique now goes still further: The new capping system just doesn’t make pedagogical sense.
Gen Ed courses are now, with few exceptions, capped at 250 students. While there are legitimate reasons to cap courses, the College’s declared reason for the change — to facilitate more in-class interactions between students of “different peer groups” — is not among them. If the College wants to make Gen Eds an opportunity for greater classroom engagement and an exchange of ideas between students of different peer groups, it should consider making them seminars. In the meantime, surely a 250-person lecture is no more conducive to substantive discussion than the 666-person General Education 1058: “Tech Ethics: AI, Biotech, and the Future of Human Nature.”
Otherwise, the caps are merely counterproductive, serving to prohibit genuinely interested students from trying something new or fulfilling Gen Ed requirements with their top choices. It seems many professors, who tried in vain to expand enrollment to their courses, are raising similar objections.
The lottery system was also extremely disorganized, with students enrolling in a lottery and receiving results for each class separately, making course selection highly unpredictable. We are glad the administration seems to understand the issues and is working on a program that would coordinate lotteries.
And while the administration ponders standardization, we’d urge them to consider instituting a universal sectioning tool. Every class has its own inventive way of sorting students into sections. All of them seem to require students to guess and pray over whether the section they are assigned to will overlap with another section to which they are assigned. In light of the administration’s longstanding argument that shopping week is hard on teaching fellows and instructors, we submit that such a tool would clarify schedules earlier for them, too, as well as students.
Still, in the midst of all this critique, we believe it’s important to praise the innovations that have worked. The revised “Advising Report” functionality on my.harvard has been incredibly helpful in students’ long term planning. That said, given that old non-Gen Ed courses are being retroactively counted toward the new Gen Ed requirements, it would be beneficial for students to have a little better sense of how these decisions are made (as well as how they can be adjusted).
There’s a lot of work to be done to make course selection at Harvard the best it can be. None of these changes necessitate getting rid of shopping week. All of them require the administration to think critically about simple and universal models that prioritize students’ fundamental desire to learn.
And we’d love it if, just for one week, my.harvard could do its one and only job.

Let me ask you a real question — you happy, bro? If the “Harvard Confessions” Facebook page is anything to go by, I’d say no. In fact, I’d throw “a fifty” on it, because you’re spending your free time reading a column called “Happiness, the New Lie” — not exactly uplifting.
Another question — have you ever been in the following situation? It’s Taco Tuesday and you’re sitting with some friends at the dining hall. Today you were actually excited enough by the prospect of a good meal to skip your regular UberEats order. Your mother, however, did not raise no fool, and, by the time you take a look at the mounds of slop on your tray, your previous optimism has given way to your more accustomed friend, numb complacency. You’re even hungry enough to give the paprika-blasted roast cauliflower florets a try.
Suddenly, one of your friends looks up at you and asks, “How are you?”
Though it is perhaps the single most common question asked at Harvard (with the exception of “Which consulting firm are you interning for this summer?” and “Do you want to pull an all-nighter and bang this p-set out right now?”), you realize you don’t know how to answer your friend. Here ensues the next installment of our weekly existential crisis.
Some smart alecks thought it would be funny to call this apparently ubiquitous phenomenon the “quarter-life crisis.” I’ll tell you what it really is — it’s you realizing you’ve been played your entire life, but not having the guts to admit it. You’re thinking, why am I still working so hard all the time? Wasn’t this supposed to be the promised land? This is Harvard, for Christ’s sake!
At the same time, your parents are probably checking up with you (and your grades), your schoolwork isn’t slowing down one iota (and there’s always that one exam you could be studying for), and you’re surrounded on all sides by good little worker bees, who hardly ever complain and are somehow always doing 10 times more work than you while still being just as insecure about their future as you are. Twenty years of schoolin’ and they put you on the day shift.
So how you are is less a subject for polite conversation, and more something you should be chatting your shrink up about (and guess what, there’s a wait for that, too!). At the end of the day, you probably just lie to your friend and pretend like your inner life is not in tatters. And since you can’t really “find the time” to talk about it with anyone, the crisis continues unabated.
Deep down, you know that you are driven by fear. Because you know what happens if you don’t do well at school? That’s right, you magically turn poor and become the embarrassment of your whole extended family. You’re going to graduate from Harvard, for crying out loud! If you can’t be rich, you should at least be famous.
When it’s 3 a.m. and you still haven’t finished the work for that 9 a.m. deadline, you sacrifice your last shred of dignity upon the altar of wealth, status, and power, confident that one day all your propitious offerings will have the deities of capitalism smiling down on you and you’ll know you’ve earned your spot in heaven on earth. The fact that you’re miserable hardly matters when you are quite literally the chosen one.
Now, I know I’m preaching to the choir when I say that people at Harvard have a genius complex, but think about it — what if you didn’t need to work so damn hard all the time? What if “How are you?” became an invitation again instead of being this looming accusation you’ve spent your whole life walling yourself off from?
Think about your expectations for life: What would it be like if you worked a “simple” job, like a firefighter, or a librarian, or a bartender? Would it really be as disappointing as you think? Why do you keep telling yourself you need to become a CEO, or a super-prestigious doctor, or the next big thing in politics? If you really think any of that is going to make you happy in the end, you should really be asking: How is that different from where I am now?
You know, folks, I’ve heard it’s lonely at the top. And I can tell you for a fact it’s lonely on the way up, too. Hell, I bet if you stopped for half a second and chatted with one of the many homeless people out along Massachusetts Ave., they’d tell you it’s lonely out there, too. Money won’t buy you happiness for one simple reason — nothing can. And I’ll tell you one thing that beats the hell out of happiness — truth. So next time somebody asks how you are, tell ’em. You might just learn something, you insufferable nerd.

Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital is cancelling a $150,000 contract with United States Customs and Border Protection to provide consultations to medical physicians at the border, a spokesperson said Tuesday.
“[Michael J. VanRooyen] had a consulting contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regarding necessary medical services for children arriving at the border,” Mark Murphy, Brigham and Women’s Hospital spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
VanRooyen, the chair of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, had initially entered into the contract to provide medical expertise to doctors operating at the U.S. southern border where overcrowding has led to poor living and medical conditions.
“Dr. VanRooyen canceled the contract after his contact at CBP left the organization,” Murphy wrote. “Dr. VanRooyen’s expertise was not sought as a result of this contract and there were no financial transactions.”
Customs and Border Control requires consultation with an emergency medical professional to develop medical screening protocols for officers that detain individuals at the border. Doctors who specialize in humanitarian or pediatric medical triage techniques in particular are required for the development of these protocols.
When the contract was first awarded in June 2019, confusion arose surrounding the initial allocation of the monetary award to the “President and Fellows of Harvard College” — the University’s title in legal proceedings — rather than Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The error was later acknowledged and corrected to make clear the money was designated solely to the hospital.
This correction was finalized June 17, and lasted roughly three months, though it is unclear whether VanRooyen ever provided any services.
Outside of his post at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, VanRooyen also serves as the director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. He has worked to provide aid in many various medical emergencies including the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. He has worked with organizations including the American Red Cross, Save the Children, and the World Health Organization in his humanitarian efforts.

Leverett House Resident Dean Bilal A. Malik will step down from his post at the end of the semester, according to an email he sent to House residents Monday evening.
Malik’s departure from the House comes halfway through his fifth year as resident dean, a position he held temporarily for an additional year prior. Before stepping into the role in 2015, Malik served as a Leverett tutor, associate director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, and assistant dean of Harvard Summer School.
Each of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses employs a resident dean to advise students on personal or academic difficulties and represent students on the Administrative Board — a College disciplinary body.
Malik first moved to Leverett House in 2007. He wrote in his email that he decided to leave mid-year in order to move closer to his family in Pakistan.
“This community has been my family for more than a decade now. However, I also have family in Pakistan, and my wife and I feel that it is important to be closer to them at this particular point in our lives,” Malik wrote. “Our plan is to move to Lahore, Pakistan, in December after the end of fall term.”
He added that Leverett became his home over the past 12 years and thanked former Leverett Faculty Deans Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Ann B. Georgi, known to many Leverett residents as “Chief” and “Coach.”
“My childhood was marked by moving across Pakistan because of my father’s job, and then I moved across continents when I immigrated to this country,” Malik wrote. “Living in Leverett was the first time I felt I truly belonged, and I feel deeply indebted to Chief and Coach for welcoming me to this community more than twelve years ago with their characteristic warmth and love.”
Malik's announcement came just days after Leverett residents aired concerns about restricted common spaces and a dearth of social events under the leadership of current Leverett Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras in emails and a public document. In a Google Doc shared among undergraduates, students detailed their grievances and discussed bringing them to House management. Farrell and Ferreras assumed their roles in fall 2018.
Leverett student Steven T. Elliott ’22 said he will miss Malik’s guidance next semester.
“He seemed like a great resident dean, super wise, seemed super caring,” Elliott said. “I’m really sad to see him go, honestly.”
Leverett resident Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20 said he has worked closely with Malik through the House Committee and that he valued Malik’s contributions to the House’s institutional memory.
“The House will certainly miss him,” Sorkin said. “I think he’s one of the last remaining holdovers of institutional Leverett memory — like, people who have been here a long time.”
In addition to his role in Leverett, Malik lectures in the Anthropology department and has taught seminars on education and Islam.

After fielding “concerns” about the College’s joint concentration program, administrators plan to convene a student-faculty group to review and possibly change the system, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh.
Claybaugh first announced the creation of the group — a subcommittee of her office’s educational policy committee — in a welcome email to students earlier this month.
The subcommittee has not yet begun its work and the office is still working to appoint members, Claybaugh clarified in an emailed statement last week. She added that its review may encompass not only joint concentrations, but also other issues students have faced regarding concentrations and secondary fields.
“The subcommittee will be consulting with the departments and with students, to get a full range of perspectives,” Claybaugh wrote.
In 2017 — the most recent year for which data is publicly available — 371 College students, or seven percent of concentrators, pursued joint concentrations. Seniors with joint concentrations ordinarily must write a thesis that integrates the two fields.
Six departments, including Economics, Applied Mathematics, and Psychology, ordinarily do not allow joint concentrations.
Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron said his department stopped participating in joint concentrations in part because it posed challenges of “extra confusion and paperwork.” He said students sometimes struggled to juggle two different advisers across departments.
“That often left students caught between advisers with fairly different perspectives — Psych versus Ec, or Government versus Ec, or whatever it was,” Miron said. “It led to unhappiness and frustration for the students who were trying to satisfy two different advisers who had very different views on the way a thesis should be written, what type of work it should incorporate.”
Some students said the thesis requirement limits available joint concentration options even further.
For instance, Jayant R. Gopalan ’20, a joint Mathematics and Philosophy concentrator, said he originally hoped to pursue a Comparative Literature and Mathematics joint concentration, but was informed that writing a thesis synthesizing the two would be prohibitive.
“They discouraged it pretty strongly,” he said.
Multiple students pursuing joint concentrations said they relished the ability to study two topics of their choosing and particularly liked the fact that both fields of study would appear on their diplomas. Nonetheless, they said there are concrete steps that the College could take to make the process easier for joint concentrators.
Jessica A. Eng ’21, a Statistics and Folklore and Mythology concentrator, said she wishes the College devoted more resources specifically to joint concentrators. She cited concentration events that take place during freshman year, noting that these events usually have booths for each concentration but lack any for joint concentrations.
Gopalan suggested creating a centralized location for accessing requirements for joint concentrations.
“The information is definitely all available,” he said. “But it's sometimes a little bit hard to find.”
Such barriers have prompted some students and faculty to call for the adoption of a double concentration system, under which students would obtain two separate degrees without pursuing a thesis that integrates both.
Miron said he and others in his department have been “ardent advocates” for adopting such a system over the past several years.
“You might be honors in one but not honors in the other, you might write a thesis in one or even separate theses in both or neither,” he said. “There would then need to be no communication between the two fields, no connection.”
Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said she expects the Committee on Undergraduate Education — of which she was a member last spring — will prioritize the issue of double concentrations this semester.
At least one candidate for the Council — Alexa C. Jordan ’22 — is centering her campaign on pushing for double concentrations as well as double secondary fields.
“I think that we should have more say into designing what our degree is going to look like,” she said.

The Harvard Management Company — the University’s financial arm — has signed onto the Climate Action 100+, a group of investors committed to pushing greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change initiatives, Harvard announced Tuesday evening.
The new initiative provides investors the opportunity for “direct engagement” with companies that are among the highest annual industrial emitters, such as oil and gas companies, according to a press release. Some of the goals of the Climate Action 100+ initiative include cutting carbon emissions and improving disclosure of any carbon-related fiances.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the release that Harvard has created “another significant channel” to counter the issue of climate change.
“Harvard has a critical role in tackling climate change, starting with the far-reaching efforts of our faculty, students, and staff to understand the impacts of climate change and to devise technologies and strategies that can accelerate the transition to cleaner, greener energy,” Bacow said. “In joining Climate Action 100+, we create another significant channel for engaging with companies around the imperative to adopt sustainable practices and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
The University’s announcement comes amid continuing calls for the school to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. Despite criticism from Harvard students, faculty, and staff, Bacow and members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — have remained steadfast that Harvard should not use its endowment to deal with climate change and should instead engage with companies in which it invests to address the issue.
Launched in December 2017, Climate Change 100+ includes other university endowments like that of the University of California system’s — which announced Tuesday it would make their $13.4 billion endowment “fossil free” by the end of September.
William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Corporation, said in the release that joining the initiative will allow the University to collaborate with other investors to address emissions issues.
“We are hopeful that, together with our partners in this important initiative, we can help catalyze measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of companies across the globe,” Lee said.
Signing onto the Climate Action 100+ buttresses other climate change conscious initiatives HMC has developed over the past several years. In 2014, HMC created its Sustainable Investing Policy which provided an overview of how to integrate environmental, social, and corporate factors into their investments.
HMC also signed onto the Principles for Responsible Investment — a United Nations-supported organization for investors to consider integrating environmental, social, and governance considerations into investments.
Kathryn I. Murtagh — managing director for sustainable investing at HMC — said in the release that HMC was “excited” to expand the company’s efforts to engage with other investors in the Climate Action 100+ program.
“For the past five years, we’ve seen firsthand from our collaborations through the Principles for Responsible Investment — on issues such as climate change lobbying and methane gas emissions — that engaging directly with corporations can affect significant positive change in their operations,” Murtagh said.

A truck driver fatally struck a female pedestrian in her 60s early Tuesday morning on Brattle Street in Harvard Square, according to a statement released by the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
At approximately 6:53 a.m., officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to a report of a pedestrian who was hit outside the Out of Town News kiosk, located at the heart of Harvard Square. The pedestrian, who had sustained serious injuries from the crash, was transported to a nearby hospital where she was later pronounced dead, per the statement.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s Office wrote that the pedestrian was hit while trying to cross the street, and that she was not in the crosswalk. The investigation remains ongoing, and no charges have been brought against the driver of the truck, who remained at the scene. In an emailed statement, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick identified the truck as a Waltham Lumber boom truck carrying sheetrock.
The incident halted movement in the Square throughout the day as police closed the intersection of JFK Street and Brattle Street to traffic. Passersby stopped to observe the crime scene, which police barricaded with yellow tape. The truck remained in the Square until the early afternoon.
Alisha M. Candelora, who arrived in the Square a little after 10 a.m., said she observed the scene unfold.
“It’s been crazy,” she said.
By 2:30 p.m., police had removed all barricades from the area and traffic proceeded through Harvard Square.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s Office wrote that no further information will be released until the victim’s family is notified.

Despite organizers' efforts to reschedule, the 27th annual Cambridge Carnival will not occur this year due to heightened safety concerns.
The Cambridge Carnival — an annual costume parade and celebration of Afro-Caribbean culture — was originally scheduled to occur Sept. 8. But just over a week before the planned date, the city and Cambridge Carnival organizers released a joint statement announcing the cancellation.
“The safety of the Cambridge community and those planning to participate in this event or any Cambridge event is paramount and will always serve as the highest priority as it pertains to making difficult decisions like this,” the statement reads.
The decision shortly followed a series of shootings — one of which was fatal — that occurred within 10 hours of each other near Boston’s Caribbean Carnival Parade on the weekend of Aug. 24.
Cambridge Police Department received “specific information” pertaining to possible gun violence at the event, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick, though he declined to identify the source of the information. He reiterated that safety is the department’s top priority.
“You’re never able to necessarily guarantee safety.” Warnick said. “But again, due to the information that we had, and with our priority in terms of making sure that everyone would be safe, the commissioner made that decision.”
Carnival organizers met with City Manager Louis A. DePasquale Tuesday to discuss the future of the event. According to Carnival President Nicola A. Williams, the city manager and police commissioner could not reveal further details surrounding this year’s safety threat.
Williams said she is concerned that the cancellation of Cambridge Carnival might direct a message of exclusion to the Afro-Caribbean community.
“How do I, as the leader of the carnival, explain to the community that I don't have too many answers?” she said. “When black and brown people at a national level are feeling squeezed out, pushed out, and being told to go back to your country… it’s hard.”
Williams said, however, that the meeting led to a productive discussion about the importance of preserving Carnival in future years. She added that the 2019 Somerville HONK! Festival has invited Carnival to participate in its event in October.
In a Monday City Council meeting, several residents spoke in support of the Carnival. Drucilla Edwards, a member of the Cambridge Carnival committee, said the cancellation affects not only participants but the vendors as well.
“This event truly impacted everybody, especially those vendors who contributed a lot of time and money into this event and lost money in this event,” she said.
City Manager spokesperson Lee Gianetti wrote that rescheduling the outdoor carnival to its rain date would not be possible due to a continued threat of violence. He also said the city is working with the Carnival committee to organize an alternative indoor event.
“While we support, and will continue to support the Cambridge Carnival, the City will not put the safety of our residents, parade participants, and spectators at risk when we are aware of such credible and concerning information,” Gianetti wrote.

The Harvard women’s golf team looked on as the men’s team dominated the field at the Ryan T. Lee Memorial to open the season. One week later, the women teed off at the Dartmouth Invitational to start their own campaign. The result: even more Crimson dominance.
The group tallied a combined score of 576 over the two-day event to easily secure a victory. Stetson, sitting at 14 shots back, came in second, while Yale rounded out the top three.
“I think it was a super special two weekends really, for the girls and guys, for both of us to go out and win the first tournament of the season,” sophomore Chloe Royston said. “It definitely makes you feel good for the rest of the semester. We’ve all worked really hard on our games… It’s good to get the affirmation that what we’ve been doing is working.”
The performance was a complete one, as Harvard was in control for much of the tournament. After the first day the group held a narrow two stroke advantage at the top of the table. However, this lead blossomed on Sunday as the team combined to shoot eight-under par, effectively running away with the win.
“We were definitely practicing a lot going into the event,” sophomore Anina Ku said. “It was nice to have a tournament two weeks in, so we had two weeks of really solid practice. We knew we were playing well going in, but we were pleasantly surprised by how well we performed.”
Given the team victory, it is no surprise that the Crimson made its mark on the individual leaderboard as well. First-year Meiyi Yan finished in 10th place in her collegiate debut. This was highlighted by a two-under par second round.
Ku, the New Jersey native, carded a total score of 142, landing her in third place. This effort included a team-best seven birdies on Sunday.
“I had a lot of birdies… That was really important because it’s a tricky course,” Ku said. “I made some mistakes, but because I had a lot of birdies I was able to even it out and even come in under par. I definitely think for all of us, myself included, all the things we worked on leading up to the season paid off.”
That being said, Royston was the one to steal the spotlight with a historic performance. After the first day of play she found herself in second place, three shots back of Yale’s Ami Gianchandani. However, Sunday would belong to Royston.
She poured in six birdies to go six-under par for the day, and eight-under par for the event as a whole. This propelled her to the top of the individual leaderboard for her first tournament win. Furthermore, Royston’s final day score of 66 is tied for the best single round score in program history.
“Everything seemed to feel really good,” Royston said. “My putting was great. I made some clutch putts early on which definitely helped. The first round was pretty solid and the next round I went low. I didn’t have any bogeys [the whole tournament].”
This team victory is an ideal way to start the season, as it will surely boost morale and confidence. The group will look to continue its momentum in the remaining three fixtures this fall. Harvard will compete in the Princeton invitational before hitting up the Yale Invitational and UD Lady Blue Hen Invitational to wrap things up.
“[The victory] feels good,” Ku said. “We’re super motivated by it, and now we’re looking at every tournament for the rest of the season, and we’re going in as if we have a really good chance.”

Freshman fall is filled with bitter doses of reality for everyone, but perhaps the hardest pill to swallow is the fact that you aren’t the only former class president in your yard. Many try to combat this by reliving their high school glory on the college stage. Even if you, like most of us, didn’t know what the Undergraduate Council was before this race started (and still aren’t quite sure), you are no doubt very well acquainted with the faces and ideas of every ambitious future politician in your yard. Here are some of the types of candidates you’ve probably already met:
The Overly Relatable
This candidate’s platform: They just get you. Freshman year is hard: They know because they’re a freshman, too. However, they’ve survived the first month unscathed and are ready to support you in all your emotional endeavors. Sure, they might have only eaten in Annenberg twice, and they go home every other weekend because their family lives in Boston. But they promise they can turn Harvard into a replica of your hometown if you just give them your vote.
Unlimited Poster Budget
How did you spend your high school tutoring money? Well, this candidate spent theirs at Staples last weekend, printing 200 copies of their face and laminating every last sheet so that the posters will last longer than their love for the UC. Prepare to be accosted by mediocre puns everywhere you turn in your dorm for the rest of the semester (unless you’re willing to put in the effort of taking them down).
GroupMe Guru
You didn’t think much of this candidate until they started popping up in every single group chat you’ve joined since Visitas, espousing their platform and asking you to become a politically active citizen. How is this candidate in Matthews, Greys, and Weld, you may ask? The answer is simple: they’re not. But don’t bother calling them out: This candidate has the follow-through to win, and you’ll regret your ill-fated hilarious roast in three months when you can’t get funding for your club.
Doors on Doors
Thought your summer campaign internship was grueling? Wait until you meet this candidate, who is running a one-person canvassing operation throughout your entire yard. Be careful not to act too friendly towards them — they’re on the lookout for recruits, and your smiling face would make the perfect addition to their team.
Between your inbox and your dorm bulletin board, it’s hard to ignore UC elections. To all of the candidates: Good luck, and we salute your hard work. To everyone else: Have fun taking down those posters for the rest of the year.
