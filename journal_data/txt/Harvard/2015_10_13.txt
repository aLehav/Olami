Every few years, a new music video takes its place in the pantheon of the most bizarre, shocking, or simply miserable four-minute segments of the human experience. Last month, Miley Cyrus, who has spent the last several years shattering expectations no one expected or asked her to shatter, gave the world a music video fit for such a pantheon: “Dooo It!” The work, which Billboard generously praises as “performance-arty,” has amassed 11 million views in its historic month of existence. That so many people have already had the opportunity to witness, indeed, to be changed by, “Dooo It!” is truly one of the great and terrible powers of the internet.
The video begins with an extreme close-up of Cyrus’s mouth as she professes her love of various indulgences. It ends with one, too, but the “bookends” effect doesn’t really hold, perhaps because the rest of the video’s four minutes and 26 seconds is also comprised of extreme close-ups of Cyrus’s mouth as she professes her love of various indulgences.
What’s in between, however, is not simply a loop. As Cyrus pours and rubs various liquids and substances to her face, the video subtly but unmistakably progresses: the cuts are shorter, the lips are wetter, the substances are increasingly viscous, sugary, and mysterious. Cyrus does not merely lip-sync and blow smoke rings: She leads the viewer on a head-spinning descent into grime, shock and debauchery. Even more impressively, so close are the shots that she does this exclusively with her nose and mouth; not even Anne Hathaway in Les Miserables could pull that off, though, in Hathaway’s defense, she was working with shoddier source material.
As critics have followed Cyrus’s career, they have often picked the low-hanging fruit, noting the irony of Cyrus’s aggressively public bacchanalia in light of the ingratiatingly wholesome persona forced upon her in her Hannah Montana youth. Having noted the cliche, viewers shouldn’t help but feel that it would be literally impossible to get further from “The Climb” than Cyrus does in “Dooo It!” Gone are the white-toothed smiles; in their stead is Cyrus’s dripping tongue, messily corralling sprinkle-infused goo. The white teeth are still there, which is a remarkable feat of dental science, considering how many times Cyrus insists, “Yeah, I smoke pot!” Gone are the hooks and catchy choruses; the musical structure of “Dooo It!” calls to mind a train that, as it approaches full speed, jumps the rails and takes three minutes to come to a complete stop, snaking wildly through the countryside and leveling a small settlement in its wake.
Gone, too, is the insidiously virginal patriotism. More forcefully than ever, Cyrus has abandoned the cheery optimism of pre-recession America. Hands up, they’re playin’ her song—and she knows we’re not gonna be okay. If you look closely enough, given that you have the stomach to do so, you can probably see the seven deadly sins represented. Perhaps in “Dooo It!,” Cyrus, like John Doe in that one Fincher flick, merely holds a mirror to her morally empty society. If we recoil in horror, it is hardly the mirror’s fault.

What could be more chaotic than 10 (or 11) middle schoolers lost in the woods with a bear on the prowl? It is up to the lead characters of “Mike and Micah Lose a Bunch of Kids in the Woods,” an original play, to find out. The play, which will run Oct. 16-Oct. 24 in the Loeb Ex, hopes to present a uniquely comedic take on the classic coming-of-age story.
Written and acted by Mike C. Ross ’16 and Micah U. Leslie ’16, the play tells a story of two summer camp counselors, also named Mike and Micah. “We have these middle schoolers, and we have these two friends who have been friends for life and now they’re graduating college,” Ross says. “They’re about to go out into the real world, and they’re having their little quarter-life crises about that. But they're also comparing that to the last time they felt so upheaved and disgusting and weird, which was middle school.” The two friends lose the children they are supposed to be in charge of, and the plot proceeds—somewhat unintentionally—in the style of Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” which Ross had previously read. Julia N. Becerra ’16 rounds out the cast as a variety of animals, including a bear.
The cast hopes that the play will address themes of coming of age and dealing with the responsibilities and challenges of growing up. “It’s this idea of as you’re growing up, no one feels like it’s going at a comfortable pace…. You always feel like you’re being hurtled into the future. You’re never quite as prepared as you want to be,” says Karen L. Chee ’17, director of the show. “The play really explores the fear of it and how vulnerable you feel, and how everybody’s trying to cover it up and prove that they’re in a good place, but nobody really is and that’s totally okay.”
The production team believes the subject matter will be humorous and relatable not only to Harvard students, who are at a similar stage in life, but to anyone who finds themselves at a crossroads. Although viewers of the play may not be faced with bears or missing children, the cast hopes that their characters’ struggles will strike a chord. “Every time your life is about to change in some way or another, there’s definitely this feeling of fear and uncertainty,” Leslie says. “The play doesn’t take itself super seriously, and I think we were able to do a lot of weird, funny stuff, but still put out this message that we think about a lot.”

Smartly set in the 1940s and bolstered by excellent performances, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Much Ado About Nothing” bursts with comic energy as it provocatively explores the issues of gender in Shakespeare’s text. “Much Ado,” which runs Oct. 9-Oct. 17 in the Agassiz Theater, succeeds in bringing out both the play’s hilarity and complexity in full force.
Director Allegra C. Caldera ’17’s choice to set the play immediately after World War II is natural: The characters have just returned from a war, and the costumes, designed by Julia T. Thomas ’17 and Rachel R. Martin ’18, are instantly appealing. In addition to these atmospheric effects, the setting allows Caldera to more powerfully underline the gender dynamics in the text. The postwar context adds nuance to the “merry war” between longtime friends and verbal rivals Benedick (Eli J. Kresta ’16) and Beatrice (Kier W. Zimmerman ’19), and transforms the enraged rants of Claudio (Nick D. Hornedo ’19) and Leonato (Nathaniel J. Brodsky ’18) about soiled virtue from antique Shakespearean concerns about honor into a caricature of all-too-relatable modern misogyny. Beatrice and Benedick’s denunciations of marriage and the other characters’ insistences that they will eventually marry particularly resonate when considered against the era’s conflict between social upheaval and lingering conservatism.
In a simple, effective change, Don John (Ali L. Astin ’19), the wealthy antagonist, is played by a woman. In her first scene, the black-clad Don John orders her servant Borachio (Henry M.N. Brooks ’19) to pick trash off the ground by simply clearing her throat, and a wordless Borachio obliges. From the near outset, this creates an acute awareness of how the rest of the play upends and parodies outdated gender tropes. By placing a villainous woman at the center of the titular ado, Caldera brings pointed attention to the gender-driven relationships in the play, which are further accentuated by the looming social changes of the ’50s and ’60s.
Rather than seeming glaring or forced, the update effectively directs attention to the actors and to Shakespeare’s hilarious text. Although the costumes and music are distinctively ’40s, the set, by Trevor A. Mullin ’17, and lighting, by Alice F. Berenson ’16, are straightforward. The staging rarely strays outside the traditional: The actors only leave the stage twice. In a somewhat puzzling decision, though, Hero (Madi E. Deming ’18) presides above the events of Acts IV and V during which she is rumored dead; perhaps intended to remind the audience that Hero is not, in fact, dead, her presence distracts, though it does not disrupt. Caldera fares better in her staging of Beatrice and Benedick: In their sparring, they usually face each other across the stage and slowly approach each other, heightening their friction and sexual tension.
The actors are the production’s greatest strength: With wit and bustle, they create laughs both with and without Shakespeare’s text. In particular, Astin’s Don John is marvelously surly, and Hornedo impresses as a boyish, emotive Claudio. In the show’s funniest scene, Hornedo, Brian A. Cami ’19, and Brodsky (as Claudio, Don Pedro, and Leonato, respectively) loudly—and falsely—gossip about Beatrice’s love for Benedick as Benedick, played by a quick, commanding Kresta, bumblingly hides himself to listen. The actors gleefully ham it up as Kresta frantically leaps across and below the stage, knocking over set pieces. The entire show is characterized by this slapstick-happy energy of the supporting cast, and their sense of fun is contagious.
Many a scene is stolen by Jacob W. Roberts ’19 as the malapropism-given constable Dogberry. Followed (hilariously slowly) by his elderly assistant Verges, played by a double-cast Cami, Roberts takes Dogberry’s pretentiousness and ineptitude to outrageous levels, manifested in larger-than-life expressions, gangly movements, and piercing screeches. When Verges’s cane broke, apparently unexpectedly to the actors, Roberts’s frenzied absurdity and Cami’s obliviosity turned the mishap into one of the show’s funniest moments. In the court scene, in which Dogberry repeatedly howls Borachio’s accusation that he is “an ass” so it might be recorded, Roberts’s outsized presence is so entertaining that his castmates struggled to contain their laughter.
In the play’s final moments, the characters pursue Don John and Borachio through the audience, with period music heightening the mock suspense in an homage to ’40s crime movies. For this “Much Ado,” it is a fitting conclusion: theme-appropriate, chaotic, and, above all, joyous. Although the HRDC’s “Much Ado” adds thought-provoking dimensions to the play’s themes of gender and marriage, it centrally seeks comedy. In both respects it succeeds admirably.

Nobel Laureate Kenzaburo Oe is a master of semi-autobiographical novels, books in which his recurring protagonist and narrator, writer Kogito Choko, seems at times indistinguishable from the author himself. In Oe’s newest novel, “Death by Water,” Choko is planning his own final novel—also to be titled “Death by Water.” Though Oe’s novel touches on a number of staple Oe topics like trauma, marginality, and nationalistic politics, the central aspect of this book is his exploration, through Choko, of the challenges of concluding an artistic career in old age. Oe and Choko both use the title “Death by Water,” a reference to T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” to represent the slow decay of an author’s mind. Oe expresses this in both the physical decline of the characters and the stylistic deterioration of Choko’s own writing across most of the novel in an adroit move that risks losing momentum but, due to its expert handling, still succeeds.
Oe writes so tantalizingly close to his own experience as a novelist, even citing his own titles as Choko’s, that he blurs fact and fiction. Despite such similarities between novelist Oe and character-novelist Choko, however, it is important to see past biographical fallacy to appreciate the work. Choko believes that, with this project started, his “life as a novelist might soon be approaching its end,” but “Death by Water” is not in fact Oe’s last work. Instead, the novel considers with a critical and retrospective eye the particular semi-autobiographical style to which Oe has become habituated and vaguely hints at a more energetic novel to come.
As Choko flounders and finally stalls while trying to write his final novel, Oe represents this by giving his narrator-hero a dense style that comes off as wooden—a difficult-to-read but necessary and well-chosen device for completely depicting a writer’s losing touch. Since the beginning of his career, Choko has hoped to turn his father’s drowning into a grand final novel, but finds, when going through his father’s papers, that everything of value has been thrown out. With nothing to work with, Choko stops narrating events with clear descriptions and Oe drags out his hero’s thoughts into lifeless block paragraphs, in long dialogues that feel more like an extended series of bad oral presentations. His sister gives multi-page speeches in which the only indications of emotion are implausible assertions that she “was never as moved as [she is] right now.” Dialogue is dominated by a mode of literary conversation that bulldozes through Choko’s novels—which are clearly Oe’s own—in a rush to get at some elusive “meaning.”
The terror of a literary career’s end is not just unproductive stasis, however, but also the brain’s decay and the loss of originality. One of the novel’s chief accomplishments is cleverly depicting the morbid fear of plagiarizing oneself. Choko imagines people pitying him for repeating his old tricks: “Oh look, the poor old thing is plagiarizing himself—again!” But Choko reuses the device anyway. The fear of such obsolescence haunts the novel. Choko interprets a T.S. Eliot line, “these fragments I have shored against my ruins,” as representing spiritual and mental ruin, adding that with “his own mental and physical faculties…perceptibly disintegrating with every passing day” he is “not sure how to go about shoring” anything up. Oe excels at implying the terror of such an experience.
Oe slyly shifts the focus of the novel from the story Choko hoped to novelize—his father’s drowning—to descriptions of Choko’s own mortality. Distressed by his novel’s failure, Choko suffers a massive attack of vertigo, remaining bedridden for much of the story. Several chapters consist of letters to Choko from his sister; the invalid is too weak even to reply. “Death by Water” almost seems to be killing Choko. As Choko had planned to write his father’s death through the lens of a section in Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” “Death by Water,” which imagines a sailor, Phlebas, drowning at sea. But “Death by Water” ends with a reminder to listeners who “consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you” to remember their own mortality. The darkly humorous suggestion is that perhaps Choko cannot write his father’s story because the only death by water that he—or Oe—should be writing is his own.
The author’s representation of lifelessness in Choko’s style makes for rather difficult reading. Oe is too engaged in meta-analysis of his own work, however, to be shaken by any such criticism—he simply writes that in as well. Choko is frequently mocked for writing such unpleasant prose. One critic calls his work “serial slices of thinly veiled memoir” and a “solipsistic and narrowly circumscribed world.” “Everything you say is true,” Choko replies. Oe anticipates every criticism of his work, whether of his prose or his intensely autobiographical style, and explains through Choko that without these techniques, he “wouldn’t have been able to write anything at all.” As he fails to tell his father’s story, however, they have become as much a trap as they are a tool. But no one is more aware of those limitations than Oe, who meets them head-on with the confidence of a truly great writer.
Oe’s imagination of the end is not all doom and gloom, however, and the final section of the book features a hopeful turn in tone and style. As the plot shifts unexpectedly to focus on an acquaintance of Choko and her attempt to stage a sexually explicit and politically controversial reinterpretation of a folktale, Oe revisits with energy and purpose many of the topics lifelessly debated around Choko earlier. A dull discussion about the similarity between the Kanji characters for forest and flood, for instance, takes on new meaning. It is not a coincidence that Choko simultaneously begins to meditate on the radically different books some authors write near the ends of their careers. “Death by Water” is not one of those books. But as its final chapters spring to life, the novel closes with an expectation of greatness that is almost greatness in itself.

Oliver Aldort has been playing the cello since the age of six; at 21, he is now the youngest member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Originally from the West Coast, he grew up in picturesque Orcas Island, WA, and then attended the prestigious Curtis Music School. The Crimson sat down with Aldort to talk about the meaning of music, art in modern existence, and why we rarely hear classical music on the radio.
The Harvard Crimson: Is it important for you to be seen as more than just a cello player?
Oliver Aldort: Obviously music is a huge part of who I am. I’ve been playing cello since I was six, so I don’t really remember much of life before music. I do think it is important to have hobbies and a life outside of music. I just got here, so I am very focused on playing cello. But I love to take walks and spend time with friends. I love great literature…. I think these hobbies contribute to music; I think they’re all related. They’re all reflecting on life experience.
THC: The first result that came up when I searched your name is your mother’s parenting website, which brings up this stereotype of a child prodigy coached by a relentless mother. Was this the case? Was your motivation to pursue music internal or external?
OA: I asked to play cello when I was six, and I actually had to ask several times before I was given lessons. She wanted to make sure that I really wanted it. I never really thought about where the motivation came from. I was never one to be practicing five or six hours a day...but even when I didn’t want to practice, I always knew that I wanted to...be a musician. And I always had a very strong connection to music, which was a huge motivator itself.
THC: Do you think that classical music is still relevant to our generation?
OA: First of all, you can search the classical music station [on the radio] and then there is classical music playing. Obviously [it’s] not the most common thing that our generation listens to, but in a long-term sense I don’t necessarily worry about it because the great master works are so transcendent of any time and place that they will always be on the shelf, and there will always be interest in them. They’re not going to disappear.
THC: What do you think is the role of the artist in society?
OA: I think art is a fundamental human need. It is found in every culture. It’s more than the cliché that music can express what you can’t say in words. It can say things that we don’t have access to or that we wouldn’t realize without it. The great composers—if you take someone like Schumann or Schubert—what they are able to access to be able to come up with their compositions is a level of depth of feeling that most of us cannot even come close to. So if we hear that and the performer is able to empathize with that, we can have something revealed to us that we didn’t have access to.
THC: What is something non-musicians don’t know about making music?
OA: It’s totally instinctual to a certain degree. When it comes to hearing music and having a strong feeling for it, at that point it’s not an analytical intellectual process anymore…. I just try to channel what I hear through my instrument. There is a tendency to almost have too much respect for the composers. Instead of having a direct channel of feeling to the music, we take something by Beethoven, and we revere him so much that we don’t want to mess it up, so we try to “do it right,” and that can never lead to inspired music-making. Somehow, we have to find a way to have a reference point and know that what we are doing is not completely our own thing but at the same time be free with it. Otherwise, it’s dead; it’s meaningless.
THC: How do you innovate the music you are playing?
OA: It’s always a tricky balance because we as [classical] musicians are playing music that was written oftentimes a long time ago. We are trying to get at nothing more than what the composer was trying to say. That said, if one plays it too literally and does not have a certain freedom in trying to communicate, that doesn’t really go anywhere either. So somehow it’s this kind of magic of music—we somehow connect. Even though most of these people are dead, we somehow connect and feel, [even though] we have no evidence that we’re feeling what they’re feeling…
THC: What mark do you hope to leave on music?
OA: I would just hope that [after] spending a life in music, I could communicate what it was that the composers were after. I wouldn’t necessarily say that’s leaving a mark on anything. It’s a difficult question…. I think the greatest musicians are channeling the music so that the focus is not on them but on the greatness of the music, which is what we should always come back to.

“Colors are only symbols. Reality is to be found in luminance alone.” In saying this, Pablo Picasso expressed one of the messages conveyed by the Harvard Art Museums last Wednesday. “Your Brain on Art: How Does Light Influence Our Creation and Perception of Images?,” an event that attracted art and science admirers from around the Cambridge area, was an effort by the Harvard Art Museums, Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, and the Harvard Brain Science Initiative not only to explore the work of two very different professors, but also to attempt to unite both fields with a common goal or inspiration. At the event, Dr. Margaret S. Livingstone, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School and author of “Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing,” and Sharon C. Harper, a visual and environmental studies professor, shared their perspectives on how art and science can be used in conjunction to advance each individual field.
As a medical researcher, Livingstone’s main goal is to explore the neurological processes that lead to facial recognition and learning as humans grow and change throughout their lives. One of the modes through which she explores the complex mechanisms involved in visual information processing in human beings is art. “Artists have been way ahead of us in figuring these things out,” she said at the event. According to Livingstone, long before neurobiologists understood that the human brain can locate contrasting elements in an image very quickly, Claude Monet had already used darker colors to focus attention on a sun in a painting.
Livingstone’s portion of the talk began by exploring the colors, luminance, and motions that the brain perceives in artistic movements such as Impressionism, Cubism, and Pointillism and eventually culminated in the analysis of one of art and science’s greatest mysteries: why the “Mona Lisa” seems to have a different smile depending on how one views the painting. “Don’t you find that she’s smiling more when you’re looking at her eyes than when you’re looking at her mouth?” Livingstone asked the audience. By observing differences in human vision depending on the angle at which an object is seen, she found a solution that came down to a simple science: Looking at Mona Lisa’s eyes makes her smile look wider and happier than looking directly at her mouth does because receptors in the eye have varied responses to the different angles in the painting.
To complement Livingstone’s presentation, which showed how art can inform science, Harper took the stage to explain to the audience the effect of science upon art. Harper, a renowned photographer whose images incorporate various scientific phenomena, explained the inspiration behind her art using “Moon Studies and Star Scratches, No. 2,” a photo series from 2003, as an example. “My approach to art-making is experimental,” she said. For example, by making use of the effect of light upon the moon as it passes through its cycle, Harper incorporated the scientific into a decidedly humanistic artwork. But by organizing the photographs in a way that was aesthetically pleasing rather than chronological, she avoided the pure technicality of a moon-phase chart. Through the use of her own photographs to show how light changes throughout the day and year, Harper demonstrated to the audience that science forms an integral part of her artistic endeavor.
Cutting across the lines separating art and science, this presentation brought together two disparate fields to explore why human beings perceive and appreciate art in the way they do. But the talk also raised deeper questions like Harper’s about the nature of humanity’s place in the world: “How are we connected to things we cannot reach, touch, or understand?”

The canvasses in “Class Distinctions: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer,” with their umber depths and their silent figures in light, impart a timeless warmth. But as the exhibition reminds viewers, this apparent simplicity belies the artists’ attentiveness to the times. Each painting is also a depiction, assessment, and reimagination of social differences in the 17th-century Netherlands. The show, on view Oct. 11-Jan. 18 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, innovatively unites 75 superb genre scenes, portraits, and landscapes presenting individuals of different classes. MFA curator Ronni Baer obtained 73 of the works on loan from collections across Europe and North America. Nearly a third are being shown for the first time in the U.S., and additionally, several are lesser-known masterpieces from the likes of Frans Hals, Rembrandt Van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, and Gerrit Dou. Even more impressive than their novelty is the freshness of their arrangement. Neighboring works from different artists complement or complicate each other’s observations on class. Together they offer a nuanced investigation into the rise of a bourgeoisie created by global trade and a sympathetic meditation on striving to improve, maintain, or accept one’s class identity.
The exhibition flows through four main rooms with thoughtfully-placed artworks that break up each room into areas of instructive micro-narratives. It starts with “The Upper Classes” near the entrance, which features massive tableaus of nobles, rich merchants, and government officials. Next the exhibit moves to “The Middle Classes” in the large center space as it becomes a cornucopia of smaller images of guildsmen, professionals, and well-off women and families. Then the show comes to “The Lower Classes,” a smaller room with scenes of public charity-giving to the poor. The final area, “Where the Classes Meet,” includes scenes of class intersection: street musicians at the door of the rich, a country fair, and all classes skating on a winter pond. Thus the exhibition presents many insights on the macro-trend of a declining nobility and rising upstart group, though the primary appeal of these works remains their visual charm.
It is representations of newly privileged members of Dutch 17th-century society which best reflect this characteristic beauty of the golden age. Paintings of nobles are among the dimmer lights in the exhibition—with the exception of Anthony van Dyck’s magnificent “Portrait of Frederik Hendrik”—because nobles, whose social identities were assured, did not care to hire painters who would best present their image. By contrast, in Vermeer’s beautiful “A Lady Writing” and “The Astronomer,” the subjects wear the latest fashions—the astronomer, for instance, wears an imported Japanese robe—rather than traditional aristocratic garb, indicating a more recent ascent to wealth. Everyone with a modicum of income could afford to buy paintings, and the joy of having just acquired privilege animates these works: From the nouveau riche, with their arriviste pretensions so wonderfully depicted in Frans Hals’s and Rembrandt’s stout full-length heavy portraits, to soldiers, priests, and notaries, to the industrious barber-surgeons, tailors, bakers, and grocers in Dou and others, to Nicolaes Mae’s female lacemaker and Pieter de Hooch’s housemaids, and finally a well-paid prostitute, each is in turn given their industrious glow. Even paintings in the lower-class room constitute another, indirect portrait of the bourgeoisie: They feature an urban group known as the “worthy poor,” receiving alms from the affluent citizens who were recording their generosity in the commissioned paintings. The poor were always shown as a function of the upper-middle class’s self-conception rather than their own need to be seen.
On the whole Baer’s chosen works are tolerant of social climbers, even as they gently mock them. While the exhibit includes some scenes of peasants, soldiers, and poor men looking drunk and disordered, the show omits more dubious Dutch figures: rogues, thieves, wooers, philanderers, and other would-be transgressors of the class boundaries. Even the prostitute, for all the flagrancy of her bared breasts and her brandished coin of payment, looks a bit reined in; her mouth is closed rather than lewdly hanging open, and she is contained by her seated posture. The prostitute has been admitted to the company of the respectables in the middle-class room. Everyone’s pretensions are recorded, but in this exhibition, nobody’s are condemned.
While the paintings can be seen as a paean to the bourgeois, and some were certainly intended as such, they are as much a reflection on the challenges to that nascent identity. In Rembrandt’s “The Shipbuilder and his Wife,” which is the heart of the show, the slightly troubled look on the working husband’s face may be a sign of this anxiety. Not all is well in this auspicious new old world; without care, one’s hard-earned position could fall. Paintings like this capture an age whose social dynamism, if not its exact structure, poignantly reflects our own world’s complexities, gains, and losses.

It’s generally agreed upon that people are pretty lonely, by and large. It’s also generally agreed upon that people don’t like being lonely very much and are willing to go to some pretty silly and horrifying lengths to stop it. Wong Kar-Wai’s “Fallen Angels” is a movie about those lengths.
The film’s first storyline follows Wong Chi-Ming (Leon Lai), a hit-man managed by his alluring Agent (Michele Reis), whom he rarely meets in person: “Partners shouldn't get emotionally involved with each other,” he narrates. The Agent obsesses over him, cleaning his hotel rooms and tracking his movements, but always maintains a cold distance from him—”There are some people you can never get close to,” she says. “Get too close, and you'll find him boring.” This frustrated, self-defeating passion permeates the partners’ professional relationship: The Agent even communicates hits to him through newspaper personal ads.
The second storyline follows He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro), a mute, emotionally damaged young man whose main occupation is taking over shops that don’t belong to him and aggressively hawking wares to often resistant late-night passers-by—a dark metaphor for chronically unrequited love. He becomes attached to the deranged Charlie (Charlie Yeung), who is driven out of her mind when her lover leaves her for the prostitute Blondie (Karen Mok).
The two storylines intersect occasionally throughout the film—the Agent and He meet briefly in a motel, Wong becomes involved with the volatile Blondie—but they remain fundamentally separate through most of the film, reflecting the isolation at the movie’s heart. Much of the action is devoted to the pain of people leaving. In the first scene, the only meeting between Wong and the Agent we see, he terminates their business relationship. “Are we still partners?” the Agent half-sobs. When he leaves Blondie, she bites him hysterically. “I've left my mark, okay?” she screams. “You may forget my face, but you won't forget my bite.” Charlie abruptly abandons He; He’s father dies. The distraught Agent ultimately deals with her grief by sending Wong into a death trap for their last joint venture.
In short, by the end of the movie, things are looking pretty grim on the alienation-and-isolation front—characters who almost never meet are killing one another to keep relationships, no matter how tenuous, from ending. The viewer might be justified in being pretty pessimistic going into the final scenes: The ragged, still-mourning Agent is sitting in a noodle house where He gets involved in a fist-fight. She keeps listlessly picking at her noodles while figures strike each other to the ground in the background; she shows no interest in the fallen bodies when the victorious parties walk out.
He happens to be one of the bodies on the ground. He drags himself up and lights a cigarette. “We rub shoulders with people every day. Some may become friends and confidants. That’s why I stay optimistic,” he narrates. Then He and the Agent notice each other.
The final scene shows the Agent riding on the back of He’s motorcycle. “I'm about to leave,” she says in voiceover. “I ask him to take me home. I haven't ridden pillion for a long time nor have I been this close to a man in ages. The road home isn't very long, and I know I'll be getting off soon. But at this moment, I'm feeling such lovely warmth.”
This is why “Fallen Angels” is important in the final analysis. People are lonely, and sometimes they do strange things as a result—go through their partners’ rubbish bins, make people buy things from them. The movie acknowledges that this fact is a dominant, perhaps the dominant, mode for human existence. But at the end, it shows that sometimes, for a moment or two, we don’t have to be so lonely, that we can be with another person no matter how briefly; and in those moments, we feel such lovely warmth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of Netflix, social media, and smartphones that subject us to an endless barrage of communications and distractions, a book festival that attracts tens of thousands of annual guests may seem incongruous. But the Boston Book Festival proves that a love of the literary is here to stay. Boasting a cast of presenters that ranges from Margaret Atwood to Neil Gaiman, the festival is a free celebration of books with a bustling schedule. This year’s festival resides within and around Copley Square and kicks off with a short keynote address by Atwood on Friday, Oct. 23, followed by a crowded day of sessions including book discussions, writer’s workshops, and musical performances on Saturday, Oct. 24.
The festival’s history traces back to founder Deborah Z. Porter realizing that Boston was one of the few major cities that lacked a large-scale literary celebration. Gathering support from local organizations ranging from public libraries to literary groups, the project to establish a festival quickly picked up steam. The first Boston Book Festival in 2009 drew in a crowd of 10,000 people, overflowing their allotted venue. Since then, it’s grown in scope, according to Porter. Last year, the festival attracted about 30,000 visitors.
What makes the Boston Book Festival special is a focus on diversity and accessibility through novel outreach programs like “One City One Story,” specifically designed to bring the literary to those in the city who might not otherwise consider it a part of their lives. With the support of a hardworking team of staff and volunteers, this year’s festival strives to engage even more people than ever before.
Setting it apart from many other literary festivals around the country, the Boston Book Festival has maintained free admission for all attendees (with the exception of two ticketed events this year) in a move to increase accessibility to the literary world. “It’s important to me that it’s free,” Porter says. “If we were to charge $10 per session, we wouldn’t have as many people. I want to have those people.”
The motivation of maintaining free admission is to appeal to as many people as possible. “We try to appeal to a wide cross section.” Further, to continue to achieve this goal, the festival is looking to improve its audience engagement. Fresh to their lineup is a session discussing the mechanisms by which the fantasy worlds found in “Dungeons and Dragons” and “Star Wars” have “captured our collective imaginations and turned escape into an experience of community and collaboration,” as the Boston Book Festival website declares, and a literary trivia quiz. Additionally, the festival features “craft sessions,” in which successful authors take snippets of their work and dissect the thought process behind them for their audience.
Of course, throwing a large festival in the center of Boston is not free, and the organizers turn to sponsor support and donations to keep afloat. “I want the people who can afford it to give what they can,” Porter says. “The people who are enjoying the festival can help support it.”
Norah Piehl, the festival’s deputy director, also stresses that donations are a great way to help out the organization. Donors receive gifts ranging from “swag bags” to invites to exclusive cocktail parties with the presenters as thanks for their contributions. And for those who can’t donate, there is always the option to donate time instead. ”We always, always need volunteers,” Piehl says, adding that between 250 and 300 volunteers help run the festival each year.
Without the burden of an admissions fee, the festival has steadily attracted more visitors. “You end up going into all of these places you normally wouldn’t. Small churches and places like those, that’s where everything is,” Laurence A. Ralph, an associate professor of the social sciences in Anthropology and African and African Americans Studies, says of the allure of the festival. “Places you wouldn’t normally go into because it isn’t a shop or something. And then you get people shopping on Newbury Street or something coming and seeing what’s happening and becoming engaged.”
However, the actual attendance at the festival is somewhat skewed. “In general we have a highly educated audience. Our surveys show that half our audience has been to a graduate school,” Porter says. She adds that the attendees are predominantly female.
In addition to increasing audience engagement through free admission, the Boston Book Festival began a program after the first festival in 2009 called “One City One Story” to reach out to the entire city in the weeks leading up to the festival. The phenomenon of an all city read, where a single book is selected to be read and discussed by an entire city was becoming increasingly popular in large metropolises such as Boston. Considering that the demographic they wanted to target might not be inclined to purchase or check out an entire book from a library, the idea of an all-city read was retooled to an all-city short story read, Piehl explains.
Since 2010, “One City One Story” has annually selected a short story and distributed it for free throughout the Boston area. Each year’s story can be found in booklet form in locations such as the Boston Public Library, the Harvard Book Store, and even at select Dunkin’ Donuts shops. It is also distributed en masse at various events around Boston leading up to the festival. This year, the story was given out at the Latino Family Festival, the Cambridge Carnival, the Boston Local Food Festival, and many more. A total of 30,000 copies of this year’s short story “Home Movie” by Jennifer De Leon has been distributed this year—25,000 in English and 5,000 in Spanish.
The culmination of “One City One Story” is a live, town hall style discussion at the Boston Book Festival, explains Niki Marion, the “One City One Story” project manager. The audience has a chance to interact with the author of the story and as a community. “It’s very much more a community interactive experience,” Marion says. “The moderator really engages the audience. We want people to come to the discussion ready to share their thoughts and to engage with the story.”
Piehl explains that they “try to find a story by a local author that will connect with people in the city.” The first story chosen was “The Smile on Happy Chang’s Face” by Tom Perrotta. “We want something that has a high level of literary quality, but also something that will connect with a wide range of readers,” Piehl says. “It’s a challenge, to be honest. The reality of the publishing industry is that not as many authors of color are publishing as any of us would like.”
Looking forward, “One City One Story” aims to expand more into communities within Boston, especially high schools. “I’m always interested in hearing the voices of the young people who are reading—how they’re reading it and how they engage with it,” Marion says.
Beyond its wide circulation, what makes “One City One Story” special is that it takes open submissions from authors each year. This year’s author, De Leon, had submitted in previous years before being accepted this winter with her short story. Her story focusses on an immigrant family struggling with their differences in opinion as to whether or not Boston has become their home. “I think ‘Home Movie’ hits a lot of themes happening in the city right now. In terms of immigration and what does home mean,” De Leon says. “I hope this story can give people a different perspective on the immigrant experience. It’s hard to get a 360 degree view, so even if it’s just another degree, I hope it gives people a view of new experiences.”
De Leon feels like reception of her work through “One City One Story” has been great, adding that she has been contacted repeatedly by readers who connected deeply with the themes in her story. “Writers work on a laptop in their room and never think about it going out to a city of people,” she says.
De Leon has been involved in several community discussions of “Home Movie” so far, and she plans to attend as many as possible leading up to the festival. “I think the library was happy that it wasn’t their typical audience,” she says, explaining that she thinks the typical audience would be self-selecting. “The conversations we had were so rich, I sense that they are immigrants themselves or children of first generation immigrants. I think they are teachers as well, or people who work with immigrants.” She commends the portability of the booklets, and the wide accessibility of distribution, especially the choice to print in Spanish this year, which she describes as being a major component for many people picking up the story at the Latino Family Festival, which she attended.
Keeping up with new ways of reading, “One City, One Story” is offered in digital form, including PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats. De Leon, Marion, and Piehl all speak of the importance and popular appeal of having a well-made physical booklet. Despite the increasing integration of technology and digital services into our lives, those involved with the festival are not worried that printed books are going anywhere soon.
In fact, for some, the emerging prevalence of social media is a new tool to be used for the advancement of of printed books. Ralph’s most recent book, which he is presenting at the festival, is called “Renegade Dreams: Living Through Injury in Gangland Chicago.” Through his work, he has dealt with the relationship between fast moving social media and the slower paced literary world. “Social media condenses a lot of information into a headline...that [headline] can really strike a chord with people,” he says. To him, it is the role of expanding upon that headline and discussing it in depth that is in the realm of the literary.
Rosabeth M. Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School, a presenter at the festival, and recently the author of “MOVE: Putting America's Infrastructure Back in the Lead,” argues that social media platforms and books do not compete because they serve different functions. “For some people they replace books, but I think that for most people they lead them to something bigger. Old media tends to thrive in strange ways alongside of new media,” she continues, adding that that radio was supposed to be killed off by the rise of television, but instead has flourished in new ways. “The old ones don’t completely disappear, but they have to change. Change their form, change their attitude, adapt to the new technology.”
Books importantly set themselves apart from social media, Kanter continues. “It’s the book length, long form reading that I think is important to preserve. Otherwise people get their information through 140 characters,” she says. “Books are an opportunity to explore something in depth, to draw people in, and to learn more than the headline. This makes them more informed people, more informed citizens.” To Kanter, the book festival is special in that it allows people to meet authors and then walk away with a real conversation and a physical book. “A book is a way to talk to people that I wouldn’t normally meet in a conversation.”
Lisa Randall, a Harvard Professor in the Physics Department, is presenting her new book “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs” at the festival this year. “It’s an era where we worry about books,” Randall says. “I think the fear is a little overstated. I think there’s a general concern about whether people will continue to read. Both fiction and nonfiction books play a very unique role, to the extent that they can tell a story that people don’t know.”
The narrative of “One City One Story” has been one of success. “The community really appreciates what we do,” Marion says, discussing how delighted people were to see her begin to distribute the booklets around the city this year. “We know that people are excited for the story and are excited for the festival, across all of Boston and all backgrounds. It’s really rewarding to see that.”
Moreover, “One City One Story” has aided in the festival’s goal of creating a sense of community among the attendees. As a long time participant of the festival, Ralph appreciates the ease with which they can interact not only with the authors and presenters but with each other. “The festival is an opportunity to engage with people, not necessarily one on one, but in a different way than we do over social media.”
Piehl echoes with Ralph’s statement. “At the book festival people have a connection,” she adds. “30,000 people who are propelled by their love of reading or of the authors make their way into this small space. It’s really gratifying to see that sense of community around that sense of enthusiasm for the power of reading, and of books.”
More ways to while away a lazy afternoon, a solitary meal, or a bus ride to work other than read a book are invented every day, but the staff and annual attendees of the Boston Book Festival are there to remind us that books still maintain a special place in the heart of the city. “A culture has to celebrate the things that are important,” Porter says. “And this is important.”

The more retro something is, the more hipsters seem to love it. Macklemore famously summarized this when he rapped, “I wear your granddad’s clothes / I look incredible.” While some items, such as clothing or furniture, serve the same purpose whether they are labeled as vintage or not, others, such as record players and cassette tapes, have undoubtedly been outstripped by modern technology. Yet what it lacks in function the vintage object makes up for in sentiment. For the hipster, this sentiment usually takes the form of nostalgia. Ultimately the appeal of vintage rests on three main principles. First of all, it serves as a channel through which the hipster can explore and redefine her relationship to that past. This suggests a second principle, which is that the newly developed relationship to the past can be used to explore the hipster’s individuality, leading to a form of individual empowerment. And finally, the third cornerstone of vintage’s appeal is its inherent counterpoint to the mainstream, which further serves to define the hipster as both a unique individual and as a member of a unique group.
The redefinition of the hipster’s relationship to the past centers on vintage because it is a tangible representation of a given era. Through relics discovered in thrift shops or in the dusty recesses of her parents’ attic, the hipster can explore the morals, ideas, and values of a time beyond the present. By mining the past for inspiration, the hipster can assert her independence from the commonly available store of thought—the mainstream—which draws mainly upon values of the present. Thus, the vintage ideal is a temporal rebellion as well as a cultural one. However, the hipster does not simply extract inspiration from the past but arguably seeks to immerse herself in it; she carefully crafts an amalgam of the best historical moments and then seeks to redefine herself in relation to them. This exercise of communing with a lost zeitgeist is rarely done without nostalgia. Taken from the Greek word meaning “return home,” nostalgia is characteristic of much of the hipster’s relationship to the past; the present never seems to quite measure up.
However, for individuality to develop, it is necessary for the hipster to compare the present to the past, because it is this comparison that drives the hipster’s relationship to the modern world. By interacting with the present reality through a lens that is consciously derived from the past, the hipster has a basis for nonconformity and can therefore strengthen any unconventional ideals she may have. For example, when asked why they like barefoot running, many enthusiasts respond that it was the “natural” way our ancestors ran. While rationales like this are often scientifically shaky, they are nonetheless important because they provide an example for how the past can act as scaffolding for the adoption of non-mainstream beliefs—a significant part of the hipster identity. Once this scaffolding is in place, the hipster can use it to create an identity that is labeled as the complete antithesis of its mainstream, present-day counterpart.
However, if all hipsters try to overcome the mainstream in the same way, a philosophical question arises: Are hipsters truly overcoming the mainstream or merely creating a new one? And if the former is true, is the hipster the antithesis of the mainstream or instead an extension of it? While it may seem like intellectual overkill to put the onus of these questions on vintage, the reality is that the vintage object itself has no meaning unless the individual chooses to use it and in so doing chooses to explore the past. In this case, vintage is not merely an aesthetic choice but is one of the central rituals of defining hipster identity.
Complicating this ritual is the fact that vintage is not always what it seems to be. Many “vintage” items are purchased at stores like Urban Outfitters: “distressed” clothing, records pressed on new vinyl--the list goes on and on. This begs the question: if the relics of the past through which hipsters form their identities are not truly relics of the past, does that nullify the authenticity of the hipster identity? Or is the material authenticity of the items irrelevant compared to the intention of the user to commune with the past? This use of an image of the past as opposed to an actual relic of the past suggests a superficial connection that may or may not be contradictory to the hipster trope of “before it was cool.” Does this goal of being an antecedent to the mainstream mean resurrecting the past before it is rediscovered or creating the future before it happens? In a way, the hipster is a philosophical contradiction: It is for this reason that the hipster movement can only be described as a paradox. The hipster seeks to simultaneously recreate the past and “predict” the future—all the while relying on the present, the very thing that hipsters seek to supercede.

The professional actor’s toolkit contains many resources that can be helpful to everyone. One of these is rehearsals—practicing before actually giving a performance. Just as the rehearsal process facilitates an actor’s incarnation of a character and enhances the actor’s acquaintance with all components of a creative work, rehearsals can do the same, and perhaps even more, for the layperson.
A famous Shakespeare quotation comes to mind: “All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.” How do the Bard’s words manifest themselves in everyday life? At one point or another almost everyone has taken part in an activity that is completely “put on.” Political gatherings, rallies, religious ceremonies, weddings, family get-togethers, group meetings, birthday parties, and even dates are often staged and rehearsed, complete with a breakdown of roles, speeches, exact duration of scenes, specific entrances and exits, etc. Shakespeare’s words gain even more significance when people take a closer look at their individual lives. On a daily basis, most people assume different roles as they move from one scene to the next. A restaurant manager switches uniforms, becomes a pharmacist, then returns home to be a mother; a lawyer serves simultaneously as a university professor, the chairman of the board of a non profit, and the neighborhood football coach, etc. Thus, people transition seamlessly from one role to the next.
Such transition is facilitated by training and practice. While growing up, people are taught—both at home and at school—to “act” in a certain way; doing otherwise is chastised as solecism. We also learn to acquire diverse skillsets and adapt to new situations through practice. Consequently, the high school graduate—once apprehensive of college life—soon becomes a proficient freshman, and the aspiring medical student one day becomes a doctor. Human beings develop by force of training and repetition. As Mark Twain opined, “There’s nothing that training cannot do. Nothing is above its reach or below it. It can turn bad morals to good; it can destroy principles, it can recreate them; it can debase angels to men and lift men to angelship.” Twain suggests a psychological transformation in the trainee by underscoring the role of training in shifting bad behavior to good. Similarly, in his book “Awaken the Giant Within,” world-renowned motivational speaker Tony Robbins states, “The simplest way to condition something is simply to rehearse it again and again until a neurological way is created.” Robbins’ words could pertain to mundane routines, such as changing the spot where one places his or her car keys, or to more momentous situations, such as shifting one’s outlook when switching careers. Accordingly, flawed habits that have long ossified can be rectified through rehearsals. Like Twain, Robbins underlines the correlation between training and a lasting neurological metamorphosis.
Apart from normal rehearsals, many people may be able to benefit from mental rehearsals—rehearsing an activity simply by imagining it unfolding step by step. This can be useful in a myriad of situations. For example, a student torn between two careers—say teaching and engineering—may be helped by visualizing himself or herself in both roles. By imagining oneself immersed in a specific task and mentally walking through it, one can get a feel for the task without actually doing it. This process can be helpful in making important life decisions, pre-living crucial events, and assimilating multifarious skillsets. Acclaimed physical therapist Joyce R. Maring foregrounds the efficacy of mental rehearsals in her article “Effects of Mental Practice on Rate of Skill Acquisition,” stating, “When fatigue makes physical repetition of a motor task undesirable, mental practice may be an effective aid to mastery of a skill without the expenditure of significant energy.” Maring points out the relative convenience—and commensurate benefit—of mental rehearsals.
In internalizing Shakespeare’s words and borrowing the pivotal skill of rehearsals long used in the theatre, individuals may find a helpful tool for changing their lives for the better. Just as an actor envisions a scene while preparing for a performance, we can visualize the scenes unfurling in our lives and make adjustments as needed. Ultimately, rehearsals relieve stress by mitigating the factor of the unknown so that we can be more present—and more intentional—as we go about starring in the performance of our lives.

Since the day I stepped on campus a year ago, I have understood that two phrases are basically synonymous when it comes to talking about student life at Harvard: “final clubs” and “gender exclusion.” The idea that final clubs are the paradigm of gender exclusion is preached across campus. I have witnessed professors rant against the clubs as being the epitome of gender inequality, and Crimson writers deride final clubs and all they stand for.
There’s a problem, however, with the prevailing attitude on campus: by listening to the discourse, one would think that the only reason gender exclusivity still exists is because of final clubs. They are a scapegoat all problems of gender inequality are heaped upon, and their mere existence allows students to seek no further reason as to why or how gender problems are still present on campus. They are a dead end when it comes to talking about gender inclusivity at Harvard.
This is not to say that final clubs are not a huge factor in gender inequality on campus. They are. Ask attendees of final club parties about their nights, and they’ll tell you about the all-male club members hosting parties solely for dozens of females. Take a look at last spring’s Spee Club invitation to their “pajama party,” that included a link to a YouTube video featuring females in lingerie and an image entitled “Playbear,” and you’ll see that gender inequality is all too real.
But then take a step back. Zoom out on larger campus life. The Crimson has had five female presidents since 1990, and the last one served as president eight years ago. As we enter the school year, the presidents of many of the largest groups on campus are male. Men are still overrepresented in the fields of science and technology. This was highlighted in a Crimson article whose writers reported that while 18.8 percent of graduating males in the class of 2014 were pursuing engineering or technology, only 10.81 percent of females were entering these industries. Last year, Math 55a, known as being one of the hardest classes at Harvard, was all male.
And the problem is only augmented among faculty and top administrators. Of the senior faculty in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the 2013-2014 academic year, women constituted only 24 percent. While the current President of Harvard University and Dean of Harvard Law School are women, the deans of Harvard College, Harvard Business School, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Harvard Divinity School are all men. I see the clamor about final clubs on a weekly basis, but where are the never-ending articles, op-eds, or town hall meetings about the rest of these issues?
It’s time to stop pointing fingers strictly at final clubs; it’s time to have a larger dialogue about the issue of gender exclusivity. The problem persists across campus, and in order to seriously address it, we must look beyond final clubs. We must question why certain concentrations are still dominated by males. We must look at our faculty and tenured professors and try to explain why women still constitute a minority. We must deal with the gender exclusivity that is present in our daily lives, and only then, should we turn to vilify final clubs.
In late April, a Tumblr blog entitled “Hey There Harvard, I’m In A Final Club” that listed the members of the male final clubs went viral. The site’s creators stated they compiled the list and posted it to elicit “discourse with [final club members] about inclusivity issues on this campus.” Anyone who thinks the problem is going to be solved, or even that the conversation is going to productively move forward, by hunting down final club members is sorely mistaken. Just because they are partly to blame does not mean everyone else is blameless.
If Harvard students want to legitimately address gender exclusivity, let’s start by looking at our own institution and at ourselves. Then, we can turn to the final clubs and demand that they be held accountable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”—2 Timothy 3:12
Suppose there is a mass shooting somewhere in the United States and, before firing on his victims, the gunman asks them a question: what’s your religion? If they say that they are Muslim, he shoots them in the head, but if they are an atheist or profess faith in another religion, he shoots them in the leg.
Such a horrific incident would rightly precipitate a national dialogue on Islamophobia. In the coming days and weeks we would examine our culture and ourselves in an attempt to find the hatred from which the attack came. Perhaps we would scrutinize the language of articles that discussed the growing Muslim population in Europe or the growing fear about Sharia law in the US for hints of Muslims being otherized. Perhaps people like Bill Maher and Ayn Hirsi Ali, notable critics of radical Islam, would face public opprobrium and censure. Or perhaps people and public institutions–newspapers, television stations, universities–would make an effort to educate people about the dangers of religious discrimination generally, and anti-Islamic prejudice specifically. Certainly people would use the shooting as an occasion to locate and combat the bigotry that produced it.
Obviously and thankfully, an attack like that did not happen. However, last week, something remarkably similar happened in Roseburg, Oregon. A gunman, who as of my writing is responsible for 10 deaths, asked his victims about their faith, and specifically targeted Christians the way my hypothetical gunman targeted Muslims.
The massacre has predictably prompted conversations on gun control and mental health. And while these conversations are relevant and worthwhile, they seem incomplete without a conversation on anti-Christian bigotry. I am shocked that one of the central elements of the tragedy–that the killer discriminated between his victims based on their religion–has gone largely unnoticed, both by the President (whose statement did not mention the killer’s anti-Christian animus) and most of the media.
But more than shocked, I am frightened and saddened. What could have been a teaching moment that reminded us that even the ostensibly powerful can be subjected to fear and violence, and that hate knows not who is a member of the majority or the minority, has been squandered. Our collective response, or lack of one, demonstrates at best thoughtlessness, and at worst, callousness.
Someone might say that I am getting ahead of myself. The gunman, one might claim, was deranged, and one cannot extrapolate from his actions onto the broader community. That a crazy person acted to persecute Christians does not mean there is a larger problem of Christian persecution, either in America or elsewhere.
But even if this is true, which it might be, it does not explain the lack of interest in his bigoted remarks. That is, his anti-Christian motives merit attention for their own sake. In other national tragedies where the killer is undeniably deranged, we nonetheless examined his motives and tried to draw implications. In 2011, when a psychotic man killed six people and shot Representative Gabrielle Giffords in the head, people on the left jumped to blame Sarah Palin and others on the right who used battle imagery to metaphorically described her recent election. Even when no evidence existed to suggest that he was influenced by conservative media, and even when evidence existed to suggest that he was not a conservative, and even when it was pointed out that the rhetoric Palin et al. used was not unique, the anger and blame from the left persisted.
The shootings nonetheless catalyzed a national conversation on the public discourse and political atmosphere that was not wholly unneeded or unwelcome. Just because the state of politics did not cause the shootings, does not mean that the shootings could not be a catalyst to change the state of politics.
But the same should be said about the tragedy in Oregon. It is not that America is experiencing a groundswell of anti-Christian rhetoric that caused the tragedy, but the tragedy should make us think about anti-Christian bigotry. When someone, even a crazy person, murders someone in the name of religion, how can a discussion on religious intolerance not accompany it (as was the case earlier this year when an angry, unemployed man, obsessed with parking and fixated with atheism, murdered three young Muslims)?
Globally, Christians are facing violence and severe persecution. Over the summer, the New York Times Magazine ran a feature titled “Is This the End of Christianity in the Middle East?” which chronicled some of the abuses Christians face at the hands of ISIS: there are beheadings, crucifixions, and forced conversions; Christian women are forced to serve as sex slaves. Others have also documented ISIS’s systemic cleansing of the Middle East’s Christians, and their beheading of Christian children. But the persecution is not limited to ISIS.
Turkey is allowing its churches and Christian religious sites to be destroyed. Last year in Pakistan, a mob burned a pregnant Christian couple to death for allegedly violating the state’s blasphemy law. Also in Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian mother of five, has been in prison for nearly five years on blasphemy charges. In April, terrorists killed 147 at a Kenyan university, specifically targeting Christians. I could go on with examples, but the point has been made.
All four of my grandparents came to America in the wake of the Holocaust. Most of their families and communities were destroyed. The town where my grandfather came from was completely wiped out. Growing up hearing these stories has made me particularly sensitive to religious persecution. As a Jew, I believe that religious freedom is a basic good, and a foundational principle of our Western politics and ethics. Anti-religious bigotry, even when it appears to be mild, even when it appears to be isolated, and even when it appears to be occurring in some far off land, cannot be ignored. Just because Christians constitute a global plurality, and a majority in America, does not mean that violence against them or indifference to their suffering is without consequence. What happened in Oregon is not equivalent to the genocides of World War II, but I do think there is something distressing in our indifference to the religious aspect of the Oregon murders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue and stumbled on what are now the Americas. When he got here, he plundered the land, spread disease, and raped and murdered its inhabitants. On Monday, we celebrated a holiday devoted to him and his “achievement.”
Recent years have brought clamors to rename Columbus Day. This year, many have suggested a change to “Indigenous Peoples’ Day,” to commemorate the Native Americans who lost their lives as a result of Columbus’s actions; in fact, both the Women, Gender, and Sexuality department and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life refer to the day as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Others suggest keeping Columbus Day’s current moniker to remember, if not to exalt, a difficult past. We suggest both.
Christopher Columbus sparked the slave trade and helped perpetuate what many historians consider the genocide of Native Americans. In Hispaniola, he oversaw a brutal dictatorship marked by the whipping, maiming, and killing of his subjects for minor infractions. He is a symbol of imperialism and the exploitation that accompanied it. Yet he also had the gumption to take a trip never taken before, and one he had every reason to believe he might not return from. He was the first modern European to set foot on this continent, and he enabled this nation’s founding.
Columbus encapsulates a painful part of American history. Even today, hearing his name—and hearing it taught as a reason for celebration—can hurt those whose ancestors suffered his atrocities. But it would be a mistake, and a form of dangerous revisionism, to handle that pain and hurt by striking Columbus and the decision to name a day for him from the historical consciousness.
The better way to handle the hurt is to confront its cause. It would be just as insidious for students not to learn about Columbus at all as it is for them to learn he was purely and simply a hero. Instead, students should learn about Columbus with the facts on both sides included: Yes, he was a bold adventurer and explorer, but he was also a rapist. Yes, he was a murderer, and we need to come to terms with the uncomfortable fact that the United States might not exist without him. Columbus Day should be an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and an opportunity to understand a complicated figure in full.
At the same time, students should learn about the people whose lives Columbus altered and in some cases destroyed. A national Indigenous Peoples’ Day, a variation of which exists in multiple states and major cities, should not be a pipe dream. In fact, it should exist alongside Columbus Day as an opportunity for commemoration and a way of telling today’s narrative in all its complexity. After their Monday off, children would return to school on Tuesday for lessons on Columbus, the indigenous people he displaced, and the significance of both.
By creating a holiday like this, we’d start to write a new chapter for our nation rather than erase an old one. Read together, they might finally tell the real story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If she was a small idea in April, by November, Lucy had become a person—strained, muscled, and as flimsy as guilt. I knew the stiff yellow restaurant she worked at and that Chinese song about the moon she sang to mock her twinkie best friend. I knew that “The Outsiders” was the only book she’d ever really read. I knew she’d kept the same middle school copy in her pocket until the cover ripped straight off the block like an old scar. She was a virgin. She loved driving fast and killing the headlights. She was as suburban as I was. So Lucy was there, birthed from infatuation. She was my muse; she was someone I never wanted to be and someone I’d always wanted to be. Lucy was to me what Sherane was to Kendrick Lamar, what Beatrice was to Dante, what Yunior was to Junot Diaz. She was born from dust, and I loved her.
You don’t have to write to know obsession like I know obsession. You don’t have to create to know what little reward feelings provide, how your personal tragedies sound out loud, how little is left after a relationship’s dissolved like sugar in some wet and blistering heat. You don’t need a broken heart to know that there is nothing as undefined as dissatisfaction. The things that drive you to do what you do are right on the underside of your gut.
I am curious about obsession because it is so powerful yet so unquantifiable. Though it is as musical and romantic as a countermelody or midnight, in some ways, it defines existence. “Lighthead” by Terrance Hayes was the first book of poetry I’d ever bought, and in the pages, the longing was inescapable and inextricable from the intellect, because like him and all the people he writes about in his poems, like Harriet Tubman, like Tupac Shakur, like his wife, like everyone in and out of city subways—I wanted to be “oblong with longing” or “light longing for lightness” or “the devil of longing” or mixed with “solace, survival, multiple genres of longing.” Married happily and so utterly adorably, he seemed to be the expert of longing, the connoisseur of obsession. He seemed to tell me what I’d already known, that life was little more than obsessing over the past and longing for more.
But why did Terrance Hayes’s obsession win him the National Book Award, while others left people drooling at shirtless pictures of singing boys? Why do some have it so easy, to be obsessed with something that the world finds irreplaceably important? And what drives someone to examine obscurity? Why are there article with titles like “Interactions of Hydrophobia Layer Silicates with Alcohol-Benzene Mixtures I. Adsorption Isotherms,” and how is Humbert Humbert not written off as a creation of some demented, insignificant mind? I am obsessed with obsession because it is unbelievably productive. I am obsessed with obsession because it is so utterly extreme, so daringly polar, so anything other than chill, so strangely hardcore. It is hard to imagine a world that is not essentially driven by a manic longing, whether it be for organization or freedom, happiness or pleasure. I cannot believe in a world changed by apathy; I can only picture the world shattered by it.
The difference between constructive obsession and lazy longing resides in how willing you are to describe it. If I have learned anything from growing up, it is that there are major differences between how the world works and how, through analyzing articles or watching news videos, one could believe it works. Obsession lies in the space between the two because obsession never fits in with theory. The theory rushes out, and to catch up almost always fails. What you are obsessed with tells something vital about how you view the world—about where the world fails to describe you accurately, where society has not moved over enough to share space with you. There is one way to respond to such exclusion productively, especially when the matter at hand is your existence—to demand space, to describe the world yourself; to tell a story where you are the good guy; to make your obsession not only logical but a beautiful product of human experience.
I don’t believe it is necessary to describe the macrocosmic trends of cynicism or professionalism, because I am positive everyone has felt it one way or another. While some feel a consistent pressure to be cool and apathetic, others believe their interests are illegitimate. While some force themselves to obsess over practical fields, others find absolute joy in work. The trends affect everyone differently. It is more important to internalize a simple, uncritical message: be unapologetically passionate. Be constructively passionate. View your obsessions as vitally and as seriously as you view yourself, because somehow, your interests inevitably fit into the wide mosaic of global knowledge. More simply, if you are serious, you are important.
I thought of Lucy incessantly. In some ways, there is nothing sillier than intentionally believing in an imaginary girl, than getting to know someone who does not exist. But I had never been more serious about anything else. Whatever I learned from her, I knew she was going to help me write stories. And what is more political, more interesting, or more basic than a story?

It’s a Saturday night in Kenmore Square. The sky, hazy and overcast, dulls the neon bar signs brightening the street. I’m shivering and so are the bouncers in front of me. When it comes time to show them my ID, one frowns. “You’re not 21?” he asks, confused. I sigh, then stutter, and quickly tell him about my hour-long ride on the green line, about the Harpoon bottles littering the train, the lost European tourists looking for Time Square, the sticky residue. I tell him that I’m here to learn, that anecdotes are valuable. He shrugs—from empathy or boredom, perhaps—and slaps a red band across my wrist. I enter the House of Blues.
I’m here because a Facebook post promised me that there’d be an immersive installation. I’m here because I don’t know what an installation looks like, don’t know if it should look like anything at all. I’m here because I have to make an installation (Ironic, right? But Art is ironic, no?) for a show to be seen, eventually, by Real Artists.
I’m here, but it’s clear that I’m not, really. Or at least, that I shouldn’t be. I can’t quite tell what is Art and what isn’t, who’s an Artist and who’s in the audience. I don’t know if the show has started, if there was a show that needed starting to begin with.
I see a mounted painting of Marvin Gaye, one of a grinning devil with crooked teeth, another of the American flag sans stars. A large disco ball surrounded by glittery miniature replicas looms from the ceiling. Strobe lights bounce off the walls. People are chatting and sipping, walking and laughing. There is talk of “the cosmos.” Someone likens the electro-undertones to the “sound of planets being discovered.” A gray-haired lady—clutching a canvas bag imprinted “Feed Your Mind”—faces the young girl holding her hand. “Art is difficult to narrate,” she says, nodding her head.
I nod along. There’s a certain feeling I get eavesdropping on these folks in flannel and the occasional leather jacket. It’s the understanding that I don’t know why the metal rhinoceros hanging above me is Art, don’t know how to sound like I know why it might be.
It’s a strange feeling, a hurried kind of breathing, a deep longing to belong tinged, ever so slightly, with revulsion. It’s the feeling I get when I walk in and around certain spaces here—yellow buildings, rooms filled with smoke blown in bewildered faces from puffing New Yorker-bound-demigods, cheap wine spilt amidst fraying copies of Eliot’s “juvenilia.” Mailer’s, too.
It’s a feeling I’m not too keen on feeling, so I leave after snapping a few pictures of a curtain labeled “Perception in Flux.”
***
My T.F. groans, straining under the weight of the desk he hoists into the trunk of his rented truck, where a rocking chair rests. Its mahogany hue is fading, its front leg missing. Scattered on the floor alongside it are battered books with torn pages, patches of artificial turf stripped from Harvard’s football field.
We’ve just scoured the local recycling center.
My VES class often takes trips like this, and I’m still getting used to it. I haven’t quite gotten the hang of talking about Art for three hours straight, either. “Of course this isn’t for you,” I often think when discussion turns to Judith Butler and Identity, to Rosalind Krauss and The Sublime. “Maybe? No. Hah! Not quite but almost,” I usually decide.
I’m struggling, fam, I tell my professor one day as we leave studio. I’m struggling to decide what Art is and who gets to decide on this campus, if those in the yellow building—those with the Pegasus totes—do. If they should, even. If Renegade can. If we ever will. If we already are.
She takes a long drag from her cigarette and frowns. She tells me about her friends back home in Germany who don’t agree with her belief that, if an Artist’s sculpture is shipped to the moon, it’s still Art. They say Art requires validation from others, she exhales. “But I like to think my Art can exist without that.”
***
Sometimes, I wonder how silly we must look. The grad-student-architect with twelve-foot rods. The VES-thesising-senior sifting through dust. The composer-turned-Ph.D. creating an organ from a broken piano and even more broken fans. And the brown girl in the corner, rocking back and forth in a creaking chair, over there; the one without a portfolio, the one who can’t weld or tell you the difference between a matte or flat finish; the one in a paint-covered smock who hopes the splash of “Encore Teal” on her elbows and scarf is Art enough.

Early Saturday morning, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis Doyle stood at opposite ends of Harvard Stadium and a saucer-like drone traveled between them, delivering a package of Harvard t-shirts. Dozens of Bostonians and Harvard affiliates, meanwhile, looked on.
Hosted by SEAS, the Business School, and the Harvard Xfund, the event was one of the last of HUBWeek, a weeklong series of educational events in the Greater Boston area.
After opening remarks from Paul Karoff, ‎assistant dean for communications at SEAS, several companies demonstrated their current uses of drone technology.
According to Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, co-founder of Xfund, a Harvard-affiliated seed-stage venture capital founded in 2011, it was an opportunity “to show the power of engineering and entrepreneurship, through a day-long celebration of the emerging robotics industry.”
John R. Aleman, an associate aerospace engineer at CyPhy, which produces commercial drones with photographic capabilities, said that his company plans to roll out its drones at the beginning of next year for a price of $600 each. He said the drone was a essentially a “flying camera,” adding that “when your drone lands everything is ready for you to post on social media.”
Meanwhile, Paola Santana, co-founder of Matternet ONE, said the company's drones were being used to connect rural clinics with urban hospitals in Bhutan. The company has been contacted by the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Tshering Tobgay, regarding the project. Matternet ONE drones, which can each transport up to 2.2 pounds over a 12.4 mile distance, have been used in Bhutan to transport blood samples and medication.
“One of the elements of poverty is that people can not get out of the poverty cycle because they are not connected and consequently do not have access to goods and services,” Santana said. “Is there a way we can use drones to create a 21st century transportation system that doesn’t rely on roads?”

Students from the environmental activist group Divest Harvard have appealed the dismissal of their lawsuit filed against the University last November, which asks the court to compel Harvard to divest its $37.6 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry.
The appeal, filed on Oct. 5 to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, is the group’s second attempt to use legal action to prompt Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. Their initial lawsuit was dismissed by a Massachusetts Superior Court judge for lack of standing in a March hearing after Harvard and the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office filed motions to dismiss. Superior Court Justice Paul D. Wilson ruled that the students brought their activism to “a forum that cannot grant the relief they seek.” 
Despite the initial unfavorable ruling, Harvard’s climate activists are adamant about continuing their legal battle. The plaintiffs, who call themselves the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, claim in their 113-page appeal that Harvard has mismanaged its endowment by investing in “abnormally dangerous activities” and allege that Harvard is violating its charitable duties as a nonprofit by failing to divest.
Though the plaintiffs may not introduce new arguments at the appeals stage, according to plaintiff and Harvard Law School student Alice M. Cherry, the brief seeks to argue why the dismissal was unwarranted so that the case can proceed in a lower court.
“It was an error for the Superior Court judge to grant the Defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,” the appeal brief read.
University President Drew G. Faust has maintained Harvard should not divest, arguing that the University can best combat climate change through the research and work of its students, faculty, and alumni.
This time around, the plaintiffs appear to have more external support to bolster their case. The Animal Legal Defense Fund and James E. Hansen, an adjunct professor at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, have filed amicus curiae briefs in support of the Harvard students, according to a press release. In addition, the Cambridge City Council has voted unanimously to support the lawsuit.
“It’s amazing to have the City of Cambridge, Harvard’s own hometown, throw its support behind our lawsuit,” said Joseph “Ted” E. Hamilton, a Law School student, in a press release. “This shows that many people support us and that Harvard owes it to the public to divest from fossil fuels.”
The plaintiffs—who are representing themselves without a lawyer—are all members of the group Divest Harvard, an activist group particularly involved in campus protests last year. In April, they staged a week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall, and they have repeatedly protested via blockades of and sit-ins at the building, which houses Faust’s office. This academic year, though, the group has been significantly quieter, not holding any public protests so far.

Harvard College women’s groups came together Friday evening in the Science Center Plaza to host a social event, dubbed the  “[BLANK] Party” and free to all undergraduates, in hopes of fostering a “more inclusive, open social scene,” its organizers said.
“We really wanted to have an on-campus, open party where everyone felt they could own that space and see all of their friends,” said Madeline C. Hung ’16, one of the event’s student coordinators.
Hung added that having women’s groups officially host represented an important consideration, saying that parties are frequently organized by men’s groups, such as male final clubs, fraternities, and men’s cultural groups.
In publicizing the event, organizers deliberately decided to omit names of specific collaborating student groups to maintain their “shared identity as women’s groups” and “send the message that this is a party organized by female identified students for all students,” according to the event’s Facebook page.
Avni Nahar ’17, another student coordinator, said a group of about 10 women were directly involved in steering the event. Nahar added that while eight women’s groups ended up helping plan the event, an additional eight groups helped with less hands-on tasks such as publicizing.
The party was geared toward all class years, although coordinators expected mostly freshmen to attend given the event’s proximity to Harvard Yard, which houses the majority of Harvard’s freshman dorms.
Alcohol was not provided at the event.
“Because it’s a new event, we felt that providing alcohol would be one more thing we have to worry about,” Hung said, adding that extra fees for medical staff and security would have contributed to the event’s cost.
Approximately 1,500 students cycled through the party over the course of the night, according to Hung.
Hajar El Fatihi ’16, also a student coordinator, said the event was “absolutely” a success as it provided an open social space for all Harvard students, regardless of group affiliation or background.
The party was funded in part by Harvard’s Undergraduate Council, the College Events Board, the Freshman Dean’s Office, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, the Office of Student Life, and the Office of the Dean of the College.

As the University took an official holiday on Monday for Columbus Day, Harvard affiliates and local residents gathered in Harvard Yard to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day to honor indigenous cultures of the Americas and Pacific Islands through traditional dance, song, and spoken word.
"This event is to honor how indigenous people live today according to their traditions or how they survived in whatever form they can," said Caden T. Chase ’17, co-president of Native Americans at Harvard College. "This is honoring our ancestors and also to show that we still exist, and that we are still strong, and we stand together."
Posters reading "We're Still Here," "523 Years of Resistance," and "Native Americans Discovered Columbus Lost at Sea" adorned Matthews Hall, which roughly marks the location of Harvard's Indian College, which existed from 1655 to the 1690s. The founding Harvard Charter of 1650, which established the Harvard Corporation as Harvard’s governing board, dedicates the College to "the education of the English and Indian youth of this country, in knowledge and godliness."
The event featured performances from members across a variety of cultural clubs, including Native Americans at Harvard College, Fuerza Latina, RAZA, Mariachi Veritas de Harvard, and Holoimua O Hawaii.
SaNoah LaRocque ’19, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, performed a jingle dress dance, and said being on the East Coast held special significance because the area represented the epicenter of contact between colonial settlers and native people.
"To say that we still have these little bits of our culture, to say that we still dance these dances, that we can still speak these languages, and have this culture—it just means the absolute world to be able to dance on this ground, in front of these people at Harvard College, of all places," LaRocque said.
Kenard G. Dillon ’18, who performed spoken word on his Navajo-Apache-Hopi heritage, said some performances may have been political, but the overarching goal of the event was to celebrate indigenous cultures.
"We're here to celebrate the resilience of each of our individual peoples who have lived through colonization, and assimilation, and genocide," Dillon said.
Near the performance area, attendees could sign a petition demanding that Harvard rename Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day.
“We believe Columbus does not represent Harvard’s values of  ‘respect, dignity, and different’ among others and each other,” the letter to University President Drew G. Faust read. It cited cities like Portland, Ore., Seattle, Wash., and Albuquerque, N.M., that have recast the holiday.
"What motivated me to do this was in fact the idea that we can look at the historical record and understand that what [Columbus] did was in fact a violation of human rights," said Nakaiye Flotte, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student who wrote the petition.

Thirty-two Harvard undergraduates spent their Columbus Day weekend sitting not with a mountain of homework, but with a network of entrepreneurial-minded university students from around the country at this year’s “Start @ a Startup” conference in New York City.
Hosted by Business Today, Sequoia, and Yik-Yak, Start @ a Startup is a conference in its fourth year that “connects the brightest college students with startups from across the country for a weekend of educational and recruiting events,” according to its website. Harvard’s delegate class was comprised of 32 students, mostly upperclassmen, with varying degrees of interaction with the startup world, according to attendee Tomas A. Reimers ’17.
Keynote speakers at the event included industry tycoons like Tyler Droll, founder of the social media application Yik Yak, and Dustin A. Moskovitz ’06-’07, a co-founder of Facebook. Topics covered at the conference ranged from anecdotes about the developmental stages of startups to discussions about how to create competitive companies in today’s industry.
Reimers, who attended the conference for his second year this weekend, said he enjoyed the diversity of the presentations. “Every founder’s story is super interesting–the founder of Yik Yak dropped out of med school to start it. I think just getting the ensemble of perspectives was valuable,” he said.
Of the Harvard students who attended the conference this weekend, many of them said they have never experienced working at a startup. Others, like Akshar Bonu ’17, are part of the founding teams of tech startups currently attempting to carve out a niche in the industry.
For Bonu, whose mobile platform “Masquerade” uses an anonymous concept similar to Yik Yak’s, the conference was an “ideal opportunity to speak to thought leaders and CEOs who are in a similar space,” dealing with many of the same growing pains that first-stage startups experience.
For other students, the highlight of the experience came not from the panel of companies at the event, but from the smaller breakout sessions. In groups of about 10 students, these sessions paired conference-goers with industry representatives and facilitated open discussion about the experiences of working at a startup.
‘Start @ a Startup’ also gave students from across the nation the opportunity to talk to one another about startup concepts. “The obvious selling point is that you get to meet other interesting people who are also interested in startups,” said conference attendee Nicholas L. Larus-Stone ’17. “There's the advantage of potentially meeting someone who could be your co-founder.”

David Black, author and scholar-in-residence at Kirkland House, entertained a small group of attendees with a reading of his latest novel “Fast Shuffle” Monday evening in Kirkland’s Senior Common Room. 
A Massachusetts native whose career has spanned journalism, fiction writing, screenwriting, and producing, Black has written for the television shows Law & Order and CSI: Miami and produced the screenplay for the feature film The Confession, for which he won a Writers’ Guild of America Award. His most recent fictional work chronicles the story of Harry Dickinson, a determined private investigator who becomes entangled in a sinister plot.
“It’s my version of Don Quixote about a man today who think he’s a 1940s detective,” Black said as he introduced the book. “He sees the mystery in everything.”
Black emphasized the connections between his own novel and the classic tale, adding that other main characters in the novel also mirror important figures from Don Quixote.
Sharing several excerpts from the book with the audience, Black first read a descriptive passage meant to illustrate “a story within a story,” which he said was a recurring theme in his works, before discussing the afterword of the novel. According to Black, the novel started out as a screenplay and went through three different versions before finally coming to fruition.
When asked how his time in Hollywood influenced his later work during the question-and-answer session, Black said, “I think my writing was always fairly visual partly because I was a kid actor. Working on the shows really helped me think about structure. I always used to believe that writing was more about voice than anything else … but it’s really all about structure.”
One attendee, Travis C. Morrow ’18, said he enjoyed the event, adding that Black’s experience as a versatile writer enriched the discussion.
“It was really great to hear from someone with such experience and also vast knowledge of all fields of media and writing,” Morrow said after the event was over.
This week, Black is leading screenwriting workshops in Kirkland from Tuesday to Thursday, a seminar series which he has taught in previous years as well.

The Undergraduate Council voted to amend its bylaws on Monday, formally establishing the Freshman Class Committee as one of the official committees of the Council.
While the Freshman Class Committee, which serves as the UC’s outlet for planning events and initiatives for freshmen, has long been referred to as a “committee,” it was not officially designated as one. Finance Committee chair Riya N. Patel ’17 and Rules Committee chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, who sponsored the amendment, said at the meeting that over the course of a pilot period, the Freshman Class Committee had demonstrated its status as a legitimate committee.
The bylaws amendment was met with some criticism, mainly from the freshmen on the Council. Representatives said the amendment, which included a provision that did away with the committee’s long-guaranteed minimum budget allotment of $10,000 a year, could mean lower funds for the committee in future years. Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 proposed an amendment to the bylaw change that would keep the $10,000 in place.
"If we set now a minimum of $10,000, then every year the FCC will know they have $10,000 to improve the lives of freshmen," Gonzalez said.
Biebelberg, a three-year veteran of the Council, responded to the criticism saying that it is “generally poor practice” to allocate funds through the Council’s bylaws. Biebelberg added that no other committee currently had guaranteed funds prescribed in the bylaws and said it should be avoided in the event that the UC’s yearly budget drastically changes.
Representatives also raised an issue with a provision in the amendment that requires all spending by the Freshman Class Committee to be approved by the Council at large, bringing it in line with the practices of the UC’s other committees. Crimson Yard representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19 said he wants the committee to spend money at its own discretion.
"We would be better suited to do what we need to do if we were given the autonomy to make our own decisions," Whittaker said.
Despite several representatives’ reservations and a proposed amendment, the legislation passed unchanged with 25 in favor and three opposed.
Also at Monday’s meeting, representatives voted unanimously to allocate $1,500 from its Student Initiatives Committee budget to retroactively fund last weekend’s “[Blank] Party,” a social event hosted by Harvard College women’s groups.
The Council also held secretarial elections at the beginning of the meeting, and voted to elect Adams House representative Anna T. Wechsler ’18 as its secretary, the first non-freshman to hold the position in several years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has heard a record number of sexual assault cases—between 25 and 30—since it opened a new centralized Title IX office to handle the issue last fall, according to University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides.
Since it opened with the implementation of Harvard’s new University-wide sexual harassment policy last fall, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution has heard cases from 11 of Harvard’s schools or divisions, Karvonides said in an interview on Friday. Those cases have involved faculty, staff, and students, and a third involved allegations of nonconsensual sexual penetration. 
The 25 to 30 figure at least doubles an already spiked caseload Karvonides said ODR had heard in its first semester alone last fall, which she said surpassed the total annual caseload across the University in previous years.
ODR investigates and determines guilt in all sexual harassment and assault cases filed against students and staff, and most against faculty, across Harvard before handing verdicts off to school disciplinary bodies, except at Harvard Law School. At the urgings of professors there, a separate body investigates cases involving only Law students.
Of the 25 to 30 cases ODR has heard since fall 2014, between 10 and 15 are still open, said Karvonides, who oversees the body; more than half of the open cases were filed in the last two months.
Of cases the investigatory body has resolved, Karvonides said the office has found an “even mix” of sexual harassment policy violations and non-violations. It has also reached informal resolutions in some cases. One ninth of the resolved cases were administratively closed, meaning that the complaint did not lead to a full formal investigation.
Complainant and respondent demographics were not uniform, Karvonides added. Just more than half of the cases that ODR heard last school year involved a female complainant and a male respondent; the rest involved a combination of varying gender identities.
Previously, administrators had not released such detailed information about ODR and its early caseload. Karvonides, though, offered more information about Harvard’s most recent sexual assault case statistics just weeks after Harvard released the results of its University-wide sexual conduct climate survey.
The survey, which administrators described as “deeply troubling,” revealed that 31 percent of senior female respondents at the College reported being victims of some kind of sexual misconduct during their time at Harvard. Among senior undergraduate males, a subgroup that includes Extension School students, 8.4 percent reported having experienced some kind of sexual misconduct in that time. Undergraduates who identified in the survey as LGBAQN—lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, questioning, or not listed—reported experiencing sexual assault at higher rates.
The survey also found that many students—including undergraduates—were unaware of and placed little trust in the University’s sexual assault policy, its procedures for handling cases, and existing reporting bodies.
More than 70 percent of Harvard students surveyed reported that they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct, and only 20 percent were very or extremely knowledgeable about where to make a report. Rates of reported sexual assaults were also low, with 69 percent of respondents who experienced penetration by force indicating that they did not file a formal report.
Responding to the survey, Karvonides said the prevalence data “was of most concern” and that her office will push to increase University-wide knowledge and trust surrounding the issue.
“It identifies an area where we have so much more work to do. Without question, that is my takeaway,” Karvonides said. “The issue is that we need to build more trust.”
To that end, Harvard released a 10-page “Frequently Asked Questions” document clarifying its sexual harassment policy and the procedures governing case investigations on Monday.
Among other points, the document further clarifies how the University policy protects certain types of speech, seemingly addressing the concerns of Harvard Law School professors who this year questioned the policy’s impact on academic freedom.
The clarifying document released Monday maintains that speech that is “germane to coursework is not prohibited” by Harvard’s harassment policy, and that “where academically relevant, a professor or student may discuss sexually provocative or offensive material in class,” although “speech that does not have a legitimate educational purpose could fall within the Policy.”
The document also addresses when an individual under the influence of alcohol or other drugs can consent to sexual activity (a person who is intoxicated, but not incapacitated, can consent under Harvard’s policy).
According to Karvonides, administrators released the FAQ document after the federal government found the Law School in violation of Title IX last year and suggested that Harvard clarify its Title IX policy and procedures. Karvonides said University officials were until recently awaiting federal feedback on the clarifying document, but decided to release it after seeing the results of the campus climate survey.
Administrators are also preparing a separate, more comprehensive document to detail the legal definitions and regulations surrounding Title IX and sexual assault and harassment more broadly that govern Harvard. They also created a brochure last semester to outline the key points of Harvard’s policy and plan to optimize it for mobile use, Karvonides said.
Beyond investigators at ODR, Harvard offers sexual assault response resources through its Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Harvard University Health Services, and the Harvard University Police Department.
The College has two Title IX coordinators and offers support through various offices and specialty tutors in the Houses and proctors in the Yard. Groups of students—including Contact, Room 13, Response, and the Student Health and Relationship Counselors, or SHARC—also conduct peer relationship counseling services.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 Harvard students plan to travel this week to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing in Houston, Texas, to hear lectures, attend panels, and network with experts on the subject of how gender can affect work in computer science.
Speakers will include Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the book “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,” and YouTube CEO Susan D. Wojcicki ’90, among other high-powered women in the technology sector. Students will hear about topics ranging from artificial intelligence to internet-enabled tools over the course of the conference, which will run from Wednesday through Friday.
Lisa G. Chille ’18, who will attend the conference with the Harvard group, said, “I want to be in a place surrounded by other women who are interested in technology, which is not something you encounter every day here at Harvard.”
Chille is traveling to the conference on a scholarship provided by the Grace Hopper Celebration organizers, which includes travel, accommodations, and meals. Others’ travel is covered by the student organization Women in Computer Science. Ramya Rangan ’16 said she is attending on a scholarship provided by WICS sponsor CapitalOne.
Rangan, said that she attended last year’s conference to conduct job interviews and visit the career fair. This year, she said, “I’m excited to spend time with other women in tech from campus.”
Peter L. Ku ’16 said he will be the first male Harvard student to attend the Grace Hopper conference.
“I’ve been fortunate enough to have a lot of doors open to me, and I feel pretty strongly that I want everyone to have these doors open to them,” he said.
“There are a lot of things that are really deeply ingrained in our society that make it difficult for women to go into CS,” he said. “I think it’s really important for people of all genders and all backgrounds to be a part of this conversation.”
Some students expressed apprehension about missing classes for the conference this week. “It’s difficult because the conference is during weekdays, so we are essentially taking a whole week off for it, and it also happens to be right during midterms,” said WICS co-president Hana C. Kim ’17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Out of a field of 86 golfers at the Yale Invitational this past weekend, only 21 carded scores of par or below on any of the three days of action. Two Harvard players were able to shoot their way into this group, and they happened to be the team’s two freshmen.
While the future of the squad was certainly in the spotlight, the Crimson women’s golf team took care of business in the present, as it secured a 6th-place finish at Yale’s annual tournament. The results for the freshmen, and team as a whole, were even more impressive considering the level of competition the group faced.
“Four of the teams we faced are in the top-40 nationally and aren’t usually participants in this tournament, but I think our girls accounted themselves very well,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It was a good challenge and gave us a chance to see where we are against stronger competition.”
The quality of the golfers from Furman, Clemson, and Vanderbilt certainly showed, as these Golfweek Top-40 teams finished 1st, 2nd, and 4th, respectively. Lauren Stephenson of Clemson and Emily White of Michigan, were the only two players to finish under par for the tournament and shared the individual honors at 2-under 211.
Harvard’s golfers were not far behind however, as freshmen Michelle Xie finished 10-over for the tournament with a 223. Her best performance came on Friday, when she made four birdies en route to a one-under 70. That score put her in a tie for fourth heading into the final two days, and she stayed near the top of the leaderboard to finish in a tie for 13th.
Fellow newcomer Anna Zhou was only two strokes back with a 12-over 225. She was the only Crimson golfer to hole in an eagle during the tournament, and accomplished the feat on just the fourth hole of day 1. After a tougher day 2, Zhou finished as strongly as she started, carding an even-par 70 on Sunday.
Other golfers on the team found the course more challenging however, with junior Anne Cheng and seniors Courtney Hooton and Christine Lin never shooting below a 3-under 74 on any of the three days.
“The conditions were pretty windy all weekend, and the greens were really fast,” Lin said. “The course required us to think more strategically about our shots, and pushed us more so than the past few tournaments we went to. But I think the team did a really good job of adjusting to the conditions and staying in it.”
In the end, Lin finished with a 17-over 230, placing 36th overall. Cheng, shooting a 15-over 228, and Hooton, at 16-over 229, were right above her on the leaderboard. They finished 32nd and 33rd, respectively.
While Harvard battled over the course of the weekend, the group was not able to see improvement on their scorecards like its rivals from Princeton did. After edging the Tigers by one stroke to capture the Princeton Invitational team title last weekend, the Crimson finished sixth to the Tigers’ fifth in New Haven.
Harvard came out strong, leading Princeton by six strokes after shooting a 16-over 300 to the Tigers’ 306 on Friday. While the Crimson followed up with scores of 302 on day 2 and 299 on day 3, however, Princeton continually made improvements to drop to 297 and then 291.
Going into the final day, the Crimson still held a one-stroke lead over Princeton as the two teams battled for the number five spot behind the four top-40 squads. The Tigers saw their own underclassmen finish strong on the final day, though, with sophomore Tenley Shield and freshmen Amber Wang both shooting even-par 71’s to pull Princeton well in front of Harvard.
“Princeton played really well this week,” Rhoads said. “We would have liked to finish ahead of them, so there’s a little disappointment with that, but with the group of girls we have and their work ethic, we’ll bounce back.”
Bouncing back is exactly what the team has a chance to do as it closes out its fall schedule with one more tournament in Delaware later this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of the Harvard men’s tennis team had a weekend off from its fall tune-up season, co-captain Nicky Hu and junior Brian Yeung were thrown into the fire, competing against the top collegiate tennis players in the country at the ITA Men’s All-American Championships.
The duo traveled to Tulsa, Okla., representing the only Ivy League squad that qualified for the tournament, a feat made more impressive by the fact that Hu and Yeung just began playing together this season.
Last season, Yeung played with then-co-captain Denis Nguyen ’15 as part of the Crimson’s number one doubles tandem for much of the year. This fall, Yeung teamed up with Hu, and the pair entered the season tied for No. 37 in the ITA preseason rankings.
In the first round of the event, Hu and Yeung were set to take on Diego Hidalgo and Gordon Watson of Florida. But after a re-draw of the doubles bracket, the two faced down an even more formidable opponent: Texas Tech’s Hugo Dojas and Felipe Soares, seeded second in the tournament.
But the Harvard duo rose to the occasion, upsetting the senior Red Raider pair, 6-4, 6-3. Hu and Yeung moved on to the second round, where they faced Tulane’s duo of junior Chi Shan Jao and senior Dominik Koepfer, ranked 39th in the nation.
In a tightly contested battle, Hu and Yeung won the first set, 7-5, but narrowly lost the second, 7-6(5). Then in the decisive third-set tiebreak, Jao and Koepfer slipped by, 1-0(8).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a weekend off, the Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to New Haven for the three-day Bulldog Invite in the team’s first trip to Yale since last fall’s Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Regional Championships. Ivy League foes Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Yale, as well as Boston College, Pittsburgh, and Rutgers made up the weekend’s field. The Crimson finished its weekend with a 15-9 overall record.
Harvard faced off against Rutgers on Friday, a combination of Columbia and Yale on Saturday, and Pittsburgh on Sunday, with the matching being the first chances for the Crimson’s freshmen to compete against other schools. The weekend tournament was the first in which junior June Lee has competed in as a singles player following injuries from the spring that she has been rehabbing this fall.
Unlike traditional fall tournaments in which each player plays in singles and doubles tournaments regardless of their collegiate affiliation, the Bulldog Invitational was team-based, with each of the squads squaring off in seven singles and three doubles matchups each day.
“We were excited to break away from campus and travel down to Yale,” coach Traci Green said. “It was a fun team event where we were able to tally our individual sports to create a team score, and we did pretty well. It was good to see our squad produce as a team.”
On the tournament’s final day, Harvard fell in both singles and doubles action to the Panthers. The freshman duo of Sabrina Xiong and Erica Oosterhout picked up the team’s lone doubles victory.
Crimson singles players went 3-3 against Pitt. Oosterhout and sophomore Nikki Kallenberg picked up the two Harvard wins. The victory on Sunday capped an undefeated weekend in singles action for Kallenberg. Captain Amy He fell in a three-set match to Pitt sophomore Callie Frey.
On Saturday, the Crimson bested a team made up of Lions and Bulldogs players, 5-1 in singles action and 2-1 in doubles play.
Kallenberg led the charge in the singles department. The sophomore bested Yale’s Tina Jiang to pick up her second singles win of the weekend. After losing the first set, Harvard sophomore Annika Ringblom stormed back to claim victory over Bulldogs captain Ree Ree Li. Lee claimed a hard-fought three set victory to finish the weekend 2-0 in singles.
“June’s starting to come alive and show some signs of her old self,” Green said. “It’s still pretty early so she’s just taking it one day at a time right now. It was very fun to have her out there competing for the team. She’s really fun to watch because she leaves it out there on the line.”
Freshman Danielle Mirda and He also picked up singles victories for Harvard. In doubles action, Ringblom and Oosterhout picked up an 8-6 victory while Mirda and He clinched the doubles point in an 8-7 win over Columbia’s Sarah Hu and Lindsey Mendelson.
“It’s really good to see where [future opponents] are and where we are,” Lee said. “It’s good to know that we can beat Columbia and Yale, and it’s good to get a sense of how their players play. We’ll keep that in mind when we do play them during the season.”
On Friday, in which some of the day’s matches were cut short due to rain, the Crimson took on a Scarlet Knights team that finished tied for last in the Big Ten last spring. Despite losing two of the three doubles matches, Harvard dominated in singles play, picking up victories in six of the seven contests. Ringblom and Kallenberg each picked up singles victories from the top two spots.
Oosterhout won in straight sets over Rutgers’ Ksenija Tihomirova while Lee ousted Mariam Zein. Mirda and He coasted to straight set wins from the sixth and seventh singles positions. The underclassman duo of Kallenberg and Sabrina Xiong was the only Harvard doubles team to win on Friday. The pair posted an 8-3 victory over Gina Li and Zein.
“As a team, everyone performed pretty well,” Lee said. “Everyone fought really hard. I think one thing we can do better is improve our starts, especially in doubles. Everyone seems fit and no one was struggling in their third set.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scored two first-half goals against a Cornell team that had only conceded one this season previously, as the Crimson women’s soccer team picked up its third straight Ivy League victory on Saturday in Ithaca, N.Y., by a 2-0 score.
Senior forward Emily Mosbacher tallied her first goal of the season, while junior forward Midge Purce picked up her Ivy League-leading fourth score in conference play as Harvard (6-6-1, 3-0-0 Ivy) removed the Big Red (8-1-3, 1-1-1) from the ranks of the Ivy League unbeatens.
“We obviously knew they had a great defensive record and that we’d have to come up with strategies to unlock their defense,” junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “Our forwards and our front six really played well together.”
Mosbacher continued the Crimson’s recent trend of scoring early in conference games. The Woodside, Calif., native headed a pass from junior defender Bailey Gary past Cornell goalkeeper Kelsey Tierney to give Harvard the lead in the 21st minute. It was the first goal of the season for Mosbacher and the 10th of her collegiate career.
“Ivy League soccer is just a totally different game,” Mosbacher said. “We knew we had to bring something special since it’s so intense. I think it made the whole team really happy to get after it.”
Gary has registered one goal and three assists in the team’s last two conference games.
The Big Red’s Tierney had posted a shutout in all but one of her previous 11 starts, with the lone blemish coming against Wagner on Sept. 27.
Purce continued her hot streak on Saturday. The junior took nine shots, including five on goal, to outshoot the Big Red on her own. Her goal in the 26th minute gave the Crimson more than enough insurance, and the team is 5-0-0 in games in which it has scored at least two goals.
“If we’re scoring goals, we’re going to have a good chance of winning games,” Durack said. “Midge and everyone is contributing to that. Midge is a world-class player and she brings something extra to the field every time she’s on it. It’s not just her; everyone around her is doing their part, beyond their part really.”
The Crimson’s suffocating defense was on display once again in Ithaca. Harvard held the hosts to four shots, with only two on net. Durack has had to save only seven shots since Ivy League play began two weekends ago. Defenders Gary, Becker, and senior Alika Keene, along with co-captain Haley Washburn and senior midfielder Brooke Dickens, anchored the effort as each player logged 90 minutes of game time.
“If I don’t have to face shots, my life is a lot easier,” Durack said. “Everyone’s defending all over the field. We have a strong defensive mentality. When you put a lot of pressure on the other team, it makes it very hard for them to attack. It just took some time for everyone to feel comfortable playing with each other.”
The Crimson has had Cornell’s number in recent years. Harvard is 18-0-4 in the last 22 meetings between the conference rivals. The last loss the Crimson suffered against the Big Red came on Oct. 2, 1993, in overtime. This weekend’s game was Cornell’s first home loss of the season while Harvard has won its last three on the road.
Since Ivy League play began, Harvard is second in the conference in goals. Fresh off of her game-winning goal on Tuesday evening, junior forward Rachel Garcia added two shots for the Crimson. Gary has led an offensive surge by the Harvard defense, as six of the Crimson’s last ten goals have been either scored or assisted by a defender.
“Our defense has always been rock solid,” Mosbacher said. “They’ve just kept doing what they’ve always been doing, and we’re capitalizing on it now.”
After going up early in the game, Harvard did not let up. The Crimson had six shots and two corner kicks in the second half while allowing only two Big Red shots. The win also allowed the Crimson to keep pace with Princeton atop the Ivy League standings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down 2-1 since the midpoint of the second half, the Harvard women’s field hockey team kept generating corner chances against Brown.
Then the team couldn’t execute one corner. Then another. Then another.
But just when it appeared as if the Bears (5-6, 1-2 Ivy) would escape Jordan Field with the victory Saturday afternoon, a Crimson co-captain broke the scoring drought. On the fourth corner Harvard (7-3, 2-1) won in as many minutes, Elizabeth Jacobson took the ball on the edge of the shooting circle, faked left, and fired a shot into the bottom-right corner.
The 60th-minute goal proved to be the impetus that the Harvard offense needed to break through what was previously a stout Brown defense. The Crimson rode the momentum to two more goals in the next five minutes.
Another five minutes after that, the horn sounded and the Crimson had earned its first home victory in Ivy League play over the visiting Bears.
The 4-2 win was even sweeter for the players after last week’s overtime defeat to the Quakers.
“The loss at Penn—we took that really hard,” Jacobson said. “And we knew we couldn’t lose any more. These Ivy games are too important. That gave us a little more energy at the end today than we [had] last game.”
The contest had gone back and forth until the final minutes. Before Harvard put away an insurance goal with 3:26 remaining, no team had led by more than one at any point in the game. There was equal pressure applied by both teams, as the Bears narrowly outshot the Crimson offense, 14-13.
Despite the evenly matched contest overall, the second half featured much different action compared to the first. At the game’s outset, both Harvard and Brown were sluggish on the attack.
Combined, the two sides mustered just one shot on goal in the first 15 minutes, with fouls slowing down the pace of the action.
The Bears slowly came to life, however, attacking with more energy in the Crimson 25-yard area and winning several corners. Their newfound aggression soon paid off, with their leading scorer, senior midfielder Alexis Miller, turning home the first goal of the game off a corner.
Harvard, meanwhile, did not manage a shot during the opening 35 minutes.
“During the first half, we couldn’t find our rhythm,” Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “But second half, we were able to get the job done a lot easier. We were able to get more attacking motions going that luckily resulted in goals.”
The offensive onslaught could not have come at a more critical point of the season. Harvard had managed only three goals in its first two Ancient Eight matchups, riding a strong defense to a split of those two close, overtime affairs, topping Yale and falling to Penn.
In just 30 minutes against Brown, however, the offense emerged and bested that three-goal tally. In fact, the four goals scored by the Crimson in the second half matched the most goals the teamhas scored in any half this season.
Junior forward and leading scorer Marissa Balleza put Harvard on the board three minutes after halftime. The team piled players into Brown’s 25-yard area, sending several shots on frame before Balleza poked the ball into goal on a rebound.
“We came out of halftime with a different mindset.” Jacobson said. “First five minutes, we needed a goal. Then we’d focus on the next five minutes.”
Though the Crimson’s initial push proved successful, the Bears hit back within 10 minutes to retake the lead, 2-1. Harvard continued to push the ball into Brown territory in the second half, however, and tied the game once again on Jacobson’s goal.
Jacobson added another solo finish three minutes later, after receiving the ball off a corner and faking out two defenders. Sophomore midfielder Ellie Cookson then added a final goal against a tiring Brown defense with four minutes left to seal the 4-2 victory.
The final whistle marked the Crimson’s first non-overtime win of the season against an Ivy opponent as it enters the meat of its conference schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Crimson’s 40-3 drubbing on Cornell’s home turf, the Harvard offense was humming right along. But that wasn’t the only aspect of the Crimson’s game that got the group to 4-0 on the season.
HARD DAY FOR HAGY
Before Saturday’s contest against Harvard football, Cornell running back Luke Hagy had run roughshod over his last six opponents. In each of those half-dozen games, he had topped 100 yards and ripped off at least one play of 20-plus yards.
But all good things must come to an end. In Hagy’s case, both streaks crashed to a violent halt against the Crimson defense, which held the 204-pound senior to 33 yards on 15 carries. His longest run of the day was a seven-yard dash in the third quarter.
That starved stat-line validated Harvard’s focus on stopping the ground attack. Again and again during the week of practice, Crimson players had repeated the mantra that in order to beat the Big Red, they would have to stop Hagy.
“Defensively we’ve just continued to play great football,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Our first defense hasn’t been scored upon in the last three games.”
Shutdown domination began with the first drive, when the defense held Hagy to three yards on four carries. That opening act set the tone, as Hagy finished the first quarter with 14 yards on eight carries and the first half with 23 yards on 12 carries.
For the second weekend in a row, senior linebacker Jacob Lindsey headlined his unit, racking up a game-high seven tackles, two of which were for a loss. He also recorded three of the first four tackles of Hagy.
“Going against what I think is one of the most exceptional O-lines in the country, week in and week out in practice, makes our Saturdays easier,” senior defensive end Dan Moody said.
NO FISCH AT THE C
Crimson fans, used to seeing wide receivers Seitu Smith and Andrew Fischer jog out together and high five before the opening kickoff, may have been distressed to watch Smith trot out without his senior companion on Saturday. But the distress did not last long.
On a weekend when Fischer stayed at home to recuperate an upper-body injury, freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley proved to be a capable replacement. He started alongside Smith, returned kicks and punts, and snagged a 46-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter.
“I roomed with Seitu,” Shelton-Mosley said. “He’s just given me a whole bunch of information, [telling] me to be natural up there, just like high school. I came out today and just wanted to have fun.”
Midway through the first quarter, Shelton-Mosley had his first bit of fun when he fielded a kickoff at the five-yard-line and raced to the Big Red’s 47. On the next play, senior quarterback Scott Hosch found senior tight end Ben Braunecker for Harvard’s first score.
The going was more difficult in the punt-return game, as the freshman faced off against Cornell’s Chris Fraser, the premier punter in the Ivy League by nearly six yards a kick.
Time and again, Fraser rendered run-backs impossible, sending kicks over Shelton-Mosley’s head or out of bounds near the end zone. But when Shelton-Mosley did field the ball, he made something of the opportunity, earning 39 yards on three attempts.
The impressive outing climaxed with 6:30 left in the third quarter, when Shelton-Mosley ran a slant route down the left sideline and pulled in a 46-yard pass in the end zone.
“He’s just a natural player,” senior defensive back Jordan Becerra said. “You just could tell—really natural with the ball in his hands, runs great routes. He’s very hard to guard in practice.”
Even though Fischer is expected to return this week, Shelton-Mosley will likely continue to play meaningful snaps for the Crimson, as he has all season.
MUCH HOSCH RUSH
Scott Hosch is not a natural rusher. In 2014, when he saw action in 10 games, Hosch finished with 102 yards on the ground—good for an average of 2.3 yards per rush.
But at Schoellkopf Field on Saturday, he certainly looked the part. Seven times he tucked the ball and ran, ending with 78 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown.
The peak of his performance came with four minutes left in the third quarter, when Harvard lined up for a first-and-10 on its own 47. After dropping back, Hosch noticed open field on the right and motored forward for 35 yards, a career long.
On the next play, he took a designed run for another 10.
Many of Hosch’s scrambles during the game came as the pocket was collapsing, and the quarterback’s mobility was one of the key reasons why the Crimson left the field without conceding a sack for the fourth straight game.
In 2015, Hosch has already tallied 124 rushing yards, eclipsing his previous 12-game total over the span of his career.
“[I was] stepping up, still keeping my eyes down the field,” Hosch said. “But [I was] seeing a lot of open grass and just taking off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After withstanding a barrage of opportunities by Cornell and being held to no shots in the first 18 minutes, the Harvard men’s soccer team finally earned an inviting opportunity in the form of a set piece. Having won a free kick 30 yards out, a cross into the penalty area seemed eminent. Sam Brown, however, took a different approach.
The sophomore midfielder struck the ball deep into the box, where it bounced right in front of Big Red goalkeeper Rhys Moller and into the top right corner of the net. Brown’s goal, paired with a second from classmate Christian Sady, propelled the Crimson (4-4-2, 2-0-0 Ivy) to a 2-0 win at Cornell (1-9-1, 0-2-0)—Harvard’s third straight victory and second in conference play.
“It was not the prettiest game of soccer that we’ve played, but we were committed to work for each other,” junior co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “We grinded the game out, so I was very pleased to see that and proud of my teammates.”
Prior to Brown’s effort, Cornell had pressured the Crimson defense early on, but the backline stayed strong. Harvard limited the Big Red to just one shot on target and five total, not allowing the opponents to get off clean shots.
Even after the goal, however, the momentum continued to favor Cornell, as the Crimson defense worked to withstand the Big Red attack. A sloppy clearance inside the box in the 30th minute gave Cornell junior defenseman Liam Crotty a clean shot at goal, but his effort was parried away easily by co-captain netminder Evan Mendez.
After taking an 11-1 shot advantage into the half, the Big Red came close to scoring again right out of the gates. A pristine stretch of tiki-taka-style passing led to junior midfielder J.J. Black running up the wing and into the box, where he centered the ball past Mendez to junior forward Chris St. Germain. But the ball never found its target.
Harvard senior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh slid in between St. Germain and the incoming ball, getting to it just before his opponent and allowing his teammates to boot it clear.
“That was a great tackle,” co-captain Mark Ashby said. “Everyone on the sidelines was excited about it because he’s a midfielder, so he tracked all the way back into our own box and did a great job there.”
Missed opportunities were the story of the night for Cornell. Though they managed to outshoot the Crimson 18-5, only four shots were on goal.
Harvard, meanwhile, showed no difficulty in making the most of its opportunities. Sheeleigh and classmate Oliver White got the Crimson attack going in the second stanza, as the teammates forced substitute keeper Mitchell Meyer to parry away two shots in the span of a minute.
Just one minute later, the Crimson celebrated as Sady found the back of the net. Senior Jake Freeman took advantage of a sloppy first touch by a Cornell defender outside the penalty area, playing a quick one-two with White that sprung Freeman into the box.
Freeman coolly sent a low cross toward the far post and the feet of a sliding Sady, who tapped it into an empty net. It was the first goal of the season for the sophomore.
“It’s nice to see [Brown and Sady] score because it lessens the load a little bit,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “It’s more likely for them to score again because they have that extra bit of confidence.”
The game proved to be a physical one for Harvard. Due to a bumpy pitch, both teams struggled to string together consecutive passes and had to settle for a physical battle for possession.
The conditions made it difficult for the Crimson to produce fluid transitions from its backline to its forwards, forcing Harvard to play a less technical, more physical game than the team is used to playing.
“It turned out to be too dangerous to complete passes in our defensive third and build up from the back like we usually would try to do,” Ashby said. “During this whole game, I don’t think we connected passes from our defenders to our midfielders to our forwards.”
With the win, Harvard remains tied atop the Ivy League with Dartmouth and two points ahead of Brown, whom the Crimson hosts on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­No team wants to have to rely on its bench players to win a game, let alone a crucial matchup against a conference-leading archrival. But that’s exactly the position that the Harvard women’s volleyball team found itself in on Saturday afternoon against Yale, held without the services of junior Grace Weghorst and freshman Christina Cornelius.
But based on the team’s performance, there was no easy way to tell that the squad was injury-depleted.
Buoyed by the play of freshman Jocelyn Meyer and sophomore Ellery Jones, Harvard (8-7, 4-1 Ivy) took down the Bulldogs (8-6, 3-2) in straight sets after edging Brown (8-8, 2-3) in five on Friday to propel itself from a precarious place in the conference standings to first place in the Ivy League.
“This was a really good weekend in terms of our tenacity and our depth,” senior Kathleen Wallace said. “I think we really proved that we could overcome a lot of very tough situations.”
HARVARD 3, YALE 0
Having never recorded four kills in a match before the start of the weekend, Meyer found herself with nine kills at the 13-13 point of the third set. After another of the freshman’s kills put the team up three, Meyer’s last kill was the most emphatic, sending a bad dig from the Yale side straight into the ground to give the team a 20-14 advantage, eliciting cheers from her teammates and the crowded Malkin Athletic Center.
“[The win] was a whole team effort,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “That’s awesome that [Meyer] can step up like that.”
That kill was the final blow for the Bulldogs, as the visitors were unable to fight back and save the set. Junior Corie Bain finished the game with a kill straight through the middle of the defense, an exclamation point on Harvard’s sweep. Jones was also crucial for the Crimson, helping fill in the void left by Cornelius, who was tending to a sprained ankle. Jones had never recorded a kill in her career, but registered four on the night.
“Everyone on the team would agree that [Meyer and Jones] are two of the hardest working players in lift and practice,” Wallace said. “We have full confidence in them. We’re so glad that they played lights out. They’ve been training so hard for this moment.”
After taking home Ivy League Player of the Week honors last weekend, senior Kelly Johnson only recorded four kills for Yale in what appeared to be limited action. Freshman Kelley Wirth, however, was a bright spot for the Bulldogs on the day, notching a team-high 12 kills.
Harvard did not trail in the match at any point, taking 5-0 leads in both the first and third sets.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
Entering this weekend, the Crimson had fared poorly in fifth sets, only eking out one win in five tries.
But in a crucial conference matchup, the Crimson took its fate into its own hands, starting off the set with a Corie Bain kill followed by three straight points off of Bain serves. Two kills from co-captain Caroline Holte and one more from senior Kathleen Wallace shot the team out to an insurmountable 10-3 lead.
“It took us digging in and being gritty,” Wallace said. “Brown is a really scrappy team. We had to be patient and I think we did a much better job than we have in the past.... of playing our own game.”
Harvard found itself in tie breaking points with Brown in the second and third sets, but was unable to edge out the Bears, falling into a 2-1 deficit. Brown took a 3-0 lead in the fourth set, but Harvard was able to tie the game at four behind kills from Kebe and Meyer. The Bears would not hold a lead for the rest of the game.
Christina Cornelius left the game in the fourth set with a sprained ankle, just one kill and block away from nabbing a double-double. But Bain, Wallace, and sophomore Paige Kebe were able to pick up the slack, notching 16, 14, and 11 kills, respectively.
Last week’s Ivy League Rookie of the Week, Sabrina Stillwell, and junior Payton Smith led the Bears with 13 kills each.
