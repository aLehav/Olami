At Harvard Class Day 2023, Comedian Larry Wilmore Calls on Graduating Seniors to Pursue Their Passions
Outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow told graduates that he, like the Class of 2023, is “wondering what the future holds,” as he said goodbye to Harvard during Commencement morning exercises on Thursday.
After serving for five years as president, Bacow will leave his post in Massachusetts Hall and retire at the end of June. Claudine Gay, who served as Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean for the entirety of Bacow’s presidency, will succeed him as the University’s 30th president.
Bacow’s remarks ended a two-and-a-half-hour Commencement ceremony filled with tradition, live music, and festivities as the Class of 2023 celebrated the end of their Harvard education.
Bacow conferred 1,850 bachelor’s degrees to College graduates in his last Commencement as University president. Overall, he awarded 9,110 degrees to students across the University — which included College seniors, students from Harvard’s graduate schools, and graduates from the Harvard Extension School.
Alongside Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Bacow also bestowed honorary degrees — including one on acclaimed actor Tom Hanks, who delivered the ceremony’s keynote address.
Five others also received honorary doctorate degrees: Admiral Michael G. Mullen with a doctorate of laws, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Jennifer A. Doudna with a doctorate of science, radio executive Hugo N. Morales ’72 with a doctorate of humane letters, historian David Levering Lewis with a doctorate of laws, and biochemist Katalin Karikó with a doctorate of science.
The speeches by Hanks and Bacow to conclude Harvard’s 2023 Commencement were preceded by two undergraduate student addresses and one graduate student speech.
Bacow reflected on his own graduation in Tercentenary Theatre, noting that receiving a Harvard education raised his expectations for himself and also allowed him to reimagine what he thought was possible to accomplish in life.
“At my Commencement, I never imagined that someday I would be standing here giving the final remarks at your Commencement,” he said. “I hope — as you find your way through life — that you will have similarly pleasant surprises.”
Bacow also extended thanks “to all of those who helped me along the path of life, to those who gave me opportunities I never could have imagined, to those who gave me the extraordinary responsibility to lead Harvard over these past five years, and to those who helped me do it.”
He expressed gratitude to Adele F. Bacow, his wife of 48 years, and the students in the crowd at Tercentenary Theatre.
“I am grateful to each and every one of you for being a constant source of hope and optimism,” Bacow told the Class of 2023. “Serving as your president has been the privilege of my life. I look forward eagerly to celebrating all that you will do for the world — and all whose lives will be made better by your good work.”
Bacow concluded his speech by saying goodbye to Harvard, before returning to his perch in the infamous Holyoke chair as the audience rose to their feet in a standing ovation.
“To the Class of 2023: thank you, farewell, and godspeed,” Bacow said.

At Harvard Class Day 2023, Comedian Larry Wilmore Calls on Graduating Seniors to Pursue Their Passions
Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks urged Harvard’s Class of 2023 to “embrace liberty and freedom” during the University’s 372nd Commencement exercises on Thursday.
Hanks — an acclaimed American actor known for his performances in “Forrest Gump,” “Saving Private Ryan,” and nearly 100 other films — has garnered two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe award, seven Emmy awards, and the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.
Prior to his remarks, outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow awarded Hanks — this year’s featured keynote speaker — an honorary Harvard degree, along with five other recipients.
But before Hanks could take center stage, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 interrupted with another surprise for the actor: a three-minute musical tribute to Hanks put on by three students from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, who recapped every movie he had ever acted in.
“Tom Hanks is like a box of chocolates,” the performers sang — referencing “Forrest Gump,” the movie that helped Hanks win his second Oscar. “You never know what you’re gonna get.”
Handing off the podium, Bacow joked by way of introduction, “Dr. Hanks, top that.”
Dressed in a crimson Harvard graduation robe, Hanks handed his cap to University Marshall Katherine O’Dair before taking his spot at the podium.
“It’s not fair, but please don’t be embittered by this fact,” Hanks began. “That without having done a lick of work, without having spent any time in class, without once walking into that library — in order to have anything to do with the graduating class of Harvard, its faculty, or its distinguished alumni — I make a damn good living playing someone who did.”
“It’s the way of the world, kids,” he said.
During his speech, Hanks also poked fun at the student speeches that preceded his Commencement address.
“I don’t know much about Latin. I have no real passion for enzymes, and public global policy is something I scan on the newspaper just before I do the Wordle,” Hanks said, as audience members chuckled.
“And yet here I am closing — closing for Josiah, Pallas, and Vic,” he added, referring to the three student speakers.
Hanks called on graduates to not remain indifferent in the face of those seeking to undermine the truth by spreading “alternative facts.”
“Propaganda and bald-faced lies will erode over time,” Hanks said. “Idolatry and imagery lose luster and effect.”
“Ignorance and intolerance can be replaced by experience in the wink of an eye, but indifference will narrow the vision of America’s people and make dim the light of Lady Liberty’s symbolic torch,” he added.
Hanks told the Class of 2023 that they, like every graduating class and every adult, are faced with the choice of being one of three types of Americans: “those who embrace liberty and freedom for all, those who won’t, or those who are indifferent.”
The difference between them, Hanks continued, lies “in how truly you believe, in how vociferously you promote, in how tightly you hold to the truth that is self-evident — that of course we are all created equally yet differently and of course we are all in this together.”
“We are all but human,” Hanks said.

Ahead of Harvard Commencement, Graduating Students Celebrate Accomplishments with Affinity Ceremonies
Following morning Commencement proceedings in Tercentenary Theatre, graduating seniors returned to their residential houses Thursday to receive their diplomas at small ceremonies featuring food, photographs, and abundant house pride.
Earlier in the day, seniors and graduates across the University heard a keynote address from actor Tom Hanks and remarks from outgoing Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow.
The house ceremonies — which returned last year following a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic — also highlight awards and academic honors earned by house residents.
At the Adams House ceremony, convened beneath a tent on the Malkin Athletic Center lawn due to ongoing renovations, Adams Resident Dean Salmaan A. Keshavjee acknowledged the complex emotions that come with graduation.
“We know that a moment like this is bittersweet because Adams is a really special place inside another special place, Harvard College,” Keshavjee said to graduates.
“The commencement, as the word suggests, is a new beginning. The launching pad for one’s dreams, aspirations, and the chance to engage with the world in a meaningful way” he added.
Leverett House senior Ayah Al-Zubi ’23 said she felt “disbelief” as she sat in the audience during the ceremony.
“I cannot express how much pride and celebration I have, for my ancestors, my people before me, who dreamed of this place, and we’re here now and we’re doing it on their behalf,” Al-Zubi said. “This is for my family, and I hope they’re proud of me, and that’s honestly all I could ever ask for.”
At his ceremony, Quincy House senior Benjamin T. Rossen ’23 also said he found it “very rewarding” to be surrounded by his family throughout Commencement.
“My parents love to come up to campus, but just have everyone here — it’s very heartwarming,” Rossen said. “We’re very proud.”
Like other aspects of Harvard house life, the ceremonies are colored by specific traditions. Years past have featured mural painting, kayaking trips, and ceramic tile-making.
Benjamin R. Meron ’23 said he enjoyed the opportunity to celebrate the day with a more familiar crowd at the Adams House event.
“It’s really special to have the ceremony together with the Adams House community, where you really get to know a large portion of the faces that you see on the stage,” Meron said.

Thousands of graduates, Harvard faculty, friends, and family crowded into Harvard Yard on Thursday for the University's 372nd Commencement Exercises.
Before 8 a.m., students from Harvard's 12 graduate schools and the College processed through the Yard and into Tercentenary Theatre. Above, graduates walk by the John Harvard statue in front of University Hall.
Students from the Harvard School of Dental Medicine walk to their seats in full regalia and with props: a large “Harvard” toothbrush and a printed cutout of a graduate’s face. Family members watch from the side and on the steps of Widener Library at the rear of the Theatre.
Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks speaks to students in the crowd before the start of the ceremony. Hanks delivered this year’s keynote speech and received an honorary degree along with five other recipients.
The commencement ceremony is deeply steeped in tradition, from actors processing in colonial garb before the ceremony on the left to the Sheriff of Middlesex County on the right, who calls to order and adjourns the ceremony by pounding his staff.
Josiah E. Meadows ’23 delivered the Latin Salutatory — an address entirely in Latin — at the start of the ceremony. His address was titled “De Fructibus Institutionis Harvardianæ” or “The Value Of A Harvard Education.”
Hanks hugs Harvard Kennedy School graduate Vic Hogg, who delivered the Graduate English Address.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and President-elect Claudine Gay confers degrees to candidates from the College.
Students from each program stood up to cheer when their school was announced. A total of 9,110 graduates were granted degrees this year.
Honorary Harvard degrees were bestowed to six recipients. From left to right: Admiral Michael G. Mullen received a doctorate of laws, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Jennifer A. Doudna was given a doctorate of science, and radio executive Hugo N. Morales ’72 accepted a doctorate of humane letters. Historian David Levering Lewis, biochemist Katalin Karikó, and Hanks also received honorary doctorates.
In receiving his honorary degree, Hanks was gifted a volleyball as a reference to his 2000 film “Cast Away.”
Bacow’s remarks concluded the two-and-a-half-hour ceremony. The outgoing University president reflected on his own graduation in Tercentenary Theatre and thanked the Class of 2023 for “being a constant source of hope and optimism.”
The Commencement Choir sang a variety of anthems throughout the ceremony. The choir is composed of students from the Harvard Gleee Club, Radcliffe Choral Society, Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium, and members of the Harvard University Choir.
The ceremony concluded shortly after noon and graduates left the gates of the Yard to join their family members and return to their houses for diploma-awarding ceremonies.
