After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, Oct. 12 was Indigenous Peoples’ Day in Cambridge. In Boston, it was Columbus Day. According to the Harvard Registrar, though, the University was closed four Mondays ago because of “Columbus Day (Federal), Indigenous Peoples’ Day (Cambridge).” This 21st century doublet may seem like a trivial concern at first — clumsy wordiness appears to be its worst offense. Yet just a bit more thought reveals the absurdity inherent in taking both sides of a fight between two irreconcilable claims.
If we take into account the full weight of historical scholarship, to honor Christopher Columbus is to approve of, or at least to tolerate, the genocidal massacres he committed or condoned against Indigenous peoples. To celebrate Indigenous peoples, meanwhile is to condemn Columbus for those same actions. The two conceptions of this holiday are fundamentally opposed to one another; they simply cannot both be cited at the same time in any rational sense.
This is only one example of the egregious inconsistency that arises from Harvard’s studious apoliticism. Another example, one with starker and more significant implications, is the long-standing firefight between student activists and the Harvard Corporation over divestment. University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other Harvard administrators have never claimed that divestment is wrong on moral grounds. However, they have preemptively precluded the use of Harvard’s endowment — the immensity of which makes it by far the most powerful weapon at its disposal — to advance political causes. The official response has always reiterated that the endowment ought not to be used to “achieve political ends.”
But even the notoriously feeble moral platitudes distributed by Bacow this summer call for more of a stand than this. To pick just one example, Bacow believes “that America should be a beacon of light to the rest of the world.” Such a belief, if sincerely held, ought to urge its holder — especially one who urges us to “act on your beliefs” — to find ways to brighten that beacon.
Perhaps Bacow believes that leading the world in the fight against the climate crisis or against the commodification of punishment, for example, are not causes worthy of his institution’s moral attention. Or perhaps he believes that divestment would not achieve either of those goals. Either one of these positions could save his inaction from incoherence. But to not contradict Bacow’s asserted principles, Harvard must either declare its opposition to these ends or assert that the proposed means are faulty. Declaring that some of its abilities are out of bounds will not suffice; to shield its most potent power from consideration entirely, even behind as high-minded a shield as apoliticism, is rank hypocrisy.
And for what? Some claim that the University must preserve its nonpartisan image, but it’s not as if the image of Harvard as an immaculate ivory tower dedicated to the impartial search for everlasting truth is that which most Americans see.
As politics has spread itself across almost every aspect of our lives, Harvard, albeit unwillingly, has become thoroughly enmeshed with our national power-struggles. This summer, Bacow sued the federal government over proposed visa restrictions in order to protect international students. Harvard’s affirmative-action policies have become yet another flashpoint in our endless culture wars, and one of its professors another bogeyman in the attempt to blame China for the coronavirus.
For better or for worse, right-wing America has lumped universities, Harvard included, into the so-called “liberal establishment,” and 59 percent of it believes that these institutions have a negative effect on the United States. Among Harvard graduates in the House of Representatives, Democrats outnumber Republicans 32-6, and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Senator Tom B. Cotton ’99 (R-Ark.) — a former Crimson Editorial editor — and other prominent conservative alumni continue to downplay their Ivy League origins in favor of an adopted outsiderhood. 72.4 percent of this year’s freshmen class is liberal, and only 7.4 percent is conservative. The right-wing media’s breathless coverage of last year’s Harvard-Yale divestment protest and the well-publicized whining of self-professed free-speech crusaders strongly suggest that conservatives will continue to think of Harvard as a bastion of progressivism, no matter how adamant the administration is in shying away from standing up.
An apolitical vision of the University, therefore, is a pipe dream. Any hope that Harvard will morph into a universally appealing source of disinterested knowledge for Americas both red and blue is misguided at best and misleading at worst. Nor should Harvard strive to appeal to all: At a time when the most basic tenets of the academic enterprise — the scientific method, international collaboration, and many others — are under attack by a segment of the electorate, any real attempt to appeal to that segment would constitute a wholesale betrayal of the intellectual principles to which Harvard is dedicated. Rather than begging for acceptance from those who hold it in contempt, Harvard should abandon such sycophantry and free itself to abide by its own moral claims.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know you shouldn’t but you do it anyway. Impulsively, you type that text message. You hit that tiny powerful arrow. Sent. Delivered. Time for the dread to set in.
We all know the feeling. One day you’ve reached your tipping point and you send an unwarranted and possibly irrational message. Or maybe you finally worked up the courage to shoot your shot only to get shot down. Or there’s a chance your excessive enthusiasm was matched with the ever disheartening “k” or a complete ghosting. No matter the situation, we have all experienced the sharp descent into self loathing when we can’t retract our awkward or miscalculated words.
We’re filled with regret at the thought of those indelible text bubbles. They make us vulnerable. And it’s not just texts that haunt us; it's all of our many online mistakes. It’s as if they’re written in stone, except the stone is very light and it can never be destroyed.
It’s ironic to think that what takes up so much room in our minds occupies zero space in reality. Practically speaking, our messages, posts, and other online mishaps are mere pixels. Our communications are simply electromagnetic waves traveling between routers. Even though our real and online lives overlap significantly, the internet is a space largely created in our minds. It’s intangible, unidimensional, and lighter than air.
It feels contradictory that something so theoretical can make us feel so viscerally. That something which appears impermanent can be so enduring. Something so seemingly light can weigh us down so heavily.
This negotiation between action and consequence, lightness and weight is the subject of Milan Kundera’s “The Unbearable Lightness of Being.” His biggest question: is life – or in our case, life online – heavy or light? The argument for heaviness embraces Nietzche’s notion of eternal return, the belief that events of our existence will recur infinitely. Weight is burden but also meaning. Lightness, meanwhile, is freedom, transience, and insignificance.
Most actions online feel exceedingly light. We have the ability to post, edit, delete Facebook or Instagram posts at any time. We have the freedom to search anything on Google and the capacity to contact nearly anyone through iMessage. On Snapchat, our selfies last just seconds before they disappear into the ether. We feel emboldened to send those risky texts, and in more harmful instances, some even feel powerful enough to harass others. Moreover, everything feels replaceable because what can’t you buy on Amazon? Human replacements are possible, too, thanks to Tinder. Just broke up with a significant other? Someone else is only a right swipe away.
Psychologically, however, our online existence weighs on us most heavily because our words can never be destroyed and their repercussions never get erased from our minds. The internet has the power to alter one’s life course completely. In 2017, ten students’ Harvard acceptances were rescinded for exchanging sexually explicit and racially derogatory memes in a private Facebook group. In 2019, incoming Harvard freshman Kyle Kashuv’s admission was also rescinded when it was exposed that he had written multiple racial slurs in a Google document. Kashuv called his actions retrospectively “idiotic.” But it is hard to excuse both him and the students of 2017 on account of simple immaturity. These individuals did not realize that the words they had carelessly shared held immense historical or personal weight for others. Even this year, David D. Kane, a Harvard Government preceptor, has faced allegations of blogging racist remarks using a pseudonym. His alleged words have likely cost him the trust and respect of many, particularly his own students.
When it’s just us and a screen, we can act lightly because we feel free. The illusion that life can be light online is possible since we can’t see the heaviness of others firsthand. In the absence of human connection, we lose touch with the reality that we have a responsibility toward others. But notably, we forget about our own heaviness, too – that online, we’ll face consequences more lasting than those offline. We struggle to grasp the gravity of our actions because it is so easy to act that we forget meaning is attached to action. Unfortunately, Nietszche is right; we will make these mistakes over and over because we are human. And online ones will be memorialized. The weight of eternal return drowns us, especially when we’re left to cope with the permanence of what we’ve done.
To create an account for most anything online, we’re faced with a cryptic, long-winded disclaimer in microscopic font entitled “terms of agreement.” It’s something we should definitely read but probably don’t. The rules are right before us, but they’re obscure and inevitably, users don’t fully understand what they’re signing up for. As a generation born into the internet life, we’re familiar with the phenomenon. Our online lives come with the inherent terms of agreement that actions do have meaning and consequence.
Yet, we try to or are urged to forget the consequences of our online conduct. Life is sometimes difficult and not always fun, so we seek the lightness that we’re led to believe exists online. Social media creators and internet developers profit off this desire by building a mirage for us: a virtual world that is easy, accessible, appealing, and above all, weightless. It is an escape from obligation when we don’t want to talk face to face or don’t want to engage with real life. But as we live our lives online, we should remember that just because we’re not signing a physical paper contract, doesn’t mean that we’re exempt from the terms of agreement. Our signatures are our words, images, videos, our choices. We create weight in a light space because we’re human and we’re born with weight. What we touch becomes necessarily heavy. Often, it feels, unbearably so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today in Boston, schools are empty and bars are open. As students in the Boston Public School system shift back to fully remote learning due to a citywide COVID-19 uptick, local restaurants and bars remain open to the public — many with indoor dining. Not a month before the move to remote-only learning, Boston relaxed restaurant dining restrictions to expand customer party capacity and open up bar seating. How is it that high need children have lost the limited access they had to their physical classrooms, while any adult is able to waltz into a Boston restaurant?
All Boston public school students began this school year in remote-only instruction. “Highest need students” — a classification which includes students experiencing homelessness, those with disabilities, and English language learners — were allowed to return to in-person classes two days per week beginning Oct. 1. The ability of these highest need students to attend a brick and mortar school twice a week is what has been lost in Boston’s all-out school closure.
The closing of Boston Public Schools hurts these children. When school shifts to home, inequalities are exacerbated. The third of Boston Public School students who are learning English may lack the English language support at home necessary to successfully transition to online learning. Economically disadvantaged students, who make up roughly three quarters of BPS students, may not have sufficient access to the internet and necessary technology. And what does remote learning look like for the 4,500 Boston Public School students who are homeless? Or for the one in five students who participate in BPS disability programs? We worry about how the critical in-person support schools briefly provided these students will be transfigured to fit the online environment, if recapitulating it virtually is even possible.
For many K-12 students, under normal circumstances school provides support and stability they may be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Because of COVID, there will be a generation of children who will have to do without. It will take intense efforts to catch these kids up and to keep them on the grid. Boston Public Schools Superintendent Brenda Cassellius has acknowledged the great difficulty the shift to online-only learning poses to students losing school access, and says the district is exploring options to remotely support these high needs students. However, publicly announced plans have yet to surface three weeks after the move to online-only schooling. The digital divide widens in the meantime.
Harvard and its students could help combat this — students from the Harvard Graduate Schools of Education and Harvard schools at large could pitch in to support Boston Public Schools, from providing tutoring resources to generating innovative ideas to mitigate the impact of remote learning on vulnerable students.
Experts are predicting that the pandemic will only get worse as temperatures plunge. We fear that it may be long before Boston Public Schools reaches its benchmark for resuming in-person learning for highest need students, which requires the “citywide seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate is at 5% or below for two consecutive weeks.” The cost of closing schools is high. Public health guidelines should not be flouted, but we find ourselves wondering: How long can this cost accrue before something irreparable breaks?
This benchmark also poses the question of whether we should prioritize consistency for students over experimental attempts at in-person learning. It’s possible that Boston’s citywide positivity rate fluctuates above and below the 5 percent benchmark. Is a snippet of in-person learning worth a disruptive, mid-semester change in learning mode?
Perhaps we could learn a lesson from cities over 100 years ago that employed impressively creative techniques to keep schools safe and open during the Spanish Influenza: They created open-air classrooms (even in the winter), taught on top of the school roofs, and, in one case, held class in an abandoned ferry.
What we are sure of is that if students can’t sit at desks, it doesn’t make much sense that adults can sit down at restaurants. Boston Public School’s will to protect the health of its students and workers is admirable and apparent. But the cost of online-only education are real — however much we feel that as college students, our younger and less-privileged peers must feel it all the more so. What sacrifices the city makes on their behalf needs to be readdressed: A bottle of beer and round of appetizers at the neighborhood dive is a good place to start.

In February, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that men are about twice as likely to die as women from COVID-19. Since then, researchers have been clamoring to understand the perceived sex disparity in COVID-19 cases and mortality rates. In order to explore this relationship further, some clinicians have experimented with using estrogen patches and progesterone injections to boost the immune responses of infected men.
Without commenting on the efficacy of these experiments, Harvard’s GenderSci Lab posits that the emphasis on biological sex differences as the cause for this disparity may be misguided.
Beginning in March, the lab launched their COVID-19 Project, which aims to counter the misconception that gender/sex disparities in COVID-19 case and mortality rates are solely caused by biological factors.
A self-identified “feminist laboratory,” the GenderSci Lab challenges biological essentialism — the notion that biological factors alone determine gendered difference. To avoid the perpetuation of this misunderstanding, the lab uses the term “gender/sex” in their research as opposed to using either term on its own; they aim to steer conversation away from the traditional tendency to separate the biology of sex and the sociality of gender and instead toward a more holistic integration of those interconnected variables.
Through their work, the lab hopes to illuminate how gendered experience within society interacts with biology — and it believes that it is critical to consider these variables in intersection, as opposed to isolation, with regards to COVID-19.
“Sex is not a free floating variable,” says History of Science and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality professor Sarah S. Richardson, the founder of the GenderSci Lab. “It’s situated within the direct biological milieu, the organ, the tissue, but also the species and the environmental and social context. We know that that variable has different meaning across those contacts and that those sorts of comparisons so often overlook, and obscure, really the important differences.”
Richardson founded The GenderSci Lab in 2018 with the goal of bringing together “gender scholars and biomedical scientists to build and validate new theory and methods for the intersectional study of gender/sex in human populations,” the lab’s website says. More specifically, its work centers on innovations in the methodology of operationalizing gender, countering bias, and engaging with the implications of data on policy.
In tracking COVID-19 data, the lab has found ample evidence to suggest that, at the very least, further investigation is needed to fully understand how the interaction of social variables leads to varying case and mortality rates across social groups. Probing the generalization that men are dying at higher rates than women, the lab has discovered significant variance in the gender/sex disparity of case and mortality rates both between different U.S. states and between racial groups.
The lab, for example, found that women and men in North Carolina were dying at approximately the same rate. However, when they looked specifically at the African-American population, they found that women were testing positive for COVID-19 at a rate of 58 percent, compared to 42 percent in men.
This finding highlights one of the main issues with sex essentialism. “The harm is that it may be that the vulnerability relates to a small group of people with a particular trait, but in a particular population, it’s differentially distributed across the sexes,” Richardson explains. Neglecting intersectionality within genders risks overlooking highly vulnerable groups.
Historically, “the hype in sex difference research” has been given too much weight, Richardson claims, and headlines about the current pandemic similarly overemphasize biological essentialism.
“As we were reading these articles and talking amongst ourselves, there was almost this energy — we couldn’t help but think and talk about what this meant given our background and research,” explains another of the lab’s founding members, Marion C. Boulicault, a graduate student at MIT whose work focuses on feminist philosophy in science. “We were worried that the emphasis on the biological was causing researchers and public policy experts to miss important cues from the social world,” she continues. “Social conditions are much more apt to being intervened on than biological conditions.”
Starting the project was not an easy undertaking; data collection on COVID-19 cases in the U.S. was (and largely still is) sparse, sporadic, and negligent in addressing the intersection of different social variables. As a reaction to the lack of useful data, the GenderSci Lab launched an offshoot of the COVID-19 Project — the U.S. Data Report Card, which assigns grades to different states based on how well they report COVID-19 data. The grades are based on the reporting of age, gender/sex, comorbidity status, and race/ethnicity.
As of June 26, only 11 states were reporting comorbidities among fatalities, even though data suggests that 93 percent of COVID-19 deaths are associated with pre-existing conditions. The lab hopes the report card will function as a tool for accountability, encouraging states to be more thorough in their reporting of data.
Lab member Ann Caroline Danielsen, a graduate student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, comments, “without a really fine-grained level of data, it’s hard to then craft a public health response that is sensitive to the needs of people that need it the most and to also understand what the sources of those vulnerabilities are.”
The need for “fine-grain” data is illuminated when gender/sex mortality rates are compared across different states and between different racial demographics. In Massachusetts, women are actually more likely to die from COVID-19 than men, contradicting the idea that men are inherently more vulnerable. Of course, there are also other states like New York and New Jersey where men suffer significantly higher mortality rates than women. What this variance in data suggests is the likely influence of more local and social factors, the lab claims — biology alone would leave little room for these differences between states.
Another finding that has spurred the lab to advocate for more investigation into the interaction of social variables is the difference in case and mortality rates between racial groups. Not only are Black and Latinx Americans being infected at much higher rates than white Americans, but the gender gap within these groups also varies.
For example, data from Georgia and Michigan — the only two states currently reporting COVID-19 mortality data disaggregated by both gender/sex and race/ethnicity — shows that the gender gap within the Black population is much more significant than that of the white population, in addition to the Black population as a whole contracting the virus at higher rates. Further, although Black men are dying at significantly higher rates than Black women, the mortality rate of Black women is still much higher than that of white men.
The generalization that men are dying at higher rates than women, [x explains], may exclude Black women from potential policy solutions, an alarming possibility that the lab hopes to prevent through their data collection and awareness-building efforts.
Richardson has a theory about where and why generalizations based on gender/sex arise: “It’s a pattern that we see frequently,” she says. There is “a major effort by some of the largest funders of bio science research to emphasize sex as a biological variable,” she explains. “If you’re a biomedical researcher, you want a molecule, you want a biological target, you don’t want someone to tell you it relates to social structures. You can’t give a medicine for that.”
But this tendency toward biological essentialism is dangerous, Richardson claims, explaining that it “contributes in a pernicious way to broad-based gender ideologies that suggest that men and women are different, and that this is why we have the inequalities that we have in society.”
Though the lab has been able to generate some hypotheses about COVID-19’s interaction with gender/sex, the researchers want to emphasize that their main objective has been to build awareness for the potential inaccuracies posed by biological essentialism, as well as the need for comprehensive data across multiple intersections of social and biological factors. They have published a guide for responsible media communication about COVID-19 and a teaching module that can be used to spur discussion about the gender/sex disparity misconception.
The goal is progress, not perfection. “There’s never going to be a single perfect way to collect data. You have to make the kind of choices that I think are unavoidably based on values,” Boulicault says. “[The kinds of values that] we, as the lab, think are important to consider about in data collection, analysis, and visualization are about making sure that the data is presented in a way that makes the concerns of communities who are both marginalized — and therefore more vulnerable — more visible,” she says. “We make choices about data that reflect the kind of open society that we want to be.”

Martha Schwartz thinks narrower streets could save the world.
“The idea that there’s just not enough room to plant trees is just something we all made up,” said Schwartz, a professor of landscape architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Schwartz, along with her colleague Edith Katz, recently submitted a proposal to the Harvard Climate Change Solutions Fund to shrink roads and grow more trees. “[The] thesis is that it can bring down the temperature of a city. We have this great opportunity in our streets. There’s a lot of surface area covered that could be recovered in material that allows the Earth to breathe.”
Schwartz believes that Americans don’t value their land enough: They pay attention to what can be built upon that land, rather than how we can best maintain it. Even if trees are not the most profitable or cutting-edge option, “we don’t really have a choice now,” she explains. “We’re not smart enough to be able to reproduce the benefits of natural systems. We have to be very clever in integrating and regenerating these systems through technology.”
While an undergraduate studying fine arts and biology at the University of Michigan, Schwartz was drawn to the “big, beautiful outdoor” scale of landscape architecture .She got her first taste of landscape architecture through Warren Wagner, a botanist and one of Schwartz’s best teachers in college. Working with Wagner, she started thinking about how plants evolve and adapt, as well as how humans can engineer plants.
Four years ago, Schwartz closed her architecture private practice to think about larger issues. “[I] decided that I had to pay attention to climate change,” she explains. “I pretty much put my practice aside and just self-taught. I’ve read lots and lots and lots of books about climate change, and I ended up putting forth a seminar about geoengineering, which I think made everybody think I was absolutely crazy.”
“As I was reading [about climate change science] I found out that the people who are really very active in this are right around the corner from me at the GSD,” she said. “I had a nice friendship with them. I would just go and ask them questions.”
Schwartz began to see how plants, animals, organic matter, and carbon cycles all worked together to keep humans safe.
She realized that we had been conquering nature. It was now time to regenerate it. She incorporated ideas for such regeneration into her designs, which became the beginning of her proposal to the Climate Change Solutions Fund.
“We put so much carbon up into the atmosphere. Now that we have to take down, it turns out that soil and plants are the natural decarbonizing [elements] that we have on the Earth.”
“I actually found a new value for the profession itself,” she continues. Although it felt at times like a niche field with tedious work day to day, Schwartz was spurred on by the realization that a well-designed landscape could define “this kind of next cycle of humanity and humankind.”
One of the ideas within the proposals was to address the urban heat island effect — in which inner cities are ten degrees Fahrenheit hotter than their outlying counterparts, especially when people live in concrete or brick buildings that absorb heat during the day and release it in the night. In places where air conditioning is scarce, Schwartz says, this effect is even more extreme.
Trees might bring relief: They naturally create shade and provide cool habitats while dehumidifying the air.
The proposal took shape in 2017 Schwartz’s studio in the depths of the Graduate School of Design, which she shares with Edith Katz.
Schwartz and Katz set out to integrate a lot more trees into our cities. They worked with Harvard Forest and studied four of the most densely populated townships in the area: Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville.,
By 2060, they reasoned, cars will be smaller — much smaller. This means city streets could be narrower, reimagined to make room for more trees.
Katz and Schwartz’s team determined we could shave 20 to 25 percent off of all the streets and plant linear forests with the new space. Linear forests are different from normal trees that dot roads because of their robust root systems and long lifespans.
“You dig out a long linear trench and stuff as many trees in there as possible,” Schwartz explains. “You can plant 300 trees in six parking spaces.”
Of course, a research proposal only exists in the ether: How will these 300 trees actually be planted? To answer this question the team turned to Shubhendu Sharma, founder of Afforestt, an organization that plants trees native to particular regions to plan for the practical methods.
Once planted, how would the trees be watered? Natural aquifers take thousands of years to regenerate and drilling for water is a temporary solution. Realizing that it takes a village to create a landscape, the team turned to another collaborator :Rob Adams, a city planner in Melbourne helped them understand how to water these trees once planted.
His method involves adding devices in tree trenches to capture water that would normally run off the sidewalk and into a sewer. This means older cities like Boston will actually be less prone to disease since their sewer systems are no longer attached to stormwater drains.
Schwartz knows progress will be gradual — at times, painfully so. She anticipates years of advocacy and outreach to convince people to narrow their streets. In the end, however, she hopes to afforest as much of the city as possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital developed a new vaccine allocation tool that will help local and state leaders across the nation strategize the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, according to a press release last week.
The technology enables states to prioritize vulnerable populations using localized data as they plan vaccine distribution. It follows allocation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine.
Ariadne Labs, a health systems innovation center run by HSPH and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the health nonprofit Surgo Foundation launched the vaccine allocation planner in late October.
Vaccine allocation guidelines released by NASEM outline four major phases of vaccine distribution that prioritize high-risk populations. Phase 1A includes frontline workers in medical facilities and first responders, while Phase 1B includes those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Rebecca L. Weintraub, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who co-developed the technology, said the new tool will help states account for vaccine scarcity when preparing for distribution.
“The demand is quite complex to predict because there’s so many concerns regarding vaccine confidence,” she said. “Even so, we’ll still face scarcity, and so we’re hoping this tool helps you manage the scarcity, understand how to plan for equitable distribution, and pace expectations.”
By inputting demographic data into the planner, local leaders can identify groups with the highest need for a vaccine. Weintraub said the interactive tool allows viewers to easily comprehend and draw conclusions from the statistics.
“You can view it as a graph, or you can hit a table and download the data or a map that’s helpful for you to visualize vaccine coverage,” she said.
The tool will also estimate the size of high-risk populations to help states develop strategies for vaccine allocation and execute their plans. Weintraub said she hopes this technology will help local leaders both efficiently and equitably distribute vaccines.
“I think there’s an incredible role in the midst of an infodemic — the volume of information that we’ve generated in this pandemic — to create tools that help plan and predict and scenario plan for not only effective but equitable distribution,” she said.
Weintraub also noted that the planner will continuously improve as new data and insights become available. Specifically, the tool will track the progression of vaccines through their four phases of clinical trials.
“We’ll continue to update the planner to represent the pace of the science, the pace of this phase three trial and phase four data that come out,” she said.
When COVID-19 vaccines are made available to the public, there will most likely be multiple versions that constitute a portfolio, Weintraub said. She added that as the virus continues to evolve, a varied portfolio of vaccines will be essential in addressing the diverse needs of populations across the world.
“There’s a lot to watch ahead regarding — and to really emphasize — the importance of diversification of the vaccine,” she said. “We are serving a global population with many different reasons why people are vulnerable to COVID-19.”
Correction: November 7, 2020
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the School of Public Health tool will suggest a fair distribution for a vaccine. In fact, the tool will suggest an equitable distribution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Department of Justice confirmed Monday afternoon that it is continuing to investigate Harvard’s admissions programs for discrimination, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by The Harvard Crimson on Oct. 25.
The response comes nearly one year after Civil Rights Division Chief Kilian B. Kagle last confirmed the investigation's ongoing status, and less than one month after the Justice Department sued Yale University for discriminating in its admissions process.
In his response, Kagle withheld requested documents relating to the investigation on the grounds that the records were part of an “ongoing law enforcement proceeding” which their disclosure might “interfere with.”
Stetson University law professor Peter F. Lake ’81 said he believes the Justice Department’s investigation into Harvard admissions is being made in tandem with Student for Fair Admissions’s ongoing lawsuit against the University, which SFFA has appealed in the First Circuit Court.
“I felt all along that the Harvard case is the ‘test case,’ but it's actually several legal issues happening simultaneously. You've got the administrative and court activity happening at the same time,” Lake said. “I think both the Department of Justice and plaintiffs are building a case against Harvard admissions.”
William R. Yeomans, a Columbia Law School lecturer who worked in the DOJ's Civil Rights Division for 26 years, said he also thinks the Justice Department’s investigation is part of a conjunctive effort with SFFA. He called SFFA’s ongoing appeal the “principal vehicle” to challenge Harvard’s race-conscious admissions process.
“This one, obviously, is being driven by outside demands to some extent,” Yeomans said. “It would just seem very unlikely that they would go ahead and take independent action while this other lawsuit is pending in the Court of Appeals.”
Yeomans added that it would still be possible for the Justice Department to file a lawsuit during a lame-duck period if President Donald J. Trump loses his re-election bid. The nation is currently waiting for several key swing states to finish counting ballots in a tight presidential race between Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
“There may be some inclination to try to lock in a lawsuit for before Trump leaves office and sort of tie the hands of the Biden administration. I hope that's not the case. I think that would be totally inappropriate,” Yeomans said. “It's difficult for the Department of Justice to change the litigating position once a case is in trial.”
Launched more than three years ago, the Justice Department’s investigation does not have a set timeline. Lake said the indefinite nature of the investigation is typical.
“It doesn't really surprise me that this is going on for a while. Not everything wraps up quickly with administrative investigation like this. I've seen [Department of Education] investigations that went on for years,” Lake said. “It's not out of the ordinary.”
Lake also said he believes the prolonged nature of the investigation may mean the Civil Rights Division is building a strong case against Harvard.
“My sense is the Department of Justice thinks there is something there that they're looking for, and the fact that it hasn't ramped up quickly would tend to signal that they're still digging,” Lake said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Smoke Shop, a Boston-area barbecue restaurant, opened its doors in Harvard Square this Halloween.
The restaurant, situated on Holyoke St., is the Smoke Shop’s newest addition to its chain of locations in Kendall Square, Seaport, and Assembly Row. Its menu, designed by owner and pitmaster Andy Husbands, features an array of BBQ dishes, such as Texas-style brisket and “Nashville Hot” chicken sliders.
Husbands said his Halloween opening was a “traditionally slow night” but that the calm first days have been welcome.
“Generally when people open any type of business, they want to be out the gate, you know, crushing it, but for us, this is actually kind of nice,” he said. “Think of it like an orchestra, or a football team, you have say 30 employees or 30 members — players — getting everybody to play the same symphony at the same time is difficult.”
“So this is a nice way of kind of just slowly ramping up, which is great,” he added.
The opening of the Harvard Square location comes as other Square restaurants — and restaurants around the country — adapt their operations to meet health and safety guidelines.
“We know they are coming at a really challenging time,” Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said. “But if anybody could do it, they can do it.”
“They are courageous and they have great product and they have a great brand name,” she added.
Husbands said ensuring the health and safety of his team and his customers has been his priority. He said his experience adapting operations at his other locations has given him and his team “good practice” at implementing procedures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“Me and some of the team members built these beautiful plexiglass partitions,” he said. “The way we designed them — they almost kind of almost disappear in your sight in the restaurant, so it's almost like a security blanket.”
“It's a balancing act between, you know — kind of, everything's normal and everything's okay, yet we are keeping you safe. That's a new part of hospitality that we've been really striving to show,” Husbands added.
Husbands, who has decades of experience in the restaurant industry and in barbecue competitions, said he brings his passion for barbecue to the new restaurant.
“Barbecue to me is more than just the meat,” he said. “Barbecue is the friendliest food — it's the food of gatherings, graduations, family celebrations, and I think it's just a really, really special thing, and that's what we try to kind of do at the restaurant.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and universities across Europe have established a link between air pollution and mortality risk from COVID-19, according to an Oct. 26 study published by the Oxford University Press.
The study utilized satellite imagery and an atmospheric model to calculate pollution levels around the world, then comparing it with epidemiological data on coronavirus deaths from the United States and China through the third week of June 2020.
The researchers focused on PM2.5, or particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. They concluded that 15 percent of global COVID-19 deaths could be linked to this type of manmade pollution.
A previous study co-authored by Francesca Dominici, a researcher at the School of Public Health, found that in the United States, for every microgram of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, the mortality rate of COVID-19 increased by eight percent.
This new study, also co-authored by Dominici, examined these effects on the global level and arrived at similar findings.
“They [PM2.5 molecules] are caused by many types of fossil fuel combustion. Mostly cars and power plants, but there are many other sources, and these particles penetrate very deep into your lungs,” Dominici said.
“They compromise your immune system, they have been associated with an increased risk of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and also they can get in your bloodstream and lead to inflammation and cardiovascular disease.”
According to Dominici, the long-term damage that particulate matter does to the lungs greatly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19.
“You've been breathing out pollution for a very long time, and then you are contracting the virus,” said Dominici. “Your ability to respond to the virus might be compromised, because evolution has compromised your lungs’ immune system.”
She noted that conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — comorbidities for COVID-19 — are also caused in large part by long-term exposure to PM2.5. These conditions contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the primary causes of death due to the coronavirus, where fluid collects in the lungs depriving the body of oxygen.
The global loss in life expectancy caused by exposure to PM2.5 is comparable to a lifetime of smoking tobacco, according to the study.
Andrea Pozzer, the study’s first author and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, said the atmospheric model used in the study calculated the percentage of pollution observed in satellite imagery that was man-made, rather than connected to “natural pollutants” such as dust and sand.
“We know exactly which fraction of PM2.5 is man-made,” Pozzer said. “So we could estimate what is the mortality or the additional mortality to COVID that could have been avoided if, let's say, human ecological footprint would have been equal to zero.”
He added that studies in 2003 found similar increases in mortality risk for the SARS epidemic, and the body of research that connects air pollution to respiratory illness and death is constantly growing.
“Our take home message is that, actually, no, it's not possible to do anything to protect yourself from poor outdoor air quality as a single person,” Pozzer said. “You can do [that] as a community, of course, as a country, and in general, as a human population. That is clear.”
The paper concludes that the long-term effects of air pollution will outlast the coronavirus.
“The pandemic ends with the vaccination of the population or with herd immunity through extensive infection of the population,” the paper reads. “However, there are no vaccines against poor air quality and climate change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston healthcare workers discussed their experiences combating COVID-19 in diverse populations at a webinar Thursday hosted by the Harvard College Medical Humanities forum.
The panelists — Massachusetts General Hospital doctor Ailis M. Tweed-Kent, Boston Medical Center doctor Katherine A. Gergen Barnett, and Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center healthcare worker Regine Watson — spoke about particular challenges people from marginalized groups face and the importance of individual storytelling.
COVID-19 transmission rates are high in Chelsea, Mass. because the population primarily comprises first-generation immigrants, many of whom have essential jobs as supermarket or construction workers, Tweed-Kent explained.
“They are on the front lines exposed without having the same voices that physicians have in terms of getting access to PPE,” she said.
Social distancing among family members can also be difficult because many families share “one bathroom and very few bedrooms,” according to Tweed-Kent, who added that immigrants in particular may be afraid to take advantage of public services.
“The undocumented patients were afraid to to access the state initiatives like the Chelsea food bank,” she said. “They were very afraid to take advantage of these services that they were eligible for.”
Watson added that immigrants may be afraid to discuss how they contracted COVID-19 for fear of getting in trouble.
“When I speak to people who are from where I’m originally from, it makes them feel a little bit better,” Watson said.
Watson, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, added that she herself did not have a “good experience” with the virus, but she was grateful for her family. Watson also discussed the challenges she has seen others, and especially Black people, face when dealing with COVID-19.
Gergen Barnett said she thinks COVID-19 serves as a “magnifying glass” for the disparities in healthcare and said that, as a physician and educator, she finds hearing individual stories important.
“There is a lot of emotional healing that can happen by telling your story,” Gergen Barnett said. “It can bring people together and even the listener of the story feels a sense of deep engagement.”
Gergen Barnett discussed a project to collect stories about how COVID-19 affected rent, jobs, and childcare, specifically among Black and Latino people.
“We want to collate these stories and change policy,” Gergen Barnett said.
Event attendee Sahana Bail ’20, a Boston Public Schools Fellow, wrote in an email that the event showed her new ways to serve her clients better.
“Dr. Barnett’s words opened my eyes to the power of getting to know my clients on a deep level and sharing that understanding with legislators to make systemic change,” Bail said. “I couldn’t agree more that state leaders need to feel the power of my clients’ stories from both before and during this pandemic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalist and political analyst Mina Al-Oraibi discussed the United States’ declining reputation in the Arab world at a Harvard Kennedy School event Thursday afternoon.
Al-Oraibi, who is editor-in-chief of Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National, joined Kennedy School professor Tarek E. Masoud and Egyptian diplomat Karim Haggag in conversation for the fifth event in a series titled “USA 2020: The View from the Arab World.”
The dialogue was aimed at reversing the phenomenon of Americans commenting on the Middle East, which often paints the latter in a negative light, Masoud said in an interview following the event.
“It’s not only to get an Arab view on what’s happening in the United States, especially around the elections, but it’s to have an Arab perspective about U.S. foreign policy towards the region,” said Haggag, a professor of the practice at the American University in Cairo and visiting fellow at the Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative.
Al-Oraibi opened the event with a discussion of how current American political uncertainty may undermine its reputation in the Middle East. She pointed to the U.S.’s still-undecided 2020 presidential election and instability caused by domestic unrest, a disjointed response to the coronavirus pandemic, and increasingly polarized politics.
Still, Al-Oraibi said the declining role of American politics in the Middle East stretches beyond the current presidency. American military disengagement in recent years has been accompanied by political disengagement, she said.
“It didn’t start with Donald Trump,” Al-Oraibi said. “The Obama administration was very, very clear that they wanted out, they wanted to pull back.”
Al-Oraibi said if she were a single-issue voter focused on foreign policy toward Iraq, she would be “very concerned about the possibility of a Biden presidency,” as presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden Jr. advocated for the division of Iraq into sects in the mid-2000s as a U.S. Senator.
Turning to Iran and Syria, Al-Oraibi said a flaw in the Obama administration’s approach, in part crafted by Biden while he served as Vice President, was its willingness to negotiate with governments she called “enemies.”
“It was clear that the Obama administration came in wanting to make deals with our enemies,” Al-Oraibi said. “In some ways, they’re quite similar to the Trump administration.”
Al-Oraibi said the Obama administration could occasionally be duplicitous in its power-brokering in the Middle East, and, as a result, the Trump administration’s clear-cut positions may be appealing to some, particularly Syrians.
“With Donald Trump, it was almost like, what you see is what you get,” she said. “You had the Obama administration saying one thing publicly and promising the [Syrian] opposition one thing, and behind the scenes, having a different agenda and really prioritizing the [Iran] nuclear deal.”
When asked whether Biden or Trump is more likely to use diplomacy to deal with political crises, however, she answered, “Biden, for sure.”
The speakers also discussed how the two previous administrations have collectively deteriorated the average Arab citizen’s view of the U.S. Al-Oraibi said young Arabs still remain divided, with some still holding admiration for “the idea of American culture” and the “American dream,” while others have become “quite resentful of American foreign policy.”
“They’re quite cynical about it and think, better if the United States is in decline,” she said of the latter group. “Let it go, like, ‘it’s better for us.’”
“America’s loss is Canada’s gain, because that respect and kind of aspiration now goes towards countries like Canada, New Zealand recently with its leadership, more than the United States,” Al-Oraibi added.

You’re probably running into the TikTok trends and Among Us memes all over your timeline these days. We felt similarly and decided to review this multiplayer game, available as a phone app.
Pre-game thoughts:
Sakshi: I had heard about Among Us constantly for a couple weeks before I actually played my first game. Curious about all the hype, I got my (more experienced) friends to organize a game. I remember wondering, what exactly are these creatures? Are they astronauts? Aliens? Whatever they are, after seeing everyone ignore their p-sets due at midnight just to run around a spaceship, I knew I had to check it out for myself.
Akila: I remember being unwittingly roped into my first game of Among Us, confused why everyone was talking about imposters: was this a Harvard simulation, but people actually wanted to have imposter syndrome? Why were people so eager to do chores? I wish my roommates wanted to empty the garbage this much in the middle of midterm season.
Games 1-2:
Sakshi: I started off my first game getting killed within the first minute, learning that you should never be alone in a room with a stranger (an applicable life lesson!). As a ghost, I discovered that not only could no one communicate with you, you could also just float around in space beyond the ship — very existential. I did, however, find joy in haunting my murderer, and even though I didn’t get much practical experience as a ghost, it definitely fueled my desire to seek vengeance on the other players in the next game.
Akila: My favorite part of the game was still picking cute outfits: if we can’t have a real Halloween I will settle for a knife hat or strangely career-specific accessories: goggles and sailor caps are the closest student researchers and the sailing team are going to get to having a real semester. I’m still frightened by the graphic kills — why were the innocent beings suddenly stabbing others with unusually long tongues and literally tearing your flesh apart? What happened to everyone sketching the same five words on skribbl.io at the beginning of quarantine?
Games 3 - 6:
Sakshi: I finally became an imposter! It was eerily similar to how my first couple months in college have gone: faking tasks while my peers complete them all for me and venting out of breakout rooms as soon as they open. But I quickly discovered it did not live up to all the hype—when the other players inevitably found out I was creepily following them around the spaceship and just standing there awkwardly, I opened the chat to find several messages saying the same two words: “red sus.” While this was disappointing, I was pleasantly surprised by everyone’s enthusiasm to exercise their democratic right to vote (no Harvard Votes Challenge needed)!
Akila: At this point, I seriously contemplated dropping some serious bucks to have an Among Us child. I started to enjoy the imposter power trip: I could do things that would never fly in real life: I locked myself into rooms with one other person and sabotaged every part of the ship just to see who was a *real* team player I can pick for my next group project. Of course, I dreaded being a crewmate myself, running around desperately finishing a checklist until my inevitable demise reminds me of school a little too much.
Games 7+:
Sakshi: By this point, I was fully committed to the universe of strange aliens either dutifully doing chores or violently stabbing one another (there’s no in between!). I convinced myself that even if my essays weren’t writing themselves while I played Among Us, at least I would be on track to be the next AOC! And we don’t even get 15 second cooldowns between Zoom calls, so I’m not sure why the imposter has to rest between kills? Between making my crewmates recite tasks to test their authenticity and randomly calling emergency meetings to frame other people with no evidence, you could throw me into a game with no vision and I’d still come out on top.
Akila: I’m officially indoctrinating new players to the game and perusing strategy guides. My professors should be proud of me for solving the most complex application of the Traveling Salesman problem: how can I find the shortest path to complete all my tasks? I still get lost between Sherman-Fairchild and Northwest, but I know each of the Among Us maps like the back of my hand. I have my next Among Us themed start-up: a Cams station at Harvard-Yale to spot your friends when your Find My Friends app is failing you.
All in all, we recommend you immediately start playing Among Us. The longer you play, the more you’ll realize the game is eerily similar to life at Harvard. Also, we’ve long passed the banana bread and Tiger King phases of quarantine: if we’re descending into a spiral of murdering one another right now, what does this mean for the rest of quarantine?
