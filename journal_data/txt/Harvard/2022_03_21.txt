After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was first introduced to the Harvard Undergraduate Council at a Virtual Visitas information session last year. I was an energetic high school senior at the time, ready for a new beginning and eager to get involved in the Harvard community. I had already decided that I would not run for a position and would just attend the session to listen in — I served on student council in high school and thought it was time to explore different activities and aspects of student life. But, as I watched UC members talk about truly important issues, I gained a deep interest in and respect for the organization.
I learned about a UC campaign that raised thousands of dollars for anti-racism initiatives in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. Statements calling for Harvard’s fossil fuel divestment and condemning human rights violations in India. Subsidy programs that make college life a bit more affordable and grants that allow student groups to plan events and bring Harvard together. It seemed to be a highly effective and meaningful vehicle for change; a platform for advocacy and crucial discourse about the student experience. I believed it was student organizing at its best and wanted to be a part of it — that is until I was elected as a representative and attended my first meetings.
I quickly realized that I had been thrusted into an incredibly tense and divided institution with deep cutting political — and personal — history that I knew nothing about. At one of our first meetings, a heated debate over a proposed budget revealed what would define my time on the Council: an intense power struggle between various factions that essentially ruled out any form of collaboration from the start. You could feel it in the room: the stares, the side conversations, the passive aggressive — and sometimes just aggressive — speeches. First-years were looked at only as votes, meant to be won over with promises of power and prestige in exchange for unconditional loyalty. It was a harmful and purely unproductive environment dressed in formalities to appear functional.
I remember walking into a team dinner early on in the term and having to choose between two tables, each occupied by a different clique. I delicately swayed from one to the other, hoping not to get caught up in any drama. That was exactly my approach going into the term: to act as a connector, a facilitator. To try and push the agenda along by encouraging dialogue and communicating across groups. To be on no side but yours. And that was my approach heading into a contentious UC presidential election last semester. I had been told about potential campaign rules violations and started working with a team of Council members to protect the integrity and fairness of the elections process. But, as election day approached, it became clear that election fairness was not the only goal in mind for some around me.
You see, UC politics are a poison — but an addictive one. Every meeting boasts something new to strategize about and fight over. It’s fast-paced and closely watched by the student body. That kind of attention can easily distract from real work if taken the wrong way. Amidst all the Crimson articles and angry Slack messages, it’s easy to lose sight of why the UC exists in the first place: to give students a voice in Harvard’s leadership and a say in its direction. As those around me set their sights less on that truth and more on the presidency, I too felt myself slipping away from you and the values I promised I would hold dear. And that is why I’m resigning: the UC brought out the worst in me. As soon as I started looking at other members of the Council as political opponents instead of fellow students, I knew that I had lost touch with what I care about and had to step away.
The current administration is right: the Undergraduate Council is broken and needs to be reimagined. But the problem isn’t an overly long constitution: it’s the toxic culture that pins students against one another — a culture its leadership has only reinforced with divisive and inflammatory rhetoric. The UC has accomplished so much before and can be something great; the way to fix it is not to point fingers, but to refocus on what matters. To engage all UC members and students in the decision-making process. To knock on doors and set up tables to hear from people around campus. To embrace change and look forward. We, the student body, must show up to Council meetings and participate in the upcoming constitutional referendum, use UC resources and influence to advocate for progress and reclaim it as an open student forum. It can no longer be an exclusive and disconnected club for a select few.
So, while I won’t be casting votes as a representative any longer, you’ll still find me in the Smith Center on Sundays participating in the democratic process and holding those who represent us accountable. Join me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The world order based on cooperative security and globalization became severely threatened on Feb. 24, 2022, when the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, an independent and increasingly democratic nation. As Ukraine fearlessly fights for its future, the Harvard community has expressed its support by conducting an anti-war rally and amplifying the voices of Ukrainians on campus.
Indeed, Harvard is known in the United States and abroad for this kind of advocacy. From raising emergency aid for displaced Afghans after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan  to taking a strong stance on racial injustices during the Black Lives Matter protests of summer 2020, Harvard students, as the citizen-leaders of tomorrow, lead the opinions in human rights circles nationwide and create an impact beyond campus. But today, the Harvard administration and the activists within the student body must be even more proactive in their advocacy for the Ukrainian cause, human rights, and global security than ever before.
The war in Ukraine is a unique 21st-century case of a people’s fight for the right to determine their future against an enemy that is several times larger. Ukrainians have inspired the world with their ability to withstand the attack for so long.
What lies behind this determination are the values that every American holds dear. Ukraine prides itself on the unlimited freedoms to peacefully protest, criticize the government, and elect its public servants. Even as some neighboring post-Soviet countries slid back into authoritarianism, Ukraine managed to stay democratic, and its people have never been intimidated by a more powerful bully.
Back in 2014, when the pro-Russian government restricted the right to protest, hundreds of thousands went to the streets, fighting for their right to speak out. Ukrainian people put their lives on the line then — and continue to do so today — because democracy and the freedom to pursue your own social, cultural, and political development are at the center of the Ukrainian identity.
The Harvard student body should stand for Ukraine by using the privilege that Ukrainians are dying for: the democratic right to pressure the government for action. Students should write and call their local representatives and urge them to announce their support for Ukraine. The entire Harvard community must demand that elected officials speak out about the need for broader humanitarian and defense assistance and request support for a no-fly zone, an area over which Russian aircraft are not permitted to fly. This restriction entails shooting down Russian violators and will prevent Russia from using warplanes to attack civilians on the ground.
Action is urgently needed to prevent massive human rights violations. Vladimir Putin’s quest for dominance yields unprecedented violations in Ukraine, and the country is presently on the brink of one of the biggest humanitarian crises that Europe has seen within the last few decades. Ukrainians trapped by Russian attacks lack food and supplies, and there have been allegations of rising sexual violence in cities occupied by Russian invaders. Additionally, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations has alleged that Putin prepared a list of LGBTQI+ persons to be killed or sent to camps if he takes over Ukraine.
Companies in the United States that work with or in Russia indirectly support this immense suffering. The Harvard community should boycott companies that have ties with the Kremlin, and the student body should request that companies they work for restrict any business relations or partnerships with companies operating in Russia. The Harvard administration needs to release information on whether the University has any indirect investments in Russia, and if any exist, suspend those immediately.
Lastly, activists must act now to prevent a war in other European countries. Putin has not only laid out a threat to Ukrainian borders but also put forth a vision of an imperial Russia. In his November 2021 address to the Russian people,  Putin stated that some republics that were once a part of the Soviet Union have unjustifiably been given independence, forcing us to confront the inevitable question: Who is next? Which other independent European country will Putin destroy in his quest for power? Will he lay a claim on Baltic countries that were formerly a part of the Soviet Union, and are presently a part of NATO? Harvard students must join protests and show support to Ukraine not only for the sake of Ukraine, but also to prevent a catastrophe in other European countries.
The leaders of tomorrow should not stay idle in the face of this global danger. As a proud Ukrainian American, I offer Harvard a clear call for activism: Everyone in this community must use their power to stand for freedom, protect humanity against an emerging authoritarian regime, and help defend world peace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Goodbye, Roe: the Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative majority is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade by the end of the term. These six conservative Justices recently seemed inclined to discard decades of precedent in their support for a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a decision could set the Supreme Court up to legitimize a raft of state-level abortion bans: from a Texas law putting a bounty on the heads of abortion-seekers, to an Oklahoma law prohibiting abortion 30 days after the “probable” start of a pregnancy.
You might think that none of those states are Massachusetts, that we’re safe here. In the short-term, you might be right: Massachusetts has some of the widest abortion access in the country. Eighty-seven percent of Massachusetts women live in counties with abortion clinics. Abortion pills are accessible through telemedicine. Abortion is even a covered service under the Harvard University Student Health Program. If Roe were overturned tomorrow, Massachusetts residents would still be protected by the state-level ROE Act, which permits abortions after 24 weeks when deemed necessary by a physician and lowers the age of abortion without consent from a parent or judge from 18 to 16. These are important provisions and we should be grateful for the activists who pushed for them.
But reproductive justice protections in nearby states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are not as comprehensive. In a post-Roe world, Boston will be an oasis for abortion care. Patients will need airfare, child care, and places to stay. They may need help covering legal fees back home. Many Texas women, after being denied abortions at home, got them anyway in neighboring states: One Oklahoma clinic, for example, has seen a 10-fold increase in Texan patients since the Texas law was passed. A comparable increase in abortion caseloads in Massachusetts would strain existing support networks and demand the creation of new ones.
That’s assuming the pro-life movement stops at overturning Roe. But it won’t. Mail-order medication abortions, a lifeline for Americans who cannot access clinics, are being targeted in red states. States with bounty-oriented laws like Texas and Missouri are attempting to expand their laws past state boundaries, punishing those who return home after seeking care out-of-state. In encouraging individual citizens to turn in their neighbors, and those who help them, in exchange for money from the state, these efforts echo centuries-old fugitive slave laws. The language of a proposed Missouri law even parallels that  from the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850: “It shall be unlawful for any person to perform or induce, or to attempt to perform or induce, an abortion on a resident or citizen of Missouri, or to aid or abet, or attempt to aid or abet, an abortion performed or induced on a resident or citizen of Missouri, regardless of where the abortion is or will be performed.” It is no coincidence that the modern versions of such laws will be applied disproportionately to marginalized women of color. Black women are already five times more likely than white women to seek an abortion; punitive laws like Missouri’s will only perpetuate racial disparities in health services.
You might think all of this is the inevitable direction of our divided, post-Trump society. But it’s not. A majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases, a belief which holds across geography, race, and most religions — including 83 percent of Jews, 68 percent of Hindus, 60 percent of mainline Protestants, and even 48 percent of Catholics. Since 2000, at least 31 countries have expanded abortion access; only three have rolled it back. In the past years, we have watched pro-choice activists celebrate in the streets of Dublin, Bogotá, and Buenos Aires. Our country could be moving in this direction, too — if only we started to act.
We simply cannot sit still or feel complacent in the relative safety of our state. It’s time to start having difficult conversations about abortion access in all our communities. The National Coalition of Jewish Women has a great toolkit for broaching those conversations with religiously conservative relatives. Make a donation to the Eastern Massachusetts Abortion Fund — or even better, volunteer. Join other Harvard students and Boston-area activists in their calls to action. We have a lot to do, and a lot to lose.

This piece is a part of a focus on Women’s History Month. While reproductive justice holds significant weight in women's history, many people who do not identify as women also seek and receive abortions.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64 received the 2022 Holberg Prize — dubbed the Nobel Prize for social science and humanities — for her prolific academic efforts in the field of science and technology studies.
A recipient of three Harvard degrees and a prolific writer, Jasanoff has authored or edited 18 books and penned more than 130 chapters and articles over the course of her career. For her work, Jasanoff has been described as a “pioneer” of science and technology studies, per a press release announcing the prize on March 14.
“The most basic question I have tried to address is what difference it makes that we humans live in scientifically and technologically advanced societies,” Jasanoff said of her work in the press release. “This is fundamentally a question about the meaning of science and technology in the everyday lives of individuals, social groups, and nations.”
The Holberg Prize — an award funded by the Norwegian government — will be presented to Jasanoff during a ceremony at the University of Bergen in Norway on June 9. She will receive a sum of approximately $675,000 as part of the award.
In an interview on Sunday, Jasanoff said she learned about winning the award after waking up to a “strange” missed call from an international phone number.
“The thing that went through my mind was that this was the proverbial early morning phone call from a Scandinavian country that I’ve read about with Nobel Prizes forever,” she said. “But one doesn't expect to have that kind of an experience in the humanities obviously.”
A member of the Holberg Prize committee later called Jasanoff back to deliver the announcement.
In a press release, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote that he was “thrilled” Jasanoff won the Holberg Prize.
“I am especially proud that the Kennedy School has been a home for her pathbreaking work that explores how policy, society, and law can play a role in scientific and technological decision-making,” Elmendorf wrote. “Sheila has been instrumental in defining and developing the science, technology, and society field.”
Roger Strand, a professor at the University of Bergen who has worked closely with Jasanoff, said her award is a win for her entire field.
“It also says something, I think, about the importance of natural science and technology,” he said.
“Of course, literary studies are important, they will always be important,” Strand added. “But in order to understand contemporary society as a humanities scholar or as a social scientist, you really need to pay some attention to the role of natural science and technology.”
Jasanoff attributed the award in part to her establishment of the Science and Democracy Network, an annual gathering of young scholars in the science and technology studies field.
“This is partly a recognition of non-scholarly activities as well,” she said. “This award both makes that work more prominent, but also provides some foundations for enlarging it.”
Jasanoff said she hopes that she will be able to use the award to make the annual gathering accessible to more people.
“We’ve never had the funding to really open up the membership to people from the Global South and people from poorer countries, people from universities that are not as rich as Harvard and can’t find travel money for their students,” Jasanoff said.
Strand said he thinks Jasanoff’s award is “so well deserved.”
“She could have gotten it some years ago, I guess, but you never know with these things,” he said.
“It’s like with a Nobel,” Strand added. “It takes the time it takes.”

Acclaimed filmmaker and former Nieman Foundation fellow Brent A. Renaud was killed on March 13 by Russian forces in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, while filming Ukrainian refugees fleeing from the war.
Renaud, age 50, was an American journalist who produced award-winning documentaries with his brother Craig. The Renaud brothers’ work often spotlighted the costs of conflict and included coverage of the ISIS invasion of Iraq and cartel violence in Mexico. Other work tackled drug addiction in New York and Arkansas and homelessness in New Orleans.
Renaud spent the 2018-2019 school year at Harvard through the Nieman Fellowship, which gives journalists the opportunity to audit classes, attend workshops, and forge relationships with other fellows. During the fellowship, Renaud studied the ways mental illness affects poverty and violence in America.
Renaud was shot while working on an assignment for Time Studios about the global refugee crisis. He was filming alongside journalist Juan Arredondo, another Nieman fellow, who survived the attack with injuries.
Over his career, Renaud and his brother produced films for many media organizations, including HBO, the New York Times, PBS, Discovery, and VICE.
Jeffrey S. Newton, a television producer who was Renaud’s colleague and friend, said though Renaud was outwardly “quiet and reserved” he was also “relentless” in his work.
“He was always up early, hours before anybody else,” Newton said. “He just didn’t have it in him to sleep a lot — he was always thinking about the next thing to do.”
Renaud was rarely outwardly opinionated and instead used his documentaries to express his political views, Newton said.
“He let his films do the talking for how he felt about things,” Newton said. “You want to know about how he feels about economically disadvantaged people in the United States — you only have to go back and watch his films.”
Newton said Renaud was just as talented an interviewer as he was a videographer. He recalled the way that Renaud’s “supremely basic questions” led to compelling responses from a soldier while filming in a warzone.
“The way he went about getting those stories told, I just sat sort of in awe of how good he was,” Newton said. “This is a guy that wherever I go around the world — not only can I trust him and I love working with him — but I’m going to learn from him for a great number of years.”
Mami K. Renaud, Renaud’s sister-in-law, wrote in an email that the Renaud brothers were like “night and day” and “moon and sun.” Brent, who was more introverted, differed greatly from Craig, a “social butterfly.”
“Together, they created a perfect portrait of what society really looked like. How people really were. What war was really like,” she wrote. “In order to shine a light on a hidden issue or problem of our world, you actually needed sun and moon.”
Nieman Foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski said Renaud’s work showed “extraordinary patience,” citing the Renaud brothers’ work on their movie “Dope Sick Love” — during production, the filmmakers spent the night in a holed-off building with heroin addicts.
“He never rushed a story,” Lipinski said. “There was just a real kindness to the way he went about his work, even in the toughest and most challenging circumstances.”
Renaud was born in Memphis, Tenn., and grew up in Little Rock, Ark. He graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1994 and received a master’s degree from Columbia in 1996.
“He found his love for filmmaking in the place that he grew up in. And I think that gave him a special ability to look at people similarly, without any pretense of what he felt about them,” Newton said.
The Renaud brothers collected many awards for their work, including a duPont-Columbia Award for “Arming the Mexican Cartels,” a film about how guns from the U.S. fueled cartel violence, and another for “Surviving Haiti’s Earthquake: Children,” a film detailing the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
They received the Peabody Award in 2014 for “Last Chance High” — a documentary series about a Chicago school for students with severe emotional disorders.
Still, Newton said Renaud only “reluctantly” accepted the many awards his films garnered.
“He really cared about humanity, and it was never about money for him, it was never about fame,” Newton said. “He hated those kinds of things.”
Steve B. Almond, an author who taught the narrative nonfiction class for Nieman fellows, said he was originally surprised to learn Renaud’s medium was film, not print, because he was such a talented writer and reader.
“He didn’t speak a lot in class, but you had the sense that he was listening and absorbing everything very deeply,” Almond said. “People really leaned forward when he spoke.”
Almond recalled an “astonishing” long-form piece that Renaud wrote for the class about facing difficulties finding his place during his upbringing.
“I think he’d gone through some tough situations in his own life and had converted that into a real effort to tell stories that made other people feel what it is like to be a troubled youth, for instance, or what it’s like for people who are in terrible circumstances,” Almond said.
Kaeti R. Hinck, a Nieman fellow in Renaud’s class, described him as “a great human” who always “surprised” those around him.
“He was incredibly kind, incredibly funny, and he was sort of a soft-spoken, quiet guy, but had a very mischievous sense of humor,” Hinck said. “Any time you talked to him, you would learn some new, wild story about his life.”
Hinck said Renaud emphasized getting to know his subjects and would stay in touch with them after the camera stopped recording.
“He really wanted to know the people whose story he was telling,” Hinck said. “And that meant walking alongside them and sitting with them in some of the most painful moments of their lives.”
“He deeply and genuinely cared,” she added.
Renaud was loyal, courageous, and sensitive, friends remembered. He loved animals and had a dog named Chai. He deeply valued his relationships with his family and was especially close to his nephew Taiyo.
“Brent Renaud was the best uncle in the whole wide world,” Mami Renaud wrote. “I know he would have happily died for my son. Anything to protect him.”
In addition to traveling the world to work on his many films, Renaud devoted time to mentoring a younger generation of journalists at Harvard.
In the spring of his Nieman Fellowship, Renaud mentored students on the Multimedia Board of The Crimson, helping them create portfolios through photography critiques and providing advice on pursuing careers in journalism and honing their craft.
Former Crimson Multimedia chair Kathryn S. Kuhar ’20 said Renaud was “very generous in his time,” adding that his mentorship was an “incredible opportunity.”
“He spent hours teaching a bunch of college photojournalists and videographers about professional journalism and about storytelling, and about how to really get to know sources and tell those stories,” Kuhar said.
Sara Komatsu ’23-’24, Craig Renaud’s niece, fondly recalled Brent — whom she called a “big inspiration” — reaching out to her after she learned she had been accepted to Harvard.
“He was very kind and generous and open to giving me all the advice that you could possibly give,” said Komatsu, a Crimson Arts editor.
Hinck said Renaud “exemplified” the “community building and friendship” aspect of the Nieman Fellowship.
“He always showed up, whether it was for a presentation, or somebody’s birthday, or just grabbing drinks after a long week,” Hinck said. “He’s the kind of person that would just be there and be there for you.”
Nieman fellow Tanya N. Ballard Brown, who first met Renaud through the program, said she remembered a trip she took to New York City for a standup show where he offered to host her at his home and even drove her to the door of her gig.
“I know when people pass away, people tend to focus on all the good things about them, no matter what the course of their life [was], but I don’t know anything bad about him,” Ballard Brown said. “Everything you hear about him is true.”
Renaud is survived by his brother Craig Renaud; his sister, Michele Purifoy; and his parents, Louis Renaud and Georgann Freasier.
On March 14, Ukrainian president Volodymyr O. Zelenskyy shared a letter expressing his condolences to Renaud’s family and said the people of Ukraine were also “mourning” his loss.
“May Brent’s life, service and sacrifice inspire generations of people all around the world to stand up in fight for the forces of light against forces of darkness,” Zelensky wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 is expected to face questions from Republican senators at confirmation hearings this week over her post on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, a potential conflict of interest in the challenge to affirmative action at Harvard that the court is set to hear in the fall.
If confirmed, Jackson will be the first Black woman, the first former public defender, and the 18th Harvard Law School graduate to serve on the Supreme Court. She currently serves as a federal appellate judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Since 2016, she has also served on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body. Her term is set to expire later this spring.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, composed of 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans, will hold her confirmation hearings beginning Monday. Each senator on the committee will get time to question Jackson on Tuesday and Wednesday before the committee hears from other witnesses and legal experts on Thursday.
With the Supreme Court set to hear a pair of challenges to race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina in the fall, GOP senators will likely question Jackson about whether her role on the Board of Overseers would warrant a recusal in the cases, experts anticipate.
Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told the Washington Post he plans ask Jackson if she would recuse herself in the Harvard case.
Experts are divided on whether Jackson’s time in Harvard governance warrants a recusal from the case.
Because there is no evidence that Jackson was involved in crafting Harvard's admissions policies, New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said he believes Jackson would not have to sit out the case.
But Gabe Roth, executive director of watchdog group Fix the Court, said Jackson’s six-year term on the governing board — as well as her dozens of trips to Harvard and close ties to the institution — would create the perception of impartiality.
“To me, if there is a perception of bias, that is akin to actual bias under the strictures of the federal recusal law — it says a justice shall recuse in any case in which his impartiality might be questioned,” he said.
Stetson Law Professor Louis J. Virelli III said Jackson should not recuse herself if her tenure on the board did not involve direct oversight over admissions policies. He noted the steeper “institutional cost” of recusal in the Supreme Court than in lower courts, citing the importance of a nine-member court for the high-profile case.
Gillers said he expects Jackson will not clearly answer in the hearings whether she will recuse herself in the Harvard affirmative action case or “any legal question that is now or may come before the court.”
“I suspect that she will just say, ‘If I’m confirmed, I will consider my ability to sit and I will review any motion to recuse me, and I will treat the issue of recusal with great seriousness as I always have,’” he said.
As a federal appellate judge, Jackson voluntarily recused herself from 12 cases — including two because of her role on the Harvard Board of Overseers, according to her Senate questionnaire.
Senators have also said they will question Jackson on her time as a public defender, during which she represented four Guantánamo Bay detainees.
Gillers said any attacks on Jackson based on her work as a public defender sets “a terrible precedent” given that the U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment guarantees defendants the right to legal counsel.
“The idea that she’s somehow tainted because she helped the country fulfill its constitutional obligation is anathema,” he said.
After the hearings conclude on Thursday, the Judiciary Committee will vote on Jackson’s appointment. If approved, the committee will send the nomination to the full Senate for consideration.
If all 50 GOP senators oppose Jackson's nomination, she will need the support of all 50 Democratic senators and a tie-breaker vote from Vice President Kamala Harris to be confirmed. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson before Congress leaves for Easter recess on April 11.
Gillers said he believes Jackson will be confirmed, possibly with some Republican support.
Virelli noted that in recent years, Supreme Court confirmation votes have fallen along party lines — a trend he calls “regrettable.”
“There is no significant enough reason, in my view, to vote against Judge Jackson on the basis of her qualifications,” he said.
“For decades, we had very, very few close votes, and now we seem to have close votes every time someone is nominated to the court — and I don’t think it’s because the credentials of the nominees are in any way weaker or less obviously meritorious,” Virelli added.
Correction: March 22, 2022
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the Senate Judiciary Committee is made up of 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans. In fact, the panel is made up of 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 200 people gathered at Harvard Square’s Sanctuary Theater on Sunday to watch Cambridge for Ukraine, a performance and fundraising event organized by Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre Dance for World Community.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui addressed the audience, alongside Harvard’s Ukrainian Research Institute publications manager Oleh Kotsyuba, University of Massachusetts professor Darren Kew, and activist Brian Corr. The performances featured numerous types of dancing as well as St. Andrew’s Ukrainian Orthodox Church Choir.
José Mateo’s Ballet Theatre organized the event in partnership with ArtsBoston, Cambridge Arts, Cambridge Community Foundation, Cambridge Community Television, and the Harvard Square Business Association.
Corr — who is involved with the ballet theatre — said the idea for the event came just two weeks ago, during one of the theatre’s community dance programs.
“It just so happened that one of the two main dancers is a native of Ukraine,” he said. “We have come together to support the people of Ukraine – to stand in solidarity, to gather together for peace, to use the arts for healing.”
In her remarks, Siddiqui reflected on Cambridge’s diverse history.
“Cambridge is a very welcoming and global city — it's long been home to immigrants from all over the world, home to a culture of protest and outspokenness,” she said. “It’s one of the many things that make me a proud Cantibridgian.”
The event followed a public art demonstration by local artists Ross Miller and Yolanda He Yang. Miller and Yang wrapped the Charles Sumner statue on Massachusetts Avenue in a tarp in solidarity with Ukrainians who have taken to wrapping statues in their cities to prevent the their destruction.
“This project is an insignificant yet heartfelt effort to transfer an image from Lviv, Ukraine to Cambridge, Massachusetts — a tiny symbolic action,” Miller said in a press release.
Illyana Sawka, a member of the St. Andrews Church Choir, said their participation in the Cambridge for Ukraine performance was an “honor.”
“It was also really important for us that Ukrainian culture be represented because we have a beautiful, beautiful and rich culture, and I think we need to not let the war outshine the voices of our community and what we have to contribute,” she said.
The songs the choir performed, Sawka said, held particular significance.
“Many Ukrainian folk songs are about exile and about conflict,” Sawka said. “Those are songs that unfortunately we learned from our grandparents, and our parents, and, unfortunately, are still relevant today.”
As of Sunday evening, Cambridge for Ukraine had raised roughly $19,000 of their $30,000 goal in donations for humanitarian non-profits supporting Ukraine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of stocks in the Harvard endowment has slowly crept back up in recent years after the Harvard Management Company sold off the vast majority of its public holdings when N.P. “Narv” Narvekar took over as its CEO.
When Narvekar arrived at HMC — which manages Harvard’s investments — in December 2016, the University’s endowment directly owned 79 public securities, making up roughly 2 percent of its total portfolio. The school sold off most of its stocks over the following year, bringing the total number of public holdings in the endowment down to just 10 by December 2017, when they made up 0.3 percent of the endowment’s total.
But following the initial sell-off, the endowment has begun to invest in the public market more, according to a Crimson analysis. As of December 2021, HMC directly owned 46 stocks, again making up just over 2 percent of the endowment.
Narvekar took over as head of the endowment as Harvard’s returns were severely lagging behind peer schools. He instituted a five-year restructuring plan that sought to wind down HMC’s “hybrid” investment model, under which it retained a large in-house investment team while hiring external managers to oversee investments.
At the start of Narvekar’s five-year plan, HMC laid off roughly half of its staff. The restructuring plan ended early, in 2020.
HMC is required to disclose its direct public holdings to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission each quarter because it controls over $100 million in assets. The overwhelming majority of the endowment, though, is invested through third-parties and not disclosed publicly.
HMC is not alone in investing much of its money through third-party asset managers. Yale’s endowment — the second largest in the country, behind Harvard — directly held just 12 securities as of its latest public filing. Stanford’s endowment invested directly in 42 public holdings at the end of last year.
Aaron S. Yoon, an accounting professor at Northwestern University, said he believes HMC is “narrowing down their focus” following Narvekar’s round of initial layoffs.
Harvard Business School finance professor Luis M. Viceira said the drop in the total number of direct holdings in HMC’s public portfolio could be attributed to increased talent in active management.
“The growth in active management has [made] it much, much harder for endowments to hire and retain talent internally,” Viceira said. “That talent has been progressively leaving.”
The proportion of Yale’s endowment that is directly invested in the public market has largely been below Harvard’s. Over the last nine years, Yale’s direct public holdings have frequently made up less than 1 percent of its endowment overall.
The composition of HMC’s direct holdings also differs significantly from those of Yale and Stanford.
HMC’s direct public investments have largely been in the technology and biopharmaceutical industries, including household names such as Meta Platforms — formerly known as Facebook — and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.
Yale and Stanford, however, invest heavily in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are managed funds composed of many different securities. Throughout Narvekar’s tenure, however, ETFs have consistently made up only a small portion of the Harvard endowment’s direct public holdings.
Yale’s largest direct public holding — Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF — accounts for almost $363 million of the $530 million in its investment portfolio.
Similarly, Stanford’s top two securities, which are ETFs specializing in emerging markets, make up almost half of its public holdings.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and the chief investment officer of Beacon Trust, wrote in an email that most ETFs are “passive in nature,” meaning they are unlikely to outperform the market.
Yoon, the Northwestern professor, said the current composition of HMC’s direct investments show the company is “confident that they can do stock picks and they know who the winners are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74 will speak at Harvard's joint Commencement ceremony for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 this spring.
A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, the Chicago native served as chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and held various positions in the Department of Justice before being tapped for its top post by President Joe Biden. In 2016, Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama, but Senate Republicans denied him a confirmation hearing. Biden nominated him in 2021 as the 86th Attorney General of the United States.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow praised Garland’s wide-ranging commitment to public service in the Monday press release, including his supervision of the investigation and prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombings — a domestic terrorist attack that killed 168 people and injured scores.
“From his unfailing resolve in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombings, to his widely respected service as a judge, to his leadership at the Department of Justice, he has demonstrated deep devotion to the rule of law and to the cause of justice,” Bacow said. “It is an honor to have him join us for what will surely be a memorable address.”
Early in his career, Garland served as a lecturer at Harvard Law School while he was a partner at the law firm Arnold & Porter.
Garland was also elected to serve on the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing board — in 2003. He presided over the body as its president during the 2009-2010 academic year before leaving the board when his term expired.
Harvard will host two Commencement ceremonies this year — one for the Class of 2022 on May 26 and a separate belated celebration for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 on May 29.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is set to address Harvard’s Class of 2022 at the first of the two ceremonies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team punched its ticket to the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in the last seven years on Saturday with an upset 3-2 overtime victory over No. 6/6 Quinnipiac in the ECAC championship game.
Harvard freshman Matthew Coronato stunned the top-seeded Bobcats (36-6-3) nine minutes into the first overtime of Saturday’s conference title game with a game-winning goal that secured the Crimson (21-10-3) its 11th Whitelaw Cup.
Harvard will face No. 1/1 Minnesota State on Thursday in Albany, N.Y., in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.
Harvard defeated RPI and Clarkson in the ECAC playoffs before hoisting the Whitelaw Cup after the championship victory over Quinnipiac.
The conference victory comes after the Crimson missed two consecutive seasons due to Covid-19.
“I think we learned what it means to not have tomorrow,” said junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson, who made a career high 47 saves on Saturday to keep the Bobcats’ high-powered offense at bay.
“I think that it just gives us a little bit more gratitude going into each game and each time we even get on the bus with each other,” he added. “We all missed each other a ton last year so, yeah, a ton of gratitude and just thankful we got in this position alone, to win it is just unbelievable.”
The Crimson went into Saturday’s conference championship as underdogs against the Bobcats, which entered the contest with a league-best 18 conference wins. But Harvard rode rock-solid goaltending from Gibson and a game-winner from Coronato past Quinnipiac in a back-and-forth thriller that took place in front of a crowd of 4,478 at Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y.
“[They] gave us more than we could handle tonight. … I’m very proud of our guys for sticking with it and battl[ing] through some adversity in the game,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Some guys banged up, but very proud we were able to find a way to win the game.”
Harvard came out hot, scoring the first goal of the game just over one minute after the opening faceoff. Junior defenseman Ryan Siedem banked a shot in off a Quinnipiac defenseman to put the Crimson on the board early. Senior defenseman Marshall Rifai was credited with an assist.
The lead wouldn’t hold for long, however, as Griffin Mendel evened the score for the Bobcats, capitalizing on a two-on-one rush just over four minutes later.
Quinnipiac maintained an aggressive and tactical offense, outshooting Harvard 49-17 in the contest. The Bobcats pulled unconventional moves such as pulling goalie Yaniv Perets (14 saves) for an additional skater multiple times during the first period — a strategy often kept for desperate third period situations. But the move paid off following both instances: Harvard junior forward Baker Shore was sent to the box. Harvard’s penalty kill unit diffused both advantages to keep the game tied into the second, led by junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson, who recorded a career-high 47 saves in the game.
The physical back-and-forth play continued in the second period. The teams each had unsuccessful power-play chances early in the first period. But just under nine minutes in, the Crimson was given a second chance that it was able to execute. A cross-ice pass by Harvard freshman forward Matthew Coronato found first-year defenseman Ian Moore, who buried the puck behind Perets to give the Crimson a 2-1 lead. Harvard was forced to defend for much of the remainder of the period, but fended off the Bobcats offense to maintain a one-goal lead going into the final frame.
Quinnipiac entered the third on the attack, determined to even the score. It dominated possession, barely allowing Harvard a chance to possess the puck. Gibson and the Crimson defense held strong until first-year forward Alex Gaffney was sent to the box for high sticking 13 minutes into the period. Perets, the Quinnipiac goalie, was again pulled for the extra skater, giving the Bobcats a 6-on-4 advantage. Bobcats defenseman Jayden Lee scored less than a minute into the power play to tie the game at two with about six minutes remaining in the game.
Possession remained in favor of Quinnipiac for the rest of regulation, but it was unable to find a game-winner.
In overtime, the Crimson was able to equal the Bobcats’ aggression. Harvard overcame a Shore hooking penalty, holding Quinnipiac to only one shot during the man-advantage.
Then, just over nine minutes into the extra frame Moore found Coronato, who lifted the puck into the top corner of the net, over Perets’ shoulder, to send the Crimson to the NCAA tournament.
“Ian Moore made a great little drop pass and I honestly just tried to get it on and off my stick as quick as I could,” Coronato said of his game-winner. “The puck kind of had eyes and finally found the back of the net.”
The freshman’s goal allowed the Crimson to lift the Whitelaw Cup in triumph, euphoria, and pride.
“It's an unbelievable feeling,” Coronato said. “Playing with great players, we got a lot of great players up and down our lineup, so it's a lot of fun to be with this group, a lot of heart in our room. … Unbelievable feeling.”
In its sixth straight trip to the conference semifinals, the Crimson faced off against the No. 14/15 Clarkson Golden Knights without a key player, as junior forward John Farinacci missed the contest due to injury. However, Harvard was still able to get off to a strong start on offense. Just over four minutes into the game, sophomore forward Sean Farrell rocketed a slap shot into the back of the net to give the Crimson the early 1-0 lead.
However, despite the strong start, Harvard was shorthanded twice in the first period, going up against the Golden Knights ECAC-leading power play unit that converts at a 23.3 percent clip. After killing off sophomore defenseman John Fusco’s holding penalty, Clarkson cashed in on Siedem’s tripping infraction, knotting the game at 1-1 at the end of the period.
At the outset of the second period, the Crimson’s top line of Farrell, Coronato, and junior forward and captain Nick Abruzzese, continued to generate offense. Abruzzese was eventually able to capitalize on the momentum, batting a loose puck out of the air for the 2-1 lead eleven minutes in.
Clarkson’s power play continued to produce, as it tied the game again after Harvard was whistled for too many men on the ice. Forward Zach Tsekos put the Golden Knights in front 3-2 just over three minutes later to put Harvard’s season on the brink going into the second intermission.
In the defining period of the season, the Farrell-Coronato-Abruzzese line continued to shine, scoring three goals in the third period to send the Crimson to the championship game.
Just over four minutes into the period, Abruzzese rebounded a Farrell shot, poking it home to tie the game at 3-3. The game remained tied until the last five minutes, when Abruzzese made a no-look, backhand, cross-ice pass to a streaking Coronato, who hammered the puck through Haider to put Harvard up 4-3.
Coronato later tallied an empty net goal with 11 seconds left to ice the game at 5-3. Coronato and Abruzzese each finished with two goals and two assists, while Farrell recorded a goal and two assists.
In a thrilling quarterfinal series that saw two overtimes at Bright-Landry Hockey Center last weekend, Harvard defeated the RPI Engineers two games to one to advance to the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
In the decisive game of the series, the Crimson and the Engineers fought in a tight defensive battle for the right to move on in the ECAC tournament.
Despite being forced into action by two penalties within the first seven minutes of the game, Harvard’s penalty kill unit withstood the threat behind Gibson’s strong play, keeping the game scoreless going into the back half of the first frame. Then, with just under six minutes remaining until the first intermission, junior forward John Farinacci received a pass at the Engineers’ blue line and made a strong move around the RPI defenseman, cutting to the net and roofing a shot past goaltender Jack Watson, putting the Crimson in front 1-0 at the first intermission.
Harvard carried just over a minute of power play time into the second period, and junior defenseman Henry Thrun made a pass from below the goal line to senior forward and captain Casey Dornbach, who fired the puck past Watson just as the penalty expired to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead.
Both teams tightened their defensive play throughout the remainder of the game, with neither team able to generate consistent offense. With under four minutes remaining in the third period, RPI created a six-on-four opportunity, pulling Watson for the extra skater after first-year defenseman Jack Bar was sent to the penalty box. The Engineers converted the six-on-four to slash the Harvard lead to 2-1, but Coronato added an empty netter to secure the 3-1 victory and send the Crimson to Lake Placid.
In a back-and-forth affair, RPI kept its season alive with a 4-3 victory in double overtime. Harvard jumped out to an early 2-0 lead before the halfway mark in the first, with Farinacci and Thrun both tallying goals. However, Engineers forward Justin Addamo sliced the Crimson lead to 2-1 with a goal three minutes after Thrun’s.
Neither team scored in the second period, as both teams were strong defensively. Midway through the third period, however, RPI stormed back on the offensive end to take a 3-2 lead. Just under eight minutes into the third, the Engineers’ tied it at 2-2, and less than four minutes later, took the lead.
With just over two minutes remaining, the Crimson’s top line answered the bell, as Coronato skated down the left wing and fed a backhand, cross-ice pass to Abruzzese, who rifled a shot through Watson, tying the score at 3-3 and sending the game to overtime.
The first overtime period proved chaotic, as Harvard was forced to kill off an early tripping penalty to Moore andAbruzzese was denied by Watson on a point-blank chance in front of the net. The Engineers had a golden opportunity after Farrell was given a five-minute major penalty for interference, but the Crimson penalty kill rose to the occasion, preventing an RPI score and sending the game to double overtime.
Needing a goal to move on to the semifinals, Harvard was unable to capitalize on the opportunity, as less than 90 seconds into the second overtime, Addamo and forward John Beaton converted a two-on-one odd man rush to win the game 4-3 for the Engineers and force a Game 3.
In a thrilling series-opening win, Harvard mounted a late third-period comeback to take a 1-0 series lead over the Engineers.
RPI forward Ture Linden opened the scoring on a power play halfway through the first period, firing the puck past Gibson for the 1-0 lead. Linden scored again off the post at even strength early in the second period to give RPI a 2-0 lead, and forward Rory Herrman extended the Engineers’ lead to 3-0 just over two minutes into the third period.
With Watson standing tall throughout the game, the Crimson failed to get on the scoreboard until Ted Donato pulled Gibson for the extra attacker with four minutes to play. Rifai cut the lead to 3-1 with a slapshot, and Siedem trimmed the deficit to 3-2 with just under two minutes to play. With the clock ticking down under 20 seconds to play, Coronato answered the call and hammered home a rebound, tying the game at 3-3 and forcing overtime.
Carrying its late third period surge into OT, Harvard secured the Game 1 victory only two minutes into the extra period, as senior forward Jack Donato deflected Thrun’s shot past Watson for the win, sending the Crimson pouring off the bench to celebrate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s baseball team split a four-game series at California Polytechnic State University last weekend. Cal Poly kept Harvard’s offense quiet Friday night and during the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday. The Crimson’s offense woke up for the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader to win its first game of the series. The Crimson put on another strong offensive performance to win the last game of the series on Sunday.
Coach Bill Decker said in an interview Friday that he believes part of the reason why Harvard (8-6) struggled in the first two games of the series was because of the team’s long trip to California from Cambridge.
“I think the biggest thing was just the travel factor, coming off the midterm exams,” Decker said. “We left campus at six o’clock on on Thursday night, and really didn’t get into a hotel until one o'clock in the morning.”
“We weren’t really sharp on Friday night, but I thought we played well on Saturday and Sunday,” Decker added. “Guys are resilient, guys kind of persevered through some stuff and got a couple victories.”
The Crimson was shutout by Cal Poly (9-9, 2-0 Big West) on Friday night as it dropped the first game of the series 5-0. The Mustangsstarted sophomore right-handed pitcher Drew Thorpe, who threw a complete game shutout. Thorpe struck out 11 batters, allowed zero walks, and gave up only three hits over 118 pitches.
Harvard started junior right-handed pitcher Adam Stone, who lasted only four innings. Stone had trouble finding the strike zone from the start of the game. With two outs, Stone walked three consecutive batters in the bottom of the first inning before getting the next batter to ground out to strand the bases loaded.
The game remained scoreless until the fourth inning. After retiring the first two batters he faced, Stone again loaded the bases on walks. The next batter hit a routine fly ball to right-center field that should have ended the inning, but junior center fielder Hunter Baldwin and sophomore right-fielder Ben Rounds nearly collided attempting to make the catch, allowing the ball to drop and two runs to score. Rounds was charged with an error on the play.
Over the four innings he pitched, Stone gave up one hit, three unearned runs, and nine walks while only striking out two. Freshman right-handed pitcher Tanner Smith pitched two strong innings in relief, striking out four batters while allowing no runs, hits or walks. Sophomore right-hander Porter Jordheim came in to pitch the seventh and eighth innings where he also struggled against the Cal Poly lineup. Jordheim gave up two earned runs and allowed four walks and two hits while striking out two.
The Crimson’s offense managed to get 11 hits against the Mustangs during the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader. Nevertheless, Harvard mustered only one run as it dropped the second game of the series 10-1 in what junior captain Logan Bravo called a “tough loss.”
Junior left-handed pitcher Tim Williamson started for the Crimson. Harvard fell behind early after Williamson gave up a solo home run in the bottom half of the first inning. In the fourth inning, Williamson gave up six runs — including a grand slam — which gave Cal Poly a 7-0 lead.
Williamson gave up seven earned runs, five hits, and five walks over his five innings of work to earn his first loss of the year. Junior right-hander Ian Buckner allowed one run over two innings of relief and senior right-hander Joseph O’Connell gave up an additional two runs in one inning of work.
Despite recording 11 hits, the Crimson’s offense was mostly silent during the first game on Saturday. First-year second baseman George Cooper was responsible for Harvard’s only run of the game. Cooper led off the top of the seventh inning by smashing a solo home run to left field. Harvard stranded 13 runners on base, including leaving the bases loaded in the seventh inning.
In the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the Crimson managed to hold off the Mustangs and win its first game of the series.
Harvard took the lead early in the game. Cooper led off the top of the first inning for the Crimson and reached base on an error. He managed to get into scoring position on a passed ball and quickly scored after the second hitter of the game, sophomore left fielder Chris Snopek, hit a single to drive Cooper home. Later in the inning, Bravo laced a double down the left-field line to extend Harvard’s Crimson’s lead to 2-0.
The Crimson started senior right-hander Jaren Zinn, who gave up one run over six innings. Zinn struck out 11 Cal Poly hitters and allowed only four hits and two walks to earn his second win of the season.
During the top of the fifth inning, Baldwin reached base on a walk. Cooper then grounded out to first base, allowing Baldwin to advance to second. A batter later, Snopek tallied his second RBI of the game, driving in Baldwin with a single to right field. In the sixth inning, Harvard extended its lead to 4-1. Rounds singled to left field and quickly stole second base to get into scoring position. Baldwin hit a single down the left field line to drive in Rounds for the Crimson’s fourth run of the game.
Cal Poly attempted to stage a comeback in the bottom of the seventh inning, scoring two runs off sophomore right-handed pitcher Chris Clark. Clark only managed to record one out in the seventh inning before Coach Decker brought in sophomore right-hander Jay Driver to get Harvard out of the inning. Driver got two outs in the seventh and stayed in the game to pitch the eighth and ninth innings for Harvard. Over two and two-third innings, Driver allowed zero walks and one hit while recording four strikeouts to secure the win for the Crimson.
Harvard won the last game of the series on Sunday 9-4 to secure the series split against Cal Poly and win its second game in a row.
The Crimson started freshman right-hander Sean Matson in the series finale. Matson allowed two runs in the third inning and another two runs in the sixth inning across a little over five innings of work but still managed to earn his first win of the season.
Sophomore left-hander Uday Narottam came in to relieve Matson in the sixth inning and pitched three and two-thirds’ worth of scoreless innings to secure the win for Harvard and earn his first save of the season.
Cooper led off the game for the Crimson by reaching second base on an error. He managed to score the first run of the game after Bravo hit a single to right field — his fifth hit of the series — to drive in Cooper. An inning later, Harvard added two more runs on RBI hits from Rounds and Bravo to increase the lead to 3-0.
In the bottom of the third, Cal Poly scored back two runs, but in the next half inning the Crimson responded by scoring a run on a fielder’s choice. In the top of the fifth, Harvard increased its lead when Baldwin hit a double to drive home Rounds and sophomore shortstop Jake Berger. The gap was further widened in the top of the sixth inning as the Crimson scored an additional three runs, two of which came on a double hit by Berger that drove in Snopek and junior third baseman Will Jacobsen.
Bravo said that Harvard managed to come back to win the last two games of the series not by making any huge changes to their playing style, but just staying on the same path to victory.
“Honestly, it wasn't a huge adjustment,” Bravo said. “It was just trying to stay with it rather than freaking out.”
The Crimson traveled to Los Angeles this weekend to play a three-game series with UCLA to close out its California road trip. Adam Stone started the first game of the series on Friday, Tim Williamson started Saturday’s game, and Jaren Zinn started the series finale on Sunday.

Welcome back from break and welcome to our most-awaited and (admittedly) most-contentious piece of the year. The return to in-person Housing Day brings back new and better than ever Housing Day videos, but how do they stack up? We watched them all so you don’t have to. Here’s what some of our first-years think!
Note: When you have 12 fabulous videos to choose from and lots of people with opinions, there is going to be some ~disagreement~. We know how hard every house works to film, edit, and produce these videos. This might be our final ranking, but we’ll admit there is a very valid case to be made for other orderings too. Flyby Blog is signing off here, but for all our fans, the comments are open for debate 👇🏽👇🏽
Quincy
The winner of our Unofficial Housing Day Video Contest — QUINCY HOUSE! Right from the aerial shots to start, the editing and filming demonstrates nothing short of excellence. The lyrics are creative, informative, and overall, a bop. With Act I and Act II, “The People’s House” brought a thorough tour, a strong sense of community, and house pride until the end. #PenguinNation.
Mather 
Mather’s video had excellent camera work, and the editing deserves applause. We particularly enjoyed watching all the different parts of Mather in which the video was filmed, with features from the Faculty Deans, HUDS employees, and pets! From creative lyrics to video snippets of students just having fun, “Mather — that’s all we’re on.”
Lowell 
Can we say we’re surprised this video was absolutely amazing? True to its reputation, Lowell’s Housing Day video was nothing short of excellence. With a wholesome storyline, iconic dhall scenes, and lyrics that actually made sense, the video was easy to watch through to the end. The directing and editing was also great, with the telescope scene being our favorite!
Kirkland
Kirkland takes a silver medal with three great songs, strong vocals, and ~quirky~ concepts. With faculty members, students, and a mascot decked out in Kirkland gear — Kirkland’s video makes any first-year student jealous of the house’s infamous community. We applaud them for choosing songs other than rap and the stellar camerawork!
Currier
Currier’s video had a distinct beginning than the other Housing Day Videos. With intense animation and a voiceover, this video really gets your attention and then makes sure you stay watching! While they may have chosen one of many rap songs this year, this Currier pulled through with great rhythm and energy that may even make you regret not getting quadded!
Dunster 
Dunster comes in sixth with a Gen-Z approved song choice and a throwback, wholesome shots along the river, and features from HUDS employees! With cool illustrations, house pride, and an adorable opening from the Faculty Deans, Dunster House truly came together to show us that dark wood paneling and meese >>>.
Eliot
Introductory text to explain the situation was useful for freshmen, and the video starts out with strong — hype — energy. The snowball fight was a cute add-on, the house tour was gorgeous, and the lyrics & rhythm were entertaining. We wish this video would’ve dropped a little earlier, but with great camera work and good vibes, Eliot comes in with a solid ranking overall.
Cabot
With a music video AND a skit, this video had great shots and a cool concept. The lyrics and vocals were top tier, and somehow Cabot made the shuttle rides… aesthetic? Why are we convinced that the Quad-SEC Direct is the best part about getting quadded? Either way, Cabot succeeded in selling us on the #quadlife.
Leverett
Oh Leverett, we love your community! The censoring was hilarious and the transitions between songs were satisfying. It was just as good as scrolling on TikTok. As the only video to feature some Spanish, we give you points for being multicultural. The green bunny ears radiate positive energy, the carrot man in Berg was entertaining, and the love for Lev is evident!
Pfoho
The polar bears were in sync and adorable and turned an Industry Baby scene that was the opposite of wholesome into the definition of it. We wish we could have spent more time learning about the different amenities and common spaces in Pfoho, but the post scene and extended saxophone cuts added character so we appreciate the effort!
Adams
Adams gets bonus points for a storyline, capturing the freshman energy well, and for taking a unique approach to their video compared to other houses! With lighting techniques and solid camera work, this video definitely captured Adams pride and highlighted its famous dark academia-esque architecture.
Winthrop
Winthrop House brings puppies, babies, subtitles, the Winthrop lion, and the most wholesome song selections. We wonder if this video was filmed on an iPhone 6, but regardless, the number of people involved featured in it only proves how much Winthrop students love their community and their many river-facing courtyards!
With creative lyrics that tastefully shade other houses, more music videos than ever before, and hype mashups, we’re convinced that every house is a good one. We can’t wait to see what’s in store for us next year — the Class of 2025 is beyond hyped for house life already, and we are grateful to all the houses for giving us a Housing Day to remember forever!
Sections
Among the most overlooked parts of Harvard’s campus are its crosswalks. Crosswalks are essential to the way we move around. They keep us safe as we travel on foot to class and make sure we don’t get hit by bad drivers on Mass. Ave. But they are a lot more than that too. Each crosswalk has a different *vibe* that just makes it so unique. Read on to learn about Flyby’s favorite crosswalks on campus and why they’re the key to *romanticizing life*.
Barker-Lamont crosswalk
It’s giving English-concentrator-obsessed-with-dark-academia vibes. The direct path from Barker Center to the steps of Lamont just adds so much to the aesthetic of this crosswalk. The best feeling is crossing during autumn when the leaves crunch under your shoes and the Barker gates are majestically open ahead of you. If you want to somewhat romanticize your life instead of thinking of that midterm you have next week that you didn’t study for and don’t have the motivation to study for until the last minute panic sets in, try walking across this crosswalk! I highly recommend it.
In front of Smith Campus Center
Beautiful, immaculate, functional. Not only does this crosswalk actually have a pedestrian light, but it’s actually wide enough to comfortably walk across without passing too closely to other people. Its convenient location near the T, the Smith Campus Center, and the Yard makes it a crowd-favorite and a well-rounded queen. Use this crosswalk for the vibes as you flaunt your tote bag and casually walk into Smith to study with ~aesthetic lo-fi music~.
The crosswalk by the Harvard Book Store
The snow on either side of this crosswalk always seems to be the first to be cleared during blizzards. Rain, shine, snow—no matter what crazy weather Boston brings, this crosswalk is always there for you. Rustic, handy, and trustworthy. This crosswalk doesn’t need to try hard to be well-used and appreciated. It’s also on the way here to The Crimson, which gives it extra brownie points.
The trio of crosswalks by Quincy St. and Harvard St.
Why did the turkey cross the road? To be a menace to some innocent passersby, probably. The amount of times I’ve seen a turkey cross one of these three crosswalks is not even funny anymore. They causally strut across the carefully painted crosswalk like they own the place… Anyways, enough of my turkey slander. I will award some extra points because this trio makes me feel some type of way. Every time I walk across any of these three crosswalks, I have a main character moment. Picture this: it’s 7 PM, and it’s dark already. You’re hurrying back from yet another club meeting and crossing the street, when multiple cars approach the intersection from all three sides. They stop for you as you walk, bathed in the warm glow of their headlights. Just me?
The crosswalk between the Harvard Dance Center and Currier
I didn’t forget about the crosswalks in the quad, but I have thoughts. First of all, why does the light take so long to change??? I’ve literally waited five whole minutes in a snowstorm to no avail and then finally made up my mind to risk my life and just run across the street. This one even has a button you press to cross, but it does literally nothing. So I’m always having a staring contest with a random driver as I guiltily cross on a red light. Sorry, not sorry. It’s the button’s fault, and I’m impatient.
Some crosswalks are nicer than others but we do love them all. Whether you use crosswalks to run to your 9 a.m. or you’re staging a photoshoot to recreate The Beatles’ “Abbey Road,” our crosswalks are an integral part of Harvard’s campus. Next time, take some time to appreciate (or silently judge) the crosswalk upon which you walk. Happy walking!
