In Wake of Schrag Bullying Allegations, Harvard ESE and EPS Affiliates Call to Strengthen Anti-Bullying Policy
On April 11, nearly 5,000 students at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences were greeted with an unwelcome surprise: Our school was renamed the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, effective immediately.
After almost a year of celebrations for our 150th anniversary, the announcement was jarring, to say the least.
Since then, much has been written about how members of our community find Kenneth C. Griffin ’89’s ideological affiliations to be in conflict with our core values. But my objective is not to belabor those points. Instead, I want to explain why the way these events transpired was deeply unjust and hurtful.
As Shakespeare said, “that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Though its name changed overnight, our school’s people and their values haven’t changed. From this perspective, our frustration might seem unwarranted.
Yet every single person I’ve spoken to at GSAS — students, alumni, and administrators — has expressed a deep sense of injustice and hurt. This is because names do more than allow us to refer to people or things: Who and what we choose to honor in a name also expresses a commitment to values and causes, which can guide future action.
Thus, if we respect existing members of the community as stakeholders, they should be included in the decision-making process for something as monumental as the entire community’s renaming.
And you don’t have to take it from me.
In a 2020 message to the FAS community regarding the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard President-Elect Claudine Gay described the Harvard administration’s process of deciding who and what to memorialize, writing: “Honest and rigorous conversations about how we weave together our past, present, and future through our visual culture and symbols are necessary to build the stronger, more equitable future we envision.”
And yet, without any “rigorous conversation” with GSAS students, those same administrators changed our name — the most public “symbol” of our school.
This raises the question: How was such a blatantly unjust decision allowed to happen, and why did it happen to us?
For the past three years, I’ve worked alongside many student leaders and administrators to improve GSAS students’ lives as a GSAS Student Center Fellow, as an executive on the Graduate Residence Hall Council, and as the secretary, vice president, then president of the GSAS Student Council. I’m sad to say that no one I work with was surprised that we were abruptly renamed.
For as long as I’ve been a leader, GSAS students told me that they feel like second-class citizens at Harvard. And that’s by design: An administrator explained to a group of us recently that we can’t expect equal treatment with the College because alumni of the College donate more money.
We see this dynamic play out every day. For instance, when GSAS students were pushed out of the College House system in 2019, we lost access to intramural sports. This hurt: Athletics are an invaluable way to build community and promote mental health, something many graduate students struggle with.
Since then, we’ve consistently pushed for athletic opportunities, but made little headway. Students resort to workarounds like cross-registering at MIT just to get access to athletic facilities because Harvard Athletics won’t let our groups use theirs. And although the University committed to creating a graduate IM league by Fall 2021, the single staff position charged with leading that effort was not filled until October 2022.
Another thoroughly exhausting fight has been about renovating the GSAS Student Center at Lehman Hall, the only space GSAS students can call their own. Much needs to be done: For example, many wheelchairs can’t fit in the building’s elevator, and a lack of power outlets makes it difficult to work there.
A 2021-22 feasibility study included concrete plans for renovation. But despite our support, it has been frustratingly difficult to get any indication of when — or even if — they might be approved. Recently, we learned that the plans would be delayed by another year.
Yet, Harvard has already spent over $800 million renovating the College Houses. The amount proposed to renovate Lehman Hall is a small fraction of that.
This history makes us incredibly skeptical about how much of Griffin’s $300 million gift will go into supporting GSAS directly as opposed to FAS or the College. Yet it’s us who got renamed, reinforcing the message that we’re worth less to Harvard. We’re reminded of this message every time we see the new name.
A particularly painful downstream effect of the renaming is that our student groups and programs will likely have to be renamed accordingly. For example, Figure Skating@GSAS, a group that means a lot to me personally as a symbol of our commitment to student wellbeing outside of academics, will most likely become Figure Skating@Harvard Griffin GSAS. None of our traditions or sacred spaces will be left unscarred.
I’m not writing this with the intent to push for a particular solution. I don’t know if there’s a good one. But students at GSAS and the administration need to talk.
The GSAS community deserves to know how the decision to rename us was made, and how the gift will benefit GSAS. We need Harvard to acknowledge the hurt that has been inflicted upon us, and to commit to conversations going forward not only to address that hurt but also to prevent similar injustices in the future.
Surely, we deserve that much.

In Wake of Schrag Bullying Allegations, Harvard ESE and EPS Affiliates Call to Strengthen Anti-Bullying Policy
When I was a junior in high school, I visited Harvard for the first time. Like all bright-eyed potential applicants, I shuffled around campus, following the lead of a student tour guide whose feigned enthusiasm about Harry Elkins Widener’s famous book collection now seems comical.
These tours are meant to offer high schoolers an inside look at Harvard College. The problem is that the impression one gets from these tours is hardly representative of life at the College. Sure, you may get a sense of the literal facts of student life. But the underlying social reality as a Harvard College student — its intangible flavor that isn’t easily put into words — is left hidden.
Four years after visiting Harvard for the first time, I’ve once again found myself in the same place. As a prospective law school applicant, I recently went on a walking tour of Harvard Law School’s campus. Yet this tour did little to satisfy my curiosity regarding life as an HLS student.
The moment when I felt I really did get a deeper understanding of HLS was last semester, when I embarked on my Board Plus-sponsored tour of Harvard’s dining halls. I didn’t learn anything about the history of the Caspersen Student Center or the structure of law school classes. I did notice the little things, though — how well-dressed the students were, or the Latin maxims written in gold lettering high up on the walls of the library.

The same went for all of the graduate schools I visited on my Board Plus spree. At each, I noticed the particulars of the underlying force and flavor that constituted each school. 
For the past three months, this column has attempted to peel back that tour-esque veneer and reveal the intangible culture of each postgraduate school.
It has completely failed in doing so.
Here was the original idea: I’d interview students from every graduate school, gathering anecdotes from each and using them as launching points for a full-scale investigation of the school’s culture. I imagined myself wandering the campus, allowing myself to discover what it really felt like to attend said school.
Yet when I sat down to write each piece, pages of interview transcripts in front of me, I couldn’t help but feel lost. Quotes, pictures, and notes sat in a jumbled mess on my screen. Somehow, they had the audacity to remain meaningless and unconnected, instead of autonomously organizing themselves into some easily digestible narrative that I could then transpose onto my document.
I expected the narrative to jump out at me, but instead I found myself frantically rearranging ideas to fit into a ready-to-publish message. Whenever I heard conflicting information, I wasn’t sure whom to believe. Was this person’s unique description of the Kennedy School just an outlier, or was it the tip of an entirely new narrative I could pursue? I hurriedly tied off loose ends, knowing that if I pulled on one, I risked unraveling the entire article.
The feeling was familiar to me. I’d felt the same way writing essays for class. My Social Studies papers became the product of arbitrary choices entirely unsupported by evidence — or at least supported by very selective quotations. If I found a case study that disproved my thesis, I’d turn the other way, only looking back to include it as a counterargument that I could spin to my advantage. While writing my essays, I never felt like an unbiased vessel for truth. Instead, I was a fraud, molding facts to fit my message.
Pressed against a deadline, I could stand these moments of fraudulence. When it came time to consider what I would write my thesis about, though, I had a tiny crisis. I knew I couldn’t spend months of my life on a project that deep down I recognized was completely without merit.
I dreamed of being swept away by the facts, of my preconceived notions being shattered by unquestionable observations and data. That attitude, and a couple articles of this very good column, led me to enroll in an econometrics course and economics tutorial at the start of this semester. I coveted the lives of Applied Math/Economics concentrators and the analytical rigor with which they approached the world.
Yet a semester later, I leave with the same dissatisfaction I began with. Econometrics, it turns out, wasn’t the answer to my doubts. I had underestimated the extent to which this field was constrained by the same limitations I had felt elsewhere. Any question I asked was shaped, reshaped, and trimmed down by the availability of the data and existing statistical methods. Every result came with an asterisk. In the end, I found myself appreciating the cleverness of studies’ research designs more than their actual conclusions.
In his magnum opus, War and Peace, Leo Tolstoy writes, “Man’s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man’s soul. And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says: ‘This is the cause!’”
Perhaps that is the situation in which we find ourselves. Gifted with the desire for truth, but cursed with the inability to ever find it, we are locked in a never-ending struggle. Is the only solution to break the loop and eschew this effort altogether?
I’ve certainly thought so at times. On the Editorial Board, we opine on a minimum of three topics a week. To inform our discussions, we rely on a very scrupulous agenda put together by our Editorial Chairs. Yet at these meetings, I always find myself wondering if a little more information or a couple more facts could completely shift the direction of our staff-editorials. We deal with complex topics, and it would be naive to think that in the hour we have to discuss, we’ve properly digested enough information to truly understand the situation and offer an accurately critical assessment of it.
The Crimson is a megaphone, and what’s more dangerous than handing a megaphone to those with reckless, uninformed opinions? Perhaps it would be better to not write at all. At times, I’ve been hard-pressed to think otherwise. Given the imperfections present in our capabilities of understanding the world, why risk it?
I’m still on the Editorial Board, though, and I’ve continued writing this column. The reason isn’t because I’ve found a way to be entirely confident with my opinions on our graduate schools. Instead, it’s because I’ve found a different way of viewing them altogether.
If I were to look back at every piece I’ve ever written for The Crimson, there’d be none that I’d be fully confident of. Even for those that, emotionally, I might be fully committed to, I would logically accept the numerous counterarguments that could well be made against my position.
I don’t write this column to convince people of my strongly held beliefs. In fact, if someone entirely agreed with me, I’d feel unaccomplished. Instead, I write to start a conversation about the other schools on this campus, to inject my words into a discourse that I hope is made more effective because of them.
Think about those often championed as society’s ‘greatest thinkers.’ We read them not to be persuaded by them, but to learn new ways of thinking, to build on imperfect ideas. The only way to come to terms with the limitations of our reason is to humbly recognize the role of our writing: as small cogs within the larger machine that is our discourse.

Amid Intense Internal Dispute, Harvard Graduate Council Votes to Remove Finance Chair, Alleging Misconduct
As many of us prepare to leave the hallowed halls of Harvard University, we’ll bring the skills we’ve learned into a world that needs them — badly. After all, the value of our education isn’t solely defined by the knowledge we gain, but by how we use it to better serve others. I hope more of us consider dedicating our talents and wisdom to a career in public service.
This hope is shared by the very grounds of our campus. Located on Massachusetts Avenue, just across from the Harvard Bookstore, is a gate named after one Samuel Dexter, Class of 1890. Dexter, “a natural leader by all with whom he came in contact,” was president of his class at Harvard. When he graduated from this esteemed institution, he, like all of us, was expected to be a leader in the world. Tragically, his story ended just four years after his graduation, in 1894, when he died from cerebral spinal meningitis.
Upon its erection in 1901, an inscription by then-Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, was carved on the outside of Dexter Gate: “Enter to grow in wisdom.” Over the last 122 years, tens of thousands from this institution have uniquely embarked on that mission.
I remember being called to this journey like it was yesterday. It was 2020, the height of the Zoom era, and I had just finished attending a remote community meeting.
Three years earlier, in 2017, I had been elected to office on the Jersey City Board of Education. My election made me the youngest Muslim elected official in America.
In January 2021, a year after I arrived at Harvard Law School, I was elected as the president of the Jersey City school board. My mandate was to reopen the schools as the pandemic came to an end. I thought I had a lot of wisdom by that point, but little did I know what awaited me beyond Dexter Gate.
The next month, on the eve of my 24th birthday, I was diagnosed with stage four cancer. I can still remember the shock and fear that washed over me when I received the news. My whole world turned upside down in an instant. Suddenly, everything that I had planned for my life was in jeopardy, and I was overwhelmed by a sense of deep uncertainty about the future. I felt like I was in a daze, like I couldn’t process the information the doctor had just told me.
I was scared, angry, and sad all at the same time, and I didn’t know how to cope with my emotions. I remember asking God, how could this happen to me? How could my passion for public service be so meaningless in the face of nature?
I’m sure Samuel Dexter felt a similar sense of disbelief when he was diagnosed.
But I got the chance that Dexter never did. In August 2021, I officially beat stage four cancer.
A month later, in September 2021, our first month back on campus after the pandemic, I got to walk through Dexter Gate again. This time, my eyes were drawn to the inscription that greets your gaze as you leave the Yard: “Depart to better serve thy country and thy kind.”
Our lives on this Earth are limited. Often, I hear those at Harvard suggest that we should worry about ourselves first and society later. But my journey has taught me to embody Harvard’s mission as soon as I leave its gates — to serve others by spreading the quest for veritas, the pursuit of the truth. Our time on Earth is too short to do otherwise.
We have had a great privilege bestowed on us. We are fortunate to be reminded of it every time we enter the gates of Harvard University.
Now I ask you, how will you depart? Will you use your wisdom to grow your personal fortunes and wealth? Or will you decide to contribute to the greater good and better serve thy country and thy kind?
Hopefully, your growth in wisdom will make your decision as easy as mine.

In Wake of Schrag Bullying Allegations, Harvard ESE and EPS Affiliates Call to Strengthen Anti-Bullying Policy
On the wall in my childhood home hangs my great-grandmother’s family tree. It’s in a gilded frame, but in a back room, both revered and ignored. I remember looking up at it as a child, intrigued by the legend at the bottom: Yellow star indicated “Commissioned Military Officer,” blue star meant “Patriot of the Revolution,” and squiggly underline signified a “Founder of Family in America.”
These were things I was taught to be proud of.
Years later, while an undergraduate, I joined a fossil fuel divestment campaign. It was students of color who began to teach me the deeper roots of the climate crisis. Hearing about colonialism and racial capitalism for the first time, I couldn’t help but draw links between those topics and my own family. Some of my ancestors were founders of American families; others were bankers, lawyers, or captains of ships and industry. Both of my grandfathers worked on Wall Street.
Soon it became clear to me: I have personal divestment work to do.
I joined Resource Generation, a national network of young people with wealth and class privilege who organize in partnership with poor and working class-led movements to redistribute money, land, and power. In RG, we have a practice of telling “money stories”: the too often unspoken narratives behind the racial wealth gap in this country. I learned to see how my family’s good fortune had been bolstered by generations of Ivy League degrees and country club connections — the boarding school to boardroom pipeline.
As I revisited that family tree with RG, it wasn’t long before I uncovered dozens of stories of my ancestors’ participation in the founding injustices of this country: colonization and slavery.
One of those ancestors has a house at Harvard named after him.
In the top left corner of my family tree appears Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, my tenth-great-grand-uncle. Winthrop believed the aristocracy should justly rule, that religious dissenters should be banished, and that God had chosen some to be rich and all others to be poor.
He also took the Massachusett tribe’s territory for his own, personally enslaved Native people, and helped write the first law legalizing slavery in North America. Winthrop is said to have declared one of the first “thanksgivings” in 1637, as a celebratory feast after the Mystic Massacre: An estimated 700 Pequot men, women, and children were burned alive, with any who tried to escape the flames shot on sight. In 1638, while the colony was under his leadership, a ship named Desire brought enslaved Africans to Boston for the first time.
This is not an ancestor to be proud of. Yet Harvard has made Winthrop unavoidable. From Winthrop House to the larger-than-life statue in Annenberg Hall, his legacy and likeness are memorialized, valorized, and uplifted. I encounter him almost daily, as do thousands of other Harvard students, many of whose ancestors were directly victimized by mine.
In February, the Generational African American Students Association, in collaboration with Natives at Harvard College, submitted a request to dename Winthrop House, accompanied by a petition which has so far accrued over 600 signatories. The request echoes much of the history the University has already admitted to, with the Winthrop name appearing 109 times in Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery report.
“The damage caused by Harvard’s entanglements with slavery and its legacies warrant action,” says the report. “Such action cannot possibly address the many complex and damaging legacies of slavery in and beyond the United States, but nonetheless, action is vital.”
As part of this public commitment to action, the denaming of certain buildings, professorships, and programs is a step Harvard can and must take. This is not about erasing history, but putting it in its rightful place — in history books, curricula, and museums — instead of it being a haunting presence in the daily lives of students.
Some of my family members accuse me of judging our ancestors by the standards of our own time. In response, I point to the small but important history of anti-racist choices by white people as evidence that a different decision could always have been made. In Winthrop’s time, it was Roger Williams, who wrote to him asking him to reconsider “perpetuall slaverie” of captives from the Pequot War.
Other family members have worried I am trying to break ties with our ancestors. To the contrary, I see this work of truth-telling as bringing me closer to them: Before I began talking about this history, the Winthrop name had been long forgotten in my family. Indeed, as I preached about at Harvard Divinity School last year, Winthrop’s story now motivates the racial justice work that I see as mine to do. By committing to transform and transmute the trauma he caused, I’m trying to prevent wealth inequality and racial violence from becoming the final chapter of our family’s legacy.
And I’m not the only one: So far, I and 44 of my fellow Winthrop descendants have signed on in support of GAASA and NAHC’s request.
“Our history demands a conscious, collective, emotional ‘knowing’ about the legacy of slavery,” say psychologists Bryan K. Nichols and Medria L. Connolly. “Otherwise, the moral wound of slavery will continue to persist.”
Harvard has allowed the moral wound of slavery to persist for far too long. Amidst nationwide efforts to obscure our country’s past, this University has a timely opportunity to step toward the right side of history. We must begin by listening to Black and Indigenous communities whose “knowing” about the impacts of our history has been for far too long ignored.
One step is clear: Winthrop must fall.

Harvard Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton will continue his tenure through Aug. 31 as the search for his successor continues, University President-elect Claudine Gay announced in an email to affiliates Tuesday.
Hempton announced his departure from the role in October 2022 and was set to leave at the end of the 2022-23 academic year. In the October announcement, Hempton, who joined HDS as a professor in 2007 and became dean of the faculty in 2012, said he would continue teaching at the school.
In the message, Gay described Hempton as a “wonderfully generous colleague” and praised the “care and skill with which he leads and serves the University.”
“It is a gift to all of us that he has agreed to prolong his departure.” Gay wrote. “I hope you will join me in thanking him today.”
Under Hempton’s leadership, the Divinity School underwent the renovation and subsequent reopening of Swartz Hall, the school’s main campus building. The renovation project modernized the facility and included the renaming of its chapel in honor of Preston N. Williams, the first African American tenured faculty member at the Divinity School.
Hempton also expanded the school’s multireligious educational offerings and diversified the faculty. He appointed more than a third of the current Faculty of Divinity, including professors focused on African and African American religion, Islamic studies, and early Christianity and its connection to Judaism.
Gay, who will assume Harvard’s top post in July 2023, inherited the search for Hempton’s replacement and three other deans who announced their departures at the end of the current academic year.
The other searches include appointing new deans of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, Harvard School of Public Health, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
As the academic year comes to a close, none of the open deanships have been filled with permanent successors, though Gay announced last week that health economics professor Jane J. Kim would serve as interim dean of HSPH during the search.

Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and former U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry discussed the global climate crisis with outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow at the inaugural Harvard Climate Symposium on Tuesday.
The Harvard Climate Symposium, sponsored by the recently formed Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, took place at Harvard Business School and included three other panel discussions centered around the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across academia, industry, government, and civil society.
The symposium is part of Harvard Climate Action Week, running from May 8–12 and featuring programming from more than eight of Harvard’s schools, including Harvard Law School, the Kennedy School, and the School of Public Health.
It also marks the first major event of the Salata Institute’s Climate Action Accelerator, a nonpartisan platform supporting research and discussions on climate-related issues.
During the talk, Kerry discussed the responsibility of countries with larger economies to “lead the way” in the energy transition, noting that “there are 20 nations in the world responsible for 76 percent or so of all emissions on the planet.”
“The United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, the EU, UK — they’re actually pursuing real plans to keep the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees,” Kerry said. “The problem is China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and others are not yet there.”
“Our challenge is to bring them on board as fast as we can to help them, to be able to reduce those emissions at a pace that matches the 1.5 degree demand,” he added.
When asked about the recent U.S. endorsement of the COP27 Loss and Damage Fund, through which countries responsible for the largest carbon emissions will provide financial assistance to vulnerable countries suffering from climate impacts, Kerry said “failure is not an option.”
“This is a matter of global equity and fairness. It’s a matter of environmental justice. We have a big responsibility,” he said.
But Kerry emphasized that the responsibility for climate action is not solely held by the U.S. and includes other nations that may also have large economies.
“We believe that a lot of this fight is going to center around, ‘Will some of those nations accept responsibility to share this burden?’” he said.
Despite questions about the durability of the U.S.’s climate commitments, Kerry said he believes “there’s no way we’re going backwards.”
“The global economy has made this decision, and it’s more powerful than any politician,” he said.
Bacow noted the role of the private sector in driving change in the climate crisis.
“Much of the drive for change in this country with respect to policy and climate change is actually not, at this point, coming from the government,” he said. “It’s actually coming from the private sector, from industry that, as you say, has made the commitment and is pushing things forward.”
Following years of activism and public pressure, Harvard announced in 2021 that it would move to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. In years prior, Bacow had publicly opposed divestment.
When asked about what universities like Harvard should be doing in the face of the climate crisis, Kerry said “divestitures have been a big issue on the table.”
“You have enormous investment capacity, you have enormous ability to affect thinking about where other capital is going to go, where it ought to go. Every major institution faces this choice right now,” Kerry said.
“One of the things that we need to do is get the fossil fuel industry to be part of the solution, not a centerpiece of the problem,” he added.

Madras Dosa Co., a chain specializing in customizable dosas, opened its doors last Friday with the goal of bringing South Indian food to Harvard Square.
Located on 22 Eliot St., the new establishment’s menu centers around the dosa, a crepe-like dish made of lentils and rice that is usually stuffed with savory fillings. The Harvard Square location is the second for the chain, which opened its first storefront in Boston’s Seaport district in 2021.
Koushik “Babu” Koganti, the owner and operator of Madras Dosa Co., said that plans to open the chain came about because Indian food, especially from southern regions, is “underserved” in America. “A lot of people think Indian food is chicken tikka masala and naan,” he said.
“Dosa has its own character, so we want to make dosa as big as it can go. That’s why we want to focus on one single dish,” Koganti continued.
The menu includes options to fill the dosa with a wide variety of vegetables and meats, as well as fruits for those looking for a sweeter option. The restaurant also serves rice pilaf, chaat, and sandwiches.
On expanding into Harvard Square, Koganti said that he believes dosa is “a great to-go for the students.” He added that he hopes the restaurant will attract “millennials who are health conscious, who love vegan food.”
Inside the restaurant, customers sit alongside a wall adorned with green foliage, highlighted with a pink neon sign stating, “Dosa is the Answer.”
“We want people to take pictures with this wall,” Koganti said.
Shreeja Kikkisetti ’25, a student at the College from South India, said she decided to eat at Madras Dosa because dosas were a “staple” for her at home. “I feel like it resembles very closely to what I’m very used to,” she said.
Rachna Gupta ’25 described the atmosphere in the restaurant as “very homely” and said she was excited by the opening, despite repeated delays to its opening.
“Me and my friends have been anticipating it opening, like I follow its Instagram page. I know there were some delays, which made us a little disappointed, but we're happy it's here,” Gupta said.
Madras Dosa’s opening saw a series of delays as the restaurant brought the space up to code and obtained permits from the City of Cambridge. The establishment initially sought to open its doors to students in December 2022 or January 2023.
Madras Dosa is open until 3 a.m. every day as Koganti hopes to add the dosa to the list of late-night options in Harvard Square.
According to Koganti, the chain is seeking to expand to major cities around the world, with a location on Madison Avenue in New York City set to open in a few months, as well as another along the Las Vegas Strip. Negotiations are also under way for a potential location in Paris.
“One billion people in India love it. From north to south, east to west, everybody loves dosa,” Koganti said.

Harvard University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen announced Monday that Harvard affiliates will no longer be required to obtain Covid-19 boosters, though students will still be required to provide proof of initial vaccination.
The change in University policy was announced ahead of the May 11 expiration of the United States’ Covid-19 public health emergency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention characterizes Covid-19 community levels as “low” and transmission levels as “moderate” in Cambridge.
According to Cambridge’s Covid-19 Data Center, which is set to cease updates on May 11, the city saw about 75 new confirmed cases of the virus over the last 30 days — though the data is limited to positive PCR tests, while testing has fallen sharply since the height of the pandemic.
The Department of Health and Human Services website states that battling Covid-19 “remains a public health priority” but that “we can transition away from the emergency phase.”
After May 11, the CDC will no longer collect or publish data on the number of positive Covid-19 cases or the positivity percentage at the county level, as laboratories will not be required to report these numbers. Additionally, health insurance companies will no longer be required to provide free Covid-19 tests.
The government will still provide free vaccines, and higher-risk individuals can still receive Paxlovid for free from their healthcare provider, pharmacist, or the government.
Harvard will also drop its requirement for proof of vaccination for new employees, though HUHS employees and other University healthcare workers will still be required to follow CDC recommendations for staying up to date on vaccination.
“I encourage all members of the community to follow the CDC’s vaccination guidance,” Nguyen wrote. “Thank you for continuing to diligently follow public health guidelines as they have evolved throughout the past few years.”
The end to Harvard’s Covid-19 booster requirement is the latest in a series of pandemic restrictions and protocols to be removed, with the University retiring its contact tracing team and Crimson Clear application in December 2022 — a move that drew mixed reactions from students. Harvard previously ended its Covid-19 testing requirement for affiliates in April 2022.
An HUHS spokesperson wrote that Harvard’s student health insurance plan will continue to provide eight free rapid tests per month for the remainder of 2023. It is unclear whether students on the plan will be able to receive tests after this year.
Employees enrolled in a Harvard healthcare plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield or the Harvard University Group Health Plan will only be able to receive four tests per month through their insurance beginning in July.
In the email, Nguyen encouraged Harvard affiliates to keep higher-risk individuals in mind.
“Vigilance remains important even for lower-risk, vaccinated individuals as long COVID continues to be a concern,” he wrote.
Nguyen noted that people aged 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised can now receive an additional bivalent booster. Harvard affiliates who qualify for the booster can receive it at a pharmacy or from HUHS.
He also urged caution ahead of Harvard’s 2023 Commencement events, recommending that attendees take a rapid test before activities and to not attend if experiencing Covid-19 symptoms.
“As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to monitor and adjust our guidance as necessary,” he added.

Endeavor and Harvard University announced the launch of Versity, a new online professional development learning platform, in a joint press release on May 2.
Versity will officially launch in June with three courses that are each co-taught by a Harvard professor and a celebrity actor affiliated with Endeavor.
Endeavor is a global sports and entertainment company based in Beverly Hills, California overseeing talent agencies, sports leagues, and brand marketing. Most notably, Endeavor maintains a controlling interest in the company that owns UFC and WWE, the premiere mixed martial arts and wrestling leagues.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that Versity is “a new opportunity for Harvard faculty to create high-quality short-form courses with new educational content for different types of learners whom Harvard faculty might not otherwise reach.”
The new platform is geared toward companies that seek to provide their employees with educational opportunities to build leadership skills. Versity is a collaboration between Endeavor and Harvard’s Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, a University administrative wing that focuses on online learning and innovations in education.
The collaboration with Endeavor to establish Versity will allow professors to share their expertise in a manner that protects the intellectual property of the faculty member and Harvard, according to Newton.
When Versity launches next month, three of Harvard’s most well-known professors will be the first on the platform: Government professor Michael J. Sandel and Michael B. Jordan will collaborate on a course about tech ethics; Harvard Law School professor Jody L. Freeman and Amy Poehler will co-teach a course titled “Purpose, Perspective, and Persuasion”; and University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Cynthia Erivo will serve as the instructors of “How to Bring the Real You to Work.”
Guy Schory, who serves as chief digital officer at Endeavor, said in the press release that Versity “combines results-driven pedagogy with world-class storytellers to bring a unique and engaging perspective to learning.”
“By combining leading global minds, creative talent, and a dynamic, interactive technology platform, we are creating a whole new way to develop the leaders of tomorrow,” Schory added.
Versity expects to unveil additional courses throughout the rest of 2023, according to the press release.
Harvard will use any proceeds it receives from the collaboration with Endeavor to support Versity’s course design and to reinvest in the University’s teaching and learning initiatives, according to Newton.
Versity isn’t the University’s first online educational partnership — the initiative is similar to the $30 million collaboration between Harvard and MIT in 2012 that established edX, an online learning platform that allowed users to take digital courses from the two institutions for free. The virtual learning platform was sold in 2021 for $800 million to 2U, Inc., a Maryland-based education technology firm — though the company’s stock price has since plummeted.
Gates said in the press release that he is “deeply honored” to be teaching one of Versity’s three inaugural courses.
“Since Socrates, great teaching has always been characterized by great storytelling,” Gates said. “Working alongside the brilliant actor Cynthia Erivo, we thread a wide range of riveting narratives into the fabric of our pioneering course on social identity and cultural authenticity.”

Harvard announced grants totaling $200,000 to 20 different organizations and programs in Allston as part of the Harvard-Allston Partnership Fund at a ceremony last Thursday.
The grant total is double the $100,000 that had previously been distributed every year since 2008, when the fund was founded as part of a cooperation agreement between Harvard and the City of Boston. The agreement allowed Harvard to begin construction for its planned expansion into Allston, including what is now the Science and Engineering Complex.
The permanent funding increase is part of a proposal by Harvard to the Boston Planning and Development Agency as the University seeks approval for further development at 92 Seattle St.
“Increasing Harvard’s contributions to this partnership fund during my last year in office was a wonderful way to demonstrate our commitment to the Allston-Brighton community,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who attended the ceremony, said in a press release.
Among the recipients were multiple summer camps and food pantries, a YMCA, a school parent council, an art gallery, and the Charles River Watershed Association. Grant sizes ranged from $20,000 to support a learn-to-skate program by Allston Brighton Youth Hockey, $15,000 to support instruction in string instruments at the Gardner Pilot Academy, and $5,000 to create a children’s “sensory space” at the Honan Allston library.
Heloisa M. Galvão, the executive director of the Brazilian Women’s Group, said her group — which received a grant of $20,000 this year — has received grants from the fund of increasing size for the past three years after finding out about it through the Allston-Brighton Adult Education Coalition.
“The grant from Harvard is crucial, because the way we see it, Allston-Brighton has become the largest Brazilian community in Boston,” she said.
Galvão cited the “extremely high” cost of living in the area, food insecurity, and a lack of job opportunities for immigrants without documentation or who do not speak English as issues her organization attempts to address and will devote the funding received toward.
“They come because they need clothes, because they need something for the kids, because they need food, because they need us to help them to fill out some papers, to read the letter that they got,” she said of individuals who seek help from the Brazilian Women’s Group.
She added that without external support from organizations such as Harvard, the organization’s work would be “extremely difficult.”
Karen Smith, a member of the fund’s advisory committee that reviews grant proposals, said the committee sought to award grants that reflect the diverse demographics in Allston.
“It was a nice way to get a cross-section of need and evaluate proposals that would come in,” she said.
Asked whether she believes the funding increase represents a positive step for Harvard’s historically fraught relationship with Allston, Smith said the fund is “completely standard — and what’s expected of anyone looking to do development.”
“It is very common when developers get permission from city governments to do any one of a number of things — like housing, commercial buildings, whatever — the package that is negotiated includes mitigation and community benefits,” she said.
Nevertheless, Smith said the money Harvard has contributed towards the fund is “well spent” and benefits Allston.
“There are going to be kids going to the West End summer camp that wouldn’t have gone before. There are kids getting music lessons in a school that doesn’t have a budget for music, and now they’re getting music lessons,” she said.

Harvard Police Chief ‘100%’ Backs Student and Alumni Demands After Leverett Swatting Attack

Harvard University Police Chief Victor A. Clay clarified the department’s response to an April 3 swatting attack at Leverett House in a Friday interview with The Crimson, expressing his support for written demands made by students and alumni in the wake of the incident.
In the interview, Clay acknowledged student criticism and said the University “dropped the ball” by not issuing a statement to students sooner. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana first emailed students about the swatting attack roughly 66 hours after it took place, drawing criticism from affiliates.
“A very vulnerable part of our community was targeted and affected by this incident,” Clay said. “I’ve said this before: We took too long to talk to them. There was this delay that I still don’t understand why it occurred.”
On the morning of April 3, four Black undergraduates in Leverett House were ordered out of their rooms at gunpoint by HUPD officers responding to a false 911 call from an individual claiming to be armed and holding a woman hostage.
Clay said that the reason a campus-wide alert didn’t go out during the time of the attack was because the situation “was confined to a very small space, and we already had the problem contained.”
“This thing that was being reported to us did not affect Longwood, or the Divinity School, or the Business School — it affected Leverett House,” Clay said. “So to send out an alert at three o'clock in the morning may have brought more people into the problem.”
Clay added that it was a “tactical decision” not to send a MessageMe alert to students.
Jarah K. Cotton ’23, one of the students in the Leverett suite, told The Crimson in April that she believes an email alert should have been sent, noting the threat posed by a potential shooter.
“They clearly, again, thought it was a serious threat because they had assault rifles pointed at our faces,” Cotton said. “I feel like if it warrants that kind of response, it most definitely warrants an email.”
In the interview, Clay also acknowledged a letter sent to administrators by 45 Harvard organizations in response to the swatting attack, which criticized the University’s response and listed five demands: a University-wide statement acknowledging the “significant racial impact” of the swatting, a thorough HUPD investigation, increased HUPD transparency and accountability, “proactive” mental health support, and an in-person town hall by administrators.
“I agree with it 100 percent,” Clay said. “I don’t think their demands were unreasonable at all.”
Clay, who came to HUPD with a pledge for reform, added that he supports holding a town hall “if it’s a fruitful conversation” and if administrators are willing to participate.
“You learn a whole lot from the community when you give them an opportunity to speak, right?” Clay said. “But if it’s just an opportunity for one or two folks with a very specific intent to shout you down or gain popularity on social media — not for it at all.”
Clay also stressed that “there’s a human side to both sides of this conversation” and that HUPD is “hurting” along with students over the incident.
“Every single officer involved in the Leverett House incident really wants to talk to the students because they are actually hurting right now,” he said. “The fact that they feel that they traumatized these students even more than being targeted by the caller — it affects the officers.”
Clay said after an HUPD meeting Thursday, officers told him that they wanted to talk to the students and explain that they are “not there to intimidate” or “hurt” them.
Clay added that he empathizes with the students involved due to his identity as a Black man.
“I am from the Black community,” Clay said. “I know what they’re feeling. I know exactly what they’re feeling.”
He added that he was frustrated that the department had been tricked into responding to the swatting call.
“This was a large hoax, and they’re playing this game across the country,” Clay said. “It really bothered me that he — first of all — got Harvard. He got us. And secondly, he’s gonna get a lot of — in whatever weird little world he lives in — a lot of credibility from doing that.”
Clay also addressed the use of assault rifles and riot gear by the HUPD officers who conducted the raid, saying that the department’s equipment is “appropriate,” though adding that he believes more training on their use is necessary.
“I don’t think we’re militarized at all. I think we have the weaponry that is minimally adequate considering the amount of violence in the United States, ” Clay said.
Asked about the January Cambridge Police killing of 20-year-0ld University of Massachusetts Boston student Sayed Faisal, Clay said he doesn’t believe any police department is “appropriately equipped” to handle mental health crises.
“I’m a huge proponent of a partnership with mental health professionals, whether they be embedded in a police department or responsible for a co-response model,” he added.
“We are all desperately waiting for somebody to take the lead on this and say we are no longer going to allow 911 — the police department — to be the primary responder to mental health crises,” Clay said of police around the country. “Somebody else has to come in and do this because by calling a cop to a mental health crisis, you limit the response.”
At the end of the interview, Clay expressed gratitude toward his staff for their “continued effort and diligence.”
“There have been some staff here who have given 100 percent effort to keep this department afloat and moving forward, and they are often not recognized,” Clay said. “They’re not thanked enough.”
“Culture change is tough,” he said. “But it’s not impossible. And if it’s not impossible, I’m going to do it.”

Harvard College Alum Ryosuke Takashima ’19-’22 Becomes Youngest Mayor in History of Japan
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana defended the College’s decision to begin charging students for Commencement housing in an interview Friday.
In late April, Harvard informed student group leaders they would have to pay $45 per night for each student they planned to grant extended housing — an option that was previously free. The announcement came just four days ahead of the May 1 application deadline.
Several student groups criticized the decision, which the school said was made to allow Harvard to provide meals to students, citing concerns in previous years over a lack of access to food.
Khurana defended the policy but acknowledged student concerns around the short timeline.
“It’s a very complex undertaking, and perhaps more complex than we maybe even initially anticipated,” Khurana said of the new policy. “We felt that it was important before this summer started — knowing what we had learned and heard from students about the importance of addressing the issues of food insecurity — that we address it this summer and not let it go for one more summer.”
In response to The Crimson’s reporting that some clubs had considered canceling their Commencement plans in light of the new policy, Khurana underscored that financial aid is available, and that students can reach out to the school with specific concerns.
“We recognize that this change, as with any change, can be a little bit disruptive to plans. We are trying to minimize that by having clear places for people to contact for questions,” Khurana said.
Khurana also expressed a muted reaction to a Crimson report that the Dean of Students Office is considering a proposal to temporarily freeze the creation of new undergraduate clubs. The DSO website states that the College has more than 500 student organizations, a number which Khurana said the school is seeking to verify.
“The accuracy of that is important for us,” Khurana said, deferring further questions to the DSO.
Khurana also addressed the following topics:
Earlier this month, Khurana announced that he had selected Harvard Kennedy School professor Erica Chenoweth and their wife Zoe Marks, an HKS lecturer in public policy, to serve as the faculty deans of Pforzheimer House beginning July 1.
“Erica and Zoe were so excited about the opportunity of living among and with the students and building on what is already an excellent house,” said Khurana, who made the final decision in conjunction with advice from House affiliates, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and President-elect Claudine Gay, and president Lawrence S. Bacow.
“When I received the comments from the students and tutors, staff who were on the search committee, what stood out for me was how people expressed their capacity to listen,” Khurana said of Chenoweth and Marks. “In particular, they emphasized a humanity and a desire, a real intent to listen — to understand rather than think about what to say next.”
Khurana attended a meeting last month with representatives of Black student organizations and other top administrators to discuss the University’s response to an April swatting attack that sent armed police to a Leverett House suite occupied by four Black students.
The meeting came after dozens of Black student organizations penned a letter to Harvard administrators outlining a list of demands, including a meeting with University leadership.
Khurana acknowledged the effects of the attack and said the College is focused on student well-being.
“Our goal as a Harvard community is to ensure the well-being of every student,” Khurana said. “I know it was a painful incident for the students who are impacted, but it had ripples beyond not only the impacted students or the students in one house, and beyond even the college.”
Although students present at the meeting said their demands were not met, Khurana said the College has plans to improve.
“The College committed to listen, and then from there learn and do better.”
With the Harvard College class of 2023 set to graduate later this month, Khurana expressed admiration for their resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“This is a group of students who took every version of the way we could possibly offer classes,” Khurana said of the graduating class. “They had to adapt and pivot. They had to figure out how to build community outside of the Harvard structure and then rebuild and renew it when they came back. They had to be a bridge of restarting student organizations. They also found ways to sort of think about new traditions and new ideas for their communities.”
“It’s really a remarkable group of students, and I’m very excited for them and their families and friends to celebrate what they’ve accomplished,” he added.
In early April, the Harvard Undergraduate Queer Advocates launched a petition requesting increased access to gender-inclusive restrooms in major academic and residential buildings on campus.
In the interview Friday, Khurana underscored the implementation of gender-neutral bathrooms as a priority as the school undergoes renovations and new construction.
“The College is committed to ensuring that every space that we have — academic, social, residential — feels inclusive to every member of our community. As we’ve been doing house renewal, we’ve really been trying to ensure a philosophy of inclusive design and universal design,” Khurana said.
“I think we’ve made some progress over the last few years, but there’s more work to do to make sure things are not only available, but that they’re convenient and provide the privacy and dignity every single individual deserves,” he added.
Correction: May 10, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that May 1 was the payment deadline for extended stay housing. In fact, May 1 was the application deadline.
