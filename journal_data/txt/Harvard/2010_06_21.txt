After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAIRO, Egypt—The preservation of antiquities in Egypt has taken great steps since the days that western archaeologists could make off with the best artifacts from their sites. The evolution of Egypt’s protection of its heritage is evident at Saqqara, less than an hour’s drive from downtown Cairo. Saqqara is famous for its step pyramid, the oldest pyramid in Egypt, as well as for its role as part of the necropolis of the ancient city of Memphis.
Archaeologists have excavated at the “City of the Dead” for decades, as the thousands of tombs mean a dig cannot miss. The only way for a dig at Saqqara to fail to find a new tomb or make a similar discovery, it seems, is to be shut down by the authorities. The Louvre’s excavation was suspended in 2009 after the Paris museum refused to return artifacts from a different site back to Egypt. Such a development would have been unheard-of in the earlier days of archaeology mythicized by Indiana Jones.
Egypt faces an increasingly difficult task in asserting its authority over its archaeological sites. The attempted repatriation of Egypt’s artifacts abroad will continue for the foreseeable future, and the country may find it necessary to repeatedly use the threat of suspending excavations for leverage.
Against the backdrop of these nationwide efforts, however, is the truth on the ground. When I recently visited the tombs of Saqqara, the guard informed my group access to the underground burial chambers, thousands of years old, was impossible. For baksheesh equivalent to a couple of U.S. dollars, however, visitors can enter the tombs, take any manner of flash photography, and even climb into a sarcophagus. The protection of Egypt’s antiquities at Saqqara may be improving on the macro level, but no one has bothered to tell the guards.

BATTICOLA, Sri Lanka—Travel veterans always tell me that street food is almost always delicious…if you’re willing to take the risk of grave and, frankly, embarrassing consequences. Walking around Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, with the lake shimmering in the distance, I couldn’t help but be tempted by the women selling “hoppers” on the streets. Squatting along the dirt roads, under the shade of trees, their workstations are littered with coconut shells. They work in the impossible heat, fanning the fire under the clay pots where “hoppers” are magically created. It’s a coconut milk and dough mixture, which is toasted on both sides. My mouth was watering as I watched others indulge—the warm, doughy inside and brown, crispy edges. The air was wafting with the soft smell of coconuts. Finally, I caved and bought one for 2 Sri Lankan rupees. The woman wrapped it in a sheet of newspaper and handed it to me. I can tell you that street food is delicious. And really, it’s not as risky as they say.

The Harvard Medical School has officially entered negotiations to receive $36 million in funding from its local hospital affiliates over the next three years, The Boston Globe reported Monday.
Unlike most other university medical schools, which own their local hospital and earn revenue from physicians and patient care, Harvard Medical School does not receive funding from its various local teaching affiliates. Instead, the school is funded through government grants and its share in the University endowment.
But the recent 27 percent drop in the University endowment last fiscal year has had a significant impact on the Medical School budget, which consists of 42 percent of funding from research grants and 29 percent from endowment income.
Recently in 2009, about 70 full-time employees were laid off or retired early, and the Medical School froze salaries. Daniel G. Ennis—executive dean for administration who announced Friday that he will be leaving the University for a post at Johns Hopkins University—told The Globe that the Medical School expects to break even or come close during the fiscal year that ends June 30.
Though the numbers remain to be finalized, over the next three years beginning on July 1, Mass. General will give the Medical School $11.1 million; Brigham and Women’s Hospital, about $9 million; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, $6.1 million; Children’s Hospital Boston, $5.1 million; and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, $1.5 million.
Harvard Medical School administration could not be reached for comment on Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Canada took on the United Sates for the gold medal in ice hockey at the 2010 winter Olympics, rising sophomore Louis Leblanc was one of nearly a dozen Canadians on the Harvard men’s hockey team rooting for their countrymen in hostile territory.
But while Leblanc and his fellow Canadians may have been outnumbered by their American teammates, it was the Canucks who got the last laugh when Sidney Crosby’s overtime goal gave Team Canada the 3-2 victory.
While Leblanc was only able to cheer on his compatriots from afar this past winter, the next time Canada goes up against the United States in international competition, Leblanc could be right there on the ice.
Early last week, Hockey Canada announced that Leblanc is one of 41 players invited to the development camp of Canada’s National Junior Team, where he will fight for a spot on his country’s roster for the 2011 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship.
The development camp, which will be held in Saint John’s, Newfoundland in early August, will give Leblanc a chance to compete against the top Canadian skaters in his age group.
Of the 41 skaters invited to the camp, Leblanc is one of 10 who were selected in the first round of the 2009 NHL draft, a group that also includes Brayden Schenn, the fifth overall pick.
If Leblanc makes the final roster, he will attempt to help Canada reclaim the gold medal after the Junior National Team fell to the United States, 6-5, in 2010, ending the team’s five-year winning streak. The 2011 tournament will take place in Buffalo, N.Y. from Dec. 26-Jan. 6 and could potentially overlap with Harvard’s schedule.
Leblanc is not unfamiliar with representing his country on an international stage. In 2008, Leblanc scored three goals as a member of the Canadian team that took gold at the under-18 Ivan Hinka Memorial Tournament.
During his first year with the Crimson, Leblanc lived up to expectations, notching a team-leading 11 goals and taking home the honor of the Ivy League’s top rookie.
