To capture the story of the band Queen and its legendary lead singer Freddie Mercury to a single movie is an impossible task. The British band’s ascendance to musical deification was one of historic proportion, producing more than 10 original albums, countless singles of epic quality, and an international phenomenon. Framed by the band’s historic 1985 performance at LiveAid, just years before Mercury lost his life to complications from HIV/AIDS, “Bohemian Rhapsody” follows the lives of the band and of Mercury concurrently. It tells the story of a band and a performer who changed rock music forever, and it has fun while doing so. In staying true to its subjects and emphasizing their unmatched theatricality, “Bohemian Rhapsody” gives a survey of Queen that strikes the perfect balance between nuance and entertainment.
The movie does not begin with “Freddie Mercury” as he is ubiquitously known today, but rather with Farrokh Bulsara, raised by Parsi parents in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The young adult, portrayed beautifully by Rami Malek, leaves home late at night for a rock concert insisting to be called “Freddie” instead of Farrokh, much to the chagrin of his parents. While the energy of the scene is light, and the dialogue slightly comedic, the movie persists in taking seriously Mercury’s tense and evolving relationship with both his identity and family. In a particularly striking moment, at a birthday dinner with his family and Queen bandmates Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), Mercury starts playing the piano and singing to distract his parents from telling his friends their family’s origin story at the table and reveals he has changed his surname to “Mercury.” While the scene provoked laughs, it was also a very real example of the ways Freddie Mercury often constructed his public image to shroud his cultural identity.
In 2018, it’s hard to imagine a time when anthems like “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “We Will Rock You,” and “Another One Bites the Dust” do not already exist, and so the novelty of watching the band’s uncertainty when producing these songs is all the more entertaining. When Mercury first plays the opening melody of “Bohemian Rhapsody” for his girlfriend and companion Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton), she praises it and he replies, “I think it has potential.” In lieu of trying to cram in as many songs, tours, and recording sessions as it can, the movie touches on different points in Queen’s timeline. While it is often unable to dive deep into the band’s career, given its limited time, it tackles each moment it does display with a theatricality and performative flair that Mercury himself would have admired. At first thought, a concert montage framed by electric graphics practically popping off the scene might be considered grandiose, but for Mercury there was no such thing.
The greatest challenge for the actors of the film, specifically for Malek, is doing justice to musical icons who are larger-than-life in every possible sense and meaning to the phrase. From Mercury’s struggles with his cultural identity to his fluid sexuality to his terminal illness, Malek plays the character with heart and with an admirable embodiment of his characteristic and undying dramatic flair. A film portrayal of Mercury, however, feels almost natural, as he was a man who was almost constantly performing. From his elaborate costumes to his attitude and speech habits (many of his sentences ending in an infectious drawl of “dear” or “darling”), Mercury wasn’t anywhere close to subtle and Malek’s energy and commitment is the exact kind that the role requires. He truly disappears into his character.
Rather than distracting itself by trying to report each and every detail of the band’s history, the movie surveys the stories of the humans who formed Queen, their unique style, and the cultural frenzy that follows them to this day. “Bohemian Rhapsody,” much like Freddie Mercury, has to make choices about what facets of itself to put on display at any given moment, but always does so in style.

Performance artist Diana Oh is currently in a season-long residency at the American Repertory Theater premiering a multi-part work titled “Clairvoyance.” She/They wrote and starred in “{my lingerie play},” a series of performances in New York in 2017. The Harvard Crimson had a chance to interview her/them about her/their current projects and residency.
The Harvard Crimson: Looking back at your past, was there a specific moment where you knew you wanted to become an artist? Or was it a gradual process where you realized you had a voice and wanted to contribute?
Diana Oh: When I was born. There are these tattoos on my fingers: Oh, Yea, Bin. Oh is my last name. Yea Bin means artistic light in Korean. My dad is a clairvoyant, so he knew what his kids were going to be, how old we were going to be, and what our destinies were gonna be.
THC: You attended Smith College, a couple hours west of Cambridge. How did you grow as a person and performer there?
DO: I grew into my queerness there. It was a really courageous space where walking around wearing nothing was not a big deal. It was truly an utopia for anybody that isn’t a cisgendered man. So that was really refreshing, and I’m really thankful for that because it taught me that I want to create spaces that rise to that same level of humanity. It was a rude awakening a couple of years out of school where it was like, “Right, OK, I’m gonna be slut-shamed for the rest of my life unless I create spaces that understand.”
One of the first things at Smith was this convocation. We re-enact it in “{my lingerie play}.” The night before classes start, all the students dress up in underwear. The whole point is you don’t dress up. You dress down. And that’s the first event before classes start. Your teachers are there and the faculty’s there and you have all the students wearing aprons and nothing else. You have students dressed up in tin foil because that was the house name. Getting to scream in your body that way, never having to worry once about what was going to happen to you — that’s incredible.
THC: With your installation being called “Clairvoyance,” what do you hope to get people to see during your residency?
DO: Their hearts. I think that’s a big one. Compassion. I think living a more present, heart-centered life is only going to help everybody. I think learning that we’re not machines, that we are meant to look people in the eye and feel feelings. I think also that teaching about our gut and what it means to trust our gut and what it means to actually feel something in our bodies when something is right or wrong and getting a voice there. And how certain people feel permission to do that and certain people don’t. I think that “Clairvoyance” is about knowing something that maybe your brain can’t wrap around, but your body can. And I feel like I have a lot of experience with following my body before my brain.
THC: Your first installation focused on choosing your family. Was there something empowering about that topic that made you choose it for your first installation?
DO: Chosen family is a word that’s thrown around in a lot of queer and trans communities. I’ve heard a lot of stories and have had a lot of friends open up about being rejected by their family they were born int, and needing to move into a different city to find the people who would really accept them for who they were. Thankfully, I haven’t had that. I didn’t get kicked out, but there was a kind of confusion around my identity. A lot of that is intergenerational trauma. I was born to two Korean immigrants who came here in the 1980s, and they didn’t have an understanding. They didn’t even know.
THC: “{my lingerie play}” has received a lot of audience interaction. Do you think that’s important for authenticity, and do you think more theater should be interactive?
DO: To each their own! For me, it’s about making art that’s true to you. For “{my lingerie play},” so much of it was created on the spot and in the moment, spontaneously, and it was from the gut. That’s a way I personally like to create and that’s why this year really works for me because it’s like being on the ground.
THC: Your next installation is titled “White People Read.” What do you hope to get out of it?
DO: “White People Read” is an installation that I hope provides a bridge. The way I described it to my friend Sophie was that we have to look at this as more art, less YMCA. There’s something about asking what made individuals come in and read books that are from a personal reading list that’s come from my heart. It’s sourced from this place: “What are the books that really resonate with me, that make me feel seen, that make me accountable to those I love, that make me want to show up as a civilian in the world right now?” Being able to make that list and say, OK, the people who I really want to read these books are white people, particularly white people in power. I think there’s this lack of understanding, or there’s a lot of blind spots. I’m often brought in to teach, or brought in to ask groups a lot of questions, or I’m brought in and told things that are racist or sexist or genderist. Wouldn’t it be amazing if people took on the learning of people of marginalized experiences for themselves, rather than let us teach you? I believe in call-in culture, not call-out culture.
THC: Finally, do you think art’s role is changing? And, if yes, is that change for the better?
DO: I think it’s getting really fierce and unapologetic in a way that’s really refreshing. I feel like people have stopped pressing the snooze button. It’s this immediacy and hunger and this Renaissance. I was telling Mark, the producer here, that we are in the middle of a Renaissance right now, and I really believe that structures are changing behind the table where people are having this awareness. Acting managers and agents can’t yell at their clients anymore. Even that simple gesture then changes the projects that people say “yes” and “no” to. It changes whether you can speak up.

Some of the most transcendent moments of the last decade in music resulted from high-profile hip-hop collaborations: Nicki Minaj’s verse on Kanye West’s “Monster,” George Clinton and Thundercat’s contributions to Kendrick Lamar’s “Wesley’s Theory,” and the endless rotating cast of features on Travis Scott’s “Astroworld.” These appearances sometimes seemed to give the guest artists even greater focus than in their own work, and they responded with ambition and excellence.
But none match the collaborative spectacular of the Traveling Wilburys for sheer delight. The project emerged from the B-side jam sessions of George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne, which they enjoyed enough to record a full pseudonymous album, “Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1,” which they released 30 years ago earlier this month.
Like George Clinton’s somewhat anachronistic but welcome presence on Lamar’s track, the Wilburys have an intergenerational charm. Orbison, the oldest, was one of the earliest stars of rock and roll as a codified genre. He and Dylan clearly had a strong influence on the Beatles (of which Harrison was, of course, a member). And although any description as “Beatlesque” is necessarily fraught, Lynne (of Electric Light Orchestra) and Petty bear the Fab Four’s influence about as strongly as any artist since. Perhaps because of this dynamic — the elders relaxing among their fans-cum-bandmates, the youngsters on the top of their game to impress their idols — “Vol. 1” somehow manages to be more than the sum of its stars’ earth-moving talents.
As Harrison might have recalled from his alter ego project 21 years earlier, the mask of a fake band encouraged creativity and humor. How else could Dylan, during a streak of commercially unsuccessful and critically panned mid-’80s albums, have written “Dirty World,” whose very funny couplets belie its narrator’s melange of jealousy, hurt, lust, and misogynistic contempt, or the even funnier Springsteen parody “Tweeter and the Monkey Man”? Petty’s “Last Night” and “Margarita” likewise contribute a down-on-their-luck ethos to the myth of the traveling brothers. Harrison’s songs “Handle with Care,” “Heading for the Light,” and “End of the Line” don’t fit quite as well in the concept, but they’re the best and catchiest tracks on the album, radiating the joy of a man back in a band for the first time in 17 years. Three decades after its release, the record demands a listen less for the novelty of all of its star power on the same tracks — especially after so many tribute concerts and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame reunions — than for the chance to see these figures in this particular mood: chummy, irreverent, relaxed.
Although some members (Dylan and Harrison) take up much more space than others (Orbison), the super-supergroup shares the spotlight enough that their subtly different styles give the best songs a dynamic multi-part structure. “Handle with Care” starts with Harrison’s looping guitar riff and in-the-clouds vocals on the verse, switches to a romantic pop melody for Orbison’s chorus, and turns up the cowbell for Petty and Dylan’s gravelly country-rock verse, all united by Lynne’s gleaming (if dated) production.
On “End of the Line,” an anthem to optimism and individualism, the singers simply trade off the melody, a unity among the aging rockers that gives a special resonance to lines like “Well it’s all right, / Even if you’re old and gray / Well it’s all right, / You still got something to say.” That line serves as a sort of motto for the band: They all did have things to say. It just took each other to bring it out.

In 1968, rock music was at its peak popularity. The Beatles were on a creative high, following a busy 1967 during which they released “Magical Mystery Tour” and “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” in their longest album, “The White Album.” The Rolling Stones would release some of their best-known songs, including “Sympathy for the Devil,” in 1968, and Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham formed Led Zeppelin at the end of the year. No instrument characterized the rock movement of the 1960s more than the guitar did, and while all three of those groups and others made prominent use of the guitar, no musician is, even in the present day, as closely linked to the electric guitar as Jimi Hendrix is. 50 years ago, Hendrix, with the rest of the Jimi Hendrix Experience (bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell), released his only chart-topping album, “Electric Ladyland,” an hour and 15 minute-long work that presented a definition of rock music that in equal parts drew upon rock’s young history and dove into new, experimental realms.
Unlike many other albums of its time, “Electric Ladyland” often tries to establish its meaning through instrumentals, instead of leaning solely on the lyrics to do so. The album begins in disarray with “And the Gods Made Love,” a track that consists of an assortment of non-musical noises under pitched-down speech. Hendrix himself said in an interview that, “We knew this was the track that most people will jump on to criticize, so I put it first to get it over with.” Jokes aside, the opener establishes a sense of paranoia and anxiety in the album, a theme that Hendrix revisits. Similarly, “Crosstown Traffic,” the third track of the album, uses the synchronization of Hendrix’s guitar licks with drummer Mitch Mitchell’s quick fills to embody a woman that Hendrix is enamored with.
This is not to say that “Electric Ladyland” does not have several moments of lyrical depth. In the album’s second track, “Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland),” Hendrix plays off of the album’s pre-established paranoia with a song that seems an alternative to the disorder present in its predecessor. The lyrics (“I want to show you”) offer a journey reminiscent of The Beatles’ “Magical Mystery Tour,” but while the “Magical Mystery Tour” took listeners on a psychedelic trip, “Electric Ladyland” is an escape from the messiness of the current time. “Voodoo Chile” picks up where “Crosstown Traffic” left off in terms of displaying the tight connection between Hendrix’s and Mitchell’s instrumentation. Yet through its psychedelic, almost magical lyrics, the song reverts to the idea of “Electric Ladyland” representing an escape to its listeners. Later on the album, “1983…(A Merman I Should Turn to Be)” uses similar magical imagery.
Still, “Electric Ladyland” does not contain a broad lyrical theme that pervades in every track on the album. Moreover, while some of the songs contain anti-Vietnam war messages (“It’s really such a mess… / Every inch of earth is a fighting nest,” he sings in “1983…(A Merman I Should Turn to Be)”), many others don’t contain a clear message. One could interpret the lack of lyrical gravity as detrimental to the album. Granted, it is the album’s main fault, but Hendrix’s delivery of these lines also allows for one of the album’s biggest strengths: its use of the voice as a musical instrument.
In several songs on “Electric Ladyland,” including “Gypsy Eyes” and “Burning of the Midnight Lamp,” the music production finds Hendrix’s vocals layered with or beneath other instruments. In “Gypsy Eyes” specifically, the vocal melody’s imitation of the guitar melody in the hook drives home the notion that, on this album, the voice isn’t the central focus. This is an especially novel idea in contemporary popular music, in which the voice garners most of the focus in songs. In “Electric Ladyland,” the lack of emphasis on the voice gives Hendrix’s guitar the opportunity to shine, and does so impressively. Nearly every song on “Ladyland” has a guitar solo in which Hendrix demonstrates his own virtuosity. Beyond Hendrix’s technical capability, the guitar plays a particularly interesting role in the album when it “sings.” On the aforementioned “Crosstown Traffic,” Hendrix pairs his guitar with a kazoo in order to create the effect of the guitar having a voice-like quality. On multiple other songs, Hendrix similarly uses effects to give his guitar vocal qualities. This element of the instrumentation characterizes the album and the experimentalism of its project: On “Electric Ladyland,” the guitar plays the role that the voice typically does in popular music.
Although its lyrics may lack in depth at times, through its experimentation in reimagining the roles of the voice and the guitar, “Electric Ladyland” is an artistic feat of great magnitude. That excludes the album’s most famous and strongest track, Hendrix’s cover of the Bob Dylan-penned “All Along the Watchtower.” The song implements the technical virtuosity and experimental instrumentation that shines in the rest of the album with clever lyrics displayed through Hendrix’s conversational singing. The track, while not written by Hendrix, exemplifies the strengths of “Electric Ladyland.”

As the Harvard men’s basketball team prepares to open its 11th season under Coach Tommy Amaker, a few Crimson alums are making waves in the pros.
Wesley Saunders, Brandyn Curry, and Siyani Chambers, all of whom played under Amaker during Harvard’s 2014 March Madness run into the third round, are working towards replicating their success overseas.
After four years at Cambridge capped by an Ivy League Player of the Year Award as a senior in 2014, Wesley Saunders spent three seasons in the NBA D-League with affiliates of the New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls. This past summer, the 6’6” shooting guard made his way to Italy, signing with Vanoli Cremona. Saunders has immediately become a star for the Italian side, leading the team in minutes (33.3) and steals per game (2.0) while also averaging 16.7 points and 6.3 assists per game.
Saunders’ teammate Brandyn Curry found immediate success upon graduation, signing with SPM Shoeters Den Bosch of the Dutch Basketball League in August of 2014. The 6’1” point guard led his team to a championship in his first season, being named the DBL Playoffs MVP. After making stops in Slovenia and Germany, Curry returned to the DBL with Donar Gronigen, securing the DBL Playoffs MVP once again and also winning the regular season MVP.
Former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Siyani Chambers, remembered at Harvard for helping the Crimson upset New Mexico in the second round of the NCAA tournament in his freshman year, has found a new home with the Gießen 46ers in Germany’s premier basketball league Basketball Bundesliga after spending last season in Austria with the Raiffeisen Flyers Wels. The former Crimson captain averaged 14.9 points, 5.3 assists, and 1.6 steals per game in his first professional season in Austria, earning an all-star appearance in the Austrian Bundesliga A.
Harvard Basketball, ranked first in the Ivy League preseason poll, has plenty to look forward to this season both for itself and for its alums, many of whom are thriving overseas.

The No. 6 Harvard field hockey team added to its ledger of achievements on Saturday, notching a 6-0 win over Dartmouth to earn at least a share of the 2018 Ivy League title. Extending a program-record win streak to 12, the Crimson also clinched a berth in the NCAA tournament. The postseason appearance will be the program’s second in the last three years and sixth all-time.
“It feels amazing,” sophomore midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen said. “We have such a strong team and even under these conditions — away game, bad weather, and the pressure of being to secure the share of a championship — we can execute our plans.”
Harvard (15-1, 6-0 Ivy) dominated the entire game despite the frigid, rainy conditions, putting 21 shots on goal. The Big Green (6-9, 2-4) managed only one, which was handled easily by freshman goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo. Shahbo has now won her last nine starts and conceded only three goals in that stretch.
“My defense makes it very easy for me,” Shahbo said with a laugh. “I don’t actually have to do that much. I was just sitting around getting cold today.”
Junior midfielder Casey Allen opened the scoring at 22:15 with a quick finish at the end of a penalty corner sequence, and junior forward Maddie Earle followed with a goal of her own a few minutes later.
The Crimson entered the locker room at half nursing a 2-0 lead and looking for insurance. It got it from Allen, who found the net again at 39:49 to put Harvard up 3-0 and later tallied an assist to finish with a career-high five points.
Senior back Olivia Allin whipped a shot into the top shelf shortly after, and Earle then scored again to put the game essentially out of reach. Earle’s pair pushed her season total to 14 goals, and she now sits atop the Ivy League leaderboard in the category.
Junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen put the cherry on top of the win with a turnaround flick into the cage at 66:41. The Dutch native was on the prowl all afternoon, pacing the team with eight shots, all on goal.
“One of our big mottoes this year is ‘next five minutes’ and just stay focused,” van Vlijmen said. “We were all super happy.”
Clearly, she took that message to heart on Saturday, when neither sleet nor the efforts of Big Green senior goalkeeper Hailey Valerio could prevent her from eventually breaking through for a goal.
For the team’s leadership, the moment was even more special. The program won a banner in 2016, but after a disappointing 2017 season, the seniors are thrilled to be back on top.
“The growth over the past four years has been fantastic, and it has been an honor to be a part of it with my senior classmates,” co-captain Kathleen Young said. “This season we’ve seen success because our goals have been process-based. Our team goal is to improve every game and . . . see what the outcome is at the end of the game.”
Head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden was proud of his squad.
“We knew what [this game] was going to be, and we mentally prepared for it,” van Herwaarden said. “This team is on a mission. We did a good job of being able to control the controllables.”
As excited as they are, the players acknowledge that their work is not done yet. The Crimson will honor its seniors as it takes on Columbia on Nov. 3 on its home turf, where it is undefeated this season. Harvard spoiled Dartmouth’s senior game, and it will try to ensure that the Lions can’t return the favor. With a win, the Crimson will gain sole possession of the Ivy League throne, and the whole program is hungry.
“We didn’t celebrate too much today,” van Herwaarden said. “We want to win outright on our home field. We don’t want to share this title with anyone.”

Harvard women’s rugby has lost to Dartmouth in every contest the past four seasons. Saturday afternoon, it reversed the script and pulled off the upset victory in a low-scoring 12-3 contest.
This win earned the Crimson (6-1) its second-ever Ivy crown as it clinched the one seed going into the NIRA Playoffs.
"We didn't idolize Dartmouth too much," senior Akweley Okine said. "They are...worth respecting but definitely not one that is unbeatable. That was a lot of the mindset and with it being the Ivy League Championship, I think people were pretty sentimental going into it."
The Big Green(6-1) previously dominated Harvard on Sept. 22, blowing past the Crimson 55-13. But in the soggy fields and torrential rain in Hanover, N.H., Saturday afternoon, critical defensive performances from the team and opportune scoring made the difference.
"We had 3 major goals that we wanted to keep in mind throughout the game," junior Delia Hellander said. "One was to execute our blitz defense...second was to have continuity on offense, just keeping the ball alive and protecting the ball. And our third one was keeping a positive mental attitude and composure throughout the game when things didn’t go our way. I think that was what kept us in the running and what resulted in us winning the game."
Okine scored her first try of the season at the start of the second half, adding onto classmate Caitlin Weigel’s try in the first frame. Dartmouth’s only points of the game came from a kick at the start of the contest.
"Today it was just putting [it] all together," Okine added. "It was really cool to see like all the hard work we put in place like in practices and different games finally all come together."
The first round of the NIRA Quarterfinals commences on Saturday, November 10th, with the Championships slated for the following weekend.

If you don’t think you have destroyed your immune system enough during this year’s two-weekend Halloweekend, here are a few ways you can celebrate Halloween on the actual day.
CEB Trick or Treat: Nightmare on Harvard Street (Hey, that rhymes!)
Dying to spend more time with your proctor? Reminiscing about childhood Halloweens long passed? Come to CEB’s trick or treating event from 6-8 p.m. in the Old Yard. Proctors will be in costume (yes, you heard that right) outside freshman dorms giving out candy to disgruntled students and probably a handful of scheming tourists. There’s also a costume contest, so dress to impress. A little confused where the “Nightmare” part of this night comes into play? We are too, but we’re pretty sure it will be from the look on your proctor’s face as you parade around in your “sexy Drew Faust” costume.
A Boujee Adult Event in Boston
If you truly must rage on Halloween, and you’re *so* over dorm parties and Rubinoff, head out for a real adult night on the town. If Utopia didn’t ruin your love of boat parties forever, the three-hour Black Pearl Cruise is the perfect chance to take in the Boston skyline and dance the night away aboard a “haunted” vessel. A Trick-or-Treat Halloween Costume Ball at Garage Boston also promises Halloween games, “special celebrity guest judges” for costume contests, and cash prizes. If you’re going to embarrass yourself, why not do it with a group of drunk strangers?
A Snacks and Scary Movie Night
Grab a group of friends and pop in “Silence of the Lambs” or “Friday the 13th” for a scary movie marathon (points if you can leave the lights off!), or opt for classics such as “Halloweentown” and “Hocus Pocus.” You can pretend to bake something, but actually just heat up those drugstore frosted sugar cookies that we’re pretty sure are cancerous. Want a real scare? Try checking the ingredient list — there’s some horror for you.
Actually Party on a Wednesday
A little depressing? Maybe. But a hump-day Halloween party doesn’t have to be all that blah. Flex your creative muscles and round up a fifth costume. It gives your on-campus crush yet another chance to spot you in sexy attire and immediately fall in love. Who cares that you’re wearing mesh tights and a leotard in Jefe’s? You may just start a new trend. Wednesdays are the new Saturdays.
Now that midterm season is over and you’ve emerged from the cavernous depths of the library, consider actually doing something on Halloween. At least you won’t be the only one stumbling hungover to your Thursday 9 a.m.

These days, Harvard students have nothing to do but complain about midterm season. Starting today though, Harvard’s eighth annual Sex Week gives students a different reason to moan. Want the low-down on getting down and dirty? Lucky for you, Flyby has the inside scoop on everything you need to know about Sex Week.
A Quick(ie) Overview
Sex Week is exactly what it sounds like: a week of sex and relationship-related events and seminars. Run by SHEATH, Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, Sex Week hosts about two events per day, covering topics from fetishes to period sex and everything in between.
Let’s Talk About Sexy, Baby
Whether you’re among the 60.8% of Harvard students who entered the College this year as virgins or are a bona fide sexpert, taking the time for some (s)extra education is never a bad idea. Sex Week’s seminars aren’t your parents’ sex ed (though your parents may attend). Gone are the days of watching your health teacher roll a condom onto a banana. From the essential to the taboo, Sex Week has every question you may have covered — and by experts, too! Seminars are instructed by PhD-holders, educators from Harvard Square’s favorite sex shop, Good Vibrations, and student panelists from organizations like the Harvard Foundation, QuOffice, and SHARC (Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication). “We’re very close to Good Vibrations,” says Lita Peña ‘19, a fourth-year member and co-president of SHEATH, “and all of their store members are trained as sexual health educators.”
Looking for a hands-on experience or just want to spice up your Gcal with an event containing the word “orgasm” in the title? Drop by Sever 102 from 4 to 5:30 p.m. TODAY(!) for Sex Week’s kickoff event, “Say Yes to Safer Sex: Protection Methods 101.” Here you’ll get information on condoms, birth control, and all those preventative measures you’re less familiar with (there’s a birth control that goes in your arm?!).
Seven Sexy (Not Sinful!) Events
One can’t-miss event is tomorrow night, from 8-9:30 p.m. with Sex Week’s keynote speaker, Dr. Laurie Mintz, who will be speaking a pertinent subject from her best-selling book, "Becoming Cliterate: Why Orgasm Equality Matters and How to Get It." People with clitorises, and their partners, are encouraged to attend, but — as with all Sex Week events — all identities are welcome.
But Sex Week offers more than just your standard information sessions, offering interactive events and thought-provoking lectures and discussions. For a topic that goes beyond the bedroom, swing through Emerson 305 to catch “Swipe Right: Racial Preferences and Dating” this coming Tuesday from 8 to 9 p.m.
For the adventurous types, clear a space in your calendar this Halloween for “Hit Me Baby One More Time: BDSM in the Dorm Room,” in Sever 113 from 8 to 9:30 p.m. to explore how a world of whips and chains can coexist with living across the hall from your proctor. If you’re among the faction of college students whose motivation to attend free events is directly proportional to the amount of free swag available, Sex Week is definitely for you, with free safe sex supplies at all events this week. Don’t just raid the freebies and leave, though, because according to Peña, they raffle out free sex toys at the end of every event.
Get really interactive with events like “Feel Those Good Vibrations: Sex Toys 101,” (which conveniently overlaps with the first day of Parent’s Weekend, if you’re looking for a less traditional family bonding activity). This is the second-to-last event of Sex Week, which ends next Sunday, November 4th. Your learned parents might prefer “Sexpardy” that day — which is no, not a sex party, but a Jeopardy-style trivia event where you can test all you’ve learned throughout the week for ~fun~ prizes.
Whether you’re in it for the freebies or if you’re truly looking for a ~transformative learning experience~ (or even if you’re just there to spot your dhall crush in the Dirty Talk seminar), you can’t go wrong with attending these Sex Week events, so be sure to come as much as possible ;-).
