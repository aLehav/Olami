After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Yannatos raised the baton for his first concert as Music Director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, the oldest symphony orchestra in the nation, in 1964. And after conducting for 45 years, leading 11 international tours, and guiding thousands of young musicians, “Dr. Y”—as he is affectionately known—stepped up to the Sanders Theatre podium for the last time on Friday night, conducting a moving concert that was at once a commemoration, a celebration, a look back, and a look forward.The program reflected the sentiments of the evening, as the three pieces exuded exuberance, creativity, and triumph, respectively. The first piece—the overture to Mozart’s famous final opera “The Magic Flute”—was a bubbling introduction to a concert that would end with an epic performance of Brahms’ first symphony. The piece was marked by a controlled excitement, as the orchestra was focused and almost on edge, clearly aware of the night’s significance. Balance was a particular strength, as the playful, lilting flute and oboe floated easily on the propulsive strings.Next was Dr. Yannatos’ own cello concerto, composed in 2004. The performance—the piece’s first since a catastrophic premiere two years ago—featured internationally renowned soloist Bong-Ihn Koh ’08. Koh gave a thoughtful delivery from the first notes, eking out tremendous expression from the piece’s idiosyncratic language. Yearning and singing through the cello, he swayed at times into a consonant orchestral sound before erupting out of it. He displayed a mastery of the virtuosic music, especially in a brief cadenza near the end of the movement.The second movement, an Andante, seemed like it was always reaching for something, and as in the first, Koh shifted elegantly from introversion to extroversion. Impelled by a pizzicato theme in the cello at the beginning, the third movement continued Yannatos’ unusual tonality. The orchestra had a kind of bulging tension just below the solo cello, and the piece ended with a radiant flourish in the cello’s highest register.After intermission, HRO President Eugene W. Lee ’10 and Office for the Arts Director Jack Megan spoke to the audience about Dr. Yannatos’ distinguished career and enormous impact on generations of Harvard undergraduates. Lee noted Yannatos’ “familial, loving relationship with his students,” and Megan presented an honorary certificate from the University Marshal after showing a slideshow of images of Yannatos with the HRO through the decades of his tenure. The certificate declared that “Harvard has deepest and lasting gratitude” for Yannatos, who “enhanced the cultural life of Harvard University” while “enriching the lives of thousands” with his music knowledge, artistry, and passion.After receiving the award, Yannatos thanked his students with tears in his eyes. Instead of customarily saying goodbye to the seniors, that night he had to say goodbye to the entire orchestra: “I cherish each of you. I love you all. I wish you all a full life, a rich life, a meaningful life. Keep the treasure that you have which is music.”He then left the stage and returned to conduct his final piece as Music Director: Brahms’ monumental Symphony No. 1. Like Yannatos’ tenure with the HRO, Brahms’ composition of his first symphony was an effort that spanned many years; after sketching out his first ideas, he allowed over two decades to elapse before deeming it fit to premiere in 1874. The HRO’s performance of the classic was one of their most profound and polished in recent memory. The violins forcefully sustained the opening line, topping the coherent string section. The decay and buildup to the recapitulation of the main theme was smooth and dramatic, finishing with overwhelming power.Yannatos controlled the second movement’s thick orchestration delicately, using it to always support a clear, prominent melodic line. Julia L. Glenn ’11 finished the movement with a soaring violin solo. After the light third movement, the fourth movement was a gathering storm that led to a supreme finale. The orchestra’s sound in the famous theme in the middle of the movement was as beautiful as the HRO has achieved this season.The “great Yannatos era,” as Lee put it in his remarks, is over, but Harvard and HRO alumni will feel Yannatos’ impact for decades to come. While writing his first symphony, Brahms said, “You can’t have any idea what it’s like always to hear such a giant marching behind you,” alluding to Beethoven’s towering reputation as a symphonic composer. HRO’s next conductor, to take the podium next fall, must feel a similar shadow in following such a titan as Yannatos.

Nearly a century ago in Paris, the world premiere of Stravinsky’s ballet “The Rite of Spring” with the Ballet Russes was met with such an intense riot that the performance had to be stopped in an attempt to quell the uproar. The extreme chaos and newness inherent to the music and the accompanying dance incited the outrage of the conservative audience. However, decades later, the brilliance of Stravinsky and the choreographer of the Ballet Russes, Sergei Diaghilev, revealed itself, drastically changing the course of ballet and classical music.On Saturday night, the Harvard Dance Program performed a collection a dances honoring the centennial of the Ballet Russes in “Viewpointe 9: Rite of Passage.” The pieces, all inspired by the works associated with the Ballet Russes era, were expertly executed and enjoyable to watch. However, what the performance lacked was the true essence of the Ballet Russes—a sense of innovation and originality that pushes the limits of what ballet can be and inspires new understanding of artistic creation.The four vastly different dances were choreographed by various professionals and undergraduate students and centered on an eclectic array of wonderfully conceived music. Overall, the musical choices were exceptional, and the artists deserve enormous credit for their dedication to the demanding and sometimes arrhythmic choreography.  The first piece, choreographed by Elizabeth Weil Bergmann and composed by Jody Diamond, featured the distinctly Indonesian sound of the gamelan. The piece began with the eerie resonance of the gamelan instruments vacillating between two notes. The Indonesian-inspired dance was divided into an opening and four subsequent parts strikingly offset by the change in colors of the background. The combination of the skillfully composed gamelan music and visually appealing dancing influenced by South Asian traditions coalesced beautifully together. Some of the dancing, however, seemed to lack the effortless flow and clear-cut motion that is required of such a piece. The much-anticipated United States premiere of “The Rite of Spring” choreographed by Jaime Blanc, one of the most highly regarded dancers in Mexico, was by no stretch of the imagination the supposed highlight of the evening’s performance. The dance was performed to the original music of Stravinsky and revolved around the same themes of pagan rituals and rebirth that inspired the original. Because of the unusual rhythms and dissonance of the piece, the tribal motions of the dancers were quite stunning. As a whole, the performers executed the half-hour long piece with the upmost precision and professionalism, never faltering for a second in their amount of energy and the care given to each move. In particular, the performance by Kristin E.I. Aune ’03—the “chosen” character—was truly remarkable. Using her body with the upmost precision, she successfully conveyed the essence of her part. While the technique of the dancers was exquisite, a fresher and bolder adaptation of the original ballet would have better served as celebration of the Ballet Russes. Although the choreography did at times add its own creative flair—with the passionate scenes depicting two ancestors fighting over the fate of the “chosen one” or the possessed movements of the pagan tribe as they come in contact with powerful ancestors—it seemed to rely heavily on the movements and themes of the original “Rite of Spring” performance. The artistic vision and purpose of Blanc’s arrangement was effectively portrayed but simply lacked the daring of the original ballet. The second piece of the performance, entitled “Anomie,” was the hidden gem of the entire performance. The music was a piano piece written by César Franck and featured some professionally trained dancers and other undergraduates. The piece, choreographed by Claudia F. Schreier ’08, focused on various leg movements and lifts by performers Puanani H. Brown ’12, James C. Fuller ’10, Amanda C. Lynch ’10, Kevin Shee ’11, and Elizabeth C. Walker ’11. The interplay between the bodies of the two male dancers and three female dancers throughout the performance created an overall elegance and grace comparable to that of any professional company.When Diaghilev was asked about the ensuing riot some 90 years ago, he allegedly stated that it was just what he wanted. On Saturday night, the Harvard Dance Program attempted to put on a show centered on the “spirit of the Ballet Russes,” a spirit Diaghilev’s words truly encompass. The show was skillfully performed and the combination of traditional ballet movements with modern interpretations set to such brilliantly scored music made the evening very entertaining. Perhaps a more interesting way of paying tribute to the influence of the Ballet Russes, though, would have been to apply the words of Diaghilev, to put on a show purposefully designed to stretch the mental constructs of ballet and dance.

This Saturday, the Harvard Classical Club translated Aristophanes’s classical Athenian “Lysistrata”—the story of a band of woman determined to end the Peloponnesian War by withholding sex from their “menfolk”—into a modern discussion of sex and gender roles. In this case, “translate” was a loose term; the disgruntled Grecian housewives drive minivans with baby-on-board stickers and complain about husbands who don’t listen to their advice.The Harvard Classical Club did more than add verbal allusions to the modern housewife’s strait; the liberties they took with the original text extended to sequined dresses and the incorporation of life-like dildos. Although “Lysistrata” sometimes bordered on absurdity, the humor created an original adaptation that highlighted the timeless feminist undertones of a classical play.Modernizing old classics to make them relatable again is a perilous venture, sometimes rewarding—like in the Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger film “Ten Things I Hate About You”—but often disastrous, such as in the Shakespeare-inspired Amanda Bynes flick “She’s the Man.”Although director James M. Leaf ’11 took great pains to keep the dialogue current, the set and costumes were wildly anachronistic, making it all the more clear that the gender issues Aristophanes explored in 411 B.C. persist through multiple millennia. The Loeb Experimental Theatre was transformed into a gritty, graffiti-laden dungeon, and the women wore costumes applicable to a number of female archetypes—the blouse and pearls of a housewife, the pink sundress of a Southern belle, the sequined mini-dress of a hooker.Lysistrata (Olivia J. Jampol ’09), stomping around in a black mini-skirt, black boots, and a leopard-print jacket, was convincing as a galvanizing force and militant feminist. After the male politicians and military officers ignore her initial pleas for peace between Athens and Sparta, she persuades the Athenian women to lock themselves up in Acropolis. But first, the lights dimmed as the men and women engaged in ninja-style combat. Points go to Ismenia (Vanessa B. Koo ’12) for enthusiastically engaging in the choreography as a housewife with an undercurrent of almost rabid aggression—even while wearing a pleated mini skirt. After a couple weeks of the sexual siege, the Athenian men, frustrated and tired of walking around with an erection—illustrated by very realistic dildos—agree to meet with the Spartans to make peace. The Spartans have been having similar issues; “Just as we’re about to get our freak on,” a herald (Aseem A. Shukla ’11) complains, “they talk about our military-industrial complexes.” Finally the Grecian men concede defeat and settle on a hasty treatise. “Lysistrata” managed to stay loyal to the classical Grecian comedy’s plot while integrating modern allusions. The sequin-clad women use a metaphor for spinning wool to illustrate the necessity of negotiations and peacekeeping and also consult the Oracle of Delphi. But while maintaining that spirit of conscientious pacifism, “Lysistrata” snidely pokes fun at modern gender stereotypes. “Did your wife redo the den into a living room and paint it eggshell?” one Athenian gripes to another. “And what the fuck is a chocolate fountain?”While HRDC’s “Lysistrata” often succumbs to the slapstick humor, sexual obscenities, and explicit double-entendres that are inevitable in a battle-of-the-sexes plot, it manages to offer a humorous but sincere discourse on modern feminism.

The Founding Fathers would have been in for a shock had they seen Boston Common on April 15. Over 500 protesters wielding teabags and standards decrying taxes, spending, socialism, and fascism congregated in one of the more than 750 “tea parties” the nation witnessed that day. National estimates for the number of participants range in the hundreds of thousands.
Tea-party enthusiasts claim that the tea parties were supposedly a spontaneous, nonpartisan, grassroots movement fashioned after the Boston Tea Party of Dec. 16, 1773, when disgruntled colonists tossed tea into Boston Harbor to protest taxation without representation. The only problem is that the tea parties of Tax Day 2009 were neither spontaneous nor, in fact, very much related to the original tea party.
If you were watching the media’s coverage of the tea parties, chances are that you were watching Fox News, as not only was Fox the only network providing full-day coverage of the events, but it was also spending the weeks prior actively promoting and advertising the tea parties under the label “FNC Tax Day Tea Parties.” Of course, it is difficult to claim to be reporting rather than participating when such Fox celebrity anchors as Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Neil Cavuto were hosting events that day—Hannity’s rally in Atlanta being the largest recorded draw in the country with a 15,000-member crowd.
Hannity, Beck, and Cavuto were not the only high-profile participants at the tea parties; speakers included such partisan figures as former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner, Republican Louisiana Senator David Vitter, Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry, and former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey. FreedomWorks, a group founded by Armey, was one of the largest sponsors of the day’s events.
However, the greater existential question for these spontaneous tea parties than the legitimacy of their spontaneity is the legitimacy of their claim to the title “tea party,” for it is not entirely clear what the protesters were protesting. 
One candidate is taxes. Even if one were to ignore the fact that President Obama’s stimulus bill cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans in one of the largest tax cuts in American history, it is not apt to declare the current situation a throwback to the Hanoverians. Rather, what the protesters are experiencing might be called taxation “with” representation. However, to claim that one is not being represented because one does not approve of the actions of a government endorsed by the majority of the electorate is to protest democracy itself.
The other main candidate is spending. However, if the protesters were protesting Obama’s profligate spending, then what connection is there to the Boston Tea Party at all? Furthermore, according to Karl Rove, “If [the tea party movement] has a father it is CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who called for holding a tea party in Chicago on July 4.” Yet Santelli was condemning homeowner bailouts—neither direct taxes nor spending.
The protests’ muddled message diluted their efficacy and enhanced the perception that the movement was more a tantrum thrown by a disgruntled conservative base than a national uprising against federal excess. The confusion was further exacerbated by the ubiquity of hyperbole and innuendo.
As discordant as simultaneous accusations of communism and fascism are, both were featured in abundance with placards blaring “D.C.: District of Communism” and “Barack Hussein Obama: The New Face of Hitler.” In addition to denouncing the perceived threats of communism and fascism were warnings against one world government and Islamophobic innuendo reminiscent of the 2008 presidential election.
This breed of hysteria is in turn reminiscent of the “Bush is Hitler” excesses of the antiwar left that the right so decried when President Bush was in power. It further marginalizes an out-of-favor but legitimate political paradigm whose contributions to the political debate are necessary for the health of our public discourse. By engaging in such puerile antics, the tea partiers only perpetuate the perception of their intellectual bankruptcy.

To the Esteemed Harvard Crimson:
I am writing to express my deep indignation upon hearing that our prestigious university’s most sacred of structures, the Harvard Faculty Club, will soon be profaned. I fear that this hallowed hall—once the very epicenter of intellectual conversation and civilized debate—will now become the stomping grounds for this university’s lowest specimen of vermin: students.
I, accustomed to taking my 5 o’clock scotch in the company of other well-mannered gentlemen, blanch at the notion of hooligans loitering among us. They threaten our quietude, with their newfangled dungarees and brimmed caps turned askew, and not so much as a single article of tweed! They scream along to their wild rock-and-roll music—all fans of those British, mop-headed Insects, or Beetles, or whatnot—and exhibit all manner of inappropriate merriment. 
With all due respect, I spent 40 years interacting with these so-called students—an aspect of the university I have never understood. Now, in my golden years, I ask nothing more than to relax without the incessant chatter of young ’uns, brimming with energy for no explicable reason. They will arrive, seeking pleasure on a Saturday night, and might even take sherry to the point of wooziness: for shame! They will then slur their speech and stumble about in an unrefined manner. An utter disgrace to this university! These troublemakers remain out until all hours of the night (I have seen them frolicking about past the 9 o’clock hour), when all decent individuals have long since retired for the evening. They speak in vulgarities, spewing phrases like “gosh darn it” and “shucks,” not to mention their fixation on playing table tennis in the wee hours of the morning. Do they not realize that sportsmanship should take place only in daylight?
Allowing them to commingle with your heralded patrons threatens to upend the fundamental values upon which this University was built. When these ruffians invade, with their disc jockeys and general enthusiasm for life, our last bastion of civilized society will sadly cease to exist.
Kind Regards,

On any given night, the typical teenager can be found sitting at her desk agonizing over homework—while chatting away online, checking Facebook, and perhaps catching up on an episode of Gossip Girl. She can’t concentrate; her mind flutters here and there without staying too long on any particular thought. Technology like search engines helps her conduct research for her paper, but it also provides a wealth of potential distractions.
The past decade has launched us into a flourishing Information Age. Information is everywhere, from television to the Internet. At Harvard, it is common to see students walking alone, BlackBerries and iPhones in hand, seemingly oblivious to the world surrounding them. While easy access to information has clear positive effects, it has also removed us from the real world, making us excessively dependent on technology, unable to focus, and isolated from those around us.
The Internet has helped facilitate communication—but communication with whom? While we have been able to connect more easily with, say, Christina Aguilera or total strangers from the other side of the globe we meet on MySpace or in chat rooms, we have been separated from the people that matter. According to a Stanford study, those who use the Internet frequently—an estimated 31 percent of the U.S. population—spend an average of 70 minutes fewer per day interacting with family than those who use the Internet less frequently or not at all.
Many of us are so addicted to instant messaging or updating our Facebook albums that it can be hard to tear ourselves away from our precious technology long enough to spend time with real people. The enormous growth in membership in time-consuming online games such as World of Warcraft and Second Life is indicative of this problem—Second Life alone has 1.3 million users who log in per month. Many live in this virtual reality, paying real money for brand-name products or even marrying other characters within the game. 
Certainly, cyberspace provides an anonymity and freedom that is safe and exciting in a way that the real world can never be, letting us escape from our problems and live out the life we want. We choose our own reality online to replace real life. Is someone bothering you? In Second Life, you can mute them with the click of a button.
Unfortunately, this ability to change settings or switch channels whenever we want has a downside. Research has shown that exposure to repeated blips of information from video games and TV may rewire the brain to create shorter attention spans. Some researchers have even suggested that the rise in cases of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder may be connected to the growing screen culture. 
In response, advertisements, television shows, and even the news are placing more and more emphasis on keeping the viewer entertained with short clips rather than informing them with long ones. The 30-second television commercial is all but extinct; we simply cannot focus for that long anymore. How many of us have spent hours flipping through the television, unable to settle on just one channel? Reared on a diet of constant entertainment, it is no wonder that some of us fail to find instant gratification in life and turn even more toward the virtual world.
This withdrawal from reality, however, is extremely hazardous to our health. A growing body of research has revealed a strong correlation between excessive Internet use and mental disorders. Some neuroscientists, for instance, have suggested a possible link between the increase in online relationships and the rise in autism. Since online chatting does not require the sensitivity to tone and body language like a real conversation does, excessive reliance on online communication might cause our face-to-face communication skills to deteriorate. This leads to further social isolation as we retreat back into our online relationships.
Some of the “positive” effects of technology have, indeed, backfired on us. There is such a thing as being too connected with technology, too inundated with information, and too out of touch with the world around us. This leaves us no time for silent reflection and no peace unless we immerse ourselves in some exciting computer-generated fantasy. Perhaps it is time to unplug, disconnect, and go make our own more vivid adventures in reality.

Amid the current economic contraction, there is one thing in abundant supply: blame. Equally abundant is the desire to blame George W. Bush for the recession. Indeed, writers on these pages and others have used our shrinking economy as an excuse to indict President Obama’s predecessor on everything from poor health care to climate change to racism. 
There is no denying that previous administrations helped to create the conditions from which our current crisis stems, but a closer inspection suggests that Democrats deserve the most blame. Both the Bush and Clinton administrations (but especially Clinton’s) recklessly pushed to expand home ownership, fuelling the bubble in housing prices and its collapse. Former President Bush’s failure to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac permitted the crisis in subprime mortgages to build, though congressional Democrats bear the lion’s share of blame for their obstructionism: They opposed a Bush administration proposal for greater regulation, even though Fannie and Freddie’s own executives favored the change. The lack of broad oversight in financial markets led investors to rely too heavily on faulty investment ratings by firms like Moody’s.
Economists of all political stripes agree that the recession grew largely from certain issues: An unsustainable boom in home prices—propped up in part by daredevil lending—led to a rapid depreciation in home values. When transmitted through securitization, this loss of wealth resulted in a crisis of confidence in credit markets and a downturn in economic activity.
Noticeably absent from this explanation of the recession is any mention of Bush’s tax policy, health-care plans, climate-change proposals, education programs, or foreign policy. Reading The Crimson, however, you’d think the president’s policies broke the economy by themselves. Bush-hating revisionists use the unpopularity of our 43rd president to discredit conservative policies in general. But Bush’s failure to regulate financial and housing markets should not be confused with his success in economic growth, trade, education, and health care.
A common refrain of revisionists is that Bush foolishly pursued “deregulation” by cutting taxes. They simply throw out the term “Bush tax cuts” followed by a non sequitur explaining why the economy is suffering. However, tax cuts are not deregulation. Deregulation implies a change in the rules and restrictions that structure markets, while tax cuts instead put money in the pockets of American consumers to use within the existing regulatory environment. Plus, not all deregulation is created equal: The poor accounting standards that led to the Enron scandal have nothing to do with the lax supervision of securities that resulted in the current crisis. Still, revisionists continue to lump tax cuts in with lax oversight in their vapid judgments of Bush.
Revisionists also ignore the success of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts: After their implementation, GDP grew uninterrupted for five years at an average rate of 4.1 percent, businesses created five million new jobs, and lower top marginal rates created incentives for unforeseen innovation. In fact, without the Bush tax cuts the economic downturn might have been harder on the poor. His plan increased the child tax credit and reduced rates for lower-middle-class families. The only substantive critique leveled by revisionists at the Bush tax cuts is that they widened budget deficits. But, if deficits caused the recession, it’s curious that Democrats now propose to fix the economy with even more deficit spending.
Other than tax policy, Bush’s efforts in other areas of the economy led to significant successes that have likely mitigated the current recession. Besides the Central American Free Trade Agreement, he more than quadrupled the number of trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries and would have implemented others with nations like Colombia had congressional Democrats let him. Expansions of free trade offer a potential first step to economic recovery: After all, in the beginning throes of the crisis in 2007, it was double-digit annualized export growth that kept GDP growing despite lagging consumption and investment. 
Meanwhile, the No Child Left Behind Act has led to steady if modest improvement in education performance (especially among minorities), which is needed to prepare Americans for the 21st-century jobs that will lead us out of recession. Private health care and Medicare benefits also increased substantially under President Bush. Incidentally, they are the reason that wages, which are only part of employee compensation, were supposedly stagnant under his administration. Productivity expanded, in part because Bush avoided dangerous policies like card-check, which President Obama, in the middle of a recession, now foolishly advocates. Finally, the administration’s efforts on climate change resulted in 2006 in the first decline in carbon emissions in a non-recession year since 1990, without draconian or punitive regulations that would weigh down business in today’s economic climate.
Bush’s actions on taxation, trade, health care, education, and climate more likely cushioned the economic collapse than contributed to it. The Bush administration, the Clinton administration and both Republican and Democratic Congresses all deserve blame for their failures in financial market regulation and shortsighted home ownership initiatives. To blame Bush’s entire domestic policy agenda for the economic crisis, however, mistakes correlation for causation in the worst way.

In 2006, Raymond W. McDaniel, Jr., chairman and CEO of Moody’s Corporation, proclaimed, “I firmly believe that Moody’s business stands on the ‘right side of history’ in terms of the alignment of our role and function with advancements in global capital markets.” Editorialists, pundits, and lawmakers alike have scrutinized this sentiment over the past year, debating the role that credit-rating agencies played in the subprime crisis. Instead of the blame game it used to be, this debate has recently become a more fruitful discussion between the public and private sectors—policymakers and rating agencies—about how to better design the process of rating securities and minimize conflicts of interest. “The status quo isn’t good enough,” said SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro at a roundtable discussion on the subject last week. While some problems with rating agencies are indeed structural, there are more basic issues of risk-taking behavior at stake that cannot be changed simply through regulation, cooperation, or incentives.
Moody’s, like rival firms Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch, Inc., follows a “corporation-paid” model, in which the corporation issuing a security pays for Moody’s to rate that security. This creates a conflict of interest. Since rating agencies want to keep a steady flow of business, they have good reason to overrate securities and make their customers—the issuers—happy. Indeed, rating agencies in the past have given collaborative feedback to issuers to such an extent, some argue, that their ratings were no longer objective.
While proposed solutions help fix conflicts of interest, more inevitably arise. A simple alternative would be to return to the “investor-paid” model that rating agencies followed pre-1968, when S&P began charging issuers for ratings, in addition to the subscription fee they had always collected from investors who used the ratings. Yet, as many firms argue—both in 1968 and in recent months, when the model has again been proposed as a viable solution—relying solely on a subscription service does not bring in enough revenue to allow rating agencies to innovate and keep up with increasingly complex financial products. Other officials have focused on fixing the mechanics of this structure. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, for example, announced an agreement with rating agencies in June in which issuers simply pay for rating agencies to review the securities with no requirement to produce a rating. Relieving this pressure to produce could foster objectivity and minimize conflicts of interest. In that case, though, the problem of being paid to judge your boss’s daughter, so to speak, still remains. The Cuomo plan does not change the “corporation-paid” model and its attendant conflicts of interest.
How, then, can regulators and businessmen alike mitigate this conflict? The most logical initial step is to place renewed emphasis on the investor’s responsibility to rely on a constellation of datapoints, rather than one datapoint, when she makes an investment.
John Moody anticipated this problem when he published the first Moody’s Analyses of Railroad Investments in 1909. Moody prefaced the book with a note about its scope, cautioning that it was “in no sense a ‘manual’” and instead a tool to enable investors to “analyze the conditions back of all security values.” Like his future competitors, Moody specifically intended his credit ratings to enable analysis rather than be ends in themselves. Nonetheless, by 1970, when the firm switched to a “corporation-paid” model, Moody’s ratings had become decisive factors for investors. In fact, by 1970, ratings from Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch had become such an important part of bringing securities to market that Moody’s felt it necessary to capitalize on the “market access” their ratings provided by charging issuers. The SEC’s decision to classify Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch as “nationally recognized statistical rating organizations” in 1975 didn’t help matters, as this imposed a rubber stamp that reinforced ratings as standalone measures of risk. 
The problem here involves both agencies like Moody’s, with its horde of analysts, and the investors they inform—and so does the solution. It evidences a broader issue that technology and innovation bring to all facets of life: carelessness. If you can find the answer by searching Google or glancing over a Wikipedia article, why read a book? If you can rely on a credible rating for a complex financial security, why do further research? In a narrow sense, the lack of context attendant in these bursts of data leads to small errors, and, on a broader scale, this limited scope contributes to major market failures.
Many of these credit-rating agencies are beginning to argue that their ratings are informed opinions, not answers, just as Moody described in 1909. Thus, some claim, they should be exempt from rebuke. According to The Wall Street Journal, many credit-rating agencies intend to use the constitutional right to free speech as a defense against upcoming litigation cases. While this may be juridical truth, and a clever defense, conflicts of interest and careless behavior will remain even under the old, investor-paid model. All the regulators can do is continue to effectively cooperate with rating agencies, working to create a better—albeit imperfect—system.
As for the rest of us, we can do no more than take a moment to think. It’s worth it.

Since publishing Prestige and Mobility, The Harvard Crimson, previously known only for heteronormative [1] undertones, has seen tremendous ad revenue growth. [2] In thanks, they have given us a genius grant to test our new mind reading device. We have published our initial results in the tradition of great UC meeting live blogs. Our research, which was conducted during prefrosh weekend, is presented below: 12:37 p.m.: Look at this red folder. What high-quality paper products. It’s clear the school cares about me. It’s like I’m irreplaceable to them. This folder is a treasure chest of the experiences I’m coming to Harvard for. A chance to see a Gutenberg Bible? A debate between two campus political groups? An ice cream social (for the world’s best high school students!)? Many would be intimidated, but not me. I excelled at the high-school level, both inside and outside the classroom. Mostly inside: my mom says I was born an “indoor kid.” 12:48 p.m.: I’m glad I left early for this THURJ info session. [3] I have time to think of compliments for the members, and I can establish some social capital with these mostly symmetrical prefrosh while we walk. Don’t blow it this time. Remember freshman year of high school: a signature fedora? Every day? What was I thinking? Not now. I just need a cool topic. Sports. I’ll talk about soccer. No, soccer’s too gay. What about basketball? No, not classy enough. “Hey, who here plays motorcycle polo?” Oh, no. Oh, no. They’re walking faster. They know I can’t keep up—being an “indoor kid.” If I can just make fun of someone else to assert my dominance...that prefrosh doesn’t even have a folder! He’s selling newspapers? Is he already comping The Crimson? Everyone knows that Comping “Current”=Being a Baller. My new friends are walking faster. “Hey, nice shirt! Hey, the paper’s called ‘The Crimson,’ not ‘Spare Change.’” Maybe they’re just fast walkers.1:18 p.m.: I can’t believe I can eat whatever I want. An individual piece of chicken fried just for me with buns nearby? Alpine Strawberry or Antediluvian Chocolate? Nice. It seems like I can sit with anyone and just introduce myself. Four years of friendly classmates? I’ll take seconds! I can just casually bring up that stern lady who swiped us all in. We all have that in common! Easy introduction. It seems like all of the African-American students are at one table. This wasn’t in the folder! This wasn’t in the folder! How can I complete my group of multi-ethnic friends as seen in the admissions brochure? I head to the back. Look at that statue. John Adams! My favorite. A closer look...Shit! The alarm! Run, just run. They might rescind my admission—or hurt my chances of enrolling in Freshman Seminar 34[1/2]x: “Chastity in an Age of Cyber Warfare.” Run. 9:30 p.m.: Doo-wop, beep, shee-wah-bop-pow. What an a capella smackdown! Wow, it’s like the voices WERE the instruments. I want to join an a capella group, but who would want me, anyhow? I couldn’t even get into the Fallen Angels. Man, those girls have it all. Sure, I turn to drugs and alcohol sometimes to get by, but who doesn’t? Life’s tough. Do you know how many AP 5s I got? Nine. 9:36 p.m.: Looking for a party. Found a place that looked like it would be bumping (and grinding?!) all night: Lamont Café. I was pretty sure prefrosh didn’t usually get into final clubs, so I  played it cool and only talked about my SAT I and never my SAT IIs. I ate a stale raspberry Danish and chilled in the VIP section, by the newspapers. Show them bitches no love. 9:41 p.m.: I’ma keep a low profile with a decaf chai latte and eye potential biddies. High school hasn’t gone so well for me with women. Sure, I once reached first base on a balk, but I got out by a fielder’s choice. [4] College will go better now that I’m reinventing myself. I strut over to a girl, hit her book out of her hand and say, “Do you have any idea how many free t-shirts I got today?” She doesn’t respond, so I lean in and whisper, “Seven.” Yeah, we pretty much frenched. [1] Oh, Microsoft Word Paper Clip, “heteronormative” isn’t a word? Looks like we just found one wiry, wound-up bigot![2] Couples seeking 5’7”-5’10” albino Sephardic Jewish egg donors with 2300+ SATs, come on down![3] Editor’s Note: THURJ, we put you on the map. We expect some quid pro quo, such as, Undergraduate Research on whether Shaq is the new fun czar.[4] Infield fly rule=unexpected and unwelcome unzipping of pants; bunt=kissing her hand and then attempting to move to lips; Kirby Puckett=her ex-boyfriend; third base=vague; hit by pitch=hit by bus while kissing date; first base coach=guy who helps you make out; Cal Ripken, Jr.=making out with same girl 2,632 consecutive times; called third strike=leave theater, get popcorn, return, date absent; inside the park home run=artificial insemination; suicide squeeze= “DO ME OR I’LL KILL MYSELF”; Registrar Barry S. Kane=inventor of the suicide squeeze.

Are dogs really man’s best friend? The Harvard Cognitive Evolution Lab in William James Hall, now home to more than 1,000 dogs, may hold the answer. The dogs will be used in behavior studies, which, according to Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser, the leader of the study, will reveal “the extent to which domestication will change dogs into the proximity of human thinking.” The lab formerly housed 40 cottontop tamarin monkeys but were recently replaced by dogs because of the high cost of caring for the monkeys. This switch from monkeys to dogs has struck fear into the hearts of many on-campus dog-lovers, who worry that the dogs will be used in harsh tests. “They don’t hook the dogs up to those crazy electro things, do they?” wonders Cabot Librarian and campus-renowned animal-lover Ronald N. Lacey. “All of the studies are benign,” assures Hauser. “The dogs will get free rewards for finding things.” The study will explore dogs’ sensitivity to human interaction and cues. “We are trying to understand whether dogs’ behavior really reflects the way we see and feel about the world,” says Hauser. “Dogs are very sensitive to human cues, such as following a finger to a target object.” While monkeys and chimpanzees have been used in similar studies, Hauser believes that dogs have a higher ability to follow such human cues. “Chimpanzees are much closer in many ways, in terms of genetics, but cannot follow this cue that we have been following since infancy.” While this mental sophistication might come as a surprise to some, an avid dog-lover attests to the study’s truth. “Of course it doesn’t surprise me that dogs behave more similarly to humans than chimps,” says Melissa C. Oppenheim ’12. “Dogs are man’s best friends.”

It’s Friday night, 11 p.m., and you’re walking back to your dorm room from Lamont, excited for a quiet and restful night off. You round the corner of Mass Ave and Plympton, and you’re suddenly confronted with a massive, buzzing cluster of pubescent high schoolers, sporting sweatshirts and toting Rubinoff-filled gatorate bottles. “Yo, man,” says the self-delcared leader, “know of any parties going on tonight?” You run off before you’re forced to respond. Welcome to prefrosh weekend. Sure, many of us dread prefrosh weekend; there’s nothing more annoying than a crowd of overeager teenage nerds desperately praying that they can pass for an undergrad as they nervously make their way through the square. But I consider the weekend a time for us college kids to reflect on how far we’ve come. It wasn’t so long ago that many of us wandered through the unfamiliar streets of Cambridge ourselves, imagining the endless possibilities of scintillating lectures, keg parties, late-night debates over Lolita in hipster coffee shops, and access to endless alcohol, or at least a really good fake ID. Of course, the reality turns out to be a little different, and it’s nice to be reminded of our former naivete. But perhaps these prefrosh are on to something. Whatever happened to that sense of hope and possibility that we once had? Have we grown numb or is college really not all that we had anticipated? Have we learned anything since we’ve been here? Where has that sense of ambition and confidence gone? And then, just when you’re about to doubt our entire college experience, you hear a prefrosh puking in the bathroom down the hall, and are reminded that yes, you have in fact grown, matured, and learned at least one invaluable piece of information: beer before liquor, never been sicker.

It’s that time of year again: time for an infiltration of blaringly red folders and ubiquitous smiling faces. Yes, pre-frosh weekend has arrived—when eager, starry-eyed youngsters come to Harvard, still high on the rush of receiving their thick envelopes in the mail. Don’t get me wrong, I simply love spending my Saturday night with a kid smart enough to win the National Spelling Bee. Except when she comes back shit-faced from her first ever final club outing, only to puke all over my brand new rug. FML.  Can you spell that, little one?Oh, and of course I’m totally into the number droppers—the ones who find the need to casually bring up their 2400’s and 4.0’s, as if they were contributing to some thread on College Confidential. Well, here’s some news for you: I’ve got enough stats to deal with for my pset due Friday. Oh, and nobody cares. Okay, okay, maybe I’m being a little harsh. So, I’ll answer some typical pre-frosh questions like a good Harvard host:1. Are people actually normal here? No, we’re all secretly commies conspiring to take over the world. Why do you think all your folders are red? Just kidding. Well, at least not all of us. 2. How’s the dating scene? Let me know when you find one. Wait a minute, what’s the name of that pre-frosh guy you were with earlier?3. Is Harvard a lot of work? I’m working on my 1,000,000th response paper as we speak. What do you think?And you know what the worst part of all of this is? As hard as I may try to scare the little ones away, somehow they (almost) always make their valiant return come fall: ready to embark on a year of Domna’s swipes, all proudly donning their class t-shirts. Maybe I’m just bitter I never got mine.

Before the recession hit, establishing a presence in the Persian Gulf was fast becoming the “in” thing for American universities: Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service in Doha, New York University in Abu Dhabi, Michigan State University in Dubai—the list goes on and on. So being the global, ambitious, and well-endowed institution that it is, it’s no surprise that Harvard is keeping up with the times.
Meet the Harvard Medical School Dubai Center (HMSDC), a collaboration between the medical school, Partners Harvard Medical International, and Dubai Healthcare City, or DHCC. 
Established as a response to Dubai’s call for improved health care infrastructure, HMSDC has served as both an educational institution and a hub for research on health problems endemic to the area, as well as health care strategies that could be applied worldwide. And even in the face of the global economic recession, it is still going strong. 
NOT JUST ANOTHER AMERICAN CAMPUSA few years ago, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, then emir of Dubai, expressed concerns that health care levels in the United Arab Emirates were not up to par. The government of Dubai then approached Harvard for a center for medical education and research.
“A quality health care system is derived around an academic medical center,” says Richard G. Mills, Dean for Operations and Business Affairs at HMS.
Harvard agreed to help Dubai with its mission of modernizing health care, and in 2004, the HMSDC was launched. In addition to the research, the center offers programs in graduate education such as residencies and continuing education for established medical professionals. Located in DHCC, a zone designated by the emirate specifically for medical and pharmaceutical development, the center can also work with the DHCC-operated University Hospital.
However, unlike other American medical campuses that have been established in the Middle East, HMSDC offers no degree programs, and Harvard has no plans to establish a full-blown HMS campus in Dubai.
“Rather than establishing a franchised medical center in the Middle East, we want to help Dubai develop its own academic medical center,” says Mills. “We believe it’s a more robust approach.”
David E. Golan ’75, dean for graduate education at HMS, finds that taking such an approach gets local practitioners and researchers more invested in the project, and also allows for easier communication among them. Harvard-affiliated physicians will be brought in to teach, but any medical program that is eventually offered will be based around University Hospital rather than HMS. However, many of these programs are still only in the planning stage.
 “There’s a long way to go between where they are now and a true academic medical center,” says Golan. “But this is the ultimate vision.”
ONLY IN DUBAIApart from the educational aspect, Dubai offers many unique opportunities in terms of clinical research, and Harvard researchers have already done significant work.
“We take advantage of problems that are common in the area and lend themselves to investigation,” says Ajay K. Singh, Chief Academic Officer at HMSDC and Executive Director of the Dubai Harvard Foundation for Medical Research, which spearheads research efforts in the area. For example, two major issues in the Middle East are autism and diabetes, which alone affects over 25 percent of the population, according to Singh. 
Dubai also provides a rare chance to experiment with health care. On the one hand, because Dubai currently has no academic medical center, researchers get to see the actual effects of different initiatives on the quality of health care delivery, according to Golan. On the other hand, unlike other nations that lack a deep-rooted health care framework, Dubai has the resources to build a first-world health care delivery structure from the ground up.
“We don’t have the ability to do that [in the United States] because we’re not starting with a clean slate,” says Mills. “But there is just as much a need to redevelop here.” 
The U.S. is in luck—the reforms that prove to be effective can easily be imported to its own system.
PRESSING FORWARDThe economic crisis has hit much of the developed world, but it has especially affected Dubai. As the least oil-rich of the seven emirates, Dubai generates most of its revenue from trade, real estate, and finance—all industries which have slowed significantly. As might be expected, the Dubai Center has not gone unscathed.
Construction on the HMSDC building was halted for some time before a new contract could be negotiated, while progress on the pending five-star hotel in DHCC has been halted.
Verdi J. DiSesa ‘72, the surgeon-in-chief at University Hospital, says that there have been realistic considerations regarding progress on the center, such as prolongation of recruitment and program development efforts. However, he remains positive on the long-term Singh is also optimistic about the prospects for the center’s operations.
“The economic situation has affected all entities, whether it’s Harvard University in Boston or other academic institutions around the world,” says Singh. “But we plan to conduct the same amount of academic activities this year as we did last year, and we’re actually doing some at a higher level this year.”
Mills is encouraged by the willingness of Dubai’s leadership in staying committed to the project, citing the continued construction of the city’s monorail system as an example of the Dubai leadership’s dedication to public projects.
“There’s a long way to go, but there is evidence of a real commitment to change within their country,” he says. “We’re feeling quite hopeful.”

Serving up some spirit with your spirits and spicy conversation with your Doritos, the owner of Louie’s Superette–the local convenience store and go-to for many residents of the River Houses–has more in store than most casual shoppers might imagine.
Cheng-San Chen, known by his customers as Louie, has run Louie’s Superette since he purchased it from its previous owner in 1987. Located at the corner of Surrey and Putnam Streets, Louie’s attracts students seeking booze and carbs of all kinds.
“He’s got anything you’d ever want,” says Ian D. Duff ’10. “Louie’s the man.”
Doritos and Tostitos deck the aisles, and an entire section in the back is dedicated to wines alone. A bright orange sign advertises a new organic wine, imported from Italy. And it’s only $12.99.
“He always talks about how he keeps his prices on par with local stores,” says Thomas Rodger E. Rodger ’09. 
Indeed, Chen insists that his motivations for running the store are not merely financial. 
“It’s not about money,” he affirms. “I wouldn’t be working here if it was.”
LEARNED LOUIE 
But that’s not the only thing that might surprise Chen’s customers. In fact, his unassuming demeanor belies his many hidden talents. 
“I have too many degrees,” he jokes. “I’ve got a bachelors, a masters, and a Ph.D.”
His extensive background in engineering, physics, and mathematics led the store owner to work initially with technology. He was on the design team for Digital Equipment Corporation, where he worked with everything from application software and CPU to hardware. But his stint in the world of technology didn’t prove entirely satisfying for Chen, who yearned to connect with people.
“I talked more to machines than people back then,” he jests.
In an effort to merge his technological prowess with his desire for a more social work environment, Chen started teaching his knowledge by conducting computer classes. 
“I mostly enjoy when people are smart and wanting to learn,” he said, explaining that this is one of the reasons he so enjoys being a store owner, with Mather and Dunster Houses neighboring his establishment. “I love talking with the students. I’m talking to the future leaders of the world.”
A SOCIAL STREAK
While Chen says that the store normally sees several hundred shoppers a day, he insists that he is nonetheless able to form relationships with individual customers. 
“My former employees and customers- they come back years later and they ask: ‘Do you remember me?’ and I do. I remember their faces,” he says.  
And so he does.
“What up, Lou?” asks a middle-aged man who walks in to purchase a six-pack and some gum one recent weekday evening. 
Chen responds with a smile, calling the man by name and asking about his family and kids. One woman, who says she is from Taiwan and lives close by the store, stays to chat for over twenty minutes. 
“I love getting to talk to many people,” says Chen. “It is my favorite part of the job.”
His propensity to engage with his customers and learn about their lives goes beyond casual conversation. 
A couple of years ago, after Harvard’s football victory over Yale, Chen gave the team some free kegs to celebrate. 
“The first thing the guys said after they won was ‘somebody go tell Louie!’” Chen recalls with a laugh. “I also gave them two cases of champagne.”
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
And luckily for students, and perhaps especially the football team, Chen plans on sticking around for a while.
“I tried to sell the store a few years back,” he said, “But the guy messed up. I let him borrow money from me and he never paid me back. And he didn’t check IDs as he should, and the students complained about him. So I came back. I don’t trust other people with the store now.”
But would he sell the store if he did find someone he deemed capable?
“No. No I wouldn’t,” he says simply, as if he has been asked a strange question. 
And watching him joke around with yet another customer, claiming he’s trying to collect all 50 states in his display of confiscated IDs, it sure seems to make sense that he’d want to stick around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nations should take further steps to guard against the spread of disease in the event of a future biological weapons attack or contagious outbreak, Institute of Politics Fellow Howard A. Zucker said yesterday. The remarks by the former assistant director-general of the World Health Organization came in the midst of a talk about the often neglected relationship between the health of a nation and its security at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs yesterday. Zucker struck a frank note about the impending possibility of international health threats.  “The data shows that about three times a century, you’ll have a pandemic,” Zucker said during the event. “It is true, we are due for one.”Zucker noted that while the United States has been fortunate in avoiding health scares like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the avian flu in recent years, it is certainly not exempt from possible future outbreaks.“If we think we can outwit Mother Nature, we have another thing coming to us,” Zucker said. “We’re not done with the issue of pandemics. Something else will come forth.”To improve the world’s ability to combat future outbreaks, Zucker supported the adoption of a set of 2007 World Health Organization recommendations advocating things like increased transparency and cooperation among nations in matters of public health.“A healthy society is truly a more secure society,” Zucker said.Zucker’s direct style struck a chord with some in the audience.“I think it was important for him to remind us that despite all the technology and the medical feats we’ve accomplished in the past 50 to 100 years, there are still always going to be mutations and something we have to look out for,” said Belfer Center fellowship coordinator Mary A. Crowley after the event. “We can’t be as blind to these things as we’d like to be.”

On New Year’s Day in 2003, Mike Kim left his comfortable job as a financial planner in Chicago and traveled to the border between North Korea and China—a place where thousands of North Koreans go to flee oppression and famine suffered under a closed communist government. He had no immediate plans to return. The eventual author of “Escaping North Korea: Defiance and Hope in the World’s Most Repressive Country”—a book that documents his time trafficking North Korean refugees through a 6,000-mile modern-day underground railroad—Kim trained part-time with Tae Kwon Do instructors in order to get a visa to live in China. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to the human rights efforts that would become the subject of his book.  “You can be imprisoned in China for simply feeding a North Korean refugee,” Kim said to an audience in Pound Hall at the Law School last night, highlighting what he called “one of the worst human rights crises in the world”—the situation facing North Koreans fleeing their country. Kim said that he first learned about the human rights issues in the North Korean border region during a vacation to China earlier in 2003. “I asked my assistant to clear my calendar for two weeks so I could travel to China,” he said. “I wanted to try some authentic Chinese food.”While in China, Kim met a North Korean refugee for the first time in a shelter. “I felt really disengaged from it all when I came back from China,” said Kim. “I wanted to do something to help the North Koreans.”For much of the talk, Kim read passages from his book on topics ranging from the young North Korean refugees, whom he called “child warriors,” to North Korea’s sex trafficking problem.He recalled one trip when he took four North Korean teenagers from the border to the consulate in Shanghai where he knew they could be temporarily protected.“They have endured what the [United Nations] has labeled a modern-day famine in North Korea.” One of the teenagers received a bowl of white rice as his birthday gift every year, Kim said on the severity of the hunger crisis in North Korea.The route over which Kim trafficked refugees runs from North Korea, through China and four other countries where the refugees are not officially recognized, to Thailand, which is currently the only country of the six that has opened its borders to North Korean refugees.Now an MBA student at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, Kim is also the founder of Crossing Borders Ministries, a non-governmental organization dedicated to assisting North Korean refugees in China.“For Law School students, we want to hear about the plight of refugees and the legal system, but it’s also useful to hear personalized accounts of what we can do to be advocates,” said Cosette D. Creamer, a second-year law school student who helped organize the event on behalf of the Harvard Law School Advocates for Human Rights.Kim said he will continue to work on raising awareness about the refugees.“It is seen as a largely Korean issue,” he said. “So we are trying to get people outside of the Korean community involved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a town hall discussion this weekend, a group of Massachusetts environmental activists called for the federal government to implement a plan by former Vice President Al Gore ’69 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. electric generation within 10 years.Speakers at the discussion—which was co-sponsored by Harvard’s Environmental Action Committee—said that Gore’s plan, known as “RePower America,” was highly viable because it focused on the importance of dealing with carbon dioxide emissions on a national level, and not on a state level.“Massachusetts can be the national leader in this,” said Kate Chang, a staff member to Massachusetts congressman Michael E. Capuano.  “We can be the ones to bounce back first and stronger—we’re not in debt, our political leaders are on board and we have the brain power not only in the five-college area,” Chang said.Gore’s campaign outlines the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere from its current level of 387 parts per million to below 350 parts per million. Activists at the town hall event said that in the short term, they would focus on encouraging their state representatives to support Gore’s initiative. “Our larger campaign of demonstrating support for bold and ambitious action on climate change here in Massachusetts will have an effect on the climate negotiations through our Senator John Kerry,” said Craig S. Altemose, co-coordinator of Massachusetts Power Shift, a state network of climate activists. “The more we can show him support exists in our state for strong solutions, the better he will be able to negotiate a strong treaty for us.” Audience members said that this weekend’s town hall meeting opened a forum to demonstrate broad-based community support for clean energy and to put interested community members and groups in touch with organizations campaigning locally for clean energy.“It showed a growing interest in the 8th congressional district [of Massachusetts] for RePower America,” said spectator Todd A. Mooring, referring to Gore’s plan. Altemose said that he believed that the staff members of elected officials in attendance had obtained a better understanding of the pressing need for states to become involved in national energy issues. “Just as importantly,” he said. “[the town hall] helped to further deepen a growing relationship between our network of students and our congressional representative.”The discussion, held in the First Parish Cambridge Unitarian Universalist Church, included panelists from “Clean Water Action,” “Massachusetts Green Jobs Coalition,” and “Green Corps.”—Staff writer Carola A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clarifying the Law School’s move to a
pass/fail grading system last October, Acting
Dean of Harvard Law School Howell
E. Jackson announced in an e-mail to
students late last week that the school will
make its grade distribution public and
change the criteria for awarding coveted
Latin honors.
The newly released details reveal that
the Law school will now award its Latin
honors—cum, magna cum, and summa
cum laude distinctions—on a proportional
basis, with the summas going to
the top one percent, magnas to the next
10 percent, and cum laudes awarded to
the final thirty percent of graduates.The new policy guarantees that each
class will contain a handful of summas—a departure from previous policy in
which the Law school only awarded its
highest honor to students meeting the
astronomical benchmark of a 7.2 minimum
GPA. Because the benchmark was
absolute, the Law School had routinely
graduated consecutive classes without
awarding a single student the summa
cum laude.
But by assuring the presence of summas
in each graduating class, some students
say that the administration has
eliminated the rarity that had historically
distinguished the award.
“This clearly changes the meaning of
the summa,” said Nikhil V. Gore, a first year
student.
The new disclosures come months after
the school shifted from traditional letter-based grading to a four-tiered pass/fail
system, leaving open the question of how
precisely the tiers would be distinguished.
That question was resolved in Jackson’s
disclosures last week. Next year’s student handbook will include a
recommended grade distribution
that encourages professors to award
Honors to 37 percent of the class,
Pass to 55 percent, and Low Pass to
the remaining 8 percent.
Since the departure of former
Law School Dean Elena Kagan for
the Obama Administration, the
school has moved forward with its
grading reforms under Jackson, the
acting dean.
A number of students praised
the clarifications to the grading
policy yesterday, citing the increased
transparency as a welcome
departure from Kagan, who had
been resistant to releasing the grading
curve.
Still, concerns remain that the
new grading policy may not achieve
its stated goal of tempering the
grade-focused culture at the law
school.
Encouraging professors to award
a surprisingly large number of Honors
grades may actually increase the
pressure to attain Honors, according
to Brian T. Aune, a second-year
student and the president of the
school’s student government.
He said that he is concerned that
the change will place a renewed emphasis
on grades as student seek to
avoid the stigma of losing out to
over a third of their classmates.
The switch has caused anxiety
among some top achievers who fear
that employers will be unable to
distinguish their academic record
from that of other top students.
In response, the Law School announced
that professors who teach
classes with more than 30 students
will be allowed to award Dean’s
Scholar Prizes—a distinction that
is intended to replace the A+ in the
previous grading system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Molly R. Siegel ’10 tried running the Boston Marathon last year, she collapsed at mile 22 out of 26.2 and ended up in the hospital with a bad case of heat stroke.But yesterday, despite that unfortunate experience, Siegel finished this year’s Boston Marathon as one of the participants in the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, a fundraising effort that began in 2005 to raise money for the Phillips Brooks House Association and Project HEALTH, an undergraduate organization that provides social services to low-income families.“It was amazingly moving,” she said. “It’s the quintessential Boston event.”Running a marathon has always been one of Siegel’s personal goals, leading her to decide to try the Boston Marathon—the world’s oldest annual marathon—which takes place on Patriots’ Day and draws about 20,000 competitors from around the world each year.Though most race participants need to submit qualifying times for the competition, HCMC participants receive invitation entries on the basis of their charity fundraising. Each student sets a goal of raising $2000.The HCMC runners started in rural Hopkinton at 10:30 a.m. and continued through Framingham, Wellesley, and Cleveland Circle, breaking the 26.2 mile-finish line in Boston’s Copley Square.Many of the Harvard faculty, staff, and students who ran cited the bell-ringing and cheering crowd as the most exciting part of the race.Siegel raced with her name inscribed on her Harvard goldenrod jersey, and heard complete strangers along the sidelines screaming “Go Molly” and “Go Harvard!”“At one point at Heartbreak Hill, one guy yelled ‘You must be wicked smart!’” Siegel said.Other runners described a similar feeling of overwhelming support yesterday. “You feel like a movie star because there’s a line of people waiting to give you high fives.” Bronwen B. O’Herin ’12 said. “The kids [on the sidelines] are adorable—they hand out orange slices.”“One even gave me a Twizzler,” she said.Samuel T. Moulton ’01, a Teaching Fellow in Psychology and a tutor in Dunster House, said that the crowd made the race “a pure experience of joy.”“It was a really nice side of humanity that you never see,” he said. When asked about the halfway point of the race at Wellesley College—its cheering crowd is called the “Scream Tunnel”—Moulton said that he could hear their roar from pretty far back in the distance.“[It’s] a crazy tunnel of crazy college girls holding signs, and you kiss them—that’s something else that I’ve never experienced before,” he said.Several of the runners said that they had very little competitive running experience before participating in the HCMC.Moulton said that he had not set foot in the Malkin Athletic Center before training for this year’s marathon. But because his personal interests lay in running and public service, HCMC presented a perfect opportunity. He added that the money he raised this year will be given to a PBHA prison tutoring program for which he volunteered as an undergraduate. Brett P. Thomas ’10 said that he had never raced competitively before either, but that he was “thrilled about how it turned out.” “You only go to college in Boston once,” he said. “Why not try to run the Boston Marathon?”—Staff writer Victor W.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the General Education
curriculum was approved by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences nearly
two years ago, preparations for a
transition away from the Core have
slowly been taking shape.
Now, current students will have
the chance to experiment with the
new curriculum—having the option
to elect to fulfill requirements
under Gen Ed or the Core. Though
the choice is available for all, it represents
a far more viable possibility
for current freshmen.
But while Advising Fortnight,
which concluded on Sunday, encouraged
current first-years to consider their concentration options,
few freshmen feel that they
are being properly educated about
their impending choice between
Gen Ed and the Core.
Still others feel that the decision-making process is a hassle, or
that they are getting shortchanged
because of their status as a transition
class.
“It’s really annoying that we
have to choose which one to take.
I thought I would like it, but it actually
just makes things really confusing,
and I feel like neither program
is at its strongest right now,”
said Sofie C. Brooks ’12. “So I am
getting the short end of the stick
no matter what I choose.”
In order to make their decisions, students will either need seasoned and
knowledgeable advisers or will have
to be proactive in seeking information.
They will have to weigh course
availability in each program, oscillating concentration possibilities and the
structure of each curriculum in making
a decision.
And while the incoming Class of
2013 will not have a choice to make
with regard to curriculum, it is unclear
what their understanding of Gen Ed
might be upon matriculation.
TO MAKE THE CHOICE
The nature of freshman advising is
such that some students may end up
with an adviser who is directly involved
in the implementation of Gen Ed—Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay
M. Harris was on the board of freshman
advisers last year—while others
may be assigned first-year graduate students
at one of Harvard’s other schools.
This variability leads to differing degrees
of preparedness among academic
advisers in directing freshmen about
which curricular option to choose.
Brooks, whose adviser is a grad student,
said she thought “the College has
not done a good job at advising me
which one would be best.”
But Alex M. Sarkisian ’12, whose adviser
Christina McFarlane works in the
Freshman Dean’s office and has a joint
appointment with the Advising Programs
Office, wrote in an e-mail that he
was “properly informed of all information
by [his] counselor.”
Information is available on the Gen
Ed program’s Web site for students who
may be proactive enough to seek it out
on their own.
The site features a little-known
tool for students trying to decide between
the two programs. The “Planning
Worksheet (Gen Ed vs. Core)” is
a downloadable PDF file that students
can fill out based on prospective concentration
possibilities, allowing them
to see which program better suits their
needs. The worksheet asks students to
find courses that fulfill the requirements
in each of the programs, check
off completed requirements, and evaluate
their findings.
MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER
In making the decision, course
availability has been raised as a cause
for concern, as many have worried that
students will have a smaller course selection
under Gen Ed than under the
Core. There are now over 150 courses
available for students to fulfill their
eight Gen Ed category requirements, in
contrast to more than 440 courses that
can still count toward the Core’s seven
requirements.
“They’ve just recently approved a
ton of new courses, which is great. They
were originally concerned about not
having enough courses,” said Robert G.
Doyle, Associate Dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, who is also a freshman
academic advisor. “But I think the
program received a lot of course recommendations
just before the deadline because
professors are just like students—always finishing at the last minute.”
Doyle said that the Core program is
“the more generous route” because it
gives students “more options.” “Because Core courses are still being
offered, if a student decides on Gen Ed
and a Core course sounds more interesting,
they most likely won’t take it,
because most Core courses won’t count
for Gen Ed, whereas Gen Ed can count
towards Core,” Doyle said. Of more concern than course selection
for some students is the prospect
of how each curriculum might fit with
their course of study.
Adriana I. Colón ’12 said that she
has her doubts about whether or not
she has been well-informed about the
Gen Ed versus Core decision, though
she is leaning toward the former. As
she considers a VES concentration with
a secondary field in History or Social
Studies, Colón said that the selection
process between the two programs is
highly dependent on the concentration
she ends up selecting.
“If I end up choosing to create a special
concentration, I feel that it would
be easier to choose Gen Ed instead of
trying to figure out what Core areas I
would have to take or be exempt from,”
she said. “Also, since Gen Ed classes can count for concentration credit as well,
this will leave me with more wiggleroom
for electives and such.”
Brooks, a potential Environmental
Science and Public Policy or Government
concentrator, is also considering
graduating under the Gen Ed requirement.
She said that her trouble deciding
between majors makes Gen Ed the
more appealing option.
“I like the idea of being able to fulfill
requirements without having to worry
about not needing them later, as Gen
Ed has more departmental courses instead
of classes designed only to fulfill a
requirement,” Brooks said. “I don’t like
the idea of taking a class because I have
to—I want to spend my time taking
classes that interest me and also happen
to fulfill requirements at the same
time.”
But since freshman academic advisers
are more accustomed to advising
their students under the Core Program,
they may be more familiar with its
workings.
“Honestly, I just talked to my academic
advisor, who explained what I
needed to do to fulfill the Core requirements,
and it seemed more straightforward,”
wrote Sarkisian, who said he is
fairly sure he will concentrate in Government.
But the decision should not be difficult
or stressful, said Harris, the leading
force behind Gen Ed’s implementation.
Students will have until next fall
to make an official declaration about
which curricular path they will take.
“At the same time you declare a concentration,
you declare the requirement
under which you will graduate,” he said.
“And just as people can change their
concentration, they will have to have
the ability to change programs, too.”
LOOKING FORWARD
Beginning with the incoming Class
of 2013, students will be required to
graduate under Gen Ed.
While the program will continue to
be developed over the summer in time
for the fall 2009 semester, Harvard’s
accepted students can learn very little
about their academic requirements
at present from the Harvard College
Viewbook, which merely lists the eight
required Gen Ed categories.
Admitted student Xing Lin of Metter,
Ga., described the academics section
of the Viewbook he was mailed as
“vague.”
According to Lin, further descriptions
of each of the course categories
would have helped him gain a better
understanding of the academic requirements
he would have to fulfill should he
choose to attend Harvard.
“I wish they gave me examples of
what classes will fall under each category,”
he said.
After being directed to the Gen Ed
Web site, Lin said that he felt the aim
of the program was much clearer, while
the description in the Viewbook made
Harvard’s academic curriculum seem
far more rigid than it is.
“The Web site discusses Harvard’s
new Gen Ed program much more thoroughly,”
said Lin. “I feel that students
have a good course selection for each of
the categories.”
But for now, how the rest of the
Class of 2013 will be informed of Gen
Ed remains to be seen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council faced off yesterday over whether to publicize that it is considering purchasing a four-million dollar property at 45 Mount Auburn Street in a meeting marked by two off-the-record executive sessions—extremely rare interludes that close the proceedings to public and press. The UC-appointed “Social Space Task Force” presented a plan to Council members that proposed the purchase of 45 Mount Auburn Street, currently owned by the Foundation for Civic Leadership, for use as a student community center. The proposal, which has yet to receive any endorsement from any segment of the UC, would require the Council to organize a capital campaign to raise roughly $600,000 as a down-payment on the property. Serious debate erupted about whether the proposal for both the purchase and the capital campaign was sufficiently developed to be circulated to students. UC Representative Joshua J. Nuni ’10 presented the purchasing plan to the Council during one of the closed-door executive sessions at yesterday’s meeting, he said. According to the plan, the extensive capital campaign necessary for the down-payment would begin June 1, with the payment coming Sept. 15.The campaign could involve combining door-knocking campaigns, term-bill charges, rental fees from student groups, and alumni donations—and would entail hiring staff to help conduct the fundraising effort. “This is offering us a chance as a Harvard student body to radically change our culture,” Nuni said of the potential property purchase. “We can decide to create an open, inclusive, student-run, financially independent social space that will be a center for the Harvard student community.”But UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10 said that undertaking a campaign of hundreds of thousands of dollars could significantly distract from the UC’s other responsibilities, including grant-giving and advocacy.“The question is whether the UC is capable of undertaking a capital campaign of this magnitude in this current economic climate,” she said.Bringing the purchasing proposal to students in its present state was “totally irresponsible,” said Flores, according to the minutes from the closed portion of yesterday’s meeting. Flores later confirmed making the statement, and said that she had been suggesting that in its tentative state the proposal could only spur uninformed feedback. But the Council passed the “Social Space Proposal Outreach Act” anyway. The next step in the publication of the proposal will involve establishing a feedback mechanism to assess student interest. The legislation called for the creation of one to five focus groups composed of Council members and students to consider the proposal.The Council voted to go into executive session twice yesterday—drawing upon a measure taken only two other times in the previous two UC administrations. In both prior cases in the past two years, the minutes from the closed portions of the meetings were later released. But the Council voted not to make public the minutes from the first executive session of yesterday’s meeting—a decision that the UC’s Student Affairs Committe Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10 later decried.   “It’s embarrassing that the UC went into executive session twice in one meeting,” Holoshitz said. “That’s not transparent, representative government.”“We’re talking about something that’s a major student concern,” she added. “The fact that there hasn’t been open dialogue so far has been problematic.”Holoshitz said she did not think anything in the minutes deserved to be kept secret.As reflected in the majority vote to close the meeting—and keep it closed—other Council members disagreed with Holoshitz.“We’re discussing legal and real estate matters and it’s better to keep it confidential,” Flores said.The reasons for keeping parts of the meeting closed sprang from a “mix of allowing us to have a full and open discussion and [the fact that] there were things the current owners did not want to be public in The Crimson yet,” UC parliamentarian Eric N. Hysen ’11.—Staff writer Brittany M. Llewellyn  can be reached at bllewell@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

Applied mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner has been appointed as the first Associate Dean for Applied Mathematics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—a position that he will assume in addition to his longtime role as the College’s director of undergraduate studies in Applied Math. The announcement came yesterday from the office of Frans A. Spaepen—the SEAS interim dean and the sole figure responsible for selecting Brenner—who said that Brenner was an obvious choice for the position because he currently occupies a central role in the College’s applied math program.The associate deanship will be filled by a new administrator every two years, alternating between applied math professors with a computer science orientation and those focused on the physical sciences, according to Spaepen.Brenner will fill a position whose function unifies previously dissociated roles within the school. Speaking of the new office, Spaepen said, “These duties in fact were distributed to a whole lot of people, but many were left to [Brenner] as well.” As steward of what he calls “Harvard’s quantitative liberal arts degree,” Brenner has overseen significant growth in a program home to a diverse body of undergraduates. In March, he received the first SEAS Capers and Marion McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising, a prize that recognizes both advising sensitivity and successful curricular experience. In conjunction with SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie Dahleh, he created Applied Math 50, an overview course that offers concentrators an opportunity to explore what field of applied math most interests them. Joan Fang ’11, an applied math concentrator currently enrolled in the course, said that lectures typically present a different aspect of the discipline each week—economics, finance, combinatorics.Fang said that although the class is not required, it provides a useful survey of the material, adding, “I think it’s interesting subject matter, and it’s not terribly stressful.”Brenner’s new position will give him considerable liberty in proposing new staff, directing student advising, and assessing curricular standards within the school’s applied math program, according to Spaepen. Brenner himself expressed enthusiasm for the prospect of centralizing his discipline on campus, noting, “The great thing about Applied Math at Harvard is that it exists everywhere.”—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

Former Seattle City Council Member Peter Steinbrueck has turned down a chance to run for mayor of Seattle so that he can accept a fellowship at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design for the coming academic year.The decision was a difficult one to make, Steinbrueck said, adding that he was “significantly father ahead” of the incumbent mayor in the local polls, but that the chance to study at Harvard proved to be too tempting.“I had two very compelling options before me,” said Steinbrueck.  “I’m committed to political change in the long term.  Harvard would allow me to explore the world of ideas and participate in the exchange of ideas...I’ve just decided to pursue my passion in a more focused way.” Leaving behind support from local citizens and a fan-built Facebook page boasting approximately 900 members, Steinbrueck will come to Harvard next year as one of 10 Loeb fellows.  The program accepts men and women who have visions to improve natural areas and the environment of cities within the United States, according to the Design School’s Web site.  Steinbrueck said that one of the reasons he was drawn to the program was because his father once led an eight-year charge to save the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle—a project very much in keeping with the Loeb fellowship’s emphasis on maintaining and improving urban areas.At Harvard, the self-proclaimed nature lover will follow his self-designed plan of study entitled “Politics, Planning, and Best Practice for Advancing Urban Sustainability.”  While planning to keep his focus somewhat open-ended to allow for inspiration and influence from the Harvard community, Steinbrueck plans to learn about developing and advancing United States urban policy around global sustainability. “Clearly change is needed,” he said.  “How we do that, how we affect change, is what I want to study.”Steinbrueck—who served on the Seattle City Council for 10 years and has served as an urban planning and sustainability consultant since—was nominated for the fellowship by Lisa Richmond, the Executive Director of American Institute of Architects Seattle.“Right now is a very interesting time for [Peter],” said Richmond, a previous recipient of a Loeb Fellowship.  “He is considering his next steps and what his future role in public policy will be.  Peter has been a big part of Seattle leadership surrounding sustainability policy.”Though many of his supporters were disappointed that Steinbrueck will not be running for mayor, they supported his decision to come to Harvard.  “After spending a decade on Seattle’s City Council, this fellowship will allow him to bring his experience with the realities of political process to bear on his passion for sustainability on a much larger scale,” said Susanna Williams, who was the creator of Steinbrueck’s Facebook fan group.  “In return, he will share his insights and perspective with Seattle, helping us grow in more sustainable directions.”Richmond shared similar hopes for Steinbrueck’s return to Seattle.“Everyone wants to see him come back to Seattle,” said Richmond.  “We’re all very interested to see what he does next with the national networks he will develop at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a world of uncertainty, we can often turn to sport as our international language. The universality of watching and appreciating, in its simplest terms, a game between two opposing forces can bring us together to create a common ground transcending ideology, nationality, and race.It is a theory put to the test in the sometimes insular, often elaborate, yet always enthralling web of sport in America.Two years ago, I forsook the rural pleasantries of my sleepy town in northeast Scotland to embark on a grand journey to Harvard. Shuffling restlessly in my economy class seat thousands of feet above the Atlantic Ocean, I could barely contain my excitement—here I was, preparing to study and compete in the country that had dominated athleticism in the 20th century: the country of a defiant Jesse Owens, running in the face of Nazi Aryanization; the country where Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali; the country that bore witness to the “Miracle on Ice”.Only when I stepped off the plane and took my first tentative steps in the New World did I truly begin to perceive the complex beast that is the American sports culture.While chronicling all the lurid details of this extensive subject would require a senior thesis, there are several intriguing facets of this unique environment worth exploring.First, there is the overwhelming variety of sports in the American mainstream—everything from the familiar-yet-unfamiliar “soccer”, to the strange netherworlds of NASCAR racing, WWE wrestling, and lacrosse. For a British student born and bred on a diet of soccer, what is most startling is the strength of the predominant, so-called “Big Three” sports, and their compatibility with one another; baseball, the oldest organized sport in the nation, may be the national pastime, yet it cannot claim to hold a monopoly on the people’s affections—the appeal of football and basketball offer their own substantial challenges. The dominant notion of playoffs and tournament structures in American sport is equally befuddling. Watching the major sporting events in my freshman year with a greater-than-usual sense of confusion, I couldn’t help asking questions: Why can none of these teams settle for a draw?  Why do these competitions featuring only American participants contain the word “world” in their title?  Why is America inclined—contrary to its capitalist ethos—to reward bottom-placed (read “failing”) teams with the first choice in the draft? Come to think of it, why is there a draft?The answers to these questions I do not intend to address here—not only because I’m still pondering them, but because I’m pondering a wider arc.Using the playoff system, the sports seem to favor a quintessentially American approach to competing—a fierce one-off battle between two enemies, clearly defined, with a winner-takes-all scenario. Watching television coverage of these gargantuan clashes can also be an arduous process. Lobotomized by the tedium of repetitive advertisements almost every ten minutes, lectured with empty platitudes by commentator sharks in suits, and itching palms anxiously as you await your latest statistics fix, the excesses of American sport are painfully apparent. In an overly-commercialized world, where agents secure their clients hundreds of millions of dollars to play in Gillette Field, Citi Field and their ilk, it is hard not to be somewhat disillusioned.As my sophomore year draws to a close, my perceptions of this unique sports culture continue to evolve through my experiences writing sports for The Crimson. One of the cornerstones of American sport—and perhaps the most complicated—is the intercollegiate sport system. The arguments for and against this aspect of American life vary widely—from compromised academic standards in the college institutions, to the psychological pressures placed on young athletes by parents and coaches at the high school level or even before. What cannot be denied is its successful role as a conveyor belt of American talent; as a popular and competitive system encouraging sporting excellence, many have attributed Team USA’s Olympic successes to the sizeable investments made by universities in guaranteeing prestige and varsity sporting successes.This development, ensuring the creation of a highly professional environment combining sporting and scholastic pursuits, has seen America become a beacon for aspiring young athletes worldwide. With unparalleled financial muscle, the resources of the colleges continue to stir international curiosity, provide spectacle and further sporting opportunities.Here at Harvard, one is afforded the unique opportunity to not only watch elite collegiate athletes participate in 41 different varsity sports, but also to experience the smoldering embers of Boston’s sporting soul. Walking through Park Street, overhearing drawling voices discussing the fortunes of the Celtics, Pats, Bruins and Sox, you are reminded how deeply interwoven sport is with the fabric of society; you are reminded how, even in the commercially driven world of American sports, the affinity connecting fan and sport is universal.Ultimately, one word can succinctly explain the difference of American sport: scale.  In terms of land mass, it would take slightly over 31 British Islands to fill the United States of America. In a country of three time-zones, where your roommate can go skiing and you to a tropical beach simultaneously, it is hardly a surprise that the US and its collegiate athletic program can not only accommodate more than one major sport, but find a place for minor ones to thrive as well.And in spite of American sports’ oft-inscrutable nature, it seems that Harvard is my ideal point of entry.—Staff writer Allen J.

Looking back on last year’s disappointing 2-17 season, Harvard coach Traci Green set a clear goal for the women’s tennis team at the beginning of this season: become the Ivy League’s most improved team. The Crimson (12-8, 5-1 Ivy) has far exceeded expectations, and the squad is in a position to grab a share of the Ivy League title today if it defeats Dartmouth (8-13, 2-4) at the Beren Tennis Center.  Although reconstructing a team each year can be difficult, the addition of five freshmen to the roster has added a great deal of enthusiasm and force to the team.“I think one of the main success stories of this year’s club has been our work ethic and our team’s dedication to work each week,” Green said. “The freshmen have brought a great deal of energy to our squad. I feel like our upperclassmen are building off their energy, and I think we’re really excited to compete for the Ivy title.”Despite the opportunity to play for a championship, the Crimson’s success didn’t come easily.  After starting the season 2-5, including a close loss to Dartmouth in the ECAC Championships in February, Harvard won five out of six over its spring break trip to California to spark its Ivy League success. “We weren’t quite there [at the beginning of the season],” sophomore Agnes Sibilski said. “We played some other matches, but we knew that the Ivy games were the most important, so we wanted to try and get everyone to peak at this time.  It definitely happened, and everyone was really focused coming into the Ivy League.” One of the keys to the Crimson’s success was making sure that the team developed into a tight and supportive group.  Throughout the season, the team stressed recognizing the importance of team unity, something that can be difficult given the individualistic nature of tennis.  “We’ve built a really cohesive team,” sophomore Samantha Rosekrans said. “If one person is not on top of their game, someone else will step up theirs. Every time we go out not everyone can bring their best day, so I think we’ve been able to work out a system where everyone is really supportive.”This network of support has been significantly facilitated by the freshmen on the roster. Freshman Camille Jania became the first freshman since 2005 to open the dual season 3-1, and she and captain Laura Peterzan have dominated doubles, posting an 8-0 record this season.  Integrating the new members of the team and making sure they found their roles early was important for the upperclassmen.  “The biggest thing that we focused on, especially in the first half of the season, was the freshmen,” Sibilski said. “We really wanted to make sure that they knew exactly what a team was. That can be difficult with tennis, so we wanted to make sure the freshmen knew how tennis worked with our team. We realized early that we had a really good team, so that came pretty easily.”Additionally, freshman Holly Cao rebounded from early-season injuries to post an impressive 7-1 record.  The Crimson attributes its success to playing as a team and collectively reaching toward the same goal, despite the many notable individual performances.“Holly has been great a role model for us…she definitely leads by example,” Rosekrans said.  “Still, everyone is just doing their share. No one sees it as a competition…everyone is on the same page and that has been really helpful.”Perhaps where the unified nature of the women’s tennis team best displays itself has been in the doubles performance.  Harvard has secured all but one doubles point in its Ivy League matches, and has only dropped six overall this season.  “I think that this year we’ve definitely had a strong doubles lineup,” senior Beier Ko said. “Even though it’s one point, it can definitely be huge in a match.”As Ko will play her last home match of her illustrious career today, she cannot help but reiterate the special relationship of the team. “This year has definitely been the closest I’ve felt to my teammates…they are my closest friends at Harvard,” Ko said. “I feel like we’ve all bonded in that way. They are a great bunch. Everyone has their own personality, and it is interesting to have all of the different characters on the team that add up to form a whole.”The combination of this support, closeness, and skill has helped the players recreate their image and stay optimistic as they knock on the door of an 18th Ivy title. “We’re a totally different team than we were in February,” Green said. “I feel like our squad is much more confident, more competent, and we are prepared to beat anybody that comes in our path.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most dangerous team in the playoffs is most often the one with nothing to lose. The Harvard men’s volleyball team will look to prove this axiom correct tonight, as it enters the first round of the EIVA Championship seeded last in the eight-team tournament.
 Making its first post-season appearance since 2005, Harvard (11-7, 6-2 EIVA Hay Division) will take on fifth-seeded George Mason (12-15, 5-7 EIVA Tait Division) at the Field House in Fairfax, Va.
Making a splash in first-year coach Brian Baise’s playoff debut will be anything but easy. Playing the role of underdog perhaps a little too well, the Crimson enters tonight’s contest with an undermanned staff of only nine players to its opponent’s 19.
“There are obviously costs to having such a small roster—everyone has to be on their game all the time, but having such a small, tight group of guys means we can bond as a team,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “We’ve won all our important games in five, and it shows the difference between us and other teams in those close matches.”
Although the advantages of camaraderie are undeniable, one of those “costs” is the extent to which injuries can affect a depleted staff. 
Two of Harvard’s best players—Weissbourd, its leading offensive force, and fellow senior Jeff Nathan, its libero and defensive specialist—were hurt late last week. 
Weissbourd’s broken finger and Nathan’s sprained ankle won’t keep them out of tonight’s showdown, but the ailments will certainly play a factor.
The injuries have already taken their toll, as evidenced by the Crimson’s disappointing loss to league rival Rutgers-Newark in three sets last Friday. The defeat not only halted Harvard’s run of four straight wins, but also dropped the team into a tie with the Scarlet Pioneers for the division title. 
Rutgers-Newark came out on top in the tie-breaker, allowing it to claim the seventh seed in the league playoffs and making the Crimson the Hay Division runner-up. 
But as all good teams do, the Crimson must quickly shift its mental focus to its next opponent.
“We had a tough loss on Friday,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “We didn’t come in there 100%, which was unfortunate, but we’re not going to dwell on it.”
Overlooking George Mason is something Harvard cannot afford to do.
 Historically strong in the post-season—having reached the EIVA semifinals four times and the finals twice in the past four years—the Patriots should present the Crimson with quite a challenge.
In contrast to its opponent, George Mason finished its regular-season schedule on a high note with a 3-0 win over Tait Division rival NJIT last Saturday. The victory broke a two-game losing streak and brought the Patriots to 6-6 at home. Although the team is below .500 both in overall and conference play, Harvard is well-aware that its appearance on paper may be deceiving.
“George Mason is consistently a very strong team,” Weintraub said. “They have a very strong schedule, so it doesn’t reflect how good they are, but we know they are well rounded, so we can’t be sluggish. But if we come out strong and play Harvard volleyball, I think we have a chance to win.”
The main beneficiary of Weintraub’s passes, Weissbourd, echoed his teammate’s confidence.
“We definitely have a chance,” Weissbourd said. “They are a very beatable team. It’s clear they’re up and down, a streaky team. We just have to come in fired up. We’re going to play our hardest and have fun. I’m confident we can win.”
If Harvard has any hopes of pulling an upset, relying on veteran leadership will be crucial, especially on the offensive side, where the team has struggled of late. 
“The upperclassmen have led us and carried us, starting with Brady,” freshman Matt Jones said. “He’s the go-to hitter—we go to him when it’s crunch time, and Gil runs the offense. Those are the two guys that I think have really been a part of our success, not only with their effort on the court, but they’ve also fostered a good mentality as far as dedication and working hard.”
The winner of tonight’s match will visit No. 4 seed Springfield Saturday, vying for the chance to enter the league semifinals April 30 at Penn State.

Best of this weekend's house list appeals:
"Would anybody be willing to trade a Petraeus ticket for a Dalai Lama ticket?"
Which raises many interesting questions for us here at FlyBy, including: what is the Harvard black market ticket value of  General David Petraeus versus the Dalai Lama?

When MP3s and posters just aren’t enough to satisfy your obsession with Chester French, you can now get an extra dose of the duo by buying a special package in honor of the release of their debut album, “Love the Future.”
If the $7.99 download of the album leaves you hankering for more, D.A. Wallach ’07 and Maxwell C. Drummey ’07 are now offering especially devoted (and moneyed) fans the opportunity to buy their companionship in the form of gym trips, slumber parties, and African safaris. More details after the jump.
Chester French is also marketing its upbeat songs as great running music, and with the $250 “Endurance Package,” you can listen to them live while you hit the treadmill. The package—which includes weight-lifting, 2-on-2 basketball, and Gatorade and Clif bars with the band members—just might make the prospect of hitting the gym appealing.
If you seek even more up close and personal with D.A. and Maxwell via pillow fights and nail painting, you can do so by shelling out $874.36 for the “Slumber Party Package.” Judging from the spare change listed in the price of the package—which includes a homemade breakfast and ukulele serenade—the duo has meticulously computed the cost of their company (or perhaps is just employing the concept of psychological pricing from their days in Ec10).
Based on the description on the band’s Web site, however, there might be some hidden costs involved:
"When Chester French is in      town for a gig they will sleep over at your house. You must provide      sleeping bags and cartoon-themed pillowcases."
But the capstone of the band's album promotion has got to be the $75,000 "African Safari with Chester French and a friend of your choosing" (though FlyBy can only puzzle over why anyone would want a pesky friend tagging along and diluting Wallach and Drummery’s attention). Whereas zealous fans are capped at buying five of the other packages, there is no purchasing limit to this package. Meaning that you can technically spend the rest of your life bushwalking, rhino tracking, and gazing into Serengeti sunsets in the company of D.A. and Maxwell.

Rumors are swirling about the Undergraduate Council’s proposed plan to purchase 45 Mount Auburn Street from its current owners. The plan calls for raising funds over the next several years, including $600,000 for the down payment by next fall, and has caused quite some controversy within the UC. In an email over the UC List, Josh J. Nuni '10 declared that the UC has "come to a point where we have to make a decision—and the decision we make will reveal our values and define our identity." Another UC member, Amanda Lu '11 responded to Nuni saying, "I would like to be able to disagree with what I find to be beneficial to my constituents without being called a tyrant." Before the claws come out any further, FlyBy decided to take a closer look at what the property in contention has to offer.  Take a gander after the jump.
