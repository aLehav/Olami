After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Missed the Beanpot action last year?
You can make up for it this year—the Harvard Athletics ticket office is currently selling presale tickets for the 59th annual tourney between the BU, Harvard, BC, and Northeastern hockey teams.
Monday, Feb. 7 kicks off the action in the TD Banknorth Garden when the Crimson faces the Huskies at 5:00 p.m., and the Eagles-Bulldogs matchup will follow at eight. The following Monday, the championship and consolation matches will wrap up the tournament.
Last year, the women’s squad nabbed its 13th Beanpot title after toppling Northeastern in a close 1-0 victory. The men didn’t have as much luck—they were blanked, 6-0, at the hands of BC, and the consolation match versus the Huskies handed the crew a 4-1 loss.
The matchups will undoubtedly be a focus for the squads, then, as the women look for a repeat and the men seek to bounce back from a disappointing 2010 showing.
If you’re not yet sure if Beanpot action is in your future, tickets will go on sale to the public on Jan. 11. But if you are, call the Harvard Athletic Ticket Office at 617-495-2211 before tickets run out!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no question it’s been a breakout season for Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05. From 2005-2009, the former Ivy League Player of the Year passed for 4,104 yards and tallied 21 touchdown passes in 28 NFL games. This year, in just 11 contests, he’s already thrown for 2,526 yards and matched his previous career total for TD’s against just 11 interceptions. The former Crimson star’s passer rating (85.0) is by far the highest of his career, and, like he did in college, Fitzpatrick is making a difference on the ground, averaging 21.5 rushing yards a game.
Fitzpatrick, rated by the Sporting News as the fifth smartest player in sports (Matt Birk ’98 finished sixth), has also helped a pretty awful Bills team to three wins.
And people are noticing. Yahoo! sports called him “the best NFL QB for the buck,” given his modest pro salary of three million dollars, and The New York Times intimated that he could be a franchise player.
But things aren’t as cheery for Fitzpatrick as they might seem. Since Buffalo holds the fourth-worst record in the NFL, it should be in good position to pick a top quarterback from a 2011 draft class that could include Heisman winner Cam Newton and Heisman finalist Andrew Luck. If the Bills invest in such a high-profile signal caller—one who will command top-five money that makes Fitzpatrick's deal look like chump change—it will leave the Crimson alum where he found himself at the beginning of this year: on the bench.
