“Shake me back into this world / the daydreams are over,” sings Dutch singer-songwriter Floor Jansen in her new single “Daydream,” taken from her upcoming debut album “Paragon.” The song portrays the isolation many felt during the Covid-19 pandemic and compares this loneliness to a daydream in which nothing is tangible. The track then slowly turns into a rock ballad, offering an ode to the power of music to awaken us and connect us with others and with ourselves. Its lyrical complexities and dynamic instrumentals artfully explore themes of seclusion and hope.
“This song is very personal to me, as it was written during the pandemic lockdown when I felt like I had lost track of myself,” Jansen stated in the description of the song’s YouTube video. The lead singer of the acclaimed Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish debuted as a solo artist in 2020, and many of the songs she has released since then touch on the desire to regain a zest for life amidst the numbing days of the pandemic. Though Covid lies in the background of these songs, feelings of losing one’s sense of self are certainly not limited to this time period.
The song starts with a delicate piano instrumental and a set of questions which underscore the fragility of the song’s first half: “Do you see me when you close your eyes? / Do you hear me when the noise dies out? / Do you feel me when the silence hits all the walls built around you?” Jansen depicts isolation as a disorienting numbness of the senses or an overwhelming silence.
Throughout the song, the identities of the speaker and listener are ambiguous. It is possible that the pre-pandemic Jansen is singing to her present self in the first part of the song: “Everything I say and do can't touch you / Everything I am and feel can’t reach you / A daydream from a time went by.” The feeling of unbridgeable isolation and numbness is illustrated through the metaphor of a daydream, sonically underscored by echo and reverb, as well as breathy vocals.
The instrumentation fades, essentially abandoning Jansen, who sings in her stunning, quivering head voice, “Do you hear that? / Do you hear me? / Do you hear me, my voice?” Strings join a subsequent repetition of these lyrics, resulting in an almost otherworldly atmosphere in which a Jansen “from a time went by” hopes to save and reconnect with herself in the present moment.
The pandemic must have been particularly challenging for a musician like Jansen, who lost the opportunity to perform live, thereby taking away a significant part of her identity. But even though she can’t “hear” anything around her anymore, the voice as an inherent instrument ultimately saves her from the engulfing silence, because it connects her internal reality with the external world.
As the song continues, it slowly grows more confident, and the addition of percussion and an electric guitar coincides with a shift in melody and tone. In her powerful chest voice, Jansen sings, “Wake me / I was lost inside my heart / Wake me / It’s over / Wake me / Shake me back into this world / The daydreams are over.” The lyrical shift from questions to declarative statements marks a change in character, as present Jansen expresses her desire to wake up from the daydreams and memories of the better past to finally live again in “this world.”
After a short moment of doubt — “Do you hear me?” she sings — where her fragile head voice and the dream-space returns, the song charges right back into its powerful rock motif, this time adding even more instrumentation. Although the tempo doesn’t change much, the song feels much faster now due to the percussion, vocal riffs, and variations on the melody in a higher register. Similarly, even though one hears the same lyrics (“Wake me” and “Do you hear me?”), the bold, hopeful tone seems to have shifted their intended audience to Jansen’s listeners.
While her voice first let her find a way back to herself, she is now able to pass on this energy and comfort to her listeners. The heart-warming comments on the song’s YouTube video confirm that she has indeed reached her fans with the remedial power of her voice and artistry: “We hear you, Floor!”

On March 5, Weyes Blood, also known as Natalie Mering, performed an ethereal concert bolstered by compelling visual and political components. Roadrunner in Boston was filled with excited people in front of the stage, and Blood’s captivating voice and calming presence made the experience feel expansive.
Evoking a vaguely ritualistic setting, Blood’s bandmates arrived on stage first, surrounded by golden candelabras and rosy light. After they began playing their instruments, Blood entered the stage and began singing “It’s Not Just Me, It’s Everybody” from her latest album “And In the Darkness, Hearts Aglow.” The song is an ode to collective suffering as a result of “overwhelming changes” and isolation. As she sing: “we’ve all become strangers.”
Though Blood consistently remained in one vocal range, her voice possessed an exceptional tone. The instruments perfectly molded to her vocals, crafting a luscious auditory experience derived from sonic wholeness. Blood appeared to sing effortlessly as she glided across the stage.
Reflecting the theme of transience, the spotlights changed color from song to song. Each piece seemed to have a corresponding color. Blood’s white dress displayed whatever was projected onto its material. During her performance of “Movies,” from her 2019 breakout album “Titanic Rising,” a blue-green watery image swam across her dress. Towards the end of her set, Blood turned on a light that shone through the same dress from the center of her chest that illuminated the shape of a heart, illustrating the title of her album “Hearts Aglow.”
During her performance of “God Turn Me Into a Flower,” a documentary-style music video created for the song by filmmaker Adam Curtis was projected behind her. The video followed a loose, experimental structure that alternated between suburban, utopic footage of white people in groups and scenes of police brutality inflicted against people of color. Curtis’s film seemed to respond to the lyric in the opening verse of the song “As long as I stand / to face the crowd … it’s good to be soft when they push you down.” By displaying this video during the concert, Blood’s attention to the visual medium allowed the music to take on new meaning.
Although not super conversational during the performance, Blood often made short remarks that tied into the next song or offered a glimpse into her personality. Her longest aside was about how she does not believe in astrology and that everyone should be free to choose who they want to be. This remark related to the overall lust for freedom inherent in “And In the Darkness, Hearts Aglow,” a craving which is especially apparent in the song “Children of the Empire.” The last lines of this song embody this desire for self-liberation: “We know we’re not free even though / we wanna be free.”
Blood sat down at the piano for “Everyday,” off the “Titanic Rising” album. Though her songs often follow a slower tempo, her song “Everyday” has a bouncier, lighter feel. Even at the bench, Blood got the audience moving during this moment of levity. Her live performance had a very emotive quality, indicative by this shift in the overall mood. Whereas the rest of the songs lulled the audience into a hypnotic reverence, “Everyday” brought a new energy to the swaying crowd.
Bolstered by a strong visual compliment, Blood facilitated a celestial and at times ghostly artistic journey with her musical talent throughout her performance.

For Cody Ko, energy is everything.
In the early morning, he reaches for his camera, recording himself as he makes subpar oatmeal — which he affectionately calls “b’doats”— and slaps on his baseball cap that reads “Energy is Everything.” Then, he trains. Whether running dozens of miles, spending hours on the bike, or swimming along the California coast before sunrise, Cody Ko trains for his next endurance challenge nearly every day and vlogs while doing it, uploading videos to his newest YouTube channel: “Cody Trains.”
Cody Kolodziejzyk — known to his fans as Cody Ko — is a media professional, with popular podcasts and YouTube channels that regularly garner millions of views. His newest venture veers away from his typical comedic reaction videos and music content, instead focusing on amateur endurance training. Ko started training about a year ago.
“I was in a super bad rut,” said Ko in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “I've always been a pretty optimistic and happy person, and I just hadn't felt like that for a long time.” Ko was a D1 college diver at Duke University and grew up in a family full of athletes. “I used to watch my family do all sorts of incredible endurance feats. And I realized I'd kind of lost that part of my life.”
His response was to sign up for a 60-kilometer ultramarathon, beginning a pattern of endurance training that he has maintained consistently since.
“I feel like I kind of found myself again,” said Ko, grinning. “It wasn't just specifically going out and running, it was more about being able to trust myself again, that I'd actually show up for myself and complete these workouts and finish something difficult.”
Ko completed the challenging ultramarathon in August of 2022 and uploaded a video about his journey to his main YouTube channel, which resonated strongly with his viewers.
“In the comments, people were saying, ‘this encouraged me to start running,’ or ‘I had never done anything before, but I got off the couch and I went outside for a walk,’” said Ko. “I go back and watch that ultramarathon video sometimes, just to see how I was feeling, and to remind myself what effect that had on my life.”
Energized by the success of his ultramarathon video, Ko started his separate “Cody Trains” channel in September of 2022. His content embraces imperfection and even failure as it follows his newest training adventure: preparing for an upcoming Ironman race. Whether by vlogging the painstaking process of assembling a stationary bike, telling his fans about his injuries, or even making a full breakfast only to acknowledge that it doesn’t even taste good, Ko doesn’t hesitate to paint a picture of the realistic, and even humorous, struggles of endurance training.
“A lot of the reason why people don't start doing things is just that intimidating part of the learning curve where you don't know anything,” said Ko. “So I think it's important to show that sort of thing.” For Ko, the most troubling learning curve has been cycling.
“I don't understand bikes; they seem really intimidating. There's so many moving pieces,” he said, sighing. “Like, I want to focus on my job. I don't want to sit down and screw something in for an hour trying to figure out how a bike works.”
However, Ko has persisted in his Ironman training, weathering bike maintenance, injuries, and other challenges as his fans cheer him on from his comment section.
“Nothing is consistently, linearly up,” reflected Ko. “I've learned to deal with that with this career especially; it’s peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys.”
By confronting challenges head-on with his channel, Ko has inspired his viewers to do the same. His comments are flooded with positive reinforcement — not only for himself, but for other members of his community. This positive community even reached Ko in person.
“When I was in Palm Desert for my wedding, I went for breakfast with my wife Kelsey,” said Ko. “And we bumped into a girl who told me, ‘I watch your “Cody Trains” videos, and it’s changed my life. My brother, who is severely depressed and hasn't gotten out of bed in months, is now getting up every morning and training because of your videos.’” Ko paused. “Kelsey and I just started crying because that's the nicest thing I've ever heard. That just makes me want to go harder and keep doing this sort of stuff.”
“Cody Trains” is more than inspirational: It’s funny. Ko injects humor and running jokes into every aspect of his videos. For instance, his now-classic tagline “energy is everything” came from an old hat he found abandoned in his house.
“I thought the phrase was pretty corny, and who left his hat here? It’s not mine,” laughed Ko. “But then I just started saying it. And now it’s become this thing that ties the channel together.”
Although the blend of humor and motivation is intentional, it is also natural for Ko, who is experienced in the digital media landscape.
“By now, when I pull out a camera, it's kind of second nature to try and be a little bit performative,” said Ko. “I'm only really vlogging maybe three minutes a day, so it’s not a lot to try to think of a funny joke in there. That's what I've always tried to do in my content – make people laugh.”
Ko believes his infectious energy for endurance training applies to more than just the Ironman.
“A lot of the stuff that I talk about around showing up for yourself every day, people think that's specific to just working out,” he said. “But you can apply this to anything else in your life.”
Ko then delivered a piece of advice directly to his readers and fans who may be starting to build motivation for projects of their own.
“You’ll notice that it’s a compounding thing. You start getting better faster and faster, and you start having more fun, and then it's a snowball,” said Ko. “That’s the advice I would give. Pick something you want to get better at and just do it a little bit every day.”

If the exceptional ratings for HBO’s “The Last of Us” are anything to go by, viewers have latched onto this rendition of Naughty Dog’s 2013 game. As far as video game adaptations go, few compare: Most episodes in this series have received critical and popular acclaim for incredible performances and sharp writing. While HBO’s prestige television treatment introduces the narrative of “The Last of Us” to a wider audience, the video game itself achieved something the show cannot: players’ personal investments. Critics should recognize this unique ability of video games to place the audience directly into the characters’ narratives, especially as a way to elevate the entire artistic experience.
Historically, video games have not been considered of the same artistic caliber as their film or television counterparts. Film critic Roger Ebert was well-known for maintaining video games were not art. Truthfully, in some cases the creative team behind a game aims to do nothing more than entertain. While talented artists often help to realize their vision, these titles offer little more than a fun competition or way to burn time — think “Mario Kart” or “Pong.”
Perhaps Ebert was correct that these games may not be art. He was wrong, however, in identifying player choice as a flaw for all video game stories. In fact, the interactivity of video games often enhances their creators’ goals. For example, “Marvel’s Spider-Man,” from Insomniac Games, forces the player to manage several competing stories. With numerous villains running amok, Peter Parker struggles to help his aunt, support his girlfriend, and manage his role as a hero. This balancing act aligns the hero’s challenges with the player’s, distilling Spider-Man’s all-consuming duties into the mechanics of the game. When Peter is forced to let go of one of those threads, the player is forced to let go too — along with the hours they have invested.
This type of mirroring effect allows players to experience these feelings alongside the characters. Gamers become an actor in the world of the game, rather than an observer. When the plot threatens the playable character, it threatens the player themself — an experience television and film can never replicate. For as much tension HBO’s “The Last of Us” can create for its viewer, it will never acquire the same immediacy for its player — and by extension Joel and Ellie — as the original game does. For many games, these moments of danger themselves are carefully plotted; authorial intent oozes through in pacing, characterization, and worldbuilding.
Unshackled from the primitive technologies of early consoles, modern video games often set out to guide players through a carefully crafted narrative experience. From AAA titles like “God of War: Ragnarök” to indie darlings like “Firewatch,” developers offer stories reflecting human anxieties and hopes, just as television and film do. Yet, video games create scenarios by which player engagement elicits these feelings. Only through player investment in the game world can these stories continue — a deliberate choice made by game designers.
Adapting video games to the screen, however faithful and well-funded, removes a major part of the game developers’ authorial intentions. While HBO’s “The Last of Us” has navigated this by bringing aboard Neil Druckmann, one of the game’s writers, to guide the plot, the show’s story should not be elevated above the game’s own artistic merit. Instead, viewers and critics alike should recognize the important storytelling contributions video games themselves can make to the existing media landscape by including the player directly into the narrative — and enjoy whatever new stories spin out of them.

With a unique blend of influences and a penchant for storytelling, Chyna Streetz is quickly becoming one of the top names in New York City hip-hop. Streetz is known for her fierce lyricism, frequent collaborations with Griselda rapper Rome Streetz, and a distinct style that melds traditional East Coast hip-hop with a modern flair. Born and raised in New York City, Chyna Streetz has carved out a unique lane for herself in the crowded, male-dominated rap game.
Growing up in a family of musicians, Streetz showed a natural talent for music at a young age, and began performing on stage when she was just four years old. However, the rapper’s musical journey began in earnest with a rap battle victory that proved her prowess in the genre.
“It was a battle between me and a boy in the lunchroom over music,” Chyna Streetz said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “We were arguing over different artists and who was better. And then he was like, ‘I'm a better rapper than you,’ and I was like, ‘You can never be better than me.’”
This pivotal moment not only boosted her confidence, but also set her on a path toward creating her own unique sound. “I wound up winning and I realized that I could really do this rap shit,” she added.
In 2018, Streetz released her first EP, "Weird Girl Antics.” The project showcases her unique style and ability to blend elements of classic hip-hop and R&B into a cohesive sound. “The process of putting that [album] together was comprised of all of my life journeys at that moment, like I was dealing with a lot of weird shit. So I was just like, ‘Yeah this is some Weird Girl Antics.’”
Drawing inspiration from a diverse range of artists such as Lil' Kim, Salt-N-Pepa, Lauryn Hill, Missy Elliott, and Janet Jackson, Chyna Streetz's music is a melting pot of styles and sounds. Embracing a combination of Lauryn Hill's poetic expression and Lil' Kim's unapologetic fierceness, Streetz has managed to create a distinct persona that sets her apart from her contemporaries and inspirations alike.
Over the years, Streetz has honed her creative process, focusing on conceptual storytelling and structuring her projects in relation to one another. On recent releases like her EP “Hourglass” from last May, each song is carefully crafted to evoke emotions and tell a story that captivates her audience, like on standout track “Ghetto Diva.” This attention to detail and her passion for creating music that is meant to be felt has set her apart in an industry often criticized for its monotony.
“All my projects have a concept to them,” Streetz said. “I attack them like chapters in a book. How do I want this chapter to look? How do I want this chapter to sound? How do I want this chapter to translate? What do I want [listeners] to know? What don't I want them to know?”
A common thread in Streetz’s music is her unflinching honesty and willingness to tackle tough subjects. Her lyrics often touch on themes of struggle, survival, and perseverance, reflecting her own experiences as a young woman navigating the often hostile world of hip-hop. In addition to her solo work, the rapper is closely associated with Rome Streetz, with whom she shares part of her rap name.
“Rome Streetz was like, ‘Why don't you change your name to Chyna Streetz?’ because Chyna Streetz was my Facebook alias [in 2010],” the rapper said. “It was just supposed to be for Facebook. I changed it to that and then started rapping under that name because everybody was trying to book me with my Facebook name.”
As a woman in a male-dominated industry, Chyna Streetz admits that navigating the rap scene can be challenging. Often underestimated because of her appearance, Streetz has learned to take these misconceptions in stride, proving her ferocity and talent through her powerful performances. She is set to headline a show in New York City with Vel Nine on March 25th. It will be one of Streetz’s biggest solo performances to date.
“They moreso approach me for my look,” the rapper said. “Because I have a real dainty look about me, they don't really take me as the ferocious rapper that I am. And then when I actually perform, it's like ‘Holy shit, who is this?’”

Fatima Ali made waves as a standout chef on Chopped and Top Chef before her rising culinary career was cut short by sarcoma. Her memoir, “Savor,” co-authored with Tarajia Morrell, traces her life before her rise to stardom and even before she was born, weaving in essays from both herself and her mother. As a result, even though the memoir centers on Ali’s perspective, she also uses her writing to examine Pakistani culture, queerness, religion, sexuality, trauma, and family through the eyes of both herself and her mother.
The voice and space given to Ali’s mother, Farezeh, stands out immediately in this memoir. Farezeh speaks at length about the small family in Pakistan Ali was born into and the intricacies of moving between countries and navigating a difficult divorce. When viewed alongside Ali’s own reflections on her childhood, this double perspective creates connections and contrasts that enrich the voices of both women.
At the end of the fifth chapter of her book, Ali presents a lyrical romanticization of her childhood, reflecting that “even the dark was only momentary, with the blackness interrupted by a star, a lantern, or a dream.” However, the writing soon cuts to Farezeh’s weary, matter of fact tone as she describes the breakdown of her marriage. Her more adult perspective highlights both the precious joy and unfortunate naivety of Ali’s childhood perspective.
This style of writing continues to allow for a secondary perspective absent in most memoirs. When Ali comes out to Farezeh, readers can gain insight into how Farezeh saw Ali’s sexuality as “a gaping void Ali was trying to fill” that could be “intimately undone by gossip,” giving Farezeh’s initial apprehension an emotional depth. As a result of showcasing both voices, the reader is able to understand the situation in a more nuanced way, even though the episode may feel as though it were presented from a more detached point of view than would be the case if only a single perspective were presented.
It is remarkable that even as chapters shift between Ali and Farezeh, the disjointed essays still remain undeniably compelling and connected. This is in part due to the raw honesty that raises the emotional stakes without ever veering into melodrama. Farezeh speaks candidly about her failing marriage, her father’s death, and her struggles with immigration, and does not shy away from criticizing parts of her native Pakistani culture. While the discussion of these struggles could easily devolve into a typical story of overcoming all odds, Farezeh humbly tempers her successes with her own admissions of failure, baldly stating, for example, that “liberation was terrifying because I quickly realized that there was a lot I did not know how to do.”
Likewise, looking back on her Chopped victory, Ali admits, “I craved the validation - even from the faceless masses telling me how talented and interesting I was. A predictable reaction to having a detached dad? Probably. Unsurprising from the daughter of a distracted mom? Possibly.”
Even when discussing her battle with cancer, Ali responds to the admiration of others by recognizing that she feels “like a fraud,” stripping away any perceived heroism and emphasizing that she is “just a human being who wants more life.” This keen self-awareness prevents Ali from falling into stereotypical narrative tropes.
Expectedly, a memoir about a chef dedicates significant space to food. However, the moments of this memoir when Ali and Farezeh discuss their experiences with food still manage to stand out. Their luscious prose imbues the memoir with a novelistic quality, while the rich language conveys their deep connections to food. For example, Farezeh describes “fresh pomfret” that “lay as flat and grey” as her “father’s daily newspaper,” adding that it was “as if God had pressed it under his palm.” Slightly disconcerting but undeniably vivid, the language viscerally intertwines her lived experience with her love for food, as evidenced by her keen attentiveness. Just like her mother, speaking to her sensitive palate and intense emotional connection with food, Ali describes the cider she drinks in Spain as “sour like something sweet had decayed […] like a cute little baby with fat cheeks who turns into a total bitch, but there’s still something sweet about her.” Partly humorous and wildly inventive, the language heaves to convey the experience of food in a way that remains captivating even after several readings. Food is not only something to be consumed or reduced to just its physical sensations — it touches the heart and mind in a more experiential way.
Moving from her childhood in Pakistan to her culinary training in New York and then to her rising career and burgeoning adulthood, the memoir hits its inevitable endpoint: Ali’s death to cancer. The last part of the book differs starkly in tone as Ali’s internal suffering takes center stage. The previous chapters echo throughout this ending as Ali reasons with her limited time. The uniqueness of this memoir lies in the way its ending sneaks up on the readers even when Ali’s death is anticipated.
It is heartbreaking to become so intimately invested in a life that must be cut short. “Savor” never short sells Ali’s potential in light of her battle with cancer. It is precisely this emphasis on all the momentum and energy Ali accumulates but never brings to fruition that makes “Savor” intensely moving. The reader cannot help but fall in love with Ali’s indomitable spirit, relentless ambition, and all that she stands for.

This review contains spoilers for the Season Two Premiere of “Bel-Air.”
It has been one year since the release of the Peacock TV series “Bel-Air,” but only “two weeks, three days, and six hours” since the shocking, cliffhanger ending of the last season. In Season 2, the Banks family seems stronger than ever and, as always, dressed to the nines; yet Will’s absence leaves something missing. The first season did a great job at integrating Will into both the luscious Californian and the Banks family itself, evoking lots of anticipation for his return. Ashley’s (Akira Akbar) upcoming birthday fuels the plot of the premiere, and for her birthday all she wants is for Will to come back (and for people to donate to Black Girls Rock, of course).
For the time being, Will is revealed to be living with Jazz (Jordan L. Jones), who gave him a reality check at the end of season 1, telling him “the key to happiness is staying true to who you are, no matter where you are.” Jazz is first seen this season meditating, which is symbolic of his role as the voice of reason for both Will and his love interest, Hilary Banks (Coco Jones).
Hilary and Jazz's relationship, while absolutely adorable, is uncertain. While in the middle of starting her new “influencer house" with Ivy (Karrueche Tran), Hilary struggles to share both control of the startup and Jazz himself with Ivy.
It is clear that this show has taken liberties with the character of Jazz as he is presented in the original show. Instead of being a source of comic relief and unrequited love from Hilary, Jazz is now a peaceful breath of fresh air and a help to the Banks in many serious situations. Hilary and Jazz present a great depiction of young, Black love, one that ignores their different lives and socioeconomic backgrounds.
When Will is not at Jazz’s place, he is “hooping for money,” which ironically is exactly how he got sent to Bel-Air. Worried about his basketball career, he is looking to be introduced to Doc (Brooklyn McLinn), who could be either a way for Will to get scouted or a source of sinister intentions.
Although Will isn’t living with the Banks, he still attends ritzy Bel-Air Prep with them. Will and Carlton (Olly Sholotan), the “dynamic duo,” have an interesting relationship ahead of them. As they dance together in the car on the way to school, there is a great contrast from the cut throat competition they had with one another last season. Yazmin (Riele Downs) is introduced as president of the school’s Black Student Union, which feels convenient as she has a spark of romance with Carlton, class president, and may be the driving force behind a protest between the union and the school.
There are also hints of a conflict involving a Black teacher, Mrs. Hughes, played by Tatyana Ali ’02, the original Ashley Banks from “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” In the premiere, Ashley receives a special book from Mrs. Hughes, “The Revolution Has Come,” a book by Robyn C. Spencer about the Black Panther Party. Another student can be seen suspiciously looking at this interaction, and in later scenes, Ashley walks in on Mrs. Hughes arguing with two other teachers. Could this be the reason for the protest? This plotline not only has potential to successfully intertwine the storylines of Ashley, Carlton, and Will, which were initially separate, but is also incredibly relevant at a time when the inclusion of Black history into school curricula may appear to be in jeopardy. “Bel-Air” is consistent with its interweaving of social issues affecting the Black community into the plot, while also highlighting the role of young people in attempts to make change.
In the premiere, the viewers also find Viv (Cassandra Freeman) and Phil Banks struggling to re-enter their careers. Phil has trouble navigating the return to his law firm after a failed District Attorney campaign, and Viv struggles to open the door for new Black artists, as she barely has her foot in the door herself. After relationship issues related to Phil’s work life last season, the Banks seem to have bounced back. However, with both of them back at work at the same time, it feels as though these new struggles impose a special burden on their marriage, testing it once again.
The cast is strong, with exciting additions like a guest appearance from Saweetie. This season has a loaded plot, yet the show now has a developed and clear identity outside of the original source material, setting this season up to be a promising and captivating watch.

Ranjit Hoskote’s latest book of poetry, “Icelight,” reflects on the cyclical yet unpredictable nature of life. Throughout the collection, nameless characters navigate a new world during the Neolithic period, examining anxieties of remembrance and regret. Hoskote establishes a tension between the presentness of history and the characters’ awarenesses of time’s passage. The book’s form and atemporal nature interrogate the traditional notion of beginnings and endings. The poems present the points at which we begin and end as connected like the shore of a sea, bridging the gap between time, humanity, and spirituality. Hoskote excels at building an interconnected world that is both richly detailed and universal in its themes and concerns, encouraging a truly introspective reading experience.
Hoskote offers readers a nuanced exploration of memory, legacy, and the human desire to be remembered, simplifying complex themes and inviting readers to reflect on their own relationships to these concepts. The characters explore the ways in which our memories shape our understanding of the world and our place within it. His commitment to exploring legacy is particularly striking in the poem “Apostle.” In this poem, the speaker addresses the “apostle of silence” and asks what legacy he will leave behind, highlighting the human fascination with having a lasting impact on the world.
Hoskote’s poetic prowess shines through in his ability to delve into the intricate concepts of memory, skillfully exploring its layered facets, such as regret. The depth of his exploration is exemplified in the poem “Glover,” where Hoskote uses the metaphor of gloves as “silhouettes of regret” to emphasize the lasting impact that regret can have on our memories. Hoskote’s portrayal of common anxieties and their progression throughout the collection imbues his characters with a sense of relatability and universality, bridging temporal gaps.
“Icelight” also offers a rich exploration of spirituality and its role in human life. One of the most striking examples of this theme can be seen in the poem “Crow Hymn.” In this poem, the speaker performs a ritual in which they call out to an “unknown god.” While the language used in the poem is religious in nature, the speaker does not seem to belong to any particular religious tradition. Rather, the poem intimates that spirituality is a universal human experience that transcends specific religious practices.
Throughout “Icelight,” Hoskote uses the poems’ physical forms to help tell their stories. He plays with spacing, line length, and line count to create a visual narrative that enhances the meaning of the words. In “Torso,” for example, Hoskote uses line indentation to create a sense of fragmentation and dislocation. The poem describes a body that has been abused, and the line indentation mimics the physical damage levied against the body. The broken lines and jagged edges of the poem create a sense of disorientation and unease, mirroring the experience of the body described in the poem. This mirroring of text and experience parallels the larger theme of interconnectedness woven throughout the book.
Hoskote further plays with reader expectations by subverting the traditional use of words and sound. This is notable in the back-to-back poems “Fresco” and “Breath.” “Fresco” is composed of four stanzas alternating between four lines and one line in length. “Breath” follows the same form but abandons the final one-line stanza. This structure creates a sense of uncertainty and emphasis on the premature final line, “I have waited all my life to speak.” The omission of that final line implies that the speaker is still waiting to speak, despite having waited their entire life. The absence of a line creates a sense of unresolved tension, suggesting that the speaker's desire to express themselves will never be fully satisfied. The use of absence in “Breath” reinforces the book's theme of interconnectedness and the idea that life is a continuous and ongoing process. Hoskote’s experimentation with form and structure in these poems is a testament to his dexterity as a poet and his commitment to exploring complex themes in a thought-provoking and engaging way. By subverting traditional techniques and embracing the power of absence, he creates a sense of depth and nuance that is meant to resonate with readers on multiple levels.
The final poem “Return” serves as a fitting conclusion to the book, as it confronts the mortality of the body and the immortality of the spirit, suggesting that there is something beyond physical death to which we return. The title itself restates the idea that beginnings and endings are connected and that the end of one journey marks the beginning of another, providing a sense of closure to the reader, while also leaving them with much to ponder about the cyclical nature of life and death — two states of being forever interconnected.
“Icelight” is a remarkable collection of poetry that offers readers a thought-provoking exploration of universal themes and concerns such as the interconnectedness of people through distances of time and memory. Ultimately, Hoskote’s skillful use of language, structure, and imagery creates a deeply moving reading experience.

Netflix’s docuseries, “Live to Lead” is the spark of inspiration Generation Z needs right now, and a must watch for anyone interested in moving mountains in the realm of social justice. Created in honor of Nelson Mandela and his commitment for battling for real change in the world around us, this work was created by director Geoff Blackwell of New Zealand.
This insightful series takes place over seven episodes, each of which follows a different notable figure in recent history. As the series continues, it becomes clear that one person’s actions and persistence can cause a storm of change in the world.
Influential figures covered by this series range from late Supreme Court Justice and women’s rights activist Ruth Bader Ginsburg to former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. These various leaders are introduced by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan; episodes begin with a memorable clip of the episode’s subject in action supporting their cause, then dive back into the roots of their life stories through interviews or other means of storytelling.
Each episode only lasts a half hour; however, they are so beautifully crafted through engaging plot points and polished video editing that they neither feel too short nor too long. The leaders are so intriguing and well chosen that one may want to rewatch each episode to soak up every piece of knowledge presented. Coming from a variety of backgrounds and professions, the subjects of this series showcase an incredibly diverse array of impacts. There has to be at least one episode in this documentary that speaks to any kind of viewer with any kind of passion.
That being said, these inspiring stories were not always without struggle or hardship, and the interviews place a heavy emphasis on this part of each story, allowing the subject of each episode to share the difficult trials that truly made them who they are.
For example, Ginsburg discusses the unadulterated sexism she faced while trying to land a position at a law firm, even after graduating from Harvard Law School. She also opens up about the anxiety she faced when she asked herself if she could handle taking care of a child, while also being a law student.
Meanwhile, Rugby player and philanthropist Siya Kolsi describes some of the struggles he faced growing up with little food available to him, and emphasized the overwhelming feeling of needing to help South Africa during uncertain times like the recent pandemic.
In another episode, lawyer and activist Albie Sachs recalls his near death experience with a car bomb and being targeted after demanding racial equity in support of Mandela’s mission in ending apartheid in South Africa.
In the show, the leaders were brutally honest about their life paths, and there is something extremely remarkable about both their strength and their willingness to be vulnerable in the public eye. This series emphasizes knowing all the details, which includes the good and the bad, so viewers come away with a complete understanding of these subjects, and how invested they were in their respective missions.
The only aspect missing from this documentary was perhaps an episode on a subject who sparked change while in the role of physician, healthcare worker, or science researcher. All of the leaders highlighted fought for improvements to areas such as abortion rights and climate change; however, healthcare equity was not an area touched by this series.
Overall, “Live to Lead” is perfect for anyone looking for end-of-semester motivation, interested in the history of modern day social activists, or trying to figure out how they want to make a difference in the world we live in today.

Nowadays, evangelical Christianity is not associated with hippie teenagers living in community, singing songs, and searching for meaning in their lives. Yet in the ’60s and ’70s, masses of radical youth — commonly known as “Jesus Freaks” — were doing just that.
The 2023 film “Jesus Revolution,” which came out in theaters on Feb. 24, tells the story of this pivotal moment in American culture, which culminated in 1972 and is often regarded as the greatest spiritual revolution in recent history. Based on the lives of Greg Laurie and Ellen Vaughn (who also wrote the book from which the screenplay is adapted), the film focuses on the true story of these two teenagers, both fighting their own battles and coming to find each other and themselves. It also tracks the unlikely partnership between Conservative pastor Chuck Smith and prophetic hippie Lonnie Frisbee, who are brought together by their shared mission of opening the church to young people.
Though the storyline starts by focusing on the chance meeting of Smith and Lonnie, it slowly morphs into a gradual love story between Laurie and Vaughn. In doing so, the film gracefully manages to tie together two plots through a series of converging moments, all of which center around the rapidly growing Calvary Chapel of Southern California.
Rather than using a single event, “Jesus Revolution” uses characters as the vehicles of connection, allowing for smooth transitions; it is teenaged Jeanette Smith who introduces her father Pastor Chuck Smith to Lonnie Frisbee, who resembles Jesus in both appearance and action.
Ultimately, all five of these characters serve as both the transformer and the transformed through the powers of faith in God and connection to each other. This ingenious unfolding of events and the message of the movement match up well, both communicating the message that God works in miraculous, unexpected ways if people are only willing to open their hearts to those around them to see the sanctity in everyone.
The use of water as a central focus of both plot and shot is critical to the nature of the film. Not only does the story both start and end on the sunny beaches of California, but several critical scenes center around water — mirroring how the Jesus Revolution attracted disciples via public baptisms. Whether it be the come-to-Jesus meeting of Laurie and Frisbee in a torrential downpour or the several baptisms in the Pacific Ocean, the cleansing water motif creates a powerful parallel between Biblical Gospel stories and the Jesus Revolution, visually implying that this movement is comparable to a second coming.
However, in addition to the individual moments of internal conflict that several characters are facing, the film portrays the weaknesses of the church's rapid growth, placing special focus on the rifts this creates between individuals. Though the film ultimately ends on the idea that the movement is bigger than any one individual, it leaves some key conflicts unresolved, making the end feel narrow and somewhat abrupt; for example, the split between Smith and Frisbee is only resolved via information shown before the film’s credits, which viewers are likely to find unsatisfying.
Similarly, the film fails to properly develop the character of the plot’s catalyst, Jeanette Smith. Viewers may be left feeling frustrated by her slowly fading presence and the lack of recognition she is given.
Despite these flaws, it is fair to say that it was incredibly well-executed and original, as it powerfully tells the undertold story of this counterculture movement. The soundtrack, warm camera filter, and wardrobe immerse audience members in the time period, allowing viewers to get swept away in the story. Tangentially, the interweaving storyline does an excellent job of keeping the audience engaged through its several individual moments of climax, perspective shift, and semi-plot twists. Though the acting is sub-par at times, it is easy to ignore because these cinematic elements of the film are well done.
However, it is crucial to note that Greg Laurie has become increasingly controversial in recent years, spreading hateful messages about the LGBTQ+ community through his church, the Harvest Christian Fellowship. Though the film focuses on the liberating nature of the movement he became involved with in his youth, his contemporary views are in direct contradiction with the highly welcoming mission of the movement as portrayed in the film.
When the context of Laurie’s present-day beliefs are taken into account, it becomes hard to fully enjoy the movie; given that it is based off of his memoir, the storyline largely portrays his character as the lovable protagonist, which may leave viewers feeling frustrated and conflicted.
Therefore, when taking into consideration both the work and its subject, the film lands in the middle of the road. Captivating and well made but with an exigently flawed subject, the film presents a serious conflict between its message of making Christianity accessible to youth and the reality of what the movement’s modern legacy is, which is highly likely to be the viewer’s overall takeaway.

If any readers remain uncertain as to whether personal challenges inspire the best art, Maggie Smith’s “You Could Make This Place Beautiful” may win some over. In her latest book, Smith — poet by trade, memoirist by necessity — covers lots of ground. Best known for her 2016 poem “Good Bones” — a work that continues to go semi-viral on social media in moments of national mourning — her memoir, “You Could Make This Place Beautiful,” renders her more vulnerable than any poem ever could. Smith walks readers through her marriage and the birth of her two children, reveals the behind-the-scenes of her successful creative career, and details her emotionally and logistically painful divorce.
Due to her celebrated poetry prowess, it’s no surprise that Smith is an excellent writer. While an autobiography may not seem like the natural choice for someone who has dedicated their life to mastering a different literary form, Smith takes to the genre with exceptional ease. Her poetic capacity to succinctly capture and convey her emotions combined with an ability to deepen the bond with her audience allows her voice to shine through.
“You Could Make This Place Beautiful” is beautiful precisely because it luxuriates in the complicated and painful emotions that Smith has spent her career encapsulating in verse. The chapters are numerous and short — some are less than one page, and their writing styles vary, yet they still allow for more unrestrained personal expression than most poetry.
Smith goes to great lengths to clarify that her memoir is solely her side of the story; she never purports to know what it felt like to be on the other side, to understand her ex-husband’s emotions or decisions. While the particularities of her divorce are written in painstaking detail, there is a clear purpose for each word, as these experiences come with valuable lessons to learn. Readers learn of the importance of not relying on a spouse, financially or emotionally, or the significance of shielding children from the realities of a divorce. But most importantly, Smith reminds us that children always know more than adults think they do.
A highlight of this work is the overwhelming sense that both Smith and the trajectory of her marriage is relatable: The silent, growing resentment, the erratic fits of rage, the futile attempts to salvage a connection that was lost long ago — all of it reads as though it could, in theory, happen to anyone. Otherwise happy marriages can and do buckle under the stresses of an unequal parenting partnership or unfair work expectations. In this way, the book acts as a warning to readers. The overarching lesson of the book may be to simply let the natural changes of life happen, even while acknowledging the extraordinary pain of those changes.
This book offers a wide array of interpretations depending on the reader. Divorced adults may take solace in Smith’s ability to find joy and independence in her post-marriage life. Mothers may find the discussions of Smith’s parenthood anxieties — the same ones that led to the writing of “Good Bones” all those years ago — to be extremely cathartic. Younger readers may learn the importance of choosing a partner carefully, and that forever is never guaranteed.
“You Could Make This Place Beautiful” is a testament to the power of vulnerability. Smith’s words, once again, will bring comfort to many simply by showing readers that they are not alone, and that navigating this world is hard. Smith does so in a way that is exceptionally incisive and authentic, leading to nothing less than an exceptional reading experience.

Massachusetts-bred producer MichaelAngelo has made a name for himself in the East Coast underground, working with an array of talented artists and finding inspiration from his travels. His beats have graced projects from the likes of Griselda Records, Estee Nack, BoriRock, Eto, and many more. He is also closely associated with Manteca, a label collective led by rappers CRIMEAPPLE, Primo Profit, and RLX. With an ear for catchy sample loops and an expert eye for up-and-coming talent, MichaelAngelo has distinguished himself as one of the top beat-makers to coming out of the Northeast.
The producer has been making beats for years, but his MichaelAngelo alias emerged from a recent rebrand. “When I used to go off a different producer name, the name of the game was to try to work with everyone in the city. It didn’t necessarily water my stuff down, but it kind of watered down the need for it. So when I rebranded, I made a decision that I'm only going to work with artists that I want to work with,” MichaelAngelo said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
MichaelAngelo's love for music began in his childhood. His brothers exposed him to hip-hop artists N.W.A., Public Enemy, and Wu-Tang Clan, which played an essential role in shaping his early music preferences. The producer’s recent work includes full length projects from each of the members of Manteca as well as with rappers like BoriRock and Eto. His process begins with a sample or a melody that catches his ear and builds from there.
“As far as making beats, I dig and find a bunch of samples,” MichaelAngelo said. “Then, I go back to them and chop them. I chop pieces that I like, and compile a good selection, so when I sit down and make the beats I have something to keep going off of. It’s like a pre-cut library.”
As an independent artist, MichaelAngelo credits his learning experiences to trial and error, experimenting with different sounds, and constantly adapting to the ever-evolving musical landscape. He emphasizes the importance of genuine connections and friendships with the artists he collaborates with, as they contribute to the authenticity of his work.
“When I moved to Salem, I didn't know anyone,” MichaelAngelo said. “I found out there was a group called Tragic Allies and just saw what they did. I would build with group member Estee Nack and did tracks with him early on. Another kid I knew ran some community-type hip-hop stuff, and he threw al.divino on one of my beats when he was just 17 and I was like ‘Yo, this dude's got a crazy ass voice,’ so I linked up with him. I actually introduced al.divino and Nack for the first time. I have a picture that I'm gonna release as part of the rollout for a project I got with [al.divino].”
“Estee Nack, al.divino, and Primo Profit, I've known all three of them for over 15 years or so,” the producer added. “It's great to see all of us coming up right now.”
MichaelAngelo's journey in the music industry has taken him to numerous locations worldwide while on tour with Manteca, including Europe and Colombia. He recently returned from an international tour with CRIMEAPPLE, which included stops in Austria, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. The producer’s travels have influenced his perspective on life and his creative process. As Manteca’s go-to producer, MichaelAngelo shared that traveling and touring with the group has only improved their musical collaborations.
“[Manteca] is a family,” the producer said. “It's more than a label. You'll see a lot of these labels out here and they might not rock with each other. They might be on the same label, but do they travel with each other? You don't see too much of that. I think it plays out a lot in the music too.”
“When I was in Amsterdam, I had fans walk up to me,” he added. “They were like, ‘I love RLX and I love Primo's stuff. But, when y’all do some stuff together. It's just different.’ And I told them that that's my job as a producer. These are my friends. It’s more than just music.”
MichaelAngelo has an exciting year lined up, with multiple projects in the pipeline, including collaborations with al.divino, Primo Profit, CRIMEAPPLE, Elcamino, and many more. “When I was chasing this dream, I was working construction my whole life,” the producer said. “I remember the point where I was like, ‘Yo, fuck it, I gotta quit.’ I had to quit the construction job because I wasn't getting enough done [with the music] at that time. I knew I was getting flooded with work. So, it was time to put the construction on the back end, focus on the music and really believe in myself.”
Though Boston remains his home base for now, MichaelAngelo has plans of relocating to Los Angeles for a year to explore new opportunities and connections. As he looks to the future, he remains dedicated to his craft, using his passion for music as a form of therapy and self-expression.

Until May 29, Lighthouse Immersive Studios is hosting the exhibition “Disney Animation: Immersive Experience” in downtown Boston at the Lighthouse Artspace at the Saunders Castle, beckoning Disney lovers to surround themselves with Disney hits and nostalgia.
The central attraction of the exhibition is a large room with floor-to-ceiling projection screens, and upon stepping inside, it is easy to feel transported to a different time, with the opening screens evoking a museum space full of various Disney artifacts projected on the screens ranging from the Genie’s lamp in “Aladdin” to Arthur’s sword in “The Sword in the Stone.” The narration opens with Mickey — dressed in his “Fantasia” garb — inviting the audience to “make a wish.” The exhibition is also adorned with benches for visitors to sit on as they watch the animation unfold. Others can choose to rest or even lie on the floor to watch the magic happen.
Unsurprisingly, Disney has a large repertoire of songs to choose from, making it difficult to perfectly curate a setlist that fits the approximately one hour run-time of the exhibition. Given this, Lighthouse Immersive Studios clearly made an attempt to balance both classic Disney songs with those that might fly under the radar, ranging from crowd favorites like “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin” to more obscure choices like “You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly!” from “Peter Pan.” However, it was inevitable that some cult classics would be omitted. For instance, “Reflection” from “Mulan,” and even “Let it Go” from “Frozen” were conspicuously absent.
The exhibition also featured a healthy mix of both classic Disney movies from its Renaissance period and more recent blockbusters. The viral “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” from “Encanto” had an extended feature, with scenes from the movie playing out on the screens, largely unchanged from the original film sequence. The iconic “Circle of Life” from “The Lion King” received similar treatment, though the exhibition made better use of its multiple screens to show the same scene from different perspectives, portraying the animals below the cliff on one screen and a close up of Rafiki lifting Simba on another. The show felt the most effective when the multiple screens were thoroughly utilized.
Though the exhibition was advertised as being interactive and immersive, the potential for audience participation felt squandered. For instance, a bubble machine was situated at the center of the room: During “Show Yourself”, bubbles drifted down before dissolving into smoke midair, and “Poor Unfortunate Souls” from “The Little Mermaid” featured the same effect as montages of Disney villains played. Though this interactive element was exciting, the songs could have been better chosen to fully capitalize on the functionality of the bubble machine: “Under The Sea,'' also from “The Little Mermaid,” felt like a much more natural and obvious choice, or even “Shiny” from “Moana.”
Beyond the bubble machine, there were certain songs where further props or interactive elements felt lacking. Midway through the show, “I See The Light” from “Tangled” played on the screens, accompanied with scenes of Rapunzel transfixed by the floating lanterns during the enchanting scene. It felt like a sorely missed opportunity to either provide the audience with their own lanterns or include some sort of prop — perhaps confetti or lights — to add further three-dimensionality to the experience.
Nevertheless, the show was both well-paced and effectively planned, creating a narrative arc that added emotional intensity. Beyond the nostalgia of listening to Disney’s greatest hits, there was a clear choice in the sequencing of songs; in particular, the conflict in a traditional Disney movie was substituted with an extended scene from “Moana” of the heroine giving up on her journey to restore the Heart of Te Fiti before deciding to keep going. Though an unexpected choice given the wealth of powerful second act anthems that Disney has — such as “The Next Right Thing” from “Frozen II” or “Hakuna Matata” from “The Lion King” — it worked surprisingly well in providing an emotional core to the exhibition. Such a choice prevented the show from being merely a montage of Disney nostalgia, but rather, a celebration of the triumph and determination of these Disney characters.
Ultimately, the immersive experience promises to be a fun and relaxing night out, comparable to an upgraded version of a drive-in movie. Though the interactive and immersive experience of the show did not realize its fullest potential, any Disney-lover looking for a way to relive the magic of these childhood movies will certainly not be disappointed by the experience.
The “Disney Animation: Immersive Experience” runs in The Castle through May 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Poet Danez Smith perched precariously on the arm of a couch, chatting with students before their scheduled reading on March 1. On this chilly Wednesday, students, faculty, and visitors alike poured into the space as the sky outside the windows bruised to night. Even before the reading began, the Barker Center’s Thompson Room hummed with conversation, warm light spilling from the chandeliers.
The excitement only intensified with Harvard Professor of English, Stephanie L. Burt’s, enthusiastic introduction of Smith and their award-winning collections, “Homie” and “Don’t Call Us Dead.” Smith has won the Forward Prize for Best Collection, the Minnesota Book Award in Poetry, the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Poetry, and the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. Besides their achievements, Burt focused on Smith’s searing emotional impact.
“What has reading so much Danez Smith done to me?” Burt asked the audience as she analyzed her favorite Smith poems, including an innovative list poem titled “depression food” which culminates in “consolatory sex.” The emotional appeal that Burt identified — sometimes relatable, sometimes fiercely personal — transformed Smith’s already powerful poems into forces to be reckoned with.
Smith is a poetic innovator, expertly shaping form and altering conventions to fit their purpose. Instead of the typical reading structure, which Smith identified as more like a lecture than a conversation, Smith redefined their reading as a collective, shared experience and encouraged the audience to respond to their works together.
“Poems, for me, are better when there is a sense of connectedness between me and you. I know some of us were trained to wait until the end of the poem to show a sign that you were excited or moved by it, and I don’t like that,” Smith said, even encouraging members of the audience to hold hands. “You can be here together, for a little bit.”
Smith maintained this “sense of connectedness” between author and audience throughout their reading, fueled by their own incessant energy and enthusiasm. Smith’s incredible written work gained a new charge when read aloud, suffused with a pervasive, infectious joy. As Smith read “My President,” the opening poem from “Homie,” their achingly emotional delivery pulled the audience out of their everyday lives and into a world of Smith’s creation, where “the boys outside walgreens selling candy for a possibly fictional basketball team” were their presidents. Smith’s voice was sometimes tender and confessional, while at other times desperate and pulsing with urgency.
Smith’s intense imaginative power allows them to push against the reality we live in. Many of their poems discuss police brutality or gun violence, and navigate the complexities of Smith’s Black and Queer identities. In particular, the poem “how many of us have them?” simultaneously celebrates friendship and mourns the dead, sliding seamlessly from self-deprecating jokes to scraping grief and back again. As Harvard Professor of English and African and African American Studies Tracy K. Smith expressed, Smith’s emotionally expansive poems “move us through many different stages of revelation,” as if each poem is composed of “seasons.”
“the wind is tangled / with the dust of the dead homies, carrying us over / to them, giggling in the mirror. hear them. hear,” Smith read from “how many of us have them?” This heart-wrenching juxtaposition of joyful memory and hollowing grief was made all the more tragic by Smith’s delivery, the repetition of “hear them” both a plea and a promise. Within a single line, Smith channeled both joy and sorrow, grief and hope, love and longing, an inimitable testament to their emotional range.
Smith’s other poems touched on sexuality, race, love, and the body, often collapsing these palimpsestic topics into a single, moving moment. “How many people have somebody in their family that you love but once they’re dead, life might be a little easier? Great, so everybody raised their hand! The queer mixer is next door,” Smith quipped before reading “waiting on you to die so I can be myself.” In “Tonight, in Oakland,” a lover proclaims to Smith, “I want to take you / how the police do, unarmed & sudden.” These stunning lines, coupled with the poem’s wishful, anaphoric litany of “tonight,” laid bare the synergy between grieving racialized violence and celebrating one’s identity.
Victor Terry, an educator from Boston and longtime fan of Smith, particularly connected with Smith’s raw depiction of their Black Queer experience. “I’m in awe of how honest and brave they are,” Terry said. “There aren’t many places I can find a true depiction of a Black Queer person in a male’s body experience, unapologetically.”
Burt also expressed her appreciation for the transformative experience of reading Smith’s restless, ever-shifting poems, especially from an identity that differs from her own.
“I’m super into the micro-pivots that their lines make,” said Burt. “My life experience is really different from theirs, and reading them, I have this experience of, ‘they’re speaking to me, they’re not speaking to me, they’re speaking to someone else,’ and it’s amazing to just be in the room and listen.”
Even while embracing complex emotions, Smith is insistent on remaining hopeful, and shifting the onus of affirming identity away from marginalized communities.
“I do want to argue for a better world, but I don’t need to argue that I matter. I want to move past that,” Smith said, reflecting on their earlier tendency to write as an affirmation of their identity. “It’s unfair to ask any writer or artist to bear the brunt of all the complications of the world. We’ve just got to do our fucking work.”
While they recognized the challenges of writing from — and about — marginalized identities, Smith ended by dwelling once again on poetry’s ability to make the possible tangible, to draw it close.
“The poem’s generosity is its porousness; it can hold so many things that it can be a space of conjuring things into life,” Smith said. “The generosity of the poem is the generosity to continue to dream.”

Intergenerational trauma. Found family. Extremely creative insults. What’s not to like? The Lyric Stage Company of Boston’s production of “The Great Leap,” which ran from Feb. 24 to March 19, brings all of these and more to the basketball court. The play, written by Lauren Yee and directed by Michael Hisamoto, is ultimately a story about how to take control of your own narrative, which asks: What is it like to spend your whole life standing still, and how do you learn to move?
Set in San Francisco in 1989, “The Great Leap” follows Manford Lum, a Chinese American basketball player with a chip on his shoulder; Saul, his cynical white coach; and Wen Chang, a Chinese national coach with a hidden past. Manford manages to get himself a spot on an American basketball team to play a “friendship” game in Beijing, but finds himself caught up in his family history and questioning what it means to be both Chinese and American.
Yee’s script is the backbone of the production, peppered with salaciously out-of-pocket wordplay and buoyant moments of camaraderie. The dialogue is fresh and alive; characters roast each other with delightful wit, only to turn around and say something so sincere it hurts. Yee also pokes fun at the audience's preconceived notions about the sanctity of religion and politics in China — for example, the show is peppered with tongue-in-cheek references to Mao Zedong. A Chinese character will say, seriously, “To quote an old Chinese proverb…” Pause, then finish, “What bullshit!”
Such unexpected turns aren’t just funny; they also make the play feel self-aware of the expectation placed on it — not just to entertain, but to educate. Perhaps in another play, a character would seriously explain an old Chinese proverb to an audience waiting to be praised for watching something educational. However, Yee instead chooses to explore the ideological differences between the two countries, and what it means to be shaped by both, in a funny, nuanced, and ultimately heartbreaking way.
The performances are all strong, with each actor bringing playfulness, nuance, and gravity. But Gary Thomas Ng stands out, bringing a quiet, soft-spoken, yet powerful quality to Wen Chang — a character whose anger and despair are always simmering beneath the surface. These two emotions are hidden so well that the audience almost forgets they are there, until the moments when Ng tactfully brings them out.
While portrayals of Asian masculinity as soft and “feminine” have historically been criticized for being racist and orientalist, Ng’s portrayal of a softer, gentler, yet still forceful masculinity is a subtle, yet important moment for Asian male representation. In contrast to Saul, the brash, in-your-face, hyper-masculine American male coach who’s always yelling or cursing at someone, Ng’s character shows that Asian men don’t have to prove their masculinity by acting like white men. In a story where proving your toughness is inextricably tied to proving your worth as a father or son, this kind of portrayal onstage allows for more expansiveness around what Asian masculinity can look like.
The production’s set design, lighting choices, and the layout of the space heighten the emotions of the play. Seats are arranged against three of the four sides of the stage, making the theater feel more like a stadium than a traditional proscenium. Manford says he wants to “sit courtside” for a close view of history being made. Due to this seating arrangement, the audience feels like they are doing exactly that. The brick walls and wooden floors are designed to make the space feel like a run-down gym: stifling, claustrophobic, familiar. The space reflects Manford’s state of mind — he’s stuck in his hometown and wants to get out, yet always finds himself returning to the basketball court, whether in San Francisco or Beijing.
These design elements come together in a dramatic, almost ethereal flourish at the play’s close. Wen Chang is sitting alone in his sterile apartment in Beijing, looking down on the Tiananmen Square protests. The play’s set lives in the land of realism — real gym benches, real basketballs, hyper-realistic brick walls and windows. However, as Wen Chang prepares to leave his apartment, enter the protests, and face violence and certain death, a door in the middle of the stage swings open — a door that’s been there the whole time, but has never been opened. Golden light glows within it — it’s impossible to tell where it leads. If it even ends, or just keeps going. In a play grounded in the smack of a ball hitting the floor, we feel, for a second, weightless. For a moment, the curtain lifts, and we glimpse the unknown and the unearthly. And then the lights go out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To understand the trend of the 95th annual Academy Awards, we must first go back to the 27th Academy Awards, when Judy Garland, a fading child star, sat in her hospital room. Garland’s new film, “A Star Is Born,” was her last chance to reclaim the spotlight — a task which seemed reachable, as she was not only the favorite to win Best Actress in 1955, but seemed so guaranteed to win that NBC cameras filed into her room to capture the moment. However, another name was read and a new star was born: Grace Kelly. With that, the camera crew left and closed the door of Judy Garland’s major acting career — out with the old and in with the new.
After 68 years, the same trend has seemingly arrived again. Michelle Yeoh, at 60 years old, is one of the oldest actresses in her category, but was again a favorite for best actress. Seated in the first row, with her category being announced by historic winner Halle Berry, auspicious signs presented familiar circumstances, but, this time, the narrative changes: She won. Not out with the old, but not out with the new either.
From the Cocaine Bear to a star-studded rendition of “Happy Birthday,” the 95th annual Academy Awards were full of new surprises — but the greatest part of this year’s honors were the seemingly predictable wins giving way to new representation. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” has been both a critic and fan favorite since its release as a summertime blockbuster. All the major media outlets forecasted its Oscar dominance, but not even the seemingly most certain prediction is guaranteed.
As seen in the dominance of the OscarsSoWhite hashtag over the last decade, the Oscars have a persistent problem with diversity. So when a film with abundant representation is nominated for an Academy Award, it has the potential to go the way of Judy Garland — making all the top ten Oscar snubs lists rather than walking away with the big prize. However, this year’s Oscars allowed “Everything Everywhere All At Once” to fulfill the predictions and make history while doing it.
The success of “Everything Everywhere All At Once”’s success is a win for Asian representation. This is the first time that multiple actors of Asian descent have won in one year, and, of course, Michelle Yeoh’s historic victory makes her the first Asian American actress to ever win Best Actress. While Asian people finally being recognized is the most important accomplishment of the night, something that Yeoh noted in her acceptance speech establishes another evident 2023 Oscar’s thread: The old can never be out.
In her speech, Yeoh said, “Don’t let anyone tell you you are past your prime,” a mantra she and Jamie Lee Curtis have clearly both adhered to. With their wins, the 95th Academy Awards awarded actors who have been working for decades to gain their footing or be respected in the industry.
Moreover, while Michelle Yeoh aimed her directive to the older women in the audience who, like Judy Garland, have consistently been passed over for younger women in Hollywood, Oscars’ night saw men claiming that narrative as well. Ke Huy Quan, a former child actor won best supporting actor, and Brendan Fraser, a since forgotten ’90s heartthrob, made his leap back into prominence by winning best actor for his role in “The Whale,” beating early favorite “Elvis”’s Austin Butler, a comparatively young actor.
The big winner of the night teaches us what success Hollywood can find when it embraces its originality again; but in a world where two of the best picture nominees are sequels and lackluster remakes reign supreme, how can you make a classic into something inventive and relevant? The answer might lay in the second most popular winner of the night, “All Quiet on the Western Front.”
While the film is very different from both its book and the original 1930 production, “All Quiet on the Western Front” deserves its own praise for bringing this story to a modern audience. The original film was a sensation in its time because of its innovative techniques to showcase the horror of war, including the use of sound, but a modern audience watching the original picture with a knowledge of contemporary amenities like visual effects would find it difficult to understand the visceral, shocking nature of the original picture. Thus, the movie’s intention is lost with age. It is for reasons like this that remakes should be considered. While the film does not share many similarities with its original source material, it is a successful example of how modern technology can help recontextualize timely classics for a modern audience.
Overall, the 95th Annual Academy Awards appear to have been the perfect amalgamation of the old and the new. It avenged Judy Garland’s loss by giving old-guard actors waiting for deserved success their wins. It also offered a needed reimagination of a classic Hollywood success. As the Academy nears its 100th year, the appreciation for what has come before and what Hollywood’s past could lend to its future is more important than ever.

Oliver Tree
Fans from far and wide traversed the Eliot Bridge for the first time in three years to attend the three-day Boston Calling Music Festival. Among the highly anticipated acts was Oliver Tree’s iconic performance on the Delta Airlines Blue Stage. The Santa Cruz, Calif., native took to the stage wearing his signature purple-pink windbreaker and blonde wig, surrounded by his band who were similarly dressed to form a trio of Oliver clones. Tree proudly proclaimed that Boston was his favorite place to perform, referencing his March performance at House of Blues. Among some of the songs Tree performed, were “Alien Boy” from his 2020 album “Ugly Is Beautiful” and the 2016 single “When I’m Down'' stood out as most charismatic, getting the crowd fired up for the rest of the sunny day.
HAIM
Boston Calling veteran HAIM warmed up the Green stage in advance of Friday’s headliner. The trio, consisting of sisters Este, Alana, and Danielle Haim worked the crowd with a collection of soft rock tracks off their most recent album, “Women in Music Pt. III.” With songs like “The Steps” and “Gasoline,” HAIM had the audience singing along between impressive musical numbers and a dance break. While HAIM’s studio tracks pull inspiration from indie pop, the band is known for embracing and highlighting rock influences in their live performances. Songs like “My Song 5” and “Up From A Dream” were imbued with heavier instrumentation in their live renditions as each of the sisters rapidly switched between, drums, keys, and guitar. This proved to be a perfect match for the many rock enthusiasts in Boston Calling’s audience.
Rüfüs Du Sol
Friday’s last act to grace the Red Stage was the Australian trio Rüfüs Du Sol. With Tyrone Lindqvist on vocals and guitar, Jon George on the keyboards, and James Hunt on the drums, the EDM house band swathed the Boston crowd in impeccable vibes. With an impressive 90 minute setlist that featured hit songs like “You Were Right” from their 2015 “Bloom” album, Rüfüs lit up Harvard Athletic Complex as the sun went down. Using hallucinogenic strobe lights that distorted and fractured their appearance, they took advantage of the dark sky to put their stage effects to good use.

Kenny Hoopla
With the storm casting the future of Saturday in a dubious light, Kenny Hoopla swept in to save the day. Dressed in a casual fit consisting of a T-shirt, jeans, and converse, Kenny relaxed the crowd and managed to ease the worries of a tumultuous day. Orchestrating a call and response for the chorus of “How will I rest in peace if I’m buried by a highway?” Kenny hyped up the crowd with the promise “I'll give you everything I got if you give me everything you got,” before doing a backflip. The energy intensive performance didn't stop there, as Kenny spent most of his set either crowd surfing or in the photo pit handing out high fives left and right. Overall, he managed to deliver an impressively energetic performance in spite of the pressure of being, in some ways, the first act of the day.
Orville Peck 
“Boston, yeehaw,” Orville Peck said, kicking off performances on the Delta Airlines Blue stage following a rain delay. After having his time cut short due to the weather, the country star made the most of the limited time he had while performing an abbreviated set. Donning his infamous leather fringed mask and a cowboy hat, Peck performed his most popular tracks including “Turn to Hate” and “Dead of Night.” Through a mix of mumbled whispers and boisterous crooning, Peck showed off his unique brand of country rock fusion.
Black Pumas
Led by front man Eric Burton, Black Pumas made a performance to a crowded field of fans feel intimate. Proclaiming his desire to have a conversation rather than a performance, Burton took every opportunity to get closer to the crowd. From repeatedly jumping off stage to pose for photos with the audience, Burton showed his appreciation toward the fans in attendance. While on stage, he found his groove alternating between playing guitar and dancing along as he sang a collection of soulful tracks including “OCT 33” and “Black Moon Rising.” He was joined on stage by the other half of Black Pumas, guitarist Adrian Quesada, and a backing band supporting throughout. Angie Miller and Lauren Cervantes were standouts, harmonizing and grooving while providing backing vocals to complement Burton’s soulful melodies. The band wrapped up the set by performing their Grammy nominated record “Colors” as the audience swayed while singing along.

Japanese Breakfast
Hot off of an appearance as the musical guest on the season finale of SNL, Japanese Breakfast performed to a packed crowd on the Delta Airlines Blue Stage. The Grammy-nominated indie pop band led by vocalist Michelle Zauner dazzled the crowd with her psychedelic vocals and a heavy dose of horns. The band wasted no time, opening with “Paprika” followed by “Be Sweet,” the two biggest hits off of her 2021 project “Jubilee.” As the day grew long under the sweltering sun, attendees enjoyed the set in unique ways, bouncing along to “Everybody Wants to Love You” while resting on inflatable structures scattered at the outskirts of the stage's boundary. With attendees sprawled out over not only the designated stage’s area but the surrounding hills and grass patches, Japanese Breakfast's lo-fi groove was just what attendees needed, leaving them refreshed and rejuvenated for the remainder of the festival.
Peach Tree Rascals
It’s never easy to play the first set of the day at a music festival. It’s even more difficult for a feel good alternative group facing an army of hardcore metalheads camped out in advance of Metallica’s headlining set scheduled to run later in the evening. In spite of these challenges, Peach Tree Rascals, a music collective from San Jose, Calif., won the hearts of even the toughest attendees throughout their set on Sunday. The group was led on stage by vocalists Tarrek Abdel-Khaliq, Joseph Barros, and rapper Isaac Pech, while members Dominic “Dom” Pizano and Jasper Barros supported on keys and guitar. The rambunctious crew worked the crowd through a collection of feel-good songs including “Mango” and “Fumari” as Abdel-Khaliq jumped from the stage to high-five audience members. After a short pause to lead the crowd in a rendition of “Happy Birthday” celebrating Barros, the band closed out the show with their viral hit “Mariposa.”
Glass Animals 
Following Japanese Breakfast, Glass Animals took to the Green stage. The British indie rock band delivered their set smoothly, quenching the afternoon heat with their unique sultry R&B/rock sound. With the background of a basketball hoop, neon “POOL” and “MOON” signage, and flickering palm trees, their stage was as whimsical and serendipitous as their name. The Oxford quartet featured songs from their sophomore album “How to Be a Human Being” like “Pork Soda,” during which Dave Bayley actually held up a pineapple! Singer Dave Bayley sang with passion, his distinctive smooth vocals flooding the Harvard stadium in tropical vibes. They wrapped up the set with their most popular summer anthem “Heat Waves” — fitting for such a sunny day — making the crowd sway to and fro to the lyrics “Heat waves been fakin' me out.”

It’s the 1970s: rock ’n roll, shaggy hair, big dreams. A star is not so much born as hurled into existence — an electrifying powder-keg, held together by passion and genius alone. It explodes, over before it really got going. This is the story of fictional band “Daisy Jones & The Six.”
“Daisy Jones & The Six,” Amazon’s adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s bestselling novel, premiered on March 3. The eponymous band’s music — performed by the show’s actors singing and playing instruments as their characters — was released before the series itself, beginning with singles “Regret Me” and “Look at Us Now (Honeycomb)” and culminating in the album “AURORA” on March 2. Crafted with the help of ’70s music legend Jackson Browne himself and released by Atlantic Records, the pre-series release was the key to a marketing scheme devoted to making the band feel real.
For many lovers of music, the artists’ personal histories are an added source of interest and entertainment. After all, musicians’ love lives are fodder for tabloids. Inspired by the turbulent relationship of Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, “Daisy Jones” is the epitome of this dream where the love lives translate directly to the lyrics. Consequently, its marketing spills fiction into reality, creating a fantasy where the band itself is real and the ’70s live again.
Adding to this perception, the Spotify page for “Daisy Jones & The Six” credits episode tracks under their fellow fictional musicians: “The Dunne Brothers,” “Wyatt Stone,” “The Winters,” and “Simone Jackson.” Atypical for soundtracks, this creates the sense that these people truly existed a while ago before fading away into the depths of Spotify.
And the internet is eager to discover them, with this renaissance of nostalgia thriving on Tiktok. There, Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 song “Dreams” went viral and returned its album “Rumours” to the U.S. Top 40 in 2020. ’90s and Y2K style is trending. Taylor Swift marketed her record-shattering album “Midnights” with videos in the same ’70s aesthetic as the “Daisy Jones” paraphernalia: orangey-browns, bold stripes, and grainy-photo quality galore. Upon its release, “AURORA” reached #1 on the U.S. iTunes chart.
“Daisy Jones & The Six” serves up the past to a generation that clearly craves it. Living in a present dominated by the monotony of screens, scrolling, and social media leaves us gasping to feel alive. We invest ourselves into media, art, and even people in order to feel more intensely, and into the past to find romantic simplicity. Enter the vintage formula of sex, drugs, and rock ’n roll, so passionate it implodes: It reignites the senses and the heart alike. The visible remnants of ’70s pop culture glimmer with mystique and an impenetrable iconicity, rosily tinting our perceptions of the era. What’s more, “Daisy Jones” actress Riley Keough is the granddaughter of Elvis Presley himself, adding an aura of dynastic rock royalty.
The counterpart to drawing a romanticized past close is doing the same to people. Not only do we want to feel real, we want characters and celebrities to feel real. Parasocial relationships, in which fans act as if they personally know a media figure, are particularly visible in pop artists’ fanbases. “Daisy Jones” makes the characters our celebrities, blurring the lines between them and activating multiple levels of obsession.
On a topless Instagram post that evokes the book’s description of the “AURORA” album cover, Keough gets comments like “major daisy jones vibes” and “we love you daisy jones” followed by a slew of crying emojis. Like Daisy, Keough is the beautiful face of the brand. The commenters exhibit pleasure and even catharsis in seeing an actress resemble her character. Fiction is one step closer to reality: Daisy Jones lives.
This fiction-to-life transformation extends to cast dynamics. Actors display their camaraderie in press interviews, inviting the viewer to join in on the jokes and warm feelings. It’s comforting to feel like our emotional attachments are shared by those pretending onscreen. On some level, we hope, they’re not pretending.
With little music experience, the “Daisy Jones” ensemble underwent an intensive band camp that resulted in a real album and real bonds. Instead of casting seasoned musicians or adding digital tricks, the show landed on something perhaps more appealing to our desire for authenticity. The cast is like the band, risky and unpredictable and exciting.
We listen to “AURORA,” then want the story behind Daisy Jones & The Six’s break up. We admire the visuals, adopt the obsession, and become the audience for the nostalgic fantasy they’ve created. And the show’s marketing is prepared — Amazon has band merch already waiting for us.

Major spoilers for “Abbott Elementary” ahead.
Since the ’80s, male film actors have been stealing the audience’s hearts with their perfect looks and charming smiles, but in the ’90s the same phenomenon expanded to teen sitcom stars. From Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Zach Morris in “Saved By the Bell,”to Joshua Jackson as Pacey in the hit series “Dawson’s Creek,” sitcoms have typically had a “hot guy” character that they push and want the public to view in a certain way. This heartthrob phenomenon has created a standard for male actors based on attractiveness and their ability to make the viewers gush over them. Through on screen romantic gestures, a longing gaze, and easy to fall for smiles, show creators and producers continue to write characters so that male actors can make the viewers’ hearts flutter.
But why do directors and screenwriters intend to create heartthrobs in the first place, and how does this change the way the actor is perceived by the audience? The moment the actor is labeled as a heartthrob it can entrap them in this category, blurring the line between talent and good looks, thereby leading them to gain popularity for their attractiveness rather than their acting. As seen in the film industry, Hugh Grant is widely known as the strapping male lead for swoon-worthy rom-coms, including “Notting Hill,” “Love Actually,” and “Bridget Jones's Diary.” Grant achieved acclaim and success, but when it was time to move on from playing that type of character, it was difficult for him to land roles outside of this genre.
These kinds of heartthrobs are now popularized in the television industry as a whole, as more male characters from TV shows and sitcoms are being placed on this pedestal. Social media, fan reactions, and press interviews have played a major role in the growth of this trend. On social media, video edits of male characters are easily created and shared by fans who are enamored with the actor’s role, which influences what the public views as the “it man” of the month. Additionally, press interviews for the sitcoms focus on the love interest and potential relationships in the shows, tailoring their questions to highlight the romantic aspects of the show. This encourages the viewers to root for a certain couple, and causes them to notice the male character’s attractiveness and positive qualities.
Recently, Tyler James Williams from the hit sitcom “Abbott Elementary” has earned this title for his role as the elementary teacher and love interest, Gregory Eddie. In particular, the buildup of his romantic relationship with coworker Janine Teagues (Quinta Brunson) has led viewers to swoon over Williams and view him in a different light than he had been viewed previously in his career.
The show’s popularity is mostly due to Gregory and Janine’s will-they-won’t-they plot. Fans have watched the tension build and a special friendship form between the two characters, which has contributed to Gregory’s establishment as the sitcom’s heartthrob. On top of it all, Williams has the good looks and charisma to fit the part.
Brunson, the series writer, creator, and producer of this Emmy and Golden Globe-winning series was interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter and discussed this heartthrob trend. In the interview, Brunson explains that male actors can be made to be perceived as hot to the wider public because the show is essentially telling audiences that they are hot. She specifically mentioned that she told Williams he would become a heartthrob because of the way Gregory was being written. However, after the article implied Brunson should be credited for making Williams be viewed in this way, she refused to take credit for this.
Although Brunson’s short tweet reply — which simply stated “No I didn’t” — did not answer the question of how she intended to participate in the heartthrob trend she identified, it is clear that Williams has earned the title of heartthrob and it has changed the way people think of him. In an interview on “The Tonight Show,” Williams shared that people now view him differently because of his character in the sitcom. As they walk by him on the street, he says he can tell from their facial expressions what work they recognize him for, as viewers did not give him the same reactions for his roles in the iconic series “Everybody Hates Chris” or “The Walking Dead.” As the show is set to release a third season, it will be interesting to see how Gregory’s character develops and contributes to Williams’s portrayal of being a heart stealer. That being said, it does raise concerns that his future roles might constrain him to this category.
Not only do the writers of television series create heartthrobs for a viewer’s entertainment, but the use of social media also contributes to the growth of this phenomenon. Particularly, edits on TikTok have become increasingly popular and have proven to hold an immense amount of power in creating heartthrobs, as seen with videos of actor Pedro Pascal from the current HBO series “The Last of Us”, who has become the man of the moment on the internet. TikTok edits of Pascal as his characters in shows such as “Narcos” and “The Last of Us,” have brought much attention to his attractiveness and endearing personality. Pascal is only one of the many male actors that have been popularized in this way.
The sitcom archetype of the hot male lead has helped boost the careers and public perceptions of many male actors, but for some has also restricted the roles they are able to to take on as they age out of this character type. Fan use of social media has made this trend more pronounced in recent years, but Brunson’s interview and her tweet reveal that the hearthrob narrative fails to do the actor’s abilities justice. Although shows that capitalize on this trend gain a lot of popularity, it’s important to focus on the actor separately so as to not ignore their acting skills for their good looks.

Many are aware of the influence of social movements against sexual violence, such as the #MeToo campaign in the United States. However, very few Americans have been exposed to the origins and history of South Korea’s feminist movement, which has similarly blossomed in recent years. Hawon Jung’s “Flowers of Fire” aims to provide readers with firsthand accounts that not only allow them to understand the uniqueness of the feminist movement in South Korea, but also give readers the tools to recognize the key differences between the fight for gender equality in South Korea and abroad.
The book begins with an anecdotal account of a young Korean woman at a feminist rally at Seoul’s theater district of Hyehwa, then quickly transitions into records of South Korea’s deep-rooted patriarchal society. Jung repeatedly relies on this structure to provide readers with cultural and historical awareness as well as personal perspectives — a necessary refinement in a book where explanations of Korean words and traditions such as “molka” and “hoesik” are needed to illuminate personal accounts.
Another strength of the book is Jung’s decision to separate the book into four parts. As the history of South Korea’s feminist movement is nuanced and lengthy, each of these sections help segment the book to explain the movement in the clearest way possible. The first part — “#MeToo, #WithYou,” — clarifies the recent explosion of the movement in Korea; the second section — “Where Did All the Girls Go?” — focuses on early feminist activists fighting against Korea’s deeply patriarchal society; and the third segment — “My Life is Not Your Porn” — explains the popularity of hidden spy cameras in female bathrooms. The final section, “My Body,” is dedicated to South Korea’s beauty standards and other prominent societal pressures on the female body. This division of the book allows readers to mentally compartmentalize key aspects of South Korea’s movement in order to emphasize the elements of the #MeToo movement that are unique to South Korea.
In addition, Jung, who is a former Seoul correspondent for the AFP news agency, uses a very objective tone throughout the book — with the exception of the book’s signature anecdotes — which complements her comprehensive research (as evidenced by her 47 pages of references). Jung’s thorough use of both primary and secondary sources allows her to make objective assertions on the visible impact of the movement by effectively communicating statistical evidence and public opinion data, which is heavily cited in all four parts of her book.
Jung’s choice to balance primary and secondary sources, however, tends to detract from the power of personal accounts. Although the historical explanations and public opinion data allow lots of detailed information to be packed into the book, this strategy tends to cut into the stories of real women’s encounters with sexism. Sometimes within the same chapter, Jung will begin with a firsthand account of a Korean woman dealing with sexism and then abruptly switch to a new story, leaving readers longing for a sense of closure or merely just more words about the previous story. While the sheer number and diverse array of personal accounts that Jung shares — ranging from the anecdotes of attorney Seo Ji-Hyun to student Sophie Park to incest-survivor-turned-activist Blue Butterfly — is impressive, readers may feel that not enough pages were dedicated to each individual’s complicated story.
Overall, “Flowers of Fire” is a compelling exploration of South Korea's feminist movement that offers readers a nuanced understanding of its history and cultural context. Jung’s comprehensive research and objective tone make this book a valuable contribution to literature on the feminist movement in South Korea. While this book could be improved with more time and dedication to individuals’ personal anecdotes, “Flowers of Fire” ultimately still serves its purpose of illuminating the complexities of gender inequality and social movements in contemporary South Korea.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you walk into Lamont Library at 4 a.m., you will likely find many resolute Harvard students finishing essays, working on problem sets, or cramming for exams. These are the Lamonsters. Lamonsters are a special breed of student intent on taking advantage of Lamont Library’s 24-hour availability, and clearly willing to compromise on spending time on other seemingly unimportant things in life, like sleep.
I am convinced there is a Lamonster within every Harvard student, an inner voice telling us to take advantage of the late-night study opportunities and turn every second of every day into a productive moment. There seems to be a sense of pride in announcing “I got three hours of sleep last night” or “I slept at 6 a.m.”
But sleep isn’t the place to cut corners.
Sleep is our body’s time to grow and recuperate: from boosting our immune systems to ridding our brains of toxin buildup. The release of growth hormones during sleep is essential for development and metabolism. Perhaps most pertinently to students, sleep allows the brain to perform memory consolidation, essentially converting our daily experiences into long-term memories in the form of modified neuronal connections.
This explains why spending the whole night studying for an exam may prove futile in the long run versus catching a few extra hours of sleep. Accumulating such sleep debt may lead to obesity, cardiovascular issues, and other severe life threats. And sleep debt is not easy to repay: Research has shown that it can take up to four days of quality sleep to account for one lost hour of sleep.
Still, skipping sleep is appealing. Between classes, extracurriculars, and jobs, students have packed schedules. How are we supposed to get everything done in the limited waking hours of the day? Are there ways to get around the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep?
A commonly employed strategy is naps. Several recent studies have shown that supplemental daily daytime naps can actually improve memory consolidation and learning.
But not all naps are energizing.
As we sleep, our bodies cycle between four stages. Stages one and two are shallow sleep, in which our bodies begin relaxing. In stage three, our bodies enter deep sleep. Finally, in stage four, or rapid eye movement sleep, brain activity becomes similar to waking levels. This stage of sleep is believed to aid with cognitive functions like memory and creativity.
It is difficult to wake up when you are in stage three deep sleep. Doing so can leave you groggy and tired — quite literally getting up on the wrong side of the bed. So approximately 20-minute power naps, in which you are restricted to stages one and two, or longer 90-minute naps, during which your body cycles through the four stages, are ideal.
Another way to avoid feeling groggy is through lighting. Part of how our bodies determine when we should sleep is by recognizing light. In our brains, a structure called the suprachiasmatic nucleus detects light. As it starts getting dark, this structure signals the pineal gland to secrete melatonin, the hormone that keeps us on 24-hour cycles or circadian rhythms — especially the sleep-wake one.
We can manipulate our circadian rhythms by exposing ourselves to more light. Bright light in the morning can make you fall asleep earlier in the night; bright light in the evening can lead you to fall asleep later.
The color of the light can also impact wakefulness. Evolutionarily, this system allowed us to make the most out of natural changes in light color throughout the day, from red-yellow at sunrise to blue-white during the day and back to red-yellow for sunset. While white and blue LED lights can suppress melatonin secretion and lead to subsequent alertness, yellow light doesn’t impact our circadian rhythms much.
This suggests the need to rotate through libraries at Harvard. Spending a few hours in Cabot Library’s white and brightly-lit library in the evening, before heading to Lamont’s yellow and relatively dimly-lit basement, might surprisingly help you remain energized.
Sleep is inevitable, though. While taking naps and being aware of situational lighting can help you better optimize your day, science tells us that it is important to dedicate time to sleep and honor that commitment.
If you’re dozing off during a particularly long lecture, or can only get through the day when you’re amped up on caffeine, your body is telling you that you need rest and recuperation. So for all the habitual Lamonsters, ask for extensions, take later classes, and go to sleep!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Are we the last generation of English majors?
A recent New Yorker article warns we might be. The piece worries that humanities enrollment — which has declined by 17 percent over the past decade — is in “free fall” due to a mixture of professional pressures, changing university investment patterns, and economic incentives facing students.
It’s only the latest contribution to the now-ubiquitous humanities versus STEM dichotomy — including two nearly decade-old opinions from this Editorial Board, titled “Let Them Eat Code” and “Let Them Eat Camus,” in which we found the latter ascendant and the former moribund.
However, when it comes to sweeping pronouncements about the extinction of English, we remain skeptical. This crisis narrative seems exaggerated and anecdotal at best, stemming from a lack of detailed statistics regarding the so-called decline of humanities.
To start, the very definition of what constitutes a humanities field is in flux. Different definitions of a humanity include or omit fields like History inconsistently, and adjacent or interdisciplinary fields — think of Harvard’s own Social Studies or History of Science concentrations — often expose students to humanities scholarship, even if they’re not officially counted as such.
We do know that the absolute number of humanities degree holders has, on net, increased over the past five decades. Furthermore, students of other disciplines can and do benefit from humanities education at most modern universities, thanks to core and distributional requirements.
Before making broad claims about the vitality — or, more specifically, the lack thereof — of the humanities, we find it crucial to look at data such as per-year enrollment statistics for humanities classes in order to paint a more granular image of the state of Camus on campuses today.
Of course, the humanities are incredibly worthwhile; none of our skepticism about the statistics attached to the narrative of their extinction, as over-sensationalized as we may consider it to be, should be taken to suggest otherwise. There is both innate and instrumental value to literature, philosophy, and art — subjects that have illuminated human civilization for millennia and will almost undoubtedly continue to do so even amidst dramatic projections of their decline.
However, many who decry the “death of the humanities” falsely see the humanities as claiming exclusive rights to complex conversations about what it means to be human — conversations that, the logic follows, will disappear along with the humanities as we know them. This displays a fundamental misunderstanding about the purpose of STEM scholarship. Biology and chemistry investigate the complex mechanisms allowing for human life. Mathematics and physics model every aspect of our quotidian existence using reason and logic. And increasingly, computer science is dealing directly with questions about what it means to be human as it tries to create humanity without the human — through artificial intelligence.
The discourse around the decline of the humanities also tends to focus on the most traditional and Western-centric fields, particularly English, ignoring the emergence of novel fields like ethnic studies. Generalizing the decline of English degrees into the decline of the humanities as a whole reduces the humanities to only one point of view, ignoring newfound diversity in the ways we tell stories about the human experience.
We would also be remiss not to address one of the primary sticking points in the alleged conflict between code and Camus: doubt regarding the employability of humanities majors. There is a perceived relationship between students’ majors and their career prospects. Some students, especially those from low-income backgrounds, may feel pressured to choose their major with this perception in mind.
But in general, we do not definitively know why students choose the majors they do. Each student weighs various questions when making this personal decision — and employability, although a realistic concern for most, is often just one among multiple factors. Attributing perceived declines in humanities degrees solely to perceptions of employment reflects a general bias against the humanities as unemployable fields of study.
Given the magnitude of careers out there, every discipline can be studied on multiple pre-professional paths with varying levels of desirability and starting salary. Humanities degrees like history, English, and philosophy are incredibly popular among future high-profile lawyers. Meanwhile, many STEM students, especially those in more theoretical fields like pure mathematics, could spend much of their careers in the more opaque world of academia.
We reject many of these artificial divides between disciplines altogether. All too often, we perceive a sensationalized conflict between STEM and the humanities, pitting each side against each other in an unproductive Manichean narrative. In reality, our world is nothing if not interdisciplinary, especially when addressing important questions about what it means to be human. And the benefits of a broad, well-rounded education are manifold: As political theorists have long recognized, a well-functioning society is oiled by informed, engaged public discourse among citizens knowledgeable in a variety of fields.
Accordingly, it’s essential for Harvard — and all schools — to fund disciplines, no matter their enrollment, in line with their needs. Dwindling numbers can reflect many things, especially shifting attitudes and demographics amongst students. They do not, however, determine how important a discipline is, and should not be treated as such.
In the meantime, we feel that it’s time to rethink the General Education system. Courses are too easy and too shallow, allowing students to skate through Harvard by only ever taking challenging and engaging courses in their chosen discipline. This is not only contradictory to the promise of a liberal arts education but also detrimental to our collective understanding of the world. We urge Harvard to consider amending the GenEd system to instead focus on foundational, survey-style courses across prominent disciplines, allowing students to deeply and systematically engage with the diverse lines of inquiry in academia.
Are we the last generation of English majors? No. We’re also not the last generation of computer scientists, biologists, or mathematicians. The future is interdisciplinary. The energy currently invested in unproductive squabbles between STEM and the humanities should be harnessed into collective dialogue and inquiry seeking to drive our current world forward.
In short, we not only can, but also should, have our code and eat Camus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After each meeting of my African politics class last semester, my mind buzzed with new revelations. It felt like I had unlocked a field of study previously unknown to me. Having spent my short academic career essentially thinking ‘international relations’ was a shorthand for the caprices of permanent United Nations Security Council members, the opportunity to learn about complex political interactions on the African continent assumed a new magnetism.
What I didn’t realize was that this feeling manifested perhaps the greatest curricular blind spot in Harvard’s Department of Government.
As far as I could find, Harvard offers only one class centered squarely on African politics: Gov 94GD: “Africa: Power and Politics.” The class, an option within the department’s Gov 94 seminar program, fielded just 10 students last semester, including myself. What’s more, its instructor — Christopher E. Rhodes ’04 — isn’t even a full-fledged Harvard faculty member but a visiting lecturer from across the Charles River at Boston University.
The course’s continent-wide scope means that graduating students might not be able to call themselves experts on African affairs, but they could probably hold their own in a 30-second conversation on the Lord’s Resistance Army, a step or three beyond most Americans. And most crucially, the class casts light upon a region of the world that traditional international relations inquiry far too often leaves in the dark.
Harvard’s undergraduate programming focused on African government should not consist entirely of an afternoon chat between 10 students. The department should, at minimum, provide an unlimited enrollment, lecture-based survey course to the effect of Steven R. Levitsky’s class on Latin American comparative politics, lest budding Harvard scholars of government graduate without any knowledge of a region that grows more crucial to the global order each day.
This 2022-23 academic year, a course directory search for “Africa politics” yields disappointing results. Of just 12 independent Faculty of Arts and Sciences results, two are literature surveys, three are more focused on colonialism and postcolonial development, two concern only North Africa and the Middle East, and one is John L. Comaroff’s anthropology of law course. Other than Gov 94GD, the closest thing to a region-wide government class is Hist 1901: “Nationalism, Political Independence, and Economic Development in Africa,” which markets itself more as a journey in historical and structural analysis than a modern-day assessment of political actors and forces. There seems to exist no class on contemporary African politics beyond my little seminar.
This dearth of knowledge couldn’t persist at a more inopportune geopolitical moment, as formerly weak African nations have begun to play far greater roles in both the global economy and international politics at large. The legacy of colonialism in African state-building allowed extractive institutions — mechanisms that social scientists define as being “designed to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society to benefit a different subset” — to persist long after independence. An example would be the exploitative Kimberley diamond mines in the British Cape Colony, from which colonial profits flowed to a small circle of private magnates and postcolonial profits flowed to the colossal diamond-trade superpower De Beers Group, whose Consolidated Mines subsidiary owned the Kimberley mines until 2016.
Now, however, African leaders are replacing these institutions with more sustainable investment partnerships. As one accounting firm noted, extractive industries in Africa accounted for over half of investment every year save one between 2005 and 2011, but made up a minority of investment in every year save one between 2012 and 2018.
If the promise of greater participation in global markets isn’t enough, consider foreign policy: Africa has quickly become ground zero for a proxy war of influence between China and the United States. Over the last 20-plus years, China has taken on a rapacious series of development initiatives in Africa, formalized in 2013 as the Belt and Road Initiative. In August 2022, the Biden-Harris administration called China’s initiatives a strategy to “challenge the rules-based international order, advance its own narrow commercial and geopolitical interests, undermine transparency and openness, and weaken U.S. relations with African peoples and governments.” Clearly, an in-class exploration of these trends through an African political lens justifies whatever low cost to Harvard it would exact.
A broad African politics class could have value that extends beyond the salience of its material, however. To pass on making available a broad and pluralistic image of African politics to Harvard students creates dangerous room for the “single story” of African homogeneity to take hold; students will not necessarily know that African governance ranges from a robust parliamentary republic in Botswana to an authoritarian regime headed by the world’s longest ruling dictator in Equatorial Guinea. Instead, the archetypal, all-too-common perception that sub-Saharan Africa is some amalgamation of identical, weak feudal states will find new hosts to infect.
Granted, it might be unfair to place all of the blame on Harvard’s course design. The total class size of 10 in Gov 94GD does not imply any kind of overwhelming demand for knowledge of African government. More troubling still was the class makeup, as most of its students introduced themselves as hailing from some African nation — suggesting students without a personal connection to Africa were less likely to pursue studies thereof. Still, there is no reason to believe a well-taught, gripping class on African political affairs could not build momentum among curious students and attract a healthy enrollment.
Harvard says it endeavors to educate leaders of the future. Today’s interconnected world demands that an adept leader bear a nuanced understanding of all places and peoples. In seeking to convey this understanding, Harvard must begin with the most obvious unit of measurement: the classes we take.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 100 protesters gathered outside of Cambridge City Hall on Monday for the latest demonstration in a monthslong series of protests following the killing of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge Police Department officer.
At the rally, protesters reiterated their demands for the officers involved in the shooting to be named, terminated, and criminally charged and for the city to release the full unredacted police report. City officials will release the names of the officers involved and the police report following the completion of an investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
Faisal, a Bangladeshi American student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was fatally shot by a CPD officer on Jan. 4 after officers responded to a 911 report of a man harming himself, according to a CPD press release. Police officials have maintained that Faisal approached officers wielding a knife following a five-block chase, and when a non-lethal sponge round failed to stop him, an officer shot and killed him.
The police killing of Faisal has sparked allegations of police brutality and racism, condemnation of city officials for their handling of the situation, and more than a dozen protests in the months since, including in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In the wake of the killing, city officials have pledged to implement police reforms including equipping CPD officers with body cameras and increasing funding for non-police public safety alternatives.
“We’ve been out here on the streets day after day, week after week, month after month,” said Susanna Chen, a senior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
Harvard junior Afiya Rahman ’24 called on Harvard students to be more involved in the protests against Faisal’s killing.
“It’s embarrassing that as Harvard students, a ten-minute walk away to City Hall is too much of a barrier for you all to be here,” said Rahman, a Crimson Editorial editor. “Faisal was 20, and it’s so disappointing to see students not show up and support someone from their community.”
Some protesters also criticized the city’s recent decision to hire the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing think tank, to conduct an independent external review of the department following Faisal’s killing.
Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Matthew Kennedy questioned the independence of the investigation due to the involvement of current and former police officers in the organization.
“Their president, their vice president, their treasurer, and their secretary are all cops,” Kennedy said as protesters booed. “These are people who have gone through decades of absorbing police propaganda uncritically.”
Police Executive Research Forum Executive Director Chuck Wexler said in a phone call with The Crimson that while there are police chiefs on the organization’s board, the think tank operates independently of police departments and aims to improve policing practices.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email that the external review will include input from both police and non-police consultants from the think tank.
Many speakers at the protest questioned the need for police, with some residents sharing their personal experiences with policing in Cambridge and across the country.
“My brother Thomas Purdy was 38 years old. He was a resident of Massachusetts when he took a vacation to Reno, Nevada. He never made it home alive,” resident AnneMarie Grant said. “It keeps me up every night of my life.”
Cambridge officials have agreed to meet representatives from the Party for Socialism and Liberation and Boston-area students Tuesday to discuss the activists’ concerns, the group’s representatives said during the protest. Another rally is set to occur on the steps outside City Hall as the meeting takes place.
“The city has given us a meeting, and we want to be respectful and engage in good faith dialogue,” Chen said. “But we also know that it’s not in their interest to listen to our demands. It’s only now that they’re giving us a meeting because they have seen the power of our movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow traveled to Jordan, Israel, and Palestine last week, touring universities and meeting with Harvard alumni at each stop.
Bacow traveled to the Middle East with a large delegation from Harvard that included Adele F. Bacow, his wife; Patricia S. Bellinger ’83, Bacow’s chief of staff; Mark C. Elliott, vice provost for international affairs; Brian K. Lee, vice president for alumni affairs and development; Sarah C. Karmon, executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association; Paul Andrew, vice president for communications and public affairs; and Tarek E. Masoud, who serves as faculty director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative.
The weeklong visit to the Middle East started in Amman, Jordan where Bacow met with alumni at an event on March 11.
Jeromel Dela Rosa Lara ’23, who is currently conducting research in Jordan and attended the alumni event in Amman, said that the meeting with Bacow was “an opportunity to form needed connections and much needed bridges, especially with Arab communities.”
Lara, a former Crimson editor, said he hopes that Bacow and Harvard officials return to Jordan soon.
“He needs to come back again,” he said. “The next president, President-elect Gay also [needs] to come more frequently to know more about Arab communities here in Jordan, and the rest of the Middle East.”
Bacow also visited the University of Jordan and met with its president, Nathir M. Obeidat.
Obeidat wrote in a tweet in Arabic that he and Bacow exchanged views on the challenges facing higher education in the world and the role universities should play in modernizing societies.
The two also discussed academic and research collaborations between the Harvard and the University of Jordan, as well as student and faculty exchanges, according to Obeidat’s twitter.
Following their stop in Jordan, the Harvard delegation traveled to Israel for an alumni event on March 13 in Tel Aviv, where Bacow sang the Israeli national anthem in Hebrew with attendees. Bacow also visited Tel Aviv University, along with an array of Israeli universities during visits to Haifa and Jerusalem.
On March 14, Bacow traveled to the University of Haifa where he met with the university’s president, Ron Robin. During the visit, Bacow discussed the relationship between the United States and Israel and challenges facing higher education in the 21st century, according to a press release from Haifa University.
The University of Haifa awarded Bacow an honorary degree two years ago in a ceremony that was held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Whether addressing climate change, inequality, the future of democracy, or pushing the frontiers of knowledge, universities such as Haifa and Harvard have a vital role to play through our teaching and our research,” Bacow said during his visit, according to the University of Haifa press release.
Mona Khoury-Kassabri, vice president of strategy and diversity at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, called Bacow very “modest” and “personal.”
“One of the things that was very nice to see — how much he showed an interest in things that we do at the university,” she said in an interview. “Also with the students, he asked them questions.”
In Palestine, Bacow toured Al-Quds University and met with its president, Imad Abu Kishek, and life sciences students. The meeting marked Bacow’s first visit to a Palestinian university, according to a Facebook post after the event by Al-Quds University.
Marwan K. Durzi, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate from Palestine, said he attended the alumni event with Bacow in Ramallah on March 16. Durzi said the event was a chance to discuss how Harvard and its students “can contribute to peace, justice, and equality.”
Durzi said Bacow’s visit to Palestine was an important opportunity to “see things on the ground” and highlight the “detrimental effects of the separation wall, the checkpoints and the settlements, to peace.”
“It’s a unique opportunity, also to listen from the Palestine alumni on the ground in Palestine, just to hear the challenges they’re facing on a daily basis, in order to try to make the Palestinian community’s life better,” he said.
“We emphasize the need to conduct similar visits in the future with the new president,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed the implementation of police body cameras and the third-party review of the Cambridge Police Department’s policies and practices at a virtual council meeting Monday.
CPD Commissioner Christine A. Elow and City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 fielded questions from councilors regarding the city’s police reforms, which come amid backlash following the killing of Sayed Faisal by a CPD officer on Jan. 4.
Councilor Paul F. Toner asked Elow if body cameras for police officers would conflict with Cambridge’s surveillance ordinance, to which Elow responded that she doesn’t “see any real big barriers.”
Elow added, however, that privacy concerns could arise around when officers can turn body cameras on and off and when cameras are recording on private property.
“All of that will be explicitly outlined in the policy,” she said.
Elow and Huang also said they selected the Police Executive Research Forum — a national nonprofit organization — to serve as the independent third party that will review the CPD’s methods for mental health call services and deescalation.
“Both myself and the commissioner and her leadership team had some conversations with a couple of these organizations to explore whether this kind of scope of work would be something that they would be willing and able to do,” Huang said. “PERF really was the best fit.”
During the public comment period at the beginning of the meeting, many Cambridge residents said they support Charter Right 1, which would provide Cambridge Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team — a non-profit focused on non-police responses to crises — city funding and the ability to respond to some 911 calls, including those involving mental illness.
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 exercised her charter right two weeks ago on the measure — then referred to as Policy Order 7 — postponing discussion to this week. The Council added several amendments, ensuring that HEART staff will not respond to 911 calls involving violence without police and providing for an adjustment period before HEART begins its expanded response services.
The Council passed the policy order with the support of seven members.
Other public comments were made on behalf of Starlight Square, a space in Central Square devoted to creative performances, small businesses, and public art.
Numerous Cambridge residents said the space was a neighborhood fixture that brings people together in a city that they said is increasingly out-of-reach for young and low-income people.
There will be a one-week hiatus before the Council reconvenes April 3.

After beginning to collect union cards for official recognition in November, residents and fellows at Mass General Brigham received a surprise announcement via email: a bonus of $3,500 for the 2022 academic year.
When organizers launched their public unionization campaign in late February, MGB administrators sent a slew of emails: one on March 2 announcing a 10 percent salary raise, an increase of the annual stipend to $10,000, and expanded benefits; two on March 7 warning against the unionization effort; and one on March 16 disputing organizers’ talking points.
“We respect the fact that some of you have had questions about the union. We are always open to your questions,” read a March 7 email signed by 30 of MGB’s department chairs. “However, it’s our hope that we can move beyond those questions, so that we can focus all our available energy on our educational programs and see what we can achieve by working together.”
In a March 16 email, MGB Interim Chief Academic Officer Paul J. Anderson and Vice President of Education J. Kevin Tucker sent residents and fellows two documents arguing against unionization.
“If there were ever a time not to sign a union card, that time is now,” one handout stated.
MGB leadership have made the case to housestaff that working directly with the administration is preferable to union bargaining.
“Your entire relationship with Mass General Brigham — including program and education leadership – would change, and in many ways you might not like,” their website reads.
The unionization campaign, named MGB Housestaff United, hopes to file for a union election by the end of the academic year.
Mass General Brigham, which includes both Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, employs more than 2,500 residents and fellows, otherwise known as housestaff. Many of its member hospitals are teaching hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School.
MGB Housestaff United is affiliated with the Committee for Interns and Residents, a local of the Service Employees International Union. The CIR represents roughly 22,000 housestaff nationwide.
“We have shared experiences working for this large hospital system that really led us to want to form a union,” said Kayty E.W. Himmelstein, organizing committee member and Infectious Disease Fellow.
MGB Housestaff United are asking workers to sign union cards that indicate they support unionization and authorize the CIR to act in their interests.
If a majority of housestaff sign cards, MGB Housestaff United can ask hospital administrators for voluntary recognition. If more than 30 percent of eligible workers sign cards, MGB Housestaff can file for a union election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board to be officially recognized even if MGB doesn’t voluntarily recognize them.
Organizers said they did not begin their card campaign until they were confident that they had support from a majority of MGB housestaff.
“We spoke to over a thousand people who verbally told us like, ‘Yes, I think I would support this campaign if you were to get to the point where you had an election,’” said Sascha N. Murillo, organizing committee member and a third-year Internal Medicine resident.
Citing compensation, workplace safety, and burnout prevention as top priorities, MGB Housestaff United organizers seek greater employee representation in decisions that affect them.
“The union was formed out of a desire for us to have a seat at the table to talk about what working conditions we need, what types of pay and benefits we need, and really what our patients need as well,” Himmelstein said.
Organizing committee members pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as the catalyst of the push toward unionization, saying that many employees had limited access to personal protective equipment and little say over reassignments to treat Covid-19 patients.
“Covid really exposed a lot of the vulnerabilities that residents and just healthcare personnel in general face around workplace safety and just our general working conditions,” said Murillo, the third-year resident.
Compensation is especially important to housestaff due to the cost of living in Massachusetts and rising inflation, she added.
“I’m at MGH, and we’re in Beacon Hill, which is incredibly expensive,” Murillo said. “I know my fellow co-residents are spending over half of their paycheck just to have a place to sleep, which is insane for people who have upwards of $300,000 in debt.”
In April 2020, MGB created the House Staff Council to address concerns from residents and fellows. Elected representatives of each department could bring forward concerns to MGB’s General Medical Education Committee.
Third-year Internal Radiology resident and organizing committee member Diego B. Lopez ’13, who was originally part of the House Staff Council, said that while organizers initially tried to get concerns addressed there, “people just kind of gave up because it wasn’t going anywhere.”
While Brigham and Women’s Hospital has maintained a housestaff council since 2017, the broader MGB council ended after two years.
Lopez says that while some concerns could be addressed through the MGB Education Committee, the majority of concerns were “not something the GME committee can address” because the concerns did not pertain to education.
He added that members of the House Staff Council were never able to meet with the Human Resources department or “anyone in administration that actually handled training” during his time on the council.
In fall 2022, the Mass General Brigham Education Operations Coordinating Committee was created to address operational difficulties related to education.
Anderson, the interim chief academic officer, wrote in a statement that the residency program “provides well-rounded support to ensure a meaningful experience, professionally and personally.”
An MGB spokersperson wrote in an emailed statement on March 17 that hospital administrators view working directly with trainees as the best way to meet employees’ needs.
Himmelstein said the formation of a union is a vital step for improving working conditions for housestaff.
“Unlike a house staff council, a union is a legally recognized body that the employer is required to negotiate with,” Himmelstein said. “I think we feel that in order to have our concerns addressed in a meaningful way, we really need that legal mandate for our employer to meet with us and talk about our concerns.”
MGB Housestaff United began quietly collecting cards in November, months before launching publicly in late February.
“Mostly we’ve just been trying to talk to as many residents as possible,” Murillo said. “Our unit would be like 2,600 people, so we wanted to make sure we had a good base of support.”
On their website, MGB described organizers as “encouraging or pressuring others to join their effort.”
Since October 2021, according to Lopez, housestaff have been receiving emails from hospital administrators expressing appreciation for residents.
“It’s very, very common to see these kinds of things during this phase of the campaign when things are still technically underground, although the employer is very obviously well aware of what’s going on,” said Annie Della Fera, a communications coordinator for CIR, MGB Housestaff United’s parent union.
In addition to the $3,500 bonus, the increased annual stipend, and the 10 percent salary raise — which includes a 7.5 percent market adjustment and 2.5 percent wage increase — the hospital system also offered other benefits, including an expansion of their employee health insurance, a contribution of 2 percent of annual base pay to a retirement savings plan for each resident, and an extension of their existing disability insurance for clinical fellows to residents.
“Most housestaff have understood that this is a clear response to us unionizing and to us having more power,” Himmelstein said.
On their website, MGB denied claims that recent raises were in response to the ongoing union push.
“We do not need anyone else to tell us that competitive and attractive wages and benefits are important to our Trainees — we already know that,” the website reads.
According to the site, recent compensation increases are part of a broader “multi-year process to assess and adjust the compensation and benefits of our entire workforce based on the market.”
MGB Housestaff United organizers said the recent compensation increases prove that a formal union would further improve benefits for housestaff.
“They’ve already been able to pressure MGB and make them uncomfortable enough that they’re starting to see a response from the employer,” Della Fera said.
The March 7 email signed by MGB department chairs stated that recent compensation increases and benefits “demonstrate that the needs of our trainees and our training programs are a top priority, and that our voices together have been heard.”
“We ask for your support to allow us to continue to do this with you directly,” the email concluded.
In its March 16 email, MGB also distributed information on what unionization means for housestaff, including telling them that between contract negotiations, “new or unique and individual needs could not be addressed directly between you and your Program or Fellowship director.”
“What we’ve seen has been a really coordinated effort by MGB to stop us from forming a union,” Himmelstein said.
Members of the MGB Housestaff United organizing committee said department chairs and program directors began holding meetings with residents and fellows during working hours in January to “try to convince us that forming a union would be bad for us,” Himmelstein said.
“It’s very coercive,” she said. “These are people who are not only our current bosses, but also, we are in training programs, and we rely on these people for letters of recommendation and for references for us to get our first attending jobs.”
On its website, MGB said it is “committed to providing factual information for Trainees and others who have questions about the union organizing activity” and the collective bargaining process as a whole.
While MGB’s site says it is not “anti-union,” MGB Housestaff United organizers said their decision to launch publicly was a response to what they felt was “anti-union activity.”
“Now because we’ve been facing a very, very public and open boss fight, we had to come out and be public so we could respond,” Murillo said.
Should the MGB Housestaff United reach the 30 percent threshold needed to request voluntary recognition, MGB is expected to deny it; the hospital system’s site states that it “would insist on an NLRB election so every voice can be heard.”
Organizing committee members said they expect to conclude their card campaign in the coming weeks and file for an election by the end of the academic year.
“We are at this incredibly powerful and wealthy institution, and we need to help have a say in how the power and resources here are directed to improve the lives of workers and the lives of patients,” Himmelstein said.

When Mateo Gomez invited his older sister, Andrea Gomez, to visit him at his home in New York City for her 33rd birthday, he had a plan.
The pair saw a drag show and watched “Dear Evan Hansen” on Broadway, walking for hours between each stop on the trip. As they walked, Mateo Gomez told his sister — a Miami, Florida resident — that each destination was just around the corner.
“It was so much fun, every walk everywhere because he will say, ‘Oh, it’s just right here,’ and I will walk and walk and walk for hours,” Andrea Gomez said. “I was like, this is not funny. We don’t walk in Miami like this.”
For his sister’s birthday last year, Mateo Gomez flew in from Boston to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he took a train straight from the airport to a club in downtown Miami to attend her party.
“All the way down from there to the club with his luggage to go party with me,” Andrea Gomez said. “That was very sweet — very special.”
Mateo Gomez, a Harvard Kennedy School student in the mid-career master in public administration program and a special agent for the FBI, was born in Medellín, Colombia, and immigrated to Miami when he was 10. Friends and family remember Gomez as a fierce advocate for LGBTQ+ rights who was passionate about giving back to those around him.
Gomez died by suicide at his residence in Boston on Dec. 17, 2022. He was 32.
When Mateo Gomez was admitted to Cornell University for his undergraduate degree, Andrea Gomez said it was an important moment for their family. The family learned to speak English through the many jobs they worked in the service industry, she said, and none spoke English before moving to the United States.
“It was the first one of us leaving home to go to a university, and my mom was very excited and very supportive,” Andrea said. “We all were, and were very proud of him. And we always supported him in whatever he wanted to do.”
In summer 2012, after his graduation from Cornell, Mateo Gomez began working at Teach for America, a national nonprofit that trains recent college graduates to serve as teachers for underserved classrooms.
He moved to Los Angeles for training, where he met Phil Y Kim, another Teach for America member.
“I think anyone who met Mateo immediately felt a sense of community with him,” Kim said. “He had this ability to relate to people in a way that was just really affirming and welcoming.”
Together, they threw parties and “were meeting everybody they could,” Kim said. They bonded over a similar desire to give back to the education system that they felt they had benefited from.
“He and I were both similar in that we wanted to do something meaningful that had a high impact,” Kim said. “We both cared deeply about our education system and wanted to make a contribution towards the system that really took care of us and benefited and supported us along the way.”
When Gomez began teaching at a middle school in San Jose, California, he developed strong ties with his students, according to Kim. After his death, videos surfaced of Gomez dancing with his students.
“His ability to connect with young people was just so evident in his teaching days, and I know that subsequently, since he left the classroom, he would always fondly recall his relationship with his kids and families that he really enjoyed,” Kim said.
Kim said he believes this same desire to give back led Gomez to join the FBI, starting with working a part-time job in linguistics, then transitioning to full-time work combating cyber crime.
“He has always been someone deeply committed to public service and just really believed in trying to improve things for everyone by working from within,” Kim said.
Gomez’s partner of six months, Luis C. Herrera Favela, said Gomez had a strong drive to improve the world around him.
After the 2016 Pulse Nightclub Shooting in Orlando, Florida, Gomez immediately volunteered to aid the FBI investigation, Herrera Favela said he learned from a colleague following Gomez’s death. Gomez, who shared a Latino and gay identity with many of the victims, helped to comfort those affected by the tragedy, Herrera Favela said the colleague told him.
“In this school, everyone is bragging about things. He never said anything. And he actually was in the frontline of really important things,” Herrera Favela said.
“He always had this amazing sensibility to step back,” Herrera Favela added. “Usually here leadership is understood as the opposite, that stands front. But for him, when he had the opportunity, leadership was exactly the opposite, he would step back and allow other people to say things.”
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf and Senior Associate Dean for Degree Programs and Student Affairs Debra E. Isaacson shared condolences after Gomez’s death in a statement on Dec. 18, 2022.
“When Mateo arrived here for the MC/MPA Summer Program, he described his interests in wonderfully broad and meaningful terms, citing travel, languages, and international affairs alongside coffee, democracy, social justice, and ‘inclusion and equality in the new world,’” they wrote.
“Mateo’s passing is a heartbreaking loss for his family and friends, for everyone at the Kennedy School, and for the many people he had already served in his life or would have served after graduation,” they added.
Mateo Gomez was always open about his identity as a gay man, Andrea Gomez said.
“Very open, no shame,” she said. “My parents have always been very supportive. My dad has gay flags everywhere.”
During his time in the FBI and beyond, Gomez looked to create spaces for LGBTQ+ people. According to Kim, Gomez helped revive the FBI’s participation in New York City’s Pride March and worked to start an LGBTQ+ affinity group within the FBI.
When Gomez first moved to New York at the start of his career with the FBI, he had a challenging time making friends, Kim said.
When Kim visited, the pair decided to attend a drag event put on by the Gay Latino Collective — a New York-based social and professional group — in order to meet more people. When the pair walked in, they didn’t know anyone.
“Of course, with Mateo, we were running late because he’s always doing his hair,” Kim said.
When the pair left the venue, they realized Gomez had learned names but not gotten numbers or social media accounts.
“And classic Mateo, he was both incredibly fun and outgoing and also super shy at the same time,” Kim said. “And I was like, Mateo, go back in and go talk to someone and get a number.”
Ultimately, Gomez became deeply involved with the organization, Kim said.
“Since then I think he just kept on meeting more and more people and he ended up becoming somewhat of a leader in the group, helping to organize things,” Kim said.
“I know they really embraced him,” he added.
In a Dec. 18, 2022 post, the Gay Latino Collective said Gomez’s “calm demeanor” and “dry sense of humor” will “forever bring smiles to our faces.”
“But to us, it’s your love of family and cultural identity that will remain the highlight of your life, for it’s what initially drew us together and always kept our interactions genuine and joyful!” the group wrote in the post.
Though Gomez was open about his sexuality, he rarely discussed his work with the FBI. After his death, family and friends learned more about his stories working as a special agent from his colleagues.
Andrea Gomez recalled a recent Christmas when their family planned on reuniting in Miami. Mateo Gomez canceled three days before with little explanation, saying only that it was work-related.
It wasn’t until after her brother’s death that Andrea Gomez learned about his role investigating Venezuelan criminals who lived in Cabo Verde. He was the only agent in his group who spoke English, Portuguese and Spanish, and the FBI needed him to translate for the operation.
“They were surprising in a way because we didn’t know the level of how important his position was, since he never really spoke much about what he did in his job,” Gomez said. “But at the same time, the way he was as a person and professional — it all made sense. All his coworkers loved him very much because he was very caring, calm, and selfless.”
Still, Gomez’s privacy around his work did not take away from his ability to connect with those around him.
“He had this really calm demeanor about him that I think a lot of people really, really loved about their relationship with him,” Kim said. “You could sit down and talk to him for hours and hours about pretty much anything.”
Herrera Favela said it was “so easy” to be with Gomez, who was “not judgmental at all.”
“Maybe it was a piece of how he talked. He was always interested in you,” Herrera Favela said. “He always memorized small details of your life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tom Hanks, an acclaimed actor and filmmaker, will speak at Harvard’s 372nd Commencement in May, the University announced Tuesday morning.
Hanks will address Harvard’s Class of 2023 during Commencement’s Morning Exercises, which will be held in Tercentenary Theater on May 25. Hanks will also be awarded an honorary Harvard degree during the Commencement exercises.
This year’s Commencement marks a return to the ordinary for Harvard. After in-person ceremonies for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 were canceled due to the pandemic, the University held two Commencement Exercises last year: one for the Class of 2022 and another joint ceremony for the Classes of 2020 and 2021.
A household name, Hanks is a Hollywood fixture credited for roles in nearly 100 films, most notably “Forrest Gump,” “Sleepless in Seattle,” and “Saving Private Ryan.” He has won two Academy Awards — out of a total of six nominations — one Golden Globe award, seven Emmy awards, and the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award.
In 2014, Hanks received the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2016, former President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow called Hanks a “true master of his craft” in a press release.
“Over five decades, he has entertained, enlightened, and befriended us,” Bacow said. “In addition to his brilliance as an actor, Tom has demonstrated both an innate empathy and a deep understanding of the human condition.”
“I very much look forward to his address in May,” he added.
After winning his first Academy Award for Best Actor in “Philadelphia,” in which Hanks played a lawyer who was diagnosed with AIDS, Hanks became a longtime supporter of AIDS awareness and research.
Hanks also serves on the board of governors for the National Space Society and was awarded the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award from the Space Foundation for his support of space exploration. He is also the campaign chair for Hidden Heroes, an organization dedicated to supporting military caregivers.
Hanks’ selection marks a departure from government officials who have recently spoken at Commencement, including Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74 and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in last year’s dual Commencement ceremony. Hanks is the first person from the entertainment industry to deliver the Commencement address since filmmaker Steven Spielberg — a frequent collaborator of Hanks — spoke in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Athletic Director Erin McDermott announced in a March 14 email that Harvard Athletics will conduct an independent, external review of the women’s ice hockey program following allegations of abuse leveled against the program and embattled head coach Katey Stone.
Harvard has retained New York law firm Jenner and Block to investigate the allegations against the hockey program. Katya Jestin, co-managing partner of the firm, is leading the inquiry. Jestin is a former assistant U.S. attorney and a specialist in institutional culture investigations.
Over the course of 27 seasons coaching Harvard women’s ice hockey, Stone has garnered more wins than any other female coach in the history of women’s college ice hockey. But this year, Stone has faced allegations of abusive behavior, with the first reports published by the Boston Globe in January.
In an investigation by the Athletic published March 10, Stone is accused of turning a blind eye to hazing, using abusive language against players, and running the team like a “mental-health Hunger Games.”
Through interviews with 30 former players and team associates, the Athletic reported that players were subjected to a fining system based on what they wore or ate — including a “gay tax” or an “Asian tax” — and freshmen were told to complete a “Naked Skate” that left them with “ice burns and bleeding nipples.” Players were also hazed during an annual “Initiation Week,” the Athletic reported, which alumni attended in some years.
The Athletic did not report that Stone was directly involved in the fining system, the “Initiation Week,” or the “Naked Skate,” but Stone allegedly downplayed injuries, made insensitive remarks, and contributed to a negative team culture over her tenure.
In the Athletic’s report, generations of Stone’s players characterized the program as pushing “the boundaries of acceptable treatment of athletes.”
Stone did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the investigation or the allegations against Stone.
In an interview with The Crimson last month, McDermott declined to comment on the allegations against Stone.
But after the Athletic investigation’s release, on March 14, McDermott emailed all Harvard student-athletes “regarding the concerning reports that we have received through media outlets and others about our women's ice hockey program.”
“The most important job I have as Director of Athletics is protecting student-athlete health and safety,” McDermott wrote. “It is also paramount to our culture and community for all to be treated with dignity, and respected as individuals. The conduct alleged does not represent who we are as a Harvard Athletics community. There is no place for behavior that creates peer pressure, humiliation, or physical and emotional harm.”
“This is a good time for reflection, and I encourage all of us — student-athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, administrators, alumni/ae — to commit to our values and live consistently by them through our actions and words,” McDermott added.
On Jan. 27, the Globe published an investigation detailing allegations against Stone from 16 former players, who described a pattern of disregard for physical and mental well-being of athletes, body-shaming, hazing, and insensitive remarks.
The Globe report prominently described an incident where Stone said the team had “too many chiefs and not enough Indians” after a loss to Princeton in the Eastern College Athletic Conference playoffs last February.
The remark led to a review of the program, announced in an April 8, 2022, email by McDermott. But in July, McDermott wrote that Stone would continue to coach the team.
According to the Athletic, ahead of the Globe investigation’s publication, McDermott spoke at the HH Dinner — an alumni weekend event attended by about 50 people this year, including many of Stone’s former and current players as well as employees of Harvard’s athletic department.
There, McDermott lauded Stone’s work and legacy in a speech, and Anne Holland “Holly” Johnson ’96, former captain and member of Stone’s first team, told attendees the program’s reputation is sacred, according to the Athletic.
The Athletic reported to some players and alumni, the event felt like “an effort to galvanize support for Stone and rally people to push back against any criticism to come.”
Stone spoke separately to a group of former players in the team’s locker room during the gathering, the Athletic reported.
“They’re trying to light this program on fire,” Stone said, according to the Athletic. “And we’re not going to let that happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of Harvard Divinity School faculty reflected on the school’s ties to slavery and its responsibility to educate the next generation of religious scholars and leaders in a webinar Monday evening.
The virtual talk was the sixth and final installment of the Divinity School’s “Religion and the Legacies of Slavery” lecture series, which sought to extend the findings from the landmark 2022 Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery report and apply them to the Divinity School’s history, mission, and curriculum.
Associate Dean of the HDS Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Melissa Wood Bartholomew, who co-moderated the event alongside Diane L. Moore, asked panelists to reflect on the core questions of the webinar series.
“What does the academic study of religion teach us about the complex histories and legacies of slavery?” Bartholomew asked. “And how can a deeper understanding of the roles of religion enhance our commitment to a period of action in our contemporary times?”
Karen L. King, whose lecture in February focused on the role of slavery in the formation of Christianity, noted that the Bible has been cited both to justify and condemn slavery.
“The Bible does not have a single coherent or consistent message about enslavement,” King said. “The Bible has been used also to nurture a theology of a god who shares in pain and suffering requires justice and kindness, and who opposes enslavement and its legacies.”
David F. Holland, an HDS professor who studies New England church history, said it is important for Divinity School students to study and deconstruct white supremacy as a “belief system” with rituals and symbols.
Moore, the HDS faculty director of Religion and Public Life, asked panelists how classrooms should go beyond deconstructing “complicated histories” in teaching about the legacy of slavery and how professors can help chart a path forward.
“It is wrong for us to only deconstruct, to take apart, to challenge,” Moore said. “What does it mean to rebuild or reimagine or engage with complexity in different ways?”
Holland said as a historian, he views complexity in academia as “empowering,” enabling students to consider the different paths that could have been taken and how they might “shift the arc of history” today.
Tracey Hucks, a professor of Africana Religious Studies who moderated a discussion on reckoning with and redressing the harms of slavery earlier this month, stressed the importance of “listening with an open heart and an open mind” when discussing the legacies of slavery.
In the last half-hour of discussion, panelists reflected on audience submissions to a questionnaire that had been sent out in advance of the webinar. The questionnaire asked attendees to discuss what they learned and connect it to their own lives.
Divinity School professor Terrence L. Johnson said one audience response challenged him to think differently about reparations as a tenet of “political liberalism.”
“Just as we talk about equality of opportunity and equal rights, we need to talk about this idea of reparation for those who have been harmed and wronged by our society,” he said.
Reflecting on the lecture series as a whole, panelists said they were optimistic about the conversations around the legacy of slavery sparked by the webinars.
Divinity School senior lecturer Dan McKanan, whose lecture discussed the role slavery played in the school’s founding, said the responses to the series gave him hope.
“I’m really hoping that we will be on a seedbed of creative thinking about reparation for Harvard as a whole,” McKanan said of the Divinity School, referencing the school’s dependence on “endowed wealth” and ties to religious groups with prior work on reparations.
“I hope that we have created an atmosphere for an honest reckoning within ourselves,” Bartholomew said.

It took Harvard chemistry professor Yoshito Kishi more than 100 steps to synthesize halichondrin B, a potent anticancer agent found naturally in sea sponges in amounts too low to even study. Despite completing his initial synthesis, Kishi continued to study the molecule and improve his methods for two decades, a decision Harvard chemistry professor Eric N. Jacobsen called “unusual in the field.”
Eventually, Kishi and pharmaceutical company Eisai developed the agent into an effective cancer drug called eribulin that currently treats liposarcoma and metastatic breast cancer. Compared to the commonly-used drug dacarbazine, a 2016 FDA clinical trial of 143 patients found eribulin improved the median survival rate from 8.4 months to 15.6 months.
Kishi, well-known for synthesizing complex toxins, also developed a reputation for his diligence.
Kishi came to the lab at 9 a.m. and left at midnight from Monday to Saturday, also stopping by on Sunday to conduct research, according to Tohru Fukuyama, who worked in Kishi’s lab for almost eight years.
“Everybody in this field works hard, but his work ethic was legendary,” Jacobsen said.
A chemistry professor at Harvard for 28 years, Kishi died on Jan. 9 at the age of 85.
Kishi was born in Nagoya, Japan, where he spent his childhood. After receiving his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Nagoya University, he came to Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow and worked with chemistry professor and Nobel laureate Robert B. Woodward, who established the field of complex natural product synthesis.
Kishi returned to Japan as an associate professor at Nagoya University before becoming a chemistry professor at Harvard in 1974, joining a group of organic chemists that helped establish Harvard’s reputation for organic synthesis.
“The luminaries in the field like Woodward, Corey, Kishi, Evans — these are people that really ushered in the way that the entire generation of organic chemists think about how to construct molecules,” said Theodore A. Betley, the current chair of Chemistry and Chemical Biology.
From 1989 to 1992, Kishi was chair of Harvard’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. He became an emeritus professor in 2002 but continued his research and published papers until his death.
Kishi is celebrated in the field of organic synthesis for his total syntheses of complicated natural products, such as halichondrin B, the anticancer molecule that became eribulin, and palytoxin, an extremely poisonous agent produced by some marine corals and algae.
Alexander Wei, a former Harvard chemistry graduate student and currently a professor at Purdue University, said palytoxin was one of the most toxic non-protein compounds known at the time of its isolation in the 1960s and “one of the largest molecules that anybody had ever tried to isolate.” In 1994, Kishi became the first to create the molecule in the lab.
“With his synthesis of palytoxin, he essentially showed that molecules of any complexity, no matter how complex they are, in principle and in practice can be synthesized in the laboratory,” Jacobsen said. “So a lot of people refer to that synthesis as the ‘Mount Everest’ of the field.”
In addition, Jacobsen said, Kishi’s work on halichondrin B gave new meaning to the work of organic synthesis.
“How do you benefit humanity from the ability to make complex molecules? I really think Kishi really opened the world's eyes to that,” he said.
René Peters, who was Kishi’s postdoctoral fellow in 2000, wrote in an email to The Crimson, “I think that this courage to break new ground and face the greatest challenges was typical of Yoshito Kishi.”
Kishi is also known for his contributions to theory about acyclic stereocontrol, which Jacobsen said allowed scientists to control “the shapes of molecules as you build them based on the shapes of the building blocks.” Kishi also helped improve the Nozaki–Hiyama–Kishi reaction, which bears his name, by noticing that a small amount of nickel was critical for catalyzing this reaction, according to Betley.
Kishi’s humility often stood out. Wei said one thing “unique to Kishi Sensei is that he was a master of understatement.”
Jacobsen said Kishi would say “very self-effacing things, a little bit joking, but in a very genuine way.”
“Unlike many academics, he didn’t say very much in meetings because he was actually usually very quiet. But when he did say something, it was incredibly thoughtful, and everybody was listening because they knew that he would only speak if he had something very important to say,” Jacobsen said. “His colleagues really valued his insight and his perspective and that made him a very, very special colleague.”
Betley said he appreciated the time Kishi, already an emeritus professor when Betley joined, took to talk to him as a junior colleague.
“Oftentimes when I would ask him for 10 minutes to talk about science, the direction of the department, whatever the case may be, the conversations easily stretched into an hour,” he said.
Peters, now a chemistry professor at the University of Stuttgart, wrote that one evening in the lab, Kishi “said that he had just rediscovered in his desk his asymmetric total synthesis of tetrodotoxin (the poison of puffer fish), which he had completed 28 years earlier, but had not published.”
Kishi told Peters that he had not published around 30 completed total syntheses.
“He was mainly concerned with satisfying his scientific curiosity. He didn’t really care about the public image and reputation,” Peters wrote.
The Kishi lab was a balance of intensity and humor. Fukuyama, a former professor at the University of Tokyo and Rice University, said members of the lab had to “work very hard for him because he himself worked so hard.” To avoid a 70-minute commute, Fukuyama even brought a sleeping bag to spend some nights in the lab.
Wei said the Kishi lab was the only lab in the department to have a lounge space with a TV. Although Kishi sometimes watched sports on it, Wei said he believes the “true reason” was to help his students relax during long nights in the lab.
Nonetheless, Kishi also had a “warmth that was really well hidden,” according to his former graduate student and Columbia University professor Milan N. Stojanovic. Wei said that Kishi had a “wicked sense of humor” and “a very surprisingly playful side to him.”
Laura Blumberg, who joined Kishi’s lab in 1994 as a graduate student, said Kishi’s work ethic might make his lab sound “almost like torture, but somehow it wasn’t because he had a softer side.”
University of Tennessee professor and former Harvard postdoc Michio Kurosu said some of his favorite memories were picnics in May or June, when Kishi would take his group to places around Massachusetts and Maine.
Kishi cherished his family very much, Fukuyama said, noting that the chemist would often bring his two daughters to visit his office on Sundays.
Additionally, Kishi liked to covertly check on his team as they worked, according to former lab members. Tan Choon Hong, a former Harvard postdoc and now a professor at Nanyang Technical University wrote in an email that Kishi “occasionally will sneak up behind me.” After observing him for some time, Kishi would ask him “to perform a thin-layer chromatography on the spot.” Former Harvard chemistry graduate student Margaret C. Hsu said she left cookies she baked on the filing cabinet, and Kishi “would just come by and check on the lab and sneak a cookie.”
In the small amounts of spare time he had, Kishi enjoyed baseball and golf. Blumberg said Kishi would often take postdocs golfing, even bringing graduate students at times.
A baseball player in high school, Kishi was a fan of the Boston Red Sox, especially Japanese pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka; however, he was less impressed with Boston cuisine.
“He was always complaining about not being able to have a good sushi, for example. Like this was the biggest thing that he had trouble with,” Stojanovic said.
Kishi remained a passionate scientist for his entire life, according to his former colleagues. Jacobsen said that “he was a very vigorous and energetic person to the very end, but he was passionately excited about the work that he was doing.”
According to Peters, Kishi dedication to chemistry shone through even in his last years.
“Last July he wrote me ‘I am now bed-resting at home to deal with a medical problem, I do feel I am getting better, but the pace of recovery is frustratingly slow. My goal is to get back to chemistry by the end of summer,’” Peters wrote. “I think that this demonstrates his enormous passion for science.”

Spring semester has been kicking my ass — literally. I’ve been bedridden for the past week-and-a-half trying to overcome the flu, Covid, the plague, who knows? All I know is that during my bed rest, I have had a chance to reflect on the first five months of my life at Harvard — boy was it a wild ride. So, let’s reminisce on aspects of the first semester of freshman year for good ole’ times sake.
HUDS (we love you but…)
I don’t know about you, but HUDS was not doing the thing last semester. Remember those special days once a month when we thought our lives were changing for the better and then quickly realized it was just Parent’s Day or Cuisine Day (yes, HUDS, we now understand your game)? Let’s be serious, the only food we could rely on at lovely Berg were the french fries, sandwich buffet, and Sunday sundaes. I would mention the waffles, but half the time they stuck to the machines just like everyone did to their lanyards in September. I tried to explain to my parents why I was eating out so much at 12 a.m., but they literally shut off my credit cards due to “$pending way too much money at a place called ‘El Jefe’s.’”
The party scene (I’m not sure I would call them parties…)
I believed I was Ke$ha last semester; no party started until I walked in. I was on FIRE. However, I soon realized that what was most important were the memories I made along the way. The walks to the Mather JCR after pregaming with my girlies, squishing together on a packed shuttle leaving the Quad at 1 a.m., the nightcap trudges to Jefe’s and Noch’s, and the vivacious flirting with guys who looked way less hot the next day — those memories never leave you. Trust me, I’ve tried to forget. Let’s keep up the momentum though, because winter is almost over and I have some self-redemption to do (see you soon, Advocate).
Friends (the episode where they all move on)
You live and you learn. None of us would have expected friends from the first months to become passersby you wave to in the Yard (who may or may not wave back), and that’s okay because you’ll always cherish the memories you have together. And if you are still besties with your pre-orientation buddies, congratulations! You are in the top .01 percent of Harvard undergrads. Maybe some of your closest friends are those you met in the Berg line or in Cabot working on an Expos paper. Fun fact, they usually come when you least expect. Shout out to all of my babes I became friends with at late night McDonald’s feasts and Cabot shenanigans — you know who you are.
Comping (was getting into Harvard not hard enough?)
How in the world did all of you hear about punching and comping so soon? I was still buying dorm decorations and asking other freshmen what they were studying in the Yard while you sharks were wearing suits pretending to be members of the Royal Family at social clubs. I had no clue Harvard social life and clubs were so competitive! Nevertheless, I jumped into the comping piranha tank and auditioned for Harvard A Cappella. In my opinion, a cappella at Harvard is one of the hardest comps of them all — HCCG? A gem in comparison.
There is no shame in feeling like you made some mistakes last semester — everyone has regrets! Harvard did warn us that the semester was going to be a ‘transformative experience.’ So, let it be that. Lean into the growth and hey, even if you screw up, we still have six-and-a-half more semesters to go!
