After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget the jargon for a moment.
Intersectionality, privilege, heteronormativity. Cissexism, feminism, microaggression.
These words are important—they describe complex concepts that have been explored and supported by reams of research literature. But for many students on this campus, and certainly for the majority of people in this country, these words are new and strange.
So we won’t start there. In order for these words to have meaning, we must have empathy. Change begins with empathy—the basic recognition that we should treat other people as, well, people. So let’s start with that.
The daily reality for trans persons—people whose gender identity differs from their sex at birth—is, at best, hostile indifference, and at worst, an active intolerance. Tragically, this intolerance often manifests itself in violence: A comprehensive study by the EU found that nearly one in 10 trans respondents was physically or sexually attacked or threatened with violence because of their perceived identity.
And violence is just the tip of the iceberg. Lurking beneath are ugly prejudices—some unconscious, many conscious—which make people feel unwelcome in what should be their own communities.
These issues are interdependent, and any response must be multifaceted. To that end, the UC is launching Side by Side, a campaign to promote gender solidarity and inclusion on campus. We do not presume that gender is the only facet of a person’s identity, nor can we possibly hope to speak for all the rich and complex set of experiences created when gender and other identities intersect. But we can hope to create a safe, inclusive space for all gender identities to share their experiences in a spirit of alliance.
We are not the first to make these points, nor are we necessarily even the best people to effect the changes that they call for. After years of combined experience on the UC, we would be foolish to proclaim that this campaign will single-handedly change the culture of the College—heck, we couldn’t even make a public nap space happen. But we can hope to provide a platform for the growing chorus of voices that say that gender-based discrimination is unacceptable, and that everyone should feel welcome in the Harvard community.
As part of Side by Side, we’ve asked every student group to partner with us by submitting pledges with concrete plans towards reducing gender-based discrimination. The Harvard Science Review, for instance, has pledged to incorporate “themes for [their] issues that will encourage conversations about social as well as scientific topics that will appeal to a wide audience.” The Havard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers has pledged to hold at least one collaborative event with another student group on issues of community and inclusivity.
And as the saying goes, change begins at home. Three years ago, when a guest speaker from the Office of BGLTQ Student Life introduced herself to the UC with her name and her preferred gender pronouns, she was greeted with snickers. And after the general election last fall, only a third of UC representatives identified as female.
We’re here to admit that we’re imperfect, but we’re also trying to get better.
The Side by Side campaign itself bears marks of that imperfection—but also of an ongoing process of improvement. Initially, Side by Side was part of the HeForShe campaign, the UN’s global movement to promote gender equality. But as we planned our campaign, we heard growing concerns that “HeForShe” reinforced a pernicious gender binary—the idea that gender only fits neatly into two socially-prescribed boxes.
If a campaign explicitly designed to tackle gender inequities can falter in its own mission, then no one is immune. Only through honest discussion and thoughtful critique can we hope to expose our own missteps and prejudices. We saw the obvious merits of the UN initiative: Men should be included in (but not dominate) the conversation around female empowerment. But we realized that cutting off whole swaths of the human experience in our message was contrary to our ideals, and we decided not to officially endorse the UN affiliated HeforShe brand.
Our Side by Side launch event is Monday, March 2. If you don’t know those words listed at the top, come. If you don’t agree with the words used at the top, come.
Not out of a commitment or opposition to those abstract concepts, but out of the basic human obligation to learn about the living experiences of other people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout this current academic year, sexual assault and the procedural aspects of Harvard’s response to the issue have been featured prominently both nationally and on campus after the University's overhaul of its sexual and gender-based harrassment guidelines.
The new guidelines, which include expanding the jurisdiction of a central investigative office to hear cases of sexual assault across Harvard's schools, represent a step forward. This is not because the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' revised sexual assault policy explicitly bans relationships between professors and students—a fun fact that has occupied much of the national news media's attention—but rather because the University guidelines show Harvard's willingness to comply with Title IX regulations and consider the need for change on campus.
Policy change, however, will not necessarily translate into practical change. For Harvard truly to move toward being a safe space for everyone on campus, students and administrators alike must engage with fighting not just the procedural but also the cultural elements of sexual assault on campus. The onus lies with the students to create a climate where sexual assault is acknowledged and condemned, and where every member of the community is dedicated to speaking up and stepping in.
Creating this climate will take time, and it will take initiatives across the board that facilitate real education and real conversations.
One simple but important measure to help pin down what Harvard must address among students is the sexual assault climate survey the College plans to roll out on April 12. The survey, modified from an Association of American Universities survey, asks students a wide range of questions about sexual misconduct and affirmative consent—a standard we urged be implemented last fall when the revised policies were released. We believe that the information that comes from this survey will not only help deteremine additional policy prescriptions but also act as a gauge to understand the current outlook on campus sexual assault.
Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, who is directing the survey for Harvard’s sexual assault task force, has stated that he expects only 20 to 35 percent of students to respond to the survey, and yet he hopes for a figure closer to 80 percent. Though Laibson’s statement is built on realism, it also paints a deeply disappointing portrait of our student body. Students have an obligation to participate in the survey and encourage others to do the same in hopes that their input may increase the collective understanding about sexual assault and its manifestations at the University.
A shift in procedure will not and cannot end a plague that threatens Harvard and college campuses across the nation. Neither will filling out a simple survey. But at least both measures represent movement forward. How fast we go and how far we get will depend on each individual student recognizing our responsibility to do better on a daily basis. That responsibility is one that should rest heavy on our shoulders, that should follow us into every classroom and every party, and that should not leave our minds until sexual and gender-based harassment and assault are widely discussed, widely denounced, and, we can only hope one day, wholly eradicated.

1) It is my belief that BuzzFeed, the widely panned purveyor of meme culture, meaningless quizzes, and general inanity, is the most effective website on the Internet.
2) Let’s take you as a case study. Do you really care what your favorite Disney princess reveals about you? Is your heart truly warmed by “21 Finger Faces That Are Strangely Heartwarming?” The more you intellectualize BuzzFeed, the more absurd it becomes that the website has attracted over half a billion page views and, by implication, has taken up around half a billion hours (57,039 years!) of human life.
3) And yet—and yet!—BuzzFeed continues to woo hundreds of millions of likeminded people who have no honest interest in “11 Haikus Clearly Written By Dogs” but still click through the links. BuzzFeed “user” is an accurate term.
4) Crack, nicotine, and alcohol are all biologically addictive. They sell themselves. Meanwhile BuzzFeed employees have to work harder to produce a site that lures people to override their better judgment.
5) Buzzfeed’s siren-like ability to suck you in is the product of hours and hours of conscientious design. Look at the front page: Every inch is sculpted to optimize endless procrastination. You can’t scroll to the end of BuzzFeed because as soon you hit the bottom, a new stream of posts appears. The site updates automatically, with new items appearing as notifications. There is a banner of suggested articles, a sidebar of trending items, an adjacent sidebar of news stories, a list of top videos, and, of course, the main stream. How can you gaze at this super-saturation and not find something to click?
6) It takes a psychology degree-and-a-half to explain how this exploding presentation affects your brain. My best guess is that the sheer volume of content overwhelms your critical scrutiny. Might as well click everything in sight, you say. So begins the night of a thousand tabs.
7) If BuzzFeed is a hard drug, then Facebook is clearly the gateway substance. A friend posts a quiz on your wall, and bam, you’re already hooked.
8) Maybe it’s unfair to compare a site that specializes in pictures of puppies to chemicals that have life-ending consequences. In the short term, BuzzFeed can bring joy and satisfaction. (Then again, so can cocaine.) But really, what’s wrong with dedicating half-an-hour every day to laughter?
9) This chain of logic assumes that all pleasure is equally virtuous. The joy you receive from surfing YouTube is not the same as the joy you receive from hearing a friend tell a joke. One type is more permanent and meaningful. On this ladder of pleasure, BuzzFeed exists near the bottom, one rung below deep-fried Oreos. The website is essentially a form of non-sexual porn.
10) Is clicking through BuzzFeed articles a sign of moral decay? Probably not, so long as losing yourself in pages and pages of Jennifer Lawrence coverage doesn’t interfere with important everyday tasks like eating and showering. A certain minute-amount of BuzzFeed is appropriate; a certain minute-amount is not. All users have to discover this razor-thin limit on their own.
11) Does going to Harvard change the above calculation? Now we’ve hit on a more difficult concern, one that transcends the blurry-eyed provinces of the Internet. The question of Harvard students on BuzzFeed is, at its core, an issue of privilege and obligation.
12) Maybe matriculating at Harvard means that you have an increased duty to create value, however you define that phrase. Since opportunities abound here, every minute of Internet procrastination carries extra moral weight.
13) Maybe, on the other hand, insisting that Harvard students have higher standards is an inexcusable act of vanity. Should we assume that kids from other schools have less value-making potential? Why should a flimsy letter of admissions change the expectations that we have for ourselves?
14) Unfortunately, I lack a satisfactory answer. The matter of whether privilege implies obligation is one of the top-three life questions that I still have no idea how to answer. However, I find that the example of procrastination on BuzzFeed at least sums up this conflict in a clear way.
15) What does all this add up to, aside from the number 15? Like BuzzFeed lists themselves, I don’t have a conclusion that wraps a nice bow around the preceding thoughts. Appreciate the hidden cleverness of a website that just debuted an app called “Cute or Not.” Question whether you, as a Harvard student, have an added onus to avoid this app. Beyond that, don’t forget to tune in next week for “Which Letter of the Alphabet are You?” We guarantee your world will never be the same.

On a sunny afternoon in September 2011, for neither the first time nor the last, I was sad. My 17-year-old self curled into a ball on a teal bedspread. Hot tears spilled out as the full weight of an age-old misfortune impressed itself upon me.
My dad moved to North Carolina when I was seven. He had to.
At the time, I understood this development to be temporary. A confluence of bad circumstances was sending my father away, but when he kissed my cheek good-bye, I felt no great sense of sacrifice. With ease I promised that I would not wash that kiss away until he lived in California again.
It’s been 14 years since my dad and I lived in the same state.  At some point I slipped up, and now I don’t even remember with which cheek I break a promise each morning.
Some sorrows hit you all at once. Some accrue slowly. For years, my piano lessons, play dates, and poor grades served as occasions for greater sorrow and rejoicing than did the ticking clock of my father’s lengthening absence.
On one afternoon in September 2011, roughly a decade after my dad’s departure, I took a pause to soak in the meaning of ten years. I could now speak of my childhood in the perfect tense. Day by day for 10 years it had been happening, and now it was done, and he had missed it.
I’m lucky. I did not grow up without a father. Some of you had the pleasure of meeting him this Junior Parents’ Weekend, so you are familiar with the prominent role he plays in my life. But we both grieve a loss of precious time. On that afternoon in September, I lamented the closing of a window, the drying of a sealant in the linear breeze of time.
I share this anecdote simply to say that I think good and soulful things come from moments of drinking in a sad reality.  Sorrow has a way of sticking to your bones and giving structure to your insides. Flying back to school after my grandfather’s funeral, reading Greek after a nasty break-up, sketching the sculpture of a man on a cross. Moments such as these define the depth of my soul.
Despite the usefulness of sorrow, I often find myself seeking to evade it. “If only I knew what I wanted to do with my life, then I wouldn’t have to feel anxious when my parents ask. If only I were married, then I would never feel truly alone.”
When I finally get all that mental squirming over with, my thoughts become much more productive. In the still, small moments alone with my tears, I feel undeniably myself. Who else could I be? Who else within me would volunteer for that sensation?
I encourage you to welcome sorrow wherever it next meets you. Don’t bombard your psyche with the dulling advils for discontent that our generation provides: Hulu, Tinder, Internet porn.
Melancholy provides the occasion for meeting the self. Don’t rob yourself of the opportunity. New insights await, deeper recesses of your soul, truths you will someday jump at the chance to share.
To frame all this in a whisper of warning: If you do not drink in pain when it comes, you will never be equipped to help anyone else in their most dire moments of need.
Indeed, the greatest blessing of pain comes when someone we love is hurting. Only when we seek to comfort a friend do we fully draw upon the reward of every lonely night spent with our unique cocktail of maladies.
That hand you extend—the one with more flesh and bone than a “Get Well Soon” card—is the gift you have purchased for the ones you love by the blood, sweat, and tears of your own personal suffering.

You might call yourself an ally. I certainly do. It’s powerful, and it sends the message that you support a given community. Many say allyship stops there, that speaking up crowds out the voices coming from within that community itself. But can you really be an ally without participating in empowerment?
Harvard Women’s Week 2015 begins today, and I encourage Harvard men to take part in at least one of the many events next week. Calling yourself an ally is commendable, and requires courage. The same goes for calling yourself a feminist. But I hope that the men at this campus will go further, and demonstrate their commitment to equality of the sexes, rather than to simply say it. Show, don’t tell.
To those that believe allyship is about shutting up and listening, I understand where you come from. I, too, believe allies should listen before they speak.  The theme of Women’s Week this year is “I Am Telling My Own Story,” and I wholeheartedly believe men should take this as an opportunity to listen to the stories of the women around them. Effective allyship requires an understanding of the community an ally seeks to support. But to read allyship as just sitting back and listening lets allies off easy. Why should allies be passive, when their action does more for the communities they support?
Men systematically benefit from unconscious and conscious factors in our world. Male voices are heard. Male voices that speak to the virtues of feminism are heard too. Yes, there is always a danger that male voice could overshadow the voices coming from women themselves. But there is also the possibility that the power of an ally’s voice is what it takes to convince another man to see women as equals; men can use power of their voices to break down the very structure that give their voices that power.
For a long time, I didn’t know where the Harvard College Women’s Center was (it’s in the basement of Canaday B entryway). Once I stumbled into it, however, I realized how the center functions not as a space to exclude men, but rather as an environment to celebrate women. All people can join in that celebration. Allies should celebrate women too.
Allyship starts with listening, but it also includes celebration and advocacy. Allies to women can drop by the Women’s Center or participate in a Women’s Week event, of course. Allies of people of color have the Harvard Foundation to look to. Allies of the LGBT community are welcome at the Office of BLGTQ Student Life. But what exactly does celebration and advocacy look like?
It looks like meetings of Harvard Men Against Rape. It looks like attendance of Kuumba and Ghungroo concerts, as well as performance in them. Celebration is when an ally decides to pick up an influential work of black literature. Advocacy is when an ally tells a friend about how many spaces at Harvard are simply inaccessible to disabled students. Allies read and educate themselves to understand how to be the best advocate they can be. And sometimes they even write melodramatic op-eds in their student newspaper.
Women’s Week kicked off on Sunday, and I’m proud to say I will be in attendance. I am excited to hear women at Harvard talk about their experiences, their identities, and their stories. I’ll take note of the challenges they face, the goals they achieved, and the impact they leave. As an ally, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn a little bit more, to listen, and ultimately to take an active role as an advocate of women. Hopefully, I won’t be the only guy in the room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The structure of a concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media to be discussed at the March 3 Faculty meeting features a two-adviser program and required participation in on-campus productions, according to a proposal distributed to members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last week.
It is unlikely that there will be separate tracks in dance and media within the concentration, although the document, which faculty members shared with The Crimson, states that the concentration plans to expand offerings in both subjects. It notes that "most important partner” for developing media courses in particular will be the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies.
The concentration would also require that students participate in training modules on technical aspects of theater and theater labs, which involve working on the technical preparations for concentration productions. All courses and productions will be open to non-concentrators, except for sophomore and junior tutorials, according to the current proposal.
Coursework would emphasize both the scholarly study of theater and its practice, according to the Faculty meeting document. In light of this two-pronged emphasis, concentrators will likely receive two advisers, one focusing on practice-based courses and the other on critical and historical ones.
The document also states that affiliates from VES and the Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts, which has developed the concentration proposal, have begun discussing “a joint concentration in performance and media.” Members of the VES faculty have been invited to join the governing committee in an effort to facilitate access by Theater, Dance, and Media to VES courses and resources and access by VES to courses on directing, acting, and scenography.
In addition to completing 11 half-courses in different areas of theater studies, concentrators would also be required to participate in two productions run by the concentration and two additional shows that can be run by an extracurricular group such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, according to the Faculty meeting document.
If approved by the Faculty, the current proposal would require that concentrators study non-Western and “non-traditional” theater and dance by the time they graduate.
Advisers would typically be members of the concentration’s governing committee, which would be known as the Standing Committee on Theater, Dance, and Media. This committee would emerge from a restructuring of the Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts, which currently administers the secondary field in Dramatic Arts. The restructuring would go into effect on July 1.
While the secondary field would be renamed “Theater, Dance, and Media,” its requirements would remain unchanged, according to the document. The concentration will likely be housed in Farkas Hall and be responsible for running the space.
The Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts is currently chaired by English professor Martin Puchner, who has led the development of Theater, Dance, and Media since the committee began discussing preliminary ideas in 2011. University officials first announced the proposed concentration in October 2014.
Puchner will present the details of the proposal at the Faculty meeting. The Faculty are expected to vote on the concentration proposal at their subsequent meeting on April 7, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. If approved, the concentration would begin to offer courses in the fall of 2015 and allow undergraduates to declare in December. University President Drew G. Faust has allocated $5 million dollars from her discretionary funds to help launch the concentration.

A proposed concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media would draw heavily from existing resources, using current teaching staff and curricula from across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and outside groups.
Since there currently exists a Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts and a secondary field in Dramatic Arts, the architects of the new concentration will not have to build up a course list from scratch.
A document proposing the concentration, to be presented to the Faculty at their monthly meeting on Tuesday, emphasizes “the feasibility of the proposed concentration,” and includes a compilation of courses offered by or cross-registered with the Standing Committee on Dramatic Arts over the past seven years.
According to assistant professor of English Derek Miller, the "course offerings in Theater, Dance, and Media next year after the concentration starts, assuming it gets approved, will not look significantly different than how they’ve looked over the past two years, except you will now be able to concentrate in it.”
“We’ve long been aware of the wide array of courses offered in this area in all kinds of departments,” he added.
The proposal document states the intent to establish cross-departmental relationships with several FAS departments, including English, Music, and History of Art and Architecture, as well as the Graduate School of Design.
“It's going to be getting everyone here working in dramatics now brought together under a firmer home base, plus new hires,” said Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division.
The new concentration will be careful to avoid being designated a conservatory, Sorensen said. While students would be required to participate in department productions, theater labs, and technical training modules, in-classroom courses would maintain a more traditional learning environment.
“[The concentration] integrates the academic study of theater, the history of theater, and theater as a genre with hands on production,” Sorensen said. “It brings the two together and that means that it’s still part of the liberal arts, but it puts the production and the acting and the staging in deep dialogue with learning about theater the way you would learn about the novel or the lyric.”
The concentration plans to have a semesterly or yearly culminating performances created, directed, and performed largely by Theater, Dance, and Media concentrators, according to English professor Martin Puchner, the concentration’s chief architect. He added that many other classes would incorporate smaller performance aspects in their final projects or daily class meetings, but will not require a main stage.
For performances, the concentration would likely utilize existing spaces, offered by the American Repertory Theater, as well as the organizational structures of on-campus theater groups like the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, according to the proposal.
“My students have been very enthusiastic,” Ryan S. McKittrick '98, director of artistic Programs/dramaturg at the American Repertory Theater, wrote in an emailed statement. “The A.R.T. has shared the Loeb Drama Center spaces with undergraduates for more than 25 years and will continue to do so as the concentration develops.”
The potential marriage of previously divorced academic and extracurricular offerings in theater offers great promise, according to Sorensen.
“We think one of the great aspects of the concentration is that there will be a real grounding so there can be greater integration, and the extracurricular and the curricular can come into better conversations,” Sorensen said. “The details have to be sorted out, but the idea is to be inclusive.”

Photography, large portraits, gold-leafed basketballs, and other pieces of art stretched across the walls and surroundings of 29 Garden St. last Friday, marking the kickoff of the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College’s 17th annual Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival.
This year, Kuumba chose the theme “Reflections on Freedom” after considering other options such as joy, struggle, and love last spring, according to Cherline Bazile ’17, the chair of the festival.
Consistent throughout various short presentations was an emphasis on the representation of black artists and culture in classes, museums, and the broader media.
“Often, black people feel like there’s something that’s given to them, so it’s a very different thing to carve out this space and be like ‘here’s your space to create, here’s your space to be free without these stereotypes,’” Bazile said.
Multiple artists, photographers, and sculptors from Rhode Island to Georgia gave brief addresses to expand on the inspiration behind their work. Many were attracted to the event after the "I, Too, Am Harvard" campaign hosted a conference last fall.
Some art directly alluded to perceived racism in the criminal justice system in the aftermath of two separate non-indictments of white police officers who each killed an unarmed black man last year.
Nafis M. White, a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, displayed two pieces in the exhibition, one of which was a neon sign that glowed with the phrase “Can I Get A Witness?” Accompanying the display was an elongated list—several sheets of paper long—on which she printed names of those whom police officers had killed in recent years, according to White.
White also presented a display of 10 basketballs which she had wrapped in gold leaf to convey a message about the perceived commodification of black basketball players and the discrimination they may face when off the court.
Many of those who organized or displayed art spoke highly of the collection, highlighting that events showcasing black art are uncommon.
“It’s so strong because we rarely have this kind of filling of a space for people who have so many things to say,” White said.
Cecilia B. Sanders ’16, the co-chair of the festival, pointed to the power of the collection of art in speaking to larger issues of race-related activism.
“Their vision collectively has created this interesting patchwork that’s better than anything that we could have planned or prompted,” Sanders said.
Other festival programming in the next several days will include a panel discussion on social consciousness in black art, vocal performances, and a benefit concert whose proceeds will be directed towards the creation of a scholarship fund for music lessons, according to the group’s website.

Undergraduates would be required to make an affirmation of integrity when they register and be asked to do so during final exams and on final papers and projects—including theses—should members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approve proposed legislation on the College’s first-ever honor code.
In addition to these requirements, faculty members would be “encouraged to ask students to affirm their awareness of the Honor Code on assignments when appropriate” when the honor code goes into effect in the fall of 2015, according to the document, which was distributed to faculty members last week.
The document, dated Feb. 13, does not offer a standardized affirmation of integrity for the entire College, but offers a suggested statement for faculty use: “I attest to the honesty of my academic work and affirm that it conforms to the standards of the Harvard College Honor Code.”
The Faculty is expected to vote on the affirmation statement in April, ahead of the honor code's implementation, which will create a new student-faculty judicial body to hear cheating cases and overhaul the College's approach to handling academic dishonesty.
Incoming freshmen would also be required to submit a “brief personal response” expressing their reflections on the College’s honor code after they accept their offer to attend the College, according to a version of the proposal to be presented at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting that faculty members shared with The Crimson. These individual responses, which students would discuss with their Peer Advising Fellows or academic advisers, would be available for students to view periodically during their time at Harvard.
At the end of each semester during reading period, all undergraduates will receive an email about the honor code, which would include their personal statement “if possible."
In 2015, sophomores would also be required to respond to a prompt asking them to give advice to freshmen about academic integrity based on experiences they had during their first year at Harvard.
Freshman resident deans would also discuss academic integrity and the honor code at Harvard in their regular speeches during freshman orientation.
Business School researchers who study similar types of affirmation in academics and professional life were consulted during the drafting of the proposal, according to the document.
The full FAS faculty approved the honor code in May 2014 and specified that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana would “bring to the Faculty Council a recommendation regarding the nature and frequency” of the affirmation, which was the subject of faculty debate last spring. However, at the Faculty Council’s meeting on Feb. 11, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris brought such recommendations to the group for vote on behalf of the Committee on Academic Integrity, Harris wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas shared his experience as an undocumented immigrant from the Philippines and argued for the need for more open conversation about racial equality and immigration at an Askwith Forum on Friday. The talk also served as the keynote address for the 13th annual Alumni of Color Conference.
Vargas, also a filmmaker and the founder of a campaign called “Define American,” is a well-known immigration activist.
According to Mark Nelson, a committee co-lead of Communications and Publications for the AOCC, the steering committee invited Vargas to speak at the conference as part of this year’s theme “The Other Narrative: Celebrating Untold Stories.”
Vargas began with an anecdote about how his grandparents paid $3,500 to smuggle him out of the Philippines with a fake green card. He spoke about his struggle to understand his identity as an undocumented gay immigrant.
Vargas also discussed how he became recognized through his journalistic work and writing. He said that he continues to travel across the country, delivering speeches and making documentaries as part of “Define American,” a media and culture campaign that aims to shift perspectives on citizenship and immigration in the United States.
Vargas criticized what he described as the general public’s refusal to acknowledge undocumented immigrants as citizens while profiting from their cheap labor.
“You know that without us, you wouldn’t have lettuce and tomatoes. Who would babysit your kids? Who would mow your lawns?” he said.“The actual narrative is, without our money into your fund, it would go bankrupt. And you have the audacity to call us illegal and say get out of here?”
Although he said that he sometimes wonders why he chooses to stay in a country that he argued does not want him, Vargas said that he continues his work on encouraging undocumented immigrants to share their stories. According to Vargas, these narratives are an important part of the American identity.
“Individually and collectively, [their] coming out is tied to the story of America,” he said.
He ended his address with three questions for the audience to mull over: “Where did you come from, how did you get here, and who paid?”
Vargas’s address was part of a two-day conference at the Graduate School of Education dealing with issues of race, class, and education.
Jackie I. Iloh, one of the tri-chairs of AOCC 2015, referred to the keynote address as “an opportunity to engage a large crowd at one time around our theme.” She said there are over 200 presenters, ranging from youth to researchers, at the conference.
Nelson said the conference allows students and attendees to look at “how we as students that are going into the education field can make an impact that works towards justice and equity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of 10 representatives from different student groups agreed that there is no one definition of feminism at a “Meet the Feminists” event Saturday afternoon.
The panel, organized by feminist undergraduate group the Radcliffe Union of Students, was followed by a campus feminism fair that featured more than 15 undergraduate organizations.
Caroline Light, director of undergraduate studies for Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, moderated the panel discussion, which included speakers from the Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service, Science Club for Girls, and Women in Business, among other groups that self-identified as feminist.
Kara J. W. Lessin ’16, campus and community relations chair for the Radcliffe Union of Students, said she conceived of the event as a means of facilitating communication between these student groups.
“Just having conversations is the most important thing,” Lessin said. “There are so many different identities, and I think that having separate spaces for those is really important, but collaboration is the main thing, and that’s what Harvard is about.”
Lessin said she was interested in learning about reasons for disagreement between groups who share common interests.
“As far as I know, in my memory, this is the first time that we’ve kind of actively tried to have a discussion that crosses all of these different boundaries and tried to get at the heart of where we intersect and where we diverge,” she said.
Light opened the discussion by asking the panel for their definitions of feminism. The panelists’ responses represented their personal definitions, and they varied greatly across the 10 speakers.
Kim E. Reimold ’16, co-director of Science Club for Girls, said the focus for her group was less on philosophy and more on practical goals. Science Club for Girls is an organization that works to demonstrate and foster leadership skills and promote continued studies of science and technology among young girls, according to its website.
“It's hard to communicate to little girls what feminism is, so we focus on talking about ‘girl stuff’ and being with them as mentors,” Reimold said.
Kirin Gupta '16, co-director of the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective, said she thought of feminism as “the struggle for liberation from the way that power is structured through the construction of gender.”
Given the event’s timing, which coincided with Junior Parents' Weekend, the audience included parents as well as students.

The Undergraduate Council will roll out a pilot program that will integrate the functions of Harvard IDs and MBTA CharlieCards, representatives said at their general meeting Sunday.
The Council will be partnering with the Harvard Office for Sustainability and Harvard Transportation and Parking to insert CharlieCard chips to be inserted into undergraduate HUIDs. The pilot program, set to begin later this month, will give 100 students the integrated cards preloaded with $50.
The program’s ultimate goal is to allow students to travel into the greater Boston area in a way that is both efficient and sustainable, according to Rhea Malik ’17.
Malik, who assisted in developing the technology, said at the meeting that if successful, the HUID-CharlieCard integration pilot program will demonstrate student behavior patterns, such as how often students ride the T and the stations that they frequent. With this data, the Council intends to convince administrators to expand the program and ultimately introduce integrated HUIDs to all undergraduates.
“With continued support from the UC, we can shape University policy and have this kind of technology available for the entire school,” Malik said.
Malik partnered with UC Student Life Committee Chair Oliver W. Kim ’16 in developing and launching the pilot program. Kim is a Crimson editorial writer.
The Council passed three pieces of legislation at Sunday’s meeting.
In one act, the Council agreed to release a position paper on the College’s Program in General Education. According to the resolution, the paper will compile and analyze the results of a UC-run, College-wide survey on the Gen Ed program, as well as discussions from several town hall meetings. The position paper will come as a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee continues its review of the Gen Ed program.
The UC also voted to budget close to $3,000 for its gender equity campaign launch event.
Several Council members posed challenges to the budgeting act, arguing that it took too large a portion of funds from the Student Relations Committee. According to Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, the committee’s annual budget is $1,500 for the year. The act sought to allocate $1,350 from that budget to the launch event.
“I don’t really understand why this is part of the SRC budget, because it doesn’t seem to me like a Student Relations Committee project,” said Levine, who is also a Crimson news writer. “This wasn’t docketed by SRC, which means that I, as an SRC member, didn’t see it until an hour ago.”
Despite its opposition by some in the Council, the act passed unanimously with three abstentions.
The Council also allocated more than $8,500 in grants to student groups.

Members of the University Benefits Committee and Harvard Benefits held the first of three planned information sessions on the 2015 University healthcare plan Friday afternoon, according to an announcement emailed to faculty and non-union staff.
The closed event, hosted at the Center for Workplace Development on Mount Auburn Street, featured a question-and-answer session with UBC affiliates.
University administrators formally announced changes to the University healthcare plan for faculty and nonunion staff last September, citing the burden of rising healthcare costs. The plan consisted of reduced premiums and also introduced deductibles for the first time, which faced controversy when professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously passed a motion in November to ask the Harvard Corporation to reverse the changes. In response, University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a community-wide letter that the University would keep the changes but would also establish a fund to mitigate cost increases for some employees and explore alternative plan designs for the future.
“For the 2016 plan, we are looking at a lot of different options, and the president asked us to look into whether we should also offer a tiered network product,” Robert C. Clark, former dean of the Law School and current UBC member, said after the information session. “It adds another level complexity because we are not sure if the products we could get are good.”
Clark also said that the UBC is considering a limited-network plan, similar to the program that he experienced while a professor at Yale, that restricts patient choice of provider but could potentially cover more services.
“It’s all simple...but you can only go to this or that hospital,” said Clark. “It costs more, but it covers a lot of stuff.”
The next two information sessions will be held on March 16 and March 20 in Longwood and Cambridge, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a night where tipoff was delayed 15 minutes by Columbia’s Senior Day ceremonies, it was Harvard’s original class of 2015 that shined strongest. In the Crimson’s bounce-back 80-70 victory over Columbia (13-13, 5-7 Ivy), the recruiting class had all but 17 points.
Leading the charge were the usual suspects. Senior wing Wesley Saunders put on a show, scoring 21 points on just eight shots, adding five assists and four rebounds. Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi had arguably his best game of the season, making all but three shots en route to 17 points and 11 rebounds.
“Steve is a senior and he is player like a senior,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. ‘That’s the biggest compliment I can give to a veteran senior.”
PROVIDING THE POP
It wasn’t only the starters for the Crimson (20-6, 10-2 Ivy). Off the bench, senior bigs Kenyatta Smith and Jonah Travis had 11 points in just 28 combined minutes, giving their customary lift.
The story of the night, however, was the only member of the recruiting class not currently in his final year—sophomore Corbin Miller. The Sandy, Utah native, who took two years off to complete a missions trip, has returned this year as an integral part of the rotation. Arguably the best shooter on the team, he is certainly the most prolific.
On Saturday, with the team’s lead in danger, he did what shooters do best: catch fire.
The first three pushed the lead to 11. A Columbia timeout didn’t solve matters, as Lions coach Kyle Smith stayed in a zone, daring Miller to beat him again.
The sophomore was happy to oblige, nailing another trey. Expression unchanged, he did it again the next possession, causing the TV announcer to exclaim that he was seeing shades of Reggie Miller in the gymnasium.
“We have the utmost confidence in Corbin and we want him to take shots because when he makes them our team is completely different,” Saunders said. “He just had a great game.”
LO AND BEHOLD
On defense, Harvard came out strong. The Lions had just five points in the game’s first seven-and-a-half minutes, with three turnovers before they made their first basket.
Then Columbia junior Maodo Lo got started. The league’s leading scorer torched the Crimson for 22 points in Cambridge two weeks ago, but made the effort look routine in averaging 26.5 a game last weekend—setting the record for made field goals in the Pizzitola Sports Center in a 35-point outburst at Brown.
Lo was in double-digits by halftime and finished with 33 for the game. He made 13-of-21 field goals, routinely cutting through the defense for layups and beating defenders—namely Saunders and junior Agunwa Okolie—on backdoor cuts.
“He was definitely in attack mode tonight but I tried to do as much as possible,” Saunders said. “It was a team effort to guard him and I didn’t want to focus on offense. I knew tonight would be on our offense and stopping Lo. I didn’t do the best of jobs but it was enough to get the win.”
“Like I said before, he’s terrific,” Amaker added. “He’s quick, he’s shifty with the ball, his head is up, he’s low on his drives, and he can shoot the ball well behind the three-point line. He’s hard for anyone.”
SATURDAY NIGHTS
The Crimson’s bounce-back win was the fifth time this season that Harvard has followed up a loss with a win. Under Amaker, who is fond of saying that the league is won on Saturday nights, Harvard has suffered just one pair of back-to-back league losses over the last three seasons—a stunning sweep by Penn and Princeton in March 2013.
“We always talk about turning the page,” Saunders said. “We knew this was a big moment and a big time for our team. We knew that Columbia wasn’t going to feel sorry for us and we would have to come out and battle. It is a testament to our team and our resolve and I think the way we have been all year in bouncing back and not getting too down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior Shilpa Tummala drove with the ball into traffic. A swarm of Columbia players attacked. Co-captain Erin McDonnell was wide open.
She caught the ball about two feet behind the arc, squared to the hoop, and released.
It was nothing but net.
“I realized I was open and I was like, ‘Oh wow, I’m open,'” McDonnell said. “Shilpa drove because she always draws a lot of defenders…I started screaming and she heard me, and I was just lucky enough that it went in.”
The trey would put the Crimson (12-14, 5-7 Ivy) ahead, with the score at 82-81 with just under a minute to go, a lead the team would never relinquish. As the clock expired following a missed jumper by Lions’ sophomore Tori Oliver, the Harvard bench cleared with each member of the Crimson cheering in excitement.
With the level of intensity and heart shown by Harvard and Columbia (8-18, 2-10) in this game, one would expect there was a title or a playoff spot on the line, but that wasn’t the case. Though the game saw two sub-.500 Ivy teams facing off, the Crimson women didn’t take this game lightly.
“Our seniors have made a giant commitment and worked so hard for four years that this was a special night for them,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It doesn’t matter who our opponent was I think they were just going to play hard.”
The Crimson was celebrating senior night—honoring the play of the team’s four members of the class of 2015. McDonnell, fellow co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins, forward Temi Fagbenle, and guard Ali Curtis were playing their final game at Lavietes Pavilion, but they certainly made it count.
McDonnell finished the game with 15 points, her 23rd game this season she reached double figures. She shot 5-for-8 from the field, including 3-of-4 from behind the arc, but no shot was more important than that final three.
Fagbenle added 16 on the night to move to 15th on the all-time Crimson scoring list with 1,121 points. The senior got a standing ovation from the crowd when she fouled out of the game with just under two minutes to go in the contest.
In a scrappy game that was played with high intensity from the first whistle to the last, Dinkins was part of a strong defensive core, covering some of the Lions' hot shooters in the backcourt. She added two steals for Harvard in 20 minutes on the court.
Curtis saw limited action in her first game since returning from injury. The guard contributed three points and two assists in 11 minutes.
The last time the Crimson faced Columbia, Harvard fell by a score of 59-43. This time out, however, was a much different scenario, as the Crimson matched their total score from the first meeting in the first half alone.
“I am so proud of this team for how tough they played,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought Columbia played far better than I thought they would. I think [there was a] 'Lets beat Harvard twice’ kind of mentality.”
Much of the difference came from the performance of the Harvard role players who stepped up on Saturday.
Coming off the bench, Tummala and junior guard Kit Metoyer, who had been starting with the recent absence of Curtis, added 15 and 10 points, respectively.
On the Lions' side, two rookie players stood out and carried their team to hold the lead for almost 28 minutes of play. Freshmen guard Alexa Giuliano lit up Lavietes during the first half, hitting five consecutive three-pointers. Giuliano holds the Columbia record for most threes in a season, and after hitting eight total on Saturday night, also claimed the record for most threes in a game. She had 24 points on the night. Classmate Camille Zimmerman added 25 points of her own.
“They set a lot of player screens for [Giuliano] and I think we were late for those switches so we made an adjustment for the guard to just get around it and be expecting that,” McDonnell said.
A distinct height advantage helped the Crimson dominate the paint through most of the night. Harvard outscored the Lions 36-26 in the paint with 21 second chance points on the night compared to Columbia’s 12. Fagbenle and junior AnnMarie Healy controlled the pace down low, with a combined 19 rebounds.
Healy also added a huge block during the Lion’s possession following McDonnell’s lead clinching three with just about thirty seconds to go to put the game in the Crimson’s hands, rather than it becoming a must-score situation that Harvard has found itself in on many occasions this season.
Though the team has had ups and downs, this game was an important one for the seniors that stepped on the floor at Lavietes Pavilion, and Delany-Smith wanted her players to channel that emotion in the game.
“[I told them to] have emotion,” Delany-Smith said. “Take some of the emotion and turn it into energy, and I think that’s what we saw and that’s what they did. I felt good that this team was going to find a way to win.”

In its last race of the season, the Harvard ski team put on one of its strongest performances of the season, placing 10th in the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Regional Championships at Lake Placid, N.Y. over the weekend. The team totaled 303 points over the weekend, with a particularly strong performance from the Nordic team, which placed no lower than eighth in any event.
As a follow-up to his impressive sixth place finish just two weeks ago at Dartmouth, Captain Akeo Maifeld-Carucci notched another top-15 performance, finishing in 14th place with a time of 1:02:04.4 at the 20K Classic race on Saturday following a 22nd-place finish on Friday during the 10K Freestyle race. He contributed 53 points over the weekend, securing his spot in the NCAA Championships, which will take place two weeks from now.
Maifeld-Carucci wasn’t the only Harvard athlete to have a strong performance, as the squad impressed throughout the weekend. Sophomore Ian Meyer came in at 22nd with a time of 1:03:55 followed by junior Soren Anderson, who came in 33rd, pacing the race in 1:05:25.3 in Saturday’s 20K Classic race. Behind them, sophomore Devlin Shea came in at 38th with freshman Connor Green and classmate Haakon Sigurslid finishing 53rd and 56th, respectively. The men’s nordic squad contributed more than a third of Harvard’s points over the weekend.
“Just overall, we had people skiing their best races ever, and a lot of them by not even a small margin, but skiing their best results by a large margin,” said Crimson nordic coach Chris City. “It was a really great way to end the season.”
The nordic women had an equally strong weekend, totaling 64 points on Saturday and 53 on Friday. Sophomore Rachel Hampton had another standout performance, coming in 14th in the 15K Classic with a time of 55:47.3—this was her third top-25 performance this season, which solidified her berth to the NCAA Championships.
Hampton wasn’t alone in the top-25 for the 15K Classic, as she was followed by junior Annie Harvieux in 21st with a time of 57:08, and sophomore Maile Sapp, whose time of 57:52.7 was good for 25th.
“I definitely had a rough patch at the middle of the season, but I feel like with this weekend I can definitely compete with some of the best skiers in the nation,” Hampton said.
While Maifeld-Carucci and Hampton are moving on to NCAAs in two weeks, the season has ended for the rest of the squad, but City expressed optimism in the team going forward.
“I’m really pleased with the season,” City said. “I thought it was really successful, and we saw a lot of really good skiing, so I’m excited going into next year.”
On the alpine side, freshman Kelly Steeves was the only female skier remaining for the Crimson on Saturday, following the injury of junior alpine skier Samantha Udolf on Friday’s giant slalom. Steeves gave another solid performance, placing 21st on Friday’s giant slalom with a total time of 2:15.58. The rookie built upon Friday’s run, placing 32nd on Saturday’s slalom with a combined time of 2:01.67. Steeves contributed 16 points on Saturday alone.
Despite being plagued by injuries for the last few carnivals, the men’s alpine team put on a strong performance, particularly on Saturday’s slalom. Freshman Pieter Weemaes led Harvard with a 37th place finish and a total time of 2:02.5, following a rough second run in the Giant Slalom the day before. Weemaes was followed by junior captain Simon Merryweather in 42nd with a time of 2:05.63. Sophomore James Stevenson and junior Dan Rittenhouse closed out the race for the Crimson with 44th and 45th place finishes, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 2, 2015, at 8:00 p.m.
The Harvard women’s squash team (13-1, 6-1 CSA) sent three players to the CSA Individual Championships this weekend at Princeton's Jadwin Squash Courts. In the end, one came out a national champion.
Senior Amanda Sobhy, the top-ranked player in the country, became the second player in tournament history to win four straight Ramsay Cup titles. The only other person to achieve the same feat was the woman whom the cup is named after, Gail Ramsay, who won the title four times at Penn State from 1977-1980.
“There was a lot of stress put on me,” Sobhy said. “I tried not to think about it too much, and I just told myself to go out there and enjoy my game and treat it like any other match.”
Sobhy, who finishes her collegiate career without a single loss, wrapped up the season with a 10-0 record in team competition, never losing a single game in any of those matches.
That would change in the individual finals, but Sobhy did not let it phase her.
The senior faced off against Trinity junior Kanzy El-Defrawy for the third time this season in the championship match. In their previous two meetings, Sobhy had swept El-Defrawy. This time around, though, El-Defrawy took the first game, 11-9, after the pair traded leads multiple times. This was the only game Sobhy lost in the match—and the only game in her tournament run.
“I think I performed alright given how nervous I was,” Sobhy said. “Kanzy played the best she has ever played against me, so she made me work really hard the entire match. As the match progressed though, I think I got stronger and more relaxed.”
Sobhy started off the second match behind, trailing, 5-4. From there, though, she went on a 4-0 run and went on to win the game, 11-6. She commanded the next game, never relinquishing her early lead, and won, 11-6.
The fourth game started out close, but Sobhy broke away in the middle of the game to take the lead. She only gave up one point after taking the lead, winning the game, 11-5, thus putting the cap on her historic career.
The first game of the semifinals against Princeton rookie Olivia Fietcher also proved to be challenging for Sobhy. In it, the senior battled to a 11-9 win. The four-time reigning champion did not allow the second and third matches to be so close, definitively winning the next two games, 11-2, 11-3. Paired with an earlier win over Penn sophomore Anaka Alankamony in the quarterfinals, Saturday's performance propelled Sobhy into the final round for the fourth consecutive year, providing her the chance to become the second player in history to win four titles.
On Friday, Sobhy finished with two wins. She defeated Yale freshman Jennifer Davis in a sweep in the Round of 32. She only dropped three points in the match, winning all three games by a score of 11-1.
Sobhy also had a sweep against Bulldog senior Shihui Mao later in the day in the Round of 16. She took the first two games by a wide margin, 11-5, 11-4. The last game was longer, but Sobhy topped Mao, 11-7.
“I loved my collegiate experience and being on that team aspect and I think my game has definitely matured over the past four years.” Sobhy said. “I'm looking forward to what the future has in store for me on the pro tour.”
Freshman Alyssa Mehta and junior Michelle Gemmell, who amassed a combined 23-4 record in team play, also vied for the Ramsay Cup over the weekend. Sobhy, however, was the only one of the three Crimson competitors to advance to the quarterfinals.
“I was a bit nervous, but after such a successful season with my team, I felt confident,” Mehta said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a title is on the line, the performances from the regular season fade into the shadows. Though the hours of training are crucial, in swimming, it all comes down to the final days of competition to determine a champion.
For the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (9-0, 7-0 Ivy), regular season successes weren’t enough for the group to claim the Ivy title for the second year in a row. The men finished second behind host Princeton, finishing with 1285.5 points, while the Tigers claimed the title with a total of 1519 points.“Princeton swam lights out, so you’ve got to hand it to them,” co-captain Michael Gaudiani said. “They had an incredible meet.”
The Tigers left a wake in their path that no team could overcome, as they dominated all three days of competition in their home pool. They took an early lead on day one that created an uphill battle for the remaining seven teams throughout the subsequent two days of competition.
“I thought we performed well as a team,” co-captain Griffin Schumacher said. “Obviously we weren’t completely satisfied with the outcome, but sometimes some of the most difficult meets are where you learn the most.”
Coming into the weekend with an undefeated regular season record, the Crimson had high expectations for this meet. The team was coming off a close HYP sweep, where they defeated now-champion Princeton by a narrow margin of only 27 points. Harvard had nearly a month off from competition between the meets, but did not let its training slow down.
“We were just simulating races every day in practice so we would have mock meets and different sets that were designed to emulate the competition environment,” Schumacher said.
The Crimson’s top performer of the meet was senior diver Mike Mosca. Mosca was the one competitor that no other team could touch, as he swept both the one-meter and three-meter events. He became the third ever Ivy competitor to sweep both the one-meter and three-meter at an Ivy Championship.
With his one-meter victory, the Tenafly, N.J. native became the first Ivy League diver to ever win the one-meter Ivy title all four years of competition. He claimed the title this year with a score of 368.05, just one point shy of the meet record, of which he already holds. On day three when Mosca competed in the three-meter event, he finished with a score of 457.35, a new meet record. Though they may not have been first to touch the wall in their events, many other Crimson swimmers contributed strong individual performances to keep Harvard in second position.
Sophomore Jack Manchester continued his whirlwind season, as he set a trio of records with his preliminary swim in the 200 backstroke. His time of 1:41.44 was enough to write his name atop the Ivy League, meet, and pool record books. He fell, however, in the final race when Yale swimmer Rob Harder beat him to the finish by less than a half of a second.
On day two of the contest, sophomore Max Yakubovich was the top Crimson finisher, as he took second in the 100 fly with a time of 46.88.
Though Princeton swept each of the relay events, Harvard’s 200 free relay combination of sophomore Paul O’Hara, freshman Steven Tan, Yakubovich, and Schumacher were a bright point for the relays as they finished second with a time of 1:18.76. Though the foursome finished faster than expected based on their seed time, they faced off against a Princeton group that set a new meet record with a time of 1:17.35.
The Crimson will graduate 13 seniors from the current roster, but showed the depth of their team this year in the championship meet.
“I definitely could be happier if we won,” Gaudiani said. “That’s a goal for next year and we would definitely like to train even harder and use this as motivation for next year’s training group. We have a young team right now and we had some great culture this year. Keep that up and it should go our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With snow piled high on the winter streets of Cambridge, the No. 10/13 Harvard men’s lacrosse team traveled south to Durham, N.C., but did not find a warm reception waiting for them from No. 6/6 Duke. Strong shooting helped the defending national champions stretch a two-goal halftime lead into a seven-goal margin of victory, 21-14.
Three goals late in the second quarter cut the Crimson’s halftime deficit to two goals allowed Harvard to stick around in the game. But Duke put a stop to the Crimson’s hopes, winning the third quarter, 4-2, and then dominating the fourth quarter by a 7-4 margin.
“They’re always a tough team,” co-captain Jake Gambitsky said. “Coming off a national championship, we knew we were going to get a really good team this year. They lost some good guys from last year, some All-Americans…but they’ve reloaded.”
The Blue Devils dominated play on the ground. Duke was able to out-groundball Harvard 55-29, gaining far more scoring opportunities and possessions on the way to its victory. This included dominating at the faceoff, where the Blue Devils managed to take 27 of the 39 possessions following restarts.
“They were better than us on ground balls,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “When you tilt the balance of possession and time of possession in a team like that’s favor, you’re just not going to win the game.”
At the start of the game, the two teams went back and forth, neither able to take an early definitive lead. The Blue Devils opened the scoring less than a minute into the game, but the Crimson bounced back, as junior attackman Devin Dwyer and senior midfielder Philip Wagley notched back-to-back scores.
That was the last time that Harvard would lead in the game.
“We made a number of mental mistakes,” Wojcik said. “And whenever you do that, Duke capitalizes.”
The Blue Devils rallied back to take control, scoring three unanswered goals, and then one more after junior attackman Will Walker scored for the Crimson.
Duke then started the second quarter off strong, going on a 5-2 run to take a commanding five-goal lead with only four minutes left in the half.
But Harvard bounced back again, as junior midfielder Keegan Michel and junior attackmen Ian Ardrey and Deke Burns all scored within the last two minutes to bring the lead back to within two going into halftime.
Duke scored right at the outset of the third quarter, but then were held scoreless by the Crimson for nearly nine minutes, its longest dry-spell of the game, before matching a goal from Harvard’s freshman midfielder Joe Lang and another from Walker with three of their own.
Burns brought it back within three for the Crimson at the start of the fourth quarter, but after that it was all Blue Devils, as the defending national champions went on a 7-3 run to end the game. Sophomore midfielder Matt Ryan, freshman attackman Tim Edmonds, and Dwyer each scored for Harvard, but their efforts were too little, too late.
During the fourth quarter, Duke won 17 ground balls to the Crimson’s seven, and took 18 shots to Harvard’s six as a result en route to a 21-14 finish.
“We had opportunities to compete,” Gambitsky said. “But we just didn’t execute as well as we wanted to and they went on a run at the end. We’re looking forward though. This was a tough game against one of the top teams in the country, and we’re confident we can continue to get better and learn. We’re looking confident we can rebound against Quinnipiac on Tuesday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took a true team effort for the Crimson to take down the Big Red.
With four players scoring in double figures, the Harvard women’s basketball team was able to take down Cornell. Despite seeing 12 lead changes throughout the contest, a three-point basket by co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins with just under 12 minutes to go in the second half gave the Crimson a lead it would never relinquish.
After returning from a four-game road trip during which the team went 1-3, Harvard (11-14, 4-7 Ivy), defeated the Big Red (15-10, 6-5) by a score of 60-54 on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The win allowed the Crimson to hold on to its undefeated 34-0 record against Cornell at home.
“We were like, 'Guys this is our stomping ground,'” co-captain Erin McDonnell said. “We love playing here in Lavietes, and this is our home, so let's just take it to these two teams and get two big victories in a row.”
The win set Harvard up to win its first back-to-back Ivy contests this season. Plagued by injuries and inconsistency, the team has dropped many close games throughout the season.
“We hadn’t [won back to back games], so there was a big question mark in my mind on if we were healthy enough and tough enough to do it,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
The last time the two Ancient Eight foes faced off, the Crimson held on for a close 61-57 win on Feb. 14.  With the Big Red being held to just 33 percent shooting, Harvard was able to claim victory behind 17 points from McDonnell and a strong performance by junior Kit Metoyer.
Similar to the shooting woes that Cornell faced the first time it faced the Crimson this season, the visitors were kept to just 36 percent shooting from the field. Harvard also held its Ancient Eight foe to just nine attempts from the free throw line. With the Crimson committing just 11 fouls in the contest, the Big Red was forced to earn nearly ever basket the hard way.
Cornell forward Nia Marshall, who put up 27 points on Harvard the first time around, was held to just nine points on 4-for-12 shooting.
The Crimson got off to a bit of a slow start, entering the break down four, but a second-half turnaround where it outscored the Big Red, 37-27, was enough for Harvard to end up on top. In past games Delaney-Smith has cited slow starts as a major factor in the demise of the Crimson in close losses, but it was a struggle the team was able to overcome this week.
McDonnell played an essential role in the second half turnaround, with all 15 of her points coming in the second frame. She shot 6-for-7 during the 20-minute period, setting the tempo for a 16-4 run by Harvard to seal the victory.
Once again, the Crimson’s inside game was a force to be reckoned with. Harvard came out on top in rebounding and second chance points, led by senior Temi Fagbenle and junior AnnMarie Healy.
Each member of the frontcourt duo contributed 11 points. Fagbenle recorded her 11th double-double of the season as she added 11 rebounds, while Healy was close behind with nine boards.
Turnovers plagued the Harvard offense as it gave up the ball 15 times over the course of 40 minutes, while the Big Red only coughed it up seven times. A trio of Cornell starters had two steals apiece to slow some of the Harvard momentum throughout the contest.
With senior guard Ali Curtis, who averages nearly 28 minutes per game, out of the lineup due to an injury, the backcourt combination of juniors Shilpa Tummala and Metoyer has been running much of the Crimson offense.
“Shilpa is still working at bringing consistency to her game,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think she’s an elite player who hasn’t been very consistent for us.”
Metoyer had one of her best games of the season against the Big Red, as she was one of Harvard’s top scorers with 15 points in the contest.
Though the game was close down to the end, the Crimson played with a cushion it has not been used to as of late, as seven games this season prior to Friday night have been determined by four points or less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So many championships, so little time.
One week after raking in multiple first-place finishes at the Ivy League Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships, junior Danielle Lee continued to make waves this weekend. Representing the Crimson in the ECAC Open Championships held at the University of Pittsburgh, Lee broke both the pool and conference records in the 100 backstroke.
After finishing second in the prelims with a time of 54.20, Lee notched it up for the event finals. She finished in 53.16, almost half a second in front of the second place finisher, Pittsburgh junior Blair Wegescheide.
“When I’m competing, the records don’t really matter to me,” Lee said. “It’s just the results of my hard training. [Breaking records] isn’t really one of my goals that I go for, so if it happens to come along, that’s really, really nice.”
Lee’s name will now be seen in the record books of both Trees Pool and the ECAC, replacing two fairly young records. The previous pool record was set by Notre Dame’s Kelly Ryan in 2012, who recorded a 53.32 finish.
For the ECAC record, Lee championed the previous 53.43 time that had been standing for barely a year—a record that had been set by former Ancient Eight swimmer, Princeton’s Lisa Boyce, whom Lee had overtaken at last year’s Ivy League Championships. At Ivies, Lee edged out Boyce—then a senior—in the same event, taking gold by 0.02 seconds.
“Competition-wise, [Lee is] awesome,” freshman Gabby Sims said. “She’s someone that we can always rely on. She’s really consistent, and she can come through and carry the team when the team needs her to.”
But setting records and topping the podium is nothing new to Lee. As a sophomore, she set records for both Harvard and Blodgett Pool, swimming the 100 back in 52.77 as part of the 400 medley at Ivies. This year, at the Texas Invite, she shattered another program record in the 200 back, finishing in 1:54.63—a full 0.34 ahead of the record set in 2012.
In addition, Lee ranks third in the Crimson record books for her time in the 100 butterfly, fifth in the 200 freestyle, and ninth in the 100 free.
But with all her individual glory, Lee attributes much of her success to the presence of her team.
“Training with my team has just made it so much more enjoyable,” Lee said. “They make me love the sport so much. [Success] just comes with having fun every day at the pool.”
Her performance in the 100 back earned her an NCAA ‘B’ cut time last year, making her the only Harvard swimmer to qualify and compete at the 2014 NCAA Championships.
This year, Lee decided to aim for NCAAs again at the ECAC Championships with hopes of improving on her season-best time of 52.96. But despite her efforts, Lee was unable to dip below this time, which she swam at the Texas Invite in December. Thus, she will have to wait and see if she qualifies for the national tournament.
“One of my goals [for this meet] was just trying to better my times and trying to maybe compete in NCAAs in March,” Lee said. “Another one was just to compete just for fun, not really having any pressure—just doing it to see how far I can go.”
Even so, Lee has found success this year, routinely placing first in individual events and leading relay teams to victory. Looking forward, she hopes that the team will be able to fill the void left by the departure of this year’s seniors and claim the Ivy League crown.
As for herself, Lee has other ambitions, including qualifying for NCAAs, having the chance to compete at next year’s Olympic trials, and simply improving every day.
But behind the fast times and record-breaking swims is a leader who has earned the respect of her teammates.
“She’s a great person to have, she has a great energy,” Sims said. “She’s really fun, she keeps things light, and then she’ll get in the water and swim really fast. I love swimming with her because it makes me want to go faster too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s sailing opened its spring season this weekend at the Charleston Women’s Interconference Regatta. Racing at the J. Stewart Walker Sailing Complex, the two Crimson boats competing in the regatta combined for 157 points. Harvard finished fourth of 14 teams, behind No. 3 Georgetown, No. 13 Vermont, and No. 1 Yale.
Harvard competed against squads from various conferences and regions, including its own NEISA, the SAISA and the MAISA. The unranked Crimson team also sailed against a number of ranked teams, beating No. 9 Charleston, No. 11 St. Mary’s, and No. 4 Navy.
In division A, the pair of junior Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis competed for the Crimson, finishing with 95 points. The pair consistently crossed the finish line near the front of the pack, but a few low-placing races left them at seventh overall.
In division B, freshman Taylor Ladd and sophomore Emma Wheeler increased Harvard’s status, tallying 62 points to take second. Of their 14 races, the pair finished four of them in second place, and all but two in the top half of the division.
Both days saw fairly good conditions with winds of 6-14 knots coming from the NNE. Held on the Cooper River near host College of Charleston, the air temperature hovered around 50 degrees. Saturday also saw a weakening flood tide, while on Sunday racers had to contend with a strong outgoing tide.
This regatta marked the first of the spring season, during which all races are completed team style, with two people per boat. At Charleston, the division A pair sailed in FJs while division B competed in 420s.
Coming out of a fall season during which the Crimson placed top-10 in 16 regattas, the team prepares itself for a packed and competitive spring schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo squad travelled to Lewisburg, Pa. for a three-game set that included two tilts against conference opponents in its own division. Competing at Bucknell, the Crimson (8-4, 4-1 CWPA) walked away with three consecutive wins, building some momentum heading into this Saturday’s Harvard Invite.
HARVARD 11, HARTWICK 6
Though it was their second time in the pool on the day, the Crimson women had little trouble dispatching the Hawks (8-12, 3-2) after building an early lead. Just as in the morning, Harvard jumped to a 3-1 lead after the first quarter, with junior attackers Rachel Lobato and Charlotte Hendrix and senior attacker Victoria Frager each finding the back of the net.
For the second time of the day, the Crimson was not seriously threatened, as Hartwick would not pull closer than two goals after the first period of play. With the victory, Harvard stretched its winning streak to four and also topped a Hawks squad that was ranked two spots higher than the Crimson at No. 4 in the latest CWPA conference poll.
HARVARD 12, BUCKNELL 5
Backed by 14 saves from senior goalie Ariel Dukes, the Crimson outscored the Bison (6-4, 1-4) in each of the four quarters en route to a 12-5 win on Sunday.
Up 3-1 after the first period of play, Hendrix scored three of the next four Harvard goals to extend the lead to 7-3 at the halfway mark. The Santa Barbara, Calif., native would finish with a game-high five goals, just two short of her career high.
Besides Hendrix, the Crimson women spread the wealth in the contest, with each of the first three goals coming from different members of the team and freshman attacker Michelle Martinelli making an impact with a pair of goals of her own.
HARVARD 12, MERCYHURST 2
Though they may have been the bottom-feeder of the CWPA conference poll for the third consecutive week, the Lakers (3-5, 1-3) kept the contest close for a time, as the Crimson could only muster two goals from junior attacker Yoshi Anderson and sophomore attacker Alexis Del Toro in the first quarter.
But the slim Harvard lead quickly widened to 5-0 in the second, with the Crimson defense containing Mercyhurst attackers thoroughly. Seven more goals from Harvard pushed the game score to its final, with Dukes and freshman goalie Cleo Harrington splitting time in the net in the strong collective performance. Sophomore attacker Melissa Balding had three goals and an assist to pace the Crimson offense.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend marked the end of team play for the Harvard men’s squash squad (10-4, 7-0 Ivy). However, a few players continued onwards to the Collegiate Squash Association Individual Championships this weekend at Princeton’s Jadwin Squash Courts. Sophomore Bryan Koh, junior Matt Roberts, and freshman David Ryan aimed to continue the legacy of Harvard alum, Ali Farag ’14, who won the Pool Trophy last year.
The Crimson  started strong at the competition with players advancing to both the quarterfinals of the Molloy Cup draw and the semifinals for the Pool Trophy. Those competing for the Molloy Cup are players ranked 33rd and below, and those competing for the Pool Trophy are among the top 32 collegiate players in the nation.
The first day of Championships went well for the Crimson. In the Molloy Cup division, No. 53 ranked Roberts won two 3–1 matches against Hobart College’s Terrance Rose and Penn’s James Watson. Even after being injured during this season, Roberts was able to move on to the quarterfinals. Continuing onwards, he went 1-1 on the second day of the Championship where he beat Cornell’s Graham Dietz 3-1 before losing 3-0 to Trinity’s Affeeq Ismail with a spot in the semifinals at stake.
Koh, a Pool Trophy competitor ranked 31st, ended Friday with a win and a loss. He was bested by Cornell’s Aditya Jagtap in three games but then recovered with a 3-0 victory against Yale’s Sam Fenwick. Koh went on to lose, 3 -1, in the quarterfinal of the consolation Pool Trophy tournament on the second day.
In the same division, No. 23 ranked Ryan performed above expectations against opponents ranked much higher than he was. He swept his opponents, Neil Cordell of Rochester and Marwan Mahmoud of Penn, in three games to advance to the quarterfinals. Both competitors were seeded more than ten spots above Ryan.
“The man of the weekend without question is David Ryan,” Harvard coach Michael Way said. “I think the biggest thing was mentally, he really showed a lot of maturity. He was against a set of players that on paper are more experienced. It was an astounding weekend for him.’”
Ryan also performed well in his quarterfinal match against Jagtap, who was ranked fourth in the entire tournament and had also knocked Koh out earlier in the tournament. After falling behind, 8-10, against his opponent in the first game, Ryan was able to fight back to clinch his first win of the match. He went on to sweep Jagtap in three games for a chance to compete in the semifinals.
“It’s the first time I’ve played this tournament,” Ryan said. “I was winning a match against a first-team all-American. [It was a] big moment for me and a huge step up to be playing one of the best players in college squash. I played some of the best squash of my life in that match.”
In what proved to be his final match, Ryan fell to No. 3 Osama Khalifa of Columbia despite keeping things close in all three games with final scores of 11-7, 11-8, and 11-8. Khalifa went on to lose in the finals of the championship, claiming second in the tournament. Over the span of this weekend, Ryan’s individual ranking rose from 23rd to fourth overall in the country.
The Crimson finished the season with a team ranking of third and individual rankings as high as fourth. As the coach of a young team which often featured four freshmen in the top nine, Way views these results as a success.
“[The guys are] starting to prove themselves as squash players,” Way said. “When you’ve got that excitement, no matter what, win or lose, you know you’re going to have an exciting season. The work ethic and attitude is quite remarkable this year. I feel no doubt that it’s going to be that and then some next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team kicked off its 2015 campaign with a trip to Spartanburg, S.C. for a four-game weekend series with Wofford. The Terriers (9-3) were coming off their first loss of the season, an 11-5 defeat to ACC powerhouse Clemson.
Fueled by victories in both games of Saturday’s doubleheader, the Crimson was able to earn a series split and pick up two victories in its opening weekend for the first time since 2010.
“I thought overall it was a pretty good first weekend for us,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “For us to come out this weekend and get two wins, that was huge for us. Our starting pitching was really great [Saturday], that was definitely the key.”
WOFFORD, 7, HARVARD, 0
Harvard fell behind early and could not get anything going offensively on Sunday, dropping the final game of the series for the weekend split. Freshman Adam Scott threw a complete game shutout for Wofford, conceding only three singles and two walks.
With Sunday starter and senior Tanner Anderson unavailable, junior Nick Scahill got the start for the Crimson. The junior lasted only two and two-thirds innings and was tagged for the loss after giving up three earned runs. Junior Sean O’Neill temporarily stopped the bleeding for Harvard, throwing two and a third scoreless innings, but the Terriers tacked on four more runs, and the Crimson offense was held hitless from the third inning until the eighth.
Designated hitter Matt Ramsay had three hits and catcher Carson Waln drove in three runs for Wofford.
HARVARD, 3, WOFFORD, 1
Led by senior Matt Timoney’s arm and McGuiggan’s bat, Harvard was able to pick up a sweep of Saturday’s doubleheader. Timoney struck out six and gave up only one hit in five innings of work, while the second baseman had two singles and drove in two runs to propel the Crimson.
“Once we strung a couple hits together there, we felt like we had a little momentum,” McGuiggan said. “I was able to get a couple pretty good pitches to hit and take advantage of those. Our confidence with our pitchers on the mound definitely helped us.”
Co-captain and catcher Ethan Ferreira got Harvard on the board in the top of the first with a groundout to second. The Crimson added runs in the second and seventh when McGuiggan drove in Jake Colton both time. The hosts’ only real offensive threat came in the seventh, when four Terriers reached base, but the hosts only produced one run.
Anderson was dominant in shutting the door on Wofford, striking out two and retiring all seven batters he faced. The senior only had to throw 16 pitches to pick up his second save.
HARVARD, 2, WOFFORD, 1
Harvard bounced back from its opening game loss with a come-from-behind victory in a contest that was defined with strong pitching on both sides. Left fielder Demetrius Jennings, the Terriers’ nine-hole hitter, scored on sophomore Nick Gruener’s wild pitch in the third to give Wofford the lead. The wild pitch was one of the only mistakes on the day for Gruener, who struck out seven and did not surrender an extra-base hit in six innings.
“I think my fastball and my slider were working really well, cutting in on guys,” Gruener said. “They really didn’t like inside pitches so two-seam fastballs worked well and I felt really comfortable on the mound.”
In the seventh, Crimson senior catcher Steve Dill scored on a balk by Terrier reliever Jacob Condra-Bogan and in the following inning, Harvard was able to tack on the decisive run when junior infielder Mitch Klug flied out to bring in freshman Connor Quinn.
Junior righty T.J. Laurisch gave up a double to Wofford’s Ramsay in the bottom half of the frame, but Anderson ended the threat and pitched a scoreless ninth to pick up the save.
WOFFORD, 9, HARVARD, 2
The Crimson began its season Friday afternoon in Spartanburg, giving the ball to junior righty Sean Poppen. A five-run third inning for the Terriers broke open a game that was briefly tied at one.
In Wofford’s big inning, a hit by pitch and two singles loaded the bases with nobody out. Two errors, a sacrifice fly, and a balk gave the Terriers a 6-1 lead they would never relinquish. Wofford starter Matthew Milburn scattered seven hits, giving up one run in his six innings of work.
Harvard’s first four hitters went a combined 9-for-19 with three doubles, led by senior center fielder Mike Martin’s three-hit day, but the rest of the lineup could only muster two hits.
“We’re definitely going to be playing some good teams,” McGuiggan said. “If we can maintain some of the pitching we had this weekend but improve the offense, I think we’ll be in good shape moving forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team continued its strong run of late, further building up for its main spring season as it earned a weekend sweep. On Saturday, the Crimson easily dispatched St. John’s and local rival Boston University at the Murr Center.
Harvard (11-3), which has won six of its last seven matches, is currently ranked 22nd in the country, marking the Crimson’s highest ranking since April of 2013.
“Whenever you get two wins in a day, it’s a good thing,” senior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “With doubleheaders, you have to stay focused throughout the day…. We’re really happy with the way the team competed.”
HARVARD 6, BU 1 
In Saturday’s second contest, the Crimson took down the Terriers (2-1, 1-0 Patriot), despite starting mostly backup players.
In doubles, Harvard easily won all three matches. Junior Conor Haughey and sophomore Andrew Ball won, 6-4, on the third court, while co-captain Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kenny Tao moved up to court two, but still cruised, 6-1. Sophomore Sebastian Beltrame and freshman Jean Thirouin prevailed by the same score in the top slot.
The Crimson carried the momentum over to singles, where it won the first three matches to clinch the match early. Junior Kelvin Lam, sophomore Andrew Ball, and Chaudhuri all took their respective contests in straight sets to clinch the win for Harvard.
Playing up at number one, sophomore Brian Yeung came back from a first-set loss to win in three, and freshman Xavier Gonzalez was credited with a win on court six.
Harvard freshman Grant Solomon took the Crimson’s only loss, going down in three sets in the third slot.
“Doubleheaders give a chance to those who don’t get to play in as many matches,” Chaudhuri said. “The team prides itself on its depth. Everyone has to be ready to play every day.”
HARVARD 4, ST. JOHN’S 0 
In Saturday’s early match, the Crimson rolled to a 4-0 victory over the No. 74 Red Storm (4-5, 1-0 Big East). Harvard has faced St. John’s every spring for each of the past four seasons, and has defeated the Red Storm each time.
The Crimson earned the doubles point by picking up wins on the second and third courts.  Haughey and Ball won, 7-5, in the third slot, while Beltrame and junior Nicky Hu took a 6-3 victory.
In singles, Harvard rolled out its top lineup, and showcased its strength from top to bottom. The Crimson men captured four first sets to set themselves in prime position.
The match finished quickly, as Yeung won, 6-4, 6-3, Hu prevailed, 6-4, 7-5, and co-captain Denis Nguyen, ranked 47th nationally, closed out the match, 6-2, 7-5.
While Harvard made quick work of its two opponents on Saturday, the team’s three defeats this season have come at the hands of three ranked teams: Berkeley, Vanderbilt, and Northwestern.
However, the team does not see its losses against top competition as a weakness, according to Crimson coach Dave Fish.
“It’s not really an issue, especially since the matches were so close [The Crimson lost to the Commodores and Wildcats by the same 4-3 margin]…. It hasn’t dampened our enthusiasm,” Fish said. “Some people played spectacularly in those matches. These matches are excruciatingly close—[the equivalent of] a three-point shot at the buzzer.”
And even with the close calls against top teams, Fish has seen progress and consistency from his squad.
“The team has done a really good job at being consistent, whether we’ve won or lost matches,” Fish said. “You have the feeling that everyone out there knew what he was doing and wasn’t going to get thrown off, and that builds a lot of confidence for the team.”
From here, Harvard has a two-week break to gear up for its annual spring break trip.
“Now, we’ll take two weeks to just work on our games,” Chaudhuri said. “During most of the season, we can’t take a two-week period to work on specific areas. But now we have time to increase our conditioning, work on technical components of our games, and get some rest mentally and physically.”
