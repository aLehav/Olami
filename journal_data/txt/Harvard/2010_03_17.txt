After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of its best start in three seasons, the Harvard baseball team has so far fulfilled predictions for strong performances on the mound. Unfortunately, this past weekend saw the squad drop two out of three games at the Metrodome Tournament in Minneapolis, Minn.
“Pitching, that’s been the highlight of our trip,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said, “Our three starting pitchers have all given us very good outings.”
With the help of its junior and sophomore starting hurlers, the Crimson (3-3) beat Creighton (8-4) on the last day of tournament play, after falling to Minnesota (5-9) and South Dakota State (8-4) on Friday and Saturday.
“It was a good experience for us to play in the dome on a major league field for the weekend,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “And it was good for us to get out of there with a win and get some momentum going into the week.”
HARVARD 5, CREIGHTON 2
In its last game of the weekend, Harvard was able to take down the Bluejays thanks to the Crimson’s deciding runs late in the game.
“It was a real team effort on Sunday,” Albright said. “And we saw some really great offensive production from our lineup.”
Sophomore Jeff Reynolds hit a single to center field, and senior Dan Zailskas hit a double to left, each for an RBI to put Harvard ahead in the sixth inning. Reynolds and fellow sophomore Marcus Way both contributed two more RBI off doubles in the eighth to build up the Crimson’s lead.
Reynolds also contributed to team defense at second base, along with junior Sean O’Hara at shortstop.
“We had O’Hara and Reynolds in the middle making terrific plays and saving some runs with diving catches [that] really helped us a lot,” Walsh said.
Against Harvard’s starting pitcher, junior Eric Eadington, Creighton was only able to get two runs and five hits in the first seven innings of play. The Crimson lefty also avoided walking any Bluejay batters during his time on the mound.
Zailskas came in as relief and allowed the opponent only one hit in two innings to secure Harvard’s three-run victory.
“We had some great pitching,” Walsh said. “And I think we played our best baseball game of the year against Creighton.”
SOUTH DAKOTA STATE 7, HARVARD 4
With seven innings already in the books in Saturday’s game, it looked like the Crimson was headed towards its third win of the season, but the Jackrabbits had something else in mind.
South Dakota State junior Jesse Sawyer batted in the Jackrabbits’ tying run in the top of the eighth, as well as the base-clearing three-run triple to end the game after ten grueling innings of play.
“[Sophomore pitcher] Connor Hulse did a great job leading late into the ball game, but our bullpen kind of fell apart, getting behind hitters and walking guys,” Walsh said. “[Sophomore Jonah] Klees and [freshman Robert] Wineski were just getting banged up a little bit.”
In the end, South Dakota State’s powerful offense proved too much for Harvard to handle.
MINNESOTA 7, HARVARD 1
On the first day of the tournament, the Golden Gophers defeated the Crimson in a gritty defensive game.
Sophomore Brent Suter started on the mound and kept Minnesota’s lead to within two runs, but a late streak of Golden Gopher batters broke open the game and created a deficit Harvard couldn’t match.
Minnesota’s junior pitcher Seth Rosin, who struck out 12 Harvard batters, kept the Crimson’s offense quiet for the day.
“We had a really tough time catching up to his fastball,” Walsh said. “It was just great pitching that stopped us.”
Harvard recorded five hits, but with only one run, it wasn’t enough to avoid the loss.
The Metrodome Tournament marked the beginning of the Crimson’s busy schedule, and the remaining matches of this ten-game road trip could bring some unexpected challenges.
Harvard is dealing with injury-related setbacks to key players including junior pitcher Max Perlman and Albright behind the plate, but a string of freshman pitchers looks to bring fresh talent to the field.
“They’re going to see a lot of innings,” Albright said. “And the most important thing is to get them used to being on the mound in some high stress situations where we’ll be relying on them to get outs.”
But no matter the outcome, the team is looking to enjoy the rest of the trip.
“All I say, is that they’re getting to play baseball everyday on spring break,” Walsh said. “With this great group of kids, it’s something special. Team morale’s going to be high, win or lose.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s diving teams sent four representatives to the NCAA Zone A Championships this past weekend. The tournament, held at Rutgers University in New Jersey, featured 89 top divers from 24 schools, and the Crimson didn’t back down from rigorous competition.
Freshman Michael Stanton went on to the three-meter finals after finishing in 12th place during the qualifying round. He then placed in the 11th spot overall to conclude with 582.95 points. Stanton achieved the same standing in the one-meter dive, and in that event he summed up 572.65 points.
Junior Jenny Reese, sophomore Leslie Rea, and freshman Brittany Powell represented the women’s diving team at the three-day tournament. Reese and Rea reached the one-meter finals and posted top-20 finishes. Rea came in 16th place while Reese finished 11th overall. Powell took 33rd place in the qualifying round.
The three divers couldn’t get past the stiff competition in the three-meter event, though, with Rea coming in 20th in the preliminary rounds. Powell stood at three places below Rea and Reese finished in 31st place.
Up next for the Harvard men’s team are the NCAA Championships in Columbus Ohio, starting on March 25th through the 27th. The Crimson women’s team only has a few days to rest up before the NCAA Championships at Purdue, from March 18-20.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an impressive performance at the NCAA Northeast Fencing Regionals, Harvard fencers put the team in a good position for next week’s NCAA fencing championships.
In the competition held last Sunday in Providence, R.I., Crimson sophomore swordsman James Hawrot was the team’s best finisher, earning first place in the epee.  He went 8-3 in the final round against the toughest opposition in the Northeast for the win after posting a 4-2 and 5-1 record in the first and second rounds, respectively.
“Obviously our best result,” said Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand.  “He was very strong.”
In the same division, co-captain Karl Harmenberg finished third, as he also boasted an 8-3 record in the final round after going 4-2 in the first round and 3-3 in the second.
“This is a great way for him to finish his career here,” Brand said.
Freshman Ben White also made it to the final round in the epee, coming in at 9th place with a 5-6 record.  He was 6-0 in the first round and 5-1 in the second.
In the foil, freshman Tommasso di Robilant finished second, just ahead of his teammate, junior Hao Meng, who finished third.
“[Meng] really came out this year and did what we always though we could do, and that is to qualify for the national championship,” Brand said.
Di Robilant was 8-3 in the final round after going undefeated in the second round and 3-3 in the first.  Meng went 7-4 in the final pool, following a 3-3 record in the first and 4-2 in the second.
Co-captain Long Ouyang was 4-2 in the first round before failing to post a win in the second, eliminating him from the competition.
The sabre division saw two Crimson fencers finish in the top ten, as freshman Michael Tom and sophomore Valentin Staller finish seventh and ninth, respectively.  Freshman Thomas Kolasa also competed, but was eliminated before the final round.
On the women’s side, sophomore co-captains Noam Mills and Caroline Vloka each finished second in the epee and sabre divisions, respectively.
“Both Noam and Caroline are world-class fencers,” Brand said.  “It’s not surprising that they did as well as they have.”
Mills was 8-3 in the final round after going undefeated in the first and second round, finishing 20-3 overall in the competition.
“It was good practice,” Mills said.  “I fenced pretty well against all the people I’m going to fence against at NCAA’s.”
Freshman Felicia Sun finished sixth in the same division.  She was 6-5 in the final round, 4-2 in the second, and 5-1 in the first.  Sun, a walk-on, was one of 12 Harvard fencers to qualify for the NCAA championships.
“You rarely see a walk-on fencer qualify for the national championships,” Brand said.  “Its kudos to her that she was able to do that.”
Classmate Nadia Eldeib was eliminated after a 1-5 record in the first round of the epee.
Vloka, competing in the sabre, was 9-2 in the final round following an undefeated first round and a 4-2 second round.  Sophomore Hayley Levitt and freshman Elene Helgiu were each eliminated before the final round of the competition, and finished 13th and 14th, respectively.
Sophomore Shelby MacLeod was the highest Crimson finisher in the foil division, as she fenced her way to fourth place.  She was 7-4 in the final round after going 4-2 in the second round and 5-1 in the first.
Senior Arielle Pensler posted a 4-2 record in the first and second round, but a 4-7 record in the finals dropped her to 8th place.  Classmate Misha Goldfeder finished 10th, as she went 3-8 in the final round after going 5-1 in the first and second rounds.  Freshman Katherine Chou was 3-3 in the first round and 2-4 in the second, before a 1-10 mark in the final round relegated her to 12th place.
“I’m happy overall with my performance and the performance of all my teammates,” Mills said.  “Even the ones that didn’t qualify all supported the other members of the team.”
An announcement by the NCAA Tuesday revealed that Mills, along with Sun, Goldfeder, MacLeod, Helgiu and Vloka, was selected to fence at the Finals on the women’s side. Hawrot, Harmenberg, di Robilant, Meng, Staller, and Tom will represent Harvard on the men’s side.
Brand was very complimentary of his entire team, and thinks that the Crimson is one of five teams with a good shot at the national title, as 12 Harvard fencers qualified to compete at the NCAA Finals, to be held at the Gordon Track Center March 25-28.
“We had a very good result overall,” the coach said.  “If you [can qualify twelve fencers], they you can really challenge and have a shot at winning the championship.”
Brand noted that the last time 12 Crimson fencers qualified for the NCAA Finals was 2006, when Harvard brought home the national title.
“It bodes well for us,” Brand said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 1946, the Harvard men’s basketball team will play a postseason game.
The Crimson will end the 64-year drought tonight when it travels to Boone, N.C. to take on Appalachian State in the first round of the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament.
“We think it’s a monumental step,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “These are fun moments and opportunities that have not come very often for our school and our program, so we’re proud, and we’re excited about representing Harvard in a tremendous fashion on the road down in North Carolina.”
The Crimson (21-7, 10-4 Ivy) will have its work cut out for itself in its opening-round matchup against the Mountaineers (22-12, 13-5 Southern).
Led by guards Donald Sims and Kellen Brand, Appalachian State possesses a potent offense that is capable of lighting up the scoreboard for 80-plus points, something the Mountaineers have done eight times already this season.
“Appalachian State is an up-tempo, fast-breaking, high-scoring team that has tremendous scorers from the perimeter,” Amaker said. “It’s a good match for us, to be very honest.”
Sims, a 6’1” junior, leads the offense and averages 20 points per game. Sims, who possesses a deadly stroke from deep, does much of his damage from the outside, as he shot 42 percent from beyond the arc during the regular season.
Brand is no lousy shooter himself, knocking down 37 percent of his tries from deep.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin and freshman Brandyn Curry, Harvard’s top perimeter defenders, should have their hands full trying to shut down the Mountaineer guards.
Lin will look to make up for a lousy performance in his final conference matchup of the season against Princeton, where the senior finished 1-of-8 from the field in a losing effort.
Appalachian State is currently riding a hot streak, winning 10 of its last 12 games to finish off the regular season. With impressive victories over Robert Morris, Winthrop, and Wofford, the Mountaineers possess an RPI of 101, just a single spot behind Harvard.
While it may have been 64 years since a Crimson squad earned a berth in the postseason, this year’s team still has the opportunity to do something no Harvard team has ever done before—come away with a postseason victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team (9-21-3) battled through difficult first and second periods before finally falling, 3-0, to No. 9 Cornell (19-8-4) at Lynah Rink in the second game of its ECAC quarterfinal series on Saturday night.
The loss effectively ended the Crimson’s ECAC run, as well as its season. And for the first time in the 100-year history of the Harvard-Cornell hockey rivalry, the Crimson dropped four games to the Big Red during a single season.
“We went into the game knowing what they were going to bring,” captain Alex Biega said. “They’re a very gifted team, strong size-wise, and they’re difficult to play. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find the offensive flair we’ve had in years past and in recent games. It was obviously a great disappointment to the team to end the way it did, but that’s really the way the game goes sometimes.”
After a back-and-forth opening period, the Big Red got on the board at 12:05 of the second when senior Blake Gallagher scored a power play goal to put Cornell up, 1-0.
Though Harvard came close to tallying the equalizer several times, Gallagher’s lone second-period goal would stand as the game-winner.
“We really tried to prevent them from generating any offense…but slowly over time, the more chances we give them on the power play, it’s obviously one of those things where you have to limit them from power-play opportunities,” Biega said.
The Crimson headed into Saturday night’s matchup coming off of a 5-1 defeat the night before and—from the looks of the first period—seemed to be unable to neither shake off loss nor the frenzied atmosphere at Lynah generated by Cornell’s 4,267 fans.
Harvard only managed to put three shots on goal in that frame and was quickly denied each time by Big Red netminder Ben Scrivens, who recorded his fifth shutout of the season and 17th of his career.
“[Scrivens] is a candidate for the Hobey Baker, and he’s unbelievable,” Biega said. “Part of his success is that his team plays such a defensive game, and they don’t give up much at all. Against a defense like that, we need to have one of our best nights.”
The Crimson received its only power play opportunity of the night when Big Red junior forward Patrick Kennedy was whistled early in the second for hooking. But despite shots on goal from junior forward Pier-Olivier Michaud and freshman forward Marshall Everson, Scrivens kept the score tied at 0-0 before Gallagher put Cornell up just a few minutes later.
But Harvard was lucky to escape the second period just one goal down—it was outshot by the Big Red, 17-7, in the frame—thanks to strong play from junior goaltender Kyle Richter, who stopped 29 shots on the night.
“[Richter] really came out of his shell and carried the team on his back,” Biega said. “Unfortunately the result wasn’t there, but he made some very key saves that prevented them from scoring several times.”
Cornell added an insurance goal late in the third. With just over five minutes left in regulation, captain Colin Greening swooped behind and around the net before passing the puck to sophomore Sean Collins, who fired it into the top of the cage. Though the goal was reviewed, officials upheld the call on the ice to give the Big Red a 2-0 lead.
With the minutes on the clock ticking away, the Crimson kicked it into high gear. But Michaud was called for tripping at 17:30 to give Cornell the man advantage for majority of the balance of the game. Facing elimination as well as the end of the season, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 decided to pull Richter with just over a minute remaining in regulation.
But in the end, it was the Big Red that tallied the third and final goal of the night when Greening notched an empty-netter.
The win sends Cornell into the ECAC semifinals in Albany, N.Y., where it will meet Brown, and Harvard back home to Cambridge, where it will have to face the reality of how its season has played out.
“We’re all pretty disappointed in the season we had,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “We had a losing record and didn’t achieve some of the goals we set out in the beginning of the year. We played well against Princeton and played hard against Cornell, and in the end that’s really all you can control.”

If you’ve made your way out to Currier House recently, you might have seen ladders and cables scattered  throughout the House. Unfortunately, this construction project does not portend an  exciting new treehouse party space for Quadlings. Instead, the hard-hat wearing  (and sometimes noisy) workers are installing something a bit more mundane—a fire-fighting sprinkler system.
According to Zak M. Gingo '98, director of facilities management and operations, the University has been working  since last year on a two-year infrastructural modification—the installation of  the sprinkler system in all the University's residential buildings. Currier  is the last undergraduate residential building to have the sprinklers  installed, and most of that work will take place this summer.
But during spring break, some of Currier House’s closets—which will eventually be used to run vertical water-carrying pipes—will undergo an asbestos-abatement process  first, in order to get rid of the thin fibrous crystals found in the closet floor  tiles, that if airborne and inhaled, can cause serious lung cancers.
Gingo, however, said that the asbestos in Currier is not dangerous when it is sitting still in tile. The  abatement process is meant to prevent any possible disruption of the tiles that  may take place when the pipes are installed and cause the asbestos to become  airborne.
This should explain the loud noises coming from the closets, which have been sealed off in order to safely remove  the tiles under negative air pressure conditions.
Gingo said that these procedures are commonly used in residential settings.
"I am very confident that the conditions are safe for the workers and the students," Gingo said.
According to Gingo, the asbestos-abatement process should be finished by the end of this week.
Though it may not be a health concern, that's just enough time for students who are spending their spring break  in Currier to be driven crazy by all the noise associated with the  abatement process.

Wicked Local reported Tuesday that a fire in "a Harvard University dorm on Sunday left the building with close to $100,000 in smoke damage."
While a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said that the University has  determined how much the damage would cost, he noted that the flames only damaged an electrical panel. The fire took place at 10 Akron St., at a property that contains 151 apartments that are rented out to Harvard affiliates.
"On Mar. 14, an electrical panel in the basement that controls the air conditioning system at 10 Akron Street malfunctioned and melted, emitting fumes that set off the smoke alarms.  The problem was quickly resolved and the building cleared for re-occupancy.  The only damage was to the electrical panel.  No injuries were reported.  The building is used as affiliate housing and is operated by Harvard Real Estate Services," Neal wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
He also said that the fire was put out with a fire extinguisher.
