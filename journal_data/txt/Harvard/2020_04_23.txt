After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With terms like “quarantine,” “self-isolation,” and “social distancing” becoming commonplace in our daily conversations, the spring of 2020 has prompted an unprecedented change in social dynamics. Following the great coronavirus-induced student diaspora, “grabbing a meal” has been replaced with scheduling FaceTime or Zoom calls. Blast these songs as you stay inside to linger in your newfound loneliness or reflect back on the good old days, when the furthest distance you had to traverse to see your friends was from the River the Quad.
“Waving Through a Window” from “Dear Evan Hansen”
This emotional ballad captures the sense of looking in at a world you cannot seem to access. The idea of tapping on the glass and watching people pass has never felt so literal as when you are actually stuck indoors with a stay-at-home order, waving at your friends through your webcam.
“Boulevard of Broken Dreams” by Green Day
There is nothing like an angsty early 2000s ballad that declares “My shadow's the only one that walks beside me” to sum up this anthropological moment.
“On My Own” from “Les Miserables”
If your crush is now three time zones away, channel your inner French peasant to lament their absence with the ultimate Broadway classic for lonely hearts.
“Dancing on My Own” by Calum Scott
Clear out a corner of your bedroom and have your own little dance party. We all deserve it.
“For the First Time in Forever” from “Frozen”
In a bit of a tonal shift, this hopeful song is about the possibility of social interaction after years of loneliness and the dizzying excitement of isolation coming to an end.
“22” by Taylor Swift
Finally, to end on a brighter note, this bubbly pop song captures what senior spring was supposed to be. This is for all the nostalgia of life pre-social distancing, and what you have to look forward to once it is over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve always thought of Dua Lipa’s music as similar to a steroid: a substance that provides you with an exaggerated and enhanced version of yourself. There’s something almost maniacal about how emboldened and impassioned her songs make you feel. On “Hotter than Hell,” the 2016 single which helped launch Lupa’s career, Lipa frames herself as both the Devil and his juice, taunting a lover who can’t get enough of her. The song is high on its own power, thumping bass and Lipa’s thick, liquid-smooth voice crooning, “You probably still adore me / With my hands around your neck.” I was a sophomore in high school when I first heard the song — I was short, rotund, overzealous, and helplessly moving through a series of unrequited crushes. But listening to the song made me certain there would come a day I would be desired so deeply by so many that I would become haughty about it, wielding my power like Machiavelli. The song made me feel good, even if in a sinister way.
In February, when Lipa released “Physical,” the second single off her new album “Future Nostalgia,” I had a similarly intense experience. The song feels like a dancercise class and a fight club had a baby. Like all of Lipa’s songs, it is a hit of feeling, a kind of drug. As my friend Spencer once said of Lipa’s music: “Shit, I just left my body.” When I would listen to “Physical,” my walk to class would break out into a strut.
That’s something I miss: The 20 minute walk from my bedroom in the co-op to class in the yard, which I would take several times a day when we were still on campus and when the world was still a thing. That walk was my chance to envision a future, listening to music that would serve as that future’s soundtrack. I’d listen to Caroline Polacheck’s “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings” and imagine going on a coffee date with the hot grad student in my History of Art and Architecture seminar. I’d listen to Grimes’ “4ÆM” and have revenge fantasies.
The pandemic has totally ended this practice, not only because I no longer have anywhere to commute but because, when I try to envision a future, it looks less like a blank page, which would at least imply possibility, and more like an erased one. The plans and prospects have all been rubbed away. What’s left is some gray mess. I’ve applied for a summer internship at a magazine in New York, but I still don’t know if I’ve gotten it and, even if I do, I’m not sure if I’ll be working in an office or from my laptop. During the first two weeks of quarantine, whenever I was able to conjure up an image of the future, it seemed ill-suited for a musical soundtrack, better fit for white noise.
Then Dua Lipa dropped “Future Nostalgia,” and the album shot an arrow of such ecstasy through me that I couldn’t do anything but put my headphones in and run out of my front door into the middle of the street like an idiot. The goal of “Future Nostalgia” is in its name: Lipa wants to blast ahead in the world of pop music by looking at that world’s past. The album combines ’70s and ’80s pop and ’90s club culture, layered together in songs that overpower the senses. Like the pop music of the past, Lipa deals in extremes: the thrill of new love and the different thrill of kicking someone to the curb. On “Pretty Please,” Lipa gives us something of a manifesto for the album: “Somewhere in the middle / Think I lied a little.” The album is about anything but moderation, about feelings so strong you lose all inhibition.
“Love Again,” the eighth song on the album, samples the 1997 song “Your Woman” by White Town, but also sounds like Madonna’s 2005 song “Hung Up,” with its melodramatic build-up and the glorious, glittery payoff that comes afterward. The song is about the physical effects of new passion, reminding me of that Sappho poem in which she writes: “Fire is racing under skin / And in eyes no sight and drumming fill ears.” Dua Lipa describes these physical sensations too — the thumping in her chest and the sinking of her teeth — but mostly, throughout the song’s refrain, she expresses the sentiment in simpler terms: “Goddamn, you got me in love again.”
When I walked around my neighborhood listening to the song, the lines of the page started filling in again. I saw, against all reason, a future: Me wearing red overalls as I take the MTA to work, living in a Brooklyn apartment and cooking myself Annie’s mac n’ cheese, meeting a scruffy guy in his mid-twenties who wears a lot of linen, resting my head on his chest in Central Park, falling in love.
If this future sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. It’s fairytale, fabrication, farce. But, constructed, fantastical projections have always been what Lipa’s music is about. There’s a notion that the lyrics of female artists are deeply personal, even diaristic. When Lipa released “Don’t Start Now,” people speculated that it was about her ex-boyfriends. The stories Lipa tells though aren’t ones from her life, they’re ones she invents. “Hotter than Hell” made me feel good and powerful and, it turns out, Lipa wrote the song so she could feel that way too. The song made her feel like she was “everything that somebody made me feel I wasn’t,” she said. “I was like: ‘O.K., I’m going to flip the script. I’m going to make it seem as if he couldn’t get enough of me… I went into this imaginative world where everything had changed.”
If Lipa’s music has little to do with her own real-life scenarios, it has even less to do with real-world applications for her listeners. Did any of us actually follow her “New Rules?” Personally, the only time I’ve experienced the empowerment and passion Lipa sings about are when I’m listening to her sing about them. The extreme, euphoric feelings are both created by and limited to the music. Lipa’s musical project isn’t about fabrication coming true. It’s about the thrill that fabrication can provide. On “Physical,” Lipa sings “I love the simulation we’re dreaming in.”
I’m learning this, now more than ever, during quarantine. I used to trick myself into believing that the future I saw while walking to class was possible. It’s not. Coronavirus has exposed what fiction any image of my future is — not only are the personal circumstances idealizations, but the national and global circumstances that are serving as backdrop for these images are, at best, tenuous right now. The set and the props have been revealed to be just that. But, in the untenability and insecurity of these images, is a newfound security: the realization that picturing a future is good for the sake of picturing a future.
When I listen to Dua Lipa’s songs and conjure up some fantastical image of this summer, my chest thuds. I can’t help but sink my teeth. I don’t know where I’m going to be this summer, I don’t know what job I’ll have, or if I’ll even have one at all. I don’t know if I’ll fall in love this summer or who I’ll fall in love with and I have no idea what our world is going to be like, but, goddamn, I am in love with Dua Lipa right now.

Phoebe Bridgers has been busy. The indie rock darling released her debut album “Stranger in the Alps” in 2017, quickly followed by an EP and an album with supergroups boygenius and Better Oblivion Community Center in 2018 and 2019. Ahead of her highly anticipated sophomore album “Punisher,” out June 19, Bridgers dropped “Kyoto,” a single whose delicate lyrics and sprawling sound feel something like flying.
“Kyoto” is a departure from style for Bridgers, who tends towards producing solemn, symphonic ballads — tracks that, even when upbeat, are most easily characterized by the ache inherent in her voice. “Kyoto,” however, is more ambivalent than it is aching, grounded by a bouncing drumline and the firm hum of electric guitar. “I wrote this one as a ballad first,” Bridgers said in a press release. “But at that point I was so sick of recording slow songs, it turned into this.” The song opens with a fast and frantic verse, keeping pace with the quick beat before swelling into a loud and loose chorus with horns courtesy of Bright Eyes’ Nathaniel Walcott. If you were to divide Bridgers’ discography into songs to cry to or drive to, “Kyoto” falls solidly in the second category, with the kind of headbanging chorus perfectly attuned to driving 70 mph down a freeway.
While the construction of a banger may feel like a leap for Bridgers, she sticks the landing with the lyrics. She sets the scene in Tokyo, where the ghosts of home have followed her overseas via a payphone. “You called me from a payphone,” she sings in the first verse, “To tell me you’re getting sober / And you wrote me a letter / But I don’t have to read it.” Bridgers delivers the lines in tight groups of three, letting her verses float over the beat. She sneaks some of her signature ache into the yearning vocals of the chorus. The light threat of murder in the lines “I’m gonna kill you / If you don’t beat me to it” is delicously sardonic, thanks to Bridger’s stretched-out vocals and the playful “woo” she utters at the chorus’s end. She then takes a break from Tokyo, zeroing in on the suburban imagery of parking at a Goodwill to “stare at the chem trails.” You know the sky is clear and blue without her having to say it.
The gem of “Kyoto” is its outro. As the final chorus shifts from dreamy optimism to disillusionment — “I wanted to see the world / Through your eyes until it happened / Then I changed my mind” — the drums and horn swell for one final burst. Bridgers sings “Guess I lied / I’m a liar / Who lies / ‘Cause I’m a liar,” each line dragged out with more than a hint of cynicism. Simple on the surface, the words are clear nods to anyone for whom a strained familial or romantic relationship is synonymous with the defensive accusation of lying, of blowing things out of proportion.
Bridgers may call herself a liar, but when she lets her voice soar on “Kyoto” it’s hard not to believe her.

If ever there was a musician for the manic pixie dream girls and boys of the 21st century, Sufjan Stevens would be it — or at least he would’ve been, before his latest album, “Aporia.”
Stevens is a staple of the alternative music scene, though his particular brand verges less on the indie-pop funk of Cage The Elephant and Vampire Weekend and more on the folksy, acoustic vibes of Fleet Foxes and The Paper Kites. He earned his place in the indie folk hall of fame in the early aughts, when he helped to pioneer a genre movement largely characterized by monotone vocals, near-indistinguishable chord changes, and slow, languid strums of an unplugged guitar.
He has remained relevant over the years because his sound is so distinctive. There are certain staples to a Sufjan Stevens song, or at least there were: raspy vocals, the occasional odd, disjointed-yet-brilliant saxophone or oboe solo; a banjo so tickled that one can physically see fingers flicking between the strings.
His is music meant for long road trips through dusty stretches of California in vintage convertibles, sun-soaked porches in the American South, and fair-trade coffee shops in Brooklyn. Stevens occupies, and is a metaphor for, a singularly unique niche in American alternative culture. Slow down, says his music. Stay a while; daydream.
This is not the message his latest album, “Aporia,” released on March 24, conveys.
Perhaps because Stevens is, like many of his fellow indie artists, prone to experimentation, his albums are largely hit-and-miss. Some of his strokes of brilliance include “Seven Swans” (2004), “Illinois” (2005), and “Carrie & Lowell” (2015). In 2017, he released several songs featured in the smash-hit indie film “Call Me By Your Name,” including “Mystery of Love,” which portrays the stomach-swooping sensation of a first love with immaculate clarity.
This said, Stevens had released 16 unique albums since 2002 before “Aporia,” and many have — at least comparatively — flopped, at least in terms of listeners. Take, for example, the long-forgotten Christmas album, entitled “Songs for Christmas,” which features a whopping 42 songs on its discography.
“Aporia” is a collaborative effort with the artist Lowell Brams, who is also Stevens’s stepfather, which may contribute to its divergence from Stevens’s traditional path. Brams is an artist who works largely in the field of instrumental synth, and his only previous release was an album entitled “Library Catalogue Music Series: Music for Insomnia” in 2009.
True to form, “Aporia” is an instrumental album, and the best way to describe it is as simply strange. There is no acoustic strumming to be found on “Aporia.” Nor are there mildly-graphic lyrics about destructive love and trauma (disguised, of course, by a friendly, quiet guitar). “Aporia” is more new-age noise than it is indie, a collection of artificial sounds that teeter precariously toward ominous, and therefore toward unenjoyable.
Listening to “Aporia,” one cannot help but notice the ghosts in the room — other indie bands that stumbled down the path of noise, taunted by experimentation and the bizarre. Take Lou Reed, for instance, who released a solo album called “Metal Machine Music” in 1979, which is exactly what it sounds like: four 15-minute songs of screeching metal.
For what it is, “Aporia” is not bad, exactly. Here, perhaps, is where Stevens and Brams and Reed diverge into two separate camps: “Metal Machine Music” was bad noise. “Aporia” is comparatively good noise, if ever there existed such a thing. As an album, however, it is not particularly fun to listen to, which is arguably at the heart of music’s function in society. Listening to “Aporia,” one has the feeling that its songs belong on the score of “Stranger Things” or “Chernobyl,” not the independent album of an indie music icon.
There are some standaway songs that are genuinely enjoyable in their own ways — “Eudaimonia,” the penultimate track, is one; “Ataraxia” is another. There are, however, also tracks that are truly jarring, like “For Raymond Scott,” presumably named for the inventor of electric instruments, which is 34 seconds of unadulterated dissonance.
As an art form and part of the noise genre, “Aporia” mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. What it lacks, though — and what few noise albums actually accomplish — is a tangible connection with the audience. There is no stirring of emotion; no compulsion to keep listening, and listening, and listening. It lacks a fundamental resonance in a disembodied, soulless way.
“Aporia” thus follows in the footsteps of many of Stevens’s albums, which are never of poor quality, per se. The album simply lacks depth. Rather than eliciting a negative response, it is much more likely not to receive any at all.

Imagine a world where you could know whether or not you were exposed to COVID-19 — where you’d know, among the thousands of people you cross paths within a city, whether any had symptoms in the last month.
This world may be closer than we think. The technology solutions that make it possible already exist and are being deployed. China has launched apps that track people’s exposure to the virus by requiring them to share their location, address, and unique identifier with government authorities. South Korea tracks citizens that have been quarantined with a smartphone safety protection app to make sure they do not break their quarantine. A similar solution has been used by Taiwan, where a mobile-based electronic system monitors phone signals and sends alerts to the police if those in quarantine leave their home or switch off their phones.
But there’s an obvious problem here: the privacy violation. Coronavirus can be used as an excuse for countries and companies to breach personal freedoms and impose mass surveillance.
Even in Europe, the standard-setter of privacy protections with its General Data Protection Regulation, a provision in the law that allows suspension “for reasons of public interest in the field of public health” has been invoked due to COVID-19. The European Data Protection supervisor stressed that “the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind,” and that “the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right,” but “should be considered in relation to its function in society.” But the European Union considers the use of geo-location GPS tracking as too privacy-invasive and calls for a creation of a network of interoperable apps based on the proximity tracking via Bluetooth signals sent even when the phone is in the background mode.
The E.U. approach is in line with the recent initiative of the two biggest tech companies, Apple and Google, which announced a joint partnership to release an application programming interface tool enabling the creation of applications that collect contact tracing data via Bluetooth and share it across iOS and Android devices. The main challenge of proximity tracking via Bluetooth, however, is that mobile applications based on such a technology would require adoption by at least 60 percent of the population to be effective. Reaching that percentage is highly unlikely, as not everybody has a smartphone.
The good news is that many groups are working on ways to better solve the tradeoff between privacy and safety. For example, the MIT Media Lab team is designing a multi-modal solution combining GPS and Bluetooth technology for better inclusivity and accuracy. Supported by over 1000 volunteers (including me), it has just created a “privacy-by-design” contact-tracing tool: COVID Safe Paths. Safe Paths is a collaborative open source app where people who have tested positive voluntarily share their location data so that users can trace their interaction with COVID-19 carriers and health officials can better manage the pandemic’s outbreak. User privacy is protected because the data is anonymized and personally non-identifiable. The app also stores data on the user’s own device for a limited period of time and requires user consent for data sharing, thus eliminating the risk of government surveillance.
These projects around the world demonstrate the need for a new post-pandemic privacy regime. This regime will require the collaboration of governments and health providers in sharing health data — but foremost, it will require civic collaboration. To make people voluntarily give up their data, however, these apps will have to be trusted, data should be accurate, and people should see actionable results. More specifically, collected data should be useful, unbiased, acquired with consent in a secure and transparent manner, and processed only when necessary for the purpose for which they are supposed to be processed.
Groups like Harvard’s Expert Working Group on Government-Tech Partnership to Track COVID-19 are already having conversations about how such a privacy regime should look. After all, data is not going to end the epidemics — the system set in place after COVID-19 contact is traced will. If we can build trust, we will be in a position to achieve a new notion of privacy — one based around voluntary collectives, rather than loss of agency.
Or maybe it’s not so new. After all, in 1624, the poet John Donne, himself recovering from a bout of typhus in quarantine, famously wrote: “No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main … any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s true, as Yogi Berra once remarked, that “it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” While we may not have a crystal ball, now is a pretty good time to consider the possibility that college may not resume in the fall. On Tuesday night, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield said on record that “there’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.” Mind you, the one that we just went through still has an increasing death toll that, as of Wednesday night, sits at over 45,000 Americans.
Will a fall outbreak actually happen? I won’t speculate — nor am I remotely qualified to — but the possibility evidently is there. According to epidemiologists, it appears that only a few scenarios could allow us to return sustainably to normal life:
First: a vaccine (or treatment) could be invented. But this may take quite a while. The inventor of the rotavirus vaccine was particularly blunt recently, telling CNN that “when Dr. [Anthony S.] Fauci said 12 to 18 months, I thought that was ridiculously optimistic; and I’m sure he did, too.”
Second: so much of the population could contract this virus that it disappears on its own. However, the WHO stated this week that “not more than 2%-3%” of the world has been infected, and so the possibility of population herd immunity isn’t likely anytime soon.
Third: everybody with the virus could be successfully isolated — even asymptomatic cases. According to public health experts writing in The Lancet, a premier medical journal, this would be very difficult due to the virus’ transmissibility through asymptomatic patients.
Lastly, perhaps the virus will die out on its own. But until we get that stroke of luck, the outlook for resuming normal life doesn’t appear to be particularly great. With the vast unknowns, the University — like most major organizations — obviously has to deal with tradeoffs, and to optimize given these constraints.
An interesting follow-on question is what we might do if we were running the University. If there’s a one percent chance that an outbreak will happen in the fall, would we want to open? I would argue no.
The cost of an outbreak would be enormous: students, faculty, dining hall workers, and campus employees could contract the virus. And some could become very sick.
How would we quantify the cost to the University of, say, three professors and two students becoming severely (perhaps fatally) ill? Professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s microeconomics textbook estimates the value of a single life at around $10 million. But if my job were to run a University, I wouldn’t deliver up Professor Mankiw to the virus, even if we got $10 million in return. The cost of potentially losing a human life within your community (when it is needless to take such a risk) is, in my mind, extremely high.
The potential benefit of returning to in-person classes is more elusive than the cost. True, students would have a more enjoyable experience; the last thing I’d want is to miss my senior year on campus. But rolling the dice would constitute negligence from an institutional perspective. As long as an outbreak is possible — at any point during fall semester, the probabilistic cost simply outweighs the benefit.
But then we arrive at the problem of when the university does actually open up. If an outbreak is possible in the fall, nothing material may change by the spring. Perhaps school will need to be postponed until August 2021. But what material aspects of the situation will have changed by then?
Simply put, if the University believes that an outbreak is possible at all in the fall, its best decision is to start school online. Harvard can’t wait this out, because no one in the world knows when it’ll end. The optimal decision is to start and continue on Zoom, until it’s safe for a 70-year-old faculty member to lecture in Sever 113 again.
We inevitably reach the question of whether students would want an education based entirely online. Anecdotally, I’ve heard many people from all years say that they’d be willing to take a gap year. But if everybody takes a gap year, there’s quite a dilemma waiting for the administration once in-person school does resume.
For one, a sudden inflow of extra students would make on-campus housing nearly impossible. Indeed, when the class of 2021 had an admissions yield that was a couple percentage points higher than normal, the College ran out of room to house first-years in the Yard. What will the administration do when 1,000 extra seniors and freshmen return in 2021, or 2022, or 202[insert digit here] when things get back to normal?
The university could try to compel students to endure another semester on Zoom. I’m not so sure about the contractual obligations, but as a thought experiment, the administration could charge full (or even just some) tuition to students taking gap years, making it a very costly venture. Perhaps the College, if it were feeling particularly desperate, might try to make financial aid available only for the first eight semesters of a student’s time in college (excluding time-off for medical reasons). Or it might mandate that anyone who wants to take a single gap year take a minimum of two or three, to disincentivize people from waiting it out. Admission to the College in the future could be contingent upon a high school senior’s willingness to take two or three gap years, to allow for a buffer of current students who elect not to graduate on time.
I hope that the College won't resort to any of the above. But if the semester is online — even partially — there will be a logistical nightmare facing any return to campus. Maybe the next in-person Ec 10 will have 2,000 students and be held on the lawn in front of Widener.
These are all points on the full distribution of possibilities that the College will have to consider. I share the sentiment of the Editorial Board; I don’t envy them as they make a difficult call, for which no good options exist. But in this time — when we are living through a pandemic that would have been inconceivable in a movie just months ago — there is one thing that our administration should not lack: a failure of imagination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Soon after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced that he will drop from the 2020 Democratic primary race, he endorsed the newly minted presumptive Democratic nominee — former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Since the race has narrowed, Harvard political groups have been publicly divided on whether to support Biden’s candidacy. One group, Harvard College Students for Bernie, took to Twitter to publicly announce that the group will not endorse the former Vice President.
Harvard for Bernie has established itself as a durable organizing body, with considerable life outside of the confines of the 2020 election. Its activities have extended to organizing panels on the future of socialism post-Bernie and launching a “pressure campaign” under the Harvard for Bernie moniker to pressure Harvard into providing its workers with adequate paid sick leave, hazard pay, and personal protective equipment, or PPE. Additionally, Harvard for Bernie has remained remarkably steadfast in its stance despite severe criticism. In the aftermath of their decision, the group faced opponents such as Harvard College Students for Biden who suggested that the lack of an endorsement is akin to “sidelining this election” and “a vote for Trump.” Rather than back down after receiving this criticism, Harvard for Bernie pinned the tweet — an example of the staunch, nonconforming, and likely enduring politics Bernie’s progressive ideas have animated in many of his supporters.
What we find most interesting about this exchange — rising above the circumstances of any specific Twitter beef or even the philosophical and tactical debate around when to coalesce around a given candidate — is the lesson that the unwillingness of these organizers to endorse Biden should teach establishment, center-left groups, both on campus and nationwide. The profound level of disaffection the progressive left feels with politics as usual and their dedication to changing this paradigm will not disappear overnight.
That disaffection came through in the Democratic primary, but it has shown itself a powerful force behind expressions of discontent closer to home, as embodied in the activist spirit of the Harvard-Yale divestment protests.
Come November, many supporters of Sanders uncertain now may ultimately end up voting (perhaps begrudgingly) for Biden. But, as Harvard for Bernie’s refusal to endorse Biden illustrates, their support is not a given. Constructive dialogue between these two factions of the Democratic Party — the center-left and the progressive left — must occur between now and the general election if the two groups are to be reconciled.
Maintaining any expectation that progressives will by default fall in line, given evidence that this is just not the case, will only prove disastrous for the Democratic Party. A conversation about the soul of the party awaits, and failure to engage with the Harvard for Bernies of the political landscape seems doomed to perpetuate existing divisions.
Even beyond the campaign trail, recognition of the progressive left’s lasting appetite for activism and contestation has implications for political dialogue on campus, too, once we return. Though our time sharing a physical space has been interrupted, activist fervor in our community — from seeking better working conditions to fossil fuel divestment — remains undimmed.
Just as it may on the national political scene, failure to seek reconciliation, engagement, and genuine compromise with activist and progressive forces may leave lasting divisions, with lasting consequences.

Zoe J. DeMasi had just begun to catch up at school. The assisted hearing device she had gotten earlier this year allowed her to finally enjoy third grade; in the past, she missed between quarter to a half of what her classmates said. But now that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced her Oregon elementary school to close, she hasn’t heard any of their voices in a month.
She completes pages of a school-issued workbook and video chats with her teacher once a week in lieu of classes. Her mother, Monica H. DeMasi, squeezes in time between hospital shifts to read to her and work through math problems.
Monica worries that without a curriculum, Zoe and her classmates will fall behind in their subjects. Zoe, in particular, relied on additional support from her teachers in school.
“[Her current education] is in no way comparable to what she’d be learning at school,” Monica says.
She and her husband have been scouring Facebook groups for children with ADHD to search for online resources. To replicate the structure of school at home, Zoe meets with Saherish S. Surani, a volunteer tutor, three times a week. They read comics on Scholastic Kids and play addition and multiplication games on Zoom.
Surani, a junior at Tufts University, says she understands the disruption Zoe is facing. She herself was “living abroad in a ship, pretty much in a new country every week” when her university abruptly told her and other students to return home last month. The two bond over the fact that they use the same hearing aid; Zoe has never met someone else with a hearing impairment.
Spread across the country, Surani and Zoe are one of hundreds of pairs of students just like them. Jasmine and Esther are reading the Harry Potter series together. Jessie and Isabelle are reviewing SAT math problems, though it is difficult over the phone. Kevin is preparing to recite Shakespeare to Jake to improve his public speaking skills. They are all members of CovEducation, a nascent program pairing K-12 students with college-aged tutors for the remainder of this severely disrupted school year.
Evelyn Wong ’21 created CovEd in the days after Harvard College students were asked to leave campus, while she was packing her belongings and preparing to return home. As she saw spreadsheets circulating to provide college students with emergency housing and storage, her thoughts turned to younger students hit by school shutdowns around the nation.
“A bunch of the community came together to create these sheets and just [tried] to help out,” Wong says. She began reaching out to friends with a Google Form that would pair younger students with college mentors to provide tutoring and educational support.
The cause spread quickly on Facebook, and one Google Form soon turned into a full-fledged website and a team of student leaders from 45 states and dozens of universities. In just over a month, the organization has paired over one thousand mentors and mentees.
Daniela R. Velez, a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and CovEd’s head of outreach, says many stressed parents look to the program for remedial academic support for young children and an “academic boost” for older ones applying to college.
Claudia B. Nuss, a high school junior from North Carolina, is concerned that she hasn’t completed all her testing for college admissions. She sees her weekly sessions as an opportunity to talk to someone about her concerns for the future. “I [have] really started to miss my friends,” she says. “It’s difficult not having someone to talk to face-to-face.”
Velez emphasizes that the organization aims to “maximize impact” rather than the number of sign-ups. CovEd intends to serve low-income students who are struggling the most with the sudden transition to virtual schooling. They have partnered with the Harvard Educational Studies secondary field, the Phillips Brooks House Association, and Professor Katherine K. Merseth, who teaches the popular General Education course “Gen Ed 1076: Equity and Excellence in K-12 American Schools.”
The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequities in education, Merseth says. Some students do not have laptops or internet access to complete their assignments. For others, their parents may be unable to provide academic help due to a language barrier or busy work schedule.
“If you do have a parent who has some social capital, who’s been working with you, who asks you interesting questions, those children will have progressed. But if [they] have a parent who is distracted by the necessities of life, they won’t,” Merseth says.
To overcome these obstacles, CovEd works with some students over the phone and encourages them to get free WiFi from Spectrum or borrow Chromebooks from their schools. Members are also exploring ways to partner with local school boards to recruit students from rural areas and to establish laptop-sharing programs.
Online learning has turned out much better than expected, Merseth says, thanks in part to resources like CovEd. Still, she acknowledges, it’s a poor substitute for face to face learning.
“The entire nation will have to accept a new normal,” she says.

Sami F. Kader is standing in front of a green screen that reads “Sami’s Circuit” in large block letters. He is tall and barrel-chested with a strong jawline. He is wearing a limited-run Stuck at Home Edition t-shirt that says “Never Give Up” across the chest. “Today, I think we should go to outer space,” Kader exclaims, his authoritative voice booming like a caricature of a superhero’s. As he says the words “outer space,” Kader’s already Superman-esque voice distorts into a deeper, synthesized version.
A disembodied announcer’s voice starts a countdown in the background, and the Sami’s Circuit logo begins to shake and blasts off the screen. It sounds as if he sampled the take-off hissing from the Apollo missions. The screen transitions, exploding into a vibrant nebula.
The average five-year-old might not realize that this circuit workout live stream is being broadcasted from Kader’s mother’s house.
As he moves to the floor, he excitedly suggests that we exercise here, in the vacuum of space. We start with a two-minute butterfly stretch.
***
Before California’s statewide lockdown, Kader’s day job was as a children’s motivational speaker, traveling to elementary schools across California to speak about the importance of self-esteem and an active lifestyle. Following the ongoing shutdown of most California schools since March 18, Kader’s in-person assemblies are no longer possible.
For the past month, Kader has live streamed workouts from green screen locations including “Under the Sea,” Egypt, France, London, “A Waterfall,” the North Pole, and Hawaii. For his French workout, live streamed to tens of thousands of homes across the country, Kader sports a drawn-on mustache and holds a baguette.
“I love French bread! You know, I don’t normally eat bread all the time, but when I’m in France, you eat French bread,” he says,taking a comically large bite.
He continues, “In France, it’s not actually called French bread, it’s called ‘la bread.’” If the line is a subtle homage to Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction,” it most likely goes over the heads of most of his elementary school-aged viewers.
On any given day, Kader would spend between 12 and 15 hours going from one school to the next, speaking in front of crowds of assembled children and leading them in exercises. But Kader’s transformation into a regular component of many California schools wasn’t always the plan.
At the schools he frequents most often, those nearest to his home in suburbs of Sacramento, students might see him as many as four times in one year. Even though I’m over the age of 11 these days, Kader is still inescapable. Dozens of kids at the summer camps where I used to work as a counselor had Sami’s Circuit water bottles or bracelets or t-shirts. You just couldn’t get away from this guy.
That’s why, before I even speak with him over the phone, I already know much of his story — I’ve heard him give motivational speeches twice.
He tells crowds that in his sophomore year of high school, he weighed more than 300 pounds, was frequently bullied, and had poor self-esteem. He says that a family friend intervened and “saved” his life, introducing him to healthy eating and exercise. By his senior year, he had lost 100 pounds.
After graduating from high school, Kader began working as a trainer at a local gym. While he credits his weight loss photos with securing the job, he explains that at the time, he didn’t think he’d be very good at training others. During these same years, Kader was still struggling with his body image and self-esteem, even after losing such a significant amount of weight. He explains that it took many years of therapy to feel better about the change in his body.
Those years after high school have shaped how Kader communicates about health to his youth audiences. In his speeches, he doesn’t only focus on his weight loss. Instead, Kader emphasizes the importance of overcoming “negative self talk” and never giving up.
Kader attempts to de-link “looks or a number on a scale” from having “a happy, healthy life.”. But while Kader is careful not to equate weight loss with happiness or self-esteem, he acknowledges that mental and physical well-being are linked.
“The fact is, when you get up off the couch and you move, you’re gonna put yourself in a better place mentally. And the byproduct of that is physical,” he says.
Now, during a statewide lockdown, Kader says he feels a specific obligation to provide kids an opportunity to get off the couch.
***
After realizing he wouldn’t be able to continue to speak at schools, Kader received a message from a teacher.
The teacher had issued a request: “Sami, the kids are really scared and nervous right now,” he recalls them saying. “[They] really need to hear from you right now.”
He took this as a call to action. Luckily, he tells me that he had a vision that he needed to buy a camera months before the lockdown began. Though he had initially thought of live streaming as a tool that could enable him to reach more children, it has now become his sole medium of communicating with his audience.
Kader announced his live streaming decision on Facebook a short time later. The post was seen by over 150,000 people and shared over a thousand times.
The first week of live streaming was “one of the hardest weeks of my life,” he says. Like many people around the globe, Kader struggled to balance what he considers his “calling” and the needs of his family.
Just days before his first live stream, Kader and his wife learned that they had lost their unborn son. In the same week, Kader realized that his revenue from speaking at schools had been cut off “indefinitely.”
“By the second week, I realized that it was really taking a toll on my family because they were going through a tough time and I wasn’t there because I was trying to help all these other kids,” Kader reflects. “You’ve got your family and you’ve got your calling, and you’re stuck in the middle.”
Still, Kader feels a duty to persevere through these stressors.“Sometimes if we don’t have a choice, we just do things that we normally wouldn’t do,” Kader says of staying positive and performing for children. “I don’t feel like I have a choice in it. I just feel like I have to keep going.”
“The show must go on,” Kader says.
***
Today, I tune into “Sami in Space!”, the twentieth episode of Kader’s live stream. Even though these videos are mainly targeted towards elementary school-aged kids, I figured that I could use some exercise since I haven’t left my house in weeks.
I have on my favorite high school athletic shirt, and after having followed along with Kader’s stretch and listening to “Sami’s Circuit Volume 1,” I am jazzed to get this workout underway.
We start with squat kicks, which I handle no problem. Next, we move on to the invisible jump rope exercise. Sami grabs two light sticks. (These are for sale as “Invisible Jump Rope Light Sticks” for five dollars on his website.) Regrettably, I do not have my own invisible jump ropes and I will have to make do with the next best thing: imagination.
I manage to push my way through the next few exercises, but by the time we get to chair dips, I have to acknowledge that the workout is kicking my ass. Kader frequently reminds viewers to “never give up!” and that if “you are moving, you are doing it right!”, but that does little to help quash the feeling that somewhere, out there, some eight-year-old is crushing me at this workout.
Mercifully, the first round of the workout ends, and I am able to catch my breath. During a short break before we start exercising again, Kader receives a note from off-screen. It is from his wife, who says that his workouts have been way too easy as of late and demands that Kader step it up.
Come on, help a guy out! I barely made it through round one. For the love of God, don’t make round two any harder.
I manage to finish the workout, but I will be extremely sore for the next three days. That being said, I can at least take some solace in the fact that I hit my Apple Watch movement goal for the day.

Just three days after dropping his single “A Lot,” the rapper 21 Savage was detained by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency on the grounds that he had overstayed an expired visa. Deportation would likely prevent him from being present to receive the Grammy he would eventually win for “A Lot” and prevented the blossoming of his rumored relationship with a mystery Harvard student.
Luckily, 21 Savage’s legal team intervened, including Alex B. Spiro, the Harvard Law School alumnus Jay-Z had hired to defend him. After nine days in custody, 21 Savage was released.
This wasn’t Spiro’s first high-profile case — or his last.
To name a few, he’s represented tennis star Naomi Osaka, Beyonce’s husband Jay-Z, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, and a slew of NFL and NBA athletes. Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, has also defended more controversial figures, including Elon Musk and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.
But he didn’t start out a defense attorney — or even a lawyer at all. During his undergraduate years at Tufts University, he was considering medical school. But, like many other ex-premeds, he found himself drawn to the humanities.
After college, he worked at McLean Hospital, developing an educational program for children with Asperger’s syndrome. But during this experience, he came to see law as a quicker and more direct way to advocate for the issues he cared about.
“Maybe I’m more of an advocate than a scientist. And so one thing led to another, and I applied to law school,” Spiro says.
Spiro started at Harvard Law School in 2005. “[It] sort of gave me a sense of how the world works underneath,” Spiro says. “I volunteered at the clinics and did a lot of work advocating on behalf of people that had disabilities. And that just instilled in me a further desire to become a litigator and to take on issues I thought were important.”
Once Spiro graduated, he started out as a prosecutor in Manhattan, a move he believes is part of a “very natural” career path. In his time with the New York County’s District Attorney’s Office, he prosecuted, among others, infamous serial killer Rodney J. Alcala, better known as the “Dating Game Killer” for his appearance on the television game show during his 1970s spree.
But during this time, Spiro found himself leaning toward becoming a defense attorney. “[Defense] lends itself to helping people on their darkest day,” he says, and it allows attorneys to “[think] through why people do the things they do.”
In 2013, Spiro became a defense lawyer for Brafman & Associates, a firm with a high-profile clientele. Given that many of his clients and cases would be publicly scrutinized, his strategy changed.
“When a case is in the public eye, you have to be conscious of that when you’re litigating it. And how you deal with that and interact with the court of public opinion matters,” he stated. “The First Amendment is the very first one because everybody gets to see everything that happens inside of a courtroom.”
Arguably, Spiro’s first big case at Brafman would come in 2014 when rapper Bobby Shmurda was arrested and charged on multiple counts of weapons possession. A meme, “Free Bobby Shmurda,” took off in hip hop circles, while Spiro argued to lower Shmurda’s sentence in the courtroom.
“I got a ‘Free Bobby Shmurda’ t-shirt, and I’m happy that he’s coming home soon,” Spiro chuckles. Shmurda is set to be released from prison as early as December of this year.
But the court of public opinion has not always been on Spiro’s side. In one highly publicized case, a prosecutor called him an “asshole” in the courtroom. But in dealing with criticism, Spiro says he remains unphased. “Don’t get caught up in it; you’ll be like, you know, Don Quixote chasing windmills. Stay on task. Do right and right shall prevail,” Spiro says.
Spiro also remains involved in the Harvard Law School sphere, teaching a winter course alongside law professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. in trial advocacy, and chairing an HLS-born program, the Fair Punishment Project. But his schedule — or lack thereof — prevents him from getting more involved.
“I have no schedule. I have no set sleeping time. I have no nothing,” he says. “It’s responding to whatever the urgency is in that moment and juggling a lot of things at once and trying to navigate complicated situations.”
But his busy schedule has its upsides — from the opportunity to advocate for people on their “darkest days,” to the “everyday funny anecdotes” he collects while working with famous — and sometimes infamous — clients. In true lawyer fashion, though, he couldn’t share them — client confidentiality and all.
Correction: April 24, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Spiro represented the rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine.

Teng Biao, who has cropped black hair and rectangular, wire-framed glasses, was preparing to drive to Logan International Airport on March 10, 2015, when he received a phone call from a “powerful person” at Harvard.
Teng was then a visiting fellow at Harvard Law School. A Chinese dissident and human rights lawyer, he has criticized the Chinese Communist Party for human rights violations since the early 2000s.
“Because of my work, I was disbarred and put on a ban from teaching, and eventually fired from [China University of Political Science and Law] University,” Teng says. “I was put under house arrest from time to time, and disappeared a few times — kidnapped by Chinese secret police, and detained and tortured.”
In February 2011, Teng and several other human rights advocates met in Beijing to discuss the arrest of another dissident, Chen Guangcheng. Teng “disappeared” three days later; the Chinese government released him in April after U.S. officials voiced concerns about Teng’s detention.
In 2013, Teng secured a position at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. But as China began arresting members of the New Citizens’ Movement — an activist network which Teng helped create — Teng realized he was in physical danger and would be detained again if he returned to the mainland.
That year, Human Rights Watch recommended Teng to the Scholars at Risk program, which provided him funding and an offer to be a visiting scholar at the Harvard Law School. He accepted, arriving in September.
“I am grateful that Harvard [could] host me for a year,” Teng says. “It’s not easy, because I’m a dissident very, very critical of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Early in 2015, Teng and Chen Guangcheng, who had by then been released from Chinese custody, had planned to cross paths again. Working with Harvard graduates, Teng had scheduled an event to be hosted at Harvard in late March or early April, during which he and Chen would speak about their experiences as dissidents.
But on Feb. 11, the powerful person at Harvard gave Teng the first call.
“He told me to cancel the talk,” Teng says. “He told me the time we were supposed to give our talk, that day was when the Harvard president would fly back from Beijing. And a few weeks before that, the Harvard president was meeting Xi Jinping.” The administrator told him hosting an event with two Chinese dissidents only days after a historic meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then University President Drew G. Faust would “embarrass” Harvard, Teng recalls.
“It was not about the title or the topics — but because of ourselves,” Teng says. “We ourselves are sensitive.”
Teng and the other organizers persisted, hoping they could find another Harvard venue. “We tried to avoid him, but eventually we realized we were not able to,” he says.
The second phone call, on March 10, was a formal and final warning. The powerful person called Teng to his office and told him the event would embarrass the University and potentially threaten the continuation of collaborative programs and joint research with China. The administrator asked Teng to “postpone” the event, and Teng finally agreed.
“Postpone is a polite word,” Teng recalls. “They never invited us to give a talk after that.”
Chen Guangcheng puts it more bluntly. “What he meant was that it was going to be postponed indefinitely,” he explains, through an interpreter. “It was just another way to cancel it completely.”
That powerful person also made Teng promise to keep the cancellation a secret, and at the time Teng told almost nobody. Chen was particularly struck by this self-censorship. “It seemed really strange to me at the time, because this is not what Teng Biao is like when he’s back in China,” Chen says. “He’s very outspoken.”
Though Teng has since then told journalists about the incident, he has refused to reveal the powerful person’s identity and again declined to identify him to me, citing fears of potential employment retaliation.
However, sources familiar with the incident speaking under the condition of anonymity confirmed that that person was Professor William P. Alford, Harvard Law School’s Vice Dean for International Legal Studies. Throughout his career, Alford has met with current and past presidents of China and Taiwan and spoken at the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party.
“Having for years served on the Scholars at Risk Committee and for decades hosted a broad range of scholars and law related activists from China at HLS, I tried to make Dr. Teng’s time here academically fruitful,” Alford wrote in an emailed statement. “I invited him to speak in my class around the time in question, introduced him to colleagues and met with him frequently about his research, his plans, and his family. I did ask that he schedule the event in question after our University President had left Beijing.”
In those first few months of 2015, Harvard’s international presence and collaboration efforts came into conflict with its stated commitment to academic freedom. In this seemingly isolated clash, the former won — but that doesn’t seem to generally be the case.
Harvard has for years maintained a unique and symbiotic relationship with China, born out of a thick network of decades-old, grassroots connections. From its inception, the relationship has been inherently political, but Harvard has not refrained from criticizing the Chinese Communist Party. During his visit to Beijing last March, for instance, University President Lawrence S. Bacow read a Uighur poem in defense of academic freedom in his speech at Peking University; the same day, he had an audience with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Though the Harvard-China relationship always entailed mutual benefit, it was for decades asymmetrical — China needed Harvard more than Harvard needed China, which perhaps gave the University more leeway to be critical of the Chinese government.
But over the past decade, China’s global influence has grown dramatically. In 2010, China became the world’s second-largest economy; in 2018, it surpassed the U.S. in terms of scientific papers published. Escalating tensions have accompanied this shift in global power, threatening to compromise Harvard and China’s special relationship: Xi has cracked down on dissent both within and outside of China’s borders, and the FBI has launched numerous investigations into alleged Chinese industrial and academic “espionage,” including one into undisclosed Chinese funding sent to the University’s former Chemistry Department Chair, Charles M. Lieber. As the geopolitical and academic balance shifts in China’s favor, the Teng Biao incident may indicate that, at least in some instances, Harvard depends on China more than the other way around.
Mark C. Elliott, Harvard’s Vice Provost for International Affairs, acknowledges that Harvard’s simultaneous engagement with and criticism of the CCP may seem like a paradox to some observers. But, he says, Harvard is not political, nor is it a government — it is a university. This position allows it to provide an open forum for clashing perspectives while still earning the respect of some of the subjects of its criticisms, like Xi.
“[Harvard] does not take a political position on anything. It takes positions on matters relating to academic freedom,” Elliott says. “I sometimes jokingly tell people, ‘Our foreign policy is Veritas.’”
The cancellation of Teng’s event, however, revealed that the University isn’t immune from the CCP’s reach. It also served as a reminder that Harvard’s relationship with China doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Even if higher education at times provides an alternative space for international dialogue and informal critique, the University cannot categorically evade the conflicting interests of state and academia, of politics and truth.
Harvard first hired a Chinese language professor in 1879 and by 1936 had graduated more than 1,000 Chinese international students. But most of the University’s present-day engagement with China traces back only a few decades. Following China’s Communist Revolution, CCP policies banning most foreign academics had nearly severed the relationship. Only after Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 reforms did Chinese universities reopen their doors to western academics, and Harvard was among the first to enter, embarking on a decades-long road of modernizing Chinese universities, training China’s top academics, and shaping Chinese policy.
In 1978, School of Public Health Professor William C. Hsiao traveled to China to visit family. Howard H. Hiatt, then Dean of the School of Public Health, was interested in establishing an institution-to-institution relationship with China, and he asked Hsiao to explore any possibilities.
While in Beijing, Hsiao visited China’s Ministry of Health, which at the time had only a few dozen employees. “Right away I was taken to the minister’s office,” Hsiao recalls, where he expressed Hiatt’s interest.
“Of course the minister knew Harvard’s name,” Hsiao says. “He said, ‘This is a wonderful idea.’” The Ministry of Health seized the opportunity, connecting Harvard with Shanghai First Medical University and initiating joint research projects and a series of faculty exchanges. This in turn sparked further collaboration, creating a dense and self-perpetuating network.
The project survives today as the Harvard China Health Partnership, the first institution-to-institution relationship between an American university and a Chinese one.
Though the HCHP is an institutional effort, it was rooted in individual relationships, a trend that continued as other Harvard professors began conducting research in mainland China. Ezra F. Vogel, who directed the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies from 1972 to 1977, was able to study in China for the first time in 1980. Arthur M. Kleinman, a Harvard physician and anthropologist, transferred his work from Taiwan to mainland China in 1978 and introduced the modern notion of clinical depression to the mainland in 1980.
“Most of our collaborations [with China] are from the bottom up,” says Professor William C. Kirby, a former director of the Fairbank Center and the current chair of the Harvard China Fund. A Harvard professor and a Tsinghua professor might share mutual research interests and begin working together; a Harvard professor’s Chinese postdoctoral students might help their advisor connect with other Chinese academics.
In 1979, Shanghai First Medical University sent four of their top academics to Harvard. Two would train in molecular biology, one would learn health policy, and the last would study oncology — disciplines, Hsiao says, that were almost non-existent in China at the time. Each of these first four professors went on to become high-ranking university administrators, developing their respective fields in China. Only one Harvard faculty member went to Shanghai in that initial exchange.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Harvard professors were often helping China build capacity and training Chinese faculty, in disciplines ranging from public health policy, to environmental science, to psychiatry. Hsiao began teaching Chinese scholars from basics: how to design a survey, how to administer a hospital. “We trained the first generation of Chinese faculty members in health policy and management,” Hsiao says. “Then we trained the second generation.”
That capacity building extended from university departments to government policy. Not even a decade after his first meeting with leaders of China’s Ministry of Health, Hsiao found himself at lunch with the ministry’s new head, a clinician named Chen Minzhang, in 1987.
“We really hit it off,” Hsiao recalls. The new Minister of Health appreciated Hsiao’s unvarnished honesty in enumerating problems with China’s public health system. “Under an authoritarian regime, people do not want to usually tell you the bad news,” Hsiao says. “They only want to praise what you’re doing well. As a person from another country, I thought I could tell the Chinese the truth.” Universities have historically provided such alternative spaces for honest discussions within regimes hostile to criticism — what Kirby characterizes as a sort of “intellectual safety valve.”
As the lunch ended, Hsiao recalls Chen telling him, “Professor Hsiao, I do not know, ‘What is policy?’ I’m a clinician, I know how to treat patients.” Following that meeting, the School of Public Health launched its first executive education programs for officials in China’s Ministry of Health, as well as the heads of health in each of China’s 31 provinces, helping lay the groundwork for modern Chinese health policy.
The asymmetry of Harvard-China exchanges in the later decades of the 20th century tipped far in the University’s favor — the development of Chinese universities and government bodies depended on Harvard’s knowledge and expertise. Harvard, in turn, did not lack incentives to engage its Chinese counterparts.
In part because of China’s dependence on the University, Harvard and its scholars gained greater access to the largest potential pool of academic talent in the world; to data on pressing issues, from an enormous population living in an up-and-coming economic superpower; to the world’s longest continuous historical archive. Perhaps most importantly, Harvard rekindled a relationship largely cut off by the Communist Revolution, establishing a trust and rapport with China that only select American universities enjoy today.
For six days in the fall of 1997, for the first time in over a decade, the Chinese head of state — then President Jiang Zemin — paid a state visit to the U.S. During his trip, Jiang met with America’s political, economic, and academic leadership: he spoke with President Bill Clinton, toured IBM and Bell Labs, and visited Harvard.
In the late 1990s, many Americans vividly remembered the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and wanted little to do with China. Vogel, then director of the Fairbank Center, thought the political circumstances meant there should be as much communication with China as possible.
He and another professor, Ning Wang, began looking for ways to increase contact. Through Wang’s connections, they learned that Jiang was planning a trip to the U.S. When he was a younger official, Jiang had been on a delegation that passed through Harvard, and “he himself wanted to come [again],” Vogel says.
On Nov. 1, Jiang spoke before a packed Sanders Theater, with another 4,000 people lining the streets. In his speech, Jiang lauded recent Chinese reforms and emphasized that China needed to continue learning from America, especially praising Harvard’s historic relationship with China: “The Chinese educational, scientific and cultural communities have all along maintained academic exchanges with this university,” he said.
Jiang’s speech emphasized the importance of academic and international collaboration to China’s development. But the massive protests surrounding the theater, decrying the “Three Terrible T’s” of Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen, showed the political controversy inevitably associated with the People’s Republic of China, a nation the west had condemned for decades.
Harvard, however, had no intention of providing Jiang with a soapbox: The University forced China’s president to answer 15 minutes of unrehearsed questions. “That way it would not be just a session where we’re allowing the Chinese to express their views,” Vogel recalls.
Jiang ended his speech by extending an invitation to President Neil L. Rudenstine to visit China, and the two men met in Beijing the following March. In his own speech at Peking University, Rudenstine said, “Universities can work to create ‘neutral spaces’ for serious discussion, based on a shared commitment to free inquiry, to rigorous research and analysis, and to open dialogue” — at a time when the international community was condemning China, Rudenstine proposed Harvard as a safety valve that could allow for dialogue to continue.
The following year, Rudenstine organized a meeting between leaders of top Chinese and American universities, where attendees discussed basic principles for further international collaboration among institutions of higher education.
“The leaders of Chinese universities, the people with whom we interact by and large, much more broadly share our values than not,” says Kirby, who helped organize the meeting. “There is a long history of association between Chinese universities and American universities before 1949, before the Communist Revolution. Part of this [meeting] was to re-establish those kinds of things.”
Today, scholars from across Harvard’s schools and disciplines want to study in China or work with Chinese universities. According to Kleinman, who directed the Harvard University Asia Center for eight years, over the past 50 years, collaboration expanded from the traditional China Studies focus on the humanities to include fields such as anthropology, sociology, health policy, and economics.
“And then in the last 30 years, it’s opened up much broader, and the sciences, applied sciences, the professional schools all have developed very substantial interactions with China,” he says. “We’re talking about hundreds of scholars across Harvard University that have had active research with Chinese institutions.”
As Chinese universities were re-entering the international community, the Chinese state was doing the same. Deng’s market reforms began to modernize China’s economy, and China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. From 1976 to 2019, the Chinese economy did not contract.
A significant factor in China’s rise has been investing in universities, allowing the PRC to craft better policies, innovate new technologies, and elevate its international status. “They have self-consciously tried to make China part of the global system of higher education,” Kirby says.
The PRC has invested trillions of dollars over the past 20 years to modernize its higher education system. Once at a deficit — in terms of finances, faculty, and quality of scholarship across most disciplines — China and its universities have ascended global rankings to rival established universities in Europe and North America.
“In the past it used to be that they had nobody, and we brought the ideas, the methods, and produced the findings. But now they have plenty of good people doing good research,” Kleinman says. Research is no longer “neocolonial,” he says, but truly collaborative: “What we learn in China is as important for here, in the U.S., as it is in China.”
The balance of power that for decades undergirded the Harvard-China relationship may have begun to shift in recent years. As China’s economy and higher education system have developed, Harvard has continued building collaborative relationships, but perhaps out of necessity — many of the world’s top academics, labs, and studies, not to mention funding, are now in China. And where China was once almost devoid of foreign scholars, interest in China is now ubiquitous: Harvard competes with top universities from across the world for access to Chinese talent and resources.
Even the influence of the Harvard China Health Partnership has declined, says Professor Winnie Yip, the partnership’s current director. But it has not vanished, she explains, due to a widespread network of research collaborations and close relationships with high levels of government.
The HCHP continues to prove itself uniquely useful to Chinese policy-makers, in particular through its “social experiment” model — implementing and testing large-scale policies with local governments, something other universities do not or cannot attempt. “China watches very carefully, who does surveys or may find secrets about China, but they trust us, that we will not try to undermine China,” Hsiao says. “That’s where trust is such an important thing, and it takes decades to build up that relationship.”
To strengthen these relationships, the University created the Harvard China Fund in 2006, initially providing $15 million and committing another $50 million over the next decade to advance the interests of students and faculty, as well as “Harvard’s presence,” in China. In 2011, the Harvard China Fund opened a center in Shanghai to help faculty host events.
“China is home to many of the best and fastest growing research universities in the world today,” Kirby says. “If we are to remain a great research university, you have to find means of collaborating with others.”
The number of Chinese students and scholars at Harvard has increased each year since 2012. Harvard and Chinese scholars regularly co-author groundbreaking research. The Business School, Kennedy School, School of Public Health, and Medical School all provide executive training programs for Chinese philanthropists, business leaders, officials, doctors, and more. Every Harvard president since Rudenstine has visited China, met with the Chinese president, and given a public speech at a major Chinese university.
Of course, China and its universities continue to have a vested interest in working with Harvard and its scholars, often considered global standard-bearers of academic excellence. “[China is] investing a huge amount in higher education,” Professor Elizabeth J. Perry, a former director of the Fairbank Center and current director of the Yenching Institute, says. “I think they appreciate competition in the 21st century is going to hinge in large part on innovation. And innovation is going to hinge on having world class universities, and Harvard is generally regarded as a world class university. And so China wants to know what’s going on here.”
Mutual benefit and decades-old trust, however, won’t guarantee the future of the Harvard-China relationship. If China’s economic and academic ascent has led to more fruitful and equal academic cooperations, this rise has also been perceived by some American policymakers and leaders as a threat to American hegemony.
Xiao Lu, a Chinese climate scientist, joined Professor Daniel Jacob’s Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group as a postdoctoral fellow this past October after waiting a month for his visa application to undergo “administrative processing.” He received a one-year visa that, once expired, does not permit re-entry to the U.S., effectively barring him from visiting home.
Lu’s predicament, like that of the thousands of visiting Chinese scholars in the U.S. who use the same visa, is in part the byproduct of the Trump administration’s aggressive stance toward China, stoked by the PRC’s increasing relative power. Since 2018, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray has warned repeatedly about the Chinese state using intellectual espionage to “steal its way up the economic ladder,” which he deems “the broadest, most challenging, most significant threat we face as a country.” Wray is especially hostile toward Chinese scholars: “We know they use some Chinese students in the U.S. as nontraditional collectors of our intellectual property,” he accused at a conference in February.
“Some of my friends were even rejected or suspended for half a year. That’s really a problem,” Lu says — they have to start research late, or even find an alternative program. “My plan is that if I can go back before the expiration of this visa, [I will] visit my family, but if I cannot go back before the expiration, I have to stay here.”
The FBI currently has about 1,000 investigations into Chinese technology theft in the U.S. The investigations have especially focused on scholars associated with the Thousand Talents Program, a recruitment system China has used since 2008 to attract talented Chinese and foreign academics overseas, and which the Bureau alleges is a mechanism for siphoning American innovation.
The federal government’s hostility toward Chinese academics reflects increasing American anxiety over China’s growing technological and economic prowess. Professor Graham T. Allison, a leading national security analyst with a focus on China, sees the FBI investigations as signs of “a classical Thucydides rivalry, in which a meteoric rising China is threatening to displace the U.S. as a world power.” Such rivalries, he adds, have historically led to war.
In recent years, the Chinese government has poured money into research universities, with its spending on research and development increasing by 17 percent on average each year since 2000, compared to a roughly four percent average increase in the U.S. over the same period. The Thousand Talents Program offers a large salary, healthcare, and research funding in a nation whose government has consistently signaled a commitment to scientific research. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has repeatedly proposed cutting research funding by billions of dollars.
In 2008, when Thousand Talents began, China submitted roughly half as many patent applications as the U.S.; a decade later, China submitted three times as many. International talent, an engine of American innovation in cutting-edge science, is leaving: Total foreign enrollment in U.S. universities has dropped since 2016, and increasing numbers of visiting Chinese scholars return home. China leads the way on 5G cell phone service and artificial intelligence. Though there have been high-profile incidents of Chinese nationals taking privileged information from the U.S., China’s commitment to scientific research signals that it isn’t merely “stealing its way up the economic ladder,” as Wray suggests.
Given the perception of China threatening American technological leadership, the next question is, “How do we respond as a nation?”, says Professor Christopher W. Stubbs, Harvard FAS Dean of Science. “One response would be to say, ‘Okay, we have a new competitor, let’s outcompete them by being smarter, being more agile, and investing more resources.’ That’s one path forward. Another path forward is to try to erect barriers.”
Irrespective of geopolitical tensions, the FBI’s particular assault on academia has drawn its own criticism. “I don’t even understand the term ‘academic espionage,’” Elliott says. “Espionage involves stealing secrets, something you’re trying to keep private or away from someone. But unlike in a company, where you have inventions and things that you patent and you want to protect and you don’t want anybody else to see, for academics the goal is to publish what you have learned. It’s to share.”
Stubbs also says the term “espionage” is misleading. The concern is not about spying, he says, but about Chinese academics not following the unwritten norms of U.S. academia: “individuals taking some element of the scientific process and snagging a piece of it, and running off to some other corner and doing something with it before that reaches the public domain,” Stubbs explains. This violation of academic norms may be a particular threat from China, he says, due to the relationship between government, military, universities, and corporations.
In November, Harvard formed two oversight committees in response to federal investigations into “academic espionage.” One committee scrutinizes sensitive research projects, and the other makes sure FAS policies align with federal guidelines. Stubbs has admitted, however, that Harvard is “limited” in its oversight capabilities.
“[The] process of disclosure and approval is something that we expect all faculty and all members of our academic community to go through,” Stubbs says. “I think one of the things that we’re struggling with is instances of non-disclosure” — because such instances are inherently clandestine, they are difficult to identify.
This past winter, Harvard became directly and publicly embroiled in the FBI’s investigations into Chinese “academic espionage.” Zaosong Zheng, an HMS-affiliated researcher from China, was arrested in December at Logan for trying to smuggle 21 vials of sensitive biological material out of the country. Just over a month later, federal prosecutors charged Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber of not disclosing contracts with and funding received from the Chinese government. An FBI agent characterized the Lieber and Zheng incidents as “manifestations of the China threat.”
Lieber, in 2011, formed a joint nanotechnology lab with the Wuhan University of Technology without authority on behalf of Harvard. A court affidavit also alleges that Lieber did not report payments he was receiving through the Thousand Talents Program.
Under an agreement with WUT, under which he received a salary, Lieber was directed “to guide the advancement of disciplines or scientific research institutes to become first class disciplines or scientific research institutes in China or the world, especially in frontier areas” — a capacity-building function the FBI has characterized as quasi-treasonous.
Though Lieber’s arrest made national headlines, Stubbs says the incident has not triggered any changes in the work Harvard has done over the past two years to strengthen internal review processes.
And though the Thousand Talents Program has been much maligned in the wake of Lieber’s arrest, it is not unusual for nations to recruit foreign talent. Many other countries, such as Britain, Germany, and France, have invested tens of millions of dollars in national funds to recruit foreign researchers. Indeed, Chinese talent is a key benefit of the Harvard-China relationship.
“China’s economic rise has fundamentally transformed the way that our classrooms look,” Elliott says. Having access to Chinese scholars and students, drawn from the world’s largest population, has tremendous potential upsides. “When you’re able to include 1.4 billion [people] in your talent pool, you’re going to get a lot more good talent in the mix,” he adds.
Even absent “Thucydides rivalry”-induced war, FBI investigations have already had a grave effect on those members of China’s talent pool at the University.
“I worry that there is — as there was in the 1950s — a racialist attitude on the part of the American government when it looks at scientists and graduate students of Chinese and East Asian background,” Kirby says.
One visiting Chinese professor at Harvard, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of her comments, says fear permeates conversations among Chinese scholars in the U.S. “We discuss internally, we have those WeChat groups, people think these tensions between the U.S. and China could impact the normal collaboration between China and the U.S,” she says. “It causes fear and nerves.”
The many layers of anxiety — indeterminate periods of administrative processing, delayed starts to research, inability to visit home, racialized treatment — may dissuade Chinese scholars from studying in the U.S., or at least make them hesitate. The trend of decreasing numbers of Chinese students at American universities has not yet been reflected at Harvard, perhaps as a result of the long history of visiting scholars and bottom-up collaborations.
“That would really be tragic, if there was any degradation in our ability to work with Chinese students,” says Jacob, who runs a joint lab for air quality with Nanjing University for Information Science & Technology. Working with China on climate change and air quality is especially important because of the large amounts of pollution in China and the huge amount of resources China invests in tackling these problems, Jacob says.
The Chinese graduate students and postdocs I spoke with gushed about doing research at Harvard, pointing to excellent faculty, abundant resources, and enriching seminars. “Peking University also has weekly seminars, but the level will be quite lower than the standard at Harvard,” Lu says. “That’s the difference between the world famous and nationally famous university.”
Yet when asked specifically about Harvard’s importance and their future plans, the praise was less effusive — in their final estimations, Harvard may not be that special. “I want to go back to China because funding and jobs are similar with those in the U.S.,” Ke Li, another postdoc in Jacob’s group, says.
“[A] postdoc in the U.S. is not that necessary,” Lu says. Friends and colleagues struggling to apply for a visa, he adds, can go to Europe or just stay in China. He himself came to the U.S. specifically to work with Jacob, not because Harvard is generally better than Chinese universities. “For research itself, [working at Harvard or in China] doesn’t have too much difference,” Lu says. “It just depends on the advisor. I don’t think it depends on Harvard or Peking University.” As Chinese universities rise, their American counterparts’ relative prestige — even Harvard’s — falls.
Teng Biao has grown accustomed to the reach of China’s “long arm,” as he calls it — the Chinese government’s attempts to influence and censor scholars and activists not only within its borders, but abroad. In 2016, he alleged that the American Bar Association refused to publish his book on human rights in China due to pressure from the CCP. His wife was fired from her position at a Chinese-owned company in the U.S., where she had worked for 17 years, likely due to Teng’s activism.
“Even in the United States, I was not able to avoid the harassment and punishment from the Chinese government,” he says.
Before Xi’s rise to power, scholarly criticism was an important source of advice for Chinese officials. “Chinese political leaders in modern times have often shown themselves to be intolerant of dissent, and yet the wiser ones have often tried to find means of reading and understanding critique,” Kirby says.
But since Xi became China’s president in 2013, the CCP has shored up party rule, tightening restrictions on academic freedom. Cameras record classes at top universities, professors who publish works critical of the Party have been fired, and critical books are taken off shelves.
“I think it’s absolutely true that there is much greater freedom of expression within the walls of the university than outside those walls,” Kirby says. “And one of the unfortunate things over the last several years under President Xi Jinping, is that those walls have been actually getting tighter and higher.”
In times of geopolitical conflict, such as the current U.S.-China tensions, the academy walls can create crucial spaces to carry out international discussions and level criticism that would otherwise be silenced. People not in the government, but who still interact with their governments, Allison says, “can often explore areas of shared interest better than they could if they were in government, or even explore thoughts that would be radical or even contrary to either the Chinese or American government.”
The instructive analogy, Allison continues, is the Cold War, when science diplomacy between the U.S. and Soviet Union played a key role in launching an internal transformation in the USSR under Mikhael Gorbachev. A similar relationship, or at least fragments of it, may be unfolding today — in the work of the Harvard China Health Partnership, joint climate change labs, Harvard social scientists who study China, and others.
“Our faculty continue to go, and I go, to China to work, to research, also to give public lectures, sometimes on issues that perhaps our Chinese colleagues are not able to talk about so directly themselves,” Kirby says. “And we’re invited to do so perhaps in part because they’re not able to talk about some such issues themselves. It may well be that international university connections such as those with Harvard are a kind of an intellectual safety valve for a system that actually needs some open windows for ideas, but at the moment feels too fearful to allow those windows to be fully open at home.”
But as China’s global power has increased, its government has become better able to extend its “long arm” into campuses overseas — even Harvard’s, it seems, perhaps threatening the University’s academic walls and intellectual safety valves.
“When China became more powerful, it used its economic and political power to try and influence other countries,” Teng says. “The number one priority of the Chinese Communist Party is the one party rule. They want to ensure an international atmosphere which will be in favor of China’s politics.”
In November, 2019, Teng was to speak at Columbia University on a panel titled “Panopticism with Chinese Characteristics.” The event was cancelled, purportedly for bureaucratic reasons, though the panellists believe Chinese Communist Party pressure was responsible. After the University of California, San Diego hosted the Dalai Lama — who has been called a “traitor” by China over his stance on Tibet — at its 2017 commencement, the PRC suspended funding for Chinese scholars seeking to study at UCSD and terminated several collaborative agreements. Chinese officials regularly deliver complaints to universities hosting events on sensitive issues and even offer scholars money to modify research critical of China.
China’s economic and academic rise has made the PRC depend less and less on foreign wealth and expertise, enabling direct interference in foreign universities. Chinese government funding, Chinese students and their tuitions, contracts with Chinese companies, entry into China, collaborating with Chinese scholars, joint programs with Chinese labs and universities — every benefit accompanying China’s rise is also a lever for its long arm, a resource to extend or withdraw. The balance of the asymmetrical relationship has shifted.
“Western institutions, think tanks, universities, they don’t want to anger the Chinese government because they want to keep a good relationship with their Chinese counterparts,” Teng says.
The particular effect of Xi’s tightening of academic walls and extension of the CCP’s long arm on Harvard’s campus extend beyond the cancellation of Teng’s event. Scholars at the Fairbank Center, for instance, have found it more difficult to research Chinese contemporary society and history, two particularly sensitive topics: archives in China are harder to access, Chinese interlocutors are more reticent, and visiting scholars and delegations have been restricted from leaving China.
And, given Harvard’s status in the international academic hierarchy, Chinese authorities may be particularly interested in the University. “We’ve had Chinese citizens at Harvard, who are clearly doing the bidding of the Chinese state, coming and sitting in on talks and taking notes and reporting back,” Perry says. She similarly suspects Chinese citizens of reporting on visiting Chinese scholars’ activities.
Yet Harvard’s academic walls endure: China Studies at Harvard were born in a struggle over academic freedom, when John K. Fairbank persisted despite Senator Senator Joe McCarthy accusing him of “losing China” to communism. Today, the University provides a platform for scholarship and perspectives the CCP condemns, from exiled dissidents to courses on Tiananmen. Simultaneously, Harvard maintains deep interpersonal and institutional relationships to Chinese academics, companies, universities, and the highest level of government.
“I think it’s status. Harvard has a special, extremely special status in China,” Kleinman says, suggesting a possible theory for how the University maintains its balancing act. “I think that’s the long history of China’s involvement with Harvard,” he adds — a historic relationship distinct from that of the U.S. and Chinese governments.
“When you go to China, you would think there’s only one great university in the world,” Kleinman adds — an inflated status that, in his experience, Harvard doesn’t enjoy in other Asian countries.
Regardless of just how unique Harvard’s “status” is in China — other schools, such as Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, enjoy similar connections — Chinese leadership and universities certainly have a vested interest in maintaining the Harvard-China relationship.
“There’s enormous curiosity among the Chinese leadership on this,” Kirby says — they want to learn how Harvard works. He adds, “There’s an enormous amount of respect for Harvard, in part because of the outstanding Chinese students who have come here over the course of the past 100 or more years.”
And there is also a deep commitment, on Harvard’s side, to providing a platform for clashing perspectives — what Elliott dubs as a “foreign policy” built around dialogue and “Veritas.”
“The largest benefit of having the University president go to China, and in every case speak at a major Chinese University in a public setting in a speech that is made public, and then to have similar private conversations, is to continue to give our views, in the most public of settings, on the core values of the University,” Kirby says.
History, status, academic excellence, “Veritas” — these are reasons Harvard and China are uniquely useful to one another. It may also be that the mechanism of the Harvard-China relationship, bottom up connections between mutually interested faculty, insulates the University from the more devastating effects of China’s long arm.
“I never received any pushback of any sort from the University on programming that might be considered sensitive in China,” says Daniel Murphy, the Fairbank Center’s Executive Director. “Not only that, but even in some alternate universe where they wanted to push back, they don’t even have a good way to do it.” Programming occurs at such a grassroots level — through colleagues and personal networks — that it would be almost impossible for the University to intervene, he explains.
Yet on March 10, 2015, only a few hours before his flight’s departure, Teng Biao had to pause his travel preparations and make his way to Alford’s office. He entered Harvard’s physical walls, only to be brought further into the reach of China’s long arm. What caused the University’s foreign policy stance, at least momentarily, to bend?
Absent further comment from Alford, it’s difficult to know. Perhaps Alford or another Harvard administrator had direct contact with, or was contacted by, PRC leadership; perhaps a Harvard administrator decided on their own to preemptively censor the event. A meeting between the presidents of Harvard and the PRC may have provided unique potential for conflict; Teng Biao and Chen Guangcheng may be uniquely controversial figures. It is likely that Alford and Teng’s relationship meant the shield of decentralization Murphy described did not apply.
What is clear is that even if Teng Biao was the victim of a one-time exception at Harvard, the cancellation is not exceptional but rather a flashpoint in the evolving relationship between Chinese and American universities, between the Chinese and American governments. There may be a history of Harvard-China collaboration, as well as a history of universities acting as safety valves during tense geopolitical moments — but the nexus of racialist U.S. rhetoric, rising authoritarianism under President Xi, and shifting global power dynamics between the world’s two superpowers has no historical precedent. Harvard’s prestige may have once served as a backstop for the long arm, but the defense now seems partial at best. And if one such incident occurred at the University, it opens the possibility for more.
“The censorship, the self-censorship, is everywhere,” Teng says.

The decision to send students home to resume academics online has drastically impacted Harvard students, families, and faculty, but its consequences are not contained by the gates of Harvard Yard. The farms that provide food for the dining halls at Harvard and other colleges across the country face a unique crisis: The large orders they were expecting colleges to make have dissipated.
While a few kitchens remain open to provide for the roughly 450 students still living on campus, the volume of food the dining halls require has drastically decreased.
But if that decrease grants Harvard a financial reprieve that Harvard, it has caused serious financial insecurity for others, especially the local vendors that supply Harvard University Dining Services.
“I’ve laid off almost my entire company,” says Jared Auerbach, the CEO and founder of Red’s Best, a local fish distributor that sells to Harvard.
“Institutional food service is a big part of our business,” Auerbach says. He explains that his company immediately felt the financial constraints of the coronavirus pandemic as a result of Harvard’s and all other universities’ orders having “disappeared.”
“Almost everyone has been furloughed, and fishermen are tied up,” he says.
Asked about the possibility of students not returning to campus in the fall, Auerbach says “it would be devastating for us.”
Other Harvard suppliers, like Jim A. Ward of Ward’s Berry Farm, have found ways to remedy the loss of Harvard’s orders. The 175 acre family farm in Sharon, Mass. typically provides Harvard with an assortment of fruits and vegetables throughout the year.
“The orders have basically stopped altogether,” Ward says. As he drives a tractor across his farm, he explains that despite the substantial loss of orders, the farm has been able to stay profitable.
Ward says that his retail store, a farm-to-table grocery store, “is doing a lot” to financially support his business. The success of the store has even led to a shortage in produce. “We have actually hired a few more people to handle what we are doing in our retail store,” he says.
“If the timing of this pandemic had been a little different and hit during mid or late summer, it would be much more traumatic for my bottom line,” Ward says. If the country-wide shutdown continues into May and June, the high selling season for the farm, Ward expects to rely even more heavily on his retail store.
Rory O’Dwyer says that a similar situation is unfolding on the 80-acre Langwater Farm located in North Easton, Mass. that provides Harvard with vegetables.
O’Dwyer says the loss of all wholesale customers has become a “disconcerting” situation for her business, and in response, Langwater has “pivoted to selling more retail on the farm.”
One reason O’Dwyer’s store has been successful is the “short chain of people that touch the food,” which makes it an attractive alternative to the supermarket for concerned grocery shoppers.
The farm has accrued a surplus of “storage crops,” such as carrots and radishes that can be refrigerated and stored for a few weeks until the retail store needs to be replenished, O’Dwyer explains.
At the beginning of the shutdown, her staff had no choice but to throw away some perishables, but they have since been able to sell most of them at their store. If the shutdown continues into the summer, when most of Langwater’s perishable items come into season, the farm has a contingency plan.
“We have a relationship with an organization called the Boston Area Gleaners,” O’Dwyer explains. If the farm is not able to sell the perishables in the summer, they will invite the non-profit to harvest any left over crops and donate them to local food banks and charities.
Don Thibodeau, the president of Green Thumb Farms in Fryeburg, Maine has serious concerns about the surplus of potatoes that his farm has begun to accrue over the past few weeks. Although he sells much of his product to chain grocery stores, Thibodeau explains that “the french fry market, either fresh or frozen, has come to a standstill,” which has had a serious impact on his business.
Thibodeau is comforted by the storage life of his potatoes and hopes that once businesses begin to open back up, his surplus will diminish, and he will be able to return to business as usual.
As the nation-wide shutdown continues, however, there is no definitive timeline for when business will return to normal — a serious worry for many local food vendors that have been particularly hurt by Harvard’s shift to remote learning.
These business owners must wait to hear from governors, mayors, and university presidents before deciding the safest time to reopen their operations.
As Auerbach puts it, “I’d believe anything. If you told me colleges would be back in September, I’d believe you, and if you told me they wouldn’t be back for three years, I’d believe you.”
For the time being, wholesales will more than likely continue to be halted, surpluses will increase, and contingency plans will be made to mitigate damage. Farmers will have no choice but to wait.

Searching for a newspaper on a Friday afternoon in February, I walked to the Out of Town News kiosk in the center of Harvard Square and discovered something I hadn’t expected. Instead of the magazines and cigarettes that used to line the brick walls, the T-entrance-sized box was now decorated with potted plants, a swing, wooden crates, and monochrome photographs on newly white-panelled walls.
About 15 people filled the space, and a woman who appeared to be some sort of receptionist was stationed at a booth near the door. There was not a single seat open. Some people leaned back with their eyelids shut; others spoke in low voices. A young couple cuddled. Teenagers scrolled on their phones. The books and board games displayed on the shelves were untouched. Everyone seemed to be…waiting.
This is a CultureHouse “third space,” a place “between home and work to hang out, meet people, create, share skills, and learn,” its website states. Started in 2017, CultureHouse aims to “increase livability and joy in cities,” by designing free-to-use, public infrastructure projects that leverage vacant urban spaces, founder Aaron B. Greiner explains. The Harvard Square location is one of two temporary CultureHouse pop-ups in Cambridge; the other is in Kendall Square.
Their online presence appears utopian, with clean, geometric graphics for their Instagram stories and images of single light bulbs hanging above CultureHouse-goers who sip tea while staring out of large windows. At their Kendall Square location, CultureHouse hosts Chinese tea workshops, book clubs, yoga sessions, and movie nights.
Through such programming, CultureHouse hopes to “provide gathering places that meet the needs and wants of communities,” Greiner says.
***
Around 100 to 200 guests come through the doors of the Harvard Square location each day. Bianca M. Cruz, a staff member, describes the 15 to 35 people who come everyday for most of the day as “regulars.” Many of these “regulars” are youth experiencing homelessness, Cruz explains, and they may have nowhere else to go, given that “many shelters close during the day or other public spaces have banned them.”
Some of those 100 to 200 visitors are more affluent Cambridge residents. “A lot of [them] abstractly and nebulously really love this. They’ll come, say it’s awesome, and then leave and never come back,” Cruz says. A couple days later, I recall Cruz’s characterization as I watch a vested man with a Coop shopping bag on his arm wander in with incredulity. He begins to read the plaques beneath the artwork, as if surveying a museum exhibit, and then leaves quickly. He has somewhere else to be.
Cruz’s role is mainly one of management: She switches between the Harvard Square and Kendall Square locations, ensuring that community guidelines, like no sleeping and no large bags in the space, are followed. While her formal capacity is one of enforcement, she has found that over time, the frequenters of the Harvard Square location have become closer acquaintances.
She knows names and faces, and often will have conversations with people using the space. “One of the first things they say is, ‘We love you guys. This is the only place that we’'re not being served by somebody, or we’'re not being harassed by police or security or employees trying to kick us out,’” she says.
I talk to some of the people who often use the Harvard Square location — all of whom were experiencing, or had experienced, homelessness — and many express some kind of appreciation for the structure. But there’s only so much respite that this temporary haven can provide.
“This place is nice,” says Singer, a man who has been singing in the Square as a living since 1979.
“I’m just keeping warm,” says Felix B. McKinsey, a teenager who has lived in Cambridge off-and-on for two years.
“Mostly a place to hang out when I’m on a break from work,” says Nick O’Brian, an employee at Pokeworks.
“You’re guaranteed to see somebody you know,” says Kelly Coveney says. As Coveney sits, she cross-stitches Santa and his reindeers on a cloth pattern. Although she now shares a home with her husband and three cats, she is still in touch with Cambridge’s homeless community, particularly its younger members. “I try to point them in the right direction,” Coveney says.
Many of the people I speak with tell me that the swing anchored to the ceiling is especially treasured. As for the art lining CultureHouse’s walls, O’Brian explains that “it adds colour,” but he has admittedly “never actually taken the time to look at it.”
None of them have attended a scheduled CultureHouse event.
When it comes to designing a space, Greiner follows the slogan “Nothing about us without us,” coined by the disability movement. “We shouldn’t be assuming that we know what communities need without asking them and co-designing with them,” he says.
I ask Greiner about how CultureHouse gathers user input.“Mostly we do a lot of observations ourselves,” he explains. “People communicate in different ways.” While people are somewhat unpredictable, over time, CultureHouse staff has experimented with the arrangement of furniture, finding that a chair here or a table there impacts how people occupy the space. The perceived improvement of the space based on these changes, however, comes from staff rather than residents.
At the time I speak with Greiner, CultureHouse is preparing to change again. An art project by Lesley University students is underway, part of a larger scale renovation of the Harvard Square location. The project is titled “Belong.”
***
I return to the Harvard Square location after the weekend and everything has changed. The wallpaper is red, a table with coloring supplies has been plopped in the middle of the space, and a shiny aluminium photo booth that looks like a spaceship has replaced the beloved swing.
“I’m kinda mad at them for that; I’m very protective of my swing,” McKinsey says.
Today is Joshua D. Bowen’s first day visiting. He is a student at Lesley, and he’s in charge of the lighting. After spending the semester studying urban design, his class was given the option to collectively revamp CultureHouse as their capstone project. Similar to how CultureHouse changes their design, the students created “a checklist of what [they] wanted to do” in the CultureHouse space without a previous survey of the community users. But, Bowen explains, their design is “constantly changing based on feedback and different themes.” Some of that feedback is from CultureHouse users.
Pasted on the door of the Harvard Square location is an attractive event schedule. This week, guests have PechaKucha-style social commons, a Chinese ideograms teach-in, and a sound-bathing workshop to look forward to. The first event of the week is a soup tasting.

With COVID19 shuttering non-essential businesses, CultureHouse’s physical spaces are closed for the foreseeable future, but this hasn’t stopped them connecting on their “virtual pop-up,” CultureCloud, featuring links to online museums, a COVID- inspired photo gallery and their own webinars on topics such as Promoting Your Work Online. Quoting sociologist Eric Klinenberg, Greiner feels confident that “building places where all kinds of people can gather is the best way to repair the fractured societies we live in today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will not “seek or accept” the nearly $9 million in funds allocated to it by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, according to a Wednesday statement from University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Facing criticism from multiple members of Congress and the President of the United States, the University originally announced on Monday that it would allocate the entire $8.6 million to student financial relief.
“We have previously said that Harvard, like other institutions, will face significant financial challenges due to the pandemic and economic crisis it has caused,” Swain wrote. “We are also concerned however, that the intense focus by politicians and others on Harvard in connection with this program may undermine participation in a relief effort that Congress created and the President signed into law for the purpose of helping students and institutions whose financial challenges in the coming months may be most severe.”
“As a result of this, and the evolving guidance being issued around use of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Harvard has decided not to seek or accept the funds allocated to it by statute,” he added.
Stanford University and Princeton University both announced they would not accept CARES funding earlier Wednesday.
Swain wrote that the University hopes that the funding will be allocated to struggling universities in Massachusetts.
“While we understand any reallocation of these resources is a matter for the Department of Education, we hope that special consideration will be given to Massachusetts institutions that are struggling to serve their communities and meet the needs of their students through these difficult and challenging times,” Swain wrote.
He added that Harvard remains “fully committed” to providing students with financial support.

In the wake of campus's closure due to COVID-19, Harvard undergraduates have developed a personalized video call platform which aims to mirror the experience of the College's in-person admitted students’ weekend, virtually connecting the incoming Class of 2024 with each other and with current Harvard affiliates.
The platform, Admeeted, groups users into a series of small, intimate video calls based on factors such as hometowns, interests, and intended majors. Every 15 to 30 minutes, the platform randomly shuffles the groups so each user can meet new people.
“Imagine you’re at a party. You’re not going to want to talk to all 300 people at once. You’d much rather talk to small groups of people,” said Albert W. Zhang, the platform’s creator and a future member of the Class of 2024.
“Now imagine the people you talk to share your interests, hobbies, and hometown,” he added. “Every conversation is better for leading to lasting friendships. That experience you get on Admeeted and nowhere else.”
Several students who say they intend to enroll at Harvard as members of the Class of 2024 said they have enjoyed using the platform to meet their peers.
“I’ve met a lot of people who I’m close to now, and I’m really excited to go to school with them next year. I have my own group chats with these people, and we all do our own Zoom calls,” Alexandria R. King said.
Boluwaji E. Odufuwa said that while Admeeted cannot perfectly capture the in-person Visitas experience, it is “the best we can do” under the circumstances.
“Everybody is pretty bummed out that Visitas has been cancelled,” Odufuwa said. “But then at the same time, we’re really excited that Albert is providing this service for all the prefrosh.”
Currently, Admeeted boasts more than 6,000 users from 20 institutions and organizations, including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, according to Bill W. Zhang ’21.
Several Harvard student organizations — such as the Undergraduate Council, Harvard College Consulting Group, and Harvard Student Agencies — have joined the platform and will host informational events for prospective students, according to Zhang.
Christina Yee ’21, HSA’s Chief Marketing Officer, wrote in an email that HSA plans to hold its first event on Admeeted this Friday.
“We are excited that [Admeeted] has given us another avenue to be able to meet the Class of 2024!” Yee wrote.
The UC plans to host a “Meet the UC” event on the platform this Friday, according to Mini Ganesh ’22, secretary of the Council’s Finance Committee.
“Pre-frosh seemed really engaged on the platform from what I can tell, and I thought it would be a cool way to meet them,” Ganesh said.
Zhang wrote in a text message that his brother, Bill Zhang, has been a “tremendous help” in developing Admeeted. Bill Zhang, who studies Applied Math and Computer Science at the College, said he has worked most closely on the technology and website development aspects of the platform.
“I believe the world is sort of like a rubber band, and it’s been stretched by COVID-19 to such an extent that even when it’s gone, the rubber band will never go back into place and then social interaction won’t be the same anymore,” Bill Zhang said. “In a fundamentally different world, I believe Admeeted has a place to connect all types of people.”
Admeeted’s website offers users the opportunity to join multiple organizations and has regularly added new features since it launched. Bill Zhang said he hopes to “take the best” from different social networks in order to form a platform that allows for real-time video chatting and other networking features.
The Zhang brothers contend on a fact sheet about Admeeted that the platform has grown “much more rapidly” than Facebook, Twitter, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams at launch. They said they have received attention from investors.
“Less than two weeks after the launch, we were reached out to by a seasoned venture capital firm that is interested in investing in us,” Albert said.
The brothers said they hope to expand the platform beyond admitted students’ weekends to accommodate other individuals and organizations.
“Our goal is to become the next Facebook, which is pretty interesting considering we’re starting from Harvard just like Mark [Zuckerberg] did,” Albert Zhang wrote in an email.

The College will administer this semester’s course evaluations in a “different form” to reflect the disruptions wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh and Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser announced in an email to faculty Wednesday.
Specifically, the Q survey — which the College administers to students to collect course and instructor feedback each semester — will collect “primarily qualitative” data, and the results will not be made accessible to students. Typically, students rate various aspects of their courses, and their quantitative overall scores are published on an online course catalog alongside select qualitative comments.
“Given the unprecedented disruption this term, we also know that it makes little sense to pursue our normal approach to collecting, sharing, and otherwise using data from the Q survey,” Claybaugh and Zipser wrote in their email. “Just as grading will be done on an emergency basis this semester, the Q survey will also temporarily take a different form.”
Last month, the University moved all courses online and required students to leave campus due to the coronavirus. After the mass dispersal, many students promptly agitated for the College to retool its grading schema to accommodate those in difficult circumstances due to the pandemic.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay eventually announced at the end of March that all undergraduates would be graded on an emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory basis after the Faculty Council unanimously voted in favor of such a system.
According to the Q guide website, questions this spring will ask students to evaluate the on-campus portion of the course as well as their ability to participate in and learn from the course in its remote format. The College will omit questions asking students to rate the course overall and indicate whether they would recommend it to peers, and faculty can add up to five additional, customized questions.
The deans said this feedback would be used to develop “best practices in remote teaching.”
“This semester’s Q will give us an opportunity to document our collective work and to learn from our experiences,” Claybaugh and Zipser wrote.

Following in the footsteps of a successful petition campaign by Harvard Forward, Yale Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change and alumni representation within the school’s governance boards — launched a campaign to elect 2015 alum Maggie Thomas to the Yale Corporation Wednesday.
In an email to supporters, Harvard Forward wrote that Wednesday — the 50th anniversary of Earth Day — was an apt time to “remind ourselves that our efforts at Harvard are part of a much larger global effort."
“That's why we're very excited to announce that our own movement is also growing,” Harvard Forward wrote. “Today, our friends in New Haven launch their own petition campaign for the Yale Corporation on a platform of climate action, endowment justice, and inclusive governance.”
“Together, we can make sure both Harvard and Yale alumni can vote for climate champions in their next elections,” they added.
In February, Harvard Forward successfully petitioned to get on the ballot for Harvard’s Board of Overseers election. All five of the candidates received 4,500 alumni signatures, according to a Harvard Forward press release.
The genesis of Yale Forward, Harvard Forward’s “sister campaign,” comes after student activists staged a notable joint protest at the 136th edition of the Harvard-Yale football game in November. At The Game, dozens of students calling for fossil fuel divestment ran onto the field at halftime, with several hundred spectators joining them as they staged a sit-in.
The demonstration ended with some protestors facing arrest and charges of disorderly conduct. A Connecticut Judge dismissed all of their charges in January.
Spokespeople from Harvard and Yale did not respond to requests for comment.
The Yale Forward campaign is centered on electing Thomas to the university’s corporation, which is Yale’s principal governing body.
The corporation — which is also known as the Board of Trustees — is made up of Yale’s president and 16 trustees; 10 of the members are appointed successor trustees who are limited to two six-year terms, and six members are elected alumni fellows, according to Yale’s website. The elected fellows are “chosen by alumni for staggered six-year terms,” and the governor and lieutenant governor of Connecticut are also ex officio board members.
Thomas — a 2015 graduate of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies — wrote in a press release that she believes Yale University has the “potential to be a champion of light and truth” in fighting climate change.
“I want to work towards that future together,” Thomas wrote.
Similar to Harvard Forward, Yale Forward has a three-pronged platform focued on climate action, endowment justice, and more inclusive governance.
“Policy proposals include fossil fuel divestment, more robust processes for developing socially-responsible investment guidelines, and increased support for climate-focused research and education,” the press release reads. “The platform also calls for the elimination of the five-year disenfranchisement rule for Yale College alumni—who are barred from voting in Corporation elections until they have held their degrees for more than five years—and for increased transparency around the operations of the Corporation.”
Thomas specifically cited a policy that mandates the Yale Corporation’s meeting minutes remain sealed for 50 years.
“I think we can all agree that this degree of opacity does not serve the interests of the Yale community,” she wrote.
Since William Horowitz was elected as the University’s first Jewish Trustee in 1965, no other petition candidate has been successfully elected to the Yale Corporation, according to the press release.
"I'm running for the Yale Corporation because I believe that Yale University can have a positive impact on the future of the planet,” Thomas wrote. “And I’m fighting for younger Yale graduates who should be able to participate in the election of Alumni Fellows to the Corporation.”

The Kendall Square-based biotechnology firm Biogen announced on April 16 it will partner with the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and Boston-area hospitals to build a COVID-19 biobank — a repository that will store biological samples to be used for research purposes.
The announcement comes roughly a month after Biogen held a leadership conference in early March that has been linked to 99 cases of the virus in the Commonwealth.
Biogen will collect anonymized blood samples from Biogen employees who have recovered from COVID-19 and volunteer to participate in the study. They will also attempt to collect samples from close contacts of those employees, whether or not they tested positive or displayed symptoms of the virus.
The samples will provide medical data for researchers to use as they investigate the biology of the pathogen and attempt to find a vaccine, per Biogen’s press release announcing the establishment of the biobank.
Partners Healthcare, which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, will help the Broad Institute and Biogen collect data from the blood samples.
The combined opportunity to work with patients who have contracted COVID-19 and with the expansive research network will allow for multifaceted research into the disease, according to Deborah T. Hung ’88, the co-director of the Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program at the Broad Institute.
“The ability to collaborate directly with a cohort of local patients who were among the first in Massachusetts to contract COVID-19, and partner with leading health care and biomedical and research institutions across Kendall Square and the Boston area, allows us to launch many critical research approaches at once,” Hung wrote in the press release.
The Broad Institute will aggregate and anonymize the data from Biogen affiliates and their close contacts to study the range of symptoms that people with the virus display, as well as their antibody levels.
Hung wrote the biobank will help researchers understand the mechanism by which the virus spreads through large populations and how patients generate antibodies after contracting the pathogen.
“We’ll gain insights into the biology of how the disease moved through a relatively small group of the larger population, early in the local life-cycle in Massachusetts,” Hung wrote. “Just as important, we’ll be able to evaluate the levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.”
Hospitals in the Boston area have already begun clinical trials to help treat coronavirus patients. Ravi Thadhani, Chief Academic Officer at Partners HeathCare, wrote in press release that the biobank will improve research and represents a “significant advancement” for the scientific community.
Biogen Chief Medical Officer Maha Radhakrishnan wrote that because of the number of Biogen affiliates who have contracted the virus, the company can provide important data to the repository.
“We are uniquely positioned to contribute to advancing COVID-19 science in an organized and deliberate way so we can all gain a better understanding of this virus,” Radhakrishnan wrote. “Many Biogen colleagues have been eager to find ways to help others during this pandemic, and it is our hope that this biobank will provide hope and essential information during this difficult time.”

Like much of the College’s programming, freshman pre-orientation programs aimed at helping incoming members of the Class of 2024 adjust to college life will not occur as normal due to the unpredictable patterns of the coronavirus.
The College’s usual pre-orientation offerings range from the First-Year Outdoor Program — where students backpack, canoe, or perform trail work service in the wilderness of New England— to the First-Year Urban Program, where students work in Boston and Cambridge to advance diversity, equity, and social justice.
Harvard also offers the First-Year Arts Program, the First-Year Retreat Experience, the First-Year International Program, and the new Leadership Institute for the First-Year Experience. The Dean of Students Office oversees all pre-orientation programs.
The FOP Steering Committee wrote in an email Wednesday to its trip leaders that the DSO has informed them the FOP trips will not take place in their normal form. They also wrote that the College is working on alternative programming, and that they plan to implement a “new vision” of the program.
“Yesterday we received word from the DSO that due to a more than likely altered fall semester, pre-orientation programs will not be proceeding per usual in August,” they wrote. “We're so sorry to all of you who have worked, trained, and prepared for our in-person August trips.”
“Expect to hear from us after the College makes a final call, but know that we haven't thrown in the towel yet,” they added.
FOP trip leader Matthew Z. Li ’22 said that while the program’s uncertain fate is a “bummer,” he ultimately understands the College’s calculus.
“You can’t run a pre-o if you can’t guarantee safety, or at least minimal risk, to your participants,” Li said. “While the cancellation is not set in stone, right now we’re acting as though we’re not going to lead trips in the fall.”
Students involved with FAP also received similar emails notifying them that pre-orientation programming will be altered.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that pre-orientation programs will not be cancelled, but instead will be modified.
“The College is currently working with Pre-Orientation programs and their student leaders to determine how we will deliver our Pre-Orientation programs safely and within the guidance we are receiving from the University, state, and local health officials,” she wrote. “We know these programs are meaningful experiences for our incoming students, and we are thoughtfully considering how to maintain them."
Dane also noted that decisions about pre-orientation programs are independent of future University actions regarding the fall semester at large.

William V. Giannobile, a renowned scholar in oral regenerative medicine, will serve as the School of Dental Medicine’s next dean following a national search, according to a University press release.
Giannobile, a School of Dental Medicine alum, will take over from interim dean Vicki Rosen on Sept. 1. Rosen stepped in for R. Bruce Donoff, who stepped down at the end of 2019 after 28 years at the helm.
“I am thrilled to welcome Will back to the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and the Longwood Medical Area,” Daley said in the announcement. “Having roots in our community and experience as a passionate and productive leader of a major department at a premier dental school make him perfectly suited to take the helm at HSDM during this unprecedented time.”
“Our medical and dental schools are inextricably linked, and I look forward to Will’s partnership toward our shared mission of improving health for all through education, research and service,” Daley added.
The current chair of the Department of Periodontics and Oral Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, Giannobile is also a professor of biomedical engineering at the university’s College of Engineering.
After graduating from the Dental School, Giannobile completed his postdoctoral training in molecular biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospital, before serving as a faculty member at the Dental School.
“We are so pleased to welcome Will Giannobile, a leader who will help to ensure the School’s continued success as we seek more opportunities to support and expand the work of the University’s diversely talented biomedical community,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release.
Giannobile has an extensive background in scholarly work about regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and personalized medicine. His research and teaching have received national recognition from the Academy of Periodontology and the American Dental Association, according to the release.
“Will Giannobile, with his wide-ranging accomplishments as a scholar, leader, teacher and practitioner, is uniquely suited to head a school whose approach to dental health draws heavily on medicine, bioengineering and public health,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in the release.
Giannobile will oversee the School of Dental Medicine at a time when the school will enroll its “most diverse predoctoral class in recent history,” according to the press release.
“The tradition of excellence of the School as a leader in global education, research, clinical care and societal impact creates exciting new avenues of interactions with our diverse array of students, staff, faculty, alumni and friends,” Giannobile said in the release. “The Longwood Medical Area and fruitful partnerships with the medical school and affiliates creates opportunities for collaboration to promote science, innovation and education.”

The Office of Sexual Prevention and Response cancelled several events previously planned for Sexual Assault Awareness Month, shifted counseling online, and developed new resources in order to adapt to the current situation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
OSAPR Director Pierre R. Berastain ’10 said in an interview Tuesday that as soon as the University informed students they had to leave campus for the remainder of the semester, OSAPR began thinking about how it would have to change the services it usually provides, which typically range from large events to individual counseling sessions.
April is usually one of the busiest months for OSAPR because of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, according to Berastain. But this year, he said, much of its scheduled programming had to be cancelled because many events, even if they were held online, would lose their “in-person touch."
Instead, Berastain said OSAPR began to develop resources and programming adapted to specific needs students might have while away from school, such as providing information on technological safety and ways to avoid cyberstalking and privacy violations.
“We said, how do we provide resources for students to increase their capacity and knowledge about ensuring tech safety?” Berastain said. “So we poured some resources into figuring out some resources that are available, and we created a page on tech safety.”
Roseangelle D. Poyau, a case coordinator at OSAPR, added OSAPR has faced some difficulties transitioning counseling services to an online format, but said the office is adjusting to fit the needs of students.
“People can't just come and meet with us in person and so right now we’re doing phone appointments and we’re doing Zoom appointments,” Poyau said. “We're not necessarily operating on our regular nine-to-five that we typically do. We're being very flexible with the schedule and making appointments as works for people.”
Berastain said OSAPR is “fine-tuning” its information on resources available to students who reside outside of Massachusetts — such as processes for obtaining a restraining order — which change regularly.
“In terms of different policies, that actually ends up changing on a weekly basis,” he said. “One court might be open today and next week, it’s not. So it really is just being on top of it.”
Berastain added that though OSAPR is staying informed of such changes around the world, it is maintaining an “individual-centered approach” in working with students.
“The philosophy that we go by at OSAPR is individual-centered,” Berastain said. “So if somebody calls us from out of state or from Massachusetts or from outside of the country, we're going to figure out, ‘what are those individuals' needs, and how do we best meet them based on the resources available?’”
OSAPR is also hosting several weekly virtual events including “Netflix & Chill” sessions to watch a movie and have conversations about consent and relationships in media, yoga classes, and “Lunch & Learns” to discuss various issues including consent and how to manage long-distance relationships.
“That reality is going to look different depending on what decisions are made,” Berastain said. We’re all waiting to hear what's going to happen, and we’ll adapt accordingly. But we haven't heard something concrete yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Harvard schools have cancelled or adapted their regular summer programming due to the uncertainties and risks presented by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
On April 13, Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana announced the College’s 2020 summer programming will be held entirely online. A number of pre-approved courses, however, can be taken online for credit. Offices and College-sponsored programs that provide summer funding for students have also amended their funding rules.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, Harvard School of Public Health, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, and Harvard Graduate School for Education have also either cancelled or moved their regular summer programming online.
GSAS will conduct its summer outreach programs remotely, according to spokesperson Ann Hall. The school also cancelled its annual professional communication program for international students planned for August.
The Business School has cancelled the in-person version of its Summer Venture in Management Program and Peak Weekend for college-age prospective students. According to a statement posted to the school’s admissions blog, the programs are designed to help students learn more about the Business School, and the decision to cancel was not “made lightly.”
“Our faculty, staff, and students love hosting SVMP and Peek and enjoy meeting the prospective students through the programs," the announcement reads. “We know that this is disappointing news for many, and we are sad too.”
Instead of their usual in-person events, the programs will host virtual programming for participants in mid-June. There is no cost to participate.
The Law School, meanwhile, will not run its annual executive education program, a summer initiative focused on leadership development for lawyers and legal organizations, per Law School Spokesperson Jeff A. Neal.
At the School of Public Health, Dean for Academic Affairs Jane J. Kim, Executive Dean for Administration Katherine A. Hope, and Dean for Education Erin Driver-Linn announced in an email that summer educational programming will be delivered remotely.
“We still have many details to figure out about how we will transition our summer programs online,” they wrote. “The intensive efforts to transition to remote learning this spring underscored that the experience of learning remotely is not the same as in-person.”
The email noted, however, that the decision to cancel summer programming should not be taken to reflect any plans for the School of Public Health’s fall semester.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies cancelled its summer fellowship program and moved to virtual programming “for the foreseeable future,” according to Radcliffe spokesperson Jane F. Huber.
The nearby Graduate School of Education, though, is still assessing how to deliver their summer programing, according to spokesperson Bari E. Walsh, who wrote in an emailed statement that planning is unfolding on a “case-by-case basis.”
“Across the school, we are consistently and carefully evaluating the best way to deliver our programming, with student, faculty, and staff safety as our primary consideration at this time,” Walsh wrote in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College will aim to conclude its five ongoing faculty dean searches by the end of May as planned, according to Dean of Finance and Administration Sheila C. Thimba.
In an unprecedented moment of turnover, nearly half of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate houses — Kirkland, Cabot, Eliot, Quincy, and Winthrop — are seeking new leadership for the coming fall semester.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who is also one of the outgoing faculty deans of Cabot House, said in a Friday interview that the College hopes to maintain momentum and community investment in the search processes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. During a normal semester, faculty dean candidates would eat meals and chat with students in the houses they are courting.
“Our goal is to sustain that level of engagement from the house staff through remote processes, and we were pretty far along in the search processes,” Khurana said. “So while this is not ideal, we feel we're able to continue in a positive way to announce our new faculty deans at the end of the semester.”
The College’s House Search Advisory Committees are currently preparing to invite prospective faculty deans to virtually “visit” houses. The committees comprise the staff, tutors, and students of each house who had already been working with the College on campus to offer insight into their selection criteria for faculty deans.
Thimba wrote that the College completed “much of the heavy lifting” in the search process before it asked students to vacate campus on March 10. By the time students left, the committees had already hosted open meetings with students to collect ideas and feedback.
Once classes transitioned online, administrators paused the searches to allow house affiliates the time to settle into new routines. Harvard reconvened the committees last week to review candidate materials and discuss future steps.
“Now, SAC’s are planning the visits, so they can take account of House rhythms and engage students in ways that are most appropriate to the culture of each House,” Thimba wrote. “We’re providing administrative support to the committees to lessen their burden.”
Thimba added that levels of participation from undergraduates on the committees have remained “strong” despite students’ dispersal.
Still, some students in Winthrop House have voiced concerns that a remote transition in leadership will create additional disruption in their already-upended lives.
Winthrop affiliates already experienced leadership turnover last spring, when the College decided not to renew the contract of former faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson amid a controversy over Sullivan’s decision to represent Hollywood producer and convicted sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.
Since then, Winthrop students have petitioned and penned a letter to the administration asking them to keep their interim faculty deans, Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan, in their positions permanently.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed that the Winthrop house faculty dean search was ongoing. The College has previously noted that Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan were appointed to serve in a temporary capacity.
Thimba wrote that the administration is working to preserve continuity for all students, given the circumstances.
“Across the College, there is a lot of thought going into how to ensure that the essential aspects of the College experience, including House life, are sustained through this disrupted period,” Thimba wrote.
She added that she expects a significant amount of necessary “orientation” over the summer for the ten incoming deans.
“We’re looking forward to working with current faculty deans to ensure that the new deans are acclimated to the role quickly and are eager to work with incoming deans and their unique approaches [to] the particular task of community building after the disruptions this semester,” she wrote.

Losses to the University’s endowment due to the coronavirus pandemic may have a disproportionate impact on the Harvard schools which draw the highest proportions of their budget from the endowment: the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and the Harvard Divinity School.
Though the endowment was last valued at $40.9 billion in June 2019, top administrators wrote in an email to affiliates last week that it is “not as large as it was previously.”
“As it shrinks, it has less capacity to support our existing operations, especially as other shortfalls in revenue sources loom,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in their email.
In fiscal year 2019, the Radcliffe Institute drew the highest proportion of its budget from the endowment of all Harvard's schools at 87 percent.
In an email to staff on Friday, Radcliffe Institute Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin recognized the Institute’s “unique” financial realities with regard to the endowment.
“We are uniquely dependent on the endowment and must plan for the likelihood of flat or reduced endowment income over the next several years,” she wrote.

Other sources of funds for the Institute may also see reduced revenues, per Brown-Nagin. The Radcliffe Institute owns and operates an apartment building at 83 Brattle Street which rents to fellows, faculty, visiting scholars, and staff across the University. Monthly rent for the 31 apartments ranges from $2,121 to $3,473 per month.

“We are also confronted with high vacancy in 83 Brattle and the loss of external rental income, and we anticipate reduced philanthropic support,” she wrote.

Gifts for current use comprise 11 percent of the Institute’s budget. Experts have predicted a decline in donations as the economy reels from the impact of coronavirus.

Brown-Nagin wrote that she felt “heartened” by spending reductions in the short term, though she referenced the potential for “painful” choices in the future.

“In the near term, I am heartened to note that our collective efforts to reduce spending and shift to remote delivery of mission-critical activities is helping to offset these losses of revenue,” Brown-Nagin wrote.

Jane F. Huber, a spokesperson for the Institute, wrote in an emailed statement that it is “not in a position at this time” to talk about the specific financial impact of the pandemic.

“We do not want to get ahead of the careful assessments being undertaken at the university level and by our own Finance team,” Huber wrote.
Harvard Divinity School drew the second-largest proportion of its budget from the endowment last fiscal year, at 74 percent.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton wrote in an email to affiliates last Monday that the school may face challenges due to its dependence on the endowment.
“HDS is not insulated and inevitably difficult choices lie ahead,” Hempton wrote. “We rely on the endowment for over 60 percent of our revenue, and in the current economic environment its returns and usage will be constrained.”
Michael P. Naughton, a spokesperson for the Divinity School, declined to comment further on the school's finances.
After the Great Recession in 2008, the total value of the endowment declined almost 30 percent — equal to $11 billion of the then-$37 billion endowment. As a result, the Radcliffe Institute reduced its expenditures by lowering the number of fellows, limiting acquisitions of the Schlesinger Library, and postponing renovations of an administrative building. The Divinity School, meanwhile, cut its budget by postponing new initiatives, taking a hiatus on some programs, and reducing appointments for visiting and adjunct professors.
Hempton told affiliates in his email that the school is in a “stronger position now” than it was at the time of the last financial crisis.
“Harvard Divinity School has managed its finances with exceptional prudence for more than a decade,” Hempton wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A report released Monday by Harvard’s Safra Center for Ethics estimates that the United States will need the capacity to test up to 20 million people per day for the novel coronavirus in order to fully reopen its economy.
The center’s “Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience” — written by a group of economics, public health, technology, and ethics experts — details a plan to open up the U.S. economy in phases. The plan aims to fully reopen the economy by August, though it notes specific timelines may vary by region.
The report advocates for a testing, tracing and supported isolation approach to the virus, rather than extended social distancing. The main steps of that approach entail dramatically ramping up coronavirus testing, tracing the contacts of those who test positive so they can also be tested, and isolating confirmed cases. All the while, the report urges aggressive vaccine development.
The U.S. tested roughly 311,000 people for the virus Wednesday — the most tests it had conducted in a single day. Testing rates have typically hovered at around 150,000 per day since late March, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
Researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute released a separate report Saturday estimating that the country needs to perform between 500,000 to 700,000 tests per day to reopen the economy.
The Safra Center, meanwhile, estimates the U.S. needs the capacity to test between 2 and 6 percent of the population — or between five and 20 million people — each day to fully reopen.
“We do not propose a modest level of TTSI intended to supplement collective quarantine as a tool of disease control,” the report reads. “Rather we recommend a level of TTSI ambitious enough to replace collective quarantine as a tool of disease control. TTSI should replace stay-at-home.”
Many public health experts are currently arguing that the U.S. should continue with social distancing until a vaccine is developed. Some Harvard researchers have said that social distancing measures may be necessary until 2022.
The Safra Center’s report argues that by instead using a TTSI program, the U.S. could avoid intermittent cycles of opening up and shutting down that a social distancing approach may cause.
“It allows us to steadily reopen the parts of the economy that have been shut down, protect our frontline workers, and contain the virus to levels where it can be effectively managed and treated until we can find a vaccine,” the report reads.
The report argues that though there will be financial and logistical difficulties in implementing such a plan, social distancing would ultimately be far costlier.
“Creating the complex supply and delivery chains required for testing at this scale will require a rapid coordination of business activity unprecedented since World War II,” the report reads. “But the cost of such a testing and tracing, or TTSI, program—$50 to 300 billion over two years—is dwarfed by the economic cost of continued collective quarantine of $100 to 350 billion a month.”
Government professor Danielle S. Allen, who directs the Safra Center and was the lead author on the report, wrote in an emailed statement that implementing large-scale TTSI programs will be “mission critical” to allowing schools to open on time this fall.
“All organizations and businesses would need to plan for changes to operations to accommodate and institutionalize what’s necessary to operate in a context where a disease of this kind is still circulating,” Allen wrote. “For all arriving students, including international students, it would presumably be necessary to establish protocols for quarantine and/or testing upon arrival.”
The report acknowledges that the plan is unlikely to succeed without the coordination of industry, academia, and government.
Allen wrote that the Safra Center has been in contact with numerous government officials regarding its recommendations.
“We have been communicating regularly with staff for the White House Task Force, staff for the National Governors Association Task Force, a national network of mayors, members of Congress in both parties, and staff at the CDC,” she wrote. “As a first step, we would really like to see the CDC adjust its guidance so that guidance supports both therapeutic testing for symptomatic individuals and also disease control testing, including of asymptomatic individuals. Currently the guidance supports only the former.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First-year Harvard Law School students Noopur Sen, Adam J. Toobin, and Adira E. Levine won first place on Sunday in the Negotiations Challenge 2020, a global competition where teams aim to reach a consensus on a corporate or governmental issue with other parties.
The competition was originally scheduled to take place in Barcelona from April 16 to 18, but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, organizers moved the event online, and the five rounds of the competition took place over the span of multiple weeks.
The competitors joined their negotiation rounds via Zoom, competing from different time zones — sometimes until as late as 3 a.m. — and cooperating with students from around the globe.
Levine, who Zoomed into the competition from Chicago, said the virtual platform made reaching a compromise particularly difficult.
“So much of what you rely on in terms of signaling from other parties in the room is obfuscated a bit and your ability to build rapport is changed, if not diminished, by the screen,” Levine said. “But I think it's a good practice to become comfortable with. And certainly for the three of us on this call, I think that it really enhanced our need, and ability, to trust and rely on each other.”
According to Sen, the fact that the competitors were coming from different time zones exacerbated the challenge.
“In our first round, we had five time zones,” Sen said. “We had one person in Japan, one person in India, one person in Pakistan, two people on the East Coast, and one person Chicago time, and it was a negotiation to even figure out what time we could all speak.”
During the competition, teams of three were assigned hypothetical leadership roles in international corporations or city councils, and asked to negotiate a deal to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. The competitors were evaluated on several different criteria, including the result of their negotiations and their communication skills.
Though the three law school students had taken the same negotiations workshop this winter, they had never worked together on a negotiation before. But they said they knew that they wanted to be a team as soon as they heard about the competition.
“We were all in the same class and we observed each other in our negotiations,” Toobin said. “And so when Noopur connected with the Negotiations Challenge, we were just sort of a natural trio to enter.”
Despite the extra challenge that the coronavirus pandemic brought to the competition, Toobin said he appreciated that he still had the opportunity to compete alongside his friends.
“Being able to stay together with some of your closest friends and do this academic thing that we worked really hard on over winter term, and to see it be rewarded is, you know, it's a reminder that the year was really something impressive and the coronavirus didn't ruin everything,” Toobin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What becomes of divestment activism after Harvard has unveiled a timeline for its endowment to go carbon neutral?
Divest Harvard, the activist group that has spent years calling for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry, opened a new chapter of its movement with a virtual rally Wednesday, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.
The Zoom rally, which included more than 90 participants, featured speakers from across professions, including current undergraduates, environmentalists, and physicians on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Speakers at the rally included environmental activist and former Crimson President Bill E. McKibben ’82, Harvard Medical School instructor Gaurab Basu, Executive Director of Seeding Sovereignty Janet MacGillivray, Harvard’s Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History Fellow Kristina Shull, and several College student organizers.
In an email to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday afternoon, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that the University would “achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions overall by 2050” as a response to their overwhelming vote in favor of divestment.
“We appreciate that advocates for divestment from fossil fuel companies may not be satisfied with this approach, but we believe that divestment paints with too broad a brush,” Bacow wrote.
McKibben said the University’s decision to commit to going carbon neutral by 2050 marked progress, but that its environmental impact pales in comparison to the University of Oxford’s decision Tuesday to fully divest from the fossil fuel industry. He said that now, in response, organizers must push even harder.
“I wish you all didn’t have to do it,” he said. “I wish we were having an all-out party like they are having virtually at Oxford today.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment beyond Bacow’s message to the faculty.
During Wednesday’s rally, speakers drew parallels between the global coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis.
Jeremy Ornstein ’23, a student organizer for Divest Harvard and a speaker at the virtual rally, urged his fellow organizers to remember the sense of community they felt when demonstrating at this year’s Harvard-Yale game, when hundreds of demonstrators stormed the field as part of a divestment protest. Some of the protesters were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, but a Connecticut judge later dismissed the charges.
Ornstein urged listeners to draw upon that sense of solidarity in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
“We need a society that says ‘you’re sick, I’m sick, and I’m healthy, I’m gonna make sure you’re healthy,’” Ornstein said.
After the speeches, participants were placed into randomized breakout groups to discuss the “fight for climate justice in the time of COVID-19,” according to a post-rally press release issued by Divest Harvard. Participants in breakout rooms wrote letters to Harvard administrators and endowment managers, urging them to address climate justice and Harvard’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
Caleb D. Schwartz ’20, an inactive Crimson multimedia editor and a press representative for Divest Harvard, said he was happy with the outcome of the virtual rally, which the group originally planned to take place in Harvard Yard.
“We would ideally be out there in Harvard Yard speaking, but I think this was a good alternative,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz said he believes Harvard’s decision to commit to carbon neutrality has prompted greater student engagement with Divest.
“I've actually had three conversations today with new people who want to join the group,” Schwartz said. “Unexpectedly Harvard's decision to commit to carbon neutrality in such a lackluster and irresponsible way is actually bringing more people to our group.”
Divest Harvard wrote in the press release that their calls for divestment will continue as the divestment movement enters a new chapter.
“Today marks a new moment in our campaign as we pave the way for investment in a more socially just and environmentally sustainable system,” the press release reads.

You used to have to worry about Recinditas, but no one can see what you do when the Zoom cameras are off. This guide will help you spice up Virtual Visitas the way quarantine permits — so here’s to a not-so-traditional transformative experience.
Sleeping in a Dorm
It’s a shame you won’t have the pleasure of cozying up with an eager-to-impress freshman host, telling bedtime stories and sharing your deepest darkest secrets. Fret not! Find your old sleeping bag, put on your least bedraggled pajamas, and locate a nice, empty spot on the linoleum floor – it’ll simulate the exact feeling of sleeping in a Canaday double!
What’s the Move?
No more Advo, no more Owl. How oh how will you become a social butterfly! Look no further. You can rehearse looking for moves the true Harvard way. First, put on your most aggressively casual yet subtly suggestive outfit. Now, enter the first room in your house and glance about. Sit down effortlessly on a couch corner. Shake your parents’ hands, introduce yourself. Leave after no less than five but no more than ten minutes, when things “aren’t up to your standards.” Alternatively, you might claim you “just don’t vibe” or “need to get ‘nochs.” Repeat with every subsequent room in the house.
Sneaking Into Your Host’s Suite
Sh! Can’t wake your former-BFF host when you come back from your late-night escapades with tried and true new friends. Practice your evasion strategies by sneaking in and out of your house as many times as you can, until your mom notices and asks why you’re being an idiot. Pro tip: If you find this too easy, try wearing bells, carrying a heavy, oblong suitcase, or getting your siblings to act as fake “friends” to up the ante.
Getting Caught by a Proctor
Sure, you may not have the joy of being called out by a 20-something proctor for being ~under the influence~. It’s true you might never face the real threat of being rescinded for illicit substance use. But, that need not stop you. To mimic this experience, walk out of your front door, stand on the porch, and say loudly “I am not wearing appropriate PPE!” The ire of your neighbors and the threat of violence (perhaps even cruel words? sassy looks?) will serve in lieu of a proctor’s scowling glare.
Make a Drinking Game out of Virtual Visitas
What Dean Khurana doesn’t know won’t hurt him, and taking a shot every time he says “transformational” is a trite-but-surefire free space on your bingo card. A sip of wine for each time someone says “comp”? Power hour through the acapella jam? Don’t let the bingo card hold you back — options are abundant, and you owe it to the College to demonstrate you are a “creative thinker” in all facets of your college experience.
Meeting New “Peers”
There might not be a perfect substitute for running into fellow fresh-faced first years in the Science Center Plaza, but we’ve got the next best thing — just follow these simple steps. Open the Harvard 2024 Facebook page, select “Members,” close your eyes, and count to 17, all the while scrolling through the names. When you get to zero, open your eyes and see whose name you’ve landed on. Then immediately add them as a friend and send a long, carefully worded text on Messenger to introduce yourself and all of the extracurriculars you did in high school (p.s., don't forget to include your SAT score!). Remember, these friendships last a lifetime!
Waste not, want not, they say. With a little creativity, you can be certain that your homebound Visitas is well worth the time — and, dare I say, even more spicy than the real thing.
