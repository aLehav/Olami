After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reparations are back on the table. Or at the very least, they’ve made a return to the dinner conversation. In 2014, prominent journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates penned “The Case for Reparations,” an Atlantic article which argued that black Americans should receive restitution for slavery. The piece was widely discussed but dismissed by politicians across the board. Today, a surge of activism around racial inequality has pushed the Democrats to consider the issue again.
By the looks of it, that activism is succeeding. Whether it’s because they want to appease a passionate base or because they genuinely believe in the idea, several Democratic presidential candidates have voiced some level of support for reparations.
The emotional case for reparations is strong. America’s democracy was built on black laborers’ backs; whites were offered life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness while African Americans picked cotton and bore unflinching barbarism. When slavery ended in 1865, there was no apology for this brutalist past. There was no healing process, reconciliation, or widespread acknowledgement.
Instead, there was a failed Freedmen’s Bureau and a series of exploitative work practices. These set in place the characteristics — both structural and cultural — that underlie racial inequality today. Reparations are an apology and repayment to black citizens whose ancestors were forced into the slave trade. They are the first step in acknowledging as a country that hundreds of years of slavery and institutional racism has caused mass harm to black people.
Yet this is where the impact of reparations end; they are a step, not a program. They are a symbolic gesture, not a long term solution. And in my view, they are a step backwards.
First, there is the issue of practicality: who should be paid, how they should be paid, and who should be doing the paying? Will the money will be manifest in a lump sum payment or a series of government programs? Does it go into communities or family pockets? Should it go to all black people or only the descendants of slaves? What about victims of Jim Crow and redlining, or those who have since left the country? Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision for reparations famously included poor white workers. Attempting to decide who qualifies could provide fertile ground for toxicity.
The cost of monetary reparations is estimated to be in the range of six and 14 trillion dollars — for context, the proposed federal budget for 2020 is 4.7 trillion dollars. Worse still, if this amount of money is spread out across the 13.4 percent of the population that is African American, it will not be enough to make a meaningful difference to individual families. It will not lift people out of poverty, nor will it improve life in predominantly black communities.
Then, there’s the political question. Support for reparations has already put a gloss on Democratic candidates with mixed records advocating for people of color. And even in the event that some form of reparations are paid, they will be wielded as a political weapon. Their existence will be used as evidence for the illusion that America has solved the race problem; an invisible cloak for those who want to hide behind the notion that “an irreparable past can be set straight with a handout.”
As a matter of immediacy, don’t be fooled into thinking that this issue will help force Donald Trump out of the White House. If you tell a 40-year-old out of work white working class man in middle America that part of his taxpayer money will help repay the black population, don’t be surprised to see his racial resentments rise. Political battles are won by articulating a vision for all, not by pitting segments of the people against one another. Some proponents have argued that reparations will provide “closure.” They are far more likely to tear healing racial wounds back open.
Finally, there lies the question of what reparations represent.
The answers are not pretty. Inherited guilt. Ancestral claims. Social balance sheets. A national negotiation table. White people born with original sin and patronization as a replacement for progress. Reparations commodify what ought not to be commodified — they divert attention from the obstacles that keep black America where it ought never to have been.
At a time when the president is stoking a narrative of white victimhood, it is easy to understand why a reckoning with America’s past would be worthwhile. But take a proper look at that history and you will see a nation that has made significant progress; you will see that a citizen’s race matters less today than at any point in America’s existence.
Perhaps there was a time when reparations could have worked — a time when the black community’s moral claims would have been best addressed by rebate. The road towards reconciliation would have been quicker and less painful. That it did not happen is a catastrophe, but that window has now passed.
Today’s problems have solutions that don’t bring racial divides nearer to the foreground: fixing the public school system; criminal justice reform; an end to the war on drugs. Money must be invested, but on the state and local level. Not to one segment of the population, but to all those who need it.
There is a time for the symbolic and there is a time for the practical. Today’s political moment is crying out for the practical. America needs cohesion, consolidation, and coalition. It does not need quid pro quo and a reinforcement of racial divides.
If reparations are a step, they are a step in the wrong direction. They were a missed opportunity. They became a forgotten conversation. Now, they are a harmful, impractical, and divisive distraction.

Google “Harvard University Dining Hours.” One of the first results claims that Harvard University Dining Services are open from 7 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. This is, to put it nicely, a lie. In reality, Harvard dining halls are open for just a fraction of this time.
If you want breakfast between 10:15 and 11:30 a.m., Dunkin’ Donuts is open. If you are hungry between 2:30 and 5:00 p.m., you can go to Felipe’s or plenty of other restaurants in Harvard Square. But if you want to eat in campus dining halls during these times, you are simply out of luck.
For many Harvard students, this schedule does not impose a burden. Going to eat somewhere in Harvard Square because the dining hall is not open is entirely normal for students who can afford it. However, for a significant portion of the student body, the new class schedules, coupled with limited dining hall hours, mean that there is often not enough time to eat at a Harvard dining hall. For many of these same students, spending money to eat at a restaurant because the dining hall is closed is not financially viable. Money is an issue for a large number of Harvard students, and the current dining system is unequally harming those who cannot afford to dine elsewhere.
While the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative is generous and provides many opportunities for low-income students that would not be present at other colleges, the glaring effects that the dining system can have on these students cannot be ignored. Although the issue may not appear to be one of equality on the surface, it is clear that those who are affected by the current state of dining are low-income students who cannot afford alternatives.
While it is easy to recognize that Harvard’s dining services are far from perfect, finding a solution has proven more challenging. Keeping all dining halls open for longer, continuous hours has been a long dream of Harvard students. Yet, this would lead to considerable costs that would never be approved. Instead of such a massive shift in dining services, a more limited change could address this problem. Harvard should keep the majority of dining halls on the current schedule while leaving a single dining hall open continuously from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. — without restrictions — to improve students’ access to food.
It would be ideal if this dining hall were to be in a centralized location somewhere on campus, but very few dining halls fit this description. In fact, there is one dining hall that could be described as centralized: the dining hall of the Inn at Harvard.
The Inn could have its schedule changed so that breakfast is served from 7 to 11 a.m., lunch from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and dinner from 5 to 7 p.m. This would entail only changing the schedule of a single dining hall, and in return increase food accessibility to countless students.
Similar models where not all dining services are open at all times but at least one remains open almost all the time have been implemented to great success elsewhere. For example, Brown University has introduced a system where some dining halls provide service during 7 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., while other dining halls remain open until 2 a.m. The continuous access to food that this kind of system provides narrows one of the inequality gaps that is ever present in the minds of those affected by it.
If the change has been successfully implemented at other schools, why could it not be done here? All students deserve to be able to eat. Limiting students to a narrow window in which they can eat is unacceptable, especially considering how many of students have schedules limit their time to eat. Opening a single dining hall during the hours when others are closed would alleviate this issue. Harvard should take this step towards becoming a more equal place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid reports of increased need for mental health resources, April has seen a handful of new mental health programming on Harvard’s campus. Last week, Harvard hosted  “Young, Gifted, & Well” — a day-long conference focused on promoting discussion about mental health and wellness among students of color across the University. The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response has also held events geared toward promoting self-care in the Houses. This initiative — which features calming do-it-yourself stations, including stress balls, “affirmation cards,” and body scrubs — comes as part of OSAPR’s broader effort to increase student engagement through its “community engagement model.”
The unfortunate reality is that mental health is a pervasive issue on this campus. A May 2018 survey found more than one in seven surveyed undergraduates reported their emotional health has had a negative effect on their academic performance. But this is not only an undergraduate issue. According to a Harvard University Health Services survey conducted last fall, graduate student respondents in four Faculty of Arts and Sciences programs reported rates of depression and anxiety as high as 31 percent. In addition, students across the University seeking help at Counseling and Mental Health Services continue to face overwhelmed support staff and long wait times for appointments.
Given the prevalence of mental health concerns on campus, resources and support centered around mental health and self-care must be prioritized at Harvard. The recent programming coordinated by OSAPR and the University at large are necessary steps in that work. We particularly commend the aims underlying these initiatives such as promoting the discussion of mental health in communities of color and providing accessible programming to support student wellness in their day-to-day lives.
We especially appreciate OSAPR’s work to provide visible support to students on-campus like the office’s work to meet students in their own Houses. As we have opined in the past, OSAPR’s shift under director Pierre R. Berastaín Ojeda ’10 toward a model focused on “pastoral care” is a necessary and admirable step in reimagining mental health services, through offering engaged and person-focused opportunities to meet students where they are with their specific needs.
Likewise, the “Young, Gifted, & Well” conference addressed the specific mental health challenges of students from marginalized backgrounds — another example of the University working to fulfill student needs more completely. Though the conference is only an initial step, it lays the foundation for an important set of conversations often overlooked on campus.
In order to meaningfully address mental health issues, however, institutional change must accompany the community engagement initiatives we have lauded. Welcome as they are, actions such as these are not enough. Harvard must ensure that the existing mental health infrastructure on campus does not continue to falter. For example, as some students have argued, CAMHS should work to hire a more diverse group of clinicians to serve student needs. If financial constraints prevent these new hires, as officials have previously stated, the University must prioritize an increase in funding for CAMHS.
While we are proud of the work individual sectors of the University have spearheaded in service of bolstering wellness and self-care on campus, Harvard must step up and more aggressively address the issue of supporting mental health on campus through more institutional forms of change if it is earnestly dedicated to this cause.

Harvard University Health Services Urgent Care will no longer see patients in-person between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. beginning June 17, HUHS announced Tuesday.
Students who wish to be seen between those hours can call an urgent care line and speak with a tele-nurse or and must be treated at a local hospital if they require immediate care. HUHS first established its nurse advice line in December 2018.
The line was originally launched to “complement our in-person overnight urgent care services,” HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates and their families Tuesday afternoon. He wrote that the tele-nurse system — which connects callers to a registered nurse — will replace all in-person urgent care visits during nighttime hours.
When calling between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., the nurse advice line connects students to registered nurses through health services company Citra Health Solutions. Nurses then provide advice ranging from home-care instructions, to future appointments, to emergency room visits.
Barreira wrote that a semester-long pilot of the Citra system has convinced administrators of its viability as an in-person urgent care replacement.
“Our semester-long experience with Citra has proven successful, safe, and effective for our patients,” Barreira wrote.
Under the new system, overnight mental health consultations will not change. Barreira indicated that Citra will connect students seeking mental health services with an HUHS Mental Health On-Call Clinician. In alignment with current procedures, students with mental health emergencies will be sent to Cambridge Hospital.
Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi said in an interview that the new system allows urgent care services to be more streamlined.
“You never get the middle person where you have to give all this information and wait,” she said.
Francesconi said students have not frequently made use of in-person urgent care services that currently exist, and that many students who do come in person require transportation to an emergency room anyway. She said that overnight urgent care received 227 calls in February 2019, during which 15 people came to HUHS in person and six were ultimately directed to an emergency room.
Barreira and Francesconi said they are confident in the “sophisticated” answers that the tele-nurses provide.
As a prerequisite for working, the nurses must have previously spent five years working in Medical-Surgical Nursing or the Emergency Room, according to Francesconi. Nurses use a computer system to guide their response to patients’ symptoms.
Under the tele-nurse system, conversations with patients are recorded and nurses are required to follow up with students to see how they carried out the advice and how the treatment went.
When students are directed to hospital emergency rooms, Francesconi said the process will remain the same — students may take taxis if their condition permits,
"The ambulance is the insurance piece,” Francesconi said. “There are many situations in which we have facilitated transportation to the emergency room through HUPD. We've given taxis if we can do that. We really try very hard to make a clinical decision about the level of severity of what needs to happen in terms of transportation to the emergency room and that's happening now.”
This is not the first time that HUHS significantly remodeled their overnight services. In 2015, HUHS closed Stillman Infirmary. Stillman Infirmary provided an inpatient space with a limited number of beds to students needing short-term care. The infirmary often serviced intoxicated students who came to HUHS as part of the College’s amnesty policy.
The closing of Stillman Infirmary and the reallocation of resources because of the closing allowed Counseling and Mental Health Services to expand. HUHS was also able to undergo renovations to create a “welcoming” space, according to Francesconi.
Despite the modified hours, Urgent Care will continue to operate 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

A few months ahead of the Dean of Students Office's one-year anniversary, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said administrators have been “making a lot of progress” toward their goals following the merger of the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life.
“I think we have really created this organization that supports all four years,” O’Dair said in an interview Tuesday. “I think we’re really looking forward to our second year of the new organization with building upon the work we’ve done.”
O’Dair said much of the office’s work during the 2018-19 academic year has been focused on inward-facing initiatives, such as integrating the personnel, finance, and human resources infrastructure of the two “really significant” organizations. The office plans to formally review its efforts over the past year to support the student body, she said.
“We’re undergoing program review right now in the DSO. We’re going to start that with our one-year review, which doesn’t sound that exciting,” O’Dair said. “But to us, it’s really making sure that the things we’re doing now, the resources, the staffing, are all toward student-facing student experience, and to assess the things we’ve done for years, and to see if they're meeting the needs of — the current needs of — today’s students.”
The FDO and OSL merged to form the DSO in July 2018. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the merger in an email last April that the purpose of the consolidation was to “centralize services” offered by both former offices. The merger also sought to “link each student’s first-year experience with their sophomore experience in an intentional way,” according to Khurana’s email at the time.
O’Dair said she is looking forward to working with Nekesa C. Straker — the new senior assistant dean of residential life and first-year students — as the office strives to create a sense of continuity in the undergraduate residential experience “from orientation through handoff to the houses.” As part of this process, she said the DSO hopes to strengthen connections between freshman students and programmatic offices at the College.
“I think we have spent a lot of time thinking about that handoff to the sophomore year, and I think even more so now that we’re going to have that team in place,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair highlighted the new “sleep module” — an online training module about healthy sleeping habits that incoming members of the Class of 2022 were required to complete — as an example of new programming for freshmen students.
As she looked back on the DSO’s progress over the past year, O’Dair also gave a preview of the office’s priorities for the next academic year.
The DSO will pursue closer collaboration with the Office of Undergraduate Education and other campus offices to focus on supporting the first-generation student experience, O’Dair said.
“We know students have one experience,” O’Dair said. “They don't have just separate experiences in the classroom and outside of the classroom.”
The office will also be launching a new website in August, as well as continuing to support professional development opportunities for its staff.

Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said he does not think student-athletes should be paid while at Harvard in an interview last month, joining in a national conversation about student-athlete compensation.
“At Harvard, I do not think athletes should be paid. In a sense, they will be paid down the road, learning some great lessons that they use to pursue their lives in a meaningful way,” he said.
Proponents of paying student-athletes argue that schools profit from major athletic programs, while their student-athletes do not reap the financial benefits.
Scalise said, however, that student-athletes at Harvard should not incur costs while playing their sports. He said it is appropriate for colleges to cover such costs as computers, winter coats, and travel to and from home during vacation periods. He added that student-athletes should not receive cash.
Scalise also focused on the role of academics in student athletes’ lives at Harvard.
“I believe people should come here to get an education, not just to play their sport,” he said. “You're coming here to get an education. Athletics is part of it, but not the sole reason for you to be here.”
Scalise also said that student-athletes should not receive “preferential treatment” in terms of the classes they take and that student athletes’ lives should resemble those of other students as much as possible.
“Because we want them to walk across the stage and have their Faculty Dean give them a diploma that says, ‘You met the same standard as every other student who's receiving a diploma today. You didn't meet the standard by taking more time than anyone else to get through the degree, having your hand held through this whole process,’” Scalise said.
This also includes having student-athletes live in the same dorms and “eat in the same dining rooms, with the same food” as students not involved in varsity athletics, according to Scalise.
Scalise also indicated that this should apply to college admissions. He said he believes prospective student-athletes should go through the same processes as other applicants to the College.
“At Harvard, and within the Ivy League, students should be admitted by the same processes,” he said. “And we should make sure that we're admitting students who are representative of the student body.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s female tenured faculty members are on average paid 92.5 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn, according to a recent nationwide survey on higher education compensation.
The survey, conducted by the American Association of University Professors, collects salary data across position and gender from 1,093 colleges and universities. The survey includes information about 1,019 of Harvard’s tenured professors, 144 associate professors, 217 assistant professors, and 149 “instructors” — likely referring to certain non-ladder faculty such as lecturers, preceptors, or fellows — in its tabulations, according to Inside Higher Ed, which compiled the AAUP data.
Tenured positions are lifetime appointments; for Harvard’s less senior faculty, the gender pay gap is slimmer. Female associate professors are paid 95.4 cents on the dollar on average as compared to male associate professors, and female assistant professors are paid 96.6 cents on the dollar. Female faculty categorized as instructors by the survey are paid roughly $1.04 on the dollar.
Harvard’s pay gap places it roughly in the middle of the Ivy League. While no Ivy League school has reached pay equity for tenured faculty, Brown and Yale are the closest at roughly 95 cents on the dollar on average. Dartmouth sits at the bottom at only 82.5 cents.
Gender pay disparities persist despite federal laws designed to combat discrimination. Though the 1963 Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act both prohibit gender discrimination in the distribution of salary and benefits, women continue to earn approximately 85 percent of what men earn in the United States, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center analysis. But that gap shrinks after controlling for certain factors such as profession.
Overall, Harvard boasts the fourth-highest average salary for tenured professors of any university in the dataset at $244,300, surpassed only by Columbia, Stanford, and Princeton. Harvard also ranks high in compensation for its tenure-track faculty. Associate professors at the University earn the seventh-highest average salary at $144,600, and assistant professors receive an average salary of $134,600, an amount topped only by Stanford among colleges surveyed.
Harvard fared worse in the ranking of non-tenure track faculty pay, coming in at 91st in average salary for instructors. The average compensation for these individuals — some of whom work part-time at the University — is $68,400, roughly half the amount the next highest-ranking faculty are paid.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the survey.
Over the past four years, the gender pay gap among Harvard’s faculty has remained relatively constant, even as salaries have risen by roughly 15 percent. In 2015, female tenured professors at the University earned approximately 92.3 cents for every one dollar earned by a male professor on average — roughly the same as in 2019. Though the gender pay gap narrowed from 95.7 cents on the dollar in 2015 to reach equity in 2018 for associate professors, it increased again to 95.4 cents on the dollar in 2019. On the other hand, the pay gap for assistant professors has decreased steadily since 2015.
A faculty diversity survey released by the University in early April showed incremental progress in the hiring of female faculty members: 27 percent of Harvard’s tenured faculty are now women, compared to roughly 40 percent of tenure-track professors. Those figures have risen from 19 and 35 percent, respectively, since 2004, and administrators say they remain committed to continuing increasing faculty diversity.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana declined to comment on the Winthrop House “climate review” and a lawsuit brought by a pair of Winthrop tutors against an Eliot House faculty dean in a Tuesday interview.
Khurana began the interview by saying he did not want to comment on either matter, citing their pending status. Khurana last spoke about the climate review in an interview last month, shortly after it began.
“I think I’m not going to talk about anything in which there’s sort of current or pending litigation,” Khurana said Tuesday. “And also, I’m not going to comment on the Winthrop situation because we’re still in the process of the climate survey.”
Khurana has previously commented and made statements about pending lawsuits related to the College, including the ongoing admissions case.
In a separate interview, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair declined to comment on Winthrop tutors Carl L. Miller and Valencia Miller’s defamation lawsuit against Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe. She also declined to comment on whether her office, which oversees residential life including the undergraduate houses, has been involved in the dispute. The College is not a party in the Millers' lawsuit.
The College launched a climate review of Winthrop in February in the wake of student outcry over Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s Jan. 23 announcement that he would represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces several accusations of sexual assault.
The three months since Sullivan’s announcement have seen both calls from undergraduates asking him to step down from his post as faculty dean and open letters supporting his decision to represent Weinstein.
Khurana tapped former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 to lead the climate review intended to gather data and information surrounding “climate concerns” in Winthrop House in February.
As administrators began the review, some undergraduates organized protests and circulated letters arguing that Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein and his response to student concerns are incompatible with his role as a faculty dean.
Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20 — an Eliot resident and Crimson design editor — has led calls for Sullivan to step down. Weeks into her activism, she was involved in a confrontation with the Millers in Winthrop dining hall on April 3. Mudannayake alleges that Carl Miller took photos and video of her, while Miller alleges she harassed him and his family. The two filed conflicting reports with Harvard University Police Department about the incident.
Days later, O’Keefe defended Mudannayake and wrote that the Millers acted “unprofessionally” in an April 8 email to Eliot residents. The Millers later filed a defamation lawsuit against O’Keefe, alleging that the April 8 email and a text she sent to Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers in March included “false and defamatory statements.”
On Tuesday, Khurana did not directly respond to a series of questions about the events in Winthrop and Eliot that took place over the past several weeks.
Asked about the confrontation between Mudannayake and the Millers, O’Keefe’s email, and the Millers’ defamation suit, Khurana said the College is “trying to get an overall picture of everything that's going on in the Winthrop situation.”
A pair of Winthrop students wrote a Medium post Friday stating they would be transferring out of the House due to their concerns about Sullivan and his recent leadership of Winthrop. Asked about the post, Khurana again pointed to the ongoing climate survey.
“We're trying to gather all the information that we can that can be used to address the issues that are identified, as well as strengthen the things where people think things are going well,” he said.
Khurana also declined to comment on the Millers’ decision to subpoena several Harvard affiliates and did not answer a question on whether and how Harvard intervenes in disputes between staff and students.

The Cambridge Planning Board convened Tuesday evening to discuss plans for construction at the Crimson Galeria in Harvard Square, which were ultimately postponed.
The Crimson Galeria, located at 57 JFK St. in Harvard Square, houses shops and restaurants including Staples, Shake Shack, and Tom’s Bao Bao. The proposed construction would add an additional three floors to the existing Galeria building. Each subsequent floor would take up approximately three-fourths of the square footage of the previous floor.
Since 2014, Raj Dhanda — a local developer overseeing the current construction proposal — has worked to pass an assortment of construction plans at the site. His 2014 proposal to add three stories of residential units to the top of the Galeria building was declined due to concerns about shadows in the adjacent Winthrop Park.
Marilee B. Meyer, a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said in an interview Tuesday that she lobbied against the original construction plans in 2014 because of concerns about shadows.
“The original design was too tall, too big — it shadowed the park altogether,” Meyer said.
Peter Quinn, a Somerville-based architect overseeing the plans for construction at 57 JFK St., said in an interview that he thought that the construction would have a negligible impact on the aesthetics of the neighborhood. During the meeting, Quinn presented a number of proposed designs to the committee demonstrating, arguing that the additional floors would not be very visible from the street.
Members of the planning board raised concerns about space’s gross floor area allotments. Under Cambridge’s zoning ordinances, the City Council can control how much floor area is allotted to different spaces across Cambridge.
The group representing 57 JFK St., called Crimson Galeria LP, hoped to change the space’s floor area at Tuesday’s meeting by petitioning to exempt the basement of the building from being counted in the overall area metric. This exemption would lower the group’s required contribution to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund.
The board, which declined to hear public comment on the issue, unanimously voted to postpone a verdict until they can consult the Cambridge City Solicitor.
Abra Berkowitz, a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said she appreciated that the planning committee decided to delay the vote.
“I feel bad for the petitioner, but there are some kinks that need to be worked out,” Berkowitz said. “Since this plan is almost a million dollars... I think it’s something that needs to be taken very seriously.”
According to the meeting’s agenda, Crimson Galeria also wanted to pursue exemptions for parking and loading requirements that are required for spaces in the Harvard Square Overlay District. The planning committee’s decision, however, also postponed discussion of these exemptions.
Dhanda said he was disappointed with the board’s verdict.
“We were hoping to get the approval,” Dhanda said. “Now we just wait and see what the solicitor has to say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Winthrop undergraduates wrote and circulated a Medium post about their decision to transfer houses following Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan’s announcement he will represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault.
Caroline R. Kaufman ’21 and Allison J. Scharmann ’21, a Crimson arts editor, published the post on April 19. They criticized his handling of student concerns and wrote that Sullivan’s decision “felt like a slap in the face” because they both have experienced sexual assault.
Kaufman and Scharmann also said in an interview they are aware of at least three other Winthrop students for whom Sullivan was a factor in their decision to transfer out of the House.
After Sullivan announced his decision to represent Weinstein in late January, he sent out a pair of emails — the first defending his decision and the second outlining a series of “processes” meant to allay student concerns, including designating Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the “point person” for matters related to sexual harassment.
Kaufman and Scharmann wrote that Sullivan and fellow Winthrop Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson’s decision to direct sexual harassment-related concerns to Chavers showed that Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein conflicts with his role as a faculty dean.
“By deferring all sexual assault reporting responsibilities to Winthrop Resident Dean Dr. Linda Chavers, Sullivan has acknowledged his compromised ability  —  in the eyes of the Winthrop Community  —  to listen to, acknowledge, and support them in such matters,” Kaufman and Scharmann wrote.
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment.
Kaufman said in an interview Monday that she successfully applied to transfer in the first round of applications, which were due Feb. 11.
Scharmann applied in the second round — which is open until May 20 — and has not yet heard whether the Dean of Students Office approved her application. In addition to filling out the interhouse transfer form, Scharmann contacted College Title IX coordinator Emily J. Miller to inform Miller she wanted to transfer because she felt "uncomfortable" about Sullivan's decision to represent Weinstein and his subsequent "public comments" and "communications" about the matter. Scharmann said Miller wrote that she would flag Scharmann’s request for the DSO.
“To be honest, I'm not 100 percent sure they’re going to transfer me out of Winthrop,” Scharmann said. “I will consider moving off campus if I don’t get transferred, which would not be ideal. I think I can use financial aid for that purpose, but as a student on full financial aid, I am a little bit worried about my housing situation if I’m not transferred.”
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Title IX policy states that Miller and other coordinators may offer students who report experience with sexual and gender-based harassment a series of interim measures, including changes to their housing arrangements.
“Consistent with FAS policy, interim measures might include, among others: restrictions on contact; course-schedule or work-schedule alteration; changes in housing; leaves of absence; or increased monitoring of certain areas of the campus,” the policy reads.
Remedy H. Ryan ’21, an organizer with anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she has heard from both undergraduates and Harvard staff that the Title IX office would work with students to facilitate transfer requests. Ryan also said she heard that freshmen who have experience with sexual assault had the option of requesting not to be placed in Winthrop.
“I think there are probably like a lot of survivors who didn’t know that was an option, especially freshmen, who didn’t know it was an option to not be put in Winthrop or still don’t really know much about the situation, but will probably have a very different experience of it once they're inside the house,” Ryan said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It felt only fitting that the third out of Kieran Shaw’s record-breaking save would be a comebacker right at the junior.
Shaw jogged most of the way towards first base, tossing the ball softly into first baseman Pat McColl’s glove, sealing a 2-1 Harvard win over Dartmouth in the first game of a doubleheader on Sunday. As important as the victory was for a Crimson team then tied for first place in the Ancient Eight, the real story was Shaw’s 12th save — the most ever for an Ivy League pitcher in a single season, and the exclamation mark on an explosive season few could have seen coming.
Through Shaw’s first two seasons in Cambridge, the right-hander compiled just eight total saves, starting three games and posting an ERA around 6.85. Suddenly, in the third year of his career, the Los Gatos, Calif., native has emerged with a record-breaking season complemented by an ERA of just 3.24, and has earned the third most saves in the country. Those that know Shaw will be quick to point out that this breakout is no surprise.
“It happens all the time with a lot of guys, there’s always an adjustment period for every college player,” said senior pitcher Kevin Stone, the elder statesman of the staff. “If you ask anyone on the team, they’d say they expect this out of him because of how talented he is and how hard he works.”
Shaw’s emergence has been no small part of Harvard’s success this season. As the Crimson enter the final six games of Ivy League play, the team hopes to return to its first NCAA Regional since the 2005 season. Since the 2006 campaign, Harvard has yet to finish an Ivy League regular season in first place, but the Crimson recently won five straight series and a strong series next weekend at home against Columbia could help break that drought.
While Shaw’s record might only be 0-2, any baseball fan can tell you that 12 saves in 14 appearances is an elite mark for any closer. As Coach Bill Decker’s team picks up momentum, much of its confidence in ballgames stems from knowing that No. 17 is coming out of the bullpen to protect the lead — confidence that is infectious across the entire roster.
“In the Ivy League every game matters,” Stone explained. “Having Kieran, a closer in the back of the bullpen that you’re confident in knowing he’s gonna get the job done, it’s extremely important for us.”
Shaw’s 12 saves broke the 11-save record previously set by Yale’s Brett Rosenthal in 2006, and matched by Dartmouth’s Ryan Smith in 2009. Now, one decade later, Shaw’s name will enter the record books atop the 26 years of Ancient Eight baseball, setting the new mark of 12 saves or more.
With an ERA lower than half of what it was in either of his first two seasons, Shaw’s turnaround is undeniable. But the product of Bellarmine College Prep. is quick to point to the summer as the cause of his success.
“I really got the chance to get into a routine this summer,” Shaw explained. “When you get used to doing something, like closing games, you really start to believe you can do it well.”
In high school, Shaw was a two-sport athlete at Bellarmine, starring both on the diamond and contributing on the football field as well. In his senior season, the right-hander was honored as the Bellarmine pitcher of the year in 2016, and was named captain. In college, however, it took two years for Shaw to truly hit his stride.
Record-breaking aside, the 2019 season has not been without its tribulations for the junior, who has overcome two heartbreaking losses against Yale at home and UMass in the Beanpot finals, ceding multiple runs in the 9th innings to blow both saves. Despite writing his name into the record books, with eight games remaining to build on his 12 saves, Shaw credits those blown saves and losses for keeping him desperate to improve.
“We always talk about using what happened in those games as a tool to channel our energy and our mechanics,” Shaw said of the losses. “Instead of getting down on yourself, move on and refocus.”
While many might focus upon the intimidating 6’0 frame that comes through the bullpen doors in the ninth inning, Shaw plays a myriad of roles during the lengthy three-hour games, from handing umpires water cups to cracking jokes in the bullpen.
And while the closer’s scowl might intimidate the hitters that step into the batter's box, his fellow pitchers and teammates know Shaw as a light-hearted and genuine player.
“His work ethic is through the roof,” Stone said. “But in the locker room he’s someone that’s very approachable for younger players and to just shoot the breeze with.”
With over two weeks left in the season, Kieran Shaw will have the opportunity to build upon what has already been a record-breaking season. His name etched into the Ivy League single-season record books, Shaw will turn his attention to helping Harvard return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 14 seasons, a task he views as far more important.
“I really don’t care about individual records,” Shaw attested. “I care about winning an Ivy League championship.”
While the Crimson’s outlook on winning the Ivy League remain very possible, much uncertainty remains. With sophomore standout Buddy Hayward exiting his start at Dartmouth after just a pair of innings, Harvard may turn to Stone if Hayward is forced to miss time. But while some elements of the Crimson’s roster may be murky, others are as consistent as “Sweet Caroline” playing in the 8th inning of Red Sox games.
Not least amongst those, Kieran Shaw, trotting in from the bullpen in the 9th inning — ready to lock down yet another save to add to his record.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matt Freese checked off one more box in his rapid six-month transition from Harvard sophomore to professional soccer player this past Saturday, seeing his first game action for Major League Soccer’s Philadelphia Union.
The 20-year-old Homegrown Player — who hails from nearby Wayne, Pa., — subbed in for starting goalkeeper Andre Blake about 10 minutes into the second half after Blake suffered a groin injury. Freese did not make any saves in the ensuing 36 minutes as the Union eased to a 3-0 victory over the Montreal Impact.
Freese is just one of 11 Crimson alumni to be selected by a Major League Soccer team and just the fourth Harvard player in the past six years to play in a regular-season MLS game. Midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu ‘17 appeared once in 2018 for Atlanta United, while Andre Akpan ‘09 and current Harvard assistant coach Mike Fucito ‘08-’09 previously represented the New York Red Bulls and San Jose Earthquakes, respectively.
Despite the lack of activity between the goalposts, Freese commented postgame on how his journey with the Union has come full circle since attending Philadelphia’s first-ever MLS game in 2010.
“It’s crazy, I mean seeing my mom right there [who was in attendance on Saturday] is wild,” said Freese in an interview on PHL17. “She used to bring me to all the games. I am just happy I was able to play in front of her, in front of everyone else and little kids like me who wanted to play here 10 years ago.”
The Episcopal Academy product admitted he felt the jitters preparing to take the field, but was eased in by his coaching staff and teammates.
“Walking out on the field, I could feel my heart was racing,” said Freese in The Delaware County Daily Times. “But as soon as the game started, I started talking to the back four, started touching the ball and it was pretty routine, pretty normal honestly, which is great.”
Up next, the Union will travel to Vancouver this Saturday to take on the Whitecaps. Although Blake is expected to be out for about three-to-four weeks (according to Jamaica national team coach Roy Simpson), Freese will face competition for the starting spot from fellow backup keeper Carlos Miguel Coronel. The 22-year-old Brazilian keeper and Red Bull Salzburg loanee missed Saturday Union’s game while concurrently suiting up for the Union’s developmental team, Bethlehem Steel FC.
Union coach Jim Curtin remained non-committal following the contest on his upcoming choice as the team’s replacement keeper. Coronel was Curtin’s choice to fill in for Blake when the long-time Union starter was called up for international duty in late-March.
“Andre[Blake] is a huge piece to our team, so it’s a big loss, but we believe in Carlos [Miguel Coronel]. We believe in Matt Freese,” Curtin said. “They’re going to probably have opportunities in the coming weeks.”
Prior to Saturday’s backup efforts, Freese started in three games this season for Bethlehem Steel FC. The netminder earned a shutout in Steel FC’s first contest of 2019 at Birmingham, with a 2-1 overall record.
At Harvard, Freese earned Second-Team All-Ivy League honors this past season and holds a college career save tally of 77 in 16 matches played. The Union Academy product has previously represented the U.S. up to the U-19 level, and trained with Manchester United while racking up Delaware County Player of the Year honors in high school.
“[Harvard soccer] was just a great group of people, and I’m just really happy to be a part of the team, that family,” said Freese in a preseason conference call. “I think the most memorable experience was the Yale game this past season in which we shut them out. Off the field, I think just meeting everyone. Just being here, there is a wide variety of people and diverse group of people…it has inspired me and something that will definitely stick with me for the rest of my life.”
More clarity will likely be made after the practice sessions end this week on Freese’s starting status, but the 20-year-old, who just months ago was roaming Harvard Square, can now officially see his name in the Major League Soccer stat sheet.

First impressions only happen once. And when considering where to spend the next four years of your life, the first impression of college is make it or break it. So hosting a prefrosh can feel like a lot of pressure, especially when a typical Harvard student’s day is driven by a semi-predictable Google Calendar with an impossible goal of eating dinner by 7:15 p.m. before the dhall closes. Not to worry, future Visitas host! We have your back with these three easy steps to give your prefrosh a first impression of Harvard they won’t forget.
Step 1: Prepare Your Room 
Putting a little effort into cleaning your room will go a long way in making your prefrosh feel at home. You don’t need to go crazy here, but maybe that half-eaten bag of Lay’s and collection of mugs you never seem to get around to washing need to finally be dealt with. If you don’t have a river daddy you can spend the night with to free up your own bed, then consider borrowing an air mattress from someone in your entryway.
Step 2: Give A Personalized Tour
Scope out your prefrosh’s interests, and then curate a tour for them based on what they’d enjoy. If they’re an athlete, take them across the river to see their future facilities, and be sure to point out where the Powerade is in the dhall (bonus points: Have them prepare their tray with two cups, and they’ll fit right in). Don’t just show them Lamont, but take them into the cafe and point out the corner you cried in at 3 a.m. the day of the Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” midterm. Harvard is the sum of its people: the good, the bad, and the crazy, so don’t leave out any of the details. Your prefrosh wants to feel like a real student. Share insider tips like Board Plus, how Annenberg is actually called “the Berg,” the debate about El Jefe’s versus Felipe’s, and which classes are true gems.
Step 3: Encourage Them to Actually Attend Visitas Events
This one’s partially for your own sanity. Hosting can be exhausting (Harvard kids aren’t used to this much socializing). Be sure to take some time for yourself. A great way to do this is to take advantage of all the admissions programming offered. It’s important that prefrosh get to know each other, even if it is in slightly forced, always awkward, school-sponsored settings. Some people meet their best friends at Visitas (or future blockmates they’ll fall out with). Regardless, it’s all part of the journey, and free food is usually involved.
Harvard, in all its mystique, faults, and glory, can seem intimidating. But once your prefrosh realizes no Harvard student actually knows what they’re doing with their life, some of the nerves will fade away. Remind them that the Harvard experience is so much bigger than the Yard, and that getting in is really the hardest part. After all, to graduate you just have to complete three easy tasks (which you may share at your own discretion). Happy hosting!

Dearest Prefrosh,
It’s almost Visitas: the weekend you’ve been looking forward to since you were blessed by the admissions gods, the only chance you have to find your friends for life (or meet that kid you’ve been crushing on from the Class of 2023 group chat), and the only opportunity you will have to experience Harvard before attending (because, duh, of course you’re gonna choose Harvard). But alas, your parents are forcing you to attend your cousin’s wedding, and now life at Harvard as you know it is ruined. Except that it’s not, because we’re here to tell you that Visitas is not that deep.
We’ll admit, the events that take place during the weekend of Visitas do have their appeal. We love tons of free food just as much as the next person does. Luckily for you, though, the perks of Harvard’s overflowing wallet don’t end at Visitas. Harvard will continue to flex its ability to keep you well-fed during the next four years … Add this to the list of reasons to choose Harvard! We can’t guarantee that other schools have the same selection of boba or mozzarella sticks.
Besides missing out on free t-shirts, you may be worried you’re missing an opportunity to get to know Harvard’s campus. This is understandable, especially since the last time you toured the campus you were too distracted by the impending doom that was college applications. Don’t worry, though — there are plenty of other ways to get familiarized with campus. From online tours to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s legendary Instagram, you can learn a ton about campus while avoiding the cost of the trip. Suddenly, your cousin’s wedding isn’t looking so bad after all.
We didn’t forget about the 72-hour bonding experience you were hoping to have. After all, anytime you ask about what makes Harvard special, the response is “the people.” While Visitas can be a way to hit it off with fellow prefrosh, missing Visitas will not make or break your college social life. Everyone will arrive in the fall with the same excitement. Plus, considering most of us can’t remember what we ate for breakfast, we suspect most people will not remember, or will at least branch out, from their Visitas besties. Plus, there’s something about forced socialization in a sea of parents that may not lend itself to the creation of lifelong friendships.
Don’t get us wrong, Visitas can be a great opportunity to get a feel for Harvard, especially if you’re deciding between schools (but screw the California weather, we have Veritaffles). We’re just here to reassure those who can’t make it: Visitas is not that deep.

So, you got into Harvard: CONGRATS! Now, you’ve got Visitas to look forward to. It’s an ideal time for meeting other admitted and current Harvard students, attending lectures you probably won’t understand, signing up for too many email lists, and overall just getting to know Harvard. It’s only one weekend, but there’s so much to do. Here’s our advice on enjoying it, while also avoiding rescind-itas.
Make the Most of It
Make the most of this weekend. If you’re one of the “I’ve already followed and DM’ed the entirety of my class on Instagram” people, then this is your chance to meet everyone in real life. If you’re not as active on Instagram and Facebook, however, then this is your time to socialize and first meet the people that you’ll share your next four years with! Or, you could just roll solo all weekend and explore Harvard’s beautiful springtime campus.
Be Wary of Nighttime Partying
Don’t be the one prefrosh that sneaks in to a party and then doesn’t even know how to get back to your host’s dorm room. We know it’s only a weekend and it feels like it’s going to be such a long time before you’re on campus, but trust us. There will be many opportunities to go out with your friends when you’re a student here. There’s no need to rush. And there’s no need to possibly put yourself in a difficult situation for the sake of not missing out on a party.
Explore Your Interests!
Try to go to any and all events that interest you! Several of these events are organized by Harvard students specifically for Visitas, so it’s definitely a great time to set your sights on a club or organization that you may want to join come August. This is also a great time to meet people who share similar interests and hobbies as you! But remember, many events that are organized for Visitas are replicated to some extent during Opening Days, so don’t feel pressured to go to literally every single one.
NO ILLEGAL THINGS
Do not, do not, do NOT do anything illegal. Please, just don’t. Harvard’s Amnesty Policy does not extend to non-Harvard students (also known as prefrosh, also known as YOU). Avoid rescind-itas, and more importantly, look out for each other and make sure you’re being responsible with the choices you make.
In short, don’t let FOMO for the night turn into actually missing out on what could be an amazing college experience here. Hopefully Visitas is the first of many incredible weekends that you have on this campus. Just remember to be safe and responsible, and you’ll have a fun, wholesome Visitas! The (mild) debauchery can wait until after your enrollment.

Curious about how to navigate Visitas and what it means in the scheme of choosing your college? Hear from members of the student body, staff, faculty, and administration at Harvard to get different perspectives on this jam-packed weekend!
From Harvard Administrators
“If you got into Harvard you probably got into a lot of other great schools. You can’t make a bad decision so don’t lose too much sleep over this one. Talk to current students to learn about their experience. Then go with your gut (but come here!).”
— Lawrence S. Bacow, President of Harvard University
“We are so excited that you are here. While the College has a long and important history, I am most excited about the students who will determine our future. I hope you see yourself as part of that future during your visit to campus. As Dean of the College, I want to convey that while this campus is a special place, it is not perfect, and we don’t have all the answers. Nor should we. Instead, Harvard’s great strength as a campus and community comes from the fact that it is constantly changing and renewing as a result of the questions students ask and the solutions they advocate for every day.”
—Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Harvard College
“Greetings prospective Harvard College Students! Welcome to Visitas for the first of what I hope will be many opportunities for us to spend time together here at Harvard. Throughout the course of Visitas, I hope you will take advantage of some of the many academic and social events, and explore Harvard’s campus and surroundings. Most of all, I encourage you to look around and introduce yourself to current and prospective students.”
—Katherine G. O’Dair, Dean of Students
From the Staff
“Try anything. Go to an event describing something you’ve never heard of. Introduce yourself to someone you would never talk to. Try anything and capture the magic while it unfolds. And throw it back into the universe if you can.”
—Daniel M. Lobo ’14, Career Educator Fellow at the Office of Career Services and Member of First-Generation Alumni group
“Don’t just talk to presenters or the people who you’re staying with. While they’re wonderful resources, you might also want to strike up a conversation with other staff members you meet about why they work at Harvard and what they like about it!”
—Lena Denis, Harvard Map Collection Cartographic Assistant and First-Year Librarian
From A Current Student
“You've worked really hard to get to this point. Use Visitas as a time to unwind and explore the campus, either by yourself or with other prefrosh. Can you picture yourself as a Harvard student walking to class in the morning?”
—Joe A. Grochmal ’19, Senior in Leverett House concentrating in Government
From Faculty
“My classic tip for pre-Freshman during Visitas is to make sure they attend a few Harvard classes. Sniffing up the lecture hall atmosphere and getting a glimpse of the material and pace will help them form a better image of their future at our college.”
—Dr. Sien Verschave, Preceptor for Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology”
“Every student's experience at Harvard is different, so try to talk with a variety of current students about what they've found rewarding and challenging.”
—Janet Chen, Head Preceptor for Math 21a: “Multivariable Calculus” and Senior Preceptor in Mathematics
“I remember visiting Harvard, just before or after Visitas, staying with someone who'd gone to my high school. And on my way back to the dorm late that evening, I remember passing through Harvard Square, which was so brightly lit, with folks playing chess, of all things, outside of the now-Smith Center. I don't actually play chess, but that late-night vibrance was so new to me, having grown up in the suburbs. And that's what decided it for me. Harvard just seemed like such an exciting place to go to school.”
—David J. Malan ’99, Professor of the Practice of Computer Science and Course Head of CS50: “Introduction to Computer Science”
