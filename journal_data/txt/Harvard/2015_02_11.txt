After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Thursday morning in October. I’m on the sidewalk, in the rain. Instead of attending my math lecture, I’m waiting for even a glimpse of a cab so I can go meet with the manager of an Afghani restaurant somewhere in Porter Square. He seemed interested in buying an ad when we spoke on the phone, so I’m following the lead. It’s been only two months into my freshman year and, already, I have an unintended full time job: comping.
The comp can stand for completion or competency, as a way for new members to receive training in a particular area. But often, it becomes a grueling, time-consuming competition, with severe rounds of cuts and hazing. Throughout my first semester on campus, I’ve comped three different organizations. Two have been educational and pleasant, and the other, a source of stress, has taken up more time than most of my classes.
During those first few weeks of school, I began resenting this odd process. When my only goals were to try new things and make new friends, it was frustrating to realize that I couldn’t hop in and join any organization I liked. And I won’t lie, my resentment did increase throughout the semester, as I found myself missing lunch with friends to have meetings with potential caterers, compile mass mail-merge lists, and attend office hours for prospective groups. I feel like I’ve dealt with the worst of what the comp can be. But when I find myself looking back, I have surprisingly positive thoughts.
As students have argued, yes, it seems pretty ridiculous to force such talented, great people to prove their competency for various roles. Certainly, anyone here seems just as capable as the next. So why is the comp such a big part of the culture on campus? We’ve already proven ourselves by being here. Doesn’t it seem absurd to further convince one another of our competency?
In her piece criticizing this system, Reina A. E. Gattuso ’15, a Crimson magazine editor, states that the harsh treatment and intimidation compers feel is unnecessary and expresses a sentiment of exclusion and superiority. She says that instead, we should create spaces that welcome and empower, enabling people to think and work more freely. It’s clear that the demands of a comp can be ridiculous, and I think they can and do drive away valuable, passionate people. But while fostering a sense of community and freedom to participate on campus is undoubtedly important, the challenge that a comp poses, in its various capacities, is ultimately valuable. These processes teach us to work hard and ceaselessly for what we want and where we see ourselves, leading us to prioritize the areas in our lives that are personally important—an especially valuable skill in the life of a busy student.
As someone who, like many others, ended fall semester with both acceptances and rejections, I see the value in having this odd full-time job. It intimidated me, but it also motivated me to accomplish things I never thought I’d be able to do. In a competitive environment, where I often see students looking for “resume-padders” in activities and courses, I know that the comp ensures dedication and passion. No one in their right mind would spend hours calling various party bus companies in search of trade deals, if they weren’t passionate about the organization.
And that’s what I like about the comp: passionate people. I’ve made great friends throughout the semester with fellow compers enduring similar torture. Nothing fosters bonds you and your co-compers like sending out frantic group texts, devising plans together on how to close a vaporizer trade deal, or running around Boston together like crazed sales people. Three months ago, I had no idea how to sell ads, and I barely knew what a staff editorial was. Now, I can phone up companies until it can basically be called harassment, and I’ve written articles I’m proud of.
I’ve enjoyed a great first semester here. But it wouldn’t be ridiculous to say that I enjoyed being outside the classroom more, challenging myself and engaging with the world in a real, tangible way. And even if some comps didn’t necessary end in an acceptance, I still feel rewarded with a new skillset, and an intense motivation, and a (maybe twisted) desire to start it all again this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In high school I was basically the empress of interviews.
My senior spring was saturated with them. I had an inordinate amount of fun participating in scholarship interview weekends and hilariously staged “group discussions.” At some point I just started applying for scholarships with the secret hope that I would have the chance to sit in front of some adults and—in the words of two black goddesses—feel myself for about an hour.
The kind of self-indulgence necessary to outright enjoy interviews is wholly uncharacteristic of me. And, for the record, I’ve lost most of the interview mojo I had last spring.
Here, I’m learning, spring is the season of frenzying over summer opportunities. Another wave of interviews begins. I’m not sure where my interview confidence went, but I think I may know where it came from.
Before senior year there was one thing I could never really get on board with—interview clothes.
I’m not graceful. I have a lot of trouble walking in heels. I’m not tiny. A lot of “professional” looking dresses fit me in ways that are seen as unprofessional. And it’s damn hard to tame my hair into any weird configuration that is both acceptably demure and not painful.
At debate tournaments throughout high school I wore essentially the same outfit every weekend—a tight bun, a long pencil skirt, short heels, and a sweater. It was what I could afford and it was what fit me without making me look in any way like what the college counselors at my school would have called “suggestive” or “inappropriate.” It’s what I could get away with wearing. I couldn’t help but always think that the guys I debated against looked more comfortable, and more like they belonged.
Eventually I stopped worrying about getting away with things. I realized that I felt much more comfortable in a button down and a blazer. I started shopping for bowties. In turn I became more confident—and frankly way better looking—as a debater and interviewee. There isn’t anything particularly unique about this narrative of mine, but I think there may be something important behind it.
What I’m talking about is bro-appropriation. Bropropriation, if you will.
I was getting ready for an interview, remarking to my friends about how much like a “bro” I looked, when we all took a moment to consider what that meant. Soon, we all started talking about “Paris Is Burning.”
In this documentary about ball culture in 1980s New York, Dorian Corey remarks:
“Black people have a hard time getting anywhere, and those that do are usually straight. In a ballroom you can be anything you want. You're not really an executive but you're looking like an executive. You're showing the straight world that I can be an executive if I had the opportunity because I can look like one, and that is like a fulfillment.”
As a queer black woman, it is hard for me to walk around Harvard and pretend that I have always belonged here, or that I even do now. Of course, this isn’t the only place where this is true, but an interview in an old Harvard dining hall on a snowy New England day, all exposed brick and wood floors and monolithic mass of Bean Boots certainly exemplifies the idea. Here, even when I am wearing clothes that I think make me feel and look powerful, clothes that show that “I can be an executive if I have the opportunity,” there are gazes from tall white boys in clothes more expensive than mine that make it feel like I’m just playing dress up.
Interviewing involves both a literal and metaphorical putting on of clothes.
I think my high school interviewing confidence came from the fact that I had become very good at packaging myself, and eventually I realized how to literally package myself as well as I metaphorically did. I was a kid, I was sitting in front of wealthy, powerful adults, and I was saying, “I’m smart and I don’t have money. People like me have had a hard time getting anywhere. But look, I can be an executive if I have the opportunity.”
It’s not okay that there is a way for a woman to “dress like” a man, or for a not-straight person to dress like a straight person, to succeed. The concept of “dress like” shouldn't exist in the first place. But there is a certain power in looking at the rich, preppy white boy at the head of the room and instead of thinking about all of the barriers I have to get past that he doesn’t even know exist, rather to think, “I’m going to dress like him—no, like me. This way of dressing is not his anymore. I’m going to invade his country club and shake his hand as firm as the next guy.”
Maybe it’s just a cute outfit. Or maybe it’s a way to call into question symbols of power and privilege. Maybe appropriation has worked the other way around for long enough, and it’s time to turn the tables.
Or maybe belting a potato sack and looking better than designer is just self-empowerment at its simplest and finest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a meeting of the Committee on Undergraduate Education rekindled a longstanding student hope: that the administration would prohibit the scheduling of midterms on Housing Day.
The cause was championed strongly at the meeting by Undergraduate Council Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16. Goyal and UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 had campaigned last fall on a platform that emphasized ending Housing Day exams. In particular, Goyal reminded the committee members of the stress that faces students with the combination of both assessments and housing lottery results, while also noting that immediate change would be improbable, if not impossible, given the disarray caused by three snow days.
Goyal is right to criticize the inconvenience of the current system. Traditionally held on the last Thursday before spring break, Housing Day coincides with a high tide of papers and midterms, especially as some professors attempt to squeeze in one extra assignment before the week off. As a result, students must navigate between studying and engaging with their House communities.
It is shortsighted to dismiss the push to reschedule midterms by arguing that academics come first. The sort of community fostered by Housing Day is a vital component of any Harvard education. While the festivities can occasionally bear more than a passing resemblance to a college-wide bacchanalia, they are also a unique opportunity to build cohesion within each House—a goal that the Office of Admissions loves to advertise.
Certainly, record-breaking snowfalls over the past few weeks have complicated plans to reconfigure Housing Day for this semester. It is impractical to ask professors to throw out schedules that they have already erased and rewritten; their job here is not to repeatedly revise and create new iterations of course schedules. Pushing to abolish midterms on the Thursday before Spring Break this year would be an unwise and disrespectful decision.
However, this does not mean that status quo is the only remaining option; the administration should seriously consider other alternatives that would enable a meaningful Housing Day for all students. Instead of moving house activities to Friday, which Goyal has suggested, the optimal policy would be to reschedule the celebration for a nearby Saturday, when there is no conflict between academic and communal commitments. Further, as this weekend option would not inconvenience professors, there are fewer logistical barriers preventing the administration from implementing such a plan as early as this year.
If placing Housing Day on a Saturday in March would cause problems, then the administration should consider moving the celebration either earlier or later in the calendar. The original date of Housing Day was chosen so as not to interfere with the day when freshmen declared their concentrations; given that first-years no longer have this responsibility during the second semester, the placement of Housing Day in March has now lost its earlier purpose.
The conflict between missing midterms and missing out is not only unfair but also unnecessary. Starting this year, the administration should pledge to ensuring that students are not forced to choose between good grades and community spirit.

Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87, Cambridge’s assistant city manager for community development and a former city council member passed away suddenly on Thursday. He was 50.
Murphy, a Boston native, attended Roxbury Latin High School before graduating from Harvard College and going on to receive a law degree at the University of Chicago Law School.
Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher praised Murphy’s distinct sense of humor and loving spirit.
“He was [a] very intelligent, quick-witted, funny guy who was always able to bring a smile to people’s faces and was someone who deeply, deeply cared about the Cambridge community,” Maher said.
“He called himself a pragmatic progressive,” Maher added. “I think he just truly fit that title. He was somebody who always tried to work toward solving problems. There was an innate ability for him to listen to people.”
Murphy’s tenure in Cambridge city government began when he was first elected as a city council member in 2001, beginning a seven-year track that earned him the respect and admiration of his peers. Murphy left Cambridge politics to serve for two years as the deputy secretary for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation before settling back down as the assistant city manager for community development in 2011.
Colleagues admired Murphy’s work ethic and unparalleled dedication to various positions through the years.
“[Murphy] was on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi said. “He was a tireless worker. He had great collaboration skills, great foresight, [and] thought a lot about the community on a lot of levels.”
Ellen Semonoff, the assistant city manager of human services, said Murphy “humanized” his work in an effort to benefit the citizens of Cambridge.
“He had a very broad view and inclusive view of [who] needed to be involved in planning and of how planning needed to enrich the community,” Semenoff said.
Rossi said Murphy will also be remembered for his well-balanced life and commitment to family.
“He’s truly one of the great examples that you’d ever want to find of somebody who was totally dedicated to his wife and children and extended family,” Rossi said.
Murphy leaves behind his wife Katherine and two children, Molly and Joseph. Visiting hours are being held in his honor at Cambridge City Hall Wednesday from 3 to 7 p.m., with a funeral mass to follow on Thursday at 10 a.m. in St. Paul's Church.
City Council member E. Denise Simmons wrote in an email that Murphy will be remembered by all those who were fortunate to cross his path.
“Brian Murphy impacted so many people, he gained so many admirers, and he made so many friends through the work he did and the way he carried himself,” Simmons wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a double snow day prompted the College and many other Harvard schools to cancel classes for the third time this semester, administrators are wondering how to make up for lost instructional time.
In an email sent to all College students Tuesday afternoon, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called on them to be flexible with their schedules to fit in make-up classes. “I’m writing to enlist your help as we work with course instructors to schedule make-up lectures, seminars, and sections for those that could not be held due to the weather,” he wrote.
Harris provided several ideas for making up coursework, suggesting that individual professors and their students work to find mutually convenient times on a class-by-class basis.
“Some possibilities include evenings, extended classes, and holding make-up classes on Fridays, when few regularly-scheduled courses meet,” he wrote in the email.
Some professors, however, had classes affected by multiple school closings and are finding it challenging to work around the lost time.
“Between the storm the first week of classes and this one, I’ve lost at least three class sessions,” philosophy professor Edward J. Hall said.
Hall said he plans to poll his students to find a make-up time that works best. “Probably what I’ll end up doing is having two evening sections that are optional but encouraged,” he said.
Although Harris wrote that professors should “do our best to hold make-up classes during the instructional term rather than Reading Period,” he also wrote that “in some cases this will not be possible, and some classes will have to meet during Reading Period.”
Harris could not be reached for comment.

Harvard’s four sororities collectively accepted 215 women this year, marking yet more growth in the budding Greek system.
Tuesday’s “bid day”—when participants receive bids, or acceptance offers, from sororities—marked the conclusion of this year’s new shortened rush process, for which a record 280 women registered. The number of bids extended this year is also the highest yet, marking an increase from the 174 offered in 2013 and roughly 150 offered last year.
According to Ting-Ting H. Liu ’15, president of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, each of the four sororities—Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta—accepted at least 51 new members on Tuesday. The sororities’ collective retention rate was 77.9 percent, as 276 women actually participated in rush, according to Liu.
Leah C. Goldman ’15, vice president of recruitment for the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, said retention of women throughout the process was particularly high this year and that many of those who did not receive bids had voluntarily dropped out.
Liu said she thought rush went “really smoothly in terms of logistics” this year despite the snowstorm that hit New England and prompted Harvard to suspend most operations for two days.
“It was a little harder with the snow, but I think it was so well-organized that overall it went without any road bumps,” Liu said, adding that the only change organizers made because of the snow was to move bid day, originally set for 8 a.m. Tuesday morning, to Tuesday afternoon.
At bid day Tuesday afternoon, prospective new members tore into envelopes containing their invitations to join one of the sororities, screams and chants filling the Sheraton Commander Hotel George Washington Ballroom as they ran to join their peers.
Alina G. Munoz ’18, one of the women who rushed, milled around with friends as she waited with letter in hand. While she recalled having to avoid stepping in puddles in full make-up and a dress while passers-by stared as she walked to a rush event, Munoz said she overall had a fun experience and was looking forward to celebrating on Tuesday night with her new chapter. As in previous years, each sorority hosted a welcome event for their new members.
Goldman said sorority leaders will decide in the coming weeks whether to keep continue the shortened rush, but said she thought the schedule changes had been well-received.

After the Cambridge City Council passed several amendments to the city’s Tobacco Ordinance last month, raising the tobacco purchase age to 21, tobacco business owners said they thought the new amendments would hurt sales, though not to the point of forcing businesses to close down.
The controversial new amendments take effect in June; city officials will use the interim time to inform business owners of the new rules. Besides restricting the sale of tobacco, the amendments limit the use of e-cigarettes and cut down on public spaces where people can smoke.
Najeeb Hussain, who owns Tommy’s Value on Mt. Auburn St., estimated his tobacco sales would decrease by up to 15 to 20 percent. Hussain said that while the store does not profit much from tobacco sales due to heavy taxes, Tommy’s Value continues to sell cigarettes to draw tobacco customers who buy other incidental goods.
At Leavitt & Peirce on Massachusetts Ave., a retail store that specializes in roll-your-own tobacco, owner Paul J. MacDonald said the new amendments would hurt “a lot,” but would not drive his business under. The new amendments will ban the sale of flavored tobacco from most stores, but maintain an exception for tobacco retail stores.
MacDonald said that, because the age increase is Cambridge-specific, consumers will go to other towns or buy online.
“More business lost to [small businesses],’” he wrote in a follow-up email. “Yes, we will survive. It just will be a bit harder.”
Owners and employees of convenience stores in the Square, like Crimson Corner and Out of Town News, said they do not expect heavy losses due to the new amendments.
Dharma Kafle, who works at Out of Town News, said that he estimated more than 100 students bought tobacco there a day, with the number of buyers peaking during the summer.
Many business people said they heard about the amendments only after they were passed. Few business leaders showed up to the multiple public hearings the Cambridge City Council held to discuss the issue, according to Councilor Marc C. McGovern.
Sami Herbawi, who owns Andala Coffee House on Franklin Street, was one of the few business people to speak out publicly at the hearings, McGovern said. Herbawi petitioned that restaurants like his be allowed to keep outdoor hookah smoking, which he said is both a cultural tradition and a primary draw for his business.
His petition was granted, McGovern said. Restaurants received an exception that hookah and water pipe use may be permitted in outdoor seating other than on public sidewalk seating areas.
Hussain, who had not heard of the amendments until The Crimson contacted him, said that he was disappointed the city had not reached out directly to ask for feedback. As someone who quit a smoking habit, he said he supports the amendments, but doubts they will alter smoking rates.
Sam Lipson of the Cambridge Public Health Department said that the public events were widely publicized. The amendments, Lipson said, were attempts to counter the tobacco industry’s strategies to capture younger smokers, and were not “primarily being driven by economic issues.”
“This has been a four-year process; we’ve had four full hearings in a public setting,” Lipson said. “This has gotten more review time than I think any community in the state that’s made these kind of changes.”

UPDATED: February 11, 2015, at 1:45 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust said on Tuesday that Harvard will not help the Boston 2024 Olympic bid with fundraising even though some of the bid’s correspondence has publicly entertained that possibility.
“We would not divert fundraising to the Olympics, and we would not share names of donors who are confidential and part of Harvard’s community,” Faust said in her first sit-down interview of 2015 with The Crimson. “We would not share those beyond our own community.”
Faust said that she did not see the bid documents before they were released and that all plans are in preliminary stages.
But Boston 2024's budget proposal, dated Dec. 1, 2014, suggested a fundraising partnership.
“We intend to capitalize on this momentum and strong base of support to diversify our funding sources and continue to secure leadership level gifts,” it read. “We also look forward to collaborating with our college and university partners in this bid, whose established fundraising programs have created endowments that are among the largest in the country," including Harvard and MIT's.
The value of Harvard’s endowment at the end of fiscal year 2014 was listed last month as $35.9 billion.
On Tuesday, Faust emphasized that Harvard will not make concessions to accommodate the Olympic bid.
“We will follow certain principles as we engage around the question of what the Olympics might be in 2024 and those include a fundamental commitment and priority of our academic mission and of our institutional program,” Faust said in the interview, which was also attended by University spokesperson Jeff Neal. “We will not make any compromises in resources that would be allocated to those.”
She added that Harvard would encourage individuals who are interested in volunteering or participating in the organization of the Olympics.
Harvard could host up to 10 events in the 2024 games if the International Olympic Committee selects Boston as the host city. Under preliminary plans in the bid documents, field hockey would be held at Harvard Stadium, and the Albert H. Gordon Track and Tennis Center would host fencing. Overlays would be constructed in both venues to accommodate Olympic traffic.
The committee also plans to hold aquatics and tennis events at temporary venues that would be built specifically for the games on Harvard’s property in Allston.

After weeks of dangerous weather conditions, leaders of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers said that they will push for greater opportunities for their members to work from home in upcoming labor negotiations with the University.
The University has significantly curtailed operations three times in the past 17 days due to inclement weather, requiring only “critical personnel” to report to work. Roughly 95 percent of the union’s members—who work in positions ranging from police dispatchers to office assistants—are considered “non-critical personnel."
However, HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said that travel on many regular work days has still been difficult because most members of the union deal with commutes that normally range from a half-an-hour to an hour each way.
According to Jaeger, even when the University is open, the current agreement between HUCTW and the University states that that if it is significantly unsafe to travel or if conditions are too hazardous, employees are giving the option of discussing potential options with their supervisors, including taking a personal day or working from home.
“We are hearing far too many of our members who are doing staff office jobs say that their managers are not allowing them to work from home on days with hazardous commuting conditions,” Jaeger said.
“There are a lot of members of our union who would like to have enough of the support and trust of their supervisors to do parts of their jobs from home when the traveling is pretty difficult,” Jaeger said. “There is some of that support and trust that is missing and we really want to try and gain that for our union members in the coming negotiations.”
In anticipation of the upcoming round of labor negotiations, which are expected to begin this spring, Carrie Barbash, a union organizer at HUCTW, reiterated the union’s commitment to working on behalf of its members for maximum flexibility in their work environment.
“The technology that we have now could allow members to work from home and would not only improve their quality of life and give them more flexibility, but also improve their level of productivity in their jobs.” Barbash said. “I think that depending on their position, members should be able to come in when it makes sense to come and stay at home when it makes sense to stay home.”
In an email sent Tuesday evening, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote, “Harvard looks forward to working with HUCTW on a host of issues when we begin the process of negotiating the new contract.”

A snow blower, some drywall, and a trip to Cuba.
This is how Astronomy Professor Robert P. Kirshner ’70, recipient of the 2015 Wolf Prize, has decided to spend his prize money. The snow blower for obvious reasons, drywall to fix up the third floor of his house in Maine, and the trip to Cuba as part tropical break from Cambridge, part homage to Ricardo Wolf, the namesake of the award that Kirshner received at the end of January.
The Wolf Prize, according to its website, is awarded to those responsible for “achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among people.” Kirshner won this accolade for his work using supernovae to measure distances between stars, proving that the universe is growing at an increasing rate, not a decreasing one, as had previously been thought.
Since the 1930s, it has been established that the universe is expanding. Most took for granted that, as time progressed, the expansion of the universe would slow down as the forces of gravity pulled bodies toward each other. As a member of the High-Z Supernova Search Team, Kirshner set out to discover the universe’s expansion rate. To this end, his team investigated supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of collapsing stars. Kirshner used the differing brightness of supernovae to determine the distance between galaxies, based on the principle that the closer a star is, the brighter it will appear.
After making their measurements, Kirshner’s team found that rather than decelerating, the universe’s growth was, in fact, accelerating. The discovery was named Science magazine’s 1998 “Breakthrough of the Year” and has ultimately led to the study of dark matter, the energy presumed to be counteracting gravity to push the universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate.
The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Kirshner’s graduate students Adam G. Riess and Brian P. Schmidt as well as Saul Perlmutter ’81, a physicist from the University of California, Berkeley who led a parallel team investigating the expansion of the universe. The Nobel Prize has a stipulation that the prize can be awarded to three people at the most. This year’s Wolf Prize celebrates Kirshner’s contributions to the High-Z Supernova Search Team and the field of supernova cosmology, both in an advising and research capacity.
For years, Kirshner has taught broader audiences about his findings through general education classes on these topics, including “The Energetic Universe” this semester.
“I think the fact that  instruction is as good as it is in the College depends on the fact that people who are really good at what they do really care about it and want to tell people about it,” Kirshner said.
Kirshner’s discoveries have even permeated popular culture.  Kirshner’s daughter, a former writer for the hit TV show Gilmore Girls, wrote him into the show on the sly during an episode set at Yale parents weekend. In the episode, the characters decide to attend a lecture on the accelerating universe by Professor Quincy, in reference to Quincy House, where Kirshner lived as an undergraduate and served as housemaster from 2001-2007.
“I was even going to act [in the show] but we couldn’t get the screen actor’s guild to sign off fast enough,” said Kirshner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has had seven snow days in the last 37 years, three of which fell in the past two weeks. Top administrators said on Tuesday the decision to shutter operations is a tough call that heavily focuses on road conditions and the availability of public transportation.
On Monday and Tuesday the University closed down operations and only critical personnel worked. On Jan. 27, the Harvard closed for winter storm “Juno”.
“I think that people overall appreciate and know how difficult these decisions are,” University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said. “Some people may disagree with the decision. Some people might have thought we should have stayed open today or we should have closed last week. This is an art, not a science.”
Lapp said that before she came to Harvard, the University’s procedures surrounding closures were not very well formed or centralized. Now, she said a crisis management team of around 30 school deans, Harvard University Health Services officials, central administrators, library representatives, the chief of police from Harvard University Police Department, and University spokesperson Jeff Neal have a conference call between 24 and 48 hours before an impending storm to discuss the University’s response.
Lapp said that they generally have two to three conference calls to determine whether or not to cancel non-critical operations. For Tuesday, Lapp said that MBTA’s decision to close operations played largely into the University’s closure.
“Well over a majority of our employees—staff and faculty—come in on public transportation,” Lapp said. “That was a real game-changer for folks.”
Meredith Weenick ’90, the University’s vice president for campus services, said that a team of more than 100 employees work along with contractors to remove snow. Weenick and Lapp said that the costs associated with snow removal don’t ever come into play for a decision to close the University.
“[Cost] doesn’t factor in at all,” Lapp said in an interview, which was also attended by Neal. “Safety and security of our students, faculty, and staff are paramount, and we take that very seriously. Whether we stay open or stay closed, we reinforce that message.”
The recent closures has caused unusual interruptions in class schedules.  Some instructors may hold make up classes during the evening, through virtual platforms such as Skype, or during Fridays, when many classes don’t typically meet, Dean of Undergraduate Education Harvard College Jay M. Harris wrote in an email.
Historically, it has taken major weather events to prompt a University closure. In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” Harvard closed in 2013 for winter storm “Nemo,” in 2012 for Hurricane Sandy, and in 1978 for three days for a blizzard. Unrelated to weather, the University closed in 2013 because of the manhunt for the alleged Boston Marathon bombers.

A team of astronomers, including a Harvard-affiliated scientist, detected bubbles in a supernova, the explosion of a massive star, that may hold clues to the asymmetry of stellar explosions.
Astronomers Dan Milisavljevic of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Rob A. Fesen of Dartmouth College produced a three-dimensional map of the bubbly interior of the remnants of one such stellar explosion, Cassiopeia A (Cas A), that took place in the constellation Cassiopeia approximately 340 years ago.
Each star has a spherically layered structure at the time of explosion, with the heaviest elements such as iron closest to the center. Scientists had previously believed that explosions would not alter this arrangement of elements. In 1987, however, high-energy emissions originating from radioactive nickel were detected from a nearby supernova. Astronomers found that  nickel, a heavy element, had somehow sped past the lighter elements, overturning the theory of spherically symmetric explosions.
Milisavljevic and Fesen observed approximately half a dozen enormous cavities, or bubbles, inside the remains of Cas A using near-infrared wavelengths of light to penetrate the dust surrounding the former star.
They believe that the bubbles that they found uphold the hypothesis that supernovae are asymmetrical.
“The nickel radioactively decays to cobalt and emits high energy photons that produce a pressure that expands the blobs into the surrounding gas,” Milisavljevic wrote in an emailed statement. “It is this process – most important during the first couple weeks of the explosion – that carves out cavities or ‘bubbles.’”
To prove their claim, Milisavljevic and Fesen are now searching for iron deposits in the bubbles. The products of radioactive nickel decay, iron deposits would signal nickel’s activity in supernovae and the formation of bubbles.
“We have provided a map of what the end state of the explosion looks like,” Milisavljevic wrote. “Now using sophisticated simulations being run on some of the world’s most powerful computers, they can attempt to trace back how the explosion took place.”
This study may serve as a starting point in the search for the origin of asymmetry in supernovae, Milisavljevic and Fesen said.
“This is a fundamental process in the universe that produces the raw materials that make life possible. We should know a thing or two about how this happens!”

For Philip Kim, nanoscience is a very big deal.
“These are really big picture questions we’re trying to answer here,” said Kim, Professor of Physics and Applied Physics. “How do things behave when they become tiny? How does the quantum physics play a role when we’re looking at very small objects?”
Kim, who joined the faculty this school year after 14 years of teaching and researching at Columbia University, studies physical phenomena in nanoscale materials. Since he made the decision to return to Harvard, where he received his Ph.D. in physics, Kim has been physically building his lab in the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering. With a newly assembled team of researchers, Kim has constructed the equipment and facilities comprising his lab.
“In this lab, he builds tiny little devices and then he makes measurements on those materials, which require rather special conditions,” said Masahiro Morii, Professor of Physics and Chair of the Physics Department. “All these things require sophisticated equipment that you can’t just go out and buy, so he has to build that equipment himself.”
An experimental condensed matter physicist, Kim focuses on technologies at an atomic scale. He studies tiny material systems to detect and test new phenomena that arise only at this minute, “mesoscopic” level of investigation. The equipment Kim requires ranges from cryostats, high-powered refrigerating chambers, to superconducting magnets 300,000 times the strength of Earth’s magnetic field.
“Certain instruments require specific electrical and plumbing conditions,” Kim said. “I’m building new instrumentation that requires tight spaces and controls, since I’m synthesizing and building low-dimensional materials.”
To transport his lab from New York to its new Cambridge home, Kim had to carefully disassemble, ship, and reassemble his apparatuses. According to Jesse Crossno, one of the graduate students working in Kim’s lab, this assembly process is fairly standard in the applied physics community.
“Most of us end up building our own projects in grad school,” Crossno said. “The way Philip runs his lab is great because he gives us guidance and suggests areas of interest, but he really lets us construct our own thesis.”
In addition to building his lab’s instrumentation, Kim also mandated the reconstruction of his lab’s physical design.
“I wanted to create more of an interactive space,” Kim said.
To this end, Kim installed glass walls, covered with the rainbow scrawls of equations and sketches. This design choice seems to borrow from companies in Silicon Valley, an industry Kim aspires to partner with one day. Electronic applications of physics principles have driven the growth of silicon-powered technologies, Kim said. If Kim discovers an alternative material system to silicon, which forms the basis of most technologies today, his research could open up a host of new nanotechnological capabilities that existing silicon devices do not allow.
“The hope is we want to find new material platforms and new physical phenomena that can be useful to build up future electronics,” Kim said. “It’s an ambitious goal, and I’m not sure we can really realize it, but we should find a lot of interesting science on the way.”

To stay on the cutting edge of data analysis, Harvard researchers, from neurobiologists to climate scientists, are turning to Homer.
Assistant Dean for Research Computing James Cuff developed Odyssey, a centralized, high-computing system, when he arrived at Harvard in 2006, and scientists at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital are using the computing environment to process big data in their research, as computing sciences continue to figure prominently into medicine.
“In the style of one of the ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer, it was a journey!” Cuff wrote in an email. “The administration, senior faculty, and the deans each realized that without high quality research computing, Harvard wouldn't maintain their national and global competitiveness.”
The Research Computing cluster at Harvard, which was founded in 2007, offers computational resources for bioinformatic analysis, visualization, and data storage and currently serves 1215 active user accounts at three data centers.
Randy L. Buckner, a Harvard psychology and neuroscience professor and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, uses Odyssey to study human brain function in his lab.
“I think that one of the reasons why research computing and the Odyssey cluster is so important it that we’re just dealing with extraordinary amounts of data about individual brains, about large numbers of individuals, and even brain states over time,” Buckner said. “And to make sense of that complexity we need this level of computing horsepower.”
According to John D.E. Gabrieli, a professor of health sciences and technology and cognitive neuroscience at MIT, computational resources offer especially great insight into the brain and various neurological disorders, based on the brain’s inherent complexity.
“The Odyssey program at Harvard is invaluable in supporting the scientific needs of understanding the amazing computational powers of the brain, from neurons to large-scale networks,” Gabrieli wrote in an email.
While computer programs offer several advantages in processing big data, Buckner acknowledged concerns over security and data protection inherent in computing research as well.
“We’ve seen across the life sciences and medical fields in general appropriate concerns about privacy and medical records,” Buckner said. “Research computing that is working with human data, whether it be economics or medicine, is going to need to confront those challenges.”

The championship of the 37th annual Women’s Beanpot was a battle of top-ranked teams. Boston College, which entered the game atop Hockey East and the NCAA national rankings, travelled across town to take on ECAC-leading Harvard to see which Beantown team deserved the city crown.
This was not the first time this season that the crosstown rivals had met. Earlier in the season, the Eagles (27-1-1, 18-0-0 Hockey East) beat Harvard (19-4-2, 14-3-1 ECAC) handily, 10-2, on Nov. 18.
This time, it was the No. 4/4 Crimson who outplayed the Eagles, handing the previously undefeated team its first loss, 3-2, to take the crown as Beanpot champions. This is the first time since the 2010 season that the women have taken home the title.
“There are so many reasons why this [win] is huge,” junior forward Miye D’Oench said. “First of all, it was probably our worst game when we played them at the beginning of the season, and coming back to win today was huge for us. Obviously, beating an undefeated team proves to everyone else and ourselves that we can go all the way.”
Within the first two minutes of play, the Eagles struck from the left, taking a shot that deflected off a stick past Harvard goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
After the opening goal, BC handled the puck for most of the opening minutes of play, taking a stab at the Crimson goal 13 times during the first period. In comparison, Harvard had only four shots on goal in the opening 20 minutes of play. The Eagles continued to outshoot the Crimson for the remainder of the game, ending the night with 32 shots on goal compared to Harvard’s 17.
At the 9:08 mark of the first period, the Crimson broke through onto the scoreboard when freshman forward Karly Heffernan shoveled a pass out to classmate Lexie Laing, who was waiting in front of the goal and took one shot that ricocheted off the pad of Eagle goalie Katie Burt. Junior forward Mary Parker picked up the rebound, finding the back of the BC goal to net her 13th goal of the season.
The Eagles opened up a scoring opportunity at the 12:44 mark of the first period when senior forward Kalley Armstrong was penalized for slashing, but BC could not capitalize on the woman-up advantage.
The power play proved to be the difference in the game, as D’Oench’s goal at 11:54 in the second period went on to seal the Crimson victory. With Harvard having the 4-on-3 advantage, a battle in front of the BC net resulted in D’Oench taking a rebound shot off the pads of Burt and scoring the team’s third and final goal of the night.
“Our power play has been successful recently and we wanted to continue that,” D’Oench said. “[Senior forward] Sarah Edney took a great shot and missed the net. There was kind of a scrum in front of the net, and somehow someone popped it over to my stick and I put it in the net.”
Leading up to that goal, the second period began in a 1-1 tie.
The Eagles, however, broke the tie at 8:18 when junior forward Haley Skarupa muscled a shot past the right glove of Maschmeyer, putting BC back into the driver’s seat.
The control did not last long. Shooting the puck out of the corner, Parker shoveled a pass in front of the goal to Heffernan whose slapshot found the back of the Eagle goal. Less than two minutes later, D’Oench struck with her 14th goal of the season.
“I think one of the big turning points for us was when BC scored their second goal,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I think it really woke us up and ticked us off a little bit, and we were a different hockey team after that than we were in the beginning. I thought we played really well after that. We turned around and answered quickly. We had a fire and we were on our toes.”
In the closing minute of the game, BC took three shots that came extremely close to getting past Maschmeyer, but the junior stood her ground. Maschmeyer’s performance earned her the title of top goalie throughout the Beanpot along with tournament MVP. Over the course of the tournament, Maschmeyer had a .927 save percentage, while allowing three goals in the two games.
“It doesn’t matter who I’m going up against,” Maschmeyer said. “For me I look across the ice and say I’m going to win this battle, and I just have to outplay the other goalie to win. As a goalie, I just have to think about saving the next shot and focusing on the battle of each play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Tuesday’s contest against Trinity, the Harvard men’s squash team looked to carry the momentum of an undisputed Ivy League championship, secured last weekend with victories over Brown and archrival Yale, into another big win.
But the Bantams had other plans for their stay in Cambridge.
After over a foot of snow postponed the match originally scheduled for Jan. 28, No. 1 Trinity (16-1) wouldn’t allow the inclement weather to stand in the way again as top-ranked squash powers clashed Tuesday at the Murr Center. The Bantams took down the defending national champion Crimson (8-3, 7-0 Ivy), 6-3.
“It was a very nice match,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “We love playing Trinity. It was a good hard clean match against a strong team. The best team won.”
Down 4-3 with two matches left, the No. 3 Crimson was ultimately unable to recreate its season-defining win from last year’s campaign. The Bantams left little doubt about the result of the match as their final two players got off to a quick start, with junior Juan Vargas taking what turned out to be the clinching match, 3-0.
With the Crimson trailing 4-2, the team’s top player, freshman Madhav Dhingra, kept hopes alive after fighting back from down 2-1 to the Bantam’s No. 1 seed senior Vrishab Kotian. After some lively discourse with the referee in the fourth game, Dhingra didn’t look back, and closed out the final two games for the Crimson.
The result on its own was not enough to carry the Crimson to victory for the second straight season over the Bantams, as Trinity’s lower four seeds swept Harvard’s. None of these matches were decided in straight games, however, with one even extending into five games. Even the inconsequential final match of the game ended in a 3-1 victory for Trinity’s Moustafa Hamada over Harvard junior Matt Roberts.
The other players notching victory for Harvard came from two freshmen, Bradley Smith and David Ryan, at the third and fifth spots, respectively. No upperclassmen were able to secure points for Harvard on the night.
Sophomore Dylan Murray’s 3-0 defeat was closer than it appeared, however, as his opponent needed extra points to overcome him in two of the three games, with the third game reaching 15-14 before Miled Zarazua won the final point to get his squad one game closer to victory.
Harvard was unable to bounce back from the deficit. Co-captain Tyler Olson narrowly lost his effort in five games, and sophomore Devin McLoughlin fell in the same fashion.
The Crimson’s seven-game win streak wasn’t the only one to be broken on the night. Olson was dealt his first loss of the season, after having gone 9-0 on the season thus far. The effort to maintain his team-best record was made in earnest, as he went down narrowly, 3-2.
Trinity had momentum of its own, coming off of a NESCAC conference championship over the weekend and riding a five-game win streak to Cambridge.
“The takeaway will be in the mental adjustment for those that lost,” Way said. “We’re a very young team. [I’m] very proud of our lads having just won the Ivy League Title. We were the underdogs here, and we came very, very close. We know what we’re up against, and we know what we’ve got to do.”
After winning the first 26 matches between the two schools, the Crimson has recently been on a slide against the Bantams. Trinity has now won 25 of the last 29 meetings.
“We had Yale on Friday [and] Brown on Sunday,” Dinghra said. “It was really heavy match over-load…. Everyday you can’t expect to play your best squash. Its good to see our team coming together fighting. We just need a little extra push, and we should be good for nationals.”

Throughout its history, the oh so prestigious Harvard University seems to have tried to prove something to its students and to the world: that the Big H turns down for nothing– not even snow days. Somehow, apparently, I feel like the administration thinks that Harvard will seem more superior if its students are forced to trudge through three feet of snow and 20022020 MPH wind to get to their 9 a.m. classes. (sidenote: THIS IS SO UNTRUE. WHEN WE HAD SCHOOL IN THE BLIZZARD LAST WEEK, ALL I LEARNED WAS THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO FALL INTO LIKE TEN SNOWBANKS IN FIVE HOURS AND I ENDED UP FREEZING IN CLASS AND I WAS TOO DISTRACTED BY THE COLD ALL CLASS AND I COULDN’T LEARN ANYTHING OTHER THAN HOW COLD I WAS.)
Anyways, in the past three weeks, we’ve had three snow days, basically just as many as Harvard University has announced since the Blizzard of ‘78. I’m sure everyone has their own interpretation as to why we’ve been lucky enough to have had so many snow days (let alone any snow days) in such a short amount of time, but I’m here to tell you the real reason: me.
So before you go thanking the brutal New England weather, find ya girl and give her a hug because I am the snow day good luck charm hero that Harvard needs and deserves. If you aren’t yet convinced solely because of my extremely good looks and charm, I guess I can give you a few reasons to prove why we have had three snow days in three weeks because of me.
1) 1/26/15: Australia DayOur first snow day of my Harvard career was “conveniently” the day after Australia Day was celebrated in the beautiful, outstanding, flawless United States of America. Of course I was going to celebrate Australia Day when I should have been finalizing my classes. Not only is one of my best friends straight out of Aussie, but also I love nothing more than celebrating in the best colors ever aka red, white, and blue. So, of course, no surprise at all, as my friends and I were celebrating whatever Australia celebrates on Australia Day, we got that good good text from the College telling us school would be canceled the next day. Well, of course. How else did Drew Faust expect me to get from the Quad to my room on Australia Night if she also expected me to attend class the next morning? Of course, she knew this was impossible, especially since my best friend, Uber, was not allowed to be on the streets.


2) 2/9/15: OEB Makeup Final at 9 a.m.No, I still have not taken my finals from last semester. Because shout out to whomever landed on my head when everyone stormed the field at H-Y and gave me a concussion. It was the day before my OEB makeup final and I was on Chapter 4 of 36 and so I began praying. At about 7 p.m., I found out that I had been praying to the one and only Stephen Lassonde (thanks for those dope emails about snow days and continuing to use the phrase “critical personnel”). He even bolded in his snow day email that FINALS WOULD BE POSTPONED (I’m going to take that as a personal s/o to me).
3.) 2/10/15: Linguistics Makeup Final at 2 p.m.You already know the deal. Stephen Lassonde answered my prayers once more. He absolutely received the vibes I sent him. I sent him vibes that I had been so preoccupied with studying for my Monday exam that I had no time yet to consider my next makeup final. So, he decided that I deserved another snow day. He realized, “Why make Betty stressed to the max during her sophomore spring when some unidentified large male at Harvard-Yale decided that her big Irish head was a good landing spot in spite of the entire span of the football field?” So, that is how snow day number 3 of 2015 was decided.
If you would like to challenge my thoroughly analyzed data and computations, hmu. Until then, before you question how/why Harvard has had so many more snow days in this short semester than it ever has in history, remember that ya girl has you covered.

Happy Wednesday, Harvard! We hope you enjoyed your 4 day weekend. Hypothetically, all these snow days should’ve given you the time to finish the work you’ve been neglecting since shopping week, but no one actually thinks college students are really using their days off for work. At least you won’t be the only one that shows up to your section claiming ‘I thought we were going to have another snow day’ as the reason you haven’t done any of the readings.
Today’s forecast calls for single-digit windchill (boo). On the upside, it shouldn’t be snowing, so at least the wind won’t be blowing snow into your face when you have to brave the cold.
Lunch:
Popcorn Chicken
Green Garbanzo Falafel Sandwich
Spicy Potato Pierogies
Dinner:
Beef Meatballs in Marinara Sauce
Memphis Style Roasted Chicken
