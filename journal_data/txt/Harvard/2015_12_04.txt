After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the release last May of a report that deemed Harvard College’s Program in General Education “failing on a variety of fronts,” there has been broad consensus among students and faculty of the need for reform: Gen Ed's requirements are too restrictive, and many of the courses are simply lacking in quality. They faculty are right to complain about Gen Ed in its current form. But the solution they've proposed to fix the program is all wrong.
This week, faculty members were presented with a three-pronged proposal for the future of General Education. The new proposal would require students to take a total of eight courses: One course from each of four new General Education subgroups, one course in each of the three divisions of the Faculty of Arts of Sciences, and one quantitative course. The proposal was met with overwhelming praise at the semester’s last meeting of FAS professors; a vote on the plan is likely in the spring.
At the core of this proposal is the University administration’s steadfast refusal to realize the flaws of the current Program in General Education. The faculty proposal assumes that the program is failing due to poor organization of requirements. Yet General Education’s failing are far more deep-rooted, as we have said before. Too many classes should but do not count toward the requirements. All too common is the mathematics concentrator who still needs to fulfill Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning or the philosophy concentrator yet to complete the Ethical Reasoning requirement. The limited selection within subfields often leads students to see General Education courses as a constraint to their education, rather than an enhancement—a key problem that the proposal entirely fails to address.
Moreover, the proposal put forth by the review committee presents an overly complex solution that is symptomatic of the bureaucratization of higher education, both nationwide and here at Harvard. The “three prongs” of the proposal adds a layer of inaccessibility and confusion to the Program in General Education that previously did not exist—finding classes to fulfill the myriad requirements promises to be even more difficult than it already is. The philosophical underpinnings meant to serve a justification for the program are insufficient to validate the its complexity.
We have previously suggested that the College move towards a system of distribution requirements. We maintain that belief. Such a system would be able to satisfy the liberal arts philosophy by allowing students to choose a diverse set of courses, but in a way that better allows individuals to cater to their personal intellectual interests.
Not all of the ideas outlined in the committee’s proposal are misguided: It is encouraging that the proposal recommends administrators devote increased funding to the program, especially given past problems with understaffed courses. However, the proposal as a whole entirely misses the mark. At its core, the proposal puts forth an overly complicated solution that suffers from an acute misdiagnosis of the program’s root problems and neglects a clear solution in distribution requirements. The proposal favors complexity and control over simplicity and substance, to the detriment of the program and the students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I opened my email earlier this week to see an email from Dean Khurana, explaining that Harvard's House masters would be changing their title due to concerns about the title’s implications. I anticipated the backlash.
As expected, my Facebook newsfeed flooded with sarcastic comments and impassioned posts about the change: Why do we have to change this title when it doesn’t even come from slave-holding histories? Why is the social justice language police coming down on us again, restricting our speech? What will those lefties do next—come after our Master’s degrees? Such a slippery slope!
I’ll respond: Master’s degrees reflect mastery of a subject. House masters refer to people with tangible power over other people. No one on this campus would liken being a student under a House master to being a slave under a master. However, if the word master used in this context holds connotations that are inextricably linked to a slave-owning title—whether those connotations are accurate or not—we have to address it head-on.
“History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again,” wrote Maya Angelou. Reliving the pain of the past is unnecessary and thoroughly preventable with the help of compassionate administrators. Fellow students might argue that we need to leave “open wounds,” as Dean of Yale Jonathan Holloway would say, in the names of buildings and titles here. I’m here to disagree.
I could tell you the story of the Royall family. I could tell you the story of Mather, Holyoke, and Brattle’s slave ownership. I could tell you that Elizabeth Cabot Cary Agassiz’s husband was instrumental in creating a system of racial typologies designed to prove the superiority of the white race.
Instead, I’ll tell you that despite concerns of “erasing” these histories by renaming buildings or titles, we are actually preventing ourselves from engaging fully with these histories. I spent three years on this campus before I learned about Mather, Brattle, or Agassiz. Why is that? Is it that we’re already erasing the injustices that these powerful families partook in?
During the fall of my freshman year, I went to a reading of a play that was based on President Lowell’s Secret Court of 1920, a covert convening of administrators who systematically expelled a number of male Harvard students for their suspected homosexual activities, leading some to commit suicide. With some determined Googling after the show, I learned that President Lowell had also expelled all black students from the Yard and created quotas to limit the number of Jewish students at Harvard.
If cautious liberals and free speech fanatics are worried about changing the term House master or renaming buildings, I have to ask them once again—why? It can’t be because of erasure, because that’s clearly already happening. If the dark histories of our university’s founding fathers and mothers weren’t being erased, we would already know about the horrors that Lowell enacted upon nonwhite, non-Christian, and queer students. We would already know that Elizabeth Cabot Cary Agassiz was married to a man who tried scientifically to justify his belief that black Americans were “incapable of living on a footing of social equality with the whites.”
Unlike the many concerned community-members in a panic about free speech, speech restriction, and the erasure of history from this renaming, I’m in a panic about the unacknowledged histories that lie in the names of current buildings and titles. I’m completely in favor of finding ways to remember the past and opening up speech that brings new truths to light.
Harvard is not alone in these new changes, and those in a panic about them might recall the recent renaming of the Smith Campus Center and the Danoff Deanship of the College. Where were the moral qualms and outcries regarding these changes? When these kinds of changes happen, they deserve thoughtful critique, too.
In order to face history in the most productive way possible, Royall must fall. House masters must claim a new title. Students must be comprehensively and continually educated about the giants whose shoulders we stood on, and also about whose legacies we will now choose to uphold.
We must critically engage with the painful histories that have given us the names on our buildings, thoughtfully and critically taking history in stride as we find names that better fit the giants whose shoulders we want to stand on. Only through a documented renaming process and a continued teaching of Harvard’s dark history will future students know about the tensions we faced, the injustices we decided to denounce, and the ways that we reformed our campus to make it more reflective and inclusive of the community that we were.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m starting to get bored of wearing sweaters with my arms in the correct sleeves and with the “front” actually facing forward. It just feels, I don’t know…dull.
But before you get the idea that I’m the kind of envelope-pushing, creative-thinking, boundary-breaking mind that casually overturns social norms, I’d like to make one thing clear: If I have you fooled, I am a great poseur. Allow me to explain from the beginning.
My mother, a painter, encouraged my three siblings and me to appreciate art and pursue training at different points in our childhoods. My brother brought home prize-worthy, head-turning pottery. My sisters mastered portraiture and mixed media. And I usually created messes more impressive than the attempts at artwork that gave rise to them.
Nothing about the practice of art inspired me. In fact, it intimidated me. My creative process began and ended with shopping—how delicious is that irony? I could spend hundreds of dollars on glitter, glow-in-the-dark paint, stencils, and iridescent paper. But when I brought it all home and laid it out on a table, I froze.
Colored pencils do not come with usage directions. Canvases do not include suggested compositions. The pen—or pencil, in this case—may indeed be mightier than the sword, but only if you know what to do with it. I certainly did not.
I did, on the other hand, know what to do with clothing. There’s only one thing to do with a sweater, right? Put it over your head, slip your arms through the sleeves, and wear it with pants. For a while, I operated under the impression that fashion came with more guidelines than this mystical thing called “art.” I could plunge right into my closet without hesitation and perform the alchemy of putting together an outfit with considerable confidence, because I believed that articles of clothing came with implicit user’s guides.
As it turns out, even a self-proclaimed Uninspired Individual like me can only wear shirts right-side-front for so long before feeling woefully confined by our society’s norms of dress. Also, one time in eighth grade, I got bored and decided to play a game in my closet.
The Rules: Put together a paparazzi-worthy outfit that’s just a bit too cool for your current lifestyle. Pair items that you have never before worn together.
The Result: a cocktail dress featuring photo-realistic cherry blossom trees, paired with biker boots, topped off with a leopard-print jacket.
Sound insane? It was. And I was hooked. My next move was the logical one: Impose weirder rules, do this on a daily basis, and wear the resulting outfit in broad daylight.
The Newest Recipe: Layer things that have no business coexisting. Use two different prints, at least one inadvisable color clash, and an unnecessary redundancy.
The Most Recent Result: Last Monday’s outfit, which consisted of a plaid shirt, worn over a striped t-shirt, teamed with a corduroy mini-skirt, combat boots, and a camouflage scarf.
Feedback in the form of compliments I received while wearing this outfit leads me to think one of two things. It’s possible that my getup was so bizarre that people couldn’t look away and just blurted out a compliment when I caught them staring. But I’d rather believe that my quirky stripes/plaid combo worked because I decided to commit to the sailor-meets-lumberjack bit.
I want to believe that people react positively to the unexpected.
The best proof of this in human form is Leandra Medine, founder of a wildly successful fashion blog called The Man Repeller. If my word isn’t enough to convince you that Medine and team are a force to be reckoned with, perhaps you’ll be swayed by the slew of endorsements they received when Man Repeller hit it big in 2012. Since then, Medine has appeared on Forbes’s “Top 30 Under 30” list, TIME’s “25 Best Blogs of 2012,” Adweeks’ “Fashion Power 25,” Fast Company’s “100 Most Creative People,” and received a Bloglovin’ award for “Best Overall Blog.”
Medine has the fashion world wrapped around her finger for many reasons, but the most important is that she is wildly experimental and uninhibited when she dresses. She is the woman who challenged herself to wear a button-down shirt three different ways and never once put it on properly. She did, however, brilliantly repurpose it as a skirt.
She is the same woman who taught me just last week that I can wear a sweater tied around my neck as if it were a scarf, if I wish to do so.
I very much wish to do so. Because I’m finding that the more fashion risks I take, the more creative momentum I garner. I certainly wouldn’t be alone if I threw a sweater over a dress and made it look like a skirt. Blair Eadie, the Merchandising Consultant for Tory Burch, features this very trick almost weekly on her personal fashion blog. And why stop there when I could wear my skirt as a shirt?
Initially, my love of clothes was predicated on a misperception: that fashioning an outfit is like curating a museum. I thought that I could leave the “creativity” to fine artists and synthesize their work with ease after they’d done the dirty work. Now, I realize that I was completely wrong. In reality, the best dressers, like the best museum curators, are innovative, out-of-the-box thinkers who don’t take themselves—or any industry dictum—too seriously.
You don’t need to spend millions on a designer bag, injure yourself in a pair of high heels, or wear something that makes you feel self-conscious just for the sake of being on trend. All you need is a little humility and sense of humor.
Imagine how much happier, and more fashionable, the world could be if we all took this to heart.

Many at Harvard are mobilizing to simultaneously give back and pay tribute through a winter clothing drive in honor of Luke Z. Tang ’18, who passed away in September. The drive—organized jointly by Phillips Brooks House and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter—is collecting winter clothing from students to donate to the homeless through Dec. 9.
Tang was a sophomore in Lowell House, and his sudden death in September shook Harvard on campus and beyond. The idea for a clothing drive to commemorate him originally came from Priscilla W. Guo ’18, one of Tang’s friends and a public service representative in Currier House.
“I felt that there should be something greater to remember him by, especially since he was always such a kind individual,” Guo said. “I wanted to honor his legacy of being caring towards others, and just giving back.”
Since Tang was a committed volunteer at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, Guo felt that collecting clothing for the homeless was particularly fitting. After bringing the idea to College administrators and getting permission from Tang’s parents, Guo worked with the Phillips Brooks Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, a PBHA organization, to turn the idea into reality.
Organizers said they publicized the clothing drive and mobilized each House’s public service representative in order to make the drive a campus-wide effort in the hopes of bringing the Harvard community together.
“This is a natural way of paying tribute to someone who was very involved in public service, and also doing good and bringing students together,” said Robert C. Julien, the service to society fellow at PBHA who served as the administrative coordinator of the effort.

In light of recent city council discussion over adopting a $15 an hour minimum wage in Cambridge, a few Harvard Square business owners said they were cautiously supportive of the suggested wage increase but also pointed out a potential increase in prices. 
Anthony Allen, owner of Otto’s Pizza in Harvard Square, supports the transition to a $15 an hour wage as long as it is done in increments.
“I think it’s generally a good idea [to raise the minimum wage] as long as it’s done gradually,” he said.
However, Allen added that his business might need to increase prices. He said that “some of the cost would have to be passed on to the consumer through menu price increases.”
He cautioned that a sudden wage  hike might harm businesses.
“I think it might really impact a lot of restaurants really harshly, but if done gradually I think it would be possible,” Allen said
Similarly Anthony S. Ackil ’99, co-owner of B.good, said that the increase might also lead to an increase in prices for customers.
“I’m always in favor of improving employee livelihood, but I think it’s always a balancing act,” Ackil said. “You can’t just take money out without more money coming in. What it would mean to us is that we would have to raise prices.”
Ackil also pointed out that the wage increase would impact the restaurant industry in Cambridge as a whole.
“It’s hard to make money in the restaurant industry, especially for small restaurants,” he said. “So, I think [the minimum wage is] doable but the whole industry will have to adjust. There are restaurants that will go out of business, and for small businesses like us, it is going to ultimately impact the bottom line.”
However, Ackil said that he is generally supportive of the measure, which he thinks would create a variety of benefits.
“Having happy employees makes for a much better product, operation, and business,” he said. “I like where the current wage trend is going and think that it will ultimately be a good move for Cambridge in the long term [if the measure is adopted.]”
However, Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, cautioned that the minimum wage increase may not be within the city of Cambridge’s purview.
“It will be interesting to see where the council goes with the discussion, as the final decision inevitably is in the hands of the state,” she said.

Using St. Louis as a framework, a lineup of prominent activists and academics held a panel discussion on Thursday on the history of the black civil rights movement and the current state of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Entitled “Generations of Struggle: St. Louis from Civil Rights to Black Lives Matter,” the event drew a large crowd in CGIS South Thursday evening as panelists focused on the intergenerational nature of the current movement.
Elizabeth Hinton, an assistant professor of history and African and African American studies, emphasized that the current Black Lives Matter movement is linked to the civil rights movements of Martin Luther King Jr.’s time through the activism that took place throughout the 1980s and 1990s, of which members of the panel were deeply involved.
St. Louis civil rights activist Percy Green, who frequently made analogies to the natural world, argued that the movement for black rights is ongoing. Referring to the various factors that contribute to a successful movement, Green said, “If the chemistry is there, we even may have a tornado.”
Panelists also discussed the ways the current movement differs from those in the past.
“This isn’t your mother or father’s civil rights movement,” said Tef Poe, a St. Louis rapper and social justice advocate at activist group Hands Up United. “If you come into one of these communities where there’s black folk, and you gonna pull your gun out and you gonna shoot, you will be met by resistance.”
“The U.S. government declared war on black people…the war on drugs is over,” Poe said, in reference to the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last year.
Jamala Rogers, an author and activist from the Organization for Black Struggle, discussed the interconnectedness of many issues for black people today, noting the importance of having a broad focus.
“Our lives are such circles of oppression that it’s very hard to pull one out,” Rogers said. “If you look at the work that I’ve done over the years, they are interdependent.”
Harvard Law School student Derecka M. Purnell, who attended the event, said she was especially interested in the discussion about the intergenerational nature of the movement.
“I think the panel dispelled the myth that there is an intergenerational divide within the movement,” Purnell said. “It showed that it’s possible for people of all generations to work along the same sort of set of politics. It just takes collaboration, openness, and a willingness to hold conversations across the table.”
Walter Johnson, a professor of history and African and African American Studies who introduced the panel, said he organized the event in part because he was deeply passionate about the legacy of racial issues in the U.S.

Yen H. Pham ’15-’16 has received a 2016 Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford, bringing the total number of Harvard undergraduates to win the prestigious award this year to six.
Pham—an inactive Crimson editor and a second semester senior in Dudley House—applied to the Rhodes program through her home country of Australia, where she was awarded one of nine spots allotted for students from that country. The announcement, made Sunday by the Rhodes Trust, was “surreal," Pham said.
“This is obviously the outcome that I had hoped for, but I feel like I totally lack the resources to comprehend what this means,” Pham said.
An English concentrator set to graduate at the end of this semester, Pham will study the contemporary literature of migration while at Oxford. The topic of migration is particularly meaningful to Pham, she said, and is one that has “governed most of [her] life.”
“My parents were refugees to Australia,” Pham said. “That’s something that’s very important to my personal history.”
Pham became interested in studying the literature of migration after taking English professor Philip J. Fisher’s course, “The American Novel: Dreiser to the Present” and reading Willa Cather’s “My Antonia.”
“I found that there were surprising resonances between that book and my personal experience,” Pham said of Cather’s novel.
The relevance of issues surrounding migration to modern world affairs also compelled Pham to study the topic at Oxford.
“Migration is a huge political question at the moment,” Pham said. “I think what is more unusual is why you would study the literature of it and not something more empirical.”
Aside from her personal “bias” toward literature, Pham said she sees merit in understanding the “the human angle” of geopolitics, which literature in particular “does pretty much better than anything else,” she said.
Aside from studying English, Pham said she looks forward to joining the community at Oxford and possibly becoming involved in theater there. In the meantime, Pham said she will enjoy her final weeks at Harvard.

Both the outgoing and incoming presidents of the Undergraduate Council say they support the College’s recent decision to rename the House master position, a title that some students had criticized as associated with slavery.
Earlier this week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—who said the term makes him personally uncomfortable—said the leaders of the College’s 12 residential Houses had agreed unanimously to change their title. Acknowledging that the term means many things—it is often used to mean “teacher”—Khurana said he considered the “social meaning” of the phrase. Changing it looks to “ensure that the College’s rhetoric, expectations, and practices around our historically unique roles reflects and serves the 21st century needs of residential student life,” he argued. 
Some student leaders cited similar reasoning for supporting the change on Thursday.
“Harvard has traditions, but if we need to revisit those practices in order to align with our values today, then a name change is definitely warranted,” Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, the UC’s current president, wrote in an email.
Shaiba Rather ’17, who will assume the UC presidency this weekend, similarly said she and incoming UC vice president Daniel V. Banks ’17 are “excited to see the administration respond to student voices and take steps towards a healthier campus climate.”
“We need rhetoric and practices that not only reflect the mission of the college but also serve the needs of the current diversity of the student body,” Rather wrote in an email.
Although the title has been the subject of debate among administrators for some time, the change came at least in part as a response to ongoing protests against racism raging on college campuses nationwide. Although the debate surrounding the term has attracted more attention at Yale—where the word “master” is also used in their residential housing systems—some Harvard students have also weighed in.
Two weeks ago, a group of Latino students met with University President Drew G. Faust on behalf of some cultural groups and issued a series of demands calling to make Harvard’s campus a better environment for students of color. One request was to change the “House master” title.
Although the incoming and outgoing UC leadership mostly offered praise in response to the decision, some other students had more lukewarm reactions.
Victor C. Agbafe ’19, a UC representative for the freshmen Elm Yard, said he feels “indifferent” about the change. Harvard administrators should engage in dialogue about problems facing students of color instead of simply changing the wording of their titles, he argued.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, a UC representative from Pforzheimer House who unsuccessfully ran for president this year, described himself as happy to see the change, although he called it “nominal.”
“While I am glad that the Administration has taken interest in issues that face communities of color, I hope that this nominal change doesn’t distract them from focusing on more substantive issues that face the community, like diversity in faculty, diversity in mental health services, and more robustly trained race relations tutors,” he wrote in an email.
Greenlaw and his running mate, William F. Morris IV ’17, ran on a platform largely focused on expanding student mental health services, including advocating for more diversity in Harvard University Health Services counseling and mental health staff.
“Let’s not let the discourse end with the name change,” Greenlaw added.
The Crimson’s editorial board, meanwhile, published a strongly worded editorial on Monday that condemned the name change decision as “superficial,” arguing that it detracts attention from more substantial race relations issues.
“Words are words. They have many meanings that change over time,” the board wrote. “Rather than legitimizing these games of word association, Harvard and its administrators ought to spend time addressing actual issues of inclusivity on campus.”
Khurana has said he will update students with a replacement title for the House master position early next year.

GiveWell co-founder Elie Hassenfeld offered advice on how to evaluate charities within an effective altruism framework before a small audience in Sever Hall on Thursday. The talk, titled “How and where should you donate?” was sponsored by the undergraduate student group Harvard College Effective Altruism.
GiveWell, a charity evaluator site, was founded in 2007 by Holden Karnofsky and Hassenfeld, who worked as investment bankers before starting the website. The site publishes a list of “top charities” based on their efficiency as determined by a set of metrics. Hassenfeld estimated that around $13 million was given to charities based on the GiveWell site’s recommendations in 2014. He said that figure is projected to nearly double to $25 million in 2015.
In his talk, Hassenfeld offered case studies of a few of the charities highlighted by GiveWell. He focused primarily on GiveDirectly, which transfers cash to impoverished households in Kenya and Uganda, the Against Malaria Foundation, and two de-worming initiatives—programs which aim to help eliminate parasitic worms.
Hassenfeld praised the impact of GiveDirectly, noting that the organization has been able to sustain rapid growth. GiveDirectly is “the most outstanding organization that we have come into contact with over the years that we’ve done GiveWell,” he said.
Hassenfeld, however, noted that GiveDirectly was not as cost-effective as other organizations, such as many of the de-worming initiatives including the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which he estimated were “in the range of five to ten times as effective as cash transfers.”
At the same time, Hassenfeld argued that GiveWell has “struggled to communicate” with the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and criticized what he said was their poor management and lack of financial transparency.
Hassenfeld also discussed GiveWell’s partnership with Good Ventures, a firm started by Cari Tuna and Facebook co-founder Dustin A. Moskovitz, a Harvard dropout and co-founder of Facebook who formerly belonged to the class of 2006. Good Ventures often gives large sums of money to top charities identified by GiveWell.
In the talk, Hassenfeld outlined his vision for the future of GiveWell, citing new projects that aim to help create new charitable organizations target large donors.
The talk was followed by a long question and answer session during which Hassenfeld fielded inquiries from many of the audience members about GiveWell and effective altruism more broadly.
Ales Flidr ’17, an outgoing co-president of Harvard College Effective Altruism, said that the group has a particularly close relationship with Hassenfeld, who has come to speak at Harvard frequently in recent years.
“[Hassenfeld] presented himself very transparently, very willing to let us know about all his assumptions, and answer really anything,” said Andrew M. Bergman, a graduate student in applied physics who is involved with the graduate student effective altruism group.

One could forgive Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker if he has flashbacks when the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-5) travels to Allen Fieldhouse to play No. 4 Kansas this Saturday.
The last time Amaker and the Crimson (2-5) visited a top-five team on the road, it was handed the program’s worst loss since his first game, a 49-point defeat in Virginia that was certainly worse than the score indicated.
Against the Cavaliers, Harvard scored eight points in the first half, making just five percent of its field goals. On the game, the Crimson starting five combined to go for one-for-32 from the field and had more turnovers than field goals on the day.
The Jayhawks resemble the Virginia squad in many respects. Bill Self’s team has the third-best defensive rating in the country, per Ken Pomeroy, and boasts length and experience at every position. Like Virginia, the Jayhawks have experience across the starting lineup—boasting five upperclassmen starters.
“Obviously [Kansas] is a storied program, as storied as any,” Amaker said. “We know how great they are and how challenging that’s going to be for us with a team like that on that home floor they have.”
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson comes into the game on its second losing streak of the season, having lost five of its last six games, including all four on the road.
Harvard’s early season narrative has been stingy defense and a stop-and-go offense. Although Harvard has shot better from the field and the three-point line than last year’s time, the Crimson average just 63.1 points a game—326th in Division I—due to 15 turnovers a game.
Its last time out, however, the script was flipped on its head. In an 80-71 loss to Northeastern, Harvard shot 55 percent from the field and had 25 assists on 31 field goals.
On the defensive end, the story was far different. Northeastern was the first Harvard opponent to shoot above 40 percent from the field, racking up 14 offensive rebounds and taking nine more shots on the game.
“[It’s] probably law of average, to be very honest,” Amaker said Wednesday. “It’s nice that we were able to see the ball go in the basket a little.”
Against Kansas, Harvard will have to be efficient in its halfcourt offense. The Crimson have been vulnerable to athletic teams who pressure them in the halfcourt, with Providence junior Kris Dunn racking up seven steals in the first half.
While Kansas generates only seven steals a game, it loves to push the pace—playing at the country’s 17th fastest speed, per KenPom. The Jayhawks score 94 points a game, taking nearly 65 shots a contest.
As always, that will start with freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. After a rough initial five games to the season, McCarthy has averaged six assists a game over his past three, making two or more threes in each of his last four.
“I thought there were a lot of encouraging things here tonight we can use as we move forward,” Amaker said after the Northeastern game. “Tommy getting nine assists for a point guard and as a freshman, [it was] a big night for him.”
McCarthy’s shooting percentages over the last four games (28.8 percent from the floor, 32.4 percent from the three-point line) are not far below those of starting KU point guard Frank Mason (39.7 percent and 35.3 percent, respectively). Mason, however, provides the Jayhawks with a steady hand at the point, averaging nearly five assists for every one turnover.
Freshmen guard Corey Johnson has joined McCarthy in the starting lineup through the team’s first seven games. Known for his scoring, the rookie has slowed on the offensive side. He averaged nearly 11 points through the first four games, but has since averaged just five points over the last three contests.
Inside, the Crimson will depend on junior forward Zena Edosomwan to carry the team. The team’s leading scorer and rebounder provides the Crimson with its only consistent post presence.
The standards are clearly highest for the junior, with Amaker commenting after Edosomwan’s last output—a team-high 18 points and seven rebounds—that he can still do more.
“We need more on the backboard,” Amaker said. “He knows that and we’re hopeful that he can give us more, but he isn’t the only one that we need more from on the backboard.”
Edosomwan has echoed similar sentiments all season. Though his production is up significantly from a year ago, he knows that he has needed to expand his role this season.
“My goal is like I want to go there and get 20 rebounds,” Edosomwan said. “That’s my mentality every game and the rest of the stuff, the offense will come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Playing in Tampa, it was a tale of two teams on offense for the Crimson on Thursday night against the No. 23/24 University of South Florida (2-1). The Harvard women’s basketball team shot a season-worst 44.4 percent from the line Thursday in addition to a mere 37.1 percent from the field and 21.7 percent from behind the arc. The 86-59 loss snapped a three game win streak for the Crimson (4-3).
Even with a 64.3 percent team free throw percentage on the season, Harvard was only able to make eight of its 18 chances from the line on Thursday night. Contrarily, the Bulls shot 90.9 percent from the line.
The Bulls were the first nationally ranked opponent Harvard has seen this season.
“Not all of our games go our way,” junior forward Destiny Nunley said. “I think that we’re all very confident in our outside shooters, but we also need to know that the ball is not going to go into the basket 100 percent of the time. We struggle with having the mindset that we need to crash [the basket].”
The second quarter proved to be fatal for Harvard. The Crimson, after gaining a one point lead at the end of the first quarter, was outscored by the Bulls 19-8 in the second frame.
Harvard kept its lead for just two minutes of the second quarter, and it would be the last lead of the night for the Crimson. After a made jumper by senior guard Courtney Williams, USF managed to build up a 10 point lead going into the half.
Co-captain AnnMarie Healy was kept silent in the second quarter. Healy has been the team’s leading scorer all season, averaging 14.4 points per game. Though she ended the game with 13 points and four rebounds, the team followed her trend. Healy scored the majority of her points in the first and third quarters, which was also when the Crimson had the most overall success on offense.
The first quarter, however, was all Harvard. The two teams traded points early on, but after senior guard Shilpa Tummala hit a 3-pointer halfway through the quarter, the Crimson began to pull away. With 5:16 left in the opening period, Harvard went on a five point run to open its lead to 19-11, its largest of the night. The Crimson ended the quarter up 22-21.
Unlike the rest of the contest, Harvard’s shots were falling in the first quarter, as the team shot 56 percent in the frame, including 44 percent from behind the arc.
“I thought that our start of the game was phenomenal,” Nunley said. “We were rotating very well, and it proved itself when we won the first quarter. I think we had our confidence start to shake a little bit with adversity in the second and third quarters, and that’s when we sort of fell apart. What we’ve been working on in practice is staying strong...from start to finish, and I think that we failed at that tonight.”
Although Harvard was able to bring the Bulls’ lead to single digits early in the third quarter, offensive explosiveness by USF and turnovers by the Crimson led to a 20 point Bulls’ lead before the final quarter. With the offensive explosiveness, USF was able to set a quick pace for the game, scoring 19 fastbreak points compared to Harvard’s two.
Fouls and turnovers plagued the Crimson, as the team had 20 fouls on the night, and three of the starters had at least three fouls. The team turned over the ball 12 times.
USF was led by senior forward Alisia Jenkins and Williams who each recorded double-doubles for the Bulls. Jenkins had a game-leading 27 points, which was also a career high, and 20 rebounds.
Williams, who came into the game averaging 28 points per game, finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds. The Bulls nearly doubled Harvard’s rebounding totals, with 55 to the Crimson’s 30.
Healy led the team with 13 points and four rebounds.Though the senior had the highest point total, she shot just 6-for-16 from the floor, including 0-for-5 from three.
Nunley sank five of the team’s eight made free throws. Nunley, freshman guard Madeline Raster, senior co-captain Kit Metoyer, and sophomore Kirby Porter added seven apiece.
“I felt as a team we needed to do a better job of defensive rebounding,” Raster said. “That goes for everybody…. We’re taking pretty good shots. Sometimes they just don’t fall.”­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its 4-0 shutout of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Shillelagh Tournament final last Saturday, the No. 8/8 Harvard men’s hockey team left Compton Family Ice Arena with a trophy.
No such hardware will be up for grabs, however, when the Crimson and Engineers square off again this Saturday at Houston Field House.
Instead, the two sides will play for a prize perhaps more valuable—two points in the ECAC.
RPI (8-5-2, 4-0-2 ECAC) heads into the weekend tied with unbeaten No. 3/2 Quinnipiac atop the conference, leading Harvard (6-1-1, 4-1-1) by a single point. But with the Bobcats heading down the street to take on No. 10/10 Yale this Friday and the Engineers staring at a rematch with the Crimson the following day, the top spot in the ECAC is very much up for grabs.
Prior to its loss to Harvard in South Bend, Ind., RPI had rattled off a nine-game unbeaten streak—a run which included victories over the Bulldogs and now-No. 13/13 St. Lawrence.
But against the reigning conference champions, the Engineers looked outmatched as the Crimson first and second lines wreaked havoc on coach Seth Appert’s squad.
“We had a lot of respect for them,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They were as hot as almost anyone in the country coming in...so I think it got our guys’ attention. And I thought we responded well. Now we go into next weekend with four very important points on the road before the break.”
Crimson co-captain Jimmy Vesey opened the scoring in the first period with his team-leading seventh goal of the year. Vesey, who was named the ECAC’s Player of the Month on Wednesday, now has seven goals in seven career games against RPI.
Each member of the Harvard first line picked up a point alongside Vesey’s strike, as co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and junior center Alex Kerfoot recorded assists on the play. In order to give the Crimson a run for its money on Saturday, the Engineer first line will have to keep pace with Harvard’s power trio.
RPI’s star forward, junior Riley Bourbonnais currently ranks second in the ECAC with eight goals on the year. The offensive power will look to bounce back after being held to just two shots against the Crimson last week.
Bourbonnais’ linemates, senior Milos Bubela and sophomore Viktor Liljegren, also had quiet nights. Liljegren even let his frustration boil over midway through the third period, as he was forced to exit with a game misconduct for a charge against Harvard junior defenseman Victor Newell.
With a chance at redemption in front of a home crowd on Saturday, however, the Engineer top line should come out firing.
Sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, the early favorite to get the start, over freshman goaltender Michael Lackey, in the rematch after making 31 saves against RPI this past Saturday, knows that if he receives the nod this weekend, he is bound to have his hands full.
“We’re definitely going to need to show up to play,” Madsen said. “RPI’s a great team. They had a streak going there, and they’re definitely a team to be reckoned with.”
Prior to its rematch with the Engineers, however, the Crimson will first receive a test from Union at Messa Rink on Friday.
Two seasons removed from its first national championship in school history, the Dutchmen (4-6-3, 1-5-0) have been plagued by inconsistency so far this season.
So far this year, Union has knocked off two ranked out-of-conference teams and tied another, yet the Dutchmen sit tied for last in the ECAC with just two points through six conference games.
Highlighted by an impressive win over then-No. 3/2 Boston University and a 5-5 draw with No. 12/11 Michigan, Union opened the year without a loss in its first five games.
But then the wheels fell off. The Dutchmen went on to drop six of their next seven contests, a stretch that included sizable losses to RPI and St. Lawrence by scores of 5-1 and 6-3, respectively.
Nonetheless, Union has looked much better as of late, even blowing out No. 13/13 Merrimack on the road, 4-0, its last time out. The victory came on the heels of consecutive home games against Brown and Yale where the Dutchmen held leads in the third period before eventually falling in overtime.
Although Union has significant ground to make up in the standings, a win over Harvard would certainly grab the league’s attention moving forward.
Likewise, a win for RPI in Saturday’s rematch with the Crimson would do the same.
Thus, Harvard will not be overlooking either opponent.
“We can’t walk in anywhere this year and grab a win,” Madsen said. “We’re going to have to work hard, and that’s kind of the identity we’re looking for.”

It is that time of year: finals season. The ship has sailed on actually understanding any of the material. You're regretting all that time you spent collaborating, but don’t worry. All hope is not lost. There is one way that you can still pass. You are going to have to make your TF love you. I’m not talking about a nod as you pass by; I’m talking about self-giving love, in Greek, Agape.
How does one do this? That’s a natural question to be asking yourself at this point in the conversation. Have no fear. First things first: go to your review session, actually go. Going to something not required is a sign of commitment. Now, you're at the review session, what do you do? You could ask questions. That’s a risk. You might end up letting on the fact that you have no idea what’s going on. Here’s the safe bet. Just keep nodding. Nod apologetically like you are in complete agreement and have actually been thinking just that for a long while.
Phase two: eye contact. Make direct eye contact with your TF.  Whatever you do, don’t stop staring. This will make you memorable. Next step, is helping your TF remember your name. How to do that? For athletes, this will be easy. Just wear a jersey or something with you name on it. For the rest of us who are going to go to the gym tomorrow because we’re too busy today, the easiest thing to do would be to go on a custom manufacturing website and have a sweatshirt made with your name on it.
The final step: The end of the review session. Now, as you're walking out, take out your phone, pretend to start laughing hysterically as you walk by your TF. Then, apologize and tell your TF a joke, and pretend that was what you were laughing about.
If he or she laughs, start begging for an answer from the final. If the joke falls flat, 1) panic, 2) curl up in fetal position and cry, and 3) don’t stop until you either pass the final or Harvard closes for holiday.

With reading period coming up, students have been subjected to a treasure trove of advice from friends, family, and administrators. Most of this advice for the coming weeks is valuable. However, there are some recommendations that serve no purpose other than to confuse freshman and frustrate upperclassmen:
“Take a break and get some exercise”Exercise? Why start now? For the first time we have a truly legitimate excuse to avoid the MAC. It’s the perfect cop-out. “Sorry can’t go to Zumba, I’ve got reading to do.” And truthfully, a semester’s worth of neglect and second helpings of HUDS dessert cannot be rectified by a couple runs on the treadmill. Better to save the promise of a healthy lifestyle for New Year’s resolutions and next semester, right?
“Just relax”How can one possibly relax? Final projects, papers, and tests abound, all worth ungodly percentages of our final grades. With only twenty-four precious hours in the day we should spare no minute for relaxation. Breathing, eating and possibly sleeping already take up far too much time. As the old saying goes, “Pain is temporary but GPA is forever”.
“You should study the entire time”How can one possibly study the entire time? Classes are over and we deserve a break. What’s an extra one (or six) hours of sleeping in really going to mean for my future? For the past four months I’ve written papers, agonized over problem sets and spent too much time staring a computer screen. Let me play video games, eat microwave mac-and-cheese and complain about upcoming finals without the pressure of constant studying weighing me down.
“Don’t procrastinate”This one should be better phrased “Build procrastination into your daily routine”, because it’s silly to think we won’t put off work. Procrastination is as essential to the college experience as are late nights in Lamont and ramen.
