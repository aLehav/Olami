After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all remember that innocent opening sequence that became a staple of early morning television and yearly Christmas specials; upon hearing that immortalized piano rendition of “Linus and Lucy,” viewers knew that they were in for a fun-filled adventure with Charlie Brown, his gang of friends, and, of course, his beloved dog Snoopy.
Director kat baus ’15  takes a different perspective on this well-remembered story, instead bringing to the stage a sequel that follows the comic strip’s characters into their darker teen years in Bert V. Royal’s “Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead.” The parody of the traditional tales of Charlie Brown and his friends will run from March 27 to 29 in the Adams Pool Theater.
“It was the first piece of theater I had seen that was really written for our generation,” baus says when speaking of their initial motivation to direct the show. “There was something special about that.” As a story centering on Charlie Brown, who begins to question his sexuality and social status following the death of his dog, the play covers issues of drug abuse, suicide, eating disorders, sexual relations, and perhaps most importantly, identity.
“[The play] takes characters that are such a part of American culture—characters who already matter to the audience—and then drops them into situations that only resonate the way they do because the characters have decades of history underlying them,” Colin A. Mark ’17 says. Mark will play the central character, CB (Charlie Brown), come opening night.
“The show honestly could not be more blessed,” says Skip L. Rosamilia ’17, who plays Van, who many may remember from the original cartoon as Linus. Rosamilia praises the team for taking on this show and the new vision that both actors and production team bring to the table. “‘Dog Sees God’ has transformed into so much more than I think Bert Royal could have ever achieved on his own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Four months ago, Vivek H. Murthy ’98, a Harvard Medical School instructor and practicing physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was nominated by President Obama for the position of U.S. Surgeon General. That confirmation seemed all but certain after a November rules change in the Senate set 51 votes as the new requirement for most executive appointees. But that was before the National Rifle Association got involved.
The NRA has mounted an aggressive campaign against Dr. Murthy for his previously voiced support of gun control measures like an assault weapons ban, ammunition size limits, a gun buyback program, and permission for the Centers for Disease Control to study the public health effects of guns. That these sensible reforms—coming at a time when roughly 100,000 people a year are shot in America and one year after the horrific mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School—have drawn so much ire from the NRA is a sad reflection of the extremes to which the pro-gun lobby has driven itself.
The gun-rights group has announced that it would “score” any confirmation vote on Dr. Murthy, meaning that any vote to confirm the nominee would negatively affect a legislator’s annual rating from the group. This is an unusual and disappointing move for the NRA to employ in blocking a nominee for the surgeon general, whose role is largely one of public advocacy, not policy-making. More concerning is the refusal of as many as 10 conservative Democratic Senators, many of whom face uphill reelections this fall, to confirm their president’s nominee. It’s a sad show of political expediency, and it reflects poorly on the leadership of the president as well as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who were similarly unable to stop defections when a bipartisan gun control bill was blocked in the Senate last year.
In his letter to Senators Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell describing his organization’s strong opposition to the nomination, Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA, wrote that Dr. Murthy “would use the office of Surgeon General to further his preexisting campaign against gun ownership.” But mandatory licensing, waiting periods, and limits on certain kinds of ammunition are far from radical positions. These reforms are desperately needed to reduce a broken system in which nearly 10,000 American children are injured or killed by guns each year.
Cox dismisses the buyback program that Murthy endorsed, even though the Australian buyback program in 1996—begun in response to a massacre in Tasmania that killed 35—was hugely successful: The firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates both fell by around 60 percent.
Most disturbing is the NRA’s implicit message that gun violence is not only a problem not worth solving, but also an issue that shouldn’t be discussed. But as Aldous Huxley wrote, “Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.” 
If the gun violence that kills thousands of Americans each year doesn’t qualify as a public health issue worthy of the surgeon general’s attention, then what does? The political opposition to Dr. Murthy is counterproductive, and reflects a broken system of politicized nominations.

On July 2, 1937, at around midnight, Amelia Earhart and fellow aviator Fred Noonan embarked in a Lockheed Electra from Lae—the second largest city in Papua New Guinea—en route to Howland Island, a tiny desolate island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. At 8:43 a.m. that morning, the USCGC Itasca, stationed near Howland, lost radio contact with the Electra.
 
For the next 16 days, as the US Navy scoured the South Pacific in search of the plane, the media covered each and every development. During that time frame, according to research through ProQuest, the New York Times published at least 12 front-page stories about the search, the Boston Globe 16 stories, and the New York Herald Tribune 26.
 
A rash of theories about the disappearance arose—from the plane crashing into the Pacific to landing on nearby Gardner Island. Everyone had an opinion, and the media was more than willing to share them. On July 15, the New York Herald Tribune ran the headline, “Woman Psychic Asserts Amelia Earhart Is Safe.”
 
This should all sound too familiar. The search for Flight 370—the missing Malaysian passenger plane bound for Beijing—has reached a tragic conclusion, with many questions left unanswered. After a 16-day search effort that involved two dozen nations and more than three million square miles, the Malaysian authorities announced: “We have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived. … We must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean.”
 
As with the Earhart disappearance, the media frantically covered this missing plane. Everyone, both qualified and unqualified, seemed to have a theory—a cockpit fire, hijacking, plane malfunction, sabotage—and the media eagerly published and broadcasted many of them. News outlets examined the evidence (such as stolen passports, a potential oil slick, and aircraft simulators), and each new possible lead constituted “Breaking News” for CNN. The media also acutely focused on the grieving families of passengers.
 
There’s also been much commentary, ironically coming from the media, on the media’s handling of the story—particularly directed at CNN. The harshest critics argue that by its endless coverage, certain newscasts have cinematized a tragedy to bolster ratings or diverted focus from more “newsworthy” stories such as the Syrian crisis or the geopolitical turmoil surrounding Crimea.
 
These criticisms of coverage of Flight 370 hold some weight. A vanished airplane is a spectacular event—meant for films and books—that sells newspapers and glues eyes to screens. After the plane went missing, CNN’s primetime ratings jumped 68 percent over the year's average; the BBC’s reporting generated more traffic to its website than any news story since the 2011 Japanese tsunami. The uptick in numbers allowed the media to capitalize on an extraordinary event without as much consideration for the story’s news value.
 
Of course, news outlets should actively cover a story as big as that of Flight 370. A large passenger plane vanishing without a trace is significant news: Any potential foul play in aviation post-9/11 deserves our attention, and the efforts to find those aboard are of severe urgency. The story of Flight 370 needed to be told—it’s an important and tragic one.
 
And yet the reporting played out like a mystery novel, with false leads, potential culprits, large stakes. The plight of Flight 370 should one day appear as a book, with each piece of evidence weighed and scrutinized. But that’s not the strength or function of the current news media. In the quest to fill 24-hour time slots, CNN and other outlets relied upon non-news about Flight 370, delving into unqualified speculations, emotional pulls, and conspiracy theorizing. CNN even devoted time to discuss whether a black hole could account for the flight’s disappearance.
 
The frantic grab to report anything remotely related to Flight 370 diluted the actual news value of the event. By doing so, it obscured its tragedy and left an unsavory taste of exploitation for high ratings. This kind of behavior threatens the credibility of media outlets.
 
Time will pass, and Flight 370’s disappearance will drift from the intense media spotlight. Some questions may never be answered. Consider Earhart’s disappearance: As recently as 2012, more than 75 years after the Electra vanished, researchers still search for the wreckage.
 
It should come as no surprise that a missing plane generated much coverage and speculation. But when overdone and ill focused, media coverage itself becomes a spectacle that diminishes the news value of its subject. The lasting story of Flight 370 will be that 239 people were tragically lost. Reporting need not devolve into sensational journalism; the story can tell itself.

On March 31, I will be walking out of class alongside hundreds of other students from across Massachusetts. We will be going to the office of Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and calling on him to ban the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure. 
As California author Rebecca Solnit wrote a few weeks ago, “Sometimes the right thing to do in ordinary times is exactly the wrong thing to do in extraordinary times.” Solnit was referring to the foot-dragging and inaction of San Francisco bureaucrats charged with investigating fossil fuel divestment for the city’s pension funds—but her point is relevant to our entire generation. In the age of urgent climate crisis and with a government largely overwhelmed by the influence of fossil fuel companies, nothing short of extraordinary action has a hope of making the change our generation desperately needs.
The International Energy Agency projects that by 2017—just three years away—we will have built so much fossil fuel infrastructure that we will be locked in to irreversible and extremely dangerous levels of warming. Without action, our generation could face a future in which entire cities and countries disappear under rising seas, our sources of water and food become unpredictable, and millions need to migrate and seek refuge.
No matter what happens, our generation will likely inherit a world terribly warped by climate change—but we probably have not yet crossed the line between climate disaster and climate catastrophe. If we act boldly now, we still have a chance to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.
On March 31, the Youth Walkout for Climate Justice will push for the governor to redirect future energy investments into clean energy, energy efficiency, and conservation. This would be an unprecedented step—but one exactly in line with the IEA’s projections and one commensurate with the scale of the climate crisis. It would finally set the Commonwealth on course to responsibly transition to a full, clean electricity system. If other states and nations followed suit, it could be a step that turns the tide on fossil fuels. 
Statewide organizers at Students for a Just and Stable Future, the Massachusetts campus network organizing the walkout, have heard that the governor’s office is seriously considering this ban. We have real leverage here because Governor Patrick, whom many speculate will run for president someday, knows that he needs our generation solidly behind him. As increasingly powerful hurricanes and wildfires take their toll, the issue of climate change will only grow in importance during our elections. 
By responding to our call on March 31, Governor Patrick has the chance to define himself as a climate visionary and staunch advocate for the future of hope in this country. It is the kind of step that could help Governor Patrick win the presidency—in other words, our walkout might be powerful enough to convince him to make this unprecedented, game-changing move.
How extraordinary of a moment does it need to be to prompt you to walk out of class?
The injustices of racism led Harvard’s future president, Drew G. Faust, during her time as an undergraduate student at Bryn Mawr, to ditch her midterms and travel south to march with Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. With the lives of millions at stake, many of whom did little or nothing to cause the problem, are the injustices of the climate crisis horrible enough to prompt you to walk out next Monday?
Choosing to break the rules and walk out of class isn’t easy. It’s hard to detach yourself from the daily routine of homework and classes. It’s hard to step out of the culture at Harvard that drives us to relentlessly pursue personal achievements. It’s hardest of all to recognize that we must break rules in order to survive, especially when following rules has worked out so well for the lives of most Harvard students.
And yet, following the rules and conventions that let the machinery of climate disaster rumble forward will only lead us, like mindless lemmings, over the climate cliff. If our generation wants to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, we must do something extraordinary to disrupt this dangerous status quo.
To repeat Rebecca Solnit’s wise words: “Sometimes the right thing to do in ordinary times is exactly the wrong thing to do in extraordinary times.” 
At the end of the day, essay due dates are not the most important deadlines that we face. Will you walk out of class on March 31 to join us in fighting for climate justice before this precious moment escapes?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Beginning today in Washington D.C., a group of poets have assembled for a weekend devoted to the performance and celebration of socially engaged works.  Hosted by Split This Rock, “Poems of Provocation and Witness” is a four-day national festival held every two years. Poets and activists will converge from across the country to read and recite; attend panels and workshops; and network with writers, community organizers, and youth organizations. Their goals are “to speak out for justice” and “to demand that our government stop spying on us.”
 
Split This Rock—taking its name from Langston Hughes’s poem “Big Buddy”—intends to build a network of those who aspire to greater influence in public life by using poetry to advocate for social change, defend rights of freedom of expression, and renew consciousness of social responsibility in a diverse and complex world. Even in advance of the 2014 Poetry Festival, Split This Rock’s impact is already considerable: The March issue of Poetry Magazine—the oldest English language monthly periodical of its kind, and one of the nation’s most venerable—published a portfolio of work by the festival headliners.
 
Advocacy for social justice and social responsibility, defending human rights, bearing witness to the diversity of human struggle and experience—noble goals, I’m sure we can agree to that. But Split This Rock is also dedicated to “revitalizing poetry as a living, breathing art form with profound relevance in our daily lives and struggles.” Here is a point worth arguing—is poetry something dead, is poetry Lady Lazarus? Is there really a golden age of a perfectly just, perfectly literate Poetic Republic? I do not think so.
 
In fact, I find the idea of Poetry-in-need-of-defibrillation to be very damaging to artists and activists. The obsession—and the death of poetry is one—obscures a real question for literati to consider. If we stop longing for a world saturated with—ruled by—poetry, we can focus instead on questions like: Why is there a dearth of socially engaged poetry? Consider why publicly interested poetry falters in the U.S. whereas in the wider world (Eastern Europe or Afghanistan, for example) it thrives; it inspires popular respect and fear in the autocrats.
 
Even on these new premises, I fear there is a chance to repeat the same mistake, to reason from a false assumption: How can we be sure that there is a dearth of American poetry focused on social questions, poetry that takes risky and controversial stands, poetry that eschews modernist complexity and ambiguity in exchange for simple and direct appeals?
 
Here it would be best to put a human face on the problem. Consider a poet—let’s consider Bill Knott. Knott died this March; before his death I had neither heard of him nor read a word he wrote. Perhaps this is true of many of us here at Harvard. Despite Knott’s 25 years of teaching at Emerson College and the many books published during his 74 years including self-published chapbooks and a volume printed by FSG, “The Unsubscriber,” I had no clue who he was or how important he was in the 1970s. Thomas Lux said in Ploughshares Magazine, “His best work re-affirms that poetry can be something that does more than lie on a page.”
 
Knott’s claim to fame came in 1966 when he hoaxed the established poetry world with a fake suicide letter to the journal “Epoch.” But his poems were new and radical; Knott’s poems were short, accessible, and highly critical of the Vietnam War. He spoke of his struggles: Knott was an orphan, a former mental patient, spent two years in the army.
 
Yet Knott believed himself to be “persona non grata and universally despised or ridiculed by everyone in the poetry world.” Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. But he clearly lacked the standing and recognition garnered by some of his fellow poets. And he took this lacking recognition to heart, wore it proudly like a medal. Always class conscious, with his admixture of praise and bitter scorn, Knott wrote, “Mark Strand has the right to write a poem, not me. He went to Yale. … Me, I grew up in an orphanage, no family, no money, no ‘educational opportunities.’ No background, no breeding. Scum like me can’t write poems.”
 
Thus Knott himself made the lottery of birth into self-fulfilling prophecy. He alienated even poets that praised his work; he split from publishers and chose self-publishing over traditional publishers, over even smaller independent publishers. But if you go to Lamont Library, to the Woodberry Poetry Room, you won’t find his books: They were demoted to the Harvard Depository in 2011.
 
The world of poetry is not an egalitarian paradise. Meritocracy is still a form of aristocracy. Established structures of inequality block many from education in art, from a life in the republic of letters. Knott’s story makes this clear. It leaves me only tepid optimism for Split This Rock. The mistakes of elitism and exclusion are easy to repeat. I hope they do not waste their chance to (re)discover in American poetry some of Knott’s spirit.

As the school year drudges on, the brown and grey buildings of Cambridge can often feel as confining as our stacks of midterm papers and textbooks. But spring is here, and the sporadic weather can reward us with some gorgeous days. Grab some friends and escape the confines of campus for a day trip to the Arnold Arboretum, the urban nature center maintained by both Harvard and the City of Boston.
Take a Hike!
The Arnold Arboretum lets visitors strike a balance between a stroll through the manicured lawns of Boston Common and the ruggedness of your FOP trip, minus the stale tortillas and bug bites. With wide, paved paths reminiscent of service roads, the chances of spraining your ankle on a rock are few, but it’s still best to wear comfortable shoes for climbing hills. Many of the paths are flat, making it an easy walk for all fitness levels, but it’s definitely worth the harder hike to the top of Bussey Hill, where it’s practically mandated that visitors stop and admire the view of the Boston skyline. The park paths are linked by main roads, making it difficult to get lost, but it’s still a good idea to pick up a map at the Hunnewell Visitor Center, located right by the Arborway Gate.
Free and Easy
Admission to the arboretum is free with donations welcome, and it is open every day of the year from dawn until dusk. However, for the map readers and tour takers out there (I’m looking at you, visiting grandparents), the Visitor Center is only open on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m. To get to the Arboretum itself, which is in Boston proper, take the not-so-scenic MBTA Orange Line to the Forest Hills stop, its southernmost end. Leave the T stop through the “Arnold Arboretum” exit and follow the Arborway to the Forest Hills Gate. From here, it’s about a ten-minute, tree-lined walk in the park to the Visitor Center.
Don’t Forget Your Camera
The Arboretum is home to 15,000 types of plants, ranging from familiar maples to a wildflower meadow and bonsai trees. Don’t just stare at your feet like when you walk through the Square, or you could miss surprises like the bright Azalea Border right inside the main gate. Though some guests come to run or rollerblade away from the hustle and traffic of the city, most visitors take leisurely walks and take ample photos. Since spring is just beginning in Boston, be sure to come see the first delicate pink rhododendron blossoms. You may find the perfect backdrop for your next profile picture, or perhaps get an opportunity to judge the girl who’s standing right in front of the plants and taking selfies. And the Arboretum isn’t all flowers—the varied collection offers trees and shrubs from around the world. As a Minnesotan far from home in Boston, I felt at home when surrounded by pine trees and spruces. Also, if you’re up for some family-friendly (read: swarming with small children) festivities, be sure to attend the Lilac Sunday celebration on May 11, with food vendors, games, and a giant picnic on the lawn.
People-Watcher’s Paradise
As an in-city park with free admission, the Arboretum attracts a crowd ranging from high-school track teams to students, elderly couples, and bike commuters. Often, watching your fellow guests can be as enjoyable as watching the plant life. Most guests travel in pairs or packs, from young parents pushing babies in strollers to hipster couples peering out from behind the giant lenses of their DSLRs. The Arboretum also plays host to a wide variety of dogs, which are required to be on-leash but welcome petting from lonely college students. Get a workout in at the Arboretum, too! From personal experience, it takes about half an hour to run to the main gate from campus, and it’s a welcome change from the Charles River path. For those who are less into the athletic possibilities of the Arboretum, the paths are spotted with green benches for relaxing, reflecting, and spectating. If you walk briskly enough to the T, you might even work up enough of a sweat to return to campus with a “healthy glow.”
This spring, don’t get stuck in the library every weekend. Make a day trip to the Arnold Arboretum for some fresh air and sunshine, or make an evening visit to pair the sunset with the silhouettes of trees or the Boston skyline. A beautiful slice of urban nature, the Arboretum is like nothing on campus—or in Boston!

This time of year a few fortunate young people receive an email posing a marvelous question: Would you like to attend Harvard? Those that say yes will become the Class of 2018, offering a variety of reasons for their decision, which boil down to Harvard is oldest and Harvard is best—at nearly everything.
The “many and various” reasons University President Drew G. Faust’s predecessor, Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, gave to the Class of 1918 were pretty much the same: Been around for centuries, preeminent academics, well-connected alumni, great financial aid, and a great variety of “the athletic sports.”
It was easy to get in then. No personal essays required, just a series of entrance examinations. Seventy-three percent of applicants were admitted. Admittedly, there are lots of reasons to discount these numbers. The exams required special preparation available only at a few elite prep schools. There was no Common App, no female students, and only 937 people applied. But that’s not much comfort to the many thousands of students nervously hoping this year for a Crimson-colored “yes”; perhaps 5 percent of applicants will receive that happy news.
Today’s students do have at least one reason to be cheerful. The world is not on the brink of a massive war—assuming the Russia-Ukraine situation stabilizes. One hundred years ago, as the freshmen of 1914 moved into the dormitories, they listened to long speeches about the unraveling situation in Europe. Before they could graduate, many of them found themselves wearing uniforms on the battlefields where they fought in trenches, flew planes, and died. Some of those that survived the First World War perished in the second. 2018, we can only hope, will experience no world wars.
Brand new dormitories greeted the class of 1918, right where Lowell House and the community garden sit today. In those days freshmen lived by the river. Seniors occupied the yard. The new buildings, two years in the making, “combine[d] the atmosphere of Hollis, Stoughton, and Holworthy, with modern, comfortable, and inspiring surroundings,” according to a Crimson article published in 1914.
Next year’s freshmen will have to wait for a year—and get lucky in the housing lottery with one of the renovated houses—before they have the fortune to experience the neo-colonial living with all the comforts of modernity.
A time-traveling 1918er would find a few familiar aspects on campus. The Anderson Memorial Bridge across the Charles River was under construction back then, too. And the Fogg Art Museum seems to be on a 100-year cycle of collection reshuffling and roof readjusting. The museum reopened during the class of 1918’s freshmn year; the new iteration of the Harvard Art Museums opens this fall.
Freshmen today can more easily keep track of such campus developments. The Crimson, for example, is online and freely delivered to the slots on freshmen dorm doors. Back in 1914, reading the news cost $3 a year. News over those years included  the dedication of a marble sun-dial given by the class to the university, invitations to “smokers” where everyone got together to watch short movies, and the selection of the class song, written by lacrosse player Edward McCabe, who went on to become a high school music teacher. At the end of freshmen year, the 1918ers produced a red book, bound in soft Morocco leather, summarizing the accomplishments of the class. Even the skeptics at The Crimson were impressed: “we may be justified in expecting a great deal of that class.”
By senior year, the news sunk into the unpleasant and tragic. Half the class had left campus for war, and they were dying—about one death a day. Those remaining in Cambridge shivered in a bitterly cold winter. With coal diverted to wartime uses, students were sent out to chop firewood. In June, they tossed confetti, collected degrees, and headed out into the world, if they hadn’t been fighting in it already.
At the head of the class, alphabetically, was Jacob Bates Abbott ’18. He served in the war, then worked in bonds before quitting to illustrate a comic strip titled “The Gay Stone Age.”  Most of the class of 1918 was from around Boston. A few came from abroad: Japan, Lebanon, Denmark, China. Constantine Chezreki ’18 grew up in the Balkans; after Harvard, he briefly served as president of Albania. Many went to work in manufacturing, some in the “mercantile” industry, and a few in brokerage. In January 1943, Prescott Townsend ’18 was jailed for homosexuality; he helped start the gay rights movement in America.
Six months later, the Class of 1918 gathered for their 25th reunion. World war overshadowed the festivities again; Vietnam loomed over the next anniversary. Paul Bloomfield Zeisler ’18, the last of the class, had transferred to the University of Chicago and become a lawyer. By the 50th anniversary report, Zeisler had quit the profession and seen enough of life: “I like the world...less and less each day that passes.”
The class of 2018 have a few decades to enjoy first.

When I casually strolled into the Corner Office bar in Orange County, Calif. before noon on March 20, I can’t say I was really expecting to see many people. As anticipated, I was greeted at the door by four very friendly bartenders and a whopping total of three other patrons. Unsure if this was a result of March Madness apathy or the fact that most adults are at work at 11 a.m., I sat down and ordered some food. I glanced around the bar to find the Harvard-Cincinnati game was playing on exactly none of the 17 televisions mounted to the walls. Dressed in a Harvard jersey and hat, I received some inquisitive stares as I flagged down one of the bartenders and asked if she could possibly put the Harvard game on. Figuring this might be a long and lonely two hours, I settled in to watch Harvard take an early lead.
Before long, however, people began trickling in. Many were dressed in nice clothes and I assumed they were professionals on lunch break who had come to watch the game, but a fair amount of regulars surrounded me before long as well. I sat in a corner and attempted to observe the patrons and listen to their conversations without coming across as a complete creep and noticed most customers were not even watching the screens. The only mention of the games at all came when one patron remarked on the Ohio State-Dayton upset as the game ended. My self-conscious silence was broken when one man, Dave, noticed I was watching the televisions and proceeded to ask me who my team was. At my response he exclaimed, “Wait, but they’re not in the tournament, are they? Oh, they’re winning? Well, would you look at that.” Clearly, I felt, the amount of fanship and team spirit in this county was not high.
My luck began to change as a regular named Billy, who I later found out had apparently disappeared for a month and reappeared that day acting as though nothing had happened, sat down next to me and inquired as to who exactly I was. As we chatted it naturally came up that he was curious from where I was visiting—when I told him, others overheard and the news traveled along the bar. All of a sudden there was a much greater interest in both myself and the game. One man came up to tell me, “Harvard’s got a solid team this year,” but he had put money on Cincinnati, and (with no hard feelings, naturally) he was therefore hoping we would lose.
Another young woman then stepped in on my behalf, saying she’d bet on Harvard and was eager to cheer them to victory. No one seemed to have strong personal allegiance to any team, however; the concern and attention to March Madness as a whole was solely for monetary reasons. Regardless, as a result of this new interest in the Harvard-Cincinnati game, those who were previously uninterested chose sides and nearly everyone, at least about thirty people or so, began watching and cheering for one team or the other.
At this point only five minutes remained on the clock. The game was close. Before long it was showing on screens other than the one in my corner, and shouts and clapping could be heard reverberating around the room whenever anything interesting happened on screen.
What had begun as a boring and uninteresting game to most and a very awkward experience for me turned into a massive, establishment-wide competition and a way to make fast friends as the possibility of an upset became clear to all. As the last seconds of the game ticked away and Harvard’s victory was secured, those on the losing side congenially wished those on the winning side luck for the rest of the tournament, though they took care to mention they though Harvard would bomb out against Michigan State. Take what you can get, I suppose.
Attention shifted away from the televisions and back to the food and drinks, as people discussed their brackets or looked around for the next game ending soon in order to catch only the last five minutes and not have to spend two hours watching an entire game. Feeling oddly as though the game had never happened, I took my leave, and Billy wished me a great life.
As I left, I walked by a new arrival and heard him ask the person next to him why so many people were there, and what on earth was “March Madness.”

Going to Iceland for spring break was not my idea, really. My friend, a senior who will soon be a working woman in a tall, mighty tower in New York City, wanted to have one last trip before she committed to a no ­vacation offer. The location remained undetermined for months. Darjeeling, as advertised by Wes Anderson, was a good candidate considering the mission of the trip, but Reykjavik, as advertised by Icelandair on the T, won the competition with cheaper fares.
I huddled under my blanket on the plane there. The screen in front of me had already started taking me to the geysers, designer stores where I could buy a lopi sweater, and uninhabited areas to look for the Northern Lights. I rested my head on my pillow with an Icelandic lullaby written on it, listening to Sigur Rós. An hour later as I walked to baggage claim, I read the quotes by inspirational ­ssons and ­dottirs of Iceland that dotted the walls. One stuck with me throughout the trip: “I feel emotional landscapes; they puzzle me.”
Over espresso and a croissant at a coffee shop that first morning, we went through guides of the city in an attempt to plan the coming five days. The number of attractions I marked on the source sheets matched the number of bars I starred for our four nights in Reykjavik. Reykjavik is home to two-thirds of the less than 300,000 Icelanders, and it looked like we might need to leave the bounds of the small city. The black and white shapes in the horizon sat patiently, waiting for us to realize that a trip to Iceland is not about conquering the stars on a map of Reykjavik.
In my first and only day in the city, I wandered under the puffy clouds, looking at houses that glowed in the grey—the purple one that followed the green, the red­roofed blue, the orange. I picked one of the three locations of the Reykjavik Art Museum where an exhibit titled “Cadences of Line and Color” was on view and went in. The most fascinating works were by Icelandic artists whose videos flooded my eyes with shapes and colors, leaving me in a trance as music—sometimes imagined through the rhythmic visual changes, sometimes real compositions by the artists themselves or by their collaborators—played in the background. The exhibit made my decision to go out and to soak in whatever fed these artists under the Icelandic landscapes outside the city. That night, at a bar called Boston, with only one possible allusion to New England adorning its wall (a moose head), we booked two tours that would take us to the wilderness.
The tours emptied our pockets but showed us the real Iceland. Prices were determined by the vehicle you chose to roam the fields: an Icelandic horse—famous for its five gaits and friendliness—a safari jeep, or a bus. We settled for having window dust in our photos—the fewer photos you take, the more your eyes will take in. As we left Reykjavik behind, driving past houses and bigger buildings and facing the lava fields ahead, the black and white patterns surrounded us, and the snow swallowed the bus.
Our tour guide himself was aloof as he narrated the surroundings: “We are passing an education village on your left. Well, it used to be more educational, they say. There are two reasons for this: The teachers are on strike and the students are happy. Yes, the students are very happy. Also, there used to be a housewife school up here for fifty years where they tried to teach our wives how to cook and clean. But after trying for 50 years they quit. Now, we have to teach them.” But neither the stale jokes nor the rotten egg smell could divert me from the landscape. The geysers, the mid­-Atlantic ridge, where we could see the two continental plates, and the waterfall were all fascinating, but after every stop I scurried back to the bus, afraid to be blown about by the wind or slip on ice, and hoping to get back on the road to watch the lava fields and mountains in the distance.
On the second day of the tour, we were in the mountains, and I kept losing my balance as I tried to fit my crampons on my hiking boots to venture out to the glaciers between two overdue volcanoes: Hekla and Katla. The ice crushed under my feet and the sharp spines of my crampons stuck in. No matter how aggressive my steps were, the mountain stood still as we walked up and down the hills, climbing its sides. I kept waving my ice pick, trying to insert it a little deeper to pull myself up and finish the climb, but the glacier resisted my blows. I looked up to see where I was hitting, and a chunk of ice fell on my cheekbone. With the rush of blood to my cheek, I realized that it hadn’t occurred to me that the ice was real, that it was a part of the mountain, that the ice was packed meters and meters deep, flowing from the heights of the peak. The mountain’s indifference had given me the illusion that I was free and strong, yet with one blow, I was hanging in the air. Our small group walked in crouched posture as we turned back to the bus, slowly getting whiter and whiter with the snow sticking to our coats. People slept on the way back. In my dream, I drowned in emotional landscapes surrounded by glaciers and lava fields.
As I sipped my coffee on the plane home, I learned a new Icelandic word from my cup: “Strókur: a column of steam rising from a natural hot spring.” I looked around to see other Harvard students who I had spotted on the Northern Lights tour, hunting for Aurora Borealis (which at this time of year are merely faint tilts in the sky that only form beautiful shapes when captured with a camera in 30 second shutter speed), the Blue Lagoon tour, immersing in the hot waters, or the Lebowski bar, drinking the White Russian of their choice. I wondered if they had seen it too, if the mountain talked to them as it did to me. I pondered over the lava fields and how they were going to change once Hekla erupts in a few days as expected. Then, I turned on the “Unique Iceland” documentary, but I had been to most of the sights depicted in it, and I turned it off again with the contentment that I had seen Reykjavik as advertised.

The Bracket Boys emerged one March in my sophomore year of high school, wearing the same sweaty jerseys for days on end and trading wrinkled dollar bills under the lab tables in chemistry class. Or maybe they had always been there, furiously scribbling on those all-important flowcharts, and I had simply never noticed them before. After all, I had only just realized that March Madness was not, in fact, an insanity-inducing disease brought on by a seasonal resurgence in bacteria.
That month, papers torn by too much pencil erasure circulated through the classrooms. Teachers either didn’t notice or didn’t mind, possibly because from a distance the brackets looked similar enough to the periodic table.
As for me, I had never watched a basketball game in my life, and the chart on my desk really was for chemistry class. I was only a spectator of spectators, orbiting this strange cultural phenomenon like the outermost ring of electrons around a nucleus.
This year, I was assigned to enter that nucleus, to cheer on Harvard’s team and observe fans in a New York City sports bar. I imagined them as the grown-up versions of the Bracket Boys: same torn papers in hand, just more facial hair and the legal drinking age. I decided to watch the game at a bar in the East Village known for its New England clientele—“Professor Thom’s.”
The bar itself is flanked by at least five large screens, all showing the Harvard-Cincinnati game. A group of about 20 men sit around it, and if I squint, they do sort of look like the Bracket Boys. Something dramatic happens on screen, they cheer uproariously, and I inwardly congratulate myself on finding the perfect spot.
I realize that I don’t know where to sit. I have the sense that all of the grown-up Bracket Boys know each other, and that taking a seat at the counter would be intrusive. The booths, though, seem a bit removed from the action. I settle for walking into the middle of bar and waiting awkwardly for something to happen.
The manager approaches me, and I think that he’s going to solve my problem by telling me where to sit. He has an unshaven, jowly chin that bobs a few inches above the collar of his plain white t-shirt.
“ID please?”
“Oh, I’m not planning to drink—“
“Doesn’t matter. Can’t be in the bar if you’re under 21. It’s a liability.”
My stomach sinks, but then I realize that I will be fine. I’m a journalist! Journalists always manage to go places they’re officially barred from. Warzones and the like. As soon as he sees that I’m on a mission for the noble cause of the written word…
“But I go to Harvard,” I start, and as soon as the words leave my mouth I realize how awful they sound. I know before the next two minutes of begging ensues that I will fail. The man’s chin shakes in the opposite direction of his head as he points toward the door while I claim desperately that “I just want to write.”
I walk outside, outraged that I have just been told I am not old enough to do something. Then, I do what any independent adult would: break down, and call my dad to ask for advice. He recommends a bar on 7th Street.
I enter “Standings,” where college pennants dangle in clusters from the ceiling like colorful grape vines. In a space no larger than twenty square feet, it seems that these Bracket Boys have brought their girlfriends, their girlfriends’ girlfriends, and even that weird guy from work. The Harvard game is on, but muted and ignored, and the shouting seems more enthusiastic during commercials. It’s so crowded that I can barely push half of my body through the door before being pushed out by the sheer force of sweaty bodies. I am spared, at least, a request for an ID.
I trudge back down 2nd Ave., ready to enter any bar out of sheer desperation, Harvard fans or not. I see one flanked by two large men with walkie-talkies and bulky arms pressed against their chests. Smoke spills out from behind two roped off doors. I don’t even have to ask—I’m a liability.
Two doors down, I spot a bar called “The Travelling Scholar.” It sounds Harvard-esque, and perhaps my nobility-of-journalism speech will go down better here. It doesn’t, but the barman takes pity on me. He points me toward Ryan’s Irish Pub, next door, where they serve lunch and allow minors, though it soon proves to lack the atmosphere I’m looking for. The gold-countered bar is flanked by only four customers: a beanie-wearing hipster smoking a cigarette, a man with one earring who’s trying to pick up the barmaid, and a couple bent over an iPhone game of Flappy Bird. No one watches the game on the larger screen.
I sit down anyway, and try to enjoy the game alone. I realize, as I watch the tall figures on screen circle around each other, that I have absolutely no idea what’s happening. I can’t even read the score, having left my glasses at home.
The bartender, a short, pretty blond woman who looks vaguely like Amanda Seyfried, asks me what I’d like to drink. I order a Virgin Mary, which I think sounds mature, if not alcoholic.
They’re out of the mix. She asks me if a Shirley Temple would be all right. Because there’s nothing else to be done, I accept.
I try to compensate by taking out my notebook and writing at the bar. Just when I am beginning to feel appealingly like Hemingway, I see that the beanie-wearing hipster has also opened his Moleskine. Would I like a refill of that Shirley Temple? Absolutely. With nothing else to lose, I eat the candied cherry.
On the train ride home, I check my phone and see that Harvard has won the game. I find this out the same way I always have: the Bracket Boys have Facebook statuses.

The ice crunches beneath my feet as I follow my roommates out into the middle of Eliot courtyard. It’s surprisingly bright out for 6:30 a.m., and some combination of adrenaline and the traditional Housing Day mimosa I consumed in one of the party suites robs the frigid wind of its sting. We stand with our backs to each other and shout at the surrounding walls. “Good morning Eliot! It’s Housing Day! It’s Housing Day! Get up, get up, get up!” We stand still for a moment, watching as lights start to pop on in the windows that line the courtyard. Eliot is waking up.
By 7 a.m., a small contingent of Eliotites has made it to the dining hall. More join them every minute. There’s a clash between throbbing dance music and yawning upperclassmen struggling to stir their coffee. I spot one of my friends—a sophomore—hunched over a bowl of cereal head in hands. He grimaces when he sees me. “Was that you shouting this morning?” he asks. I smile sheepishly. “It’s tradition!”
The energy in the room quickly begins to build. The chanting and dancing begins. Pajamas and jackets are shed in favor of the blue and red housing day shirt. Faces are painted. House Administrator Sue herds everyone outside for a picture. When we’re done, most of the jackets go back on. It is really cold outside.
This doesn’t faze Cam J. Heron ’14, a Stein Chair Emeritus; his shirtless torso is covered with blue and red handprints. I watch as he climbs on top of one of the tables and brandishes a sword above his head. By the time he’s done speaking, the crowd is riled up. With a cry of “Floreat Domus de Eliot!” he leaps off the table and charges out the door. We follow him to the yard where we proceed to chant and scream and yell. When the chill begins to creep in we take a lap around the yard. Then we take another. Did I mention it’s cold?
Luckily, we are delivered from imminent hypothermia by the arrival of our HoCo chairs with the letters. They have split them into stacks, which they distribute to the seniors who have been previously designated “Letter Captains.” Cam and I are paired up. We grab our stack and take off at full sprint towards Hurlbut, while a contingent of Eliotites trails behind us whooping and hollering. Our first delivery is a little anticlimactic. We charge around the corner, chanting “E-L-I-O-T. YOU JUST WON THE LOTTERY!” The door is already open and the three guys sitting in the room are surprisingly nonplussed. They stand and give us unenthusiastic high-fives as our yells begin to die out. I hold out the letter and shout the name printed on it and there is no response. Confused, I try a different pronunciation. Still nothing. On my third attempt one of the freshmen reaches out his hand to cut me off. “I guess I can take that.” There is no time to figure out what that was about. We are all too pumped. Someone shouts “Floreat Domus de Eliot” and receives an echo of “Domus!” in return. The horde retreats from the room and advances on Grays.
The second letter doesn’t go smoothly either. We swarm into the room and no one reacts. I look around and see a lot of hopeful faces and half-extended arms. There are too many of them. A quick headcount confirms there are at least two blocking groups in the room. The chanting dies as everyone comes to the same realization. From my perch on top of one of the desks I shout the name on the letter followed by “Welcome to Eliot!” This time the reaction is immediate. Half of the girls start to squeal as they pogo up and down in joy. The disappointment of the other half is visible on their faces. One girl starts to cry. I want to say something to her about how all the houses are great but I’m afraid it will seem disingenuous coming from the guy who seconds before had mistakenly congratulated her on “winning the lottery.” Instead I pretend not to notice as I hand out hugs and high-fives.
After that, we change our modus operandi to avoid any more awkward situations. When we approach the next few doors, we cover the peephole and chant the name on the letter. The rest of the deliveries go smoothly.
When our group has given out all of our letters, we join with the other Eliotites in front of Weld to deliver the final letter. There are hundreds of us, so I am still trying to squeeze my way on to the fourth floor landing when the letter is delivered on the fifth floor. I manage to work my way up the final flight of stairs in time to see the final blocking group beaming from ear to ear in the middle of a sea of blue shirts. Cam gives a speech and then it’s over. The crowd is slow to disperse.
We stroll back to Eliot in little groups, for once ignoring the cold. We’re hugging and sharing stories. We’re trying to make the moment last. I turn to a friend and tell him how much I love Eliot. “Of course you do!” he says. His eyes scan the little clusters of blue shirts walking around us. “Eliot isn’t just a dorm or a building,” he says “Eliot is a group of people. Eliot is a family.”

I awoke at 6 a.m. on March 13 to the hiss of my radiator and the loud, excited chatter of my blockmates in the hallway. It was Housing Day morning, my first as an upperclassman in Cabot House. I debated with myself whether to get up at all, anticipating the faces of freshmen—ranging from (hopefully) indifferent to (probably) teary-eyed—whose fates I would soon deliver.
My blockmates banged on the door, saying that I needed to get up if I wanted a free t-shirt.
Joining them, I walked through the tunnels to the dining hall in slippers. Rounding the corner and passing Cabot Café, the low buzz through the tunnels turned into a roar. The dining hall was teeming with Cabotians painting their faces, donning House gear, and dancing to Pharrell.
Our House Masters, our resident dean, and their children were there handing out breakfast food and Cabot tattoos. The mood was infectious. I finally felt like I was allowed to feel House pride. My friends and I painted faces, snapped silly photos, and got psyched up to storm the Yard.
At exactly 7 a.m., the Cabot army trekked through the fresh coating of snow to the Yard. Impressed by the turnout, I forgot the cold as we chanted and clapped. Cabot was the second house to reach the John Harvard Statue, with only Kirkland arriving earlier. Considering we had walked from the Quad, it was pretty impressive.
A Cabot tricyclist with a boombox in tow pumped tunes into the crowd, and Kirkland and Cabot exchanged some friendly-competitive chants. (Kirkland quickly quieted when we started shouting “n+1!”) As other Houses filled the Yard, the scene got more festive, as well as more confusing (what was Sigma Chi doing there?). The Yard rang with the cacophony of students’ cheers and the clicking of tourists’ cameras.
Cabot’s anthem morphed to “Dean Rakesh!”, and the man himself was quickly hoisted on a Cabotian’s shoulders. I soon realized that the Cabot flag had been strung up from University Hall.
All of a sudden, hordes of students sprinted away in various directions. I followed the bobbing crowd of red and yellow as it streamed into Holworthy. There were so many of us that I couldn’t shoulder my way to the front of the group and see the first blocking group’s reactions. As suddenly as it had started, we were sprinting off to another dorm.
Eventually splitting into two smaller groups, I was finally able to see some of the freshmen. It was better than I expected—the freshmen we took and showered with Swedish Fish wore at worst blank faces and at best smiles as they donned their Cabot tanks and sweatbands. Now, they weren’t yelling with joy, but they seemed at least mildly excited, something I took as a win.  Only one room of freshmen, a larger blocking group of girls, cried that day when we arrived. While it was disappointing to see—after all, they had no idea what Cabot is actually like—we shook it off and moved on.
As we filed out of our last dorm back into the snow, the juniors and seniors chattered, celebrating that only one blocking group had cried this year. I had to admit, I was frustrated with those girls. They were totally ignorant about the Quad, I told myself. They would love it—or, at the very least, they would adjust.
It’s a shame how holistically the Harvard community buys into Quad-hating. My upperclassmen River friends were the first to tell me that they felt bad for me upon hearing my housing assignment and how transferring was always an option. Even now, I find myself modifying my statements, minimizing my love of my House.
Instead of telling people about our welcoming community, about seeing my House  Masters at the Donkey Show, about the convenience of shuttles every 10 minutes (especially the ones that go straight to Northwest Labs), about n+1 housing, and about having actual grass at my doorstep, I qualify, understate, mitigate. “It’s not that bad,” I find myself saying to my friends, “it grows on you.”
Why isn’t Cabot, or the Quad in general, something to be excited about? Why do people laugh when I say I have House pride? Arguments in favor of the Quad seem forced, tired and quickly dismissed by the more proximate majority. “But, River,” they say. “Location.” “Lunch.”
To those people I want to say: But natural sunlight. But n+1. But Cabot Café. But Dean Rakesh.
As our beloved House Master once said: No Cabot, No America.
Welcome to the family, new fish.

It was March 11, and by 2 p.m. the temperature had reached a scorching 55. The ice on the ground had turned to puddles, the birds were chirping, and the flowers were practically bursting into bloom. We suspected that Cambridge runners would be emerging from their own basement-gym hibernations and migrating back to their natural habitat: the six mile loop around the Charles.
Eager to tan our faces and get some exercise of our own, we decided to join these joggers and interview them on the go. Were they excited to finally run outside?, we wondered, and what had they been doing all winter? After all, we sure hadn’t been braving the glacial Cambridge tundra.
We first came upon two Harvard Law School students.
“Is this your first day running outside in a while?” we asked.
“No. We’ve been doing it all winter.”
“How far are you guys going?” we panted.
“I think about eight miles.”
At that point we decided it might be a good idea to peel off.
Next, we ran with another pair of graduate students, Sarah E. Reynolds and Becky Sager, and their dog, Duke.
We tried again: “This your first time outside in a while?”
“No, we do it everyday.” Reynolds, or maybe Sager, though definitely not the dog, replied.
“Six miles every day,” the other human responded. “Keeps us sane.”
With that, we decided to hunt down some easier prey: Steve P. Harrman, an older man in a beanie jogging slowly. Surely, his muscles were just now waking up from a long hibernation.
Wrong again. He’d been training for a half marathon throughout February, though he’d taken January off.
“Is this your assignment, or do you run too?” he asked, as if we somehow didn’t pass as grad students on our daily six-to-eight mile loop.
Our prides bruised, we left Steve to what we’re sure was a mediocre jog (he was listening to Bob Marley after all) and spotted our first Harvard undergrad. After a painful sprint, we managed to catch Kani I. David ’16 amidst his own marathon training and engrossed in a Shakira and Rihanna collaboration. We kept up with him for a solid five minutes, and, at a solid 8:30 mile pace (we asked), we were pretty impressed with ourselves.
Together, we turned onto Memorial Bridge, where David dashed through a red light and, in the name of journalism, we had no choice but to follow.
“Do you always jaywalk?” we asked.
“I try to obey...but if there’s no cars coming, I mean, as long as it’s safe,” he responded.
Probably not safe, but running with a newborn didn’t seem much better. We spotted Chris O’Brien pushing a three-month old baby in a stroller along the Charles.
“[My wife and I] run a lot of the local 5k, 10k; they’re stroller friendly,” he explained,  “You start in the back.”
His wife, a graduate of Harvard Medical school, had done her last 5k at seven months pregnant.
It seemed like everyone, even the newly born, had been running through the winter. Theory disproved, miles (assumably) run, we stopped harassing Cambridge runners and let them enjoy the rare sun in silence (or listening to Bob Marley, or Shakira).
After all, it was a little too hot to keep running. Plus, one of us really had to pee.

Hey B.J., née Benjamin Joseph, Novak ’01. Guess what? I look just like you. Seriously, I look just fucking like you. Same hair (Br.). Same height (5’9”). Same muscle build (N/A). And then those eyes…. Do people get lost in your eyes, which vary in pigment depending on what we’re wearing, the same way they do mine? Face-to-face, I suppose, we wouldn’t exactly reflect—my jaw is broader—but I’d challenge anyone to find someone who could better refract you and your wonk-lipped fizzog—our wonk-lipped fizzog. It’s not the overall face, just certain features, I think. A part that evokes a whole, like when you hear the lick of a song and it reminds you of a totally different song because of some backbeat you can’t quite put your finger on unless you’re a trained musician, which anyone who saw “Saving Mr. Banks” knows you’re not. Nor am I, to be fair. I’m just a Harvard senior with a delusional vendetta against a semi-beloved TV comedian. You also went to Harvard—a nice coincidence. And you lived in Winthrop, as I do now—even nicer. We have so many wonderful things in common, you and I. So it’s too bad then that when we meet I’m going to have to try to kill you—I’m going to have to take your dark freckled arm and break that motherfucker over my own.
I’ll have to break your arm without you noticing, too, given that as my doppelgänger, you’re my exact double in every way—equal in speed, power, and cunning. Hand-to-hand, bearing forth at the same angle and velocity, our met blows would go nuclear like colliding hydrogen atoms: large Hadron-style. At the end of the battle we’d be left with one question: Was it murder or suicide? Understand: This isn’t a death threat; it’s motherfucking prophecy. The Bible tells us when God created the Earth he created two of each person, and that the only way to get to Heaven is to find your clone and destroy him in a violent and bloody manner (John 3:40, maybe). I expect the same aggression from you.
April 2005: Our lives became inexorably linked. The U.S. version of “The Office” premiered with an episode in which you make a bunch of I’m-too-good-for-this faces at the camera (back when your character, Ryan, was considered a relatable, likable guy). From that moment on I’d hear, “You look just like Ryan from ‘The Office’,” almost daily. Goddamn strangers approached me on the street to point out the resemblance, which those fuckers then dared to refer to as “uncanny.” One of my high school teachers actually pulled up the first Christmas episode in the middle of class just to prove it to himself and, for a month, renamed me Ryan, which was too bad for the three actual Ryans in the class, who were then permanently renamed Ri-Guy, Steve, and Ryan II, respectively.
So if my hate for you isn’t already biblically founded, it derives from the sheer spite of having to hear about you nearly every fucking day of the last nine years. My responses have become stock wit: “No actually, he looks like me,” or, “You mean that good looking fellow from TV?” Seriously, have you heard the name of someone you’ve never met over and over and over again? Have you? Have you had your Facebook wall fill up with images of some other guy from film still and gossip articles with taglines like “saw you in a movie last night,” or “lol, how’s Kelly?” I have to witness your smug face—my face—venture across the world without me, like that fucking gnome in that French movie. In the meantime you’ve not heard jackshit about me. That’s not fucking fair, is it? God makes no two snowflakes exactly the same, but then he gets to me and is like “Fuck it, let’s get that dust off that old clay-mold we used for the Novak kid.” My name’s Noah, by the way, fuckface.
The year I went to college at USC, a friend recommended I try using the resemblance to my advantage by trying to pick up L.A. girls by telling them I was your younger brother, Jesse. (That’s your brother’s real name, right? I Wikipedia’d that shit in anticipation of them using iPhones to check my identity, which they almost always did). The idea was that the girl would mention my resemblance, and then my friend would laugh and say something about my brother, i.e., you,  always getting in the way of my game. The modestly-stated celebrity affiliation, we theorized, would woo the co-eds into my freshman dorm room, where I’d seal the deal by claiming ownership of my roommate’s Central Mass. map, point to Newton, and say that’s where us Novak kids grew up and that we should make out. Like shooting fish in a barrel, right?
I want you to know that I owe so many of the weeks (nay, months) of solitary nights my freshman year to you not being an interesting enough celebrity to look like. You know, before you came around I used to be compared to real celebrities—Gyllenhaal, Leto, even John “Manphrodite” Stamos. Once, on the double-decker bus at midnight in London, a sad teenager tried to sell me drugs and asked me if I played Spiderman in the film. Since you’ve stepped into the limelight I’ve gone from Spiderman to B.J. Spiderman to B.J. Needless to say, the transition has been a let down.
A few months ago, you came to Cambridge to do a book talk (I really enjoyed “One More Thing,” by the way). I was too distracted writing a thesis on something more important than “Hamlet” to get tickets (oh yeah, we’ll never forget your “Hamlet” thesis—rosemary for remembrance, bitch). However, when I found out  you were stopping by Winthrop brain break afterwards, I sprinted there, bat and a copy of your book to be autographed in hand, ready for the moment I’ve been anticipating for the last nine years. But I was thwarted: You’d already moved on, and two freshmen came up to ask me for your autograph. You’re real fucking lucky. Back then you had no warning. Now you do. I’m coming, asshole. Sure, we might temporarily set aside our lack of differences and perform a series of hilarious pranks on our friends and family, like those dozens of Disney twins running around causing havoc and pissing off Europeans. But ultimately there can only be one of us. Until then, Mr. Novak, I hunt. And whatever compulsion overcomes us at that sweet moment of encounter—be it to kiss or to vanquish each other—I’ll be prepared.
Noah B. Pisner ’14 is a social studies concentrator in Winthrop House. Like B.J. Novak, he is a comedian and totally joking right now. He’d settle for a cup of coffee with Novak.

Approaching the row of administrators across a wide, mostly empty stage, Abigail W.T.A. Mariam ’15 offers Donald H. Pfister and Rakesh Khurana, interim and rising deans of the College, a mic.
It’s Friday, March 7, about 10 p.m., at a talkback on the opening night of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a play turned viral social media campaign centered around the diverse experiences of black students at Harvard. Mariam is the campaign’s publicity liaison.
“I, Too, Am Harvard,” the artistic brainchild of Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16,  has grown from an independent study project and discussion within the black community to a New York Times-featured movement with campus spin-offs from the University of Iowa to Oxford.
Consisting of big-name professors, students, community members, at least one New York Times reporter, and administrators, the audience has spent the last couple hours laughing, cheering, and, probably, crying at the show. Here for a night of student theater, spectators now watch as the campaign’s student organizers do something unexpected: facing the row of deans, they issue two demands—and request that Pfister and Khurana commit to them.
The demands? “The first thing that we asked for was a formal statement from the President’s Office and the Dean of the College’s Office affirming the place of students of color on Harvard’s campus,” says Tsega Tamene ’15, producer of the show. The second demand: organizers “called for a meeting with administrators by the end of April,” Tamene says.

***
It’s been a big year for organizing by students of color, and particularly black students, on college campuses. From the popularity of the Being Black at the University of Michigan hashtag to the “33” campaign highlighting the underrepresentation of black students at UCLA Law School (33 out of 1,100), discussions about racial dynamics on university campuses have been widely publicized.
And as it so often does, Harvard has become part of the discussion. I, Too, Am Harvard emerges in the context of other student initiatives dealing with race at the College. A recent Latino Town Hall and a resulting task force, seek to address Latino student demands. Meanwhile, black student leaders, independent from I, Too, Am Harvard, have been meeting to discuss their concerns and formulate an action plan. These initiatives have demonstrated student concern with issues of community and administrative support. And they’ve raised the profile of racial issues on campus.
“We touched people’s souls, we touched people’s hearts,” Matsuda-Lawrence says of I, Too, Am Harvard. “So many people on this campus and across America and across the world have been saying to us, ‘You know, I see myself in those stories.”’
And while today’s College is more racially diverse than ever, Matsuda-Lawrence believes these are stories that remain undertold.
According to the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, racial minorities make up a little less than half of the student body: black students at 9.4 percent; Hispanics at 9.6; Asian Americans at 20.2; and Native American and Native Hawaiians at 1.7 and 0.4 percent, respectively. Yet this diversity is a relatively new phenomenon—and the effects of over 200 years of racial exclusion at Harvard remain.
In an era some have dubbed “post-racial,” I, Too, Am Harvard has pointed to the fact that race continues to affect what it means to belong at Harvard. Through its focus on the experiences of black students, it has opened up a space for dialogue about Harvard’s progress towards racial inclusion: where the University has been, and where it still can improve.
To Matsuda-Lawrence, the time for this discussion is now. She references a line from Zora Neale Hurston’s “Their Eyes Were Watching God”: “There are years that ask questions and years that answer.”
Matsuda-Lawrence says: “This is a year that answers.”
AFFIRMATIVE DEBATE
One of the most contentious questions about race and belonging on campus is the role of affirmative action.
On Nov. 2, 2012, The Crimson published “Affirmative Dissatisfaction” by columnist Sarah R. Siskind ’14, a piece questioning the efficacy and fairness of race-based affirmative action as practiced on Harvard’s campus. Siskind envisioned “Affirmative Dissatisfaction” as a discussion-prompting critique of a system she feels does more harm than good.
For many students, however, the article felt like a personal attack challenging their legitimacy at Harvard.
“The reality is that that article made students of color feel unsafe on this campus, feel unwelcome on this campus,” says Tamene. “It did create tension, and this looming feeling of ‘I’m not welcome.’”
As a result of feeling that their place on campus was questioned, Matsuda-Lawrence says, many students, particularly in the black community, felt the need to defend their qualifications.
“We should never have to defend ourselves, we should never have to pull out our SAT scores, our extracurriculars, or all the AP classes we took in high school...to defend our right to be here,” says Matsuda-Lawrence. “White kids never have to do that.”
Yet contrary to the statements of some of her detractors, Siskind says she doesn’t oppose affirmative action because she questions the presence of black students on campus or feels that the goal of diversity is an unworthy one.
“I don’t so much disagree with the stated goals of affirmative action, as I question the efficaciousness of the program itself, and whether it’s beneficial to the minorities it selects,” she says. “There should never be a presumption of inadequacy—that is highly immoral.”
Still, Matsuda-Lawrence says, she feels that the article gave license to those who questioned black students’ qualifications—a charge to which she feels I, Too, Am Harvard responds.
“If that article kind of gave people permission to attack black students on this campus, then this project is giving ourselves permission to speak back to that,” she says.
Long a topic of debate, race-based affirmative action largely targets black, Native American, and Latino students, who are currently underrepresented at institutions of higher education.
Harvard has defended considering race in the admissions process, even as some states have taken action to abolish the policy, and multiple court cases have challenged its constitutionality. In August 2012, Harvard, along with the rest of the Ivy League and peer institutions like the University of Chicago and Stanford, submitted an amicus curiae brief defending the policy in the Supreme Court case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 says that the admissions office considers a wide range of individual and academic attributes in its attempts to admit the best possible class—only one of which is race.
“Our admissions process focuses on individual applicants in a holistic way.  We seek students who will contribute to our educational environment by stimulating and inspiring their fellow classmates and the faculty,” Fitzsimmons wrote in an email.
For Siskind, however, any consideration of race in admissions is bad policy.
“Race-based affirmative action seemed to be an aberration off of otherwise deeply admirable, understandable admissions policy,” Siskind says.
Furthermore, she argues, the policy may prove self-defeating, itself inspiring doubt in underrepresented minority students’ qualifications. “You should not, morally speaking, in any way, shape, or form, assume that somebody was helped by race-based affirmative action,” she says. “That is not to say, however, that is not a common interpretation.”
Siskind says that this possibility—that employers and others will assume that Black, Latino, and Native American applicants are beneficiaries of affirmative action, and stereotype them as less qualified—is part of the reason why she opposes the policy, favoring a socioeconomic model instead.
Siskind is not the only student on campus critical of race-based affirmative action.
Rahsaan K. King ’17 feels that his own experience indicates problems with the policy. A black student who attended a prep school primarily for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, King says he experienced firsthand the backlash against those thought to be beneficiaries of affirmative action. When articles about his admission to Harvard appeared in the Houston Chronicle and the Huffington Post, he says strangers made disparaging comments questioning his qualifications.
“The ostensible intention is to foster equity, to make up for past wrongs, to encourage diversity,” says King about the purpose of race-based affirmative action. “However, I think with that has unintentionally come these externalities where...people assume that students who are prospective recipients are less qualified, and I think that from what we’ve seen it has the minorities frustrated and the white students feeling slighted.”
King also feels that race-based affirmative action in college admissions fails to address a deeper issue: educational inequality.
“The problem is inequity in education before college,” he says. Race-based affirmative action, though well-meaning, he says, fails to address these disparities.
For filmmaker André Robert Lee, affirmative action is a matter of justice. Like King, Lee attended a private secondary school as a black student on scholarship, an experience he details in his documentary film “The Prep School Negro,” which he presented at Harvard last year.
“Look around. Either you think that people of color and women are less, or you think there’s injustice in the world. And there’s no grey line for it, it’s one or the other,” he says. “You believe that there are only a handful of people of color in this school because they are not as smart, they are less, or you think there’s imbalance in the application process, in the systems that are set up in our world.”
IN AND OF HARVARD
While Harvard has become drastically more inclusive in the past hundred years, for many students in the College, racial identity remains a salient factor in social life.
“We don’t live in a post-racial society, period,” says Ade G. Popoola ’15, president of the Black Students Association.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., professor in African and African American Studies and director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, elaborates. “For some people, supposedly we live in, the election of Barack Obama spelled, the end of racism, the post-racial America, which is a ridiculous idea,” he says. “You can’t reverse three centuries of slavery and a century of Jim Crow segregation with the election of a black man.”
Yet despite the continued effect of race on students’ lives, says Matsuda-Lawrence, “Most of the time on campus, in America, in the world, race is a pretty taboo subject.”
Nevertheless, students point to very real tensions.
“I continue to meet with students on a regular basis who express concern to me about how they’re made to feel marginalized or how they’re made to feel in Harvard but not of it,” says neurology professor S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. “Just to hear our students say that today really concerns me.”
Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16 is one of those students. “This is a problem that is pervasive in this college: this sense of alienation, of isolation, of not feeling like you belong,” she says.
Co-director of Harvard Dialogues, formerly known as Sustained Dialogue, Wigglesworth focuses her extracurricular work on promoting active conversations around various forms of identity and power on campus. And personally, she says, race is a subject that hits home—and often hurts.
Wigglesworth cites personal experience of having her legitimacy as a student doubted: in several cases, she says, her ID has been checked by staff explicitly questioning her status at the College. She says she feels this is directly related to her identity as a black student.
“You can’t tell me that racial profiling is not something that black students have to go through on this campus,” Wigglesworth says.
The issue of racial profiling has long affected social life at the College. In 2007, HUPD officers asked a group of Black Men’s Forum and Association of Black Harvard Women members enjoying a yearly gathering on the Quad to offer proof of identification. The officers had been called by students who questioned whether the picnickers went to Harvard. Many at the time thought this doubt was racialized; Wigglesworth, at least, thinks similar dynamics persist.
The Quad was home to a disproportionate number of black students under the old ranked-choice housing system, abolished to increase House diversity in 1995.
Farai Chideya ’90, a journalist who wrote a Washington Post response to I, Too, Am Harvard about her own experience of race at the College, says that this concentration of black students prompted accusations of self-segregation—a charge that affects student social life to this day.
“A lot of black students ended up living in the Quad. Some people call that self-segregation, but I don’t like that term at all,” Chideya says. This kind of social grouping by race, she argues, is often an effect of discrimination. “When you go through those kinds of things, you might say, well, I just don’t really trust that I’m going to be in a majority culture and be treated with respect.”
Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15, president of the Black Men’s Forum, objects to the way he thinks discussions about self-segregation often put the onus of the issue onto black students.
“I think the question I would prefer asking instead of ‘why are all the black students sitting together’ is ‘why are all the white students sitting together,’” he says.
King sees self-segregation as understandable, yet stymying exchange.
“People gravitate to commonality,” he says. “I think it’s logical, and rational, and makes sense.” Still, he says, “Self-segregation unintentionally stifles diversity.”
Overall, says Chideya, choice of social group can be a strategy in navigating sometimes-thorny racial terrain.
“It’s not irrational to think that there’s racism in America, because it’s documented,” she says. “The question is, what’s your strategy?”
IN THE CLASSROOM
Race doesn’t only affect students in admissions and social life. It also affects learning—from peers and from professors, from the classroom to the common room.
Head of the popular course Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality 1168: “Education, Race, Gender in the United States” professor Chiwen Bao both studies how race and other forms of identity affect learning, and witnesses these dynamic play out in class.
When discussing race in academic settings, Bao says, students’ own identities often comes into play—and the results, while often productive, can be tense.
“There are a lot of emotions—there’s a lot of guilt, there’s a lot of anger,” says Bao. “When those kinds of emotions come up, we need to address them or else they just become assumptions and ideas about each other and misunderstandings that are perpetuated.”
For Roberts, race doesn’t just come up as a topic of classroom discussion: it affects how comfortable he feels speaking in class.
“You want to ask a question in section, but you’re hesitant,” Roberts says. “You don’t want to give a stupid answer, because the first thing that people see is sadly the color of your skin.”
According to Roberts, this pressure has affected him differently across time: while it limited him as a freshman and sophomore, he says, now that he’s in advanced neurobiology classes, “I speak up pretty much every class, because I refuse to let that teacher think that I’m not capable.”
Amanda D. Bradley ’15, president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, points to socioeconomic background as another vector of identity affecting classroom interactions.
Race and class can pose a dual challenge for students of color who attended secondary schools in impoverished areas.
“Coming from an all black-dominated area or a poor black school, that’s a class issue, that’s a class and race issue,” says Bradley.
That’s also a question of preparation: while many students of color come from well-supported secondary schools, those who don’t may, like their white peers from similar backgrounds, face difficulties both personally and academically.
While both Bradley and Roberts cite cultural groups like BMF and ABHW as providing members with academic and personal mentorship, Bradley wishes there were more institutional outreach to students who may be having a difficult time at the College.
Harvard has a number of resources for academic support, and resources to navigate these resources. Yet, says Bradley, access can come down to individual student comfort level.
“The resources are there, it’s just a question of whether or not people feel that it’s an open space and whether or not it’s a safe space,” she says. “That isn’t to say that everybody’s mentor has to be the same race that they are or the same socioeconomic background, but sometimes it helps.”
Bao, for one, uses strategies like required office hours to engage students who may be hesitant to approach her.
Roberts also points to the importance of faculty diversity in encouraging students of color to feel comfortable in the classroom. Faculty diversity, however, has yet to keep pace with that of the student body: as of the 2013-2014 Faculty Development and Diversity Annual Report, 82.5 and 74 percent of tenured and tenure track faculty, respectively, are white.
Above all, learning both in and outside of the classroom shares a common theme: how can community members learn from each other, but not at each others’ expense?
“We have to educate each other about the ways that we wound each other, the ways in which unwittingly things said unconsciously can inflict pain,” says Gates.
Yet this learning requires a measure of vulnerability.
“Something has to give,” says Aubrey J. Walker ’15, who facilitates discussions about identity as a leader at the Freshman Urban Program. “Someone has to make themselves very vulnerable for someone else to learn. And because of this problem itself, that’s very much what people don’t want to do.”
In light of this vulnerability, Lee, the filmmaker who created “The Prep School Negro,” suggests an alternate model for dialogue—one in which students educate themselves about experiences that are not their own.
“When it comes to conversations around privilege and the like, I think we need to put the onus on the people who benefit and exist in it to take on the responsibility.”
COMMUNITY, CONVERSATION
Harvard College doesn’t have a core curriculum, but there is one text most current undergraduates have read: “Whistling Vivaldi,” written by Claude M. Steele, a piece about stereotypes surrounding black identity. It’s been assigned to the past several classes of incoming freshmen as part of Community Conversations, a facilitated discussion during freshman orientation designed to inspire conversation about race, gender, class, and other forms of identity.
Community Conversations is one of several resources available at the College for this kind of education.
“Community Conversations has, I think, tried to make students aware of the richness of the diversity in the class,” says Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “It isn’t just about how do we get along in Straus B, but it’s about engaging in a responsible way civically.”
Beyond this initiative, incoming students who participate in the Freshman Urban Program, a week-long pre-orientation program dedicated to social justice and community service, are engaged in discussions about identity and inclusion.
Every year right before Opening Days, FUP leaders set out upon a mission of disorientation. They take students on a “Disorientation Tour” intended to highlight Harvard’s less-told histories, including sometimes-difficult histories of race.
“I would honestly make that a requirement for every student,” says Walker, a FUP leader, of the tour. “Three hundred seventy-five years—there’s a lot we can unpack, there’s a lot we can learn about ourselves.”
After orientation, one significant resource for  conversation related to race and culture on campus is the Harvard Foundation.
“The Foundation’s role is to help our students not be distracted by issues of race and culture while they’re here at Harvard,” says Counter, the Foundation’s director. “You should be able to go through, do your work, feel great pride in your cultural background, but not be distracted because someone is minimizing the value of your culture.”
Counter has served as director since the origins of the Foundation in 1981, when a committee including then-President Derek Bok and Reverend Peter J. Gomes opted for this intercultural model, as opposed to the Third World center of Princeton, or Yale’s various cultural centers.
The Foundation, which employs 16 student interns, provides funding for student cultural groups.
Maya P. Dorje ’15 is an intern at the Foundation and co-chair of its Student Advisory Committee, which oversees the allocation of grants to about 80 different cultural groups. The committee meets with cultural group representatives every month, providing a space, Dorje says, to address their concerns.
“To me, it’s about supporting students from different cultural groups, not only with resources, not only with funding, but as a venue for advocacy,” Dorje says of the committee.
However, both she and Counter indicate that the Foundation’s current budget falls short of enabling it to fund many of the projects that come the committee’s way. While the Student Advisory Committee received requests for $64,000 from cultural groups in spring 2014, its available grant money is $25,000 a semester, says Dorje. The Foundation’s last funding increase was in 2006.
Dorje says that in addition to funding, cultural groups also express the desire for designated meeting space.
“Space is power, space is legitimation, space is validation,” she says. “I think that racial dialogue can and does still happen on campus with the current level of funding and space available, however I do think that space and funding constrain the efforts and work of many cultural groups on campus.”
Popoola of the Black Students Association feels that this limit in funding affects the BSA. “Harvard really talks about diversity as a big selling point of their College, but the fact that they’re not really feeding into the diversity that they’re bringing into the College is really unfortunate,” she says. “I think there also needs to be something met financially.”
One potential step in approaching cultural groups’ concerns, says Dorje, is the Student Advisory Committee’s upcoming April meeting—which will be attended, upon student invitation, by University President Drew G. Faust.
Herbert B. Castillo ’14, an organizer of the LatinX Town Hall meeting, also points to funding concerns as one potential aspect of his group’s initiative. Castillo is part of the Latino Task Force, a group of upwards of 40 students formed in the wake of the Town Hall to advance the concerns of Latino students on campus. Their first task, says Castillo, is to administer a survey that will gauge how students feel about the racial climate and support network at Harvard.
One component of the campaign, Castillo says, centers around administrative responsiveness: while the Office of Student Life reached out to the Latino Task Force in the wake of the Town Hall, Castillo says he wishes the administrative approach to minority student needs was more proactive.
While some students disagree that increased administrative action is an appropriate or necessary measure in addressing issues of race on campus, rising dean Khurana emphasizes the need for both structural and community approaches.
“Leaders can set a tone of respecting the rights, differences, and dignity of each member of our community,” Khurana wrote in an emailed statement. “But much more is needed. As the [I, Too, Am Harvard] production and students point out, our entire community—students, faculty, staff—all have a leadership role to play in creating an atmosphere that encourages understanding and inclusion towards the ends of mutual learning and respecting the dignity of each person on this campus.”
Dingman indicates that there is space for improvement, referring back to Community Conversations.
“Could we do more? Yes, we sure could,” he says.
Dingman cites the recent effort to include upperclassmen co-moderators in Community Conversations as one such improvement.
While acknowledging the limits of Community Conversations as just one of many tools in advancing a climate of racial inclusion at the College, Dingman hopes that the initiative can at least inspire further dialogue.
“What we’re doing frankly is pretty superficial,” he says. “It’s only an hour and a half. But we hope we’re planting seeds, we hope that the conversation will continue.”
DIALOGIC
“Can you read?”
“Having an opinion does not make me an ‘Angry Black Woman.’”
“You’re not blacker than me because you can rap more Jay-Z lyrics.”
“You’re dressed like you might shoot me right now—such a thug.”
“You’re lucky to be black—so easy to get into college.”
“Oh, I heard her say she was going to Harvard—I just assumed she misspoke.”
“No, I will not teach you how to Twerk.”
“I was in Harvard but not of it.”
The statements above come from opposite ends of a century of change. The first seven, part of I, Too, Am Harvard’s popular social media campaign, are racial microagressions—defined as brief instances of often-unintentional racial denigration—written on signs held up by students. The last is from W.E.B. Du Bois, noted scholar, activist, and member of the Harvard Class of 1890.
While Harvard’s record of racial inclusion has drastically improved in the intervening century—from allocation of substandard housing to black students in the early twentieth century to unwanted comments about twerking—for many the feeling of being “in but not of” Harvard persists through these experiences of microaggression.
Faced with this, says Gates, students must engage in new kinds of dialogue.
“We need to educate each other at this new level of sensitivity,” he says.
For Siskind, the conversations she’s had with opponents and supporters since the release of “Affirmative Dissatisfaction” have reaffirmed the importance of interpersonal engagement around the issue of race.
“I’m very much persuaded of dialogue being the preferred medium for these kinds of discussions,” she says. “Every time I’ve had coffee with people in the years since I’ve written the article, it has invariably been productive.”
Meanwhile, students continue to engage in advocacy and community building from a number of fronts. An upcoming town hall meeting organized by black and Latino student leaders, says Castillo, will focus on three goals: faculty and staff diversity; programming and policy; and increased resources.
“We are very aware that the same issues that we face as a Latino community are faced by other racial minorities on campus,” says Castillo. “We’re working toward a common goal.”
And Pfister and Khurana, at least, have taken up I, Too, Am Harvard’s second demand, arranging an upcoming meeting with campaign representatives.
Tamene says there remains work to be done. “This is a call to action to Harvard to live up to everything that it can and should be,” she says.
For Wigglesworth, this call to action is not the result of resentment toward Harvard, but commitment to its progress.
“The reason why I criticize Harvard so much—and the reason why I do so much work with Harvard Dialogoues to make Harvard better—is because I care about this school,” she says. “Not because I don’t like it, not because I don’t want to be here, not because I’m ungrateful. It’s because I care.”

Settled in an armchair and mutely dressed in a grey fleece half-zip and black jeans, Herbert “Herbie” J. Hancock, the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry, exuded pure calmness. The legendary jazz pianist, known for leading fearless, searching electric and acoustic projects (Head Hunters, Mwandishi, his Trio) as well as his tenure with Miles Davis’s seminal “Second Great Quintet” in the ’60s, was charmingly low-key but coolly energetic. Hancock, who turns 75 next month, showed absolutely no sign of his age, save for when he stood up and a slight paunch quietly emerged.
Over the course of a half hour, we talked about his thoughts on the lectures, the epistemic status of the word “jazz,” the difference between composing and improvising, his feelings about being named the first African-American Norton lecturer, and his impression of the Harvard scene.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you find the process of writing these lectures?
Herbie Hancock: Well, I’ve been working on them for almost six months. I’ve been working with a woman who has written speeches for me before over the past few years. The majority of them were for functions having to do with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz; some were for keynote addresses for graduating classes, and there were some cases of me receiving an honorary doctorate or something like that.
In a lot of cases, she did interviews with me and she would just take my words and my ideas and perfect the construction of them, and that’s kind of how we worked on these lectures. Over the years she’s learned a lot about how I think, my style—more than how I express myself: how I feel about things. She knows I’m Buddhist, and there are certain ways I look at things that have to do with my perspective because of my practice of Buddhism. As a result, she’s learned a lot about that perspective; as a matter of fact, she is now interested in Buddhism! *laughs*
THC: How do you think about the relationship between composition and improvisation? Do you think there’s a difference between the two?
HH: Yeah, for me there is. Improvisation is composition—it’s spontaneous composition—but it’s without consideration of any time except the moment, whereas what we call composition is done at a particular time, but you’re not restricted to the moment. There’s a kind of unconscious realization that composition is purposely structured for continuous play, or listening. I mean, you’re not conscious of it in those concrete, detailed terms at the time that you’re composing, but inherently you hope that people are going to want to hear it over and over again! *laughs*
THC: It seems that jazz is gaining respect within higher institutions of learning, since improvisation isn’t necessarily being thought of as below composition, as it sometimes has been in classical music departments.
HH: I hear people say things to me—people from the classical world (not necessarily here, I don’t think they’d necessarily say it to my face)—but they say stuff like, “Oh, I hear you’re getting back into classical music!” They say it with such glee, you know! “Oh, you’re coming back into the real, fine art of classical music,” as though jazz isn’t, and that just goes in one ear and out the other.
I don’t pay attention to that because I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the art of improvisation—especially jazz, because it has solid roots that come from the people, come from ordinary people, and it’s not stuck in any attempt to aspire to some kind of hierarchical placement. The only hierarchy is within the individual musician himself: to become better, that’s all.
THC: Before your first lecture, you went into why you chose the word “Ethics,” but I was also curious about the word “Jazz,” since the term has come under fire in recent years. Do you have an opinion on that whole debate? What does the word “jazz” mean to you?
HH: Well, I do have a perspective on that: we can make jazz mean anything we want it to mean. I’m not so concerned about changing the word as I am about defining, by our behavior and by our focus on establishing a meaning in the eyes of the public, a music that’s one of respect and one that’s worthy of adoration.
THC: Hence initiatives like International Jazz Day.
HH: I mean, you don’t have to change the word! To me, that’s like—I don’t know why this popped into my head—but a guy that gets married to one woman, divorces her and marries another one, divorces her and marries another one, and now, he’s got five wives and a big alimony.
This is a very broad and dangerous generalization to make, but, in general, I think in a lot of cases the fault isn’t the wife or the marriage itself—it’s how you perceive the relationship and the stuff that you throw into the relationship that destroys it! It’s more that you have to deal with yourself; that’s kind of where I’m at. It’s up to us to define what jazz is.
THC: At the first lecture, I was surprised when Professor Homi Bhabha announced that you are the first African-American Norton Professor of Poetry. Was that a surprise to you?
HH: Yeah, it was a surprise to me. On one hand, I felt honored; on the other hand, I felt like, “This is 2014 and you never had any other black Norton professor? Like, what’s wrong with you, Harvard?” *laughs*
Well, Homi Bhabha said the same thing, like, “Well, what took them so long?” But I’ve moved past that. Next! That’s how I felt: “What took you so long,” “Okay, next,” and now you’re past it, so that’s good.
THC: This is a bit of nerdy question, but there’s a story about the infamous 1965 Live at the Plugged Nickel recordings that drummer Tony Williams, on a plane to Chicago, suggested that you and the rest of Miles Davis’s band play “anti-music.” Is that a true story?
HH: Yeah, that’s true. Well, we didn’t know anything about them recording. What had happened was that we got so good at being able to make the music work—to make it happen—because we kind of knew what each one was going to do based off of what each one was going to play. It just became too comfortable and, to us, it was like stagnation. We had grown to the point where we could do that. Now, what’s next? We needed to push the envelope in some kind of way. It was the idea that came from Tony, but as soon as he said it, I totally agreed with him. We needed to break the rules and play against everything we had done before. The idea was: whatever somebody expects you to do at a certain musical idea, do the opposite.
THC: Did you tell Miles?
HH: No! *laughs*
THC: But he caught on.
HH: He never said one word. He never said one word. But one thing we knew was that Miles always told us to always be working on something, and this was working on something. But the worst thing was, we walk into the Plugged Nickel and we see a bunch of tape recorders! We didn’t know we were going to be recorded and we were like, “Oh…we decided to do anti-music on the day we’re going to record, so maybe we shouldn’t do this…maybe after the record.”
But we kind of made that vow—almost in blood!—so we gritted our teeth and we said, “We’re going to do it now,” because otherwise it was like now or never. I think inside we were thinking, “Okay, the idea came, so we better do this idea while it’s hot instead of being swayed,” so we did.
And after the first night they said, “You want to hear some of the tapes back?” Well, none of us wanted to hear anything back because we thought it was awful. We knew that this was like growing pains or something, and we didn’t expect it to sound like anything, you know.
THC: Did you ever end up listening to it?
HH: It was I guess months later; they didn’t put the record out for a while. I read that they had put one out—this was before they did the whole collection—and I didn’t want to hear it. Somebody called me up and said, “Have you heard the stuff you guys did at the Plugged Nickel?” and I said, “No, and I don’t want to, either!” So whoever called me—I don’t remember—they said, “I think you should listen to it.” And I said, “Why? You know, that stuff is really bad.” And he said, “No, I think you should listen to it.” And then I listened to this record...and it sounded really raw, and there was a certain honesty in the rawness that I was happy about, and everything wasn’t perfect and all—the i’s weren’t dotted and the t’s weren’t crossed - but...
THC: But the spirit was there.
HH: Yeah. And Wayne was killing! And Miles, too, and Tony, and…I mean, there were things in there—not moment to moment, but just in general. It’s not my finest piano playing, but it’s all searching, you know, and it had a value that I never expected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 27, 2014, at 12:29 a.m.
For the nearly 30,000 high school seniors who applied regular decision to Harvard’s Class of 2018, the number of unread emails in their inboxes will inconspicuously jump by one Thursday afternoon. After three months of anticipation, applicants to Harvard will click on an email which contains either congratulations or apologies.
But while their peers are anxiously watching their inboxes, 992 students have already received the golden ticket of admission through Harvard’s restrictive early action program. Those 992 students—the highest number admitted early in the last six early admissions cycles—represent about half of the approximately 2,000 students who will be admitted to the Class of 2018, based on analysis of admissions results from previous years.
With more students applying and being accepted early, admissions counselors and experts say that the admissions process has been pushed earlier and earlier for many students in recent years.
“The admissions process is really beginning at age 15 in a lot of instances, instead of age 17,” Steven R. Goodman, an educational consultant and admissions strategist, said in an interview. “In light of this, students need to visit colleges early in order to be prepared earlier.”
While early birds are catching many acceptances, college counselors and students alike view the climate of early acceptance programs with ambivalence. Some say the programs can give students a beneficial head start, but others say they merely increase pressures and force certain demographics out of the ivy-covered gates.
THE RETURN OF THE EARLY BIRD APPLICANT
Prompted by the rationale that early acceptance policies tended to disadvantage students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid eliminated the early action option for applications to the Class of 2012. The University of Virginia and Princeton University followed suit shortly thereafter and eliminated their early action programs.
 
At the time of the announcement in 2006, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said the University would re-evaluate its admissions processes at the end of each admissions cycle and how they affected the demographics of the applicant pool.
In 2011, after a similar review, Harvard, along with the University of Virginia and Princeton, announced that the early action option would return for students applying to the Class of 2016.
“We looked carefully at trends in Harvard admissions these past years and saw that many highly talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement at the time.
This year, applicants to the Class of 2018 represented the third early action pool since its reinstatement in 2011. Though the number of early applicants was slightly fewer than last year, the number admitted rose by just over 100, from 885 to 992.
High school students and admissions officers, noticing that a large portion of college acceptances are delivered early, note that early admission and decision programs, both old and reinstated, create pressures to begin college searches earlier.
INSIDE THE MIND OF THE CONTEMPORARY EARLY BIRD
When Bryan T. Stromer, a graduate of the the New York City Lab School for Collaborative Studies and current freshman at Vanderbilt, started his college search, he noticed pressure among top students to apply early. Although Stromer said that his school sent students to a variety of places, the students applying to elite universities often felt a stronger push to apply early.
“The people applying to [elite universities] felt pressure to apply early just because how competitive it is to get into those...and with the lower rank schools, people felt they could wait,” Stromer said.
Stromer, who chronicled his admissions process on The Choice blog for The New York Times, added that many students felt that applying early offered them an opportunity to be viewed in more depth by admissions officers than if they were to apply regular in a pool of tens of thousands of students.
 
“Just logistically, the early application is always less than the regular admissions pool, but it’s the same number of staff looking [at applications],” Stromer said. “If you ask the admissions counselor they will probably say no, but it makes sense to me that they would have more time per application to review [early].”
 
High School admissions counselors and experts said that they observed a similar sentiment among students they advise.
 
Kristen A. Learner, the director of college counseling at The Benjamin School in North Palm Beach, Fla., said that her staff tries to get to know students early on and start the discussion sooner rather than later to ensure students can apply to a school they feel is the “right fit.”
 
“At a college preparatory school where 100 percent of students go to college, the conversation is there early on,” said Learner, adding that she encourages students to apply when they “put their best foot forward,” whether that be early or regular.
 
Jeffrey Wong, another counselor at The Benjamin School and former admissions offer at Brandeis University, said that it is evident that many schools have higher acceptance rates during their early programs than during their regular programs.
 
“We are not going to lie to them when we see schools that have drastically different acceptances rates for early decision or regular,” Wong said.
 
Learner noted that at The Benjamin School nearly a third of students will apply early decision to a college, and well over half the class will apply under some type of early program.
 
Goodman said the push for students to start applications earlier affects Harvard, even though the University uses a single choice early action program, under which a student may not apply to another college but is not bound to matriculate to Harvard.
 
“If everybody is preparing earlier, then that changes the landscape for everybody, including Harvard,” Goodman said.
 
ROOM LEFT IN THE ADMISSIONS NEST
Fitzsimmons said that although there are generally still some differences demographically between the type of students applying early versus those who apply regular decision, the diversity of the early pool is becoming more diverse.
“While our early pool is still not representative of the rest of what the class is going to look like, it’s certainly more so than was the case in the past,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview.
Addressing concerns that the regular admissions rate is far lower than the early admissions rate, Fitzsimmons said that students have the same chance of getting in no matter the time they apply and will receive the same thorough review of their applications during both processes. In addition, he noted that the early action pool is a generally stronger academically and extracurricularly.
While this year saw 992 early acceptances, Fitzsimmons said that his office has always been careful and conservative about early admissions decisions.
“It would be foolish, for a [college] to admit [students early] and not leave enough space for terrific kids,” Fitzsimmons said.
Gay S. Pepper, former associate dean of admission at the University of Pennsylvania and current college counselor, said that she applauds Harvard’s early action program as a “godsend for kids.”
She also said that she was sure Harvard was mindful of the types of students applying regular and would reserve sufficient spaces.
“I think that the colleges know the kind of underserved students who may have greater potential than say a student at a private school...is probably going to be applying regular decision,” said Pepper. “So the colleges want to make sure they have plenty of space in their incoming class for these very talented kids.”
In the end, Pepper said that the non-binding early admissions programs are “pro-student” because they avoid the permanency that comes with early decision. Pepper advises students against applying early based only pressures, such as admissions rate comparisons, when they may not have finished their college search.
“[Students who are] gaming the system and not making good educational choices are not necessarily happy with their decisions,” Pepper said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although members of the Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program might be completely unknown to the incoming freshmen who first see them at study breaks during Opening Days, the REPs are hard at work. Equipped with reusable plastic mugs, smoothies, and stickers, the student activists educate freshmen, playing a small part in a decades-long struggle for sustainability.
Efforts by students and staff over the past 25 years have drastically cut the amount of trash each person at Harvard outputs annually, but administrators and undergraduates alike agree that more can be done.
In 1989, the average person attending or working at Harvard outputted over 770 pounds of trash annually. Despite a population increase of over 30 percent at Harvard and large real estate expansions in intervening years, by 2013 that number was cut by more than half, with yearly trash output per capita falling to 365 pounds.
Yet, while trash tonnage has plummeted and recycling rates have bolstered, the story is not that simple. In the past five years, the average trash per capita has fluctuated in both directions, with the lowest number being posted in 2011. Harvard, it seems, has hit a efficiency barrier tough to move beyond.
With difficulties stemming from organization, implementation, and communication, those striving to push green efforts at Harvard are working to find new methods that can make the University more waste-efficient and inspire students to serve as means to this end.
WHERE DID IT ALL GO? 
In the 1980s, Robert M. Gogan Jr. was completing a graduate program at the School of Education when he decided to direct his attention to addressing waste reduction and recycling at Harvard.
“I thought Harvard was doing a lousy job back in 1986,” Gogan, who now serves as the associate manager of recycling and waste management for Facilities Maintenance Operations, candidly admitted more than two decades later.
On an otherwise uneventful December day, Gogan spoke about various partnerships and policies that have contributed to reducing trash output.
“Our first goal, of course, is to reduce waste,” he said.
While single stream recycling, which Harvard switched to in 2006, made it much easier for students to recycle, according to Gogan, collaboration has also been crucial in reducing waste
He mentioned one such partnership with a company that collected items from the University for use in Haiti, Uganda, and Michigan.
 
In addition to negotiating zero-waste contracts with distributors, Gogan said partnering with student groups has contributed to the increase in recycling efforts.
The Harvard Habit for Humanity group, which has held a sale of used dorm items and books in the fall for almost two decades, is just one example of the numerous ways in which administrators try to work with students, he said.
Jaclyn Olsen, assistant director of the Office for Sustainability, attributed improvement in recycling to similar efforts, but said that a change in culture awareness has also played a part.
“I really think it’s been a big culture change,” Olsen said of students who have grown more environmentally conscious.
Still, both Gogan and Olsen talk about the challenges they face in reaching out to students and bringing the numbers down.
AS EASY AS THROWING IT AWAY
No city or community conducts recycling operations in the same manner, and with students from across the world arriving at Harvard every year, environmental educators have to play a catch-up game, said Samantha L. Houston ’11, REP coordinator and a former Eco REP.
The REP program was founded in 2002 after three students from the Environmental Action Committee proposed that undergraduates play a role in education and advocacy of green initiatives.
“[REPs] are basically ambassadors for all the issues,” Houston said.
With one REP per upperclassmen House, three to the freshman class, and a handful of captains, the group educates students on Harvard’s recycling and compost policies.
“You are constantly having to re-cultivate the knowledge base,” Houston said.
Kristen J. Wraith ’14, who was an Eco REP for three years and former EAC Chair, spoke about a recycling game she helped coordinate each year, where students were asked which of various items should be recycled and which should be thrown into the trash.
“One of the things that we’re always shocked about is that people tend to throw away most things,” Wraith said.
In addition to simply educating, Wraith emphasized the importance of teaching students why recycling matters.
Undergraduates care greatly about convenience, Wraith added.
“If there’s any effort involved, even like three feet of movement involved in recycling, some people are just going to keep on their way and trash something that might be recyclable,” echoed Houston.
As a result, Wraith said that rallying students behind a cause is not easy.
“If you are trying to change someone’s lifestyle…people are furious about that,” she said.
And even when large groups of students support an initiative, lack of communication between groups can sometimes add to the challenge.
FIFTY SHADES OF GREEN
“The University is really decentralized,” Olsen said.
With many groups working on specific issues tailored towards different schools, infrastructures, or environments, what works in one place does not always work in another.
“You need and want to respect each culture of the place,” sustainability communications Ddirector Colin B. Durrant said.
 
While the OFS oversees many green efforts beyond recycling, student groups often focus on disparate sustainability goals, such as Divest Harvard or the Beyond the Bottle Campaign.
 
For some, the decentralization on the student side is not necessarily a bad thing, though.
“I think [decentralization] is not a problem in any case because there are so many issues that we’re dealing [with],” said Akshay Sharma ’14, an Eco REP captain.
Wraith, on the other hand, called the current decentralization of environmental groups “a blessing and a curse.”
Wraith said that she has seen a “massive growth” of smaller student organizations centered on environmental issues in the past three years. Whereas the EAC was larger and more centralized in the past, Wraith said smaller groups “have not been working together as much.”
“If we could work harder to actually make a real strong coalition of environmental groups, overall things would be a little more cohesive,” she added.
Wraith also spoke about the struggles she has experienced over the years when it comes to implementing Green ideas. While she acknowledges that “it’s not that the University doesn’t help and work with students,” she said the process can be slow.
“It’s not really as simple as asking for something and then getting immediate action,” Wraith said.
 
She mentioned the work put into the Beyond the Bottle Campaign, which is seeking to eliminate the sale of plastic bottles on campus and increase the number of water fountains or filling stations. In a referendum question passed on the Undergraduate Council ballot in the Fall, students showed support for the movement.
 
Still, the end is not completely in sight. Because less than half of undergraduates voted in the election, UC members are not mandated to write an official stance on the matter, and they have not yet done so.
 
For Wraith, better collaboration between the University and students is necessary. 
“We should be really building this infrastructure,” she said. 
EDUCATE AND EXCITE
Many of those interviewed spoke about the importance of educating and empowering students to reduce trash, especially food waste going forward.
Although Harvard has been recovering refuse for composting since 1991 and has increased its efforts in landscaping and food composting recently, according to an OFS document, Gogan said that much unconsumed food still is left in the trash.
“To me that’s the greatest sin—to take a product that could have nourished human consciousness, the most valuable resource in the world that we know of, and just send it to a landfill where its just going to burp methane and accentuate problems caused by global warming,” Gogan said.
In order to increase environmental awareness, many emphasize the importance of reaching out to students and exciting them about the topic. Already, the OFS uses competitions and sustainability grants, which allow students to pitch ideas and receive funding to implement them, among other means to build a better relationship with students.
Still, Houston said there could be more effective ways to educate and excite people.
Although Wraith noted the OFS and Eco REPs are doing a good job, she mentioned that those pushing for Green efforts “need to be a little bit radical” if they want to change how some students think.
Even during her time as an Eco REP, she said that she found “things that were not working, but [because] that was the policy…you did them anyway.”
Still, Sharma noted, REPs are “constantly trying” to adapt to new technology and methods of engaging students.
Wraith suggested that a recycling awareness imitative should be implemented in the same way that undergraduates are required to complete Harvard Proof, an online alcohol safety program, before they arrive on campus.
“If you have to identify how much is a standard drink…you [should] have to identify what is recyclable and not,” she said.
For now though, on the student level, Olsen and Gogan said they want to continue partnering with various student groups to spread the message across the University ever more effectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After seven years of continuous decline in its admissions rate, Harvard College announced Thursday that it has accepted 2,023, or 5.9 percent, of 34,295 students applying for admission to the Class of 2018—a slight increase from previous years.
 At 5 p.m., the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid will send emails to 1,031 regular applicants receiving offers. Nine hundred ninety-two students were also admitted to the class through the early action program.
The admit rate for applicants considered under regular decision, including the 3,197 early action candidates who were deferred to regular decision, was 3.1 percent, down from last year’s rate of 3.4 percent. Twenty-one percent of students who applied early action were accepted in December.
“The Class of 2018 reflects the excellence achieved by the students of an increasingly diverse America,” said Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 in a press release. “Attracting such students to the College is vital to Harvard’s mission of educating the future leaders of our nation.”
Those accepted to the Class of 2018 represent record levels of diversity, with African American and Latino students comprising 11.9 and 13 percent of the admitted students, respectively. Of students offered admission to the class, 19.7 percent are Asian American and 1.9 percent are Native American or Native Hawaiian. International students compose 10.5 percent of the class and 7.7 percent of admitted students are U.S. dual citizens. 
Fitzsimmons said that more than 63 percent of admitted students and 81 percent of admitted minority students appeared on College Board and ACT search lists that Harvard uses to identify qualified potential applicants from diverse backgrounds.
Fifty-five percent of those admitted are male. While Fitzsimmons said in an interview that the gender breakdown is more tilted towards males than in previous years, he added that the Office of Admissions received more applications from males than females. He also added that growing interest in concentrations at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences that are more frequently studied by men than women, such as engineering, physical science, mathematics, and computer science, have generated more applications to Harvard from males.
7.9 percent of applicants opted to mark their prospective concentration as undecided this year, more than double the three percent that did so last year. In light of this increase, Fitzsimmons said that it is hard to tell exactly how the the class breaks down in area of interest compared to previous years. He did note that 90 students expressed interest in computer science this year, compared to about 56 last year—a 60 percent increase.
 
According to Fitzsimmons, early estimates indicate that nearly 60 percent of those admitted will be awarded some type of financial aid or assistance.
 
“Harvard’s revolutionary financial aid program led a large number of our admitted students to apply,” Fitzsimmons said. “Many were surprised to learn that for 90 percent of American families it costs the same or less to come to Harvard compared to public universities.”
Visitas—the College’s admitted students visit weekend which was cancelled last year in light of the Boston Marathon bombings—has been planned for the last weekend in April. Fitzsimmons said that although the program did not occur last year, the Admissions Office learned beneficial techniques to reach out to students through social media.
“It was a very difficult time last year, but I think we learned a lot and some of our students really stepped up,” Fitzsimmons said. “We are going to leverage that enthusiasm and approach this year.”
A number of other Ivy League institutions are expected to release admissions decisions Thursday. The University of Pennsylvania announced yesterday that it admitted 9.9 percent of its 35,868 applicants, a record low acceptance rate.
Students have until May 1 to accept an admissions offer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a crosstown rivalry game that saw over 50 shots on goal, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team could not pull of a victory against across-the-river opponent Boston College.
The Crimson (4-4, 2-1 Ivy) fell back to .500 on the season with its 13-9 loss to the Terriers (8-2, 1-2 ACC) Wednesday night at Soldiers Field.
Despite an early 3-0 lead to start off the game, Harvard allowed BC to come back into the game with eight unanswered goals to finish off the first half. The Crimson’s scoring drought after its third goal lasted almost a full 20 minutes, with the third goal coming with 19:37 left in the first half and Harvard fourth goal crossing the net 18 seconds into the second half.
“I thought the possessions of the draw control started going a little bit more in their direction so they had the ball a little bit more,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “Then there was a sort of flurry when they were getting the line a lot more so…the momentum shifted in their favor.”
Overall the Terriers more than doubled the number of Crimson draw controls in the game, having a total of 18 by the end while Harvard amassed only six all game. In the first half BC had a 10-2 advantage on draw controls as it dominated play for the final 18 minutes. In the second half there were eight BC draw controls to the Crimson’s four.
“In reality you have to have the ball in order to score which means you have to fight harder for the draw controls,” Miller said. “And when we did do that we did come up with good plays and defensive stops. It’s more about the draw circle. They had twelve more possessions on the draw circle that we did.”
The second half belonged to Harvard, who both outscored and outshot the Terriers. The effort came too late in the game, as the eight point lead BC accumulated in the opening half proved to be too steep for the Crimson to overcome. The team was able to score six goals in the second stanza to BC’s five but never cut the deficit to closer than four goals. The lead grew as large as six for BC with seven minutes to go before Harvard scored the last two goals of the game.
Throughout the game Harvard also outshot the Terriers, amassing 29 tries at the opponent’s goal compared to 25 from the sticks of the visitors. The Crimson also narrowly edged its opponents on ground balls, getting 16 of 31 available ground balls.
“When we had the ball I think we did a good job of taking quality shots,” Miller said. “We took 29 shots and seven of them hit off the pipe, so that’s a pretty good attacking effort things just didn’t go our way sometimes and BC kept coming up with the ball.”
The Crimson offense was headed by freshman attacker Marisa Romeo, who had four goals on the night, including three free position shots and one unassisted score. Romeo leads the team with 26 goals through eight games and has 30 points on the season.
In each of the eight games played this season, a freshman has scored multiple goals for the team, and Wednesday’s game was the seventh time out of eight games that Romeo has scored at least two goals.
Todd and junior attacker Sophia Capone each added two goals for Harvard while senior attacker Chelsey Newman rounded out the scoring for the night with a single tally of her own. Todd added four ground balls while freshman Megan Hennessey and sophomore goalie Kelly Weis each had three in the loss.
Defensively, Weis made her eighth start of the season in between the poles and was able to stop nine of the 22 shots she handled. The Crimson also forced the Terriers into committing more turnovers in the match, pressuring Boston College into seven giveaways in each half while only turning the ball over nine times total, including just three times in the first thirty minutes of the game.
“We started to get a little more aggressive [in the second half],” Miller said. “I don’t know if it is necessarily a sense of adjustment versus when a team has the ball over and over and over again. You can play great defense and keep making defensive stops but eventually they are going to score.”
For Harvard, BC is the fourth team ranked in the top 20 that the team has faced off against this season. The Terriers come in at No. 5 in the rankings and are the second-highest ranked team the Crimson has seen this season.
“[Playing top ranked teams] changes the way you play in terms of pace,” Miller said. “Seeing these teams helps the awareness of the type of readiness you have to have to make you better. The bottom line is that playing better competition makes you better.”

On Tuesday, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy announced that former Crimson football staff member Mike Donovan will be returning as the team’s assistant defensive line coach for the upcoming season.
“We are happy to have Michael Donovan back in the fold,” Murphy said. “He’s a local guy, he understands our system and fits the chemistry of our staff.”
After holding the title of assistant football operations coordinator at Harvard from 2011-2012, Donovan accepted an assistant coaching position at Delaware for the 2012-2013 season. He now rejoins the Crimson with an extra year’s worth of coaching experience under his belt.
The Stoughton, Mass. native was the defensive quality control assistant for the Blue Hens in 2013. His responsibilities included studying game footage for defensive strategy and managing recruiting visits. He was responsible for recruiting both the New England area and portions of the South, in states such as Alabama, Rhode Island, Vermont and Louisiana.
In his only year with Delaware, the Hens won seven games, finishing with a 4-4 mark in the Colonial Athletic Association Conference. His defensive corps finished ninth out of the 11 Colonial Athletic Association teams in scoring defense and tenth in total defense.
After a brief hiatus from the sidelines, Donovan joined Murphy’s staff for the 2011-2012 season. In that year, Donovan helped the Crimson finish 9-1 overall, with a spotless 7-0 Ivy League record and a 45-7 drubbing of Yale in The Game.
Donovan’s coaching career began at his high school alma mater, Stoughton High School, where he was the defensive line and wide receivers coach in 2009 as an undergraduate student at Bentley.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t really matter what your record is coming in. It doesn’t matter if you’re 22-0 or 0-22. When Ivy League play opens up, everyone is 0-0.
For the Harvard softball team (11-11), a clean slate will begin on Friday, as the Crimson travels to Princeton (5-15) to take on the Tigers in a doubleheader and begin play in the Ancient Eight.
Following a disappointing three-game losing streak to end last season, Harvard is hoping to regain its 2012 form when it finished at the top of the conference. For the Crimson, that journey starts with beating the Tigers on their home field.
Harvard is riding a two-game win streak, but it wasn’t all sunshine for the Crimson out in California. Prior to the pair of victories, Harvard posted a 3-7 record on the trip, struggling to score runs and lacking with its play on defense.
Nonetheless, the team will look to carry its newfound momentum into New Jersey on Friday, as the Crimson looks to take advantage of a weaker Princeton squad.
Though the trip to California may not have been as successful as planned, the final two games were won in convincing fashion.
The team allowed a combined three runs and scored a total of 15 in the pair of contests to outscore their opponents by a combined 12 runs.
“As a team, we’re looking to build off of what we had the last day of spring break,” captain Kasey Lange said. “If we have all cylinders firing, we’ll put ourselves in a really good position to win this weekend.”
Harvard will need to play its own game in order to defeat the Tigers. The Crimson features an array of big hitters —including Lange and junior infielder Emily Gusse—and has scored more than five runs in 10 of its contests so far this season.
“Offensively, we know we can get runners on base,” Lange said. “We just need to focus in and get the timely hits that will get us on the board.”
Lange, who is a three-time All-Ivy selection, set the all-time home run record for Harvard when she achieved 30 career four-baggers last year.
In what will be her final season, the Ladera Ranch, Calif. native has picked up right where she left off, blasting three long balls and posting a team-high batting average of .347.
On defense, Harvard’s number one and two pitchers, junior Laura Ricciardone and freshman Taylor Cabe, respectively, will handle the bulk of the innings with relief from sophomore Morgan Groom.
Ricciardone has a 2.42 ERA and has already fanned 39 batters in nearly 67 innings pitched this season. For her part, Cabe has posted a nearly identical 2.44 ERA.
While Groom has thrown fewer innings than the starting duo, a 2.13 ERA makes her a legitimate third option.
“We plan to play Harvard softball,” Ricciardone said. “[We want to] execute good pitches and have solid defense.”
As a staff, Harvard’s pitchers have done just that. The group boasts a 2.38 ERA and has held opponents to a .252 batting average on the year.
In fact, earlier this season, Harvard held No. 22 Louisiana State scoreless for 12 innings en route to a 1-0 win in Baton Rouge.
The rotation has also combined to pitch four total shutouts and has surrendered just one run on three separate occasions to earn victories.
“We are looking for strong starts out of Laura, Taylor, and Morgan,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “We are looking at our pitchers to come out and be strong in the first inning, attacking their offense.”
Although the Ivy League has a reputation where any matchup can be unpredictable, the Princeton offense has been far from impressive so far in its campaign.
Senior Maddie Cousens and junior Rachel Rendina have been the Tigers’ best hitters, but Allard is confident that if Harvard focuses on its own play, it should be just fine.
“We are focused on ourselves,” Allard said. “Princeton is still a great team, and it’s going to be a great matchup.”
Since returning from California, Allard has been preparing her team by emphasizing the importance of coming out strong to begin games. Consistency will be key, especially at the start of conference play.
Though Princeton has struggled to find wins as of late, Harvard will still have to come out with hot bats if it wants to have a 2-0 record after Saturday.
Indeed, the team takes on Cornell the next day, and the bus ride to Ithaca will feel much shorter if the Crimson can do just that.
“We’re excited to being conference play,” Allard said. “We need to focus on playing our game and coming out strong. Pitching, defense, and timely hits will be important. We are trying to fire on all cylinders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was almost one year ago that the Harvard and Princeton baseball teams met at O’Donnell Field in what shaped up to be a wild, unpredictable game that ended in a 20-19 victory for the Crimson.
In that track meet of a game, both teams took advantage of winds gusting up to 40 miles per hour to string together hits and pile up runs. And in the ninth inning, with Harvard down by two, three wild pitches allowed a trio of Crimson baserunners to cross the plate and clinch a bizarre win.
Now, a season later, these two teams prepare to face off again in a Saturday doubleheader at Princeton’s Clarke Field in which Harvard (4-13) and the Tigers (5-11) will both see their first Ivy League action of the year.
“Over the last 17 games, like everyone else across the nation, we’ve been trying to prepare for our conference schedule,” Crimson coach Bill Decker said. “Now it counts, and we need to try to play at that level.”
For Harvard, those past 17 contests have been comprised largely of very close games that haven’t gone the Crimson’s way. Seven of Harvard’s 13 losses this season have come by one run, and the Crimson dropped its last two contests by a combined total of only three runs.
“We’ve faced some really good competition,” Decker said. “[But] with the exception of one ballgame, we had a chance in each of them.”
The Tigers have also had their share of disappointment, although many of their defeats have been less contested. Of the team’s 11 losses, eight have been decided by six or more runs.
Such wide deficits have largely been due to the fact that Princeton’s opponents have found a good deal of success at the plate—the Tigers pitching staff has surrendered an average of 7.56 runs per game.
Harvard hopes to capitalize on this opportunity for run production. But in order to do so, Crimson batters will need to take a more disciplined approach at the plate and drive runners home when they are in scoring position.
This is something that the team has struggled with at times this season. Of the 206 times that Harvard batters have reached base safely this season, the team has only come through with runs in 53 of those instances.
One player who has shown that he can produce offensively for the Crimson is senior utilityman Carlton Bailey. Bailey is first on the team in batting average, hitting at a .323 clip on the year, and he ranks second with seven RBIs this season.
“I’ve really tried to...treat every pitch and every at-bat as the most important of the game,” Bailey said. “It has a lot to do with the mental approach. You have to go up there knowing you’re going to get on base.”
Other key cogs in the Harvard lineup include junior outfielder Jack Colton, who leads the team with 10 RBIs and 19 hits, and junior outfielder Mike Martin, who ranks first with seven steals and 12 runs.
“I think offensively, we can be a ton better than we’ve shown,” Decker said. “The key for us is getting the guys at the top and bottom on base and seeing how we can manufacture runs with guys three through seven.”
Princeton hopes to counter with an offensive attack of its own, as Tigers batters have shown throughout the nonconference portion of their schedule that they can drive the ball effectively.
Four of Princeton’s regular starters—freshmen outfielders Danny Baer and Paul Tupper, sophomore infielder Danny Hoy, and senior utilityman Alec Keller—are currently posting batting averages over .300 and slugging percentages over .400.
Facing this lineup from the pitcher’s mound will likely be the Crimson’s sophomore righty Sean Poppen. Poppen enters this weekend’s competition with a 2-1 record and an impressive 1.44 ERA over 25 innings pitched. Freshman righty Nick Gruener, who averages nearly seven strikeouts every nine innings, is also likely to take the hill for the Crimson.
Saturday’s doubleheader comes at an important point in the season for both teams as they prepare to face more Ivy League opponents later in the season. After playing Harvard, the Tigers will have six conference games against Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale in the span of eight days.
Over that same stretch, the Crimson will face off against Cornell on the road this Sunday before returning to Cambridge next weekend to take on Penn and Columbia.
“We’d like to come out in this first [conference] game and really show what we’ve been working toward all season,” Bailey said. “We’re out to set the tone early and let everyone know that we’re not messing around this year.”

It’s Thursday, which means it’s only one more day until the weekend! Looking back at this past week of post-Spring Break sadness, see which of the situations below applies to you:
Dream: You read inspiring Thought Catalog or LifeBuzz lists of things you should do better or fix in your life (ex. 30 Things to Stop Doing to Yourself), and decide that you’re going to start implementing these uplifting messages and adapting a more positive outlook on life starting from tomorrow.Reality: After staying up late to finish a reading you procrastinated on, you wake up feeling extremely irritated and realize that you hate everything about the world right now.
Dream: You tell yourself that after you lose this round of 2048, you’re going to stop and continue writing that paper.Reality: After you lose, you’re still feeling hopeful and you tell yourself that you feel like you’re actually going to win this time (which is what you’ve been repeatedly saying to yourself for the last 30 minutes) and perpetuate a dangerous cycle of unproductivity.
Dream: After dinner, you promise to yourself that you’ll go to Lamont so that you can have a productive night.Reality: You go home to pick up a textbook, only to realize that you want to change into comfortable clothes for a long night of studying. Afterwards, you also realize that the perfect complement to your comfortable clothes is your even more comfortable bed.
Dream: You’ve made the decision all week that you’re going to stay in during one of the nights this weekend because you’ve put off so much work over Spring Break and want to catch up.Reality: You hear your friends pre-gaming in the common room so you go out to say hi and you somehow end up with a drink in your hand. At this point, you convince yourself that you can’t waste your current state of tipsyness doing homework and decide that everything points towards you going out with your friends.
 
IN THE ATMOSPHEREAfter yesterday’s winds that probably gave you mild panic attacks as to whether or not you were going to crash into the person in front of you, today’s winds are much more mild, and the high is 44 degrees! It’ll also be mostly sunny, which is a blessing for those of us who are willing to accept any semblance of warmer weather.

Later today, high school seniors around the world will be obsessively checking their laptops and phones to see if they have received admission to an Ivy League school (or Cornell). We remember how it feels, so we're here with some worldly Harvard wisdom for potential freshmen so that the wait time won’t be so stressful.
 Stay distracted! The weird love-hate relationship you have with your laptop only gets worse while you wait for decisions. You could stare at your email box and refresh the page every minute for hours before the email is scheduled to arrive, but you shouldn’t. It won’t make the results come out any faster. Go outside (unless you live in sub-zero Boston), and do your homework for one last time before senioritis fully sets in.
Avoid Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. You might try to distract yourself from D-day by checking on other people’s statuses and tweets. But it won't prove to be too distracting because all your pages will be filled with other people who have already heard from schools you're waiting to hear from. You might get distracted for a while by your friend’s admission results (Mary got Princeton! I hope she doesn’t hook up with Princeton Mom’s son). But in the end, it will make you more nervous about your results. Play 2048 or Flappy Bird instead. Better yet, read Flyby!
Get comfortable. Being relaxed before you get your decision is key. Wear the comfy Harvard sweatshirt you bought months ago for luck. Have ready access to snacks (this also counts as preparation for college life where you'll find yourself grazing on cereal and goldfish at all times of day).
Have a support system. It's nice to have someone by your side for whatever happens. If you're celebrating, you need some one to scream with. If things don't turn out how you want, a hug from some one you care about will ease the pain.
Best of luck, and no matter what happens, you'll end up in the right place (unless you get into Yale)!

Applicants to the Class of 2018 hear back from Harvard today. While Harvard may seem appealing for its prestige and history, accepted students should be aware Harvard’s hidden ominous dark side. Here are 7 reasons you should definitely stay away.
 NERDS!Everyone at Harvard is a nerd! The frat stars are nerds, the athletes are nerds, and the nerds are nerds! Everyone, myself included, is a nerd.
The Toaster In Annenberg Is Pretty Far Away From The BreadNo joke, it’s at least 15 steps away. Fascism.
Library Book ChecksAfter a long night of studying, nothing is worse than the Lamont library security check to see if you are stealing precious books. They sometimes even make you open up the small pockets. This process can take up to 30 seconds… UGH!
Only One Freshman Entryway Study Break Per WeekNot only is there no official nap time at Harvard, but there is also only one dorm study break per week. I guess there are also nightly “brain breaks” in the dining halls, but that’s far away and it’s cold, and doesn’t even happen on weekends!
25% Chance of Being “Quadded”You might not be thinking about this now, but Sophomore year you are sorted in houses. Three of the twelve houses are a twelve minute walk away from the Yard! Bummer!
Winter Break Is Too LongFive weeks?! This is an absurd amount of time to be at home resting or out traveling the world. By week four you will probably be too rested. Come on, Harvard, this is just too much time off!
Snaps In AgreementPeople at Harvard will frequently snap their fingers in agreement. What is this, Legally Blonde 2? It’s a little overbearingly supportive, if you ask me.
DivestmentHarvard’s administration refuses to divest from fossil fuels. This puts the environment and the future of the planet at risk. Whoa… that got heavy fast. Actually... let’s leave that one off.
