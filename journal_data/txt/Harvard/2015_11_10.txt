After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When visitors entered the Institute of Contemporary Art’s galleries this weekend, they encountered not a traditional piano concert but instead the startling sight of a Steinway, its strings laced with rubber and metal, upon which pianist Elaine Rombola played selections from John Cage’s “Sonatas and Interludes.” Cage premiered the complete work in 1948 during a visit to Black Mountain College, an experimental, arts-centered school in North Carolina that brought together many key artistic figures of the postwar period. The works of teachers and students at the college, from Josef Albers to Willem de Kooning, are featured in “Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1945,” an exhibition that opened last month at the ICA.
Before the performance, Rombola spent about an hour and a half preparing the piano by tying some of its strings with rubber bands and inserting metal screws and erasers between others, according to the exact measurements provided by Cage’s score. These operations transformed the instrument’s sound. “The piano sounds like an entire percussion ensemble,” Rombola said.
During Rombola’s performance, the sounds created by the striking of the keys shifted, at some points resembling the ringing of bells or the plucking of harp strings, at others the noise of tapping on a hollow piece of wood or the plunk of a pebble into a deep pond. The music itself ranged from energetically rhythmic, evocative of drums and stomping feet, to meditative and resonant, almost like a lullaby. “John Cage discovered a whole world of sound in the piano that no one had ever heard before,” said John Andress, the ICA’s associate director of performing arts, in his introduction to the performance.
As Rombola sat practicing Cage’s piece and adjusting the piano before the performance, a girl of about 10 wandered over to listen. “Are you playing a song or just random notes?” the girl asked after standing in puzzled silence for a few moments. “It’s a song, but that’s a very good question,” Rombola replied, laughing.
Cage’s piece departs from many of the conventions of musical composition. His instructions for placing the objects among the strings, for example, were written based on a specific piano; since pianos can be of different sizes, much of the setup depends on the pianist’s judgment of what makes the notes sound best. At one point during the performance, Rombola even paused to adjust one of the screws. Cage’s work is characterized by an openness to chance, contingency, and individual interpretation that counters traditional definitions of authorship. He also challenges the autonomy of art—its perceived separateness from ordinary experience—by bringing mundane household objects literally into the piano and figuratively into the sphere of creative production.
The performance within the gallery space evoked the connections between Cage’s ideas and the visual arts. A monoprint, “Female Figure” by Robert Rauschenberg—a student at Black Mountain College with whom Cage would later collaborate—hung across from the piano. Like Cage’s piece, Rauschenberg’s work, created by having a model lie on photosensitized paper so that a pale silhouette of her body appeared on a cyan background, de-emphasizes authorship and incorporates non-traditional artistic materials. The physical interaction of the model’s body with light, rather than Rauschenberg himself, makes the image, on a surface similar to sunprint paper.
In an interview following the event, Rombola, a pianist and teacher trained at Oberlin and the New England Conservatory, says that she has always loved Cage. “I find them endlessly engrossing. I could play them all day,” she says of “Sonatas and Interludes.” She adds, however, that Cage’s work is challenging not only in terms of ideas, but also in terms of its physical performance: Playing a prepared piano piece requires a different touch by the performer, because the amount the keys must be depressed to create sound changes with the insertion of objects into the strings.
According to Rombola, however, Cage’s work is often treated as a joke by musicians and composers. Andress, who himself comes from a music background, agreed. “To be completely honest, he's much more revered in the visual art world than he is in the music world,” Andress said. “Visual artists love him, but I find composers, even good friends, are still skeptical or dismissive of some of his compositional practices.”
Yet Andress acknowledged that Cage’s tendency to stray from the typical, for all that it invites the derision of his fellow musicians, is masterful in the way it challenges listeners and their preconceived notions about music. “John Cage tends to muck things up a bit, to upend our ideas of what music can be,” he said.

UPDATED: November 10, 2015, at 10 p.m.
The publicity posters for “Noises Off,” which the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club is producing in Farkas Hall Nov. 6-15, boast that it is “frequently called the funniest farce ever written.” It follows, then, that most productions of the play, including this one, aim less at exploring the human condition or pushing the boundaries of the medium than at creating laughs. Director Boyd I.R. Hampton ’16 presents the farce as straightforwardly as possible; although this focuses attention on the actors and their hilarious physical comedy, it also makes for theater so unambitious that it loses some of its interest.
“Noises Off” depicts a group of incompetent, overworked, and occasionally hateful people disastrously putting on their own farce, “Nothing On.” Although the play is originally set in 1980s England, Hampton’s version takes place in contemporary America. This decision takes the form of changing “Stockton-on-Tees” to “Buffalo,” adding an iPhone, and dropping most of the English accents; its intent is unclear. Since the play is presented otherwise wholly traditionally—the program thanks “unnoticeable lighting,” done by Eliza B. Mantz ’18—the update feels like an obligatory attempt at a twist. It adds neither relevance nor humor, especially because some of the show’s fun derives from its accents and English silliness.
In fairness, even if these changes don’t enrich, they don’t offend. Because “Noises Off” doesn’t try to be anything more than a good time, it is a highly enjoyable show. The play’s high-energy buffoonery demands much from its cast, and they deliver: They storm and flail around the stage so convincingly that they broke multiple set pieces on opening night. In particular, James M. Graham ’17 brings vitality and vitriol to the razor-sharp and egotistical director Lloyd Dallas; Brooke E. Sweeney ’17’s comic timing as the forgetful actress Dotty Otley adds a hapless, bitter wit to the otherwise-lowbrow hilarity; and Juan E. Bedoya ’16 impresses as a tearful stage manager.
To Hampton’s credit, he moves the play’s three acts along briskly enough that the show never drags, even in its exhaustingly chaotic second act, which takes place backstage and for which the stage is rotated 180 degrees. The jealousies and love triangles among the actors in “Nothing On” lead to misplaced props, missed cues, and multiple attempted murders, and the cast of “Noises Off” must tell most of that story through pantomime. It is a challenging choreographic task, but Hampton, fight choreographer Danielle T. Lessard ’16—who also plays actress Belinda Blair—and the cast execute it admirably.
Mantz, who also (excellently) plays assistant stage manager Poppy Norton-Taylor, indeed lights the show nearly unnoticeably. The set, designed by Hampton and Dylan J. Peterson ’17, is similarly inconspicuous, at least until it rotates for the second act. And the costumes, designed by Sweeney and Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, aim at the generic. These decisions seem unified by a sort of minimalism-by-normality, a total de-emphasis on the elements of theater that aren’t script and acting. Unfortunately, the resulting staging is so unobtrusive that it becomes bland. The raison d’être of “Noises Off” may be comedy for its own sake, but these production decisions combine with the contemporary American setting for a certain sterility that undermines the raucous, raunchy humor of the script they’re meant to highlight.
However, it feels unfair to accuse the “funniest farce ever written” of not taking the artistic considerations of capital-T Theater seriously enough. After all, Frayn’s script celebrates, albeit perversely, the absurdities of the world of theater. The salient element of the HRDC’s “Noises Off” is not its dramaturgy or staging but that it is really funny. Whatever its disappointments, it creates a delightful two and a half hours at the theater, accomplishing exactly what it set out to do—although nothing more.

Editor's Note: This article has been updated to disclose that the author of this story had auditioned for the production reviewed.

Biting wit met the supernatural in “Ruddigore; or, the Witch’s Curse,” to genuinely comedic effect. The Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ latest endeavor, which ran Oct. 30-Nov. 8 in the Agassiz Theater, brimmed with energy. Backflips and extended chase sequences filled the stage in a show of lively dynamism, but “Ruddigore” was ultimately a delightful experience not for the hilarity of its script but instead for the intelligent approach taken by its cast and crew. Through well-rounded acting and effective technical design, the production successfully provided laughs with a dash of fitting self-awareness.
“Ruddigore” follows Robin Oakapple (Jake A. Corvino ’19), who is actually Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd, the Baronet of Ruddigore—a cursed position that forces him to commit a crime every day or perish in agonies. After faking his death and passing his nefarious duties to his younger brother Despard (Andrew B. Jing ’19), Robin lives as a farmer and falls deeply in love with the beautiful maiden Rose Maybud (Arianna N. Paz ’19). His pursuit of Rose and simple life soon unravels, however, when he must accept the title he has tried to shirk. Ghostly hilarity and romantic hijinks ensue as the characters move towards a satisfactory resolution in typical Gilbert and Sullivan fashion.
Stage director Guan-Yue Chen ’17 relocated “Ruddigore” from a Cornish town in the late 1800s to New Orleans during the Roaring Twenties. At some moments, this directorial decision felt extraneous to the production, except to define an aesthetic atypical from the usual English-based HRGSP shows and perhaps to make Rose’s adherence to proper etiquette more ridiculous. Nevertheless, the relocation seldom distracted from the storyline of the play, while it allowed the technical crew to showcase its talents and creativity. For instance, the set design, by Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students Elizabeth Pattyn and Rahul Kulka, transitioned cleanly from the brightly colored houses and steamer that represent New Orleans to the darkly painted Ruddigore mansion, filled with foreboding images of past Baronets, between the first and second act. Such attention to details (like a gold elevator with unmistakably 1920s adornments) created a sense of seamlessness as the production progressed.
The comic opera’s high-quality production extended beyond the set design. The lighting design, by Kathleen C. Zhou ’17, complemented the events occurring on stage with intense results. When Mad Margaret (Julia E. Belanoff ’18) first appeared, the lighting shifted from the lighter yellow and pink hues of previous songs to a red as stark as Belanoff’s dress; the effect was powerful and immediately signaled that Belanoff’s character was different from those introduced earlier. In that way, the lighting successfully contributed to defining the mood of the production—a mood that often acknowledged its own histrionic quality.
Strong vocal and theatrical performances from the entire cast enhanced the production’s hilariously melodramatic character. Gilbert and Sullivan shows demand agile, powerful voices that can spew out tongue twisters in a slick manner—a requirement that every cast member fulfilled thoroughly. During “My eyes are fully open,” Corvino, Jing, and Belanoff effortlessly chirped their lyrics on pace with the orchestra’s quick tempo. The only flaw in this astounding feat, however, appeared when the orchestra overpowered the actors’ singing. This issue occurred several times throughout the production, and in a show where the best lines and greatest plot development are often sung, it detracted from comprehension.
Meanwhile, each actor infused his or her individual performance with energy and excitement. For instance, Erik B. Fliegauf ’19 as Old Adam Goodheart, Robin’s dutiful servant, strutted around with arms splayed and mouth often agape, to great humorous effect. Juxtaposed with the tongue-in-cheek nature of the source material, such potentially over-the-top performances struck a hilarious chord. “They sing choruses in public,” Mad Margaret says of Despard and his crew. “That’s mad enough, I think.” Stated in a theatrical production, the line spoke to the show’s self-aware nature, and the actors emphasized this idea through their stylized performances.
While such acting might have seemed one-dimensional in another production, HRGSP infused this show with a certain charm and self-consciousness. This was most evident in the little nuances afforded to each character. For instance, Corvino excellently balanced Robin’s supposed humility and timidity with the royal gusto expected from someone born into an aristocratic position. He complemented the false modesty suggested for his character in the script (at one point, Robin says, “You’ve no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself, and how little I deserve it”) with certain tics, such as his constant preoccupation with adjusting his cuffs or the way he occasionally clicked his tongue. This attention to detail resonated in the performances of each member of the cast, aiding in elevating the show’s quality to a higher level.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ latest show was a boisterous operetta filled with just the right amount of humor and dramatics for its source material. Ultimately, even with an occasionally too-powerful orchestra, the strong performances and technical design in “Ruddigore” made it an excellent romp that continued HRGSP’s tradition of providing lighthearted, high-quality productions.

Founded in 1980 after the 1977 Harvard-Radcliffe merger, the Harvard Opportunes is the university’s oldest co-ed acappella group. On Nov. 7 in Sanders Theater, the ensemble celebrated its 35th anniversary with “Poppin’ Champagne,” an event that showcased current and veteran members alike—including over 70 alumni—highlighting 35 years of heartfelt music making and solidifying the Opportunes’ sense of community.
Members of the Opportunes saw the jam as a way to access and appreciate an extensive alumni network, which comprises over 200 members. “Our goal is to really make this year the year that we engage the alums and make sure after this anniversary our alumni base and current group are in touch,” says Toni Divic ’17, president of the Opportunes. “We want to embrace the long history we have, and the jam gives us the chance to establish that long term-connection.”
According to Music Director Dylan R. Schaffer ’16, organizing a grand event like “Poppin’ Champagne” required extensive preparations. Although the Saturday evening concert was the main event, the group also planned a banquet Friday evening and brunch on Sunday. Members of the Opportunes started preparing months in advance, specifying their plans in the early summer. Despite the challenges involved with the planning, behind-the-scenes work was rewarding for the group. “We’ve had an amazing experience this time around,” Schaffer says. “It’s a testament to how important the Opportunes are to everyone who has ever taken part of it since 1980. Sharing that experience is a unique one, and getting to have that kind of energy in a room together is really exciting.”
The first half of Saturday’s jam exhibited the alums’ dedication and passionate spirit as they performed songs of their own choosing from their time with the Opportunes. The latter half of the show—a set of 12 songs—focused on contemporary tunes performed by the current group. To achieve a fusion of past and present, alumni and current members partook in Opportunes traditions during the performance. “There are two songs we’ve been doing for decades,” says Kathryn E. Kearney ’17, the Opportunes’ live production manager. “One is ‘Up the Ladder To the Roof’ [covered] by The Nylons, the second ‘Change In My Life’ from ‘Leap of Faith.’” Both have been sung by the group for years.”
The jam also gave the Opportunes the chance to challenge themselves musically. The group usually focuses on performing reinterpretations of contemporary music, specifically Top 40 hits and popular throwback tunes. For the 35th Anniversary jam, they chose to extend their repertoire by including a variety of genres. “Thinking about this set especially, we tried to break out even further out of our normal comfort zone,” Schaffer says. “We’re doing some jazz music and Afro-punk and really cool genres that really push limits and definitely things that we haven’t done before to this extent.”
Divic, Kearney, and Schaffer all agree that meeting and working alongside former Opportunes was a memorable event in their time spent as members of the ensemble. “It’s going to be a really exciting weekend,” Divic said before the jam. “A lot of good stories are already starting to pour in. A lot of excitement about people coming back together, who haven’t seen each other in a long time.”

Ross Gay, one of this year’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Fellows, was recently named as a finalist for the National Book Award in poetry for his collection “Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude.” Gay is an associate professor of English at Indiana University, in Bloomington, as well as an orchardist, gardener, and kettlebell teacher. The Crimson had the chance to sit down with him and ask him about his most recent and upcoming work.
The Harvard Crimson: What projects are you working on as a Radcliffe Fellow?
Ross Gay: There are a few that I’m working on. The Georgics project [a response to Virgil’s “Georgics”] is still sort of turning around in my head…. Another book I’m in the middle of writing right now is this book about my own relationship to the land. I’m talking about race and nation and the imagination. And the last project I’m working on is a poem that uses this one famous move by the basketball player Dr. J; it meditates on this move as a way to think about flight and falling and the imagination.
THC: How did you get interested in those subjects?
RG: The “Georgics,” the “Black Georgics,” or “Anthropocene Georgics”, however it’s going to be—that’s a project that has become interesting by reading Virgil’s “Georgics,” which is a book that is totally fascinating and weird and useful and everything else. The other thing is that I’m a very serious gardener and orchardist, and it’s a kind of grower’s handbook, an agricultural handbook.… The other book...about my relationship to the land—that is inspired by my increasing interest in working with the land explicitly. But also it’s inspired by some untold stories in my family history, some investigation into what’s happening with the land, what has happened historically with the land, how some of those stories have unfolded due to slavery and due to various other policies. All of these things feel really provocative and interesting to me.
THC: Could you tell me about your gardening and orchard work?
RG: I have my own garden, which is pretty involved, and a lot of fruit trees. I grow garlic and potatoes and onions and collards and kale and chard and other kinds of greens and blueberries and blackberries and raspberries and gooseberries and serviceberries and figs and jujubes and on and on and on.… And I work with the Bloomington Community Orchard. It’s a non-profit, free-fruit-for-all orchard that’s entirely volunteer-run and a really interesting civic, food justice collaboration project.
THC: In your poetry, you seem to find significance not necessarily in some grand wilderness but in everyday nature. Why do you believe this topic is important?
RG: Well, one of the things that I think that the book [“Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude”] is trying to do is to kind of cultivate in myself…a kind of reverence for the everyday, which is not in fact everyday.… I’m far more interested, frankly, in the little, the stuff that is not particularly grand or “big-P poetic.” I’m way more interested in these small interactions or observances that to me, with some meditation, with some study, become filled with the same kind of wonder as a “sublime” thing.
THC: I recently read an essay you wrote for Sun Magazine about structural racism. At the end of the piece, you have this vision inspired by an encounter with a beehive of how, through mercy, these systems can be reimagined. What relationships do you see among the race, the land, and the ways in which nature can help us to see things differently?
RG: This is something I’m thinking about right now. I’m thinking about a really interesting metaphor. The metaphor is that planting a seed is a kind of generative act. It’s an act also that requires a certain kind of capacity for metaphor—you have to understand that this thing is that thing, and that that thing is ideally going to feed people. So it seems to me that there is something really profoundly important about understanding that, even if we don’t have the capacity to do that...to understand that as a fundamental way of thinking about possibility, which to me feels precisely the opposite of the closing down of the imagination that racism is or requires. It’s a kind of anti-generative imaginative process, whereas the land or an intimate relationship with the land potentially is always imagining ourselves and others into the future.

Actors have many skillsets that can be of use to the layperson. One of these is resilience, the ability to endure difficult times and to inculcate hardship into one's life journey. Unlike most professionals, the majority of career actors spend a lifetime seeking employment. Actors mostly work on a project-by-project basis, and—except in relatively few cases when actors have recurring roles on long-running television shows or on film sequels—the contracts are usually short-term. Consequently, the actor’s path toward occupational stability is often rife with uncertainty and rejection. In order for an actor to endure and succeed career-wise, he or she must have patience, grit, and hope—all qualities that are necessary for success in other vocations.
The journey toward accomplishment can be long and torturous for the majority of actors. In the United States, most aspiring actors seeking lucrative careers in film, television, and theatre often gravitate toward major cities—such as Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago—to find work. Some eschew profitable employment in other fields, preferring to work as restaurant servers, bartenders, security guards, valets, etc.—low-paying part-time jobs with flexible schedules that allow them to pursue the perpetuity of auditions that seldom lead anywhere. The actor must learn to “hang in there” despite all odds, always hoping that the perfect role and a big break are just around the corner. Patience, tenacity, and optimism are fundamental assets in the professional actor’s toolbox.
For many actors, success is not clearly defined. Even for well-known thespians, failure often lurks around the corner. An actor’s masterful work may be marred by other factors, such as the opening weekend box office receipts of a specific project. One example is the recently released biopic “Steve Jobs.” Despite Michael Fassbender’s critically acclaimed performance in the starring role, some critics have pointed to his inability to “carry” a movie, using the film's tepid box office performance as evidence. In an article on Hollywood news website Variety.com titled “‘Steve Jobs’ Bombs: What Went Wrong With the Apple Drama,” Brent Lang writes that Leornardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale skipped on the project before Fassbender signed on, adding, “Michael Fassbender, the electrifying Irish actor who replaced Bale as Jobs, lacks the drawing power to open the picture.” First, Lang commends Fassbender for being a talented actor. Then the writer backhands Fassbender for lacking star power. Lang’s observation may be true, strictly from a Hollywood perspective. However, should Fassbender be faulted for his critically acclaimed film’s commercial misfire after fulfilling his contract as an actor and being praised for his work? Fassbender’s predicament in this case is the quintessential plight of the actor.
Talent alone does not suffice for the actor. In her thesis titled “Acting Strengths: The Development of Resilience and Character Strengths in Actors,” psychologist Laura E. Taylor states, “Due to high levels of competition, even the mastery and successful presentation of objective skills such as the ability to dance, sing, or play a musical instrument is not enough to ensure work in the performing arts.” In other words, an actor’s talent does not guarantee career success. Taylor continues, “A variety of subjective factors may also be at play when an actor auditions for work. It is possible for actors’ physical condition (height, weight, hair color, etc.) to impact whether or not they are hired for a particular job.” Per Taylor, the success of an actor hinges not only on his or her ability but also on factors beyond the actor’s control. Actors get turned down for jobs for reasons that might lead to litigation in other occupations.
Considering the slim chances of long-term success for the actor, one wonders how some actors retain careers for so long. Veterans such as Robert de Niro, Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, and Morgan Freeman, to name a few of the rare examples, have been making movies and have stayed in the spotlight for decades. De Niro, for instance, the acclaimed star of classics such as “Mean Streets,” “Taxi Driver,” “Raging Bull,” and “The Godfather Part II,” has in recent years appeared in comedies, dramas, and action thrillers. He has seemingly adapted to changing times and not been deterred by the inevitable occasional disappointment.
The intrinsic unpredictability of the actor's career mandates that thespians have thick skin, a quality that behooves those working in other careers as well. As former Navy SEAL and Rhodes Scholar Eric Greitens states in his book “Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life,” “Resilient people do not bounce back from hard experiences; they find healthy ways to integrate them into their lives.” Greitens highlights that one must learn to embrace hardship as an integral part of life. Just as actors remain resilient through difficulty, even incorporating their adversities and triumphs into their work, others can do the same and “keep on keeping on” despite all odds.

“Some actors couldn’t figure out how to withstand the constant rejection. They couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.” — Harrison Ford
“I take rejection as someone blowing a bugle in my ear to wake me up and get going, rather than retreat.” — Sylvester Stallone

Perhaps the most salient aspect of the hipster paradox is hipster fashion. Eighty dollar distressed jeans from Urban Outfitters are paired with two dollar t-shirts from the local thrift shop. To the casual observer, hipster attire is effortlessly assembled—“I wear what I think looks good,” the hipster says. “I don’t care about price.” While this addendum might imply some sort of financial humility, it arguably means just the opposite. The hipster, in pursuing the purely aesthetic, has the privilege of making sartorial decisions without thinking about money. Exploring why the hipster wears what she wears is therefore a study of the financial identity that hipsters wish to convey. This identity is a hybrid result of the hipster’s wish to supersede mainstream monetary sensibilities while simultaneously enjoying the privilege their money provides.
The question of enjoying this privilege was especially salient after the 2008 recession. Overt displays of money were seen as insensitive, to the point that even Michelle Obama made a point of re-wearing a dress to her husband’s second-term inauguration. How, then, could one dress “rich” without being insensitive? The answer to this dilemma was one that perfectly aligned with the hipster aesthetic: By eschewing common status symbols, the hipster could further cement her alternative status while simultaneously crafting a unique style, one that was just idiosyncratic enough that so-called outsiders would not recognize this display of wealth (and here the hipster is allowed to save face by not flaunting privilege) but universal enough that it would become the mark of an in-group.
This in-group dynamic is key because it allows hipsters as a group to decide what does and does not imply status. In order to supersede sticky discourse about wealth and privilege in a post-recession period, hipsters seem to avoid financial judgment and focus on the aesthetic. However, the absence of a financial consciousness points either to a total abundance of money or a complete lack thereof. When the very poor don’t think about money, it’s because they don’t have it—but when the very rich don’t think about money, it’s because they do. Take, for example, the oft-repeated line about hipsters looking poor. They can probably afford to dress well, and yet they choose not to. It is this element of choice that is essential for framing something as a social movement and not simply a social reaction. Minimalism is the choice to live with less. Being forced to live with less is simply called poverty.
Thus, the dynamics of hipster aesthetics are mired in the same privilege that they initially sought to replace, or at the very least modify. In order to be blasé about possessions, one must first become desensitized—and there is no better way to become desensitized to materialism than to be surrounded by material possessions. This lack of want is essential, because, as writer Phoebe Maltz Bovy puts it, “To be seen wanting nice things detracts from one’s status.” Therefore, in order not to care about status symbols, the hipster must be able to afford them.
The hipster, with the knowledge that she can afford these status symbols, can wear whatever she wants without jeopardizing her image of financial security. In the same way that men who embody standard notions of masculinity can engage in traditionally non-masculine acts without jeopardizing their image (“Tough guys wear pink” is an excellent example), so too can wealthy people dress as poor people, because they are in no danger of being mistaken as such. Thus, this identity confers a sort of immunity upon the hipster, allowing her to experiment with the symbols of her social status without truly jeopardizing it. The hipster’s attempt to avoid thinking about money while simultaneously enjoying the privileges that wealth provides points to the inseparability of their wealth and social image. After all, if you are trying not to think about something, you are still thinking about it.

Many classic elements make appearances in Mercè Rodoreda’s “War, So Much War”: a journey, a castle, a mirror, a beautiful girl, a crone in a forest cottage. Then again, every coming-of-age story is something like a fairy tale—a story of transformation, of innocence encountering evil. Rodoreda successfully weaves an intricate allegorical examination of evil, both beautiful and disturbing, without the simplistic moralizing of many fairy tales.
Rodereda begins with the story of one young man but soon expands to a masterful description of many people struggling against the horrors of modern life. Adrià Guinart, feeling bored and suffocated, runs away to join the army. He quickly flees the fighting and wanders in search of something he cannot name. He falls in love, witnesses evil, seeks vengeance, and ultimately returns home. Those Adrià encounters on this phantasmagoric journey tell their stories in brief vignettes, each beautifully wrought and intriguing. In hands less skilled, so many stories interspersed in the broader arc of Adrià’s tale might feel disjointed, but Rodoreda makes them flow, creating an immersive portrait of a people strained both by war and by more commonplace hardships. There is a man so fat he cannot walk, a quarreling couple, a bricklayer who lost his home to bombs, a barber avoiding the wife he no longer loves, and a man trapped in his own castle, robbed of his inheritance. Interacting with Adrià, they remain static; one glimpses their minimal development and transformation only through the stories they tell, small windows into colorful lives. Against these static, preserved lives, Adrià's character is refreshingly dynamic and self-reflective. Like the Biblical Cain—and bearing similar forehead mark—he feels himself cast out, compelled to wander. Yet he finds purpose in such dislocation: “everyone knows that Cain killed...” a fisherman tells him, “but some people regard him as someone who seeks knowledge, who never relents, who lets nothing stop him, who wants to know everything there is to be known.” In Adrià, Rodoreda strikes a delicate balance, a rich internal narrative of maturation and self-discovery juxtaposed with attentive narration that allows other stories to flow around Adria’s own.
Rodoreda's language is effortlessly precise, lavishing detail on everything—nature, dwellings, people, corpses. The tone, both fantastic and melancholy, glides between scenes. The effect is a sense of place simultaneously tangible and timeless. Maruxa Relaño and Martha Tennent's impeccable translation from the Catalan preserves this lyricism, and the pages are rife with delightful images—“a lion or giraffe-shaped cloud munching on the blueness of the sky”—and rich, effusive descriptions that pour forth as if unleashed by a broken dam—“pomegranates with their queenly royal crown that appears when their curly leaves fall, and the crown emerges sealing a hard green round box filled with diamonds as red as the blood when you cut yourself.”
Despite Rodoreda’s title, war remains in the background for much of the novel, almost—but never quite—forgotten. The war contorts the experiences of those Adrià encounters, but Rodereda makes it impossible to determine which leaves a larger imprint—war? Or poverty, religion, or everyday human love and sorrow? The book never witnesses true battle, only its aftermath: the bombed villages, the bodies in the river, the deserters, the amputee who abandons his fiancé, and the wailing woman hopelessly seeking her soldier husband. Yet Rodoreda subjects scenes of carnage to the same relentless attention to detail that pervades the rest of the novel: “Dead men who seemed to be asleep, on their sides, their legs drawn up; dead men with eyes open to the sky, dead men without legs, without arms… skeletons of soldiers with bones picked clean by the birds,” reads a brief excerpt of Adrià’s inventory of a battlefield, the calm presentation making the scene particularly unsettling.
This war seems apolitical, indefinable. A few facts, such as Rodoreda’s Catalan nationality, suggest that the war in question is the Spanish Civil war, but without this outside context it would be unclear who is fighting who, much less where and for what reason. This impressionistic picture of the war is a perfect reflection of the characters’ experiences. Adrià certainly has no idea what he is fighting for, much less the causes or overall shape of the conflict. The same holds for those he meets on his wanderings, who struggle halfheartedly to elucidate the reasons for the fighting: “It is to beat back the enemy, but…to our enemies, we are the enemy… Even if we win this war, it’ll be as though we’ve lost it, the way a war is set up, everyone loses.” This distance from the grand politics motivating the war makes Rodoreda’s condemnation all the more powerful. As the story is timeless, so is the criticism. There are no clear instigators of war; rather, the seeds of violence lie in everyone, even those who seem most innocent. Adrià watches two little girls eagerly torture an earthworm, screaming, “Another worm! Another worm! Let’s kill it! Let’s kill it!” Strangers sometimes arbitrarily treat Adrià with kindness, even after catching him stealing, yet other times they beat him and accuse him of kidnapping, though he has done nothing wrong.
This point about the internal origin of human wickedness is driven home in a jarring penultimate vignette that reveals the fate of Eva, Adrià's elusive love interest. If there is any flaw in the novel, it is that this scene, with its stark brutality, feels out of place in an otherwise beautifully nuanced and ambiguous tale. Yet this, too, is something of a strength—the scene shocks and horrifies, making it clear that human cruelty does not always remain shrouded in lyricism and surrealism: it can be deeply personal, not merely observed in the stories of others. “Would the remembrance of evil dissipate or would I carry it with me always, like a malady of the soul?” Adrià asks himself. Rodoreda’s ending etches evil deeply in memory, ensuring it will not be subsumed by the softer tone of the rest of the novel.

Sia’s latest single, “Bird Set Free,” displays the artist reaching new spaces in sound and lyrical content. Released on Nov. 3, the track is the second single off her upcoming album, “This is Acting.” While still in line with Sia’s reliable melodicism, “Bird Set Free” is a far cry from the danceable billboard beats of “Chandelier.” The energy is still there—but it takes a less overstated, more stirring form.
Like “Alive,” the first single released from her next album, this song was written in collaboration with Adele. Both songs were, in fact, originally intended for Adele’s upcoming album, “25,” but were picked up by Sia when Adele passed on them. Adele’s influence can be felt throughout the track. Crisp piano notes in the beautiful instrumental intro sound like a track off of “21.” The piano cuts off when Sia begins to sing, and a percussive backdrop keeps the tempo for the rest of the track. Sia belts the emotional ballad with reckless abandon—she is never eclipsed by electric beats. Like “Alive,” the song as a whole emphasizes Sia’s strong vocals, a choice somewhat unexpected from an artist who has recently moved further into the pop genre.
Sia is well known for her lyrical talents—she has written songs for a number of prominent artists, including Beyoncé, David Guetta, Maroon 5, and Britney Spears. That lyrical talent is manifest in “Bird Set Free.” The emotionally laden song tackles the issue of relationship abuse through the image of a captive bird, setting up a delicate central metaphor with short, choppy phrases. Building on this beginning, she creates an analogy between the imprisonment of the animal and the loss of her voice. Drawing on the raw intimacy of the song, she characterizes the victim with alternating pronouns of “I” and “we.” Sia’s distinctively full-bodied voice faintly obscures some of the words, but in the chorus she clearly repeats “I’ll shout it out like a bird set free” three times.
The title of “This is Acting,” which will be released on Jan. 29, communicates that each song was actually written for another artist. In this way, Sia movestowards a kind of self-referential pastiche—she’s practically playing Adele, but doing so with a kind of unique aplomb that separates her from her collaborator. This kind of elegant moving through styles is perhaps a foreshadow of “This is Acting.” Whether Sia’s other reclamations of her songs work as well as “Bird Set Free” remains to be seen. In any case, the amalgamation of Sia and Adele begs future collaboration from the influential pair.

Grimes’s latest album, “Art Angels,” was faced with a number of wildly different and often contradictory expectations. The album—the fourth for Grimes, the music project of Claire Boucher—follows her critically-acclaimed breakthrough third release “Visions” and faces the challenges more typical to those of a debut follow-up. It is Boucher’s first album since signing to major management, Roc Nation, but it is still released on independent label 4AD and is meant to appeal to two different, if overlapping, audiences: both the indie rock world that embraced her in 2012 for “Visions” and the pop world, in which Boucher is moving, with stylistic ambiguity, toward stardom. “Art Angels” has come after an eons-long wait in pop terms—a whole three years since “Visions”—during which time Boucher apparently wrote and scrapped an entirely different album. Somehow, magically, marvelously, the album lives up to all these difficult, different expectations, and on Boucher’s fiercely independent, unorthodox terms. It is a true triumph.
The album opens with “laughing and not being normal,” which could only be termed a string overture. It features an itchy and insistent cinematic string and piano arrangement over which Boucher sings in a ghostly falsetto. The opening track beautifully sets the stage for an album that both reaffirms the vocal stylings for which Boucher is known and serves as a radical departure from her oeuvre—she is certainly not identified as an expert arranger of strings.While deeply connected to her previous work, “Art Angels” is also something powerfully radical and new.
While Boucher’s previous three albums were clearly inspired, in part, by elements of pop music, “Art Angels” is the most thorough embrace of the genre. Many of the tracks on the album—all entirely composed and produced by Boucher—have new studio sheen. There is a deep vein of bubblegum that runs through the album, and tracks like “California,” “Flesh without Blood,” “Artangels,” and “Butterfly” explore a more sugared sonic territory than Boucher has previously ventured into. For all their sweetness, though, these songs are undercut with real grit and well, grime. “California,” which sounds like it was co-composed by two very different California girls—Katy and Joni—pairs breezy beach pop with melancholic lyrics. “Flesh without Blood,” the album’s big pop single, uses the framework of a “Since U Been Gone”-ish break-up track to discuss Boucher’s move toward the pop mainstream—she sings from the perspective of a jilted fan, giving voice to criticisms of the album with lines like, “Your voice, it had the perfect glow / It got lost when you gave it up though / Cause you want money / You want fame.” Underneath its seemingly straightforward surface, it is a bizarre, disorienting listen—a perfectly Boucher take on pop. It pairs nicely with the album’s closing track, “Butterfly,” in which Boucher, addressing these same critics, sings cutely if cuttingly, “If you’re looking for a dream girl / I’ll never be your dream girl.”
Not all of the pop styling that Boucher explores is similarly sugared—“Kill V. Maim” and “Realiti” stand out as tracks that have obvious mainstream influence but are of a less sweet variety. “Kill V. Maim,” which Boucher described in an interview with Q Magazine as being about Al Pacino from “The Godfather: Part. 2,” “except he’s a vampire who can switch gender and travel through space,” features a darker, more intense sound backing track over which Boucher delivers a vocally virtuosic genre- and gender-defying performance. “Realiti,” which Boucher released as a demo last spring to much adoration, has a shimmering, truly gorgeous sound. It is a stunningly lovely listen.
Two of the best tracks on the album, “SCREAM” and “Venus Fly,” feature Boucher collaborating with other artists—in the former, Aristophanes, a Taiwanese rapper, pants, howls, hisses, screams, and, yes, spits, over a sonically dark and viscerally intense Boucher-produced track. In the latter, Boucher and Janelle Monae, the high priestess of cyborg pop, deliver a sharp rebuke of scopophilia over a backing track so jamming that, when Boucher drops in some Celtic fiddling halfway through, the song is only improved for it. It is a wonderfully fierce, powerfully anthemic, liberatory listen, and, unsurprisingly for a Boucher-Monae collaboration, it is thoroughly danceable.
“Art Angels” is a dense, multilayered, multifaceted album with a stunningly diverse array of influences. In the final track on the album, “Butterfly,” Boucher sings, “harmony is everywhere.” Throughout the album, she convincingly substantiates this claim. Boucher draws inspiration and influence from across genre, weaving together disparate yet surprisingly resonant elements from a segmented, heterogeneous musical landscape. In straddling seemingly contrary musical worlds, Grimes, in her own pop-tastic and iconoclastic way, makes a case for the polymorphic and pluralistic, finding unexpected overlaps, continuities, intersections, and harmonies.

And I cried.
Jude wept.
There was an effusion of liquid from the eyes of Jude, Il Patron, the Judester, Jude-eh-Jude-eh-Jude (na na nananana).
And not just, like, a single manly tear. I mean sobs. Ugly sobs. Red-faced, scrunchy-chinned, air-gasping sobs. I had to leave the room. My parents were there. I was 16 years old. It was embarrassing.
It took me 10 minutes to get myself together and come back to the movie. Sobbing was kept to a minimum for the rest of the film. Sniffles were noticeable but unremarked. The remainder (blinking on the family room TV screen) was watched in moderate silence. My brother rolled his eyes a lot at the occasional nose-blowing.
So, what I guess I’m saying is “Wings of Desire” hit me pretty hard in the old emotional-cum-intellectual metaphorical solar plexus and it was a big event in my life. Wim Wenders, 1987. West Berlin. Angels. Classic girly shit. A real blow to the masculinity for somebody whose favorite movies had been “The Godfather” and “Rocky.”
When I was 16 years old, in the summer before my senior year, I was trying to figure out what to do with my life—which colleges to apply to, which disciplines to study, how I was going to use my major to feed myself after school, etc. etc. I was already well on my way to internalizing the Great American Lie that you are what you do and what you do should be making money, and that the money was mostly focused in ye olde hard sciences, and while biology was fine I wasn’t too super keen on the mathy stuff, and it’s the mathy stuff that makes you the big bucks, so we’d better start pretending we like the mathy stuff, hadn’t we, Jude, since it’ll come in handy whether you’re in actual research in development or if you’re just going to be one of the clever bastards on Wall Street pushing around the imaginary assets that led to the Crash, which career, while on the whole perhaps detrimental to society, at least promised rather a lot of money (even for New York) and a certain nice socio-economic-cultural cache. In other words, I was feeling pretty miserable and depressed and unfulfilled and generally kind of low in a cattle-ish, numb, soul-selling kind of way. Alienation, for lack of a better word. I was pretty alienated.
So it’s July and I am cattle-ish and depressed, and my mom has us watch this silly-looking Kraut movie about angels in Berlin. Worse than just being about angels who require subtitles, it’s about an angel who falls in love with a trapeze artist. I mean, please. Come on, America. It’s 2011. Trapeze artists? Angels? Love? Love died in the 80s, Mom. Right after they filmed “The Princess Bride.” Money-power-grandeur-economic-value, though. That’s some pretty hot stuff right now, Mom. Let’s watch a movie about rich people. Because that’s what it’s about, Mom. Being rich, right? Right?
So I’m watching this movie with my mom and dad and little brother who’s been coaxed away from his computer for half an hour, and there are these angels who are completely objective and immortal and full of boundless knowledge but who don’t really enjoy it. Who wish they could change. Who wish they could feel pleasure and pain. Who wish they could touch people instead of just hearing their thoughts. Who want to be there, to experience, instead of just accumulating images and symbols and the other currencies that represent human experience.
It was a lot.
I was already borderline-weeps by time the suicide happened. A man on a skyscraper. Headphones. Oblivious to the crowd screaming at him to step back from the brink, that it wasn’t all bad, to live. An offhand remark—off the building—fin. The end. No more man with headphones. No more accumulation of things, but worse, no more experiences. No more feelings. No more people. The dark.
I quickly went from borderline-weeps to full weeps and had to step out, as described.
I wish I could say that I made the change at that point from evaluating my life’s success in accumulation to describing it by experience, by living well. I didn’t. I still haven’t shaken that sense that I’m not doing things properly if I’m not accumulating the proper counters.
But I will say that I’ve been suspicious of the counters since then. Of headphones. Of not hearing the shouts from the people on the skyscraper. Of choosing to be alone. Of choosing to be not human.
And maybe I can say, with the fallen angel, after these years,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

It’s a chilly Saturday night in October, and, below Annenberg, the Queen’s Head Pub has been transformed into a space that bears a striking resemblance to the hottest of nightclubs, with bone-white strobe lights casting the dancing crowd in stark relief. It’s College Night at the Queen’s Head, and, behind his turntable, Vivek Jayaram ’17, aka DJ J-Rom, is directing the crowd’s tempo as he modulates the music pervading the room. It is his second gig at the Queen’s Head, and he is utterly controlling the space, to the crowd’s delight. “At about 11:45 pm, a flood of other people just stream onto the dance floor,” Jayaram says. “I showed a video to some of my friends and they’re like, ‘I can’t believe that was the Queen’s Head.’”
The Queen’s Head Pub has launched a new initiative this semester: College Nights on Thursdays and Saturdays. During these evenings, student bands and DJs come out to perform, providing something akin to a concert experience only a stone’s throw from the Yard itself. These College Nights have the potential to prove crucial to the health of Harvard’s student band scene, and their growing popularity indicates the existence of a heretofore untapped niche in the large Harvard social scene.
Canonically, being in a band has never been painted as an easy prospect; the trope of the up-and-coming band, struggling to get gigs, is not uncommon. Harvard bands do not, perhaps, lead the threadbare lives traditionally associated with the struggling musician, but being in a band at Harvard carries its own share of difficulties.
A fair few of these difficulties are infrastructural, such as Harvard’s scarcity of band-friendly practice rooms. Though there are many practice spaces available on campus, most of these are ill-suited to the unique needs of student bands. “There are a few vestigial drumsets from years ago, but there aren’t really places to rehearse here in a well-stocked way,” says Miles Hewitt ’17, songwriter, guitarist, and sometime pianist for The Solars. Most practice spaces, especially those located in houses, do not allow electric instruments due to concerns about noise. However, there are a few practice spaces that do cater to student bands—the Quad Sound Studio is one such space, and there are soundproofed, collaborative spaces below Memorial Hall and in the SOCH—but these spaces are relatively few compared to the bounty of other, more traditionally-oriented practice spots. “I have to be honest and say that I’m a little bit discouraged by the number of practice spaces—particularly with drumsets—that there are on campus,” says Stephanie M. Johnson ’18, Off the Record’s pianist. “It makes it really hard to rehearse.”

But there are less tangible difficulties that Harvard bands face, such as the struggle for publicity. Of all the manifold elements that contribute to a band’s success, publicity is viewed by bands on campus as among the most important factors. And the best, most basic method for a band to improve its reputation and build up its credibility is by performing as much as possible, according to Ethan I. Simon ’16, bandleader and pianist of The Intrinsics. “You take every gig because you never know which one’s going to be the gig that gets you those other gigs,” Simon says.
For student bands, however, locating opportunities to perform at Harvard can be a trying process. “Getting to play here at Harvard is something I’m really interested in pushing more for,” Johnson says. “But it’s actually much harder than I anticipated to find gigs on campus.”
Most gigs are secured through informal, word-of-mouth channels, and the services of less well-established bands tend to be rarely solicited due to their relative obscurity. These difficulties are compounded by the lack of a system to connect student bands with organizations looking for live music. “I would love to have some kind of newsletter or email list or even just knowing who’s in charge of the events,” Johnson says.
The difficulties posed by the somewhat opaque process of securing gigs is compounded by a more general dearth of opportunities to perform at Harvard. Many student bands, such as The Solars, Off the Record, and Margarine, opt to play at other schools, such as Berklee and Tufts, or at other venues in Boston, such as Naga and the Middle East Nightclub. “There isn’t a space on campus where bands can just perform,” Hewitt says. "At other colleges, there is like a concert space that is the dedicated concert space on campus. And they have enough bands that they can have shows three times a week, and people will go to them…that’s not how things are designed here for a variety of reasons.”
Most of the regularly available Harvard gigs consist of performances for select subgroups of Harvard affiliates. “You can play House formals, you can play a final club or a party,” Johnson says. “That’s all I really know of [within Harvard].” These performances, however, have the disadvantage of restricting bands’ audiences, which serves as an obstacle to their need to build their reputation in order to secure more performances.
This lack of dedicated, reliable spots to listen to live student music is a factor that Further dampens the Harvard student body’s interest in the live music scene. According to Hewitt, The hardworking ethos and loaded workweeks common to many Harvard students can often translate to a certain reluctance to spend leisure time outside established comfort zones “People don’t just go to shows to go to a show. There isn’t a lot of impetus to be going to people’s performances in general,” Hewitt says. “I wish I saw more people taking risks with their time to do something that they don’t necessarily know is going to pan out.”

All this seems to paint a particularly grim picture of the Harvard Band scene—which is perhaps unfair, given that many of the difficulties faced by Harvard bands are by no means unique to Harvard and are obstacles any band must face. But Harvard is beginning to respond to the needs of student bands via the Queen’s Head Pub’s College Nights, which, every Thursday, give student bands the opportunity to do a paid gig for the patrons of the Queen’s Head. This initiative has potential to provide student bands with exposure and a consistent venue, among other boons.
Playing gigs is an important way to garner publicity, and the Queen’s Head’s College Nights provide a regular, recurring opportunity for bands to play live shows, allowing them to show their mettle to the student body at-large. “There were a lot of different people there—a lot of HoCo people there also, which was awesome, because they were the ones who started setting us up with the House gigs and the student life event gigs,” says Abby L. Westover of the Lighthouse Keepers of her Thursday night performance at the Queen’s Head. “That was definitely a huge push for us publicity-wise.” At the same time, the open nature of the Queen’s Head also provides a venue for the student bands’ established fans to view them.
But beyond providing a venue and a viewership, the Queen’s Head’s College Nights are also important for building the confidence of young bands. For student groups that are just getting started, playing a paid gig in a comfortable setting can be an important step in cementing the group’s status as a band. The Queen’s Head has been the first gig for many freshman bands, such as Foxpack and Margarine, but, simultaneously, the Queen’s Head’s willingness to hire new bands does not feel like a mere sop to new acts. “It is very much a meritocracy. You submit your demo—if your demo’s good you can play a gig at the Queen’s Head,” Simon says. “There’s a certain legitimacy attached to the idea that there are a limited number of Thursdays, and you earned one of these Thursdays.”
By serving as a safe space for a first gig, the Queen’s Head is actively helping the prospects of Harvard’s younger bands. “The music scene in Boston can be shady and weird…there are a lot of predatory things on young bands,” Simon says. “As far as establishing a healthy music scene on campus, it’s really good that the Queen’s Head is paying acts. It’s Harvard as an institution saying, ‘This is worth something. It’s setting bands up for healthy second or third gigs.’”
The Queen’s Head’s College Nights are also valuable to more seasoned bands—they provide these acts with a reliable, increasingly well-known venue for live performance and, in so doing, contribute to the band culture at Harvard. “The Queen’s Head has been stepping up to kind of provide a place where people can go to see music once a week or twice a week,” Hewitt says.
Beyond the benefits that the Queen’s Head provides to student bands, its College Nights also stand to furnish a service to the larger student body, simply by offering a legitimate, vibrant social space on Thursday nights. Although this aim has been part of the Queen’s Head’s mandate for quite some time—their own mission statement says as much—Thursday’s College Nights, as well as Saturday’s DJ Nights, have lent the Queen’s Head substantial weight as a legitimate after-hours social space. “The Queen’s Head seemed like a backup option to people,” Jayaram says. “But that was the first weekend, and it’s changed since.” The Queen’s Head Pub’s increase in cachet as a result of its College Nights can be seen as part of a solution to worries that some students have expressed recently as a perceived lack of social spaces at Harvard.
This concept of inclusivity in social spaces is not new to anyone on campus—it is a conversation that’s being held repeatedly all around Harvard, with the changes surrounding final clubs, the upcoming redesign of the Smith Campus Center, and the whimsical UC proposal to turn Pusey Library into a freshman hangout spot. For all this talk, though, it seems as though the Queen’s Head is one of the few on-campus bodies actively pursuing this ideal of an open social space—the venue is indeed open to all Harvard undergraduates. And, as the College Nights have gained momentum, it has so far managed to maintain this inclusivity while still remaining an attractive destination for a night of music and dance.
This tricky balancing act is perhaps being aided by the atmosphere of candor that live music tends to foster. A big part of what gives the Queen’s Head’s College Nights their authenticity as open spaces is an honest desire on the part of the bands to share their craft with others. “Music, for most of human history, hasn’t been something that you could have,” Simon says. “You couldn’t own music. Recorded music is very young. It’s always been something that people do together, that people do for each other. I think there’s something really compelling about live music, and people working really hard to create good live music. And I think it’s great that the Queen’s Head is trying to do that, and trying to do that in a way that doesn’t feel illegitimate.” The Queen’s Head, by facilitating this communion between listener and musician, may well be the herald of a new breed of night-out for the campus and a new mode of expression for its bands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the third grade, I watched Legally Blonde for the first time and became sure of two things: I would go to Harvard, and I would become a lawyer to fight against injustice. As I prepare to apply to law school, I am troubled by the justice system that I am choosing to be a part of. A system that disproportionately incarcerates African Americans and Latinos at alarming rates. One in three African American boys born today will enter the prison system at some point in their life. Because of the overuse of incarceration in this country, we, the self-proclaimed land of the free, find ourselves with the world’s largest prison population.
Last week, President Obama announced new initiatives to help former inmates after release. Among these actions was a call for Congress to pass legislation to “ban the box” identifying former arrests and convictions on job applications. A day earlier, 6,100 federal inmates were released on retroactive applications of new sentencing guidelines. However, approximately 2.4 million people remain in state and federal prisons in the United States.
The War on Drugs caused an explosion in the use of the criminal justice and prison systems. In 1968, President Johnson declared that the government would take actions to curtail the production, distribution, and consumption of narcotics. In the 1980s, the prison population began skyrocketing and has since quadrupled.
From policing to reentry, practices became highly racialized. Crack cocaine, a cheaper version of powdered cocaine, was specifically targeted and vigorously prosecuted. The majority of crack dealers were African Americans, and enforcement techniques targeted these communities. In 1986, Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing ratio for the possession or trafficking of crack as compared to powdered cocaine. Five grams of crack, for example, carried a five-year minimum sentence, the same as 500 grams of powdered cocaine. These new guidelines established sentencing standards that effectively took away judicial discretion and mandated lengthy sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. Crack cocaine prosecutions led to racial disparities in the prison system.
Local police departments were incentivized to make as many drug-related arrests as possible. Police officers disproportionately surveilled African American and Latino neighborhoods even though studies show drug use and possession are higher among whites. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws pressured people, even innocent ones, to take plea bargains rather than risk uncertain and possibly astronomical sentences by going to trial. African Americans are ten times more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses and serve as much time for nonviolent offenses as whites do for a violent offense. Once in prison, conditions are inhumane. And after release, former inmates find themselves in a catch-22. Parole often requires parolees to seek employment and pay incarceration fees, but employers are hesitant to hire former convicts. When legal employment opportunities are limited, some will turn to the illegal economy of the street to get by, thus increasing the likelihood of returning to prison. Felony charges also disqualify people from receiving housing assistance, food stamps, and many other public benefits. Felons are also precluded from voting, thereby taking away one of the most fundamental rights of a citizen. It is no wonder that the recidivism rate in the United States is consistently around two-thirds.
Why does the phenomenon of mass incarceration persist even after crime declined in the early 2000s? First, mandatory minimum sentencing laws continue to weigh over sentencing hearings. Only recently have states like Ohio, Delaware, and Massachusetts begun to reform mandatory sentencing. Second, people are still serving out sentences for nonviolent drug offenses from ten, twenty, or even thirty years ago. Only some states, and very recently the federal government, have begun implementing retroactive release for time served to match the new sentencing revisions. Third, because opportunities after release are so limited, prisons are provided a steady flow of inmates. Lastly, the privatization of prisons has provided special interests groups with huge revenues and lobbying power to keep prisons full.
A lot needs to be done to put an end to the era of mass incarceration.
Mandatory minimum sentencing and three strikes laws need to be reformed in all states. Moreover, new sentencing guidelines need to be applied retroactively.
More resources need to be allocated to helping former inmates reintegrate after their release. Additionally, resources need to be put into schools instead of prisons to help communities prevent young boys and girls from ending up in prison. Programs like My Brother’s Keeper have been successful in helping to keep children in school and provide them a second chance after release.
The privatization of prisons needs to stop. We cannot continue to let private companies profit off the pain that communities of color suffer when their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters are locked up.
Policing practices need to be altered so that policing means safety not surveillance. We must recognize that there are terrible flaws in current practices that have led to racially-charged violence. Black lives matter, and communities of color need to be protected not persecuted.
Finally, we need to change the culture of our criminal justice system. We need to show compassion and reassess the goal of incarceration. As Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, reminds us: “Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Junes ago, tragedy struck my town and no one talked about it until the September after Michael Brown’s dead body turned into the source of a raw red river on Missouri concrete. But suddenly, it was all everyone talked about. Brendan Tevlin was a nineteen-year-old boy who lived in my town and went to a prep school nearby. He was shot eight times, and he was white, and the shooter was brown, and the shooter had motives that made him seem like a member of the society of Seven Days in Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon.” The shooter was quoted later saying “All these [Iraqi] lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life.”
The day before Thanksgiving break, Wilson was not going to be indicted, and Michael Brown was dead. Brendan Tevlin was dead, and some crazy brown man was on the loose. I was falling in love with Toni Morrison, and a teacher I had asked if language was always and completely incapable. We said yes, and she stopped class fifteen minutes early. She asked about the jury decision, and we mumbled responses. “I don’t,” she said, “see race. I don’t think Wilson is a racist. I don’t see people saying what happened to Brendan Tevlin is racism. I don’t understand how you can hold a gun up to someone and just see a color.”
So with that statement, without any regards to statistics suggesting institutionalized racism particularly involving police brutality, Brendan Tevlin and Ali Muhammad Brown, Michael Brown, and Darren Wilson became simply other cases where color didn't exist and color was causing problems. Where, while white people had spiraled out of racism, had learned to be inclusive, had foundationally and progressively changed, colored people still could not let go of their color. Where white people could see that safety had sacrifices, and colored people still could not understand that violence was never the answer. Even if my teacher was the most brilliant person I have ever met; even if she seemed to understand everything about love, life, art, language, beauty, and kindness; even if she was so passionate and wise she brushed all her students to silence; even if her classes on “Beloved” were so deep that they hurt; she was indisputably and irrevocably white, and she was still wondering if Toni Morrison would ever write a book that had a more universal theme, that wasn’t so political. Colorblindness is a refusal to acknowledge that whiteness is not an ultimate goal, that color, especially in this country, will never be only skin-deep.
I will never be able to describe what kind of humanness I felt when I realized the sentence “Sally is the girl with eyes like Egypt and nylons the color of smoke” came from color, when I stopped imagining Sally as white and took her as brown and black and, finally, yellow. When yellow faces appeared in my history textbook in pre-Civil War America, when I could answer where I would have sat on Rosa Parks’ bus. When the yellow girls I met were, without reservations and qualifications, stunning and sexual. When I learned to say, first quietly, then loudly, that color is not just oppression. Color is not just an obstacle to being white. Color is driven by pleasure, the slow slippery kind that bleeds into the way you walk, that runs through the crevices of your neck. Color is the way you see, the way you taste, the way you are.
Color is the way you learn to be. And to live without it, to ignore it, is to simply not be.
It is impossible to love yourself without understanding the skin you inhabit. For colored people in America, it’s more difficult to understand that skin because sometimes, it’s almost impossible to taste the pleasure when its color seems to have brought a disproportionate amount of historical, systemic, traditional, brutal pain. But that pain is supposed to be approached, broken through. Because you have to learn to live.
Because when I was learning to be yellow I was learning to live. I was watching my skin shimmer in the sun like gold and I was learning to love a body that seemed as seamless and flat as water. I was extending my toes in cold fresh dirt and learning to cheer when I clapped. Because yellow was something I learned to know. Yellow was how older girls shifted their legs, and yellow was their stories that started with “Three years before Jerry became a sex offender and back when he was pretty, I started skipping SAT class.” Yellow was taping my eyelids open and dancing until I was too dizzy to remember to flirt; and yellow was chicken for dinner and trips to New York and boys like options and high heels and Christmas lights I could never hang on a tree. Yellow was my hands drenched in pond water trying to catch a turtle with my best friend after PSATs. Yellow was how all the characters in every story I ever wrote were white but I was working on it, and yellow was loving e. e. cummings until I didn’t.
And learning to be yellow was learning to be kind. To be kind to myself. To be kind to everyone who believed my successes were their failures and my failures their successes. To be kind enough to not ask “what’s wrong with me.” To be kind to people who thought me too girl or too yellow to talk, to write, to think, to love.
And learning to be yellow was learning to love. To love the way my grandpa said “strawberry” with four syllables. To love both the parts I knew and the parts I would never know about my parents, and all those rail workers and soldiers, plantation workers and picture brides, bachelors, taxi drivers, shop owners, graduate students, and restaurant owners that came before me.
And learning to be yellow is learning to want. To be brave enough to want. To know enough to want. To want snow in June and hellfire in December and half-broken hearts and sweat that tastes like summer.
And learning to be yellow is learning to know. To know that there are two types of oppression: one that comes when others pound it into you, and one that naturally occurs when you decide to stand and watch and simply be. You could spend your lifetime wondering which one your oppression is and never taste freedom. Or you could feel it change you into someone capable and strong, stronger than a gunman, good enough to survive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent controversy has erupted over a class on the online learning platform edX, co-founded by Harvard and MIT in 2012 with the mission of increasing worldwide access to courses at universities around the world. Some Harvard professors have alleged that the course “Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought,” offered by Tsinghua University, represents a particularly biased perspective on history, one that is influenced greatly by the Chinese Communist Party’s official historical account of Mao’s life. Indeed, this course, taught by an associate professor of Tsinghua’s School of Marxism, does raise important questions about the future of online learning. As edX attempts to increase access to high quality education, it must expend increasing efforts to ensure the quality of its courses.
Our overall position on edX remains unchanged: It is exciting that Harvard is trying to broaden access to higher education. EdX as an organization provides classes from Ivy League and comparable institutions to people who would ordinarily not be able to experience them. It democratizes education and helps open Harvard’s vast knowledge base to anyone with an Internet connection. Still more commendable is edX’s collaborative nature—more than eighty-five top universities and other partner institutions from numerous different countries contribute courses, ensuring that students can benefit from a global perspective and reach.
As edX expands, however, it cannot focus solely on improving accessibility; the platform must continue to maintain a high standard in the courses that it accepts. Making courses accessible does no good if they are not also well designed and well taught. These are not only administrative and pedagogical questions but also ones of objectivity. Questions of objectivity are not easy to answer; after all, every history course displays some bias, takes some angle in its portrayal of past events. EdX should certainly not be in the business of censoring content, but it does need to establish clearer rules on conflict of interest.
In the case of “Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought,” we have a course that aims to represent a recounting of modern Chinese history taught by an institution controlled in part by the primary actor in that historical story. It explicitly seeks to explain Mao Zedong’s political philosophy—though that is an important historical and political subject, it would be better covered by an institution not so closely affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Perhaps unsurprisingly, other experts in the subject matter have flagged the course as lacking objectivity.
Of course, this is not a call to exclude all courses taught by Tsinghua University from edX. Tsinghua is undoubtedly not only one of China’s top educational institutions, but also a growing global university in the world’s largest country. It is responsible for real and serious scholarship in dozens of fields, and the fact that it is in a nominally communist country certainly should not mean its automatic exclusion from edX.
This situation is unique because of the deep institutional ties between the university and the subject matter as well as the course’s billing as a purportedly objective historical account. Going forward, edX must be sure to think critically about how it communicates its goals and standards to its university partners. Let us not forget that widely available high quality equation requires both availability and quality.

Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 argued Monday that holding the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the 2010 case Citizens United v. FEC primarily responsible for campaign finance issues is “a dangerous oversimplification.”
In a large Law School classroom where attendees outnumbered seats, a discussion dubbed “If Citizens United Isn’t the Problem, What’s the Solution?” centered on the 2010 ruling that the government could not restrict independent political expenditures by nonprofit corporations.
“The American people are disgusted by the current state of campaign finance,” Tribe said, but he argued that focusing the narrative of American political ills on Citizens United would increase political cynicism and alienation without addressing real issues.
“First of all, Citizens United is not the indefensible position its critics claim,” he said. “Second, the way we fund campaigns in this country is actually less central to our political problems than it is made out to be.”
Two slogans associated with the anti-Citizens United movement, “Money isn’t speech” and “Corporations aren’t people,” are well-intended but naive, Tribe said.
Tribe said he considers Buckley v. Valeo, rather than Citizens United, the landmark legal case related to campaign finance. In its ruling in 1976, the Supreme Court held that while the government could restrict individual contributions to political campaigns and candidates, it could not limit independent expenditures in campaigns, expenditures by candidates from their own personal or family resources, and total campaign expenditures.
Tribe argued Monday that the Citizens United ruling “expand[ed] that logic to corporations.”
As an alternative to focusing on Citizens United, Tribe suggested that critics direct their efforts towards Speechnow.org vs Federal Election Commission. In that case, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that because the Supreme Court does not consider combating corruption a legitimate reason to limit independent expenditures in campaigns, the government similarly could not restrict contributions to groups that made independent expenditures.
Tribe said this case would be easier to challenge because it fell under the purview of a circuit court and represented an extension of the Citizens United ruling.
Attendees had differing reactions to Tribe’s arguments. Some agreed with his expansion of the campaign finance reform discussion to more than Citizens United, and others still stressed its primary significance.
“I just think that Professor Tribe is a bit optimistic in his outlook in the sense that the whole system of campaign finance is basically a quid pro quo between the super PACs and the politicians,” Law School student Zeeshaan Z. Hashmi said.

Harvard Business School had raised $861 million toward its capital campaign goal of $1 billion at the end of June, according to Business School spokesperson Officer Brian Kenny.
The school raised more than $600 million in gifts and pledges as part of the “quiet phase” of its campaign, which publicly launched in April 2014. The remaining $261 million was raised since then. 
At 15 percent of the University-wide $6.5 billion fundraising drive, the Business School’s goal is the second largest of Harvard's schools, behind the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' $2.5 billion campaign.
The Business School will use the funds it raises through the campaign to increase financial aid for students, support faculty research, fund efforts such as research and conferenes abroad, and construction on the school’s residential campus. Construction is now ongoing at the school's Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, a new education center with classrooms, meeting spaces, and a cafeteria.
The campaign also looks to finance online education programs like HBX Live and CORe.
As of mid-September, the University has raised $6.1 billion in gifts and pledges in the University-wide campaign, edging close to its $6.5 billion goal. The FAS’s campaign has also nearly reached its $2.5 billion goal, having raised a total of $2.2 billion.
Harvard Medical School, meanwhile, has raised more than 60 percent of its goal, and the Graduate School of Education had its most successful fundraising year ever, raising $177 million, nearly 71 percent of its $250 million campaign, as of Sept. 30.
In September, University President Drew G. Faust said the University has no plans to raise the campaign’s fundraising goal despite the likelihood that it will soon surpass it.
The Business School and the rest of the University's schools have roughly three years left to fundraise before the overall fundraising effort concludes in 2018. This is the fourth campaign since the Business School’s founding in 1908; its most recent capital campaign closed in 2005.

The use of prescription drugs among American adults increased significantly from 1999 to 2012, according to a new study published Nov. 3 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study, “Trends in Prescription Drug Use Among Adults in the United States From 1999-2012,” was conducted using survey data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The research team was led by epidemiologist Elizabeth D. Kantor of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York—formerly a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health—and Edward L. Giovannucci, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the School of Public Health.
The study revealed two main findings, said Kennedy School of Government professor Joseph P. Newhouse, who was not involved in the research. The first was an increase in the prevalence of the use of prescription drugs, from 51 percent of adults in 2000 to 59 percent in 2012. The increase persists even after accounting for the changing age distribution of society over the course of the study
The other finding, Newhouse said, was an increase in the use of polypharmacy, which the study defined as the simultaneous use of five or more drugs. Approximately 8 percent of adults reported polypharmacy in 1999-2000; that number almost doubled to 15 percent by 2011-12.
These changes can be attributed to many factors, according to the study, including increased access to cheaper generic medications and broader prescription drug coverage for segments of the population such as senior citizens.
The study also revealed that eight of the top 10 most commonly used drugs are prescribed for conditions associated with cardiometabolic syndrome, which are linked to obesity.
This, Kantor said, "raises the question: could obesity be affecting the landscape for prescription drug use?” adding, “ I wouldn’t say it’s all one factor, it’s probably a number of factors acting together. But I do think obesity could be a part of it, but so could lots of things.”
Despite the study’s results, experts said the research is not necessarily cause for alarm.
“I would encourage people not to jump to the conclusion that we are using medications too much,” said Glen T. Schumock, a professor of pharmacy practice and pharmacy administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Over the time period examined in the study, he added, “new guidelines have been developed and published by medical societies that suggest that physicians can prescribe more medications, rather than less.”
“It can be possible that for some people, applying for more drugs is more appropriate,” Newhouse said. “All in all, whether the increased use is a good thing or bad thing is hard to tell from this paper.”

Thousands of essays, journals, and other archival documents from the 17th and 18th centuries are now available online, after a group of Harvard libraries launched the Colonial North American Project website last week.
The launch is part of a broader push to digitize the archives in the library system. The Law School library recently announced an effort to digitize its collection of United States case law, and the Harvard-wide library system is conducting a fundraising campaign to support digitization projects among other efforts. 
Material in the Colonial North American Project comes from repositories including the Houghton Library and the Harvard University Archives. In addition to addressing daily life, the documents also reflect the “origins of the United States” and “aspects of life and work in Great Britain, France, Canada, the Caribbean, and Mexico,” according to the project website.
Diana D. Loren, the director of academic partnerships and museum curator at the Peabody Museum, spoke at a panel presentation for the Colonial North American Project last week. She discussed the Harvard Yard Archaeology Project—a dig she co-administers every other year in front of Matthews Hall—and the value of studying history with both archival documents and artifacts at hand.
“It’s amazing,” Loren said. “The way we can access those documents, not only the curators but the students.”
Loren said she has made use of digitized documents in researching colonial Harvard history.
“Being able to look at some of those early documents to find out more about the state of the University, the state of the College, the state of the students—that’s an incredible boon for us,” Loren said. “And there’s stuff coming to life that we haven’t seen before.”
English professor Amanda Claybaugh said she could only find documents by word of mouth when writing her most recent book, and she wished she had had access to such a database, as it would have made her research far more efficient.
Claybaugh cautioned, however, that physical documents should still be archived even after they are digitized in case the digital file becomes corrupted.

UPDATED: November 25, 2015, at 10:55 p.m.
Experts from various disciplines convened Monday to debate the issues and question the politics surrounding the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this December.
The panel discussion, which took place at the Kennedy School of Government, centered around both the short-term and long-term implications of the conference for national and international climate change policies.
“We wanted to offer an intensive look at all sides of the debates in Paris to allow our community, our students to take an active part in these critical conversations for our future,” said event organizer Cathryn A. Clüver.
Nations participating in the talks have already set measurable goals in preparation for the conference. The panelists emphasized the change in policy which Director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment Daniel P. Schrag characterized as a shift from “top-down negotiation” to a “bottom-up approach,” meaning a focus on country-by-country commitments as opposed to international standards.
The panelists agreed that this approach will yield far better long-term results because countries will have an incentive to meet their own goals.
The panelists had varying opinions on the implications of climate change for developed and developing nations.
René Castro Salazar, the former Minister of Environment and Energy in Costa Rica, spoke about the eventual consequences of global warming and rising sea levels on Latin American nations. “They will suffer the most. The small island states will disappear,” he said.
Panelist Robert N. Stavins, who is a Kennedy School professor, said one of his hopes for the conference would be “putting aside the unproductive disagreements between what we initially characterize as the developed and the developing world.”
The experts were all in agreement that the Paris conference is only one step in a much longer process aimed at addressing climate change, and all the panelists expressed optimism regarding the possibilities presented by the Paris conference and changing global policies.
“It’s not only what happens in Paris, but it’s also what happens beyond Paris and the actual, concrete steps taken on the ground,” said Paula J. Dobriansky, former under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs.

Lawyers representing a pro-affirmative action group of current and prospective Harvard students argued against a court’s rejection of the group’s motion to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit against the College last week.
The group, which comprises nine prospective students intending to apply to Harvard and five current students at the College, filed a motion last April to intervene in the lawsuit accusing Harvard of employing race-based discrimination in its admissions processes. In its initial filing, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice—the pro bono legal group representing the students—characterizes the students as sharing “present or prospective interests in living and studying in a racially diverse environment.”
Judge Allison D. Burroughs denied the request in June, writing that that students lacked “a significantly protectable interest” in the case. She granted them amicus status, and the group subsequently filed an appeal. 
Attorney Taylor M. Owings ’08 represented the students in the appeal hearing at Boston’s First Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, arguing that “the rule allowing interested parties to intervene in a lawsuit was designed exactly for this purpose,” she said afterward.
“The underrepresented minority students applying to Harvard and studying among the diverse student body there are the people who really stand to lose” in the lawsuit, Owings wrote in an email. “We think the district court made reversible legal errors in deciding otherwise.”
The Thursday hearing is the latest development in the lawsuit accusing the College of setting “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities and illegal quotas on students of Asian descent in its undergraduate admissions processes. Filed last November, the lawsuit has been put on hold pending the affirmation action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin’s return to the U.S. Supreme Court this December. Parties are currently awaiting word on the terms governing the Harvard case’s discovery period.
In its initial motion, the Lawyers’ Committee argued that Harvard’s consideration of legacy status, standardized test scores, and early action applications had an adverse effect on minority applicants, preventing the College from adequately speaking on behalf of the intervening students. The filing also suggested that Harvard may be reluctant to “expose its own history of past discrimination or to address ongoing problems with race relations or dissatisfaction with racial diversity on the campus.”
Neither Harvard nor Students for Fair Admissions—the anti-affirmative action group that is suing Harvard—supported the students’ proposal to intervene in the lawsuit.
Former U.S. Solicitor General and Harvard Overseers president Seth P. Waxman ’73, writing on behalf of Harvard in a response to the motion, wrote that the University would “adequately represent” the students and recommended that Burroughs assign the group amicus status instead.
At the hearing Thursday, according to Owings, Waxman reiterated Harvard’s claim that the prospective intervenors and the College have the same interest in the lawsuit and said the College would not settle with the plaintiffs. Patrick N. Strawbridge, representing Students for Fair Admissions, agreed with Waxman that Burroughs’ ruling should stand, Owings said.
The appellate court’s ruling on the appeal is forthcoming, although Owings said the case has been expedited and a decision may arrive sooner than typical. According to Owings, the intervening group is awaiting the verdict and currently has no future court appearances scheduled.

Representatives from the Undergraduate Council say they hope to get involved with the ongoing review of Harvard’s Program in General Education, the undergraduate core curriculum that a spring report deemed “failing on a variety of fronts.”
According to Scott Ely ’18, the UC’s Education Committee chair, representatives plan to meet this semester with Sean D. Kelly, a Philosophy professor and the chair of the committee reviewing the Gen Ed program. Ely said they have not yet set a date to meet, but that students will advocate for increased student input in the Gen Ed review.
Before Faculty ultimately make any changes to the program, Ely said, he wants to make sure College students and their opinions are factors in the decision-making process.
“We really want to make sure that the students are getting their voice heard,” Ely said.
The UC leadership’s move to weigh in on the Gen Ed debate follows heavy scrutiny of the program from professors from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The professors who authored the Gen Ed committee’s critical spring interim report concluded that students tend to be less invested in their Gen Ed courses and that the program overall lacks a clear identity. The core curriculum suffered, professors have said, from administrative turnover and financial woes throughout its implementation, leaving it characterized by many of the same problems that it was intended to fix.
The Gen Ed review committee has since solicited faculty feedback on plans to overhaul the program, which could include a decrease in the number of required courses and the creation of a new College-wide quantitative reasoning requirement. The committee is expected to bring a formal set of recommendations to the Faculty at its December meeting.
Professors so far have been at the front of the debate, although the UC’s Education Committee worked with Kelly to organize student-administrator town halls to solicit additional student opinions on the program last school year. The committee also issued a survey to undergraduates last school year that included questions that—per Kelly’s suggestion, according to Ely—asked about Gen Ed.
The survey’s results, Ely said, found that while “students want more freedom in their course selection, generally people like the idea of a Gen Ed program.” Speaking for himself, Ely said he views the most recently discussed plans positively.
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the Council’s vice president and its former Education Committee chair, said he was appreciative of Kelly and his committee’s considerations of Gen Ed’s shortcomings.

Expert and student panelists contemplated the struggles in the quest for the eradication of polio, a disease that now prevails only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, in a panel discussion Monday evening organized by the Harvard Global Health Systems Cluster.
Three short clips from the documentary Every Last Child—a dramatic portrayal of the struggle of five individuals impacted by the current polio crisis in Pakistan—served as prompts for the discussion. As they reflected on the film, panelists discussed the emotional tax of caring for a child with polio, the reasoning behind Pakistan’s rejection of the polio vaccine, and the dangers associated with administration of the vaccine.
Between clips, moderator Joseph R. Fitchett, student at the School of Public Health, garnered the perspectives of expert panelists: professor Richard A. Cash, professor Svea Closser of Middlebury College, professor Rifat A. Atun, and the student panelists from the School of Public Health and the Kennedy School of Government.
Reported cases of polio, an infectious waterborne disease, have steadily fallen from 350,000 in 1998 to 223 in 2012. However, as the panelists discussed, increasing pressures to reject vaccination for religious and other sociopolitical reasons have stagnated efforts to achieve the end goal of global eradication.
Both Cash and the film attributed the unwillingness to vaccinate to a skepticism that emerged from the perceived contradiction between the U.S.’s eagerness to contribute to polio vaccination in Pakistan and the U.S.’s use of drone strikes in the country. Cash and the film said that many locals simply do not trust western medicine when it is only offered in the exclusive circumstance of polio vaccination.
Atun, director of the Global Health Systems Cluster and a professor at the School of Public Health, spoke about the necessity of raising awareness about the progress of polio eradication.
“We are so close to the finish line, yet we are not there,” Atun said. “I thought that the meeting tonight and the panel would highlight the achievements, but also the challenges we face in achieving this last mile.”
Obiageli Okafor, a student panelist, spoke favorably about the role Harvard can play in the final stages of polio eradication and how campaigns can tackle the skepticism that has stymied vaccination.
“Achieving the final stage of eradication will rely heavily on the quality of local health systems, and Harvard is very good at developing health systems,” she said. “If Harvard can actually collaborate with the governments in Pakistan and Afghanistan to build up the systems so that the polio vaccine can actually be integrated into their health systems, that would actually go a long way.”
Monday’s discussion drew audience members from across the Harvard community as well as distinguished guests, ranging from diplomats of the Consulate General of the United Arab Emirates to the Associate Producer of Every Last Child Rebekah Clark.

Jameela Pedicini, the inaugural vice president of sustainable investing at the Harvard Management Company, will depart in December for the New York-based Perella Weinberg Partners.
HMC chief executive officer Stephen Blyth told colleagues about Pedicini’s upcoming departure in an email Monday.
Pedicini, who will leave HMC after just two and a half years, departs after her department suffered criticism from environmental groups over the Management Company’s steadfast refusal to divest the endowment, now valued at $37.6 billion, from the fossil fuel industry.
In her new role, Pedicini will work within Perella Weinberg as the director of sustainable investment strategies for Perella Weinberg Partners Agility, a division that works with foundations, endowments, and not-for-profits to manage their investments.
Prior to heading up the sustainable investing office within HMC, Pedicini spent 18 months as an investment officer at the California Public Employees' Retirement System. CalPERS is the nation’s largest public pension fund with assets of more than $300 billion and manages pensions and health benefits for more than 1.6 million people.
In an email announcing the move, Blyth praised Pedicini’s efforts during her tenure at Harvard.
“During her two years at HMC, Jameela has strengthened our ability to assess portfolio risks related to sustainability, was instrumental in establishing Harvard’s engagement with the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, and liaised closely with the University’s committees on shareholder responsibility,” Blyth said. “The issues of sustainability and ESG risk management will only become more important for HMC.”
Benjamin A. Franta, a Ph.D. student and alumni coordinator for the environmental advocacy group Divest Harvard, gave Pedicini cautious praise in an email.
“While she was at Harvard, Ms. Pedicini was cordial and professional with us students, even as we urged the Harvard Corporation and Harvard Management Company to revise their fossil fuel investment policies,” he wrote. He suggested that Pedicini’s move to Perella Weinberg Partners Agility, which recently facilitated fossil fuel divestment for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, could be a sign of positive trends within the investment industry toward fossil fuel divestment.
Last spring, Divest Harvard engaged in a series of public protests calling for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry. The campaign was capped by what organizers dubbed their “Heat Week,” a week-long blockade of administrative offices at Massachusetts Hall in Harvard Yard. Despite the barricade, University President Drew G. Faust worked at other offices around campus, including the Smith Campus Center, rather than choose to support divesting the endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 10, 2015, at 2:15 p.m. 
University President Drew G. Faust made a series of appearances in the southeastern United States last week as part of her ongoing “Your Harvard” fundraising tour, emphasizing the impact of higher education and Harvard’s role in combating societal issues like housing and racial inequality.
In addition to at least two policy-oriented speeches, Faust addressed a gathering of more than 350 Harvard alumni and affiliates in Atlanta on the topic of “Education as a Civil Right.” During her speech, Faust recalled skipping exams to travel to Selma, Ala., to join Civil Rights protesters in 1965, an experience she drew upon multiple times during her trip. 
The event, entitled “Your Harvard: Atlanta,” is the latest in a string of large alumni-centric fundraising events tied to Harvard’s record-seeking capital campaign. Faust has also traveled internationally to Mexico City and London, and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jingping in Beijing. She has also taken trips to Chicago, Dallas, New York City, and Los Angeles, all to raise money.
These efforts have helped Harvard raise $6.1 billion, more than 90 percent of the campaign’s $6.5 billion goal, which would be a higher education fundraising record if reached.
Two Harvard professors, Meira Levinson and Roland G. Fryer, Jr., joined Faust in Atlanta for a panel discussion on the future and goals of the American education system. Mary Louise Kelly ’93, a journalist for National Public Radio and a former Crimson editor, moderated the panel.
Levinson said her interest in education policy and her background in Atlanta probably earned her an invitation to the event.
“President Faust sent me a note and asked me if I would do it. I used to teach in the Atlanta Public Schools,” Levinson, a Graduate School of Education professor, said in an interview. She added attendees seemed excited about the event.
Faust made two other public appearances during her trip. At Duke in North Carolina, Faust—a Civil War historian—discussed the legacy of pioneering African-American history scholar John Hope Franklin as part of a series of speakers marking the 100th anniversary of his birth.
She described the importance of the study of history in affecting social change.
“For John Hope Franklin, history was a calling and a weapon, a passion and a project,” Faust said in a statement. “Fundamental to the task at hand would be to revise the ‘hallowed’ falsehoods, to illustrate how the abuse and misuse of history served to legitimate systems of oppression not just in the past but in the present as well.”
Faust also connected Franklin’s work to the current nationwide debate about race relations, and said Americans must remember their “shameful legacy.”
Along with her speech in North Carolina, Faust spoke in Atlanta with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro for the 50th anniversary of Castro’s department. Castro is a Harvard Law School alumnus.
“Universities are building the framework of opportunity that HUD sees as a goal,” Faust said.

Sex Week is officially underway on Harvard’s campus. The weeklong program, coordinated by the student-run group Sexual Health Education and Advocacy throughout Harvard College, is open to the public and looks to foster thought-provoking conversations about sex and sexuality, according to organizers.
The week kicked off with a film screening at Holden Chapel on Sunday. Since then, the group has held two more events, and nine more are scheduled before the week’s close next Saturday.
“Conversations during Sex Week are often determined by the people who come into the room,” said Kirin Gupta ’16, a SHEATH board member. “This year, so far, there’s been a much broader audience than in previous years. I think this is a sign of the evolving discourse on sex and intimacy on campus.”
The most recent Sex Week event, titled “Feeling Myself: Conversations About Masturbation,” took place Monday night in the Women’s Center Lounge in Canaday Hall's basement. Gupta and Sofia Escudero ‘16, an intern at the Women’s Center, led the discussion. The group explored topics including attendees’ experiences with sex education, societal conceptions of virginity, and how the transition from high school to college affected participants’ abilities to speak openly about things like sexuality and masturbation.
Kylie Pratt, an undergraduate at Simmons College, spoke about how collegiate life offers more opportunities for frank, honest discussion than life in high school. She said it was taboo to mention masturbation throughout her childhood in rural Maine.
Octavious Talbot, a Harvard graduate student, agreed. “Women in particular seem more open to these types of discussions in college,” he said.
The next Sex Week event, a sexual health career panel, will take place in Ticknor Lounge at 4 p.m. on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley earned Athlete of the Week honors by guiding Harvard football to a 24-16 win over Columbia on Saturday. The freshman wide receiver caught eight passes for 131 yards and added an 86-yard punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Aside from Shelton-Mosley’s impact on the gridiron, three other Crimson had crucial performances in their teams’ wins.
Jimmy Vesey, Men’s Ice Hockey
The co-captain scored twice and added an assist in Harvard’s 5-2 win over Brown at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. This marked the 11th two-goal game in his career. In the first period, Vesey netted a shorthanded goal, and he tallied another in the second on a 3-on-2. The North Reading, Mass. native assisted Kyle Criscuolo on his third-period goal. Vesey’s three points equaled the team’s margin of victory in the win over the Bears, and his effort led the Crimson to its third win of the season. The senior forward is averaging a goal and an assist per game so far this year.
Michael Innocenzi, Men’s Soccer
The senior forward’s two goals proved to be the difference as Harvard beat Columbia, 2-0, on the road Saturday. In the 62nd minute, sophomore midfielder Sam Brown played a corner kick into the box, and Innocenzi was able to guide the ball past the keeper to give the Crimson its first goal of the contest. Later in the second half, Innocenzi doubled Harvard’s lead with another header off a pass from senior midfielder Tim Schmoll. These two goals marked the first brace of Innocenzi’s four-year career at Harvard. In 16 games played this season, the Franklin Lakes, N.J. native has four goals, including two game-winning goals.
Karly Heffernan, Women’s Ice Hockey
Over the weekend, Heffernan recorded four assists in two Crimson wins, extending the team’s current winning streak to three. In the Crimson’s 3-2 win over Yale, the sophomore forward assisted on both of freshman forward Grace Zarzecki’s goals. The next day, Heffernan picked up another pair of assists in Harvard’s defeat of Brown, 5-1. After the two weekend games, Heffernan increased her point streak to three games, and she has tallied all of her season-total five assists during that span. In six games this year, the native of Sherwood Park, Alberta has six points, including one goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a successful week for former Harvard athletes this past week across a number of professional leagues. Here are just a few of the former Crimson standouts who featured heavily over the past seven days:
Ryan Fitzpatrick (QB, New York Jets - NFL)
Ryan Fitzpatrick, who quarterbacked the 2004 Harvard football team to an undefeated, Ancient Eight championship season, has blossomed under offensive coordinator Chan Gailey this season, leading the New York Jets to a 5-3 record through eight games.
Fitzpatrick, dealt from Houston to the Jets this offseason, put in a gritty performance this weekend, leading New York to a 28-23 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars despite playing with a torn ligament in his thumb. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns, continuing to find chemistry with wideouts Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall.
The former Ivy League MVP will likely have in-season surgery to repair his thumb, but doctors have suggested he may not have to miss any games as a result.
Jeremy Lin (PG, Charlotte Hornets - NBA)
Former Harvard men’s basketball star Jeremy Lin, one of the newest member of the Charlotte Hornets, has found stability in North Carolina after several years in limbo. He signed a two-year deal with the Hornets after playing out the final year of his contract in Los Angeles last season, where he was in and out of the starting lineup for the 25-win Lakers.
After the run in New York that brought Lin national media attention, this campaign has been his most stable to date. He is firmly entrenched as Kemba Walker’s backup at the point guard spot, and the Crimson alum is averaging 24.9 points, 8.0 assists, and 6.8 rebounds per 48 minutes in his new role. He has played a key part in Charlotte’s recent resurgence, as they’ve now won two of three after losing their first three contests.
Cameron Brate (TE, Tampa Bay Buccaneers - NFL)
A two-time All-Ivy League honoree during his time in Cambridge, Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate has featured more heavily on the stat sheet in his second professional season. The Naperville, I.L. native has fiv e receptions for 78 yards this season, including a diving, 17-yard grab this sunday from Jameis Winston to earn the Bucs a key first down. Despite Brate’s effort, Tampa Bay still lost, 32-18, to the New York Giants.
Alexander Killorn (C, Tampa Bay Lightning - NHL)
Former Harvard men’s ice hockey standout Alexander Killorn has carved out a nice role for himself this season with last year’s runner-up Lightning. After notching 32 goals and 47 assists over the last two seasons centering Tampa Bay’s third line, Killorn has two goals and three assists thus far this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Just two scores ahead of a completely revamped Columbia squad heading into the fourth quarter, the Harvard football team needed to start off the period strong to put the game out of reach.
With the team comprised of mainly veteran players, it would seem that upperclassmen would be the likely candidates to lead the charge. But freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley—the only rookie starter for the Crimson on either side of the ball—was the outlet that provided that much-needed cushion.
After catching a low-liner of a punt from Columbia’s Cameron Nizialek on the first play of the fourth quarter, the rookie sprinted, powered, and juked his way down the left sideline on his way to taking the ball to the house.
Although Shelton-Mosley’s fumble on a fair catch attempt late in the second quarter threatened to dampen his afternoon, the late touchdown made up for the previous mistake and more. The Crimson now had a commanding lead, 24-3. The return would ultimately be a major factor in the end result of the game, as the Lions put up two scores later in the fourth to bring the game within one touchdown.
This 86-yard punt return, the third longest in Harvard’s history, proved why Shelton-Mosley was tabbed the College Sports Madness Preseason National Freshman of the Year. Shelton-Mosley showcased his entire skill arsenal on the run—at one point, he emerged from a horde of Columbia defenders in a show of strength, and at another, he displayed his elusiveness by juking out the competition.
The Sacramento, Calif. native seemed to be in his element returning punts and kicks in relief of senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer, who was out this past weekend with a hamstring injury.
“Week in and week out, coach Craw[ford] puts us in a great position for punt returns,” Shelton-Mosley said. “It was just natural, I can’t explain what happened, it’s just me playing football since I was younger, a natural process.”
Shelton-Mosley was not exclusively limited to this defining moment, however, as he was a key cog in the Crimson’s offense on the day as well.
As one of the two main outlets for senior quarterback Scott Hosch, the rookie racked up a touchdown and 131 yards through the air from Hosch. This performance led STATS to declare him FCS National Freshman Player of the Week.
“The way defense was holding up in coverage, and the way they were battling up front, we had to earn every yard,” Hosch said. “And for those two guys to make plays like that, shake a couple of tackles and get in the end zone…it makes my job easier.”
With the Harvard offense driving down the field late in the opening half and only up, 7-0, Shelton-Mosley was able to demonstrate this ability. He turned a simple catch into a huge gain by quickly slashing towards the sideline, forcing two misses by Columbia defenders, and diving for the corner of the end zone for a 26-yard score.
Although clearly an outstanding player in his own right, Shelton-Mosley placed praise upon his teammates for taking Columbia’s attention away from him with their own stellar play, thus affording him the opportunity to produce this type of performance. Senior Ben Braunecker, who leads the Ivy League in receiving touchdowns, fell just shy of Shelton-Mosley on Saturday, racking up 130 yards and a score of his own on the day despite drawing double coverage for most of the game.
“We just have a lot of weapons and it all plays into it,” Shelton-Mosley said.
Harvard does indeed have playmakers at each and every position on the field, but the rookie receiver still managed to shine against the Lions.
“As a freshman, [Shelton-Mosley] certainly has done a great job,” said first-year Columbia coach Al Bagnoli. “Let’s give credit to the kid. He’s a pretty dynamic playmaker.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long offseason layoff, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing squads travelled to Penn State to compete in the Garret Penn State Open, which saw Harvard fencers competing as individuals in a crowded field. Despite competing with what junior foil fencer Stephen Mageras described as one of the smallest collegiate teams in the field, the Crimson had a few solid performances in the season’s first competition.
Women’s Fencing
Continuing the trend from previous years, the strength of the women’s saber squad—namely junior saber fencer Adrienne Jarocki and senior teammate Aliya Itzkowitz, was on full display. Jarocki took second in the women’s saber competition after Itzkowitz defeated her in the final bout, 15-14, while freshman foil fencer Liana Henderson-Semel also took third in her first collegiate tournament.
“They pretty much sailed through their first [direct elimination] bouts,” junior foil fencer Liana Yamin said. “They’re both fencing really well, and their level of talent is just so far above the competition…. That kind of shows in most of the competitions that we go to, and this weekend too.”
The final direct elimination bout between the the two saber teammates was reminiscent of the 2014 NCAA Championship final between the two Harvard fencers, but with the opposite result. As opposed to the 2014 bout that saw Jarocki take the title by a 15-10 score, this time around it was Itzkowitz who had the last laugh in a 15-14 nailbiter.
On different strips, freshman foil fencer Liana Henderson-Semel earned a tie for third place result after winning her first two direct elimination bouts.
“In her first fall tournament [Henderson-Semel] had a really good showing,” Yamin said. “[The tournament] was really mentally and physically exhausting, but she held up really well and had really good stamina—[she] didn’t lose her focus.”
Rounding out the top showings for the women, freshman epeeist Shawn Wallace came close to running the tables in her first collegiate tournament and ended up in second after dropping her final direct elimination bout of the tournament.
“[Wallace] sailed through some of her [direct elimination bouts] that should have been really difficult because [her opponents were] really impressive fencers,” Yamin said.
Men’s Fencing
With co-captain Michael Woo still out due to a hand injury and senior Jerry Chang competing in a tournament abroad in Tokyo, Japan, Harvard sent only two foil fencers to the event, including Mageras, who tied for third after winning his table of 16 and table of eight direct elimination bouts before falling to eventual foil winner Kristjan Archer of Notre Dame.
“I think we performed great, considering the circumstances,” Mageras said. “We have a few injuries [and] fencers are away travelling for international competition…but despite not having those fencers there, I think we had a solid performance.”
Along the way to his semifinals run, Mageras defeated Nobuo Bravo of Penn State, who was the top seed coming into the direct elimination bouts after a strong pool play showing.
In the epee bracket, senior epeeist Peregrine Badger set himself up for success by finishing pool play in the first-seeded driver’s seat. However, a 15-13 loss in the table of 16 to the Fighting Irish’s Cole Mallette resulted in Badger’s day ending earlier than desired. Classmate Nicolas Simko emerged from pool play seeded third in the field of 54 competitors before losing in the table of eight to finish fifth for his tournament.
Sophomore Eric Zhao was the top saber finisher for the Crimson on the day, winning his table of 16 bout against the Nittany Lions’ Adam Lewicki by a 15-11 score before dropping a 15-13 bout against eventual finalist Freddy Koch of Ohio State.
Co-captain Duncan O’Brien finished 16th after drawing a tough first round direct elimination bout with one of the top-seeded competitors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Two years ago, in the postgame press conference of the Harvard-Columbia football tilt, the Lions players shuffled dejectedly into the press room of the Baker Athletic Complex. When asked about the 34-0 loss to the Crimson, they mumbled halfhearted answers about moral victories and finishing the season.
A year later, rinse and repeat, this time at the Murr Center in Cambridge, Mass., this time following a 45-0 loss to Harvard, and this time—if possible—giving even terser answers after 19 games without a win.
On Saturday, the winner and loser didn’t change. But those were about the only things that remained the same in the 2015 rendition of the Harvard versus Columbia matchup to the past three years, routs that had a combined score of 148 Crimson, 0 Lions.
When quarterback Anders Hill, defensive back Matt Cahal, and wide receiver Scooter Hollis walked into the Baker Athletic Complex press room Saturday, their heads were held high. They talked about no longer accepting moral victories, of a confidence in their team to go into any situation and win, no matter the opponent.
I’m sorry, do these guys even play for Columbia? If I hadn’t been following the team’s progress through the year and watching the past 60 minutes of football on the gridiron, I might not have believed that Hill, Cahal, and Hollis were a part of the same Lions team that had become the butt of many jokes about Ancien Eight football, or at the very least were just spouting nonsense.
But anyone who has watched this year’s Columbia unit (2-6, 1-4 Ivy) can attest to Hill’s statement that this squad, despite its losing record and poor play in recent team history, could probably take on any conference team and come away with a win.
Indeed, this 24-16 nail-biter was the most competitive game Harvard (7-0, 5-0) has been in all year with the exception of last week’s last second victory over then-undefeated Dartmouth.
Even with the Lions’ relative success this year—a win over Yale the week before, and a near-victory over the Big Green, two preseason projected powerhouses of the Ancient Eight—I was unconvinced that this was going to be anything different from the absolute massacres I witnessed in the past few years.
In fact, it looked like Saturday’s contest was going to follow the trend of the blowouts of years past when the Crimson pulled ahead, 24-3, on an 86-yard punt return touchdown from rookie Justice Shelton-Mosley early in the fourth quarter.
And then, the comeback commenced. Columbia’s defense held fast for two straight three-and-out stops, while the offense put together two scoring drives in the final quarter, closing the gap to eight.
Save a 12-man substitution penalty, and the Lions would have had the ball back with a minute left on the clock and the chance to march down the field to tie the game. With the top defense in the league stymied by Columbia’s no-huddle offense on the previous drive, who knows what would have happened had the punt play stood, penalty-free?
But the penalty did happen, the forced punt turned into a first down, and Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch took two knees to run down the clock. Another victory against Columbia, and the Harvard win streak lived on to see another week, but this one almost felt like a victory for the desperate Lions, too.
Gone was the anemic defense that had allowed past Crimson squads to score at will.
Columbia’s defensive front seven controlled the line throughout the whole game, forcing this Harvard offense—arguably one of the most potent in school history, averaging nearly 40 points per game coming into Saturday’s matchup—to all but abandon its run game and forcing quarterback Scott Hosch to pass outside.
Gone was the stagnant offense that had failed to score since 2011. While the Lions’ attack was far from polished, it was a far cry from the units of past Columbia squads that would post drives of negative yardage as often as not.
The 16 points Saturday outpaced all but one of the Crimson’s other opponents this season, Brown, most of whose 27 points in week two came against Harvard’s second-string defense.
Maybe you can chalk the stark contrast in the 2015 Columbia team I saw Saturday up to a coaching overhaul at Columbia that brought in previous Penn coach Al Bagnoli to replace Pete Mangurian, as well as a new secondary coach.
Maybe you can chalk it up to the experience of the Lions’ veteran defensive line, or the injection of fresh blood with the transfer of former-Florida quarterback junior Skyler Mornhinweg.
Or maybe, you can the chalk it up to the momentum from an upset road win over an injury-riddled Yale team on Oct. 31.
Whatever it was, one thing is for sure: this year’s Columbia football team has gained an intangible, apparent in the swagger on the field after an open-field tackle or blocked punt, and definitely apparent in the way the players strode into the postgame press conference.
The Lions aren’t going to be the 2015 Ivy League Champions. They won’t unseat Harvard at the top. But they’re a heck of a lot closer than they’ve been in a long time.

As the temperature finally drops and midterm season comes back, the need for warmth and caffeine becomes more and more urgent. While many, including myself, swear by coffee, there exists a portion of students who are swayed more by tea. This less popular and often less caffeinated drink seems to be overshadowed by the power that the java has, especially during days when you need to finish a paper at 4 am. While coffeehouses are too numerous to count, locations to experience something other than the HUDS-provided English Breakfast or Green Tea are limited. To find these places and fully experience the joy of drinking unique teas, I gave up coffee for a weekend and embarked on a tasting of some of the teas Harvard Square provides.
TeaLuxe: Kashmiri Chai
I began my (almost spiritual) journey at one of the few places known specifically for its tea. Surrounded by signs boasting 7 kinds of chai brewed fresh and 90 kinds of loose tea, I felt pleasantly overwhelmed by all of the options unlike when I was choosing courses for the semester.
After some thought, I decided on ordering a cup of Kashmiri Chai, Indian black tea flavored with cardamom, cinnamon, peppermint, and nutmeg. As the server grabbed a numbered black box off a tiered shelf of several others, I was reminded of the Harry Potter scene in which Mr. Ollivander retrieves a wand for the young wizard.
The tea was as magical as the experience. Very delicately spiced, the full flavored black tea was robust but not bitter. The drink was comforting and unique, something anyone, tea-lover or not, would enjoy.
Crema: Almond Earl Grey
The always bustling (but quite expensive) student favorite, Crema was my next stop. The coffee there is always phenomenal, but I sought to answer the question of whether the tea was as exceptional.
While scoping out the tea options, my eye was immediately caught by the Almond Earl Grey option. An avid fan of Earl Grey, I was initially wary about the seemingly trendy twist, but my curiosity was won out. All of my worries about the tea (and also my worries about the piles of readings I still haven’t done for my Gen Ed class), were somehow diminished after the first sip. The flavor was multi-layered; the sweetness of the almond syrup was seamlessly undercut by the tea itself. It was a warming, balanced tea experience.
L. A. Burdicks: Maracuja Orange
Better known for its heavenly and very expensive liquid chocolate, this famously decadent location also has a decent, though not expansive, selection of tea. As tempted as I was to abandon my consumption of only tea (and add on those last pounds to finally gain my freshman fifteen), I persevered. In fact, I opted for what could serve as the exact opposite of creamy chocolate: a fruity, herbal tea.
Though I was expecting a lighter flavor, I was surprised by how much citrus came through even after very minimal steeping. It was by no means an unpleasant surprise, but the powerful orange element could have been complemented by something a bit more sweet.
Peet’s: Spiced Hot Tea Cider
For my last taste of tea, I decided to try a fall-themed option at Peet’s, which also specializes in coffee. Special holiday drinks, advertised by coffee shops on chalkboards in Santa-hat topped handwriting underneath cheerfully sketched branches of mistletoe, often tend to be hit or miss. The Spiced Hot Tea Cider there was an instant and resounding miss.
Each individual element was so promising. Cider? Yum. Hot Tea? Perfect for a crisp day. Spices? I’m all about that extra kick. Spiced cider is good; so is spiced tea. Putting the two together, however, served to create an aggressively weird clash of flavor like pumpkin spiced chicken. Initially, my tongue was assaulted by an overly-saturated cinnamon sweetness, only to be given a finishing blow by an unusual, uncomplimentary bitterness. I had to throw it away right afterwards.
Conclusion
After exploring some of the tea options in Harvard Square, I realized just how accessible it really is. Though, you might not plan to rely on tea for that last-minute boost on late-night assignments, you should try it once in awhile. It could be great for more leisurely occasions, like cuddling up in your dorm room after a long class in Sever or while strolling in the Yard, blanketed by brown leaves. There are so many new teas to try, and hopefully, I’ll get a taste of most of them.

Recently, Starbucks removed Christmas trees from their holiday cups. Because this event is on par with the massive changes concerning the overhaul of the gen-ed program at Harvard and the renaming of the new SEAS school, it’s important to ask the questions: is this a catastrophe? Improvement? Not a big deal? Flyby investigated Harvard freshmen’s opinions on this pressing and important change to find out:
Akash Wasal ‘19 felt “mostly apathy with a twinge of support.” He felt that it was a good move that Starbucks was explicitly reaching out to other religions by removing the Christmas tree from the cups, but that it wouldn’t have been bad if they had decided to keep the tree because Christmas has become secularized.
Regarding Starbucks’ move, Irene Saksom ‘19 said, “I think it’s completely justified,” voicing similar opinions to Wasal ‘19 in regarding Christmas as a secularized holiday. Saksom also believed that there was no reason for Starbucks to celebrate one category of people or religion over others.
Although she considers herself a Starbucks frequenter, Jessica Li ‘19 was not very aware of the change in the cup when I brought up the subject. “A lot of trends are moving that way,” she said, describing Starbucks as following the “nondenominational trend.” Although she had no strong opinion on the change, she said she could see both sides of the issue. She imagined that one side would say that the removal of the tree was “excessive.” What were the operational costs in changing the design? But on the other hand, Li believed that this move demonstrates that Starbucks is more accepting of different religions and cultures.
It appears that Harvard students feel surprisingly neutral and even somewhat supportive of the change. Indeed, as the debate rages on throughout the rest of the country, we may comfort ourselves with the fact that, adorned with a Christmas tree or not, there is still coffee in our cups.

Hi Harvard, we hope you have an eventful and thrilling Tuesday—they usually aren’t, but you never know. November 10ths tend to be pretty exciting, though: in 1871, Henry Morton Stanley found the missing explorer and missionary Dr. David Livingstone in Ujiji, famously greeting him with the words, “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” Perhaps you, too, could stumble across a long-lost explorer today.

Unless you live under a rock– or should we say, are *above* the Harvard social scene - you might have noticed by now that email invites for Friday or Saturday night parties are a way of life. As the saying goes (read: no saying goes like this), the nicer the invite, the more *exclusive* the event. The most special email of them all? A Paperless Post invite, of course.
Perhaps grasping this important concept of a sparkly, seemingly personalized message for viewing and subsequent attendance, the Harvard Social Committee for the Class of 2018 sent out invitations via Paperless Post for their declaring-concentration event on Monday: “Be There. Be Declared.” Besides the flashy invite that reminds students that they will have to confront the helpful and fun my.harvard tool by the end of the week, the event promises to be a fun one: there will be a waffle bar, desserts, “free swag,” and a photo booth that will allow you to look like you actually go out sometimes.
