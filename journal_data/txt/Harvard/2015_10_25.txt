After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 25, 2015, at 10:53 p.m.
Harvard Law School raised $241 million of its $305 million of its goal during the quiet phase of its capital campaign, which launched with fanfare on Friday evening.
James A. Attwood, one of the co-chairs of the campaign, announced the total Friday during the fundraising drive’s public launch, a day-long series of events featuring University President Drew G. Faust and Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, a New Yorker writer, CNN analyst, and former Crimson sports editor. Also announced at the launch event was the school’s decision to rename the Berkman Center for Internet and Society to the Berkman-Klein Center in honor of a $15 million gift from alumnus Michael R. Klein, the chairman of the Sunlight Foundation.
Titled the “Campaign for the Third Century,” the fundraising effort will focus on clinical education and financial aid for students. The Law School recently finished a capital campaign in 2008, when it raised $476 million, surpassing its $400 million goal. Because of the proximity to its last fundraising drive, the Law School is the last of Harvard’s schools to launch its part of the University-wide Harvard Campaign, which kicked off publicly in 2013 and seeks to raise $6.5 billion.
In addition to a later launch, the Law School set a lower fundraising goal than its last campaign. The Law School also started reaching out to a broader set of donors during the “quiet phase” of the campaign, breaking from the traditional fundraising strategy of courting the wealthiest donors before the public launch, according to Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean of development and alumni affairs.
Attwood recognized the early success in his remarks.
“For those of you who have been involved in campaigns in the past, you don’t usually start with 80 percent in the bag,” he said.
Throughout Friday, the Law School’s fundraising priorities were on display, illustrating the campaign’s effort to rebrand the school as being more student-friendly than when many of its alumni-donors were students there.
Directly confronting the hostile image the school seeks to overcome, campaign organizers invited to speak John Jay Osborn ’67, author of “The Paper Chase,” a novel-turned-film that follows several Harvard Law School students as they navigate the oftentimes hostile first year of law school.
Together with his daughter Meredith B. Osborn ’02, who also graduated from the Law School and is a former Crimson editor, he discussed just how different the Law School is now than it was in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, when many of the alumni present were students.
“Although Harvard Law School has always been a very challenging place, that challenge has become a much more positive challenge and less a fearful one over the years,” Meredith Osborn said.
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow also displayed an eagerness to move beyond the image of the Law School as an impersonal and unhappy place. “More than half the courses that we offer today have fewer than 25 students—take that, John Jay Osborn,” she said.
Other speakers Friday also highlighted advances the Law School has made and seeks to further through its campaign, including financial aid. Increasing financial assistance is the top priority of the Law School’s fundraising drive.
Bianca S. Tylek, a third year Law student, gave an emotional speech, discussing her difficult youth and the importance of financial assistance as she pursues a career in corrections.
“I couldn’t have done that all without the support of generous alumni like Irwin and Roberta Schneiderman, whose gift brought me here,” Tylek said.
Following Tylek was Jonathan L. Zittrain, a Law professor who also has appointments at the Kennedy School of Government and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He discussed his childhood as a technology aficionado and the technological and entrepreneurial experience at the Law School.
“That’s the kind of the place this is, that’s the kind of enthusiasm that is so infectious,” Zittrain said.
Throughout the day, speakers also touched on the general merits of a Law School education in the context of a troubled legal and toxic political environment. Opening the day’s events, United States Senator Mark R. Warner discussed policy problems in Washington, and, unsurprisingly, the importance of a law degree for addressing those ills.
For her part, Faust discussed the history of the Law School, whose bicentennial falls in 2017, and its ongoing importance.
“We need the Law School and the extraordinary leaders it creates. We need the clarity that it brings to confusing and divisive times. We need its capacity to civilize, and we need lawyers wise in their calling,” she said.
The Law School’s campaign will close in 2018—when Harvard’s University-wide drive is expected to conclude—making its public phase two years shorter than the Harvard Campaign. At the launch event, there was full confidence that this would pose no problem.
“As type As and overachievers, as we all are, we’re going to blow through that gap, guarantee it,” Attwood said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parading down the streets of Harvard Square in a purple and yellow Roman chariot on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard Lampoon crowned comedian and “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon the “Emperor of Comedy.”
The semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine presented Fallon with the Elmer Award for Excellence in Humor on Saturday following a brief parade that began at the Inn at Harvard, proceeded down Massachusetts Avenue, and concluded at the steps of the Lampoon. There, Fallon was roasted and officially given the award.
 Along the route, members of the Lampoon fanned the laurel-crowned Fallon with palm leaves, while crowds of excited fans lined the streets snapping selfies and holding up signs. During a short stop, Fallon autographed two signs that read “Yaasss Jimmy” and “Werk Jimmy Werk.”
Standing next to Fallon in the white Clydesdale-guided chariot were Calvin W. Willett ’16 and Sierra L. Katow ’16, president and ibis of the Lampoon, respectively. The Belmont High School band and the Harvard Crimson dance team led the procession, and two additional chariots, one carrying a jester and the other a panda-suited ’Poonster, followed the honoree.
Upon arriving at the Lampoon’s Bow Street castle, Fallon exited the chariot and joined members of the Lampoon on the steps overlooking a crowd of several hundred people. Among the crowd of onlookers stood both students and parents, who descended on Cambridge for Freshman Parents Weekend.
Playing off Fallon's “Tonight Show” tradition of writing irreverent and witty thank-you notes, Katow presented a series of “sorry” notes, to which Fallon said, “I’m thankful that you’re sorry.”
Following that spoof, members of the Lampoon stepped up to the microphone and weighed in with their thoughts on who the real Jimmy Fallon is. “People love Jimmy because he’s the boy next door,” one ’Poonster declared. “He’s the boy next door who has us have a massive Roman-style parade for him and insists on being called the ‘Emperor of Comedy.’”
“When Jimmy told his parents that he was going to be hosting a late-night show, they made him promise that he wouldn’t be up a minute past 12:30 at night,” another ’Poonster joked.
Before receiving the main award, Fallon was given a series of smaller prizes. First, the Lampoon awarded him a giant check, for 85 cents, to which Fallon said, “I could get a sugar packet at Starbucks. This is amazing,” adding that he had “a giant wallet [he] could put that in."
Fallon then received a fake diploma, which jokingly read “James ‘Jimmy’ Kimmel,” and a Lampoon necktie. Finally, he earned the Elmer Award. Previous recipients include Jay Leno, John Cleese, and Robin Williams, among others.
Fallon accepted the award, and before retreating into the Castle with members of the Lampoon, concluded the festivities with a short speech.
“This is a great day for me, but it’s a greater day for the Harvard Lampoon,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 26, 2015, at 2:41 a.m.
The Fox Club, one of Harvard’s eight male final clubs, has accepted a group of junior and senior women into its membership, making it the second of the off-campus social organizations this fall to move to go co-ed.
An email message carrying the subject line “The Future of the Fox Club” and obtained by The Crimson early Sunday morning told prospective members of the club that a “group” of women had joined its membership and that it intended to “transition to a fully co-ed club over the next year.”
“Earlier this year, after much discussion and deliberation, the undergraduate members of the Fox Club decided to open our membership to women,” said the message, signed by the “President and Members of the Fox Club” and sent from the email account foxclubpresident@gmail.com. “A group of junior and senior women have accepted an offer of membership and, in their capacity as members, will be advising our transition to a fully co-ed club over the next year.”
Several current undergraduate officers of the Fox, which was founded in 1898 and is located at 44 John F. Kennedy St., could not be immediately be reached for comment early Sunday morning.
The Fox’s move comes six weeks after the Spee Club, another male final club based on Mount Auburn Street, voted to invite women to participate in its punch process, an annual rite in which the groups put prospective members up for entry each fall. It is unclear whether the Spee has formally admitted any women into its membership; the punch process is ongoing.
The Spee’s decision, which attracted national media attention and drew praise from administrators, came on the heels of mounting scrutiny of the final clubs, which have been officially unrecognized by Harvard since 1984, when they chose to sever ties with the University rather than admit women.
Top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, have recently criticized the all-male organizations on grounds of gender exclusivity and the potential for alcohol abuse and sexual assault to occur on their off-campus properties. In the face of this scrutiny, many clubs have gone quiet; last spring, the Fox decided to tighten its membership rules, reinforcing a no-guest policy.
“The College continues to support the idea that…single-gendered organizations are not appropriate for the College,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said earlier this year.
The Fox’s decision to add women to its membership also follows previous attempts by undergraduate members to persuade their graduate board counterparts to change the club’s gender makeup. Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, the president of the Fox’s graduate board, did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday, but he said last year that conversations over the club going co-ed were not new.
At that time, Sears said the Fox had no plans to admit women anytime in the near future. When one undergraduate club member was leading a move for the Fox to invite women to participate in the punch process in fall 2014, Sears directed him to write a position paper on the proposal’s implications and potential outcomes.
“The undergraduates of the Fox Club can vote on whatever they want to, but that doesn’t necessarily leave anything other than expressed opinion,” Sears said.
It remains unclear whether the Fox’s graduate board has approved the club’s move to add women to its membership. Hugh M. Nesbit ’77, the chair of the club’s board of directors, also did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.
In a post on his personal Facebook page, though, Sears acknowledged the club’s move to go co-ed. Sharing an earlier version of this Crimson news story on the change, Sears wrote that unlike other male final clubs that he said have considered merging with female social organizations—there are five all-female final clubs at the College—the Fox “has elected women as members who will help the club's transition to full gender equity over the next three years.”
Students and others on campus also reacted to the news on Sunday. In an email, Khurana wrote that College administrators are “delighted that the student leaders at the Fox and their alumni have taken this important step.”
At least one student who has been critical of male final clubs, meanwhile, also said the Fox’s move represents a positive step. “It’s really exciting to see some students who are becoming self-critical because of the public challenges,” Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 said. “It’s clearly not a bad thing that these clubs are going co-ed.”
Still, Suslovic, who co-authored a Crimson op-ed earlier this year advocating the dismantling of final clubs, said club leaders should host open conversations about how the organizations will operate differently. She added that administrators and students should host additional discussions about inclusive social spaces on campus, irrespective of a final club’s decision to admit women.
Recently, in response to student complaints about the state of the on-campus social scene, administrators have pumped more funding into large undergraduate social events, and some upperclassman Houses recently opened new party spaces.
Others, however, offered a more tempered response.
Mitchell L. Dong ’75, the former vice president of the all-male Fly Club’s graduate board, said he still believes that there is a place for single-gender groups at the College, though he supports groups that want to go co-ed. Dong, who said he was speaking on behalf of himself and not the Fly, suggested that changes within the final clubs will take take time.
“This transition of the final clubs is not going to be something that happens overnight,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 24 years, a familiar name appeared in a Saturday night box score at the Bright.
At 4:57 in the second period of the No. 9/8 Harvard men’s hockey team’s 3-3 tie with the University of New Brunswick, freshman forward Ryan Donato scored on a two-man advantage off a sharp wrist shot from the left faceoff circle. Father-coach Ted Donato ’91 watched with approval from the Crimson bench, perhaps recalling his first goal in a Crimson sweater decades ago.
A physical contest with one of Canada’s top intercollegiate programs, Harvard’s only exhibition game of the 2015-2016 season provided a preview of what might be to come for the younger Donato and a Crimson team that will open NCAA play next weekend with high expectations. Taking his first postgame questions about his son, the elder offered cautious praise.
“I think our power play has some guys who are good with the puck, and I think he fits in well with that group,” said Ted Donato, who is entering his 12th season as Harvard’s head coach. “But I also know there’s a lot to learn there, and in a lot of ways he was much the same as our other guys with little experience, some good and some bad. And hopefully we can get a little more of the good and negate some of the bad.”
Co-captains Kyle Criscuolo and Jimmy Vesey also recorded goals on the power play to secure a 3-1 lead for Harvard before UNB scored twice in the third period, evening the score on a man-advantage goal by Cam Critchlow with under 1:30 to play in regulation. Harvard tested line combinations throughout and rotated goaltenders, with freshman Michael Lackey in net for the first two periods and senior Peter Traber in net for the third.
On a busy night for the NCAA’s reigning goal-scoring king, Vesey tied the game at one with a nifty top-shelf finish at 18:16 in the first period. Criscuolo won an offensive zone face-off to Vesey, who deked and dove across the slot and around UNB goaltender Etienne Marcoux for the score.
“Obviously they hadn’t watched film on us,” Criscuolo laughed. “We probably run that play seven times a game.”
After Donato’s goal gave Harvard the lead early in the second, Vesey followed the act by drawing a five-minute major and game misconduct to the Varsity Red’s Philippe Halley, who grabbed Vesey’s facemask in a line-wide scrum after a whistle. On the ensuing advantage, Vesey found Criscuolo open in the slot to extend the Crimson’s lead to two with under six minutes to play in the second period.
Harvard had opportunities to extend its lead in the third, particularly following a five-minute major and game misconduct to Francis Beauvillier at 10:44, but Marcoux held solid in the face of point-blank chances.
On the other side of the ice, Saturday seemed to provide little in the way of resolving Harvard’s goaltender competition, which Ted Donato has billed as a three-way battle between Lackey, Traber, and sophomore Merrick Madsen.
Lackey yielded UNB’s first shot on goal of the game, an even-strength blast from defenseman Stephen Anderson, yet stopped the Varsity Reds’ next 12 shots on goal. In the third period, UNB’s Rob Mignardi and Critchlow took advantage of a poorly-supported Traber on the power play, yet the senior goaltender made a handful of impressive stops, including one in overtime on a breakaway by Varsity Red defenseman Matt Petgrave. Madsen, meanwhile, played two periods of a closed scrimmage against the University of Prince Edward Island on Friday.
“All three of them have worked really hard in practice, so it’s nice to see them play well,” Ted Donato said. “I know there will be a lot of competition as we go through, and we’ll see how it plays out.”
Saturday also provided a look at Harvard’s defense in the absence of graduates Patrick McNally ’15 and Max Everson ’15-16. Senior Desmond Bergin skated with junior Clay Anderson and senior Brayden Jaw skated with sophomore Wiley Sherman on the Crimson’s top two pairs, while freshmen Jacob Olson and Viktor Dombrovskiy skated on the bottom pair and junior Victor Newell rotated in.
At forward, Harvard’s first line of Vesey, Criscuolo, and junior center Alexander Kerfoot remained in tact, while Ryan Donato slotted into left wing on the second line with junior center Sean Malone and junior Luke Esposito. Sophomore Seb Lloyd received time on the third line with junior Tyler Moy and sophomore Jake Horton. Junior left wing Greg Gozzo, freshman center Joseph Caffrey, and sophomore Phil Zielonka skated on the fourth line with freshman Michael Floodstrand rotating in.
