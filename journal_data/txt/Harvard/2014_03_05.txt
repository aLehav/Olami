“I am very, very happy to announce that for the first time, Dow is accepting full responsibility for the Bhopal catastrophe. We have a $12 billion plan to finally, at long last, fully compensate the victims, including the 120,000 who may need medical care for their entire lives, and to fully and swiftly remediate the Bhopal plant site,” said the supposed Dow Chemical spokesman, Jude Finisterra, on Dec. 3, 2004, during an appearance on BBC World. If this news, aired on the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, sounds too good to be true and too generous for a corporate company like Dow, it’s probably because it was. 
The Bhopal catastrophe Finisterra was referring to was a gas leak in India at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal. In the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 1983, more than half a million people were exposed to toxic substances. Multiple sources report between 3,000 to 11,000 people died as a direct result of the leak, and a government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries. Seven ex-employees of Union Carbide Corporation  were convicted of death by negligence, yet they were sentenced to only two years of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 each. The company eventually agreed to pay $470 million for damages, a mere 15 percent of the amount originally claimed in the lawsuit. In 2001, in the midst of this legal controversy, Dow Chemical Company purchased UCC. After this acquisition, Dow argued that it held no legal responsibility for unresolved lawsuits.
So when the news got out that Dow planned to liquidate its Union Carbide sector to compensate for the victims of the Bhopal disaster, the world was shocked. After two hours of international coverage, Dow responded by issuing a press release outright denying the statement. But the damage was already done—in a mere 23 minutes, Dow’s share price fell 4.24 percent on Frankfurt Stock Exchange, losing the company $2 billion. Soon after the false BBC report aired, Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the social activist group Yes Men, revealed on BBC Radio 4 that he had posed as Finisterra in this hoax. The Yes Men were already notorious for using media to draw attention to social issues—creating a fake website for George Bush during his first presidential campaign and revising his stance on environmental issues. 
When the film about the Yes Men, “The Yes Men Fix the World,” won the Panorama Audience Award at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival, people started to question if the prank was a work of art. Because the video was placed within the context of reality—a news channel—instead of being presented as a parody, the “hoax” cannot be looked at as a simple joke. Why did the Yes Men engineer this incredibly daring and imaginative yet potentially socially problematic prank? What happens when a parody isn’t staged as a joke? And how can this “prank” be considered as a work of art?
In what they call “Identity Correction,” the Yes Men seek to “expos[e], perhaps deviously, the nastiness of powerful evildoers.” They are not simply lying—they are flipping reality and showing what the company should be saying. Donned in a typical white-collar worker’s suit, Bichlbaum appeared on BBC World, usually a trusted source of information. In this interview, Bichlbaum uses the other party’s voice to bring to light the obscured facts. In this video, the Yes Men present a different reality—an imaginary situation that is seen by audiences as something plausible through the medium of their hoax.
This distortion of reality—presenting a different possibility of the world as it could be—can be understood as a form of art. The Yes Men’s BBC stunt shares a common theme of de-contextualization with Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain.” Duchamp submitted a readymade urinal to the exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in 1917. The committee rejected “Fountain” despite its rules that all works would be accepted. However, in Duchamp’s decision to place it in a museum, the urinal lost its original, intended functionality and became a work of art. The Yes Men took this concept further. The hoax used the smooth, seamless surface of reality to substantiate hope; in fact, by impacting the stock market, the video elevated the possibility for retribution to a financial reality. Like in Duchamp’s “Fountain,” the appearance of the news report does not change—it instead offers another version of reality.
But more importantly, the Yes Men’s BBC stunt is a piece of contemporary political art in that it imparts a significant political message through the media. It is through this very medium that the Yes Men enable viewers to take a step back from their perception of the world and doubt the veracity of its appearance. In achieving this feat, the BBC stunt can be looked at as a current, innovative genre of art that blurs the line between the fine arts and media technology.

There’s a subtle art to mastering accents, and it involves knowing a bit about linguistics. I’ve heard friends say they try to do a Jamaican accent but it comes out Indian. Or their Russian accents sound German. If you’re not a language nerd, this might be utterly tedious to you. Then again, it might be worth it. So bear with me to the end, just in case.
 
 
The most important rule of imitating accents is that in order to put on a foreign accent, you have to know something about the speaker’s mother tongue. This doesn’t mean that you have to speak the language, but you do have to know something about the language’s inventory of sounds. Let’s take an example. If you’ve ever heard a person try to put on a Japanese accent, they will probably put in an “l” sound where we would normally use an “r” sound. So the word “right” becomes “light” and so on. This is because native Japanese speakers do not perceive a difference between the “r” sound and the “l” sound. This is not to say that these two sounds do not exist in Japanese—they do exist in some combination. The difference is that in Japanese, the equivalent of the “r” and “l” sounds are not used in contrastive situations—you would never have two words in Japanese that are distinguished only by the "r" and "l" sounds as in English with "rap" and "lap," for example. 
  
There are also sounds in English that, when changed, don’t muddle the meaning of the word. But these sounds are as hard for us to perceive as different as it is for Japanese speakers to perceive the “r” as different from the “l” sound. Take a classic example from linguistics: the words “stop” and “tap.” Both words contain a “t.” You might think that the “t” produces the same sound in both words, but that’s not quite true. Try saying both words and holding a tissue in front of your mouth, and you’ll see that the tissue moves when you pronounce the “t” in “tap” but not when you say the “t” in “stop.” That’s because the “t” in “tap” is aspirated, which means that you release more air from your mouth when saying it. The “t” in stop is not aspirated. Chances are that you’ve never noticed this distinction before, and I bet if you switch the two “t” sounds—put the aspirated “t” into “stop” and vice versa—you’d still have no trouble understanding each word. But get this: those two forms of the “t” sound are as different for Hindi speakers as an “r” and an “l” sound are for English speakers. To use a linguistic term, “r” and “l” are minimal pairs in English, which means that changing just that sound in a word changes the meaning of that word (i.e. “rap” and “lap”).
This all came together for me in a mind-blowing way last week. I was listening to my professor from Brazil talk about the “t” and “ch” sounds in Portuguese. The two sounds are not minimal pairs for Portuguese speakers, meaning that when they are used in the same contexts, their sounds do not change the meaning of a word. While she was explaining these concepts, she was speaking in a Portuguese accent. She said things like, "chry cho do this one" and "number chwo,” interchanging the “t” and “ch” sounds, because for her, the phonemes do not change the meaning of a word.
Now the fun stuff comes in—it’s your turn to apply these obscure terms to imitating accents. All you have to do is understand the minimal pairs in other languages and import those distinctions into English pronunciation. Well, maybe that’s not all, but at least knowing about minimal pairs is a good start to navigating the wide world of imitation.

The mountains surrounding Foxglove were perpetually cloudless in summer, hence the unsettled feeling that descended when we awoke to an overcast day. The forest grove out the kitchen window seemed hazy and the creek’s gurgle—faintly audible from inside—had intensified, as if the water flowed more furiously. My brother Collin and I sipped black coffee while he mixed cheese and vegetables into omelet mix: breakfast for Aunt Taylor, who had arrived late last night for her annual summer stay at Foxglove.
 
When Taylor finally made it to breakfast, the omelets had grown cold, Dad—who had taken the morning off work to see her—had grown grumpy, and Royella had grown annoyingly chirpy. Taylor’s white spaniel, Button, followed us as we moved outside into the strangely chilled morning air. Wrapping our shoulders in blankets, we settled into mismatched porch furniture. 
 
We picked at the omelets, devoured Royella’s homemade scones, and looked out at the ancient cedars and sugar pines, some with trunks over eight feet in diameter. My eyes rested on the sluggishly fanning wings of a swallowtail, perched on the fir beside a napping Button.
 
“So how was your drive up here?” Collin asked Taylor.
 
“Fine,” she said. “Took me almost three hours.”
 
“Really?” Royella said. “I’ve done it in one.”
 
“When were you at Table Mountain?” Dad asked Royella, chuckling. “No offense, honey, I just can’t picture it.”
 
“Me neither,” I said. I too found it hard to believe that Royella, the pastor’s pious widow, had visited Table Mountain, the Indian casino. Taylor usually stopped there for a night on the way to Foxglove.
 
“I didn’t gamble,” Royella snapped. “We did charity work.” 
Taylor abruptly put down her fork, clinking it against the chipped china. “Sorry to change the subject. But—”
 
“No, please do,” Collin said. Royella slurped her coffee.
 
“Anyway,” Taylor said, addressing dad, “I wanna talk with you after breakfast.”
 
“Sure thing,” he said. “What’s on your mind?”
 
“Well,” she said, “I just wanted to talk about the will and the property and stuff.” 
 
“Not this again,” he grunted as he ripped off a piece of scone.
 
They began to argue but were interrupted by Button. He let out a frenzied bark and began to yap incessantly. Standing on his hind legs, he clawed at the trunk of an old-growth oak that stood in the yard.
 
We quieted, listening as a buzzing noise reverberated within the tree, punctuated by Button’s high-pitched barks. Suddenly, Royella jumped to her feet.
 
 “Button, no!” she yelped, running down the porch stairs to the dog. Taylor and Dad sprung up and followed. Royella scooped up the dog. “Stay back,” she commanded the others. “Let’s go inside.”
 
After safely locking Button in the house, Royella explained that the strange buzzing sound had come from a diamondback rattler. The snake must have crawled into a deep hole within the oak’s expansive trunk.
  
Taylor gasped when Dad clinically observed that the snake could have injected “up to 800 milligrams of hemotoxic venom” into Button’s soft flesh. Collin rolled his eyes at me, signaling contempt for Dad’s never-ending attempt to impress Royella with his knowledge of mountain life 
 
 
*
 
Later, I washed dishes and Collin dried them, wiping away the suds I had missed. We listened to the muffled sounds of Dad and Royella arguing in the next room. “Just talk to her,” I heard Royella exclaim. “She’s your sister, just talk it out.”
 
I knew that dad wouldn’t agree to talk. He had told me that his parents had been clear: their meager fortune would go to Taylor,  and the Foxglove property, with its costly taxes and upkeep, would go to Dad. Yet the wording of the will, when they finally opened it, was ambiguous. Now it seemed Taylor also felt entitled to a share of Foxglove.
 
Deciding that an awkward conversation was better than letting family tension ruin our Foxglove summer, I left the dishes to Collin and walked up the stairs, mentally rehearsing a speech that urged Taylor to keep the peace with Dad. I shivered in my t-shirt and shorts, inadequate for the day’s uncharacteristic chill.
 
I opened the creaky door to her room. “Taylor,” I called, entering and finding it empty. The dresser that my great-grandfather had once carved stood in the corner of the room, covered in makeup containers, toiletries, and a coaster-less glass of water.  Not wanting its condensation to ruin the wooden surface, I picked up the glass, noticing an open, single-sheet letter beside it.
 
The letter, headed by a Macksfield Insurance logo, offered a quote for the value of the Foxglove house in the case of a fire. In the margin below the text was a neat, hand-written note: “Royella and Taylor, I’m still working on calculations for the value of the trees as requested. Will get back to you shortly. –Jeb.”

“If you can approach a Shakespeare work and come away with an understanding of it—of both the fundamental truths of human existence it presents and its brilliantly deliberate language—then you can approach and access anything within the humanities,” director Matthew B. Barrieau ’16 explains. “That’s why this Harvard tradition of presenting individual scenes is so important. It makes Shakespeare more accessible to first-time actors and viewers.”
Barrieau is one of several Harvard undergraduates directing the Hyperion Scene Recitals, running March 7 to 8 in the Adams Pool Theater. This year, to honor the 450th anniversary of the birth of Shakespeare, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company has selected scenes from the Bard’s greatest hits, the production’s theme.  In 90 minutes, favorite monologues and familiar scenes will be presented by a slew of actors, both veteran and novice.
With auditions held one week after Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Company’s Common Casting and an unconventional array of actors, the Hyperion Scene Recitals’s cast is united by one thread—a common love of Shakespeare.  “What I love about the Hyperion Scene Recitals is that it  allows the actor to explore a variety of pieces from the canon in a relaxed but rigorous environment, all with an extremely supportive and fun group of people. Need I say more?" actress Mallika A. Snyder ’17 says.
 
Barrieau will direct the famous handkerchief scene from “Othello," Act III, Scene III and the climax of “King Lear,” Act III, Scene II. “The difficulties of each of the scenes are really distinct because with ‘Othello,’ it is a challenge of finding ways to cut the scene while leaving behind a discrete unit that is inherently meaningful,” Barrieau says. “With ‘King Lear,’ however, the scene is quite emotionally charged, but we don’t have the entire play to build up to Lear going mad with grief.”
In order to draw out greater emotion from Julius B. Ross ’17, who plays King Lear, one rehearsal took place on the banks of the Charles River during heavy snowfall to evoke the starkness and uninhibited desperation of the scene, according to Barrieau.
What makes this contemporary production of Shakespeare interesting is not superficial elements like setting or costume. It is the fervor of Harvard undergraduates injecting new lifeblood into the canon, reinvigorating oft-heard scripts lines with their personal understanding of the wordplay and universality of a work. “The recital is worth seeing because it’s only produced because the actors love the material and have dedicated themselves to it,” Ross says.

Nearly two decades after his directorial debut, Harmony Korine is still creating films that portray untamed youth using mixed-medium dreamlike sequences and haunting, glossy visuals. A film poet and a “warrior of cinema,” Korine remains true to his independent art film roots despite challenging Hollywood’s genre confines with his latest film, “Spring Breakers.” Korine sat down with The Crimson in between screenings of his films at the Harvard Film Archive.
 
The Harvard Crimson: “Trash Humpers” feels and looks a lot like a found media object or a viral video. Do you think people are craving a certain kind of reality, or just an image of it? 
 
Harmony Korine: I’m not sure what people crave. Yeah, the film was conceived as a tape that had been thrown away in the trash somewhere or buried in a ditch or something…something that maybe had been locked in some Ziploc bag or something and stored up in the guts of some horse.
 
THC: In past interviews you’ve called yourself a “mistakist.” Would you say you used a similar framework for “Spring Breakers?”
 
HK: I used to say it was a mistakist art form, that I was making films according to a mistakist manifesto. This idea that the errors were somehow the most exciting thing—they were the entry point. I was interested in the randomness of it all; it was like putting different chemicals in a jar and shaking it up and documenting the explosion. I guess since I’ve been making films for a while now I feel like I’m kind of tapping into something…starting to evolve. I’m starting to figure it out.
 
THC: Personally you’re starting to evolve?
 
HK: No, not as a person. I never really evolve as a person. It’s just the films.
 
THC: “Spring Breakers” is very different than your other works, which are more anti-commercial. Do you feel like these are the kinds of films you’re going to make moving forward? Anti-Hollywood blockbusters?
 
HK: The movie is still very much representative of what I do, and it’s exciting for me, though, to be able to make films that can reach a larger audience. I don’t shy away from that. I’ve always wanted to put out the most radical work in a mainstream way. I’ve always wanted my films—all of them—to have that type of effect, but it doesn’t always work out that way. You never go in wanting to limit the work.
 
THC: This film is almost more textural, aesthetically, than any of your other films. Did you always want to play with those kinds of visual effects?
 
HK: I wanted the movie in some ways to have a lulling or trance-like or drug effect. I wanted it to be a sensory attack, something that was more immersive. Almost loop-based and electronic.
 
THC: Were you hoping for the momentum behind the “breakout” stars who had things to prove like Selena Gomez?
 
HK: I liked the whole idea of it. First and foremost you have to believe them as characters separate from who they are in real life. It has to work in that way. I also liked the idea of them also being in real life tied to that pop mythology and being connected to the current landscape.
THC: Earlier on in the film before the spring break trip starts, the girls get together and smoke weed and get hypersexual. Is that how you envision women behaving when they want to get high when men aren’t there, or is that what you think people want to see?
HK: I really don’t know. I don’t know why I do anything I do. I could make something up but I have no idea.
THC: How did you work with Franco on his character, Alien?
 
HK: Alien was an amalgamation of a lot of kids I had gone to school with and that I would ride the bus with. He’s a real Southern archetype. Probably for about a year prior to the film I would talk to him about it and send him audio clips, visuals, photographs. Anything that I thought pertained visually, spiritually…anything that was a sound, the way someone spoke, a kind of tenor…that’s how we developed him.
THC: Is Gucci Mane's character, Archie, really short for 'Arch Nemesis?'
HK: Wow, I never thought of that. It could be.
 
THC: Did Gucci have any crazy antics on set?
 
HK: Gucc, Geez. He gets stoned a lot. He works really hard and he works until he passes out. He was recording during off hours. He was asleep for the whole sex scene. He just passed out for that whole thing.
 
THC: How did you film the party scenes? There were obviously real things going on.
 
HK: We set it up. There are tons of kids there and we just encouraged them to do that and we would film it.
 
THC: Would you rent hotel rooms and invite them?
 
HK: Yeah, mostly fucked-up motels, and obviously we knew we were going to destroy them—that was it. We would encourage that.
 
THC: Did you have serious damage bills?
 
HK: We went into it and went shooting in places that were already messed up to begin with. We weren’t shooting in nice hotel chains. These were bombed out.
THC: How was it to include your wife in the film?
HK: Natural. It was awesome.
THC: She’s the only one—out of the main girls—who gets naked!
HK: Wow, yeah that’s true. I’m going to tell you something I haven’t told anybody yet. Chris Cunningham and I made a film together like eight years ago that we never told anybody about. It’s called “Mitch Poppins.” It still needs to be edited but it will be finished this year.
THC: That’s exciting. Any clue as to what it’s about?
THK: That’s all I will say. It was something we shot like eight years ago and we shelved it for a while because it was too next-level.
THC: So now that you’ve reached a new level with “Spring Breakers” you can go there?
HK: Yeah. It’s totally different. It’s its own thing.
 
THC: Has “Spring Breakers” changed you as a filmmaker? Do you plan on returning to your previous techniques and aesthetic?
 
HK: Every movie kind of changes you. But yeah, probably. I probably won’t go back in the way that you’re thinking. I’ll only go forward. I’ll keep going and make some next-level shit.
 
THC: What’s some next-level shit?
 
HK: The thing I’m working on now.
 
THC: Want to talk to me about it?
 
HK: I can’t give you specifics but I’ll tell you that it will be super next level. It’s ultra ultra. It’s full-on; I’m going for it. Now, I’m just going for it.
 
THC: Do you feel like filmmakers need film school or college?
 
HK: Of course not. You need a criminal mind.
 
THC: What does a criminal mind mean for you?
 
HK: A mentality. A trap mentality. You need to figure out how to get what you need to get, do what you need to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 


Cassandra E. Euphrat Weston ’14 is alternately ecstatic and remarkably calm as she sits in Café Gato Rojo and recounts the origins of Speak Out Loud, the Harvard slam poetry collective she co-founded as a freshman three years ago. “It was the first year with a formal Wintersession—the first year of ‘You come back to campus, we’ll give you money to start student programs,’” she says, theatrically mimicking the gruff tones of an imagined uptight Harvardian On High. 
Much of the initial impetus in creating SOL was to offer an alternative to the more intense entry processes of other Harvard arts groups. “So many of the activities and creative outlets were based on competition—I mean, comp sounds like competition right?” Euphrat Weston says. “We wanted to make Speak Out Loud a community where, above all, there were no entry requirements.” 
As the group grew, however, the non-hierarchical and relaxed environment of SOL was countered by a desire to slam with other collectives. But both Euphrat Weston and the rest of SOL’s members are acutely aware of the potentially contradictory nature of attempting to create personal and nuanced work while also aiming to please a diverse audience. “Everyone who does slam knows that it’s broken—that it’s a game and it’s imperfect,” Euphrat Weston admits. SOL’s diverse ways of rationalizing the tension between the confessional and the competitive reflects how the spoken word community at large continues to grapple with the paradoxical nature of the slam format. Reconciling the competitive aspects of slam poetry with the artistic aspirations of spoken word poetry  is difficult, but according to the poets of SOL, not impossible.
 


WHY SLAM? 
Euphrat Weston is careful to underline the distinction between spoken word poetry, an art form based on the presentation of honest, candid, and often technically experimental work, and slam poetry, a scored face-off between a group of spoken word poets. SOL certainly didn’t gravitate towards slam in the hopes of boosting turnout. In fact, despite never having led a spoken word workshop before starting SOL, Euphrat Weston says the first workshop she planned with co-founder Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 “went better than we could have imagined.” 
Slam, however, brings with it other irresistible perks. Euphrat Weston sees the draw towards spoken word competition primarily as an impetus for spoken word poets to produce higher quality poetry. “People want to have something really polished,” she says. Moreover, slam offered the best avenue to formally enter the national and local spoken word communities. These tempting impetuses caused the group to begin to transition away from the inherently introspective activity of creating art and towards the confusing and provocative world of trial-by-audience. 
After a momentary pause, Euphrat Weston shrugs and quickly offers another reason for becoming involved in slam: so SOL can go to CUPSI. CUPSI, or the College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational, is a renowned yearly national college slam competition. This year, Speak Out Loud is sending five of its poets, including Euphrat Weston, to represent Harvard in Boulder, Colo. When the poets go to CUPSI, each will bring along distinct and developed opinions about how to resolve the inherent conflict in creating art for the purpose of competition.
 
COMPETITION FOSTERING COMMUNITY 
 George V. Watsky, almost a year removed from his second studio album, “Cardboard Castles,” which shot up to number one on the iTunes hip-hop/rap charts last March, took a break from his marathonic recording sessions for his follow-up record to talk via phone about the role of audience and community in his journey to artistic recognition. Watsky, a San Francisco native who was involved with CUPSI and the spoken word organization Youth Speaks, first received attention for the slam poetry he presented to much success in national slams and on YouTube. Watsky quickly rattles off an impressively informed history of spoken word that suggests the art is predicated on the existence of slam as a means of networking and visibility. “It’s hard to separate spoken word from slam poetry because the whole spoken word community blossomed around slam competitions,” he says.
 Watsky, who believes that the popularity of slam was integral to his own transformation from spoken word artist to best-selling rapper, cites the influence of spoken word on “Def Poetry Jam.” The HBO series, hosted by hip-hop magnate Russell Simmons, brought the art form to a large group of young people during its run from 2002 to 2007. Watsky believes that main point of the competitive aspect of slam is to increase awareness about slam and thereby inspire further artistic innovation. “I’m not really a rule stickler. I don’t care enough about the competition to be worried about honing the rules of slam,” Watsky says. “Slam is great because it allows people to find out about the art form.”
Watsky’s exposure to both the cultures of slam competitions and rap battles has also reinforced his belief that the slam community is designed for mutual support far more than bitter rivalries. “You use poetic devices in rap battles, but it’s a totally different vibe…. You are directly opposing someone else, and your goal is to tear them down,” he says. “In spoken word, your piece is not about how everybody else is whack and sucks…. A poetry slam is like finger snaps and hippie love. The stereotypes start with a grain of truth.” The very reputation of slam, in Watsky’s mind, evokes Woodstock-like images of communal bliss––if slam poetry were to veer too heavily into strategy and machination, it would lose its identity.
 


CONFINES OF CUPSI 
“I think all slam poets kind of hate slam poetry,” SOL board member Virginia R. Marshall ‘15, an active Crimson Arts editor, says ponderously. Although minor variations to the slam form crop up from competition to competition, the basic system is the same for almost all events, including CUPSI: three to five random judges, who don’t necessarily know anything about spoken word, are picked out of the audience to judge the event, which has a set number of pre-determined poets. The judges, who may given a somewhat nebulous rubric (five points for content, five points for presentation, for example), grade each artist’s up to three-minute performance on a 10-point scale. A number of rounds follow, after which the highest and lowest scores for each poet are usually dropped. At the end of the night, those who have the highest average scores win the event.
Marshall’s issues with the system concern how much the psychology of the audience impacts the program. “In the psychology of a slam, what’s most interesting is that it actually does matter what order you go in,” Marshall says. “Warming up an audience is extremely essential.” 
To help with the process, many slams employ so-called “sacrificial poets,” who go first and act as calibrators of judge’s tastes and scoring proclivities. In addition to giving official competitors a chance to know the judges and adjust their impending programs accordingly, the “sacrificial poets” system helps to combat the phenomenon of “score creep”: the tendency of judges to grade poets more liberally as they event progresses. But Marshall is quick to stress that the system is flawed. “Sacrificial poets are meant to bring the scores up by the time you get to the first competitor, but it never really works…. Inevitably, people get warmed up to the experience of hearing poetry and will grade successive poets higher,” Marshall says. 
  Marshall says that she takes solace in the fact that Speak Out Loud has the humor and self-awareness to turn the judge-pleaser tropes inside out and create “meta” explorations of poetic stereotypes and pandering. “We really try to challenge the perceptions about what a spoken word poem is supposed to be,” Marshall says, smiling with a hint of mischief. “There’s a lot of manipulation of emotion that goes on in slam poetry.” 
In addition to the “shock poem”archetype, Marshall outlined other slam poem archetypes that SOL attempts to subvert, including the funny referential poem, which she says often includes repeated allusions to late-1990s Nickelodeon cartoons. If Marshall, who emanates optimism, has an archetype, she says it’s the “happy poem,” which was harder to sell to audiences early on in her tumultuous slam journey. “I accidentally signed up for a slam not knowing what it was…. My first slam was a terrifying experience where I got incredibly low scores and lost. I was shocked but also a little bit exhilarated,” she says. 
 Marshall’s willingness to stick with the construct has led her from traumatized early dabblings to a place on Harvard’s CUPSI team. One of new poems is “( ),” a group piece that plays extensively with form and function, and suggests that slam archetypes are meant to be broken. By being conscious of the limitations of sensationalism and actively working to avoid slam poetry clichés, Marshall has managed to channel her distaste for the competitive aspects of slam into artistic innovation.
 
SLAM AS SPORT
 Where Marshall deals with scoring by reveling in SOL’s propensity for irreverence and self-commentary, Bex H. Kwan ’14 embraces the raw competition of slam. “I’m the kind of person who makes little competitions for myself when I’m bored,” Kwan said. “I used to play competitive sports a lot.”
Kwan is aware of the what many perceive as an ideological conflict between art and sport but believes that slam is the closest thing to  a combination between the two disciplines. Kwan, who speaks with a magnetic cerebrality and poeticism, suddenly quotes Robert Frost: “‘Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down.’” 
Kwan’s borrowed simile suggests that the creation of poetry tailored towards competition still allows poets a considerable amount of freedom. Kwan confesses to feeling a modicum of frustration about the intricate rules of slam poetry but also believes, similarly to Euphrat Weston, that the nitpicky nature of competition pushes the art to the next level. “If I could change the form easily, then it wouldn’t challenge me as much,” Kwan said.
 What Kwan is wary of is how slam can be reduced to its more mechanical elements, offering a cautionary example about the roboticism that occasionally creeps into competitive dance routines. “It’s all ‘How many high-kicks can you do? How many pirouettes can you do?’ Sometimes these art forms that we love so much can feel like just the tricks and the flashy parts,” Kwan says. Kwan rejects the rationales of those who feel like they need to give in to an oppressive system to get a good score and shares Marshall’s view that one of SOL’s goals is to transcend slam’s more conformist elements, but also believes that the competitive nature of slam fosters artistry by dramatizing questions already present in poets’ minds.
“What’s the context? What has the audience seen before? What will come after? These are questions that already exist, but slam brings them to the forefront of the poet’s mind, and that’s just fun.” For Kwan, the battle is the essence of the art.
 
THE SHOWCASE AND THE TRUTH
Each poet’s booming voice reverberates off the wooden walls of Holden Chapel and into the ears of enthusiastic audience members. The five CUPSI poets, along with guests from other Boston schools, are hosting a send-off spoken word event before their departure for Boulder. Despite the fact that the showcase is primarily for friends of SOL and doesn’t have an official winner, yellow scorecards and comment sheets still grace the insides of the programs—any pre-CUPSI criticism can help. 
Due in part to the highly personal nature of much of slam poetry, SOL has a well-defined privacy policy about printing the specifics of individual poems, but the issues the CUPSI team discussed ranged from gentrification to immigration, from parental expectation to the pressure on poets to discuss social justice. A running soundtrack of gasps of approval, extensive snaps, and supportive shouts comes both from their teammates and the rest of the crowd. The positivity of the audience was astounding. When poets stumbled, they received more applause. When they revealed deeply personal truths or just offered a light quip, they were met with the same enthusiasm and joyful noise. 
Jalem D. Towler ’15 and Henri C. Garrison-Desany ’16, still noticeably amped up from their performances, discussed the importance of presenting emotionally honest sketches of their lives through their poetry. For Towler, who is involved with youth tutoring in Roxbury, the first priority is transmitting his passions. “I like to tell stories with my work,” he says. “The kids that I work with in Roxbury, God and my faith, and personal experiences are all central.” Towler’s desire to get at the truth of his experience has caused him to minimize his initial interest in the competitive aspects of slam. “When I first came into poetry slam, I was definitely focused on competition, catering to my audience, scoring well, and having my art be appreciated,” he says. “At the end of the day, that’s no longer my purpose for getting on the mic.” 
 Garrison-Desany, a Human Evolutionary Biology concentrator, often injects scientific concepts and logic into his ruminations on love, loss, and the confusion of college life. Like Towler, he believes the authenticity of his work is more important than any external judgment. “Some poets do put a lot of weight on scores, and by that sometimes the art has suffered,” he says. “I’ve seen teams that are very closed off from other teams and in their own competitive bubble.” 
Garrison-Desany says he thinks this entirely defeats the collaborative purpose of the form and is grateful SOL doesn’t fall into a similar mindset. “We keep our poems honest and real, and that is the growing sentiment within the slam community, ” he says. Garrison-Desany suggests that SOL’s closeness and passion for their art allows them to hold each other accountable for creating truthful, expressive poems rather than ones that conform to slam norms.
 
REMAINING POSITIVE 
The judgment inherent in slam poetry carries with it pressure to create overly familiar work that is likely to please audiences, as well as the potential for inter-team animosity and a more general critical atmosphere. The members of Speak Out Loud, however, have managed through their philosophical framings of slam, managed to transcend the petty pitfalls of standoffish slamming. Euphrat Weston’s desire for polish, Marshall’s for subversion, Kwan’s for sport, Towler and Garrison-Desany’s for truth, and, Watsky’s suggestion of the importance of  community and respect, all combine to create a welcoming and warm community and space for artistic expression. If Speak Out Loud and history are any indication, the spoken word world has managed largely to stave off the competitiveness and hostility that can come with the tournament format, instead managing to preserve the spirit of warmth and inclusiveness for which it is known.

American. For many, the mention of the word brings patriotic images of bald eagles and red, white, and blue to the mind. But, to me, it stands as a synonym for white culture. As the child of immigrant parents and an immigrant myself, I’ve never been able to genuinely call myself an American. And can you blame me? Despite the movement towards a more diverse and integrated society, America still isn’t the melting pot it claims to be. Instead, it’s a compartmentalized storage unit, with Whites in the biggest compartment. During the Super Bowl, Coca-Cola aired a commercial in which “America the Beautiful” was sung in several different languages to reflect the diversity of this nation. The commercial, however, was met with enormous criticism in conservative circles for not being “American” or patriotic enough. This sort of response is a paradigm of how selective American culture tends to be.
American culture seems inclusive of only a westernized way of life. This is reasonable given the fact that, for centuries, the majority of Americans were of European descent. However, with the United States shifting rapidly toward a majority-minority make up, that restrictive conceptualization of American culture is now more subject to change. Yet, despite a greater movement toward integration, I still feel like an outcast in a culture that I have a hard time calling my own.
One of the biggest issues is that, culturally-speaking, we as a nation have difficulty thinking of anybody who doesn’t have white skin and whose first language isn’t English as “just American”. Even when we acknowledge that non-whites are American, we sub-characterize them as something along the lines of “African-American” or “Asian-American.” But an American is anyone who calls this country home, regardless of ethnicity. American is not an ethnicity, but a nationality, and so it shouldn’t be coupled with ethnicity or race. When Nina Divaluri won the Miss America pageant last year, she received an onslaught of criticism for not being American “enough” or American at all, simply because she didn’t look quite like the beauty queens who’d come before her. Yet she was born and raised in America. One’s cultural background does not determine one’s devotion to this country.
We’re also mistaken in thinking that only citizens of the United States are Americans. The term defines a much wider region than we tend to recognize: It’s representative of both North and South Americans, which is why it’s ironic that Latin American immigrants receive some of the heaviest criticism for not being true “Americans.” The truth is that most of our patriotism is rooted in ignorance: the idea that we are the only country that fosters ideals of freedom and equality. Not only is this simply untrue; it also misses the fact that our nation is flawed. This mentality leads to the belittlement of other nationalities and non-white ethnicities within our country. But American culture is itself a fabrication. It’s influenced by so many other cultures that it itself is undefined. Since we can’t specify exactly what American culture is, we don’t have the right to determine what is un-American.
I myself am not blameless in this identity crisis, either. Though I believe that American culture should be far more inclusive, the traditional, white, English-speaking definition of “American” is so ingrained in my mind that I implicitly recognize a dichotomy between that which is American and that which is the other, subconsciously considering myself the other. I don’t have ancestors who came over on the Mayflower, my parents still have difficulties with English grammar, and my name is apparently very difficult to pronounce (it’s Tass-neem). Thus, when people ask me where I am from, I impulsively say Bangladesh, only to be confused for an international student.  And if I try to adopt aspects of “American” culture, I’m told that I’m becoming “white-washed” by other immigrants or first generation peers. The word “assimilation” is profane. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, because it implies that I am forced to transform myself to accommodate others; it’s degrading. In the end, I’m just left confused, trying to figure out where I fit between these polarities. I was raised in a different environment than my parents, and I was raised with different teachings than my peers.
I have given up the expectation that others will be satisfied with how I identify myself, or that I’ll even be satisfied with how I identify myself. It’s an issue that is almost impossible to resolve until we as a society realize that there isn’t one model or ideal American home life, culture, or physical attribute. “American” is a broad, elusive term, one that’s too often applied to a narrow way of life. We need to stop being so exclusive—otherwise, soon, not even America will be American enough.

A few weeks ago, I signed up for Twitter. I didn’t really know how it worked, or why anyone would enjoy having one, but all the writers I admire use it, and it’s said to be a useful tool of self-promotion. So with the careful selection of a selfie, an artsy background picture, and a somewhat self-indulgent description of myself (“Writer, contrarian, humanist.”), I was in business.
I quickly signed up to follow the magazines that align with my politics: the New Republic, the American Prospect, Slate, etc. I also added a few highbrow publications that I don’t read, but that abetted my intellectual, leftist online persona. (Think the London Review of Books and the Times Literary Supplement.)
Soon enough, I was fielding a torrent of tweets from the liberal punditry reaffirming my pre-existing worldview. I would then disseminate these tidbits out to a modest but growing band of equally liberal followers. “Colorado and Washington are right: It is immoral to cage humans for smoking marijuana,” read one of my re-tweets, originally from the Atlantic.


“A socialist snowplow just went past my house. Will this tyranny never end?” read another—that tweet itself re-disseminated by the left-leaning Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne ’73.
Soon, it became clear that Twitter was a convenient, addictive, and totally inadequate way to consume all my news and dish out my opinions. To avoid drinking in and spitting forth the same Kool-Aid every evening, I started following a few publications and pundits that I loathe, from National Review to Commentary. But I soon found that while I could tolerate and feed off the energy of reductionist, 140-character invectives with which I agreed, when a National Review tweeter made a partisan claim, it seemed like wrongness concentrated. 
If I were to re-tweet any statements from the right, my tone would be critical, even sarcastic. For the most part, however, I just engaged with the simplified content on the left, and let the other junk slide by into cyber-oblivion. Despite the torrent of information available, I was moving further and further into a political corner.
So far I’ve discussed my own misuse of social media, but this is far from just a personal account. Rather, partisan retrenchment via Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms is a general problem that afflicts Generation Y, especially those of us who are politically engaged. 
Let’s briefly abandon anecdote and look at the science behind this claim. Two years ago, a team of researchers at the University of Indiana analyzed a random sample of 250,000 politically themed tweets from 45,000 users. They then created an algorithm to determine the political leanings of each relevant user and examined the partisan affiliation of the content that each user re-tweeted. The results? Ninety-three percent of the content retweeted by right-leaners was conservative in nature, and 80 percent of the content retweeted by left-leaners was liberal. Far from broadening users’ political views, social media—at least in the case of Twitter—is creating echo chambers for increasingly cloistered partisan communities.
Interestingly, in his 2006 book Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce, the famous legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein ’78 predicted this phenomenon, warning of the formation of online information “cocoons.” In the book, he referenced the work of MIT professor Nicholas Negroponte, who “prophecied the emergence of ‘the Daily Me,’ an entirely personalized newspaper in which each of us could select…perspectives that we liked.” 
This prophecy would, of course, materialize with the popularization of Twitter. “The central problem involves…communications universes in which we hear only what we choose and only what comforts us,” added Sunstein.
Facebook, one could argue, is increasingly used in a Twitter-esque fashion when it comes to political matters. And with publications themselves active on all social media platforms, a natural emphasis has been put on partisan provocativeness in titles, subheadings, and, of course, the tweets and Facebook posts that advertise this content. In other words, news sources themselves have become involved in the construction of these partisan, cloistered “Daily Me’s” which Sunstein warned about.
This isn’t to say that social media is about to bring down democracy. On the contrary, these new platforms allow information to saturate the public more quickly than ever before, and our knowledge of the most relevant or recent news is no longer predicated on visiting the correct website. But in an era of conspicuous partisanship, we had best be wary of taking this deluge of information, and—instead of broadening our perspective—warping it into a cocoon of ignorance.

The Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement to cap the number of students in any Harvard College section or lab group at 12, started with about that many members. In recent weeks, however, a number of members of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences as well as the University Philosophy Department have endorsed the effort.
We understand the pedagogical pitfalls presented by sprawling sections, and we appreciate the Harvard Teaching Campaign’s work to bring the problem to the forefront of discourse on campus. We believe FAS should approach section size on a department-by-department basis, focusing not on limiting section size to a fixed number but rather on making sure discussion-based sections remain discussion-based and participatory. Especially given the logistical and monetary costs that would come with section reduction, FAS should move toward smaller sections only where necessary.
At the heart of the Teaching Campaign is a petition urging Harvard to “fulfill its promises of excellence” by reducing section size. We, too, hope that Harvard will take advantage of its rich resources to provide students with an exemplary education. And yet in some disciplines, we believe that excellence can exist even in a section containing over a dozen students. A statistics teaching fellow, for example, can expound equations to 18 or 20 pupils with ease.
In other areas of study, however, we do note the need for section downsizing. It comes as no surprise that the primary backers of the Teaching Campaign work in the Philosophy Department and that History Department affiliates contributed most of the quotes featured on the campaign’s website. Certain departments, especially those in the humanities, use section as a mode of facilitating discussion among students. Such discussion misses the mark when not everyone can fit around the table or when time runs too short for each student to make his or her voice heard.
The Teaching Campaign highlights an issue Harvard cannot afford to ignore. But instead of imposing a rigid section-size limit on the whole College, FAS should look to those who know best: the departments themselves. Only those who have experience teaching certain courses can understand best practices and ascertain how many students should sit in those sections. If FAS works with professors to figure out what sections could use shrinking and just how much of it they need, Harvard can find a solution both flexible and effective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
For us Gen Y-ers, children of America’s “unipolar moment,” it is nearly impossible to relate to the Cold War zeitgeist of desk drills, space races, and Daisy Girls. Except for some brief, frenzied moments in 2001-2, the jihadists lurking between the cracks of 21st century state authority have never seemed to threaten our collective existence; from where we stand today, the threat of Chinese ascendancy is distant and mostly economic.
 
On the news of a Russian takeover of Crimea in the wake of a pro-Western revolution in Kiev, American commentators have been abuzz with speculation that thanks to Vladimir Putin’s megalomania and Russia’s timeless complexes, the Cold War never genuinely ended. To be sure, the current crisis in Ukraine represents a definite nadir in U.S.-Russia relations—a nightmare scenario that Western policymakers, convinced that Russia could be domesticated into a peaceful Euro-Atlantic order, more or less assumed would never come.
 
Though ensuring Ukraine remains free from Russia’s orbit is by no means a vital American interest, Moscow’s violation of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty ought not to be taken lightly. Our NATO allies to Ukraine’s north (skipping, of course, over Kremlin-bound Belarus) and west have fair reason to be concerned: standard-fare Russian bullying is to be expected from a regional power, but territorial revisionism at the expense of sovereign states is a clear repudiation of international consensus.
 
For the sake of Ukraine’s integrity, Western powers should work doubly hard to weigh against Russian aggression with financial guarantees and veiled threats—though nobody can pretend Washington has as much skin in the Ukrainian game as Moscow, narrowing the gap will do much to shore up trust in the global order.
 
All things considered, however, we must drop the pretense that a new Cold War is brewing in Maidan Square and Simferopol. True, it seems at this point that the Obama administration’s reset policy, which I treated optimistically in my article at the Harvard Political Review in 2010, has no legs: few great powers have successfully opted for strategic partnership over competition. But the lesson to take away from Kiev is not that Russia will be Russia, or that the fall of the wall has been undone. Rather, it is a reminder that no matter how pure the intentions of liberal internationalists, great powers will be great powers.
 
Regardless of whatever in particular emerges from the standoff in Ukraine, the United States and NATO must rewrite their Russia policies around the expectation that Moscow, like Washington, will seek to dominate its near abroad regardless of how much diplomatic pressure is brought to bear from afar. No need to divine any Tsarist or Soviet legacy in Crimea, Ossetia, or Transnistria—consider for a second: how many times has the United States, ostensibly guided by a liberal vision of the world, invaded and occupied lesser states in its own backyard?
 
We should stop short, however, of concluding that Russia acting like the Eurasian power that it is is entirely bad. While the struggle over Ukraine does indeed pit Western interests against Russian interests however one slices it, America should recognize that Russian realpolitik, when its strategic goals intersect with ours, is a force to be harnessed, rather than repelled altogether.
 
For one, despite the precious political capital wasted by neoconservative elements in the American foreign policy establishment on turning the Syrian civil war into a geopolitical proving ground, there is plenty to be gained vis-à-vis Syria by allowing Russia its stake in the East Mediterranean. Among the doomsday scenarios foreseeable on Syria’s horizon—a jihadist takeover, a violent redrawing of century-old borders, the roiling status quo—seeking Russia’s cooperation by respecting its naval interests in Tartus and Latakia hardly registers as menacing.
 
Moreover, it is worth noting that Russia’s fear of a rebel takeover in Damascus has to do just as much, if not more, with concerns about regional jihadist spillover, which could ignite the autonomous republics of the North Caucasus and threaten Moscow with yet another wave of Islamic-tinged Chechen terrorism. In Russia’s support for “the devil you know” in Damascus, America—however it calculates its interests in the Syrian struggle—ought to recognize a power motivated by familiar concerns about radical insurgency and global terror, and find within it a basis for collaboration.
 
Moreover, for Americans concerned about a maximalist Chinese rise, full of designs on both the Eurasian heartland and the Pacific Rim, there is good reason to be optimistic about Russia’s ambitions to dominate its historical near abroad. In a remarkable geopolitical twist, Russia’s fear of Chinese domination of Central Asia has transformed the northern giant’s presence in the former Soviet “stans” into a strategic complement, rather than a direct challenge, to America’s overstretched military presence. As China dawns as the only possible Cold War-style rival on America’s horizons, Moscow can become, in pursuing its own narrowly construed self-interest, an unintentional contractor for Washington in the Asian interior.
 
Let us hope that the crisis in Ukraine is resolved peacefully—not only for the sake of Ukrainian national aspirations and the post-Cold War territorial order, but perhaps most importantly, for the sake of a rational adjustment of America’s approach toward 21st century Russia. For what it’s worth, recent events in Crimea have finally laid to rest the notion that Russian regional ambitions can be neutralized by diplomatic inducement. It is now up to us not to avoid falling for the opposite canard: that Russia remains implacably captive to a Cold War mentality of world domination. The truth lies somewhere in the middle; an overburdened America should do whatever it can to harness Russia’s self-interest where it intersects with our own.

Launched last Friday, the Kuumba Singer’s multimedia campaign “I, Too, Am Harvard” has drawn hundreds of thousands of internet views from around the world in an effort to open a dialogue about racial inclusion at Harvard.
The project, which will be performed on-stage as the opening production of Kuumba’s sixteenth-annual Black Arts Festival, began last spring in the wake of discussions about affirmative action and evolved into an online collection of testimonies from black students about their varying experiences being a minority on campus.
“We’re starting to have a cross-cultural dialogue between different races, where black people are coming out and speaking about our campaign, for things we weren't able to talk about before,” said Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, Kuumba’s recording secretary.
Last semester, Matsuda-Lawrence enrolled in an independent study course in order to conduct interviews with black students about identity, microaggression, and racism on Harvard’s campus. These interviews, about 40 in total, became the basis for the “I, Too, Am Harvard” play, which will be performed on Friday.
In addition to the original 40 interviews, Kuumba launched a multimedia campaign, which has been profiled by news outlets like BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. The project features more than 60 black students voicing their concerns about marginalization and stereotypes in their lives.
Responding to these concerns, members of the Harvard community expressed eagerness to listen to the messages of “I, Too, Am Harvard.”
“I think there is always room for more dialogue, and if some people in their class don't feel that this is their Harvard, then I think that is really regrettable,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “We need to open our ears and open our hearts and listen to what can contribute to our campus.”
 
Creators of “I, Too, Am Harvard” said they hope that the campaign provides a platform for ongoing discussions at the University.
 
Monica A. Ukah ’16, who was photographed for the campaign, said that “I, Too, Am Harvard” offered her an outlet to speak about her experience with racism and on campus.
 
“The campaign is a great venue to speak about things that aren’t normally spoken about here,” Ukah said. “Here, there isn’t much of a way to fight back.”
 
President of Kuumba Lauren E. Fields ’14 agreed that students do not spend enough time meaningfully reflecting on issues of diversity at Harvard.
“A lot of times when people talk about diversity on campus it seems to be just about the numbers...without actually engaging with that diversity actually means,” Fields said.
Kuumba members said that they hope the stories and concerns in “I, Too, Am Harvard” will outlive the performance on Friday, which sold out almost immediately after the box office opened Tuesday.
“We certainly will be continuing our discussions….We know this movement is too big to stop moving,” said Matthew S. Williams ’14, Vice President of Kuumba.
In addition to the multimedia campaign and the play, some Kuumba members hope to continue to hear feedback from the larger community and add that feedback into their conversations.
“We are hoping by the time the show is performed on Friday, and in the time following that we can get a clear idea of what people are saying on campus, how they feel, and how we can incorporate that into what we hope to bring on campus,” Kuumba member Abigail W.T.A. Mariam ’15 said.

A forum at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum discussed Russia’s occupation of Crimea, an autonomous republic of Ukraine, on Tuesday night.
 
"I'm going to make a prediction that this crisis is going to define President Obama's leadership for the next several years and his entire presidency in a similar way the missile crisis defined JFK's,” said Eugene B. Kogan, a Stanton Nuclear Security postdoctoral fellow at Stanford.
Kogan agreed with fellow panelists Serhii Plokhii, professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard, and Brigadier General Kevin Ryan, director of the Defense and Intelligence Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, that future policy regarding the current situation with Russia will impact the Obama administration’s foreign policy worldwide.
According to R. Nicholas Burns, international relations professor at the Kennedy School and the event’s moderator, the forum ”really let our students know about the complexity of the issue—the Russian invasion of Ukraine and what is at stake for Americans.”
 
The focus on America’s reaction to the crisis was perhaps a result of the panel’s expectation that Obama would follow through on a memorandum known as the “1994 Budapest Declaration,” under which the U.S. agreed to take measures to protect and respect Ukraine’s borders in exchange for Ukraine reducing its nuclear missile power. 
“There is no legal obligation for President Obama to send in the U.S. military… but I think there is a moral, political obligation,” Burns said of the Declaration.
Although the panelists unanimously agreed about the importance of U.S. involvement, they expressed pessimism over Obama’s limited choices of action. According to Ryan, a retired Army officer, “the military option is off the table” because of a lack of American troops trained for the specific type of operation necessary.
The panelists also discussed the possibility of economic sanctions as a means to put pressure on Putin’s government. They concluded that sanctions could harm the U.S. and would possibly do little to change Putin’s behavior.
In a statement to The Crimson, Burns stressed the essential issue at hand in the situation in Ukraine: “We thought the Cold War had ended…but yet here we are, with Europe being divided again, in a way, by president Putin, by his brutal invasion and attack on the Crimea.”
Attendees said they felt the event was informative, but also that they were leaving with a grim outlook on Ukraine’s future. 
 
Yuliya V. Ladygina, a fellow at Harvard's Ukrainian Research Institute who attended the event, said she thought the panelists were “good and insightful speakers,” who “provided a lot of useful information.” 
 
Kennedy School student Roman Rubchenko agreed that the event was informative, but said he was disappointed with the uncertainty surrounding the issue of Ukraine.
“I think the U.S. government as well as the European Union were caught off guard with this sort of behavior,” Rubchenko said. “I’m just hoping change will come soon enough for Ukraine to benefit from the change.”

Students, resident scholars, and House Masters alike gathered Tuesday evening for a Lowell Masters’ Dinner to discuss climate change and policy-making with renowned environmental science and engineering professor, Daniel P. Schrag.
Schrag, who has researched environmental topics such as climate change and currently serves on President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, began the discussion by explaining the complexity of climate change’s long timescale, and society’s current desire for immediate satisfaction in regards to climate change policies.
 
“Nothing we do in the next 30 years is going to materialize within the next 30 years,” Schrag told those gathered in Lowell’s small dining room.
 
He added that trying to deal with climate change poses the “worst collective action problem the world has ever seen,” since not one, but all, countries must commit to decreasing carbon use and emissions.
 
Part of the solution, Schrag argued, is to electrify as much technology as possible, including cars and trucks, in order to minimize carbon usage and emissions. However, Schrag said that this will be be a long transition, thus we will not see the benefits of our actions for many years.
 
When asked about the usefulness of international negotiations and agreements for promoting caps on fossil fuel emissions, Schrag responded that getting rid of the fossil fuel industries will be extremely difficult given the trillions of dollars of infrastructure already set in place. Instead, Schrag said that people will only stop using coal and other non-renewable sources when other forms of energy become cheaper and more accessible.
 
What proved most surprising to several attendees of the Masters’ Dinner was Schrag’s position on the Keystone XL Pipeline.
 
“This pipeline has become widely inflated in its political value,” Schrag told those gathered in the room, arguing that environmentalists should focus on more long-term solutions to climate change.
 
Davida Fernandez-Barkan, a Lowell House tutor and member of the house programming committee who has taken Schrag’s Climate-Energy Challenge course, said she was “really surprised to hear him say that he was in support of the pipeline,” given his previous work. Fernandez-Barkan added, however, that she understood that “he took a much more political view of the situation.”
 
Some guests were also surprised by Schrag’s analysis of the long timescale involved in addressing climate change. Lowell House tutor and doctoral student in the economics department, Eli B. Schachar, said that while he appreciated Schrag’s engaging discussion, he questioned the possible implications of a long-term view in addressing climate change.
 
“Is our feeling supposed to be ‘this problem is really hard and going to take a long time’ and feel hopeless, or ‘this problem is really hard and going to take a long time’ and let’s talk about some very concrete short-term goals that can help?,” Schachar asked.
 “That’s just to me a more optimistic view of addressing a more complicated issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Billionaire Hong Kong investor and Harvard School of Public Health alumnus Gerald L. Chan has made waves in Harvard Square in recent months with purchases of Square real estate totalling more than $100 million.
Chan’s acquisitions include the property at Winthrop Square, which houses Grendel’s Den and the recently closed UpStairs on the Square, a recently vacated American Express building, and the stretch of property from 18 to 28 JFK St., which includes UNO’s and Papyrus.
One of Chan’s most recent purchases is 39 JFK St., the former home of Leo’s Place Diner and the American Express office, both of which closed after the transfer of ownership. According to an article in Banker and Tradesman, Chan paid $33.15 million for the property.
HONG KONG TO HARVARD
Real estate is nothing new for Chan, who is a non-executive director at Hang Lung Properties Limited, one of the largest real estate companies in Hong Kong, alongside his brother and chairman Ronnie C. Chan. Valued at $2.95 billion, the brothers are ranked 17th on Forbes magazine’s “Hong Kong’s 50 Richest” list.
According to the Banker and Tradesman article, Chan made his purchases through a series of shell companies, which are all connected to Morningside Group, Chan’s investment company. 
 
Julie F. Rafferty, associate vice dean for communications at the HSPH, said that Chan has remained involved with his alma mater since his graduation in 1979.
 “Gerald Chan is an HSPH alumnus who has spoken at HSPH classes and events...and his message has inspired many here at the school. Because he has been an extremely popular speaker, students asked him to be Commencement speaker in 2012,” Rafferty wrote in an email to The Crimson.
 
Chan’s Morningside Group established the Morningside Professorship in Radiobiology at the John B. Little Center for Radiation Science and Environmental Health at HSPH in 2012, according to the group’s website.
Similar to his connections to HSPH, Chan has had ties to Harvard Square since his days as a student and recently purchased a home on Brattle St. According to Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, Chan has fond memories of his time in Harvard Square, and wants to work with the community.
“They have expressed their desire to be great community partners and thus far have proven themselves to be just that,” Jillson said.
OUT WITH THE OLD
Despite the exciting changes brought about by the transitions in ownership, many of Chan’s purchases have been followed by the departure of longtime tenants.
 “The market is what the market is,” Jillson said. “Any purchaser and any developer can pay whatever they deem appropriate.”
Iconic Cambridge bar and restaurant UpStairs on the Square was the first establishment to shut down after Chan’s acquisitions of property. After 31 years of business, the restaurant announced its closing soon after Chan purchased the property at Winthrop Square, and restaurant owners decided not to renew their lease.
While former co-owner of UpStairs on the Square Mary-Catherine Deibel said Chan’s purchase of the property presented a logical time for her to close her establishment. She said she is excited to see what the future of the space holds.
According to Boston Restaurant Talk, a new farm-to-table eatery called Parsnip is slated to open in UpStairs on the Square’s place.
“I think it’s great that the building is staying an indepently owned restaurant,” Deibel said. “It will bring vitality to the Square and, based on what I see so far, the restaurant will be high quality and interesting.”
Similarly, after nine years in the square, Indian bistro Tamarind Bay was forced to close its doors when the restaurant’s rent doubled following Chan’s purchase of the property at 75 Winthrop St.
The space will be occupied by Night Market, a Japanese restaurant operated by Gerald Chan’s son Ash Chan, an entrepreneur who previously owned and operated the liquid nitrogen ice cream shop Churn2.
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE
In spite of all the closures, Chan said he is working to preserve the culture of Harvard Square.
Not all of Chan’s properties are transferring tenants. Grendel’s Den, the bar and restaurant located at 81 Winthrop St., has no plans to change occupancy. According to Kari Kuelzer, co-owner and general manager, their lease does not end until 2020.
“We didn’t renegotiate the lease. We’ve had the lease since 1999 when we had a lease with Gregory Carr,” Kuelzer said, referring to entrepreneur and philanthropist Gregory C. Carr, an alumnus of the Harvard Kennedy School.
“I have not met Mr. Chan, but he has a project manager and an operations manager… they’re very competent people,” Kuelzer said.
She added that Chan’s project manager, Jim Covino, told her that Chan has “a lot of commitment to Harvard Square and preserving the unique character of Harvard Square.”
“They’ve been approached by [chain stores and restaurants]…and have declined to lease space to them so I think they’re after a commercial landscape that includes a lot of local business,” Kuelzer said.
Papyrus, UNO, and The Vitamin Shoppe are all tenants on Chan’s property from 18 to 28 JFK St., but all these businesses declined to comment in accordance with their corporate policies.
Chan is not the first foreign investor to purchase an abundance of property in Harvard Square. Polish immigrant Bertha E. Cohen, who came to Boston in 1905, opened her own hat shop called “Mademoiselle Bertha,” after which she quickly proceeded to purchase her first building.
Cohen continued to amass a number of buildings in Cambridge and Boston. At the time of her death in 1965, she left an estimated $20 million fortune. She was widely known as “the witch of Harvard Square” because of her unwillingness to sell buildings to the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the co-founder of the multibillion dollar financial information company Bloomberg L.P., will address graduates and their families at Harvard’s 363rd Commencement Exercises on May 29, the University announced Wednesday morning.
Bloomberg, who earned his undergraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University and is a 1966 graduate of Harvard Business School, stepped down after three terms as New York City mayor in January.
Over the years, Bloomberg has been a major benefactor of the University, in addition to a wide range of charitable causes. In 1996, he donated $3 million to endow a professorship in his father’s name. Bloomberg was also a major supporter of the 2003-2005 renovation and expansion of the Business School’s Baker Library, which now also bears his family’s name.
“Mike Bloomberg’s career represents a rare blend of public leadership, private sector entrepreneurship, and powerful philanthropic engagement,” University President Drew G. Faust said in the press release. “He has led one of the world’s great cities, built one of the nation’s most influential information services, and generously committed his attention and resources to worthy causes in public health, the environment, civic life, the arts, and—not least of all—education.”
Elected mayor of New York City in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Bloomberg emerged as a popular, if controversial, leader of the nation's largest city. After beefing up the city’s security apparatus in response to the attacks, Bloomberg embraced public health and education reform during his record three terms in office.


Since leaving New York’s City Hall in January, Bloomberg has returned to a leading role in his financial information company and also works with the United Nations as a special envoy for environmental issues.
Bloomberg began his career at Salomon Brothers, a financial services firm, in 1966. After eventually rising to manage all of Salomon’s information systems, Bloomberg left in 1981 to found a startup in financial information services. That company, Bloomberg L.P., now boasts more than 300,000 subscribers to its flagship financial information terminal service and also runs a multi-platform news operation.
 
Harvard's afternoon Commencement exercises, which occur after College seniors have received their diplomas at House ceremonies and follow the awarding of honorary degrees near the end of the morning exercises, traditionally feature an address by the University president, in addition to the keynote speech.
Last year, Faust used her address to call attention to the dangers of the cuts to research funding imposed by the federal sequestration. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey gave the keynote.

CORRECTION: March 5, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated at which point honorary degrees are awarded during each year's Commencement Exercises. In fact, they are given out during the morning exercises.

With the 2014 Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial caucuses coming to a close, Harvard students have thrown their early support behind Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, volunteering for her campaign and backing her in last month’s caucuses in Cambridge’s seventh and eighth wards, where she gained the support of most delegates.
 
“I think the overall reason why we’re seeing so much support for Juliette on campus is because she is a young, exciting face in Massachusetts politics, and she’s progressive, I’d say, more than the other candidates in the race,” said Simon M. Thompson ’14, who is currently leading the group of students supporting Kayyem.
 
Although only 12 to 15 students are registered on the mailing list, Thompson started to recruit student supporters from the Harvard community. He said that he believes this is a strong start.
 
“In terms of being eight to nine months out from the gubernatorial election and having nearly double of that in students who are willing to spend a couple of hours each week helping out, I think that really speaks to the fact that people are excited about her,” Thompson said. “I haven’t heard anyone who is volunteering for Martha Coakley or Steve Grossman.”
 
In an early February poll—the most recent to be released—Kayyem trailed Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley and State Treasurer Steven Grossman.
 
Still, Kayyem’s Harvard supporters said they believe that her progressive politics make her different from the other democratic candidates. 
“I think a lot of Harvard students are liberal, but it takes a specific quality about a candidate to get people excited, and I think it’s her progressiveness,” Jordan T. Weiers ’16 said.
Thompson said he and other Kayyem supporters believe that it is her progressive politics that make her the best candidate to take on the Republican candidate—presumably Charlie Baker—in the general election this November.
“She hasn’t been running for every office for the last 15 years and she’s really got this new vision for Massachusetts that I think will galvanize a lot of support behind her for the general election if she makes it through the Democratic primary,” Thompson said.
Kayyem is a columnist for the Boston Globe on leave from her appointment as a lecturer at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. She is married to Law School professor David J. Barron ’89, a former president of The Crimson, who chairs the Electronic Communications Policy Task Force.

President Obama is scheduled to travel to Cambridge on Wednesday afternoon to attend a roundtable discussion of Democratic Party supporters at the Charles Hotel, according to a White House press release.
 
Obama, a 1991 graduate of Harvard Law School, is scheduled to arrive at The Charles at 4:50 p.m. After the roundtable, which is not open to the public, the President will deliver an address and take questions at a private Democratic National Committee dinner gathering in Boston. 
Obama’s visit will further complicate an already congested traffic pattern in Harvard Square. According to a statement by the Harvard University Police Department, vehicular traffic will nearly be impossible in the vicinity of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, as well as Eliot and Kirkland Houses from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., as several streets will be blocked off.
 
The area will remain open to pedestrians, according to the HUPD announcement.
 
The President has been no stranger to the Boston area in the past year. Last April, Obama presided over an interfaith memorial service in South Boston three days after the bombings at the Boston Marathon. Then, in June, the President visited Roxbury to stump for then-Congressman Edward J. Markey of Malden, who at the time was in a contested race to replace Secretary of State John Kerry in the U.S. Senate.
 
Wednesday will be a full day of travel for the President, who is scheduled to depart the White House at 10:45 a.m. and will visit Central Connecticut State University in Hartford, Conn. to deliver remarks urging the raising of the national minimum wage before travelling to Massachusetts. Obama is scheduled to return to the White House by 10 p.m. Wednesday evening.

Coming off a 14-8 loss at Albany Saturday, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team was looking to rebound with a home win Tuesday afternoon. Hosting Quinnipiac (1-2) in a non-conference contest, the Crimson (2-2) struggled in the first two periods, but turned it around in the second half to escape with a 10-8 win at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium.
For much of the first half, Harvard failed to execute on either side of the field. The Crimson scored the first three goals of the game in a span of three minutes, but then completely stalled, giving up five straight goals.
“I was disappointed in the way that we started,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “I thought we came out looking pretty lackluster, turning the ball over and [were] not fully focused.”
The game started with neither team able to launch a successful offense. The Bobcats dominated the possession battle early, but were unable to capitalize on any opportunities, largely due to several key saves by Crimson junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky.
“We weren’t sharp and struggled to execute at the beginning,” Wojcik said. “We didn’t seem to be completely dialed in at the start.”
With less than seven minutes left in the first quarter, a Harvard attackman was able to draw two defenders before wheeling it around the offense and eventually into the hands of sophomore Deke Burns, who scored from the left side of the goal.
Sophomore midfielder Sean Mahon and senior attackman Carl Zimmerman quickly added scores of their own to give the Crimson a 3-0 advantage. But the  lead would be short-lived, as Quinnipiac netted one to cut the deficit before the end of the first period, then added four straight goals in the second period to go up, 5-3.
“We could have pushed a little harder in the first half,” Gambitsky said. “We didn’t play well and that cost us early.”
The Bobcats took advantage of on a costly series of Harvard penalties. Consecutive violations were committed by Crimson defensemen for slashing and cross-checking to the head, giving the Bobcats a two-man-up opportunity.
Quinnipiac capitalized within 30 seconds on the 6-on-4 play with a score by junior attackman Michael Sagl to put the Bobcats ahead, 4-3. Just two minutes later, Sean McDonagh was called for a slashing penalty, leading to another Quinnipiac goal.
“We want to stay out of the box,” Wojcik said. “But those were hard plays. We’re going to do what it takes to defend our goal, and as long as the penalties are hard but disciplined, we will do what it takes.”
But the Crimson converted on man-advantages of its own. With four minutes left in the half, a Bobcat violation for an illegal stick put Harvard a man-up for three minutes. Schwartz drove a blistering 12-yard shot from the center of the box, cutting the deficit to 5-4 before the end of the first half.
“Adjustments were made at halftime,” Gambitsky said. “We realized that we had played pretty badly in the first half but that personnel-wise, after we were able to feel out what was going on, we were able to tell more clearly what to do.”
In the second half, Harvard looked like a different team. After giving up six turnovers in each of the first two quarters, the team limited itself to only seven for the remainder of the game.
“We made some adjustments and really came out flying in the second half,” Wojcik said. “I wasn’t happy that we couldn’t separate, but at the end of the day, I’m just happy with the team’s ability to find a way to win the game.”
Opening the third period, sophomore midfielder Brendan Newman drove down the side of the defense and drew a defenseman before passing to a wide-open senior midfielder, Daniel Eipp, who then leveled the score at 5-5.
Following another Qunnipiac penalty, sophomore attackman Will Walker drove around the goal after receiving a pass from senior Garett Cambell and nailed the back of the net, giving the Crimson the 6-5 lead.
But the Bobcats never went away. Less than thirty seconds later, sophomore Ryan Keenan caught the ball on the crease for an easy goal to tie the game back up.
Harvard went ahead, 8-6, with nets by Mahon and Campbell, but Quinnipiac cut it to one heading into the final period of play.
With the game still closely contested, Harvard sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka, on what looked like a failed clear, threw the ball as far as he could towards the offensive end.
Sophomore attackman Ian Ardrey beat his defender in a foot race to chase the ball down, poked the ball as if it was a hockey puck past the incoming goalie and into the corner of the field, then scooped it up and found senior midfielder Pat Fiorvanti on the crease for an easy score.
“That was a really big goal for us,” Wojcik said. ”I think that was the one that really took the momentum and gave us control of the game.”
Quinnipiac responded with a goal of its own, but a net by Harvard with less than four minutes left sealed the 10-8 victory.
“We fought hard, but we need to improve on consistency,” Schwartz said. “We’ve had quarters that have been awesome, but we’ve had some that haven’t. We need to play a complete 60 minutes, and that’s what we’re striving for going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A switch to varsity after three decades as a club sport. A 252-61 scoring advantage over opponents in the fall. A four-game winning streak to take down No. 1 seed Dartmouth and capture an Ivy League Championship.
The Harvard rugby team (6-2, 5-1 Ivy) has accomplished a lot in the past year. But it doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
The No. 11 Crimson will continue its inaugural varsity season outside the Ancient Eight this spring. That means unfamiliar—and more experienced—opponents. For Harvard, it means a chance to see how the team measures up against the best and a chance to prove itself on a national level.
“[This spring] is us having an opportunity to make a statement, not just in the Ivy League—which I think we did successfully in the fall—but on a broader national level, that varsity rugby is worth investing in and is great for the players and the schools,” co-captain Xanni Brown said.
The opportunity does not come without challenges. As the Crimson moves into uncharted territory, it will face a series of never-before-seen squads that have already achieved success on the national level.
The team’s first big test is this upcoming Saturday against No. 4 American International College. AIC (5-2) defeated Quinnipiac this fall right after the Bobcats dealt Harvard a 39-10 loss in the Crimson’s season opener.             Harvard will look to shut down the offensive production of senior prop Jessica Davis, who led the Yellow Jackets with 16 tries in the fall.
“I think that we’re going to be tested for sure, and I think that we are probably going to have some setbacks,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “But I think they are the kind of setbacks that we [will] need and we are going to learn from.”
The Crimson’s decisive 22-5 victory over West Chester in its spring opener on Saturday proved that the team can compete against quality competition outside the Ivy League. As the squad’s first game in over four months, the win offered an early boost of confidence for Harvard.
“[West Chester] was one of the teams in which we didn’t know what to expect,” co-captain Brandy Machado said. “There was some trepidation among players because of that. But we went out there, and we played our game.”
As the season progresses, the Crimson will continue to focus on its own game. Facing a new slate of top-tier teams for the first time, Harvard will look to follow its own game plan and style of play, making adjustments as needed.
After a three week interlude following this weekend’s AIC contest, the Crimson will host Boston College. Harvard looks to repeat its success from last season, when the team downed the Eagles, 42-0.
Amidst a demanding schedule, the Crimson plans to focus on more than just wins and losses.
“We like to look at the game in a much more methodical way…to look at what went well, what didn’t go well, and truly map out our improvement,” Parker said. “We’ll take a look at how we perform in each game and figure out where we are.”
Harvard will hit the road the first weekend in April, travelling to No. 1 Penn State. The Nittany Lions have won four of the past five national championships and will provide a litmus test for the Crimson just weeks before the season-ending national tournament.
Harvard’s success will depend on strong offensive contributions from  Brown, the team’s leading scorer. Senior scrumhalf Shelby Lin and junior flanker Lenica Morales-Valenzuela have also been pivotal components of the Crimson’s scoring production.
After facing Penn State, Harvard returns home for a matchup against a local club team, Beantown. This game has special meaning for the Crimson, as it will put the team up against many familiar faces. Among these will be Harvard’s own assistant coach, Kelly Seary ’09, who plays flyhalf for the Beantown club.
Heading into the national championships, the team will rely heavily on the expertise and experience of Parker. Before joining the Crimson this past August, Parker headed the women’s rugby program at Navy from 2002-2008 and 2011-2013 and led the team to several Final Four appearances.
“Coaches tend to coach similarly from one year to the next when they’re at the same program,” Parker said. “[We will] use some of that information to put our defensive and tactical game plans to work to exploit other teams’ weaknesses and hopefully neutralize some of their strengths.”
The team has set a high bar going into the season with the goal to become the best collegiate team in the nation. But this does not just mean winning nationals.
“We want to be a team…that people respect,” Machado said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team sat in its locker room, upset and angry, Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The Crimson (23-5-4, 16-3-3 ECAC) had just lost a double-overtime game to Yale, 3-2. The players knew they were 0-2-1 against the Bulldogs (9-16-7, 6-9-7) on the year and that they would have to beat Yale twice in a row to advance in the ECAC Tournament.
That’s when Harvard interim coach Maura Crowell turned to freshman backup goalie Brianna Laing and gave her a surprise in front of the whole team before leaving the locker room.
Laing would start the next game.
The freshman stayed composed but admitted she was nervous after she got the assignment. Laing had started only five regular season games, and though she had played in many high school and club tournaments, she knew this one came with a “different pressure.”
Her nerves disappeared Saturday morning, Laing said, but they did not stay gone for long. When the Bulldogs scored with less than seven minutes to go in the contest, taking a 2-1 lead, she understood the implications that it might have for Harvard’s season. But Laing’s teammates stepped up, scoring two minutes later and then again in double-overtime to earn a third game with Yale.
After the win, Crowell surprised Laing again, telling her she would start the following day. Laing had not logged back-to-back games for the Crimson before, but she performed even better Sunday, shutting out the Bulldogs in a 4-0 victory.
“I was a little more nervous on Saturday because I hadn’t been put in that situation before,” Laing said. “On Sunday, I just felt more comfortable and knew what I was doing.”
The win advanced Harvard to the ECAC semifinals against Cornell (22-5-4, 15-4-3) this coming Saturday. It also forced Crowell to make the choice again: Laing or sophomore starter Emerance Maschmeyer. The team did not practice Monday or Tuesday, meaning Crowell will have to decide who is playing better based on limited practice time.
Laing did more than save 62 shots over two days, she saved Harvard’s season. But now she’s prepared to hand the reins back to Maschmeyer, who is third in the country in save percentage.
“I’m pretty positive that Emerance will be playing because she has been so amazing this season,” Laing said.
Maschmeyer has already earned a win and a tie against the Big Red this season. In the first contest, Harvard held a 2-0 lead entering the third period but Cornell scored three times to earn a 3-3 draw in Cambridge in November.
At Cornell’s Lynah Rink in January, the Crimson took a 3-1 lead and did not relinquish it, winning for its first victory in Ithaca since the 2008-2009 season. Those two results give Harvard confidence heading into Saturday’s matchup in Potsdam, N.Y.
“Taking three points from Cornell has to be a first for us in a few years so we know we can play with them,” Crowell said. “We feel very confident against them.”
The winner Saturday will face either Clarkson or Quinnipiac in the ECAC Final Sunday. Saturday’s game can be viewed online on the America One Sports, while Sunday’s contest will be streamed on ESPN3.
At the beginning of the year, the Crimson was not expected to compete for a spot in the tourney, but members of the program did not lower their expectations.
“We expect to win and anything short of going all the way would be disappointing,” Crowell said.
Cornell comes into the matchup more rested after dispatching Princeton with a two-game sweep, but Crowell said Harvard’s struggles last weekend fit in with the team’s narrative.
“We’ve been overcoming things in our locker room, numbers and all sorts of situations so it just plays into that,” Crowell said. “I don’t think it will be a factor on Saturday…. They’ll be ready to go .”
In fact, Crowell said the 12 periods of hockey Harvard played in three days could be a benefit.
“Those three games, I think they make us a better playoff team than others,” Crowell said. “We gained a ton of experience, a ton of confidence.”
Harvard fans certainly learned a lot about Brianna Laing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, news broke that a second installment of the Rivalry On Ice will take place between the Harvard and Yale men’s hockey teams in 2015. However, the rivalry is set to renew itself even sooner.
After picking up two points during the season’s final weekend, the Crimson (10-15-4, 6-12-4 ECAC) received the 11th seed in the conference tournament, earning itself a trip to New Haven to take on the sixth-seeded Bulldogs (15-9-5, 10-8-4) this weekend.
“We’ve played Yale three times, so we pretty much know what we’re going to get,” sophomore defenseman Patrick McNally said. “They like to play it fast, they like to play offensively, [and] they like to get their [defense] up in the rush. We’ve got to be ready for all of that.”
Harvard will have its work cut out for it against the defending national champions. Ranked No. 15/16 in the nation, the Bulldogs are currently on the bubble for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, likely needing to make a postseason run to secure a spot in the field for the fifth time in the last six years.
On the other hand, there is only one way the Crimson can expect to hear its name called on Selection Sunday—by winning the ECAC tournament. That quest will begin Friday night at Ingalls Rink in the opening game of a best-of-three series.
“We’re expecting it to be a hostile environment,” sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo said. “We know they’re going to come out firing, especially trying to defend the national championship last year. They obviously don’t want to go out in the first round.”
These Ivy League rivals have certainly seen plenty of each other this season, as the two sides have met three times. In their most recent tilt in February, Yale mustered three power-play goals against Harvard’s then league-best penalty kill unit en route to a 5-2 victory. The Bulldogs also bested the Crimson in the inaugural Rivalry on Ice matchup, 5-1, on January 11.
Harvard’s best performance against Yale came back in December. The Crimson appeared poised to knock off the defending champions after goals from freshman forwards Alexander Kerfoot and Luke Esposito put Harvard up by two heading into the third period. However, the Bulldogs stormed back with two tallies of their own in the final frame to earn a 2-2 tie.
“We tied them at their place, so we know we can play with them,” McNally said. “Obviously the results we got two weekends ago and at Madison Square Garden weren’t what we wanted, but we knew that they weren’t anything special or anything we [couldn’t] handle. We’ve just got to go in and play our game and hope for the best result.”
If the Crimson hopes to advance past the first round, it will need to find a way to break Yale goaltender Alex Lyon. The freshman has recorded 77 saves and allowed just one even-strength goal against Harvard this season.
On the other end of the ice, the Crimson will have to be wary of the Bulldogs’ senior duo of Jesse Root and Kenny Agostino, which has combined for 59 points this year.
This will be the second time in three years that the Crimson has played Yale in the postseason, as the two sides met in the 2011-2012 quarterfinals. Harvard dropped the first game but won the next two, including a double overtime thriller in game two, in which now-senior captain Dan Ford netted the game-winner.
The Crimson fell just shy of receiving an NCAA tournament berth that year, falling to Union in the ECAC championship game. The team last reached the  national tournament in 2006 in Harvard coach Ted Donato’s ’91 second season at the helm.
Now, coming off strong performances against two ranked teams last weekend, the Crimson will look to carry its momentum into the playoffs and end its eight-year tournament drought. Harvard has won eight out of nine postseason contests against the Bulldogs, but the team still has a difficult task ahead.
“We’ve been trying to play our best hockey come this time of year,” Criscuolo said. “Yale’s obviously a great opponent, but it’s also a rivalry for us, so we’re going to go into it taking one game at a time. [We want to] keep playing like we’ve been playing as of late and hopefully ride it out.”

Happy Wednesday! Congratulate your sleep-deprived self for continuing to chug through a long week of studying, midterms, and paper-writing because the end is almost here! And if you still have a ton of work to do, here’s a guide to help you determine where you should study tonight:
Your dining hall: You know that there’s no better way to offset the misery of catching up on all of your readings than eating inordinate amounts of Cinnamon Toasters as you do it. 
Lamont: You’re preemptively calling an all-nighter (or something close to it), and you need other sleep-deprived people around you to hold you accountable as you work (a.k.a. people to judge you for logging onto Facebook every 2 minutes) into the late hours of the night.
Cabot: You for some reason want to partake in all of the pre-med students’ collective sorrows.
Widener: You’re either in the mood to hide away from all your friends by working in the stacks or to ignore the fact that your paper is due in less than 12 hours by admiring the beauty of the Phillips Reading Room. 
Your room: You’re telling all your roommates that you’re going to do work, but it’s secretly a cover-up for binging on Netflix and then going to bed.
 
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The high today is only 28 degrees and it’ll be a chilly 10 degrees at night, so bundle up accordingly! There’s also a 30 percent chance of snow later today, so you’re probably wondering how many days in a row you can wear your snow boots without it being a faux pas.

Every year, students all over the world are thrilled to receive acceptance letters to Harvard and other Ivy League schools. It’s a sign that their hard work in school has finally paid off, and that they are on their way to accomplishing even more. But for a large portion of admitted students, it’s not the acceptance letter that guarantees the diploma–it’s the financial aid letter.
While the financial aid package ensures that a student will be able to attend college for the next four years, it doesn’t mean the end of all financial worries.
My family falls well below Harvard’s $250,000 income cutoff for financial aid, so paying for school was never a concern. However, my financial standing did raise some concerns in the weeks leading up to move-in day. I was worried that I’d be judged for not having as many clothes as my classmates, and I didn’t want to feel left out when they talked about their extravagant vacations abroad.
I will admit that I was extremely intimidated on move-in day when I saw some of my new classmates walking through the yard with Louis Vuitton suitcases, something I could only ever dream of owning. I quickly began to panic and start thinking that Harvard might not actually be the right place for me.
This fear was assuaged as I got to learn more about my classmates. I realized that financial differences were irrelevant here. Students don’t look to be friends with the people with the most money; they look to be friends with the people whose company they most enjoy. Income usually becomes the topic of discussion in only the most intimate conversations.
It’s true that I and other low income students aren’t able to eat out as often as other students, but this is one of the few rare times when these differences become evident. Luckily, midterm season arrives just in time to cut those pricey dinners short, once again putting everyone in the same boat. In my opinion, being a poor fish in a rich pond is nothing to be concerned about. In a school like this, the wealth of their classmates is the last thing on any student’s mind.
