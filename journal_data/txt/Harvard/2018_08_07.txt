After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first rule at Double Whammies, the Hooters-like roadside sports bar where Lisa Conroy (Regina Hall) works, is, in all-caps: “NO DRAMA!” The second? “The four B’s: Be responsible, be informed, be friendly, be sexy.” It’s in this environment of carefully regulated femininity—unthreatening, overtly sexual, almost literally palatable—that Lisa becomes an unlikely maternal figure for her employees, from waitresses to kitchen staff. As the manager, Lisa is charged with putting out one fire after another, all while dealing with her depressive husband (Lawrence Varnado).
And there are many fires, big and small. The film begins with an attempted burglary, which snowballs into an arrest. One waitress, Danyelle (Shayna McHayle), brings in her sick son. Another waitress, Shaina (Jana Kramer), encounters legal problems with a troublesome boyfriend. A third waitress, Maci (Haley Lu Richardson), engages in a less-than-professional relationship with a client, while Jennelle (Dylan Gelula), an entrepreneurially-minded new recruit, brainstorms scandalous ways to streamline business. All the while, Lisa approaches her job in its unwieldy messiness with dogged, borderline delusional idealism. “This is a mainstream place, and it’s a family place, which means that a lot of families come here,” she tells a line-up of new recruits at a group interview. “It also means that we’re all family.”
As much as Lisa tries to extol the “family” virtues of working for Double Whammies, director Andrew Bujalski undercuts her optimism with the hard reality of her environment. With a surprising dose of honesty, “Support the Girls” escapes the precarious pitfall of becoming a feel-good morality fable. Instead, Bujalski trains a keen eye on a forgotten corner of humanity, one that bristles with unexpected poignancy and spirit—and gestures, too, at the surprising effect of one person’s empathy and tenacious hope.
“Support the Girls” relies on a delicate equilibrium of drama and comedy, seriousness punctuated occasionally with bursts of surprising humor. A recently fired waitress (AJ Michalka) gets a massive, inflamed tattoo of Steph Curry on her ribcage (“No, I get it. It’s a black man’s face on a white girl’s body,” she says morosely while Lisa stifles laughter next to her). A misplaced confetti cannon interrupts a sad moment. A burglar in a stretcher is ushered out of the bar in broad daylight, and Maci, ill-advisedly cheerful, shouts, “Hey Lisa! Totally nobody noticed!” Does the humor fall flat sometimes? Yes. And is it in poor taste? Most likely. But it befits the film, which at times can feel like a parody of itself, one tacky facet of ridiculous, down-home Americana exposed at a time.
The eccentric comedy might be misplaced, if it weren’t so desperately welcome. Bujalski does not sugarcoat or shy away from the harsh truth, intercutting scenes of cheerful waitress camaraderie with bleak, monotonous sequences of the highway and scenes of leering men ogling the waitresses like meat. Sexism and racism intersect when only one black waitress is allowed to work per shift. Violence and brutality linger at the film’s margins, just out of shot. Bujalski’s filmic technique supports this hefty, emotional undertaking—two shots of a bubbling vat of grease, which bookend a particularly tense scene, could teach a master class on the Kuleshov effect. “Support the Girls” works subversively with preconceived expectations: The illusory safety of suburbia quickly evaporates when a seemingly well-to-do neighborhood becomes the scene of a literal punch in the gut, violence depicted so uneventfully that it seems callous. Meanwhile, a tacky breastaurant becomes the unlikely site of solidarity and sisterhood.
Though “Support the Girls” derives much of its heart from its ensemble cast, Bujalski’s artistic commitment to an honest portrayal of working class life hinges on one character. As Lisa, Regina Hall exudes a kind of delightful, non-movie star plainness that melds seamlessly with her surroundings. Standing next to a line-up of scantily clad waitresses, Lisa embodies protective maternal energy in her pink button-down. But if “maternal energy” conjures an image of faiblesse, that would be wholly incorrect. In a world governed by the wants and needs of men, Lisa knows how to work the system. She goes to bat for young women without power, even at the expense of her own happiness, but she’s also willing to take the approach of discipline when she sees fit. There’s no real reason for her to stay committed to this job, yet she approaches it with a brand of can-do spirit and genuine affection for her employees. Although Lisa’s optimism is undoubtedly delusional, Hall’s earnestness almost makes you believe in her vision for this world: one of familial love among coworkers who have no real loyalty, neither to each other, nor toward this establishment.
But even the best leadership is not enough to save the Double Whammies staff from falling prey to the capitalist machine, turning to Mancave, a major franchise, for employment when their job security is jeopardized. Eventually, when push comes to shove, even dedicated Lisa sits for an interview with big business. Although “Support the Girls” is primarily a character sketch, it’s secondarily and subtly a film about the workplace—and when it comes to corporate greed, an unforgiving one at that. If establishments like Double Whammies inhumanely commodify female bodies, then big franchises like Mancave magnify this inhumanity in a way that feels like an even greater failure to recognize humanity—streamlining objectification with the ease of factory assembly. “As you well know, one of the joys and challenges of our concept is that much of our workforce is young girls,” says Lisa’s executive interviewer (Brooklyn Decker). “Who, full disclosure, are lovely, but are not brain surgeons… Here, they just do a really good job of idiot-proofing the whole thing.” Lisa tries to remain politely impassive, but it’s obvious what she’s thinking and what Bujalski is suggesting. Maybe the best kind of love is not to be taken care of, but to be taken seriously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I’m just gonna make you hotter,” announced Carly Rae Jepsen late Saturday afternoon. It had been a taxing day by all accounts—festival-goers, many of whom were going into their third full day of full-bodied jamming, found themselves marinated in sweltering temperatures and sticky humidity. Not one to let mere weather get the best of her, Jepsen took a couple of moments between songs to recount a story of how fellow performer Cyndi Lauper dealt with heat and followed in her footsteps by removing her shoes. And while shoe removal is in itself a relatively mundane task, the episode taken as a whole—the jovial commentary on the situation, the reference to an earlier pop legend, the nerve involved in actually going barefoot on a hot summer stage in front of hundreds of people—is quite emblematic of Carly Rae Jepsen the performer. She’s got quirk and a strong bearing on pulse of pop music. but she also has undeniable edge.
In Schrödinger-esque fashion, Jepsen actively maintains a strange dichotomy as a performer. On one hand, there’s campy Jepsen, a lovely and intensely-memeable figure who has understandably inspired a cult following. On the other, there’s an intensely mature artist whose genuinely great work is routinely snubbed by the public from a commercial standpoint. Buried under the delectable pop hooks exists a superposition of both of these selves. These qualities were very much evident in the singer’s show this festival.
Take, for example, her set design: Rather than utilizing the screen available at Lake Shore, Jepsen adorned the stage with tinsel-looking fringe. Tacky as it might appear, the backdrop was one of the more successful on the stage so far this year, with the billowing material uniformly filling up the space in a display of trompe-l’oeil that shifted attention away from the setting’s size and more towards the performer. Moreover, Jepsen refreshingly embraced the success of “Call Me Maybe,” rather than run away from its near-inescapable cultural presence for better or for worse. These sorts of minute decisions, both whimsically inventive and practical, are the hallmark of who Jepsen as an artist is, and it follows that her music shares a similar characteristic depth.
Don’t mistake bubblegum sound for bubblegum content. The 80s-inspired synth pop repertoire almost masks more adult themes such as loss and longing. The design of today’s show was quite meticulous in this regard, excluding some undeniably happy hits including “Good Time” and drawing most heavily from her critically acclaimed album “Emotion.” Though songs were delivered with levity—during “Run Away With Me,” she playfully looked over at drummer as if to check if he was paying attention, and “All That” featured a live saxophonist—the set almost entirely meshed as a representation of love denied and, in response, love desperately coveted. Clever moments such as the pairing of “Boy Problems” and an amped-up “When I Needed You” (the implied source of those problems when played subsequently) to create a two-song subplot are made possible because of a thoughtfully curated setlist. Jepsen’s got a fair share of hits, but they rest on the razor blade of our selection, and she has demonstrated that she isn’t opposed to killing her darlings.
Contextualized, the set is successful on a superficial and a deeper level—not only is it smothered with pop sensibility, but it effectively packages otherwise heavy material. But of course, no review of Jepsen’s set is complete without addressing the elephant in the room. Fans had been working diligently throughout the set to distribute inflatable swords to the pop star, a tireless effort which finally reaped dividends when the fake weapons were ironically wielded in her closer “Cut To The Feeling.” And you’ve got to give Jepsen credit for staying so completely on brand, embellishing her song with a breathless, squeal-like exclamation of “Oh yeah, a sword!” But fun as it was, make no mistake: Today’s actions were no Excalibur moment. Jepsen’s faux-ceremonial knighting merely provided the physical embodiment of a sword visible for the general public to lock onto. For those paying attention, she’s always had it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s immensely difficult for a highly-anticipated act to pull off a surprising entrance, but Walk the Moon accomplished just that. As the crowd stood around chatting, a full-volume recording of “Circle of Life” first pierced then hurtled through the standing area, displacing all else in its path. Not unlike the sun rising on the Serengeti, the warmth of the band was present and itching to reach its zenith. The introduction was followed by an upbeat rendition of “One Foot.” Lead singer Nicholas Petricca galavanted across the stage strumming an air guitar so furiously like it was a conduit for the euphonic blast streaking the crowd. These opening bars were the prelude to an upwelling of bright sound and an even brighter outlook, a musical and thematic anchoring point of the show which, while perhaps not the most thought-provoking, fed a solid set nonetheless.
From the opening notes, it was abundantly evident that each paint-splattered member of Walk the Moon was entirely bought into broadcasting joy. While Petricca was a dominant force given his position in the band, he did not at all upstage the other members. “Lisa Baby” featured guitarist Eli Maiman as the rest of the band lifted their arms skyward, as though they were stretching for some celestial target pulled in by their music and now just within reach. “Portugal” was a definite high point of the show, as member Kevin Ray slammed a drum amid his guitar playing and stunning backing vocals. Not content with a reputation as simply a musician, however, he moved to an elevated box on “Shiver Shiver” and danced for a bit, alternating between shaking his hips and doing the stanky leg which earned raucous fanfare. Grant Park is a colossal stage, but at no moment did any part of it feel untouched by the band’s work.
While the majority of the set was marked by jubilant allegro, a stretch of music in the middle managed to sift slower tracks into the fold of the band’s crusade of positivity. “Shall we get intimate again?” asked the bridge of the “Shiver Shiver,” and the band soon delivered an answer. The next stretch, however, provided the band the opportunity to more clearly connect with viewers. Preaching love and acceptance regardless of background, the artists urged the crowd to sing along to “Different Colors.” It was a nice show of solidarity for a band that oftentimes prefers musical sound rather than make an overtly political message. “Surrender,” one of their tracks with a noticeably muted vibe, was situated effectively in this nook in the set—one can imagine the dissonance of coming down into it from “Portugal,” for instance—and offered up an opportunity for everyone to catch their breath without losing too much steam.
As the pace picked back up, the strategy behind Walk the Moon’s schtick came into clearer focus: It’s awfully hard to go wrong with a warm set executed by warm people. Indeed, the band is unwilling to allow the mood to slow for very long, and we’re all the better for it. Things were quickly picked back up with “Tightrope,” during which the members somehow found the available arm space to lead the crowd in some coordinated hand movements. “Shut Up and Dance” fed off the joy of communion, its run through the charts having clearly settled into the collective consciousness of fans and casual listeners alike. Their penultimate song “Headphones” from their newest album, trading out bright production with harsh speaking, was a strange departure from the rest of the show and kept barely buoyant only by Petricca’s charming antics. Fortunately, this digression was quickly rectified by a return to form in closing number “Anna Sun.” Taken together, the set was not unlike a plate of comfort food: Classic, sating, the type of thing that one might not find intriguing but would clearly consume again (and gladly).
Though the band stumbled once or twice, it kept up a consistent luster throughout the show. It was as though Walk the Moon had brought an ultraviolet light machine onto stage, jetting invisible radiance onto the eager crowd. As the set concluded, Walk the Moon directed listeners to go out and spread their positivity to the communities around them, and with the memory of their euphoric pop-rock show in memory, it seems likely that those audience members might look past the cliché and do just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before we tuck into the heartier sound bites, here’s a quick amuse-bouche from Kweku Collins, a young Evanston-based rapper who performed Sunday afternoon. Between songs, he reflected on trying to push to the front during Tame Impala’s Friday performance, calling on fellow male festival-goers to be mindful of their space when wading through crowds: “To all the men in the audience: Your presence is not a burden until you make yourself a burden.” Isn’t that nice? Anyway, onto the article.
Nnamdi Ogbonnaya
Everyone onstage for rapper Nnamdi Ogbonnaya’s kickoff set repped their own personal rainbow. Ogbonnaya himself wore a tank top, capri sweats, and sneakers all printed with their own mismatching rainbow art. As is true for most musicians, Ogbonnaya and his band’s choice of clothes resembled their style of music: violent clashes whose beauty and truth lie in their chaos. Ogbonnaya matched dirty, scratchy punk guitars with sweet vocal harmonies. His varied singing style perhaps best represents his impressive range. He’ll switch from rapping clever, rapid-fire plays on words in “hOp Off” to repeatedly howling simple lines, like, “I just wanna, wanna be loved” in “Me 4 Me.”
Ogbonnaya’s music so accurately captures all of the disparate parts of being a young person: Sometimes you’re a cryptic intellectual, but other times you cry for your mommy. While Ogbonnaya explores all the angst of being young, he spends the same amount of time on sincere joy—he’s having fun even when he’s pissed. He jolts his body into goofy dance moves. He slams you with electric, googly-eyed stares. He squeals into the mic, because, why not? Ogbonnaya’s 30-minute set felt like five (time flies when you’re having fun), and the audience, so charged with the rapper’s explosive energy, not ready for it to be over, begged for an encore.
(Sandy) Alex G
Disclaimer: Are you familiar with Shakespeare’s 130th sonnet? Keep it in mind before you get all hot and bothered.
Rumor has it that indie rocker Alex Giannascoli will be featured on the next season of “Queer Eye.” He’s trading in his wrinkled blue Oxford shirt for something patterned and French tuck-able. He’s throwing away—no, burning—his black leather New Balance sneakers. He’s found a pair of jeans that doesn’t sag in the ass. Giannascoli should not be a good performer—for reasons other than his disheveled appearance. For example, his face often gets stuck in a semi-permanent grimace, causing him to sing everything through gritted teeth. Is he in constant pain? Probably. Most of his songs sound like the musical manifestation of crying in slow motion. While he plays, he rocks back and forth in a seizure-like way, unless he’s “dancing” (in which case, he’s full-on convulsing) during rowdier numbers like the scream-filled “Brick.” And while most artists spend their sets demanding their audiences to “make some noise,” Giannascoli will screech, “SHUT UP!” if there’s too much yelling for his taste.
Despite all this—or maybe because of it, since the tortured boy aesthetic will always be in—Giannascoli’s live shows inspire wild adoration, and his Sunday Pitchfork set was no exception. There’s realness in Giannascoli’s roughness, and his music is soft enough to keep you singing along. It’s refreshing to see musicians onstage with only the music in mind—completely disregarding the cheese of rockstardom, except to mock it. (Exhibit A: The band members walking onstage while blasting the Rascal Flatts version of “Life is a Highway,” made famous by the Pixar movie Cars.) Plus, they even brought out Michelle Zauner of Japanese Breakfast to sing the lullaby-esque “Brite Boy” with Giannascoli. What more could an audience possibly ask for?
Irreversible Entanglements
Most Pitchfork attendees go to the festival in search of indie rock, rap, and artists who mix the two (Noname, Nnamdi Ogbonnaya, Kweku Collins covering “Maps” by Yeah Yeah Yeahs in order to lure more hipsters to his set, etc.). Free jazz is a less popular genre among loyal Urban Outfitters customers—and, to be honest, I personally had no intention of seeing Irreversible Entanglements. (Guilty as charged—where else would I have gotten these cat-eye sunglasses?)
So, naturally, it’s surprising that the energy emanating from the Red Stage on Sunday afternoon drew troves of crowd members to see Irreversible Entanglements. Booming drums, thundering bass, and lightning flashes from the trumpet and saxophone created an infinite loop of momentum that effortlessly evolved and devolved as the set barreled on. Frontwoman and poet Camae Ayewa (also known as Moor Mother) let her body convulse with the music before she began to improvise poetry, standing still and staring with fierce intensity at one side of the stage. With lines like, “She was five and knew how to play dead on the floor of the church / At what age do we teach our daughters that monsters are real?,”  it was exhilarating to watch Ayewa reach into horrifying realities of racism and string together such rattling poetry. It would’ve been impossible for any member of Irreversible Entanglements to simply go through the motions—they needed to be severely in sync with themselves and one another in order to maintain their 50 minute-long improvisation, during which they harnessed the power of pushing their instruments, voices, and poetry to their limits.
Noname
Some musicians are admired (the crowd goes “Wow,”) while others are adored (the crowd goes “Aww”). Chicago-based rapper Noname, with her permanently lit up doe-eyes, her full giggles, and her boundless charm, is really, really adorable. Her music offers gorgeously earnest meditations on being a perfectly imperfect teenager, effortlessly rolling off her tongue like she’s whispering to you as you doze off in the same bed, getting lulled to sleep by deep conversations between best friends.
Unfortunately, Noname’s style translates a bit weirdly to live performances—it’s almost as if she (and her music) are too passive for the festival stage. It wasn’t her primary concern to give the audience an amazing show—when she stopped in the middle of one of her songs, she apologized, saying, “I smoked before this and forgot the lyrics,” with a little laugh. But Noname is lovable because she’s so real and she doesn’t make a huge deal out of her relative fame—the crowd was hyped nonetheless.

]But they were so hyped that they often drowned out her mellow energy, the same way the punchy bass and drums made her unassuming rapping style sound a lot like mumbling. Not too long into the set, Noname asked her bandmates how much time was left. She seemed disappointed when they told her there were “20 whole minutes,” so she played one song and left the stage with at least 10 minutes to spare, causing fans to groan. An audience member, though disappointed, sympathized with the young rapper: “Let her live,” she said.

The Graduate School of Design has selected two firms to spearhead the expansion of its main campus building, Gund Hall, the school announced last month.
The school picked firms Herzog & de Meuron and Beyer Blinder Belle to design the expansion. Plans for the design are projected to be finished in early fall.
Gund Hall, a building with studio and office space for around 500 students and 100 faculty and staff, opened in 1972. The hall contains classrooms, workshops, darkrooms, as well as a library and auditorium.
According to a press release from Herzog & de Meuron, the goal of the expansion is to transform Gund Hall into a “twenty-first century hub of design innovation.” The suggested design links the hall’s front facade to the GSD’s backyard, introducing a new entry on Quincy St. and improving accessibility in and around the building.
Mohsen Mostafavi, the Dean of the Graduate School of Design, wrote in an emailed statement both firms have “important institutional experience.”
He wrote that Beyer Blinder Belle’s work at Harvard spans over 14 years, and he referred to the firm’s work on the Winthrop and Adams House renewals. Motafavi also wrote that Herzog & de Meuron founders Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have contributed to the school in various ways over the past three decades, teaching classes and presenting exhibitions.
“They are very familiar with the evolution of the School, and are in touch with the ways in which the unique architecture of Gund Hall feeds into the School's culture,” Mostafavi wrote.
Elizabeth R. Leber, partner at Beyer Blinder Belle, wrote in an email statement the firm was “delighted” to be working on the project.
“Gund Hall looms large in the memory of so many who have passed through — and spent a lot of time in — the building,” she wrote. “It’s a project that presents many exciting opportunities and we are honored that the GSD has chosen to partner with our team.”
In the press release, Herzog and Meuron said they hope to “transform” the building.
“We have always admired the intellectual spirit and free-thinking atmosphere of the school with its mythic Gund Hall building, and can now transform this building by excavating, adding, and connecting spaces that will support communication and exchange within the GSD community,” they said.

Former members of Harvard’s shuttered chapter of sorority Delta Gamma have formed a new co-ed social group called Kali Praxi — KP for short — “in response” to Harvard’s social group policy, KP members announced in a press release Monday.
KP affiliate Basia Rosenbaum ’18 wrote in an email that the new group is “distinct” from the old sorority chapter. She said many — but not all — of KP’s current members are former members of DG, and that the organization has already drawn interest from people not previously involved with DG.
“While the two groups may be similar in mission and some of  the KP’s initial membership, the KP will seek to have a diverse membership of people from all backgrounds, regardless of gender or previous affiliation with Delta Gamma,” she wrote. “[DG] looks forward to expanding its membership in the fall.”
The group chose the name “Kali Praxi” because it means “good deed” in Greek, Rosenbaum wrote.
When Harvard’s chapter of DG announced it was closing its doors last week, it became the first single-gender group to shut down in response to the College’s social group policy. The sanctions, which took effect for the Class of 2021, bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
DG’s closure drew widespread media attention as an example of the most severe consequences of Harvard’s controversial social policy to date. But the formation of KP brings DG more in line with other campus sororities, two of whom — Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma — recently disaffiliated from their national chapters to form independent, co-ed groups.
Still, the move marks a tectonic shift from Delta Gamma’s earlier stance. The group had declared this spring that it would not change its policies because of the College’s social group sanctions.
KP will not attempt to formally recruit students until the College recognizes it, Rosenbaum wrote. Campus social groups that earn Harvard recognition gain freedom from the sanctions and access to a variety of benefits including funding and the ability to use College space.
Harvard recently debuted a three-tiered framework for social group recognition; KP will aim for “Interim Recognition,” the third and lowest tier, according to Rosenbaum. This means the group must commit to going gender-neutral — and prove it by submitting demographic breakdowns and related governing documents to Harvard — in exchange for freedom from the sanctions for one year. KP will also have to appoint an official to liaise between the group and the College and will need to adopt required trainings around topics including sexual assault prevention.
Rosenbaum declined to comment on whether members of the new group communicated with College administrators in the months before they launched KP.
Former DG members are founding KP because of what they call a “deficit in community spaces” caused by the sanctions, according to the press release. The release states some fraternity and sorority members quit Greek life at Harvard because of the penalties.
The possible detrimental impact of Harvard’s social group policies on all-female groups — which lack the real estate, wealth, and long-standing alumni networks some all-male groups possess — has long been a topic of heated debate on campus. In March, College administrators announced they would not implement a previously proposed “bridge” program that would have given traditionally all-female organizations a longer period of time than their male counterparts to transition to co-ed membership.
Instead, Harvard announced it would allocate resources and personnel, like the Harvard College Women’s Center, specifically to help women’s groups make the switch.
Asked about KP, Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an email that the College is “committed to ensuring a variety of gender-inclusive social spaces and programming for all students.”
He pointed to College initiatives to fund and host some social events and plans to renovate the underclassmen houses as examples of College efforts to promote community on campus.
Social groups have until August 15 to apply for College recognition for the coming school year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Historic men’s clothing boutique J. Press — a Harvard Square fixture for 86 years — is closing its Mt. Auburn St. store at the end of August, citing increasing rents in the past several years.
“J. Press takes its history at this location very seriously and tried to work for a way to keep it,” Jun Murakami, President of J. Press USA, wrote in a statement. “But given the increasing rents in the area over the past several years, it did not work.”
J. Press currently leases the first floor of its 82 Mt. Auburn St. location from the Fly Club. Another tenant — the all-female Bee Club — moved out of the building in fall 2017.
“It’s unfortunate to have to shut our Cambridge shop after all these years,” Murakami wrote in a separate press release. “We appreciate the community’s patronage over the years and thank our loyal customers who have supported the J. Press brand for generations.”
The label describes itself as “a storied American clothing label, having dressed men of the Ivy League for the past century,” according to the press release.
In particular, J. Press specializes in the “Ivy League look,” a style whose heyday came in the mid-20th century. Of more than a dozen men’s clothing stores in the Square that carried the style at the time, only J. Press and fellow haberdashery the Andover Shop have remained.
In the intervening years, J. Press has continued to stock its storefronts with the high-end coats and silk ties that had been popular among College students and other Harvard affiliates.
Daniel Maxton, assistant manager of the store, said he started off as a customer during his time as an Extension School student.
“It’s such an iconic brand,” Maxton said. “It’s been great having an opportunity to work here and learn this side of the industry as well.”
“There are hills and valleys,” Denis E. Black, former manager of J. Press, said in a 2006 interview with Fifteen Minutes Magazine. Black first started at J. Press’ Harvard Square location in the late 1970s.
Black added that patrons have always come in for advice on “good taste” and “appropriate” dress.
“They come for the tradition,” he said at the time.
J. Press opened its flagship store in New Haven in 1902, and later opened stores in Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Cambridge, Mass.
While the boutique will close its doors at the end of the month, J. Press will seek out other locations in which to operate. Last year, the store re-opened its New York location after it had been closed for several years to seek out new retail space.
Murakami wrote that J. Press hopes to open another Cambridge location soon.
“The brand wishes to maintain a presence in the city, one in which it has a long history and a passionate customer base,” he wrote.
In the meantime, it will continue to serve customers in the Greater Boston area through its website, according to the Monday press release.
The store’s last day will be Aug. 29.
