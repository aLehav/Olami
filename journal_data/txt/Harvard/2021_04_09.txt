After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty One Pilots released their newest single, “Shy Away,” on April 7, after almost a year of no releases. Released to build excitement for their upcoming sixth studio album, “Scaled and Icy,” the song takes bold steps. Possibly indicating a slightly new direction for the group, “Shy Away” acts as a litmus test for the band as they wade into new waters with a more upbeat, electronic pop style.
Immediately, the single comes off as unlike any of the band’s previous work. While leaning into the synth-pop and electronic-funk side of their combined musical history, the duo builds a sense of on-the-spot anticipation for all the upcoming releases. While still recognizing their roots as a group that pulls from almost every mainstream genre — rap, hip-hop, rock, pop, electronica, indie, and funk — they capitalize on their talents as indie-pop and electronic artists.
With its upbeat start, “Shy Away” grabs the listener’s attention right away — much like they do with some of their other critically acclaimed singles like “Tear in my Heart” and “Ride.” The track deviates from the norms of Twenty One Pilots’ more moody and emotionally heavy pieces, like “Goner” and “Truce.” However, even with the more optimistic sounds, there is still the tinge of something deeper happening just under the beat.
Like many songs from their 2015 album “Blurryface,” “Shy Away” uses a synth-heavy, EDM style to create a distinct mood for the listener. The single lacks the intimate bridge that “Tear in my Heart” has, but both songs are emotionally engaging as they touch on the intimacy of relationships. According to an interview with BBC Radio 1, Tyler Joseph, the band’s frontman, wants “Shy Away” to be a life lesson for his younger brother — who is often referenced in the group's music.
One little homage to the band’s past pops up in the last repetition of the chorus. In many older Twenty One Pilots songs, there are sections where Joseph sings in a screamo style for an intense, pure emotional release. Though this song doesn’t quite lean into the variety of genres like many of their other songs might, the last chorus starts with the slightest scream of the lyrics. This little bit of fan service, although almost purely inconsequential because it’s so subtle, shows the artist’s commitment to its long-time fans.
“Shy Away” does lack some of Twenty One Pilots well-known style. While presenting an opportunity for the band to branch out, it may very well be a turn down the wrong path. What has made the band’s work so memorable is their use of thrilling music to present intimate reflections on the hardships of life. “Shy Away,” while still being catchy and enjoyable, doesn’t do the same as songs like “Stressed Out” for the group. In many ways, it’s a less distinct track unlike those that fans have come to love from Twenty One Pilots.
“Shy Away,” despite diverging from many of the other Twenty One Pilots singles, exhibits the range of a band that has clearly shown they’re capable of creating hits in almost any genre. With “Scaled and Icy” being set to release on May 21, “Shy Away” is an interesting taste of what we can expect from Twenty One Pilots this year. Let’s hope that the album doesn't deviate too far from what fans love about this incredible group.

Paloma Rocío Castillo Astorga, the 21 year-old singer professionally known as Paloma Mami, released her debut studio album “Sueños de Dalí” on March 19. Combining elements of pop, R&B, trap, and reggaeton, “Sueños” is the future of urbano music.
The Chilean-American singer was born in Manhattan and is now living in Santiago. Following the release of her hit song “Not Steady,” she became the first Chilean artist to sign under the Sony Music Latin label in 2018. Since then, Castillo has been dabbling in many genres, her singles mixing love and pain in a bilingual blend of ballad and rhythm.
That duality of culture, language, and sound is ingrained in “Sueños.”
The album begins with Castillo paying homage to her Chilean roots with “Mi Palomita.” This opening track has soulful guitar chords and rhythmic castanets that set an intimate mood. That folklore quality translates into the lyrics that speak about “Palomita,” a little dove whose singing voice brings peace and calm. That connection between Castillo’s stage name and the lullaby-like melody shows an emotional side to the singer’s upbringing by her grandfather, lending an introspective quality to the track. Similarly, the interlude “Dreams” echoes that naturalistic groove, stripping the instrumentals bare to focus on Castillo’s raw vocals as she sings about loved ones staying by her side. “I was recording it with all the insects, all the crickets, the frogs, the birds, everything around me,” revealed Castillo in an Apple Music interview, explaining the influence of nature and nurture on this song.
In the same vein of self-reflection, Castillo also embraces her romanticism and sexuality. “For Ya” and “Religiosa” dive into the singer's candid experience with falling in and out of love. In lyrics like “Lo doy todo por ti” (I would give everything for you) and “Cuando se siente así de bien soy religiosa” (when it feels this good I’m religious), love is almost a feverish devotion for Castillo. Once again, the sonics are smooth and minimalistic, often purposefully undefined to fade into the background. The clandestine lyrics and sexy melodies characterize the singer as lovesick and vulnerable, having been hurt one too many times because of that.
The deconstructed sonics on these tracks would get monotonous very quickly if not for Castillo experimenting with bold new beats.
The backing of dancehall rhythms to the rap verse in “Goteo” makes the song sound new age and novel in the context of this album, even though it has been previously released as a single. Castillo herself admitted that she wanted to “talk about how fly [she is]” on this track, and that message comes across clearly in the dominant beats that make a statement when compared to the instrumental mellowness in the rest of the album. “Que Wea” is another high-energy track that echoes that hyped up sentiment in the English rap verse: “No red light stoppin' / Everytime you see me out you know big shit poppin'.”
“RDMDA” reveals a heartbroken Castillo as she sings about “Thе wrongs that you did me,” with a hint of reworked autotune that resembles Rosalía’s neo-Spanish sound. Likewise, the harmonizing adlibs atop the booming bass in “I Love Her” bring a whole new sound to those same heartfelt emotions of “I think I love her” in the chorus, backed by funky trap beats. These intermittent complexities in the music enrich the album, diversifying the quality to the sounds while not straying away from its introspective lyricism.
The album’s artwork is perhaps the most telling symbol of the diversity of Castillo’s musical influences.
The collage-like scene features a mix of various cartoon characters on the backdrop of a deserted landscape, clustered around a photorealistic Castillo riding a dove. Like her multifaceted approach to music, the artwork features many themes: love, growth, creativity, and style. In the same way “Mami” pays homage to Latin icon Ivy Queen, the eclectic art form echoes the work of Salvador Dalí. Just like “Traumada” features both a sensitive girl who’s been traumatized by love, and a girl who doesn’t “want anything to do with love,” both of these versions of Castillo coexist in the cover. That same contrast of universality and specificity of the new school art form parallels the subjective and simultaneously relatable relationship woes in “For Ya.”
The good, the bad, and the ugly: Castillo bares it all front and center. That complex coming of age narrative in “Sueños” parallels Castillo’s own story of becoming Paloma Mami.

Director Mira Nair '79, who divides her time between three countries — her birthplace India, Uganda, and the United States — is a world-renowned independent filmmaker. Her films, produced through her company Mirabai Films, are primarily known for their multi-layered, emotionally-moving, and aesthetically-charged stories that pulsate with life. Some of her best-known works include “Salaam Bombay!", “Monsoon Wedding,” “The Namesake,” “Mississippi Masala,” and “Queen of Katwe.”
Today, Nair is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker, but she wasn’t always set on making films. In fact, Nair originally enrolled as a sociology major at Delhi University’s Miranda House, wanting to be an actor. However, when she transferred to Harvard College as a sophomore, she fell in love with the visual mediums of photography and, eventually, film, ultimately becoming a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator. As a student of cinéma verité, she began her career in documentary filmmaking. After a spate of critically acclaimed documentaries such as “India Cabaret,” which follows bar dancers in Mumbai to examine morality in Indian society, Nair transitioned into narrative filmmaking. Her debut “Salaam Bombay!", a crime drama about Mumbai’s street children, won the prestigious Caméra d'Or (Best First Film) at the Cannes Film Festival, and her diverse body of work has only continued to grow.
Although Nair’s films span geographies, cultures, and themes, a common thread is her commitment to infuse realism into the stories she tells. This realism is in large part an extension of Nair’s documentary experience. Her films, which are all broadly dramatic in nature, consistently use real locations. For example, “Queen of Katwe”, which depicts the life of chess-prodigy Phiona Mutesi who lived in Uganda’s Katwe slums, was filmed on-location in the exact same slums. Moreover, many of her actors are picked from a sea of ordinary people who have never before faced the camera. The street children in “Salaam Bombay!” were all selected from the streets of Mumbai, India to create a sense of authenticity. In fact, Nair’s eye for spotting non-actors has led to the discovery of many great talents, such as Sarita Choudhury, Tillotama Shome, and Kamini Khanna. This pursuit of filmmaking through a realistic lens further informs the use of local languages, folk music, and all the aesthetic elements in Nair’s films.
Enabled by this dose of realism, Nair’s art is also steeped in socio-political commentary. In the Golden Lion-winning film “Monsoon Wedding,” for instance, Nair and screenwriter Sabrina Dhawan use the setup of an upper-class Punjabi wedding to not just depict the mélange of modernity and tradition in 21st century India, but also to interrogate the darker issues of class divide, sexism, and the hushed-about sexual abuse inflicted by family members that quietly plague Indian society. However, the beauty of Nair’s work is that the commentary is never didactic. Instead, the inequities are woven in the film as subtly as they are practiced in real life. The exchange of hurt glances, or a throwaway comment are enough to convey the depth of the issue. On the contrary, when a character does seek to question these issues, Nair does not shy away from depicting the messiness of confrontation. For example, in “Monsoon Wedding,” when Ria finally breaks down and reveals her uncle as her molester, Nair follows the hard struggle a family faces in distancing from the uncle out of respect and dealing with society’s judgement.
Above all, however, Nair’s films stand out because of her aesthetic choices. Some of her projects, especially those produced by studios, end up with underwhelming narratives, where her authenticity seems to be compromised by the system she works within. This is definitely true for Nair’s recent BBC series “A Suitable Boy,” about India’s early years of independence, where the screenplay was severely criticized for mostly English dialogues written for Indian characters. Despite the aberrations in narrative, Nair has consistently succeeded with her transportive design. Most significantly, very much like the photographer Alex D. Webb ‘74, Nair constructs frames with an array of colours and multiple layers that capture the richness and energy of the environment, but also the emotional tension driving a scene. By extension, Nair’s choice of music, costume, and set design follow the same transportive template. While Nair is driven by many traditional and contemporary influences when making these artistic decisions, her vision would be incomplete without her long-term collaborators. This includes cinematographer Declan Quinn, production designer Stephanie Carroll, costume designer Arjun Bhasin, and producer Lydia Dean Pilcher.
In a career spanning more than 30 years, Nair has always been and continues to remain an important voice for South Asian stories on screen. And along the way, she has paved the path for many other artists like herself. Nair runs Maisha Film Lab, a non-profit film initiative for training emerging East African filmmakers in Uganda. Her achievements stand as a testament to her philosophy: “If we don’t tell our own stories, no one else will.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most companies or individuals, a dozen consecutive years of investment failure would bring about a complete rethinking of strategy, if not financial downfall.
Not so with the Harvard Management Company, which shepherds the University’s more than $40 billion endowment. HMC’s success or failure decides if the University can fund pathbreaking research, hire additional faculty in needed fields, build a long-desired student multicultural center, and even keep its lights on.
Yet this past year marked the 12th in a row in which HMC has underperformed the stock market as a whole. In other words, if Harvard were to have just placed all its disposable endowment funds into a simple passive index fund a decade ago and left it there untouched, the University would have saved close to half a billion dollars in bloated salaries for HMC executives and generated billions more in returns.
The irony is that Harvard used to be viewed as an enviable model for consistent, elevated investment returns. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Harvard’s endowment actually outpaced a traditional portfolio of U.S. stocks and bonds by as many as six percentage points a year, better than even many actively managed funds on Wall Street.
At the time, there was so much to go around that a high-level HMC executive could rake in up to $35 million in a single year.
But eventually, the luck — or perhaps short-lived skill — ran dry. The University’s success had come in large part from bets in risky industries like timber that paid off handsomely in the short-term, but ultimately could not sustain such high returns. Similar gambles on quixotic investments in more recent decades — like a massive gambit on Brazilian farmland — have proved financially (and sometimes ethically) disastrous.
Now with over a decade of clear evidence, there’s no excuse for Harvard not to give up its time-worn strategy, one in which managers act more like teenagers trying to short Gamestop than financially savvy and deliberate stewards of the world’s largest university endowment.
In 2017, apparently recognizing that its low returns required reforms, HMC outsourced some of its investment operations, after steering a mostly in-house operation for decades.
But this missed the point almost entirely, a case of shifting the seats on the Titanic without fundamentally altering the boat’s course. If anything, it may have only solidified and even exacerbated Harvard’s misguided strategy of trying to get fancy with its money, whether trading stocks or dipping into risky, alternative investments.
By outsourcing, Harvard appears to be betting that active fund managers know better. In reality, the hubris of such managers is a cause of considerable jest among many financial experts.
In 2007, Warren Buffett challenged the hedge fund industry to a $1 million bet. "Just select a set of at least five funds that match the returns over 10 years of an unmanaged, passive fund, and you’ll receive the $1 million," he said.
“After all, these managers urged others to bet billions on their abilities. Why should they fear putting a little of their own money on the line?” Buffett asked at the time.
Well, what happened? Sure enough, a confident fund manager accepted the bet and proceeded to lose so overwhelmingly that he handed over the $1 million to Buffett months early.
Harvard’s decision to actively invest is hardly unique among large universities or mega-wealthy individual investors. Slightly more than half the U.S. stock market is made up of money from actively managed funds.
But that proportion has dropped significantly over the past decade, as investors have begun to finally abandon their infatuation with hedge funds and other professional investors.
In fact, many smaller colleges — including Carthage College of Wisconsin — have already implemented pretty much this very passive strategy, with predictably positive results. In the decade spanning fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2017, encompassing the worst of the Great Recession, Carthage reported a 6.2 percent average annual return.
Harvard? Just a 4.4 percent return. That alone is literally billions in lost money.
In fact, during the financially difficult 2016 fiscal year, the smallest university endowments as a whole outperformed the largest ones, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers survey. That difference could almost be entirely explained by the large colleges’ higher use of hedge funds and other non-passive investing schemes.
In other words, these small colleges’ experiences dismantle the common argument from supporters of actively managed funds, that, “well, passive index funds work might work fine, but just watch what happens when the economy hits a rough patch!”
A shift to passive investing for the University is far from a new or radical idea. An activist group of alumni from the Class of 1969 has long called for similar reforms.
Having a passive investment strategy and divesting from fossil fuel and private prison companies are not mutually exclusive. In fact, 11 of 12 passive sustainable funds beat the standard S&P 500 index in 2020, showing a large-scale shift towards passive investing could actually help accelerate and justify a quick move away from socially deleterious investments.
Ultimately, Harvard’s current strategy may come back to donors wanting their money to feel safe and closely looked after when they write a check to the University. Just like they might make the mistake of placing their individual assets in the psychologically safe hands of an active manager, they want the University to do the same.
But it is Harvard’s responsibility to do what’s financially savvy above all else. And higher returns will surely speak loudest in the end.
This can’t be a topic broached only a few times each decade, given the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars at stake. HMC leadership should have to justify the organization’s very existence at every turn. The onus should be on them, not on activists from the Class of 1969 or others proposing a sensible path forward.
Harvard’s donors deserve it. Harvard’s faculty and staff deserve it. And Harvard’s students deserve it.
Well, what are they waiting for?

The Harvard Graduate School of Education will expand its work on diversity and inclusion through intentional hiring and planning in its summer programming, HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging Director Tracie D. Jones said in interviews with The Crimson.
As the school plans to reopen this fall, Long said the school is investing in staff keenly dedicated to diversity and inclusion.
“We need to make more progress in terms of action, and so we’ve been investing to increase our capacity, more staff focused on these issues, expertise being brought in,” Long said.
Jones said the school has hired a "senior instructional coach for anti-racist pedagogy" and is in the process of hiring more staff, including a librarian who specializes in "critical pedagogy."
Long said the remote format of work over the past year actually helped faciliate thoughtful conversations on how HGSE can improve its commitment to anti-racism.
“Some work around diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging has been easier being in a remote environment, because it allows for some to kind of slow down the conversation a bit, to be able to be thoughtful, to have multiple ways in which people can participate, whether that's speaking or writing in the chat,” she said.
“People are bringing with them their local communities, which brings in a whole new dimension of how we think about identity and how we think about diversity,” Long added.
At the same time, Jones said it is important to acknowledge that remote settings can engender segregation.
“You start to build these relationships that are actually not really diverse. And as I started talking to students, and questioning them about who was in your social circle, I realized they were self-segregating,” she said.
To address that concern, Jones said the school plans to create clear, scheduled summer programming that will give students an opportunity to connect with other students ahead of their programs’ start dates.
After a year of online programming, Jones said some of the office’s traditional programming will likely stay online, citing expanded opportunities for guest speakers who would not otherwise be able to travel to Harvard's campus.
“The benefit of that is seeing real-time action and hearing from people who are actually doing the work, as opposed to talking about the work that they want to do or they plan to do,” she said.
Online programming will also allow students continuing their learning part-time to participate in their courses, per Jones.
The school’s diversity and inclusion work will also extend to the redesign of the Master’s of Education program. The forthcoming change, announced in February, places a heavier emphasis on foundational knowledge in education before concentrating in specialized training.
“In the master’s redesign, we put into that [redesign] competencies around diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging for our students,” Long said.
Jones said the redesign will enable the school to collect data regarding diversity and inclusion in the master's program so that it can work to improve upon those efforts for every new cohort of students.
HGSE students are also in the process of creating two library guides to spread knowledge about the experiences of racial minority groups. One of the guides centers on the experience of Black people during Covid-19, and the other focuses on Asian American activism through art, according to Jones.
“A lot of our students are going out into the community — so in the schools, the K-12 schools — to get young people to contribute,” she said. “I think that’s a good way of building community, but also utilizing our resources and making them open-source.”

Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53 is widely known on campus as the default example of a conservative faculty member at Harvard.
According to Mansfield, this is not because his views possess any sort of “superiority” to others’ perspectives, but simply because a professor with his political stance is “rare” on Harvard’s campus.
“Every class you enter, you have to work out your position vis-à-vis what the professor is saying,” Mansfield said. “Because a professor is going to be a liberal, and he’s not going to be bashful about it.”
“There are many more conservatives among the students than there are among either the faculty or the administration,” he said, adding that those students tend to seek him out as one of the few vocal conservative voices in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
It is no surprise that Harvard’s faculty skews heavily toward the left side of the political aisle. Out of 236 members of the FAS who responded to a question on political leanings in The Crimson’s 2021 Faculty Survey, just seven — 3 percent — identified as “somewhat” or “very conservative,” compared to 183 who identified as “somewhat” or “very liberal.”
Political donations by FAS members show a similar leftward bent. Contributions by FAS faculty to Democrats recorded in the publicly available Federal Election Commission filings for 2017-2020 totaled $744,143, while donations to Republican campaigns and candidates amounted to just $3,010, less than the $5,600 that FAS faculty contributed to independent candidates.
Harvard is no outlier in this regard, though. The conservative representation on Yale’s faculty just barely exceeded Harvard’s in a 2017 Yale Daily News survey. Of the 314 respondents, only 7 percent of faculty identified as conservative.
Computer Science professor emeritus Harry R. Lewis ’68, dean of Harvard College from 1995 to 2003, said the leftward lean of academia may stem from its goal of advancing new and sometimes radical ideas, rather than maintaining the status quo.
“The best thing you can possibly say about a professor is ‘she changed the way everybody thinks about this field,’” he said. “It’s almost by definition anti-preservationist because we place such a high value on the creation of new knowledge.”
While the University has made a concerted effort across the past decade to promote gender and racial diversity among its faculty, Harvard has not made any explicit attempts to bolster representation from across the ideological spectrum.
The overwhelming majority of faculty on campuses nationwide have long fallen on the left of the political center. In a 2018 article for the right-leaning nonprofit advocacy group National Association of Scholars, economist Mitchell Langbert concluded that, excluding the two military colleges, the ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans among faculty at liberal arts colleges is 12.7 to 1.
Lewis said the political leanings of faculty generally matter more in the social sciences, while his sense is that in the hard sciences the politics of faculty members are less likely to play a role in their work.
“In the hard sciences, I generally have no idea what my colleagues’ politics are since it has zero impact on their scholarship,” he said. “If you’re in economics, or in political science, or in sociology, probably people’s political views are closer to the surface.”
Government professor Ryan D. Enos disagreed with Lewis, asserting that politics can infuse into all disciplines, even if it appears apolitical at the time.
“We may look around now and say people are just doing science, which of course a lot of people in the social sciences say they are too, but it may not be evident to us at the time that what we’re doing is highly politicized,” Enos said.
Enos added that Harvard faculty across all disciplines would be more likely to have “pretty intense” political views than the average American, since political involvement is highly correlated with education.
In an emailed statement, former University President Lawrence H. Summers wrote that he believes academia is naturally more “progressive” because professors are choosing to forego more lucrative job opportunities.
“People who don’t like capitalism tend to gravitate to academia because they don’t like working for companies, whereas people who like capitalism have many more choices,” Summers wrote.
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw has faced student criticism for his right-leaning political views. In November 2011, students staged a walkout in his Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” class over its perceived conservative bent.
Mankiw, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush but left the Republican Party in 2019, said he believes the Economics department is “more diverse” politically than the overall faculty body. In his experience, the climate for center-right faculty members at Harvard has been “extremely polite," he said.
In one instance, however, he said a faculty member in the sciences approached him after hearing he was a Republican and acted as though it were “some very strange character flaw.”
“There’s no overt antagonism — there’s sort of latent skepticism of people who have different political views,” Mankiw said. “A lot of the faculty don’t interact with people right of center on a regular basis, and so I think there’s probably a lack of understanding.”
Robert J. Barro, a colleague of Mankiw’s in the Economics department whose research has been critical of government spending, indicated that he has not always experienced the same mutual toleration.
Though he said most of his colleagues in Economics are “very open to different points of view,” Barro noted many faculty are no longer willing to consider conservative viewpoints on certain political issues, such as affirmative action hiring policies for faculty.
“There’s no tolerance at all at this point for something that says we should just be hiring on the basis of merit in terms of scholarship, teaching ability, and so on,” he said. “It’s sort of no question now that, in addition to that, you’re supposed to be heavily weighting various forms of identity.”
Enos — who received national attention for calling on Harvard to adopt “minimum standards” for affiliation following the Capitol riot — agreed with Barro, noting that his own views are “in line with most Harvard faculty,” but that it is “pretty apparent” many professors are not welcoming to views that fall on the opposite side of the political aisle on issues like affirmative action.
“People would be willing to engage in a discussion, but I think that there would be an underlying premise that those views are invalid, and maybe even offensive,” Enos said. “We often treat those [issues like affirmative action] and discussions around Harvard, including discussions among faculty, as only having one correct side of the issue.”
Mansfield said he has had “all kinds of trouble” with some of his colleagues.
“They believe they are scientist[s] — scientists are objective, it doesn’t matter what party you belong to,” he said. “And the fact that all of them belong to the Democratic Party is a mere accident of no interest or importance.”
But while tenured professors might be more comfortable sharing their political views with impunity, Mankiw acknowledged that tenure-track professors likely do not share the same level of comfort.
“If I were a right-of-center untenured professor, I probably would not advertise my views,” Mankiw said. “You should recognize you’re in the minority, and not everybody’s going to judge you with open-mindedness.”
Summers, who has in the past criticized the “great deal of absurd political correctness” on Harvard’s campus, noted he believes it is important for the University to increase the ideological diversity of the faculty.
“While my views are progressive, I am struck that universities have unfortunately not devoted nearly the same level of effort to diversity of ideas as they have to demographic diversity and to maintaining a culture where those with conservative views on issues like affirmative action, the military or property rights are made to feel welcome,” Summers wrote.
Though they have advocated for academic freedom and free speech on campus, neither of Summers’s successors — Drew G. Faust and Lawrence S. Bacow — has publicly voiced support for more politically diverse hiring.
Mansfield argued that the only path to balance the current disparity must be a concerted effort by the administration to hire more conservative scholars in inherently political fields.
“What we need is more conservative faculty appointments,” Mansfield said. “There hasn’t been a conservative appointed as a Harvard faculty for the last 10 years, as far as I know.”
But only a minority of surveyed faculty support an intentional effort to bolster conservative representation among the FAS, according to The Crimson’s February survey.
Out of 238 respondents, only 23 percent said they “somewhat” or “strongly support” attempts to increase political diversity among the faculty, while 34 percent said they “somewhat” or “strongly oppose” hiring more conservative professors. Forty-three percent said they “neither support nor oppose” doing so.
In addition, 34 percent of surveyed faculty supported completely barring former members of the Trump administration from appointments to the FAS, though they may not necessarily oppose hiring ideological conservatives not directly affiliated with Trump.
“The administration is not looking for conservatives,” Mansfield said. “If it wanted to, it could find them — they’re easy to find. There aren’t a whole lot of them, but there are definitely enough if you’re looking.”
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on Mansfield’s assertions.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky pushed back against Mansfield, saying he believes the University does not take into account the political views of potential hirees.
“I don’t think that we, at least in political science, pay as much attention to people’s politics as people think,” Levitsky said. “You can’t tell someone’s politics from their dissertation or their journal article.”
Levitsky added that he thinks “more than a small handful” of professors in the Government department are conservative or libertarian.
Government professor Jennifer L. Hochschild, who previously served as chair of the department, fell more on Levitsky’s side, arguing that the most important qualification for hiring should be scholarship.
“We fall back on the traditional things we’ve always fallen back on — the importance of the work, the big ideas, the evaluations of colleagues at other universities,” she said.
Hochschild maintained she was “skeptical of the whole concern” about diminishing numbers of conservative faculty on campus, arguing that the leftward lean of academia is a “very old trope.”
She said she does not support compensating for a dearth of conservative faculty members by hiring on an ideological basis, though she noted that one tactic could be hiring in certain fields that have a propensity for greater diversity of thought.
“I could imagine identifying fields where you might plausibly expect some of the best scholars to have a wider range of viewpoints than in other fields, and that seems to be an appropriate strategy for thinking about getting diversity,” she said, offering military policy as an example of a discipline that may have a greater supply of center-right scholars to potentially hire.
In contrast, Yiddish Literature and Comparative Literature professor emeritus Ruth R. Wisse said a commitment to diverse hiring must include ideological diversity.
“Diversity is diversity of thought,” she said, adding that she was appointed in 1993, before the University began more strongly considering identity in hiring.
“No one asked me these questions because they weren’t yet in the air,” she said. “But five years later, anyone who held my belief would not have been appointed.”
“Anybody who was appointed on the basis of this new value system is of course going to uphold this new value system,” Wisse added, regarding affirmative action in hiring policies.
Wisse said that though potential hirees are not often asked their political views outright, she believes potential candidates can sometimes be “blackballed” when faculty committees “sniff out their political views.”
Historian Niall C. Ferguson, who left the University in 2016 to join the Hoover Institution at Stanford, wrote in an emailed statement that he believes the number of right-of-center professors at Harvard is diminishing.
“It became increasingly apparent over my 12 years at Harvard that conservative professors were not just a small minority but an endangered species that might go extinct,” he wrote. “The skew to the left amongst faculty (and administrators) is now greater than ever and academia should not be politically monochrome.”
Ferguson added he believes Harvard would “benefit from having something like the Hoover Institution” to help balance out the “unprecedented skew to the left.” The Hoover Institution, where Ferguson currently serves as a senior fellow, is a right-of-center think tank housed within Stanford.
Barro also said he is not optimistic about the future of political discourse among faculty and students on campus.
“It looks like it’s just getting worse,” he said. “What’s true for the University is true in a larger dimension with respect to the broader society and politics.”
Barro noted that one way the administration could alleviate the tension is by continuing to voice support for free speech on campus.
“They should be continually affirming that the most important thing is freedom of expression and freedom of thought, freedom of speech,” he said. “That’s not what the administration seems to be doing — they seem to be more pushing to do things that make people comfortable and don’t raise certain objectionable points of view.”
In an email, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton referred to previous statements by Bacow about the importance of free speech, including an address to the FAS at a February faculty meeting.
“History teaches us the dangers of campus bans and litmus tests based on ideology. The defense of free and honest inquiry in the unfettered pursuit of truth is our shared responsibility—and among our most sacred commitments,” Bacow said during the meeting.
Dane, the FAS spokesperson, pointed to the University’s free speech guidelines, formulated in 1990, which reiterate the importance of “rational discourse” and “free interchange of ideas.”
“Because we are a community committed to rational processes, we do not permit censorship of noxious ideas,” the guidelines read.
Last October, the FAS permitted Government preceptor David D. Kane to invite highly controversial social scientist Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak at a virtual event. FAS Dean Claudine Gay noted at the time that though she does not believe Murray’s work has academic merit, she is committed to maintaining academic freedom.
Levitsky described that in his experience in the Government department, older professors tend to be more open to the principle of maintaining few limitations on campus speech.
“Most of the folks 45 years and up in my department are old school in terms of speech, libertarian market of ideas,” he said.
When asked whether departments seem to be moving in a more leftward direction as older professors retire, Enos replied that “it certainly seems that the trends are pushing that direction.”
“Imagine a place is known to be filled with 90 percent liberals, for example,” he said. “If you were a conservative professor, would you feel comfortable going and joining the faculty there?”
Enos said he believes the worsening ideological imbalance is a “real problem.”
“When places are perfectly homogenous, they do a lot of things that are undesirable — they collapse into tribalism, they don’t check their own ideas,” he said. “We may look around one day and realize we have, for example, at Harvard a department that studies politics where everybody has exactly the same views on politics, and that can’t be healthy for our scholarship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass) discussed racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19 and her overarching legislative priorities as part of Harvard School of Public Health’s “Voices in Leadership During Crises” series on Thursday.
Pressley, the first woman of color to be elected to Congress from Massachusetts, was joined in conversation by moderators Michelle A. Williams, dean of the School of Public Health, and Jeffrey Sánchez, an HSPH lecturer and former Massachusetts state representative.
Pressley, who represents the 7th congressional district of Massachusetts, including parts of Harvard’s campus, said her district is one of the most federally under-resourced in the country due to lack of census accuracy. She said the pandemic worsened inequities in healthcare access already present among her constituents.
“The Massachusetts seventh was the hardest hit by the pandemic, which we knew would be the case anecdotally. In a three-mile radius in my district from Cambridge to Roxbury, life expectancy drops by 30 years — and we know the coronavirus has contributed to that significantly,” she said.
During the event, Sánchez highlighted the disproportionate toll the coronavirus has taken on communities of color in Massachusetts.
Pressley added that the devastating toll has been fueled by disparities in access to care and to treatments. She said “vaccine redlining” has blocked many in communities of color from receiving the Covid-19 vaccines.
Pressley said she is working to combat these inequities with the Anti-Racism in Public Health Act, which she recently introduced in Congress alongside Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Representative Barbara J. Lee (D-Ca.).
“Throughout this, we’ve been elevating my practice of ‘policy is my love language’ — well, policies that seek to mitigate the harm caused by anti-Black and racist policies is really my love language, and that’s what the Anti-Racism in Public Health Act would do,” Pressley said. “This is going to confront and dismantle racist systems and practices that have created the inequities that you enumerated and that we see in the Massachusetts seventh every day.”
Pressley futher discussed her approach to policy-making and combating disparities. Pressley said she believes those “closest to the pain must be closest to the power,” and cited her experience enduring the incarceration of both her father and her husband as shaping her perspective on criminal justice reform.
In order to prevent the over-policing of “survival behavior” like substance use in minority communities, Pressley said she plans to make mental health, poverty, and homelessness policy priorities.
Pressley said these initiatives will help address the social determinants of community-based violence, and praised President Joe Biden’s recent executive action on gun reform.
“We have to organize and legislate like lives depend on it, because they do,” Pressley said. “If we can legislate hurt and harm, then I do believe that we can legislate healing, that we can legislate equity, that we can legislate justice.”
Organization, mobilization, and democratic action will be driving forces in enacting these legislative priorities, according to Pressley. She added that she hopes her colleagues in Congress will “see the light” on some of these issues.
“If they don’t see the light, then we will bring the fire,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a wave of rising anti-Asian violence, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a Wednesday interview that Harvard aims to “pursue durable change” in diversifying its faculty and fostering an inclusive climate.
After a 21-year-old gunman killed eight people — including six Asian women — at three Atlanta-area spas last month, Gay and other administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, condemned the rise in anti-Asian violence in a series of emails.
In his message, Bacow instructed Harvard affiliates to contact the University’s police force if they have knowledge of a “racist attack.” A dozen Harvard student organizations signed a letter criticizing Bacow for the suggestion, calling it an “unacceptable and harmful remedy” for anti-Asian violence at the University.
Gay said during the interview that in addition to the Harvard University Police Department, students who wish to report instances of hate and discrimination can turn to “a number of supports” within the College, including resident deans and “faculty members they trust and feel supported by.”
“We stand and must stand in solidarity with members of the AAPI community here at Harvard, but also really across the nation,“ Gay said. “I do believe very strongly that this is a struggle that belongs to all of us, and that we have a role to play, in particular, in fighting the false narratives that drive racist violence.”
Gay additionally called upon all Harvard affiliates to do their part to help create a climate of acceptance and support.
“One of the things that I feel is an important expression and manifestation of this idea of a shared struggle is that we want to build a community in which all of us feel like we can be not only agents of change, but also support for members of the community in times of challenge and need,” she said. “That’s the kind of place that I want Harvard to be.”
Reflecting on the past year, Gay said that Harvard — as well as the world more broadly — has received a wake-up call to the “issues of inequality, systemic racism, bias, prejudice, white supremacy, in ways never seen before.” She said she plans to “take this moment and use it to pursue durable change” by expanding and diversifying the FAS curriculum.
“It provides even stronger motivation for us to pursue and succeed at our efforts to expand our curriculum, and more fully and robustly represent in our curriculum the diverse histories and experiences that are so formative to who we are as a society,” she said.
Following an announcement last August that she would create two annual visiting professorships in ethnic studies, Gay shared that she has now extended offers for the inaugural cohort to “two leading scholars of race and ethnicity,” and she hopes to announce their appointments soon.
While she declined to comment on specifics of the separate cluster hire of three to four tenured ethnic studies faculty, Gay said the search “continues to move forward.” During an interview in March, Gay said she remains “excited and optimistic” about welcoming the new senior faculty “hopefully in the coming year.”
In the Wednesday interview, Gay said the FAS is firmly committed to carrying out the “important work” of addressing questions of race, diversity, and inequality.
“Harvard can really deliver on our institutional commitment to truth and advancement of knowledge in ways that make the world a better, more humane, and more just place,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard boasts the largest endowment of any university in the world and supplements its finances with hundreds of millions of dollars in donations annually. Despite the scale of Harvard’s philanthropic efforts, a sizable gender disparity persists among the University’s donors.
In the fiscal year 2020, 338 individuals, families, foundations, organizations, governments, and other entities donated more than $1 million to Harvard, according to the University’s “Report of Giving” released earlier this year.
Eight of them were individual women. They include four Harvard alumni, financial services executives, philanthropists, a former delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and the Chief Operating Officer at Facebook.
The other donors include 51 individual men, 47 nonprofits or foundations, eight corporations, 109 couples or families, 13 trusts and estates, and the United Arab Emirates. There were also 101 anonymous donors.
But despite encompassing a small fraction of the listed donors, experts say the fact that women are on the list at all reflects shifting gender dynamics and attitudes around money and high-level philanthropy.
The donors — K. Lisa Yang, Elaine M. Schuster, Cynthia M. Godsoe ’93, Gillian Gray, Nancy Lurie Marks, Catherine James Paglia, Emily Rauh Pulitzer, and Sheryl Sandberg ’91 — all declined to comment on the nature of their giving.
Linda Durant, former Vice President of Development for the Council for Advancement and Support of Education who is now a Laureate at the organization, said a decade ago, women would likely not have cracked the top donor roll.
Rather, Durant said large-dollar donations were primarily undertaken by married couples and their estates. She noted that many women have made significant strides in business and technology in recent years, increasing the number of female billionaires.
“Ten years ago it was mostly you focused on the couples, and you didn’t really see that many female billionaires, and now they're much more prevalent,” Durant said. “There's so many more entrepreneurs, and these women are in their own right, making their own statements about philanthropy.”
Debra Mesch, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, said an increasing number of women are the primary earners in their family, contributing to the increase in women-initiated gifts.
“Women are starting to out-earn their spouse,” Mesch said. “It used to be 20 years ago that [it] was a very small number.”
Mesch also said that the number of individual female donors may, in fact, be higher than it seems. Studies show women are more likely than male donors to remain anonymous in their giving, according to Mesch.
“Women in the past have been more hesitant about identifying themselves,” Mesch said. “Women tend to give more anonymously, they are less concerned about putting their names on buildings.”
Martha A. Taylor, co-founder of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute and former Vice President at the University of Wisconsin Foundation, also said she believes most anonymous donors of colleges and universities are women.
For joint gifts, it is harder to distinguish who was the primary giver, or who Mesch calls the “gas pedal” behind the donation, she said.
“You see a lot of couples where maybe the woman is the primary wealth holder, but the couple is jointly giving that so sometimes you don’t really know, in the household, if it’s the woman that’s pushing that gift, or if it’s the spouse that's pushing that gift,” Mesch said.
Una O. Osili ’94, a professor of economics and philanthropic studies at Indiana University, said there are a growing number of households in which women have great influence and are behind the push for joint charitable giving.
“We call those sort of the women-influenced households; [they] have a higher likelihood of giving and they give more,” Osili said. “That’s showing that even in the couple environment in the household setting, where women are at the table, in terms of decision making, there is more allocated in terms of funds to charitable causes; both the likelihood and the dollar amount.”
Mesch also said women may elect to give less to a greater number of organizations, compared with many male donors.
“Women’s giving patterns are, ‘I’m going to give here, I’m going to give here, I’m going to give here,’ and they spread out their giving across a large number of organizations where men tend to focus on a fewer number, more focused number of organizations,” Mesch said.
Mesch said this perception can cause institutions and schools to focus less on attracting female donors, under the mistaken assumption that women donate less.
Some of Harvard’s peer institutions have organized fundraising campaigns around the idea of recruiting women into giving circles. Dartmouth College launched “The Call To Lead Campaign” in 2018 in the hopes of securing seven-figure donations from one hundred women.
Durant said Dartmouth’s campaign serves as an example for other institutions seeking to include more women in their capital campaigns.
“It was a very specific campaign for women,” Durant said. “It proved that Dartmouth understood and knew that these women were able to give, wanted to give, and that they just had to really focus in and talk to them and find out what it is that they were willing to give to versus locking them in with the entire campaign.”
But some say that directed initiatives are unnecessary, and may risk falling back on gendered cliches.
Jeannie Bachelor Lavine ’88, who donated with her husband Jonathan S. Lavine, wrote in an email that she believes women should not be approached differently in fundraising campaigns.
Lavine also wrote that her contributions to the University were motivated by her family’s long-standing connection to Harvard.
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessey declined to comment on Harvard’s efforts to attract female donors.
“Harvard depends on the generosity of alumni and donors who support the university’s mission at all levels and enable the university to have a lasting impact in areas of teaching, learning, research and innovation,” Hennessy wrote in an emailed statement.
Deni T. Elliott, a professor of journalism and digital communication at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg, said she believes institutions of higher education should strengthen their efforts to engage female affiliates, given their increasing financial power.
“Women provide a largely untapped resource, and that they [university development offices] need to engage women, not only in money coming into the institutions, but now they need to engage women in all sorts of leadership positions,” Elliott said.
Taylor, the co-founder of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute, acknowledged that female representation in higher education has improved.
“I think development officers are one hundred percent better than when I started in 1975, in that they felt that the women didn’t even have a say in the giving, and they would just ask the man for his interest,” Taylor said. “Women have made a huge stride related to philanthropy in higher ed.”
“But it still lingers out there, the fact that we’re not asking women for what they’re interested in,” Taylor added.
CORRECTION: April 12, 2021
A previous version of this article identified Linda Durant as the Vice President of Development at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. In fact, she formerly served in that role and now works as a Laureate for the organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The deputy White House climate advisor discussed how the Biden administration will tackle climate change during one of the administration's first speaking engagements on climate change this year in a webinar hosted by the Student Climate Conference at Harvard.
The event, entitled “Climate Action in Biden’s First 100 Days,” included opening remarks from Ali A. Zaidi ’08, the deputy White House national climate advisor, and a panel with Jacqueline Patterson, the senior director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program, and Alex O’Keefe, the creative director at the Sunrise Movement. Los Angeles Times journalist Rosanna Xia moderated the discussions.
Zaidi explained that his office is part of a greater national climate task force, which is composed of 20 different government agencies working together.
“It is a structure that recognizes the intersectionality of climate change, and is built to take full advantage of that in driving solutions that are really comprehensive,” he said.
Zaidi said he and his colleagues strive not only to prepare the nation for responding to disasters, but also to address more regular and persistent climate concerns he believes are often underestimated. Zaidi cited workers and incarcerated people without access to proper protection from rising temperatures.
“What we often don’t talk about is the people who are poor, who don’t have access to air conditioning as heat stress becomes a bigger deal in cities, and they can’t do anything about it, and no one's helping them,” said Zaidi. “So I think part of it is thinking about the resilience of the systems and the people and the extremes that aren’t as visible.”
While Zaidi spoke about the administration’s efforts on a national scale, Patterson and O’Keefe focused their comments on grassroots efforts to turn enthusiasm around combating climate change into tangible actions, particularly ones that aid disadvantaged populations.
O’Keefe noted the importance of earning public trust.
“The issues I’m most concerned about are the issues that will build greater political will and public buy-in,” O’Keefe said. “I don’t want this era of green transition to be marked by tax breaks and grants and things that people can’t see.”
Stephen K. Snider, the conference communications manager and one of the event’s primary organizers, said the event aimed to create a discussion about the Biden administration’s actions regarding climate change and to spark conversation among Harvard affiliates ahead of Earth Day on April 22. He added he is proud the organization comprises affiliates from across the University rather than involving only one school.
“We’re not just talking about climate change for the graduate school or for the business school or for the law school,” he said. “We’re talking about it holistically and that’s all we have to do for climate change in general. We can’t talk about this global issue in a very small, siloed way.”

Let’s talk about The League — and, for the first time since we came to college, NOT the Ivy League. Sad I know, but this might be refreshing. We’ll define The League today as an interesting spinoff of Tinder overwhelmed by a strange tsunami of pretentiousness. To start, all League users are verified, at minimum, on LinkedIn. To make things worse—but also better?—the app emphasizes that it preferentially accepts (that’s right, you must apply and be accepted to even get in on the action!) successful, highly educated individuals. Kind of gross, right? But as students at the world’s greatest and most elitist institution, of course we’re naturally intrigued. Luckily for me (and hopefully for you too), The League’s application “reviewers” deemed my profile acceptable, and now we have access to this treasure trove of “quality” potential matches. Time to take a look into what I’ve learned — and also what I wished I’d hadn’t — in the last few weeks on the Harvard of dating apps.
Is it 2007? Who designed this platform?
From the very beginning, in the app’s loading screen, pretentiousness levels are at their maximum with the intro slogan reading “loading potential soulmates”.
 Maybe it’s a result of overconfidence on their part, or maybe I just expect too much from people, but I’m anticipating an earthshattering online dating experience complete with the world’s most well designed platform. But alas,, the design of this app is straight out of the early 2000s before techie things became sleek, satisfying, and user friendly. Sure, the League might pride itself on its overwhelming array of opportunities for users to connect, but that doesn’t mean I want a million turquoise and literal 50 shades of grey tabs to navigate. On the subject of color scheme, I’m not a fan of when I receive my new daily batch of 3 to 5 men at 5 p.m., each of their cover photos has been filtered with grayscale by design of the app. I get the League is trying to make this mysterious and classy, but I’d rather just assess each of these individual’s best features in full color. Thanks.
Yawn, I’m waiting...
As I assume all non-League users are, I’m used to the opportunity for fast-paced, zero-thought swiping with the potential for a bajillion matches.
 That’s not what the League is about: we’re in the League for “relationships,” whether they’re romantic or platonic. With all these highly successful people being thrown in our faces every night, it’s no wonder they only give us a few options at a time — they don’t want to overwhelm us with each others’ greatness. The only problem, for the majority of us overly secure Harvard kids with too much confidence, the pace can get a little slow. To get into Harvard in the first place, I’m sure many of us would have passed the Stanford marshmallow test for delayed gratification, but I like matches and I always want more, ASAP. In addition to this glacial pace of potential matches, it seems the matches themselves are not fast movers. I mean when you’re saving lives or staring at numbers all day long, it makes sense that you might not be a speed texter. If you’re the successful baddie your profile says you are, by all means, please only answer my messages once a day, but I might be married by the time we discuss your favorite color.
So who’s really on here? 
I can’t lie, all the chaps I’ve come upon in the past couple weeks have impressive credentials. Whether they’re at Harvard Med or BCG, the majority seem to have stable lives and bright futures. But, as I’ve just implied through their current career choices, a lot of my “potential soulmates” are hella old… With the age rage set from 20 to 28 (I’m really trying to scope out the field for you all), the majority of men I’ve matched with are in the 23 to 26 range. Maybe I’m just too young to be here? I’d say attractiveness averages slightly higher than Tinder, but also more radiating douchebag vibes. On the other hand, we do have some smart and helpful lads. One of my matches in particular, an attractive enough current 1st year resident at HMS, has messaged me incredible advice on my premed journey. Who needs premed tutors and OCS when you have these men in the League? Harvard might need to consider lowering tuition costs factoring in this new and free advising resource. And, if you’re looking for some pointers in your specific area of interest, I’m confident the array of analysts, consultants, and various grad students can supply exactly what you’re looking for.
But I want to know who’s liked me!
Oh, but you can! Out of the many many tabs on this app, one will show you the users who have already hearted your profile. This takes away some of the surprise of matching with someone, but it’s still fun to know! Unfortunately, only those who pay the RIDICULOUS member fee (ex. $300 for three months) have access to this spicy info. Or at least that’s what the League wants you to think. When navigating from tab to tab to the “Likes You” tab, there is a fraction of a second in which likers are not blocked out by the app asking for your life savings in exchange for the ability to view this feature. If you’re fast—and I know all Harvard zoomers are—you can take a screenshot and peek at your most recent likers. You’d think the League would understand the intelligence of its user base a little more extensively and somehow disable this loophole… so shhh we’re not going to tell and we’re going to keep finessing as we’ve all been doing since day one.
BEWARE of crossover! Like, seriously
If I’ve sold you on applying already, I’m surprised, but great! However, if you are an occasional Bumble/Tinder user, I would like for you to enjoy this short anecdote before you start the journey of applying, being accepted, and screenshotting to see those likers. Speed Tinder swiping with your friends at 11:43 p.m. can be a bop, and sometimes someone tolerably attractive pops up, so you swipe right. You match. They message you. They actually want to go on a date? They don’t seem creepy, plus they’re from a Harvard grad school, so what could go wrong on an outside coffee date when you’re both regularly tested for COVID? It actually goes well! You start “seeing” each other… until they abruptly end it? Cue: I’m a little lost but fair enough. Time to jump back into the ~action~! Enter: the League. Imagine, you’re hearting and exing away, taking those screenshots, seeing your likers, and SUDDENLY your latest screenshot reveals not only did this ex-man from Tinder have the nerve to end it with you in the first place but also has the AUDACITY to heart you ON A NEW PLATFORM VERY RECENTLY? Is this what stalker behavior looks like? It was a little scarring— or, at least, I would imagine it to be, considering this is a hypothetical story, of course. So again, I warn, buyer BEWARE.
Overall, this was quite a transformative experience, and I hope these League insights will help guide you on your dating journey. Until we get back to Mather JCR or actually meeting people organically in person at all, the League might be a fun way to add some spice to your life! Have fun, be COVID safe, and find yourself some potential soulmates!

As an international student, I am constantly baffled by some of America’s more unique attributes. I’m always asking questions like, why is a dime smaller than a penny? What is the electoral college? Why are there only three feet in a yard, but 12 inches in a foot? Honestly, why so persistent on the imperial system? However, since the pandemic hit, those studying from home are faced with another set of challenges: time difference. I’ll take you along my day in Tokyo (13 hours ahead of Cambridge time) but virtually, keeping up with the hype nowadays.
6:00 p.m.: Good morning/evening! After some good day’s sleep, I wake up to see the evening gaze and a plateful of dinner.
12:30 a.m.: Classes finally begin! I sustain my urge to dive into bed with my fluffy pajamas and fire up Zoom. Cue the awkward introductions in breakout rooms which always end up with me saying “It’s midnight where I am” and the other person responding “I don’t know how you do that.”
2:00 a.m.: Still class time while staring through the pitch black skies and listening to my dad’s blaring snores.
4:45 a.m.: Finally done with classes! A quick lunch break!
6:00 a.m.: As I work on my problem set, I notice that the sun is coming up. I might fire up some Youtube workout videos but with caution not to wake up my parents who are still fast asleep.
8:30 a.m.: Breakfast? Dinner? Food time! My parents call it a breakfast, but to me, it’s my third meal of the day.
9:30 a.m.: Starting to get sleepy, but heading to class with my third cup of coffee in hand.
12:00 p.m.: Getting ready to go to bed, but simultaneously running errands. Who wouldn’t want to get groceries right before bed?
2:00 p.m.: Although sunlight is now shining through my blinds, it’s time for me to go to bed. Good night/afternoon! Zzz…
My day boils down to having a lot of coffee, writing to people that I can’t go to meetings because of time difference (although I’m probably awake), and complaining to strangers in random Zoom breakout rooms. A silver lining to this nocturnal schedule is that I am not a plant — I don’t need photosynthesis to produce glucose and sustain myself. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to having class when the sun is also up. Then, not sleeping in and making it to my 9 a.m. will be the only thing I need to worry about!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Episode 3 of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham try to understand what makes a diversity review successful — and what, exactly, defines success — by looking at the most important diversity review at Harvard from recent years. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.
“Under Review” is produced by Zing Gee, Thomas Maisonneuve, and Lara F. Dada. Music by Ian Chan. Art by Meera S. Nair.
