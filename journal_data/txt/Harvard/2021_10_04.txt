After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is it that makes traveling by rail so romantic? It’s hard to picture such an experience without entering a reverie of frosted windows, those thin pieces of glass the only barriers between a passenger and primitive mountain ranges; the spectacle-wearing, newspaper-reading men who somehow make the daily news feel personal; and the warmth of coffee served by a gentle, seemingly all-knowing waiter, enjoyed amid the stillness of it all. There’s the quiet hush of conversation, made just incomprehensible beneath the steady rolling of the wheels; the unobtrusive, faint music that adds to the tender melancholy of the entire experience. Did we all watch “The Polar Express” too many times growing up, or is there indeed something to this slow-moving mode of travel that is undeniably enchanting?
Undoubtedly, it would be faster to travel by plane instead of train. While standing in the TSA line, a person could be productive and scan a few quick articles from different publications on Apple News instead of limiting themselves to a single, not to mention time-intensive, newspaper. Furthermore, it’s admittedly more convenient to pre-order coffee on a mobile app, bypassing the need to waste moments on communicating an in-person order and risk a delayed arrival at the gate. By the time our airport traveler sits in front of the windows exposing the concrete sea of tarmac, he’ll have read the news, drank his coffee, and be left with time to dive into the all-important world within his computer until it comes time to board. And if he faces a wall of boredom, the option stands to tap into his Instagram feed for a quick dopamine rush. Distraction is only ever so far away in our modern world; much easier to reach than enchantment.
Two such travelers may be heading towards the same destination, yet their experience of the journey is drastically different. Each decision of our airport traveler makes logical sense in terms of efficiency. The question, instead, is if efficiency and ease were ever worthy goals for our lives.
Sped up as we are in many aspects of our modern society, this metaphor between travelers is one that begins to define a disturbing majority of our days. From our gradual replacement of bookstores with Kindles to our preference for the convenience of Amazon Prime over small businesses, it seems we’ve reached the point where we must ask ourselves if we’ve given up too many of life’s meaningful moments for the sake of efficiency and productivity. Was it worth trading away life’s allure in the effort to speed it all up?
In defending his decision to forgo the materialism and inconsequential pitter-patter of society for a deliberate life in the woods, Henry David Thoreau expressed a fear that had he not left, he might realize he had gone through all of life without taking time to live. I imagine there is suffocating gravity in such a fear realized.
“I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear,” he philosophizes. “I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, ... to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience ...” He makes a worthy point here: Life need not be easy nor convenient for a person to be better off for having experienced it.
With convenience has come boredom, and an abundance of leisure time we spend online as a distraction. It’s in the recognition that there is inherent, intangible worth in slowing down that life has the chance to woo us once again. This, however, comes only to the person able to realize meaning cannot be pulled from convenience. To “suck the marrow out of life,” as Thoreau puts it, takes the sacrifice of our favorite distractions, a conscious step away from comfort and a legitimate commitment to interacting with the world as it stands in front of each of us. Perhaps, though, the work it would take is worth it.
With that, I encourage you to take life’s trains when they present themselves — if there is one truth in the end, it’s that regardless of what we do until we get there, we’re all heading to the same destination. Whether you interact with the world around you by taking the train or simply rush onto the plane, however, is up to you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m a sophomore now, which means I can offer unsolicited advice to freshmen, and they have to take it because they just don’t know any better.
Due to my charming personality and the various “mentorship” roles I fill within different organizations, freshmen often come up to me brimming with questions of how to spend their time at Harvard “right”: What clubs do I join? What classes do I take? How do I decide what I’m going to pursue at Harvard?
To all these questions, my answer is the same: Only do things you really love. Only commit to student organizations and research positions and club sports if they either bring you immense joy, or are in service of something that brings you immense joy. If your first thought before an extracurricular meeting is, “God, I really don’t want to go to this,” followed by, “I’m never going to use any of this in my life,” drop it.
This is not high school part two. There is no college admissions committee part two who you need to impress by becoming president of a consulting organization while juggling cancer research and volunteer work at the local soup kitchen. You do not need to fill your time with activities you hate to pad a resume or impress interviewers. I guarantee you that jobs and higher education will not care. And if they do — maybe they want to see activities related to your field of study or their area of expertise — perhaps it’s worth questioning why you want to go into a field that brings you no joy.
This goes for all types of activities. So many people at Harvard distinguish between “work” and “fun” extracurriculars, where “work” extracurriculars are an unhappy grind that you just have to do because college is a grind, and “fun” extracurriculars are squished into your remaining time so that you’re not completely miserable. You should love the pre-professional organizations you’re in just as you love playing intramural volleyball, making art, or going on Harvard-sponsored backpacking trips. You should even love your classes as much as any “fun” activity.
“Love,” of course, is a word that is hard to quantify. Perhaps you do not love, per se, the grueling late-night problem set grind of a class. But you find the content of the class interesting and appreciate how the knowledge you gain from this class will pave the way for more exciting, intellectually stimulating classes in the future. Then this class is still in the service of joy, and I would say that you love it.
Still, your love for your commitments on campus must be internally motivated. Often the people make or break a student organization, so the people within a club can factor into your enjoyment. But if the people are your only reason for staying, if the content itself makes you feel nothing or worse, that’s worth questioning. Many freshmen follow their friends into year-long obligations or get swept up in the Harvard cultural cloud of student organization clout, when in fact, they don’t love what they’re doing. Drop those commitments you don’t enjoy, and join activities that you would do even if you were the only person at Harvard doing them. You can make friends in any student organization — and often, those friendships are stronger because you share a love of the activity and structured meeting times every week or so.
Your time at Harvard is limited. You have four years of two semesters each to spend here. You will probably never do an “extracurricular” again after your education finishes. You will change over these semesters, and it’s ok to drop and switch and move around commitments as the parameters of what brings you joy change.
Moreover, your time, in general, is bounded. Within every semester, every week has only seven days, and every day has only 24 hours. Why would you fill the limited time you have with commitments you hate — that bring you no joy at all? As the common college adage goes, you’ll experience the highest highs and lowest lows at college, often one directly after another. Please don’t set yourself up for more unhappiness.
In your four years of college commitments, chase joy. In your vision of the future as extrapolated from your life now, chase joy. You can set yourself up for daily happiness, and it starts with dropping that activity you always wish you could skip.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Georgia is coming to Harvard. No, not where Justin Bieber gets his peaches — the country in the Caucasus region. The country’s Ministry of Education and Science has awarded Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies $2.3 million to establish a program for Georgian Studies at the University. The program is the first of its kind: a center dedicated to Georgian study outside of Georgia. Proclaimed as “historic” for Harvard and Georgia alike, this center represents fairly uncharted territory for Harvard’s academic community, and aims to open up Harvard students’ intellectual and physical access to the region.
We could’ve scarcely guessed that the next international center at Harvard would choose to zero in on a former Soviet republic with a smaller population than the homonymous U.S. state. Still, we are hopeful that the niche subject area is rife with exciting intellectual opportunities. The initiative’s academic output could prove rewarding, particularly if it allows academics to take a nuanced approach that is potentially critical of the Georgian government under the auspices of free speech. We are eager to see our scholarship bear fruit.
But abstract academic potential aside, why, of all possible places, is Georgia entering our syllabi? And why is that decision meaningful?
For better or worse, what we teach in Harvard classrooms matters. Our university has long-standing ties to the highest levels of the U.S. federal government and an array of direct connections to the upper echelons of one of the most powerful polities on earth. Our lectures and handouts can thus carry more geopolitical significance than we’d care to admit, shaping elite scholarship and influential views. The questions we choose to explore and the networks we help build stand in stark opposition to those stones (or countries) we leave unturned; the center for Georgian studies, with its definitional focus on a single 3.7-million-inhabitant Caucasus country, is no exception.
That doesn’t, on its own, mean that the new center nor the attached donation are somehow undesirable. Gifts from foreign countries aren’t negative in impact just by virtue of their status as foreign, even if that status warrants an extra degree of scrutiny. Rather, as we’ve argued in the past, each donation deserves to be inspected thoroughly and in good faith. Any new academic venture — particularly those that rely almost entirely on the support of a single, political donor — should be assessed with rigor and approached with continuous, healthy skepticism. Harvard must be willing to evaluate donations on their own merits and in accordance with our broader institutional values of truth and integrity, irrespective of their national origin or of how tempting their price tag might initially be. Money can rarely be separated from its motives.
The Program for Georgian Studies is also an interesting example of how what we study — where we direct our attention — is guided by where there is power, and with it capital. We are reminded that the centers and spaces we see represented on campuses like Harvard’s tend to be the ones that relate to the interests of those who can afford to fund them into existence. We know of a few very clamored-for alternatives in need of institutional support, yet a place will be carved out for scholars of Tbilisi. While Georgian studies certainly offers unique and exciting prospects, our excitement is tainted by the knowledge that other similarly fascinating nations and fields of study will remain uninspected.
The continued lack of an Ethnic Studies program, in particular, comes to mind as a bitter reminder of the scholarship we fail to fund, despite its popularity. It is yet another example of our institutional priorities becoming at least partially contingent on philanthropists’ whims, of gifts coming to define more than our budgets.
None of the above negates the program for Georgian Studies’s academic worth, and there is no doubt that it will prove thrilling for many of our peers, particularly for those from Georgia or with Georgian heritage. We look forward to seeing how this scholarship can lead to concrete improvements to our intellectual life domestically and abroad.
But if Harvard is genuinely committed to pursuing truth through education, it must pursue all that needs to be known, not merely what comes funded. After all, not all worthwhile research lies behind neatly packed, generous gifts.

Attendees of all indoor athletic events will have to present proof of full vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test, according to a new policy set by Harvard Athletics.
The policy will take effect at home games starting Oct. 15, the Athletics Department announced in a press release Friday. Vaccination compliance may be fulfilled through presenting a print or digital copy of a vaccine card, which shows two dates for the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines and one date for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Spectators who are “exempt from or ineligible” to receive the vaccine can still attend indoor events by showing a negative Covid-19 PCR test administered during the past 72 hours.
Children under the age of 12 do not need to provide proof of full vaccination or a negative test result, but they must comply with all other policies, including the indoor mask mandate set by the University and the City of Cambridge.
Due to Harvard’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate, University affiliates only have to present their ID cards to receive entry. Therefore, the Athletics update only affects non-University affiliates, such as family, local fans, and members of the media.
Indoor athletic events will remain at full capacity.
The new policy will affect Harvard teams including basketball, fencing, ice hockey, squash, indoor track and field, swimming and diving, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling.
Those who do not comply will not be admitted, but attendees who have already purchased tickets for events will be able to exchange their tickets for an event happening at a later date. They will still need to provide proof of compliance upon the later date.
Deputy Director of Athletics Nathan Fry wrote in an email to staff shared with The Crimson that the recently announced protocols “align our athletic venues with other public-facing indoor venues on Harvard’s campus.”
“We will continue to communicate our protocols and requirements to all visiting teams and ticket holders this year,” Fry noted.
Co-presidents of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee Sydney Sorkin ’21-’22, Dominique A. Petrie ’22, and Elizabeth T.C. “Liz” Boyer ’22-’23, wrote in a joint statement that they support the safety precautions.
“We’re excited to be back on campus this year, especially to compete in our respective seasons,” they wrote in the emailed statement. “Being able to have our fans and community support us in person is a vital part of our athletic experience and we support any measure that allows our fans to do this in a safe manner.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to establish a social inclusion grant for College students, propose that faculty review Harvard’s guidelines on free speech, and to fund a late-night transportation program at a meeting on Sunday evening.
The first act revives a fund made available by the UC twice in the past, which students can use to host social events.
According to the resolution, the initiative was popular in its past iterations.
“The Social Inclusion Grant idea was already run twice, built off of desires voiced by groups of students looking for support to throw social events” the act reads. “There are huge gaps on campus for students to engage in social life and open spaces are far and too few, especially following COVID-19.”
The program puts aside $6,000 from UC funds to be dispersed over the course of eight weeks, with each week having up to $750 set aside for events.
The grants will be accessible to all students at the College. Each week, the UC will fund one small event of fewer than 50 people and one large event of greater than 50 people, per the legislation.
Application cycles for the grant will close each Sunday at 6 p.m., with priority given to events that would not have occurred without the funding, the guidelines read.
The legislation was sponsored by UC President Noah A. Harris ’22, Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22, Pforzheimer House Representative Lisa R. Mathew ’24, and Lowell House Representative David Y. Zhang, and was passed by unanimous consent.
The second act proposes that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences review and update the FAS’s Free Speech Guidelines, which were established in 1990.
“The Free Speech Guidelines are a critical component of creating what Dean Gay described in Harvard’s new, anti-racist agenda as an ‘inclusive scholarly community,’” the act reads.
According to the act, there have been numerous instances in the past year that involved the Free Speech Guidelines, and it is likely that Harvard will continue to encounter such situations.
The UC recommended that the faculty establish a review committee that is equally split between undergraduates and faculty members.
“The Undergraduate Council will not advocate for specific changes to the Freedom of Speech Guidelines without direct input from the student body,” the legislation reads.
The Council would communicate the opinions of the student body to the review committee through future referendums and policy recommendations, the UC act added.
The act was sponsored by Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and was passed by unanimous consent.
The UC also passed a third piece of legislation to fund a late-night transportation program in partnership with Lyft.
“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public transportation closes early, is potentially COVID-19 unsafe, and the importance of efficient travel (i.e. from the Quad to the River, to the SEC, etc.), especially as it gets colder, cannot be understated,” the legislation reads.
The program will lottery up to 500 students to receive up to $15 in ride credits, with priority going to those who are Student Events Fund-eligible.
The legislation was also sponsored by Harris and Gan, and passed by unanimous consent.

Administrators at the Dean of Students Office said in a Friday interview they were working toward easing the transition from remote learning to in-person instruction for students, as well as opening up common spaces for undergraduate use.
“I think it’s really important for us to collectively acknowledge that we’ve all made this transition back to a fully dense campus in a very short period of time,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said.
“I think part of how students are experiencing it is some students have really embraced being in person and everything that comes with being in person and their student organizations, and other students are more hesitant to want to be as present in large group events,” she added.
This fall, the College invited back all students for on-campus living and in-person instruction, after restricting residential accommodations to select class cohorts and implementing virtual classes due to the ongoing pandemic.
“There’s the whole operational piece of having people arrive, which was supported by so many different people and so many different partners across the University and the College,” Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said. “We are really thankful for everyone’s efforts.”
As undergraduates have moved back into on-campus housing, some have lamented the lack of open common spaces, such as the student-run house grilles.
Brandt said these concerns are being addressed and explained that reopening spaces has been a “learning curve.”
“It has been a period of time where our buildings weren’t at full capacity, and so there have been some things that I know are being addressed,” Brandt said. “The building managers are working very hard to know what’s going on in their spaces and to work on that.”
“I would ask that people remember that these are also student-run spaces, and so having moments where students are transitioning into positions that they haven’t really had a chance to do in a while, that’s a learning curve for them, it’s a learning curve for us,” she added.
Brandt cited hiring processes as one factor that has contributed to the delay in reopening of house grilles.
“Part of it depends on hiring,” Brandt said. “There are trainings that need to happen in terms of food safety, preparation, making sure the spaces are ready to be used because they haven’t been used for a year and a half.”
“There’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes,” she added.
When asked about student compliance with Covid-19 protocols, O’Dair said she believed the student body was doing “very well.”
In the beginning of the semester, the College experienced a surge of Covid-19 cases among undergraduates, leading the College to increase the testing cadence for residents of undergraduate housing from one to three times a week.
“We certainly had in the first couple weeks that small uptick [in cases], but we have seen that go down, and we have seen it go down by increasing the testing,” O’Dair said. “Students have been very compliant.”
The DSO also spoke about its goals for the 2021-22 academic year, which include using data to inform how programming and policy decisions affect the student experience, continuing its work to become an anti-racist institution, and identifying strategies to address stressors faced by students.
“This year, we’re focused on a few things, so we’re considering the strength of the DSO through an inclusive excellence framework,” Associate Dean of Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro said.
“It’s really looking at our organization, who we bring into the organization, how do we retain talent, how do we prepare talent, and are there any things that we need to learn about that would suggest that we have some really awesome new, clear equity goals,” she added.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education Student Council will prioritize amplifying underrepresented students’ voices and bridging the gap between students learning remotely and in person, according to several of the council’s members.
In interviews, four members of HGSE’s Student Council, who sit on the Student Advocacy and Issues Committee and the Programming and Events Committee, shared their goals for the 2021-22 academic year.
Members of the events committee said they will try to host events that accommodate students who are learning remotely.
Lisha M. F. Bornilla said the events committee will try to accommodate all students.
“We’re going to try to aim for 100 percent of the events that we want to do [to be] inclusive in terms of creating a hybrid model where we hold in-person events, but give people the ability to access those events remotely,” she said.
Bornilla also said that she hopes to create events that address student mental health.
“I’ve talked to people who are definitely feeling like they don’t have the tools to handle the stress, the workload,” she said.
Jasmine N. Stecker, a member of the advocacy committee, said she believes students are still experiencing adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I think the pandemic is still affecting most students, if not all, and one of the more silenced voices right now are part-time students, especially students that aren’t on campus,” she said. “They have been advocating for more access to online courses, or even in-person courses if they happen to be in the area.”
Students who are learning remotely this semester were accepted into an HGSE special admissions program during the summer of 2020 that enabled students, many of whom work full-time, to enroll part-time and virtually at HGSE.
Stecker said she believes her role on the council is to highlight the concerns of students who do not speak up.
“It’ll be an interesting challenge for the council to really seek out those communities that need a voice but aren’t loud,” she said. “It’s hard at Harvard because there are so many communities that are very, very loud, but we can’t just take those who are loud and forget those who are not.”
Xidong “Max” Tang, who also sits on the advocacy committee, said he will strive to support underrepresented student groups.
To better support first generation students, for instance, he said the council and University should provide workshops on “how to get a good job.” He also said he believes there should be more resources on campus for BGLTQ students.
Council member Kanan Dubal also said she believes the school’s administration should solicit feedback from international students, especially as HGSE launches its new Master’s program. The program, announced in February, places emphasis on teaching students foundational knowledge before more specialized training.
“I feel like student voices will be very important in defining these programs and getting feedback from students,” Dubal said. “I wanted the international student community’s voice to be heard on those particular issues as well, to make sure that the programs are more inclusive, they’re reaching all sorts of populations, and not just catering to a specific subset of students.”

The University saw a decrease in the total number of crimes reported to the Harvard University Police Department, according to this year’s annual security report released Friday.
The total number of reported crimes in 2020 was 178, down from the 220 total crimes reported in 2019. On-campus crimes also saw a 14 percent decrease in 2020 — when college students were sent home in March, and only freshmen were invited to live back on campus in the fall.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano announced the report in an email to affiliates Friday afternoon. The report, entitled “Playing it Safe,” is prepared every year in compliance with the Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities that receive federal funding to share an annual security report with affiliates every Oct. 1.
The report also must keep affiliates apprised of security policies on campus.
The report indicated a sharp decline in reported sexual assaults on campus. The number of rapes from 2019 to 2020 decreased by more than 38 percent. This follows a four-year trend of decrease in the reported rape incidence.
Other sex-based crimes, such as fondling, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking also saw a decrease since 2019.
Aggravated assaults, however, increased in 2020, solidifying a three-year upward trend. Nearly all of the reported aggravated assaults occurred in public property that is within, adjacent, or accessible to campus.
HUPD’s new crime and workload dashboard, which was developed as a response to a 2020 external review, reveals that property crimes make up more than one in 10 of every part one offense — a type of crime against people and property defined by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. Violent crimes, by contrast, constitute less than one in every 10 offenses.
The number of burglaries increased by more than 20 percent since 2019, breaking a pattern of decline in burglaries in the past five years.
While burglaries were reported with the most frequency to HUPD, larcenies — which do not have to be included in the annual Clery report — make up an even greater amount, composing 77 percent of the property crimes that occur on campus, per the police department’s dashboard.
Robberies decreased in 2020, per the report. 2019 saw 20 robberies, but only 11 occurred in 2020.
While on-campus disciplinary actions decreased overall, drug law violations increased from nine in 2019 to 14 in 2020.
Overall arrests decreased nearly by half, and bias crimes decreased as well, going from seven in 2019 to only two in 2020.
Similarly to previous years, the vast majority of crimes HUPD recorded — nearly 90 percent — occurred on Harvard’s Cambridge campus, which houses the College and graduate schools such as the Law School and Business School. The other 10 percent of crimes were recorded in the Longwood Medical Campus, and for the first time in four years, at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum near the Jamaica Plain neighborhood in Boston.
In addition to the Annual Security Report, the Harvard Environmental Health and Safety Department released a report on fire safety required by the Clery Act. The report showed that zero fires had been reported in all of 2020, a decrease from the four seen in 2019 and four more in 2018.
Correction: October 3, 2022:
A previous version of this article included a graph that incorrectly displayed the total number of crimes reported on Harvard's campus in 2020.

UPDATED: October 4, 2021 at 4:45 p.m.
A car crashed into the building of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, late Sunday night.
In a video reviewed by The Crimson, a gray Ford sedan can be seen driving in the bicycle lane on Mt. Auburn Street. The car turned to the left in an apparent attempt to swerve around a bollard, knocking over a parking meter and a traffic sign before careening into the side of the Lampoon building.
The Cambridge Police Department and the Cambridge Fire Department responded to the incident.
According to eyewitnesses, the driver of the car was uninjured after the accident. The Lampoon building retained little damage from the crash, with one of its lower windows broken.
Several Lampoon members exited the building to survey the scene. Maxwell A. Gay ’21-’22, president of the Lampoon, declined to comment on the scene.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick confirmed in an email that the crash did not cause damage to The Lampoon building, and that the driver was not injured. The driver was ordered to appear in court for driving an uninsured vehicle.
“The driver reported losing control of their vehicle due to the heavy rain,” Warnick wrote. “The operator was not injured and refused medical attention. They were summonsed for Operating a Motor Vehicle with Revoked Insurance and an Uninsured Motor Vehicle.”
Nathan Sun ’24, a Crimson Business editor, said he had just walked past the Lampoon on his way to his DeWolfe Street apartment around midnight. He reported hearing a car swerve behind him, noting the roads were slick due to the rain.
“I initially thought somebody ran over a pothole or something. But I look back and there was just this car that ran into the Lampoon and then the horn is blaring,” Sun said.
Jordan H. Barton ’23 posted a video on Twitter showing the aftermath of the crash.
In an email, Barton wrote that they live in Adams House off Plympton Street, where they had a clear view of the emergency vehicles attending to the Lampoon building.
“Though my roommates and I were not at the street level, our windows were open, so we heard the initial crash — a sudden wheel spinning and then a large thud — at street level, and then heard the proceeding car horn that began to sound and didn’t cease for at least 10 minutes,” Barton wrote.
Pierre J. Lamont-Dobbin ’24 said the driver of the car exited the vehicle and seemed to be okay as he observed the damage to his car.
“I was in my house in my dorm room in Adams right there and we just heard a giant crash and then the honking. We literally thought it was thunder. And then I just got my roommate. I was like, ‘let's go make sure everyone’s okay,’” Lamont-Dobbin said.
In 2019, a vehicle crashed into The Crimson building while attempting to park on Plympton Street. The driver suffered minor injuries and the building was lightly damaged.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard opened its 2021 Ivy League slate against Yale on Saturday night, holding the reigning Ivy League champions to a 0-0 tie through overtime in New Haven.
In an eventful but ultimately scoreless affair, Harvard (3-3-2, 0-0-1 Ivy League) was not able to break down Yale’s defense and had to settle for a draw after 110 minutes in Connecticut. More than 800 fans came out to the game, with the match being the first time the rivals have played in almost two years.
“This was the most intense game and hostile environment we’ve played in so far,” sophomore defender Nik White said. “Holding the reigning champions to a draw on their field definitely gives us confidence moving forward, but we know we need to continue improving in certain aspects.”
White featured for the whole 110 minutes for the Crimson, along with fellow center back, first-year Jan Riecke, junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson, and defender and captain Fernando Docters. Docters received an early yellow card in the eighteenth minute, but remained disciplined throughout the match and was able to keep the Bulldogs’ attack in check despite the caution.
Harvard was somewhat slow to start in the first half, conceding the majority of the possession to Yale while getting outshot six to three, and conceding seven corners while only winning two. But despite having less possession, the Crimson defended well and kept the Bulldogs from having any clear-cut chances in the first half.
Harvard had a good chance to go ahead in the 36th minute after first-year midfielder Sam Bjarnason shot from the edge of the crowded Yale box, but the strike skidded wide as the crowd held its breath.
The Bulldogs had their best chance to go ahead just on the other side of halftime, as Nilsson bailed the Crimson out after Yale got ahead on a dangerous ball whipped into the box. The header connected perfectly for what seemed like a sure goal, but Nilsson got across to keep the game scoreless.
“Ivy League games become more intense because of the engagement from the fans and the prestige between the schools, especially against a rival like Yale,” Nilsson said of the night. “It’s important to handle and grow with that pressure.”
The rest of the second half was played on Harvard’s terms, as the Crimson settled into the game and began to dominate possession for long stretches of time. Harvard outshot the Bulldogs nine to six in the second half while winning seven corners and holding Yale to just one.
The Crimson came within inches of taking the game in the 77th minute, as in-form first-year striker Alessandro Arlotti was denied the game-winner by the crossbar. Docters took a shot from deep after a corner was cleared, and Arlotti deftly redirected the strike, leaving the Yale goalkeeper stranded, but the shot bounced off the crossbar, and play continued.
With neither team finding the back of the net through 90 minutes, the game went to overtime, the fourth time Harvard has played overtime this season in only eight games. While the Crimson continued to play positively, neither side was able to find the golden goal, and both teams had to settle for a draw.
“This was the first taste of Ivy League action for half of our squad. We were very aware of the significance of Harvard versus Yale heading into the game and made sure we represented the university with pride,” White said of the matchup. “I’m so proud of the desire and focus we showed to earn a hard-fought away point against the reigning champions.”
The draw means that the Crimson still leads the all-time matchup at 59-39-13. Harvard returns home to play Boston University on Tuesday, before making the trek out to Ithaca to face Cornell on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No.10/20 Harvard spoiled Yale’s alumni weekend on Saturday in New Haven, controlling the game throughout en route to a 2-0 win at Reese Stadium that allowed the Crimson to remain one of the four undefeated teams in the nation. Harvard (8-0-1, 2-0-0 Ivy League) had chances to take the lead in the first half before getting second-half goals from two unlikely sources, with junior right back Jordan Di Verniero capitalizing on a goalkeeping mistake to tally her first of the season before sophomore midfielder Hannah Griffin scored the first goal of her college career in the game’s dying minutes to clinch a win over the Crimson’s biggest rival.
As has often been the case this season, Harvard dominated both possession and chances, taking 23 shots, including 17 on goal, to Yale’s six. The 2-0 final score flatters the Bulldogs (1-9, 0-2), who were often on their heels and had a few squandered Crimson chances and some impressive saves by first-year goalie and Baylor transfer Maya Bellomo to thank for the relatively modest scoreline.
Bellomo was called upon more often than Yale would have liked. She made 15 saves on the day and was constantly darting around the six-yard box as she aggressively met the countless Harvard through balls and one-on-ones that she had to face. Her performance was not without incident, however. She looked vulnerable on the Crimson’s set pieces and spilled the ball a few times, one of which was responsible for Harvard’s first goal. She attempted to collect a dangerous cross from talismanic first-year midfielder Hannah Bebar but could not do so cleanly, and Di Verniero was there to pounce on the rebound and catapult it into the net.
“[Di Verniero] has had a number of close calls this season and is unlucky not to be on the scoresheet in previous games,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I’m really glad she opened her account this year by being persistent and following up on a loose ball.”
While her cross did lead to a Crimson goal, Bebar was not credited with an assist, meaning the end of her five-game points streak. Junior forward Angela Caloia, another name often on the scoresheet, came very close to scoring on multiple occasions, none more so than when two of her shots were cleared off the line by defenders, one in each half. Caloia racked up seven shots, easily a season-high.
Yale never really threatened to score, but it did ramp up the pressure late in the game, with a high press that at least temporarily took Harvard out of its attacking flow and gave the Bulldogs their first semblance of sustained possession in the Crimson’s half. It was on a counterattack against the press, however, that Griffin was able to showcase her speed and notch her first career goal, as she ran onto the ball at midfield and sprinted past the stretched Yale defense before finishing past Bellomo.
“We know that if teams come to press us, we have the ability to play through that press and get at them in numbers-up situations,” Hamblin said. “We are comfortable with those situations so as they started to press higher we knew we were going to get some chances, and [Griffin] took it perfectly.”
While Griffin’s goal ended up being immaterial to the game’s outcome, it took on increased significance because of Griffin’s long journey to college soccer minutes, having missed her entire first-year season due to injury in 2019. Now that she is back and firing on all cylinders, she has become a key part of the team’s attack.
“Hannah Griffin’s a great player,” said Bebar after Harvard’s victory over Penn last weekend. “She is able to get in behind and has a lot of pace, so I think we will continue to have a lot of success playing her in behind. I love playing with her and with all of our forwards.”
The Crimson’s defense again also looked comfortable, allowing Harvard to keep a second consecutive clean sheet to start the Ivy League season. The spine of the team — with senior center back Lara Schenk partnering with first-year Jade Rose, and captain Sophie Hirst next to first-year Josefine Hasbo ahead of them in central midfield — has been solid and looks to be building chemistry, having played nearly every minute of the season together.
“I think we defended really well from front to back,” Hamblin said. “We kept the ball really well, and when you keep the ball well, you don’t give the opposition many opportunities to attack you. Our ability to possess drove our defensive performance because we didn’t give many opportunities away. Then when we did give the ball away we were able to defend pretty comprehensively and didn’t give them too much.”
First-year forward Ainsley Ahmadian and senior forward Murphy Agnew remained out due to injuries they suffered against Kansas two weekends ago. Hamblin said he anticipates that they will return to training this week and potentially be involved again as soon as next weekend. Griffin and sophomore forward Gabby DelPico started in their places on Saturday, but the team will be eager to get them back before the pivotal Ivy League matchups in the weekends ahead.
The Crimson will be on the road again next weekend as it faces Cornell in Ithaca. The Big Red (2-6-2, 1-1-0) notched its first Ivy League win since 2016 in an opening weekend victory over Columbia before falling 2-0 at Penn. Harvard will look to move to 3-0 in the conference season before returning home for two mammoth showdowns with its toughest Ancient Eight competition, Brown and Princeton.

Sure, they may look dapper, but I can’t help but have some questions. Are they going on an adventure on their scooter to a punch event… perhaps. But, I can also choose to believe that an even cooler destination is in store on a Tuesday evening. If you too want to ask some nicely dressed people a question as you contemplate your own life on your way to Lamont at 9 p.m., here are some starting points to get the convo flowing.
Hey, is that tux rented? (If yes, did your scooter come with the rental?) 
I appreciate a nice usage of alternative transportation — scooters, bikes, legs, shuttle. For research purposes, I also would like to know where the tux is from. We love seeing people in suits scooting at 9 p.m.! I would just like to join!
Who’s your prom date?
Another subtle way to inquire about the suit and the vibes. You could even offer to snap some pics for mom, I’m sure she would appreciate that! Bonus: a lowkey (highkey?) assertion that they could pass for high schoolers…
Can I have your pocket square? 
We’ve seen a few spiffy men in suits with pocket squares. But the question remains, can I have it? Please?
Going to the Hamptons? Me too. 
This is perfect for someone wearing a tan or linen suit. We may officially be in fall, but fashion (as well as Cambridge weather) knows no boundaries. It’s also a great time to assure them that you, too, are in the *know*.
Where’s the wedding?
Are you a groomsman? Perhaps a flower girl? Maybe a bridesmaid? Regardless, I hope there’s cake where you’re headed. And, you know, not just social pressure and even more people dressed in suits.
All in all, we enjoy seeing people in suits looking fancy. Just as geese must fly south for the winter, so too must the suits emerge for punch season. At least that means cuffing season is not far behind?
