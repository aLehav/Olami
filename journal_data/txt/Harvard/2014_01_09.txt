After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the rest of the College off for break, The Back Page is keeping up with the Harvard men’s basketball team (13-1) as it finishes the remainder of its nonconference schedule. With Harvard starting Ivy League play on Jan. 11 against Dartmouth, staff writer David Freed takes a look at the Crimson’s penultimate nonconference opponent—the Connecticut Huskies.
After winning 13 of its first 14 games of the season—Harvard’s best start of the century—the Crimson will travel to Gampel Pavilion to play the Connecticut Huskies (11-3) on Wednesday.
Coach
Connecticut is coached by alumnus Kevin Ollie, who played for the Huskies under his coaching predecessor, Jim Calhoun, from 1991-95 before spending fifteen years as a journeyman in the NBA. Ollie played for 11 different professional teams before returning to Storrs as an assistant coach in 2010, when Connecticut won the national championship behind star guard Kemba Walker.
Ollie served briefly as interim head coach when Calhoun was suspended for the first three Big East games of the 2011-2012 season and took over full time when Calhoun retired in 2012. In his first year as head coach, the Huskies went 20-10—including wins over Syracuse and Michigan State—but were banned from postseason competition by the NCAA because of several years of below-standard scores on the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate metric.
Roster
The Connecticut attack is centered around senior guard Shabazz Napier. A part of the 2010 championship team, Napier has improved every year and is now a Naismith Award candidate who does it all for his team, leading in points, rebounds, assists, and steals. Napier’s backcourt partner—junior Ryan Boatright—complements the senior nicely, averaging nearly 13 points and four assists per game. Both players shoot over 43 percent from beyond the arc.
Overall, the Huskies are one of the best shooting teams in the country. Collectively, Connecticut shoots 41 percent from behind the arc, and four starters shoot higher than that mark. Even 6’9” junior forward DeAndre Daniels shoots 42 percent from deep and has taken more threes (40) than free throws (37) on the year.
The Huskies are a deep team, with eight players averaging at least ten minutes per game. In its win over Florida, Connecticut used ten players. Senior guard Niels Griffey—a 61.8 three-point shooter—gives UConn a deep threat off the bench, and underclassmen Phillip Nolan (6’10”) and Amida Brimah (7’0”) are part of a deep frontcourt rotation.
Nonconference Play
Connecticut started the season on a nine game win streak—including a 65-64 win over Florida on a buzzer beater by Napier. After the win against Florida, the Huskies briefly cracked the Associated Press Top 10 before losing its first game at home to Stanford, 53-51. After losing to the Cardinal, the team dropped two of its next four games—including its first two conference games on the road—to Houston (75-71) and SMU (74-65).
The Crimson and the Huskies have one common opponent: Boston College. Connecticut beat the Eagles at home, 72-70, in late November, behind 23 points from Daniels. Harvard defeated the Eagles by 15 points at home, 73-58, on Wednesday.
Series History
The two teams have met 18 times, with the Huskies winning 16. Two years ago, the Crimson came into Gampel Pavilion with its first-ever national ranking, but the ninth-ranked Huskies emerged with a 67-53 victory, knocking the Crimson out of the Top 25.
Last year, the Huskies took out the Crimson, 57-49, behind 23 points from Daniels. Boatright added 16 points for Connecticut, which blew open a three-point game midway through the second half with a 15-4 run. Then-sophomore Wesley Saunders led the Crimson with 14 points and held Napier to just six points on the night, including none in the first 33 minutes of play.
Overall Matchup 
Despite his success at Harvard, coach Tommy Amaker has yet to beat Connecticut in four meetings. Whether he can do so in 2014 will likely rest on the shoulders of sophomore guard Siyani Chambers. Saunders will get his points and shoulder the tough task of guarding Napier, but Chambers’ ability to beat Boatright off the dribble and get into the lane to create space for Harvard’s shooters could be the deciding factor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the third period began to wind down at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center Tuesday night, the clock became Harvard’s biggest enemy. After Quinnipiac (15-3-5, 6-2-3 ECAC) took a 2-1 lead on a quick wrist shot from junior forward Matthew Peca early in the final frame, the Crimson (5-7-3, 2-6-3 ECAC) spent the remainder of the period looking for an equalizer.
Harvard generated several chances but failed to find the back of the net for most of the period. However with under a minute to go, after Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard vacated his net in favor of an extra attacker, Harvard delivered.
Deep in the Bobcats’ territory, sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo fired the puck toward the crease from out wide. In the midst of a scrum in front of the net, freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot squeezed the puck past Quinnipiac goaltender Michael Garteig, tying the game at two with 49 seconds left to play.
“[The puck] just went off some part of my body and found a way in the net,” Kerfoot said. “I don’t really know how it happened.”
Kerfoot’s goal proved to be the last score of the night, as the two teams skated to a 2-2 draw in the first conference tilt of 2014 for each side.
BRINGING HIS BEST FOR THE BOBCATS
 
Criscuolo was all over the ice for the Crimson. In addition to picking up an assist on the game-tying score, the forward netted his eighth goal of the season midway through the second period.
With Quinnipiac leading 1-0, Criscuolo left a drop pass for Kerfoot at the top of the right circle and moved towards the front of the net. Seconds later, the sophomore received a pass from junior Max Everson and pushed it past Garteig to tie the game.
“[Criscuolo] wins battles, gets you the puck, goes hard to the net, does everything right,” Kerfoot said.
The young forward has had nothing but success over the course of his collegiate career against the Bobcats, scoring in each of his three matchups against Quinnipiac. Criscuolo’s most recent goal marked the second time he has beaten Garteig this season, after having recorded a power play goal in a 3-2 loss to the Bobcats in November.
Last season, Criscuolo notched his first goal against Quinnipiac—one that actually parallels his latest score. The Bobcats had gotten on the board first, but the forward tied the game at one in that contest as well, providing a spark for the Crimson who went on to win 2-1 in overtime.
“It’s pretty unique playing with [Criscuolo],” Kerfoot said. “He’s kind of different [from] anyone I’ve ever played with, but he’s one of the hardest working guys I’ve ever been around. If you get the puck in down low, he’s going to win every battle.”
PERFECT PENALTY-KILLING
 
The Bobcats entered the game with the top penalty-killing unit in the nation, successfully fighting off 91.9 percent of opponents’ power plays. That percentage would only increase as Quinnipiac managed to kill all four penalties that it surrendered to Harvard.
In fact, over the course of the Crimson’s four advantages, Harvard could only muster four shots on net—all from sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey. With less than nine minutes remaining in the game, the Crimson finally generated a few scoring chances on its final power play, but the Bobcats maintained their one-goal lead.
“They’ve given a lot of teams trouble [on the penalty kill],” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s tough to even get the puck in the zone…They don’t miss a lot of opportunities on their clears, and there’s a reason why they’re the top team in the country [in that regard].”
Meanwhile, Harvard’s penalty-killing unit kept pace with that of its opponent. Carrying the 12th best penalty-killing percentage in the nation at 85.2 percent, the Crimson also staved off each of the Bobcats’ four power plays.
Tuesday’s showing marked a major improvement over the team’s performance on the penalty-kill against Boston University last Saturday. Harvard did fight off a BU power play in the waning minutes of regulation with the game on the line, but prior to that, the Terriers had scored on each of their first three man advantages.
Quinnipiac remains atop the nation in penalty-killing percentage after its strong performance against the Crimson, while Harvard’s four stops fittingly move the team up four spots into eighth place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, Conn.—With 34 seconds to play at Gampel Pavilion on Wednesday night, Crimson senior Laurent Rivard drilled a three and hit the and-one to pull the Harvard men’s basketball team within four points of Connecticut, 55-51. At the other end of the court, however, Huskies guards Ryan Boatright and Shabazz Napier went 4-2 in the final moments of the contest to extend the Huskies (12-3, 0-2 American) lead over the Crimson (13-2).
Rivard and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers countered with a lay-up apiece each to close the gap to three, and with nine seconds to play, a travel by Connecticut forward Niels Giffey gave the Crimson a chance to do what it has not since Dec. 1972 – beat the talented Huskies.
Yet Chambers and co-captain Brandyn Curry found themselves boxed in by Connecticut’s lengthy defenders, unable to make a play. Curry gave up the ball with two seconds on the clock, and Harvard found itself taking its first loss of 2014, 61-56.
“Coach told me to go out there and make a play,” Chambers said. “At the end there we had created some confusion, and Brandyn unfortunately slipped and threw it up and lost control of the ball.”
Notably absent was junior guard Wesley Saunders, the leading scorer for the Crimson who nabbed a team-high 14 points during last season’s outing in Storrs, and sat on the bench due to injury.
“Coach’s motto is ‘next person up’,” Chambers said. “Wesley went down; we were just going to do as a team and somebody’s going to step up and play their role that they have….. We handled [Saunders’ absence] really well.”
In his place, Chambers and Curry controlled the shallow backcourt and each played all but two minutes of the game. Curry, who also has dealt with injury this season, played under 20 minutes in his past three games – the first the senior had played in over a month.
“Brandyn has worked himself back to being able to play extended minutes,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m sure he got tired, not just because of the minutes but because of the players that these guys had to guard out there. Those two guards [Boatright and Napier] are electic and dynamic, and they’re a handful.”
Chambers, who ran the floor for the entire second half despite having a noticeable limp at times, led all scorers with 21 points. He converted five of his seven three-point attempts, including an extra-long trey that snipped the Huskies lead to two with just over three minutes remaining in the game.
But besides Chambers’ efficiency from deep, the Crimson watched three after three rim out. The team went 9-for-22 overall in the game.
“We certainly felt that we were going to have opportunities to get threes,” Amaker said. “Not all the threes…were great shots. The way I think about it right now is that we were going to take our shots when we have them.”
Shooting proved to be the weakness for a Saunders-less Crimson against a team capable of running a smothering defense. Harvard shot at 36 percent through the game, markedly under their season average, and at just 27 percent during the final 20 minutes. It was perhaps fatigue, a loss of momemtum, and the deafening cries of a home crowd that proved lethal to Harvard in the end.
Yet the first half showed glimmers of hope that a Crimson squad with Saunders relegated to the bench could, in fact, take down a team that just recently ended a run of nine consecutive weeks in the AP Top 25.
Powered by the play of veteran Curry, who doled out six of the team’s 12 assists during the tilt, and the efficient shooting of Chambers, it was Harvard who led heading into the locker room, 31-26.
As the Crimson confronted the play of Connecticut’s forward’s, most of who are at or within inches of seven feet tall, the Crimson’s big men became even more important.
Driving the interior presence senior was Kyle Casey, who had nine points on the night, eight of which came during the first 20 minutes, as well as a game-high nine defensive rebounds. Sophomore Agunwa Okolie also proved formidable on the glass with six total boards.
Despite occasional mismatches in size, Harvard found itself at the good end of the turnover stick, driving the Huskies to commit 11 in the opening frame, despite the team having a season average of just nine per game. With those increased opportunities at possessions came more chances at baskets, and a steadier rhythm for the Crimson.
Momentum was a key to Harvard’s success in the first stanza, with a 12-0 run late in the half giving the Crimson its first lead since the opening minute of the game. Yet rhythm also proved lethal to Harvard, as the Huskies rattled off runs of 7-0 at points of each frame, and controlled the speed as they took a lead they would never relinquish early in the second half.
The contest is the last for Harvard before it opens its Ivy season against Dartmouth on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the day he turned 22, senior Ross Friedman got a present he had only ever dreamed about: a contract from Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew.
“I have been thinking about the Crew since I was young,” Freidman said. “I was super excited. It’s been a dream of mine for a long time.”
Friedman, a Columbus native, has trained with the team’s developmental academy since he was a freshman in high school. Although the MLS SuperDraft is not until Jan. 16, Friedman was signed early using the league’s Homegrown Player rule. The rule says that if a player has trained with the club’s youth development program for one year, then he can sign his first professional contract without going through the SuperDraft process.
“They invested in me at a young age when I played at their youth academy,” Friedman said. “They take that investment, and MLS rewards them with first rights to the local players.”
Friedman began to talk with the Crew after the Crimson’s season-ending loss to Penn. In his senior season, the co-captain led the Ivy League with 10 assists, good enough for seventh nationally. He will be the third Crimson player in the MLS, joining Andre Akpan ’09 (New York Red Bulls) and Michael Fucito ’08 (San Jose Earthquakes).
The Crew, who also announced the signing of Xavier midfielder Matt Walker on Tuesday, has signed seven players under the provision in the last six years. Walker played with Friedman on the 2011 Crew Juniors Super-20 team, which won the national championship.
“The youth program benefits from it since little kids from my hometown can look and see [hometown players] playing on the Crew,” Friedman said. “It builds on the local environment, and it’s exciting because we are number one in the league with the most homegrown players. These are guys that I played with in high school—it is a familiar environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first two periods, it seemed as though the University of Connecticut would become Harvard women’s hockey’s first loss since the first week of its 2013-14 campaign. But it only took twenty seconds for that to change.
The No. 4/5 Crimson (11-1-2, 7-1-1 ECAC) faced off against the Huskies (4-13-2, 1-4-1 Hockey East) in the Freitas Ice Forum, finishing with a 2-1 victory on Tuesday night. While Harvard had a total of 33 attempts on goal compared to UConn’s 25, the team was unable to convert any shots until the third period.
“Overall we were happy with how we finished the game,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “However, we have a lot to take from this game, especially coming out with more fire and playing strong for 60 minutes.”
Over 14 minutes into the third period, senior defenseman Elizabeth Parker converted an assist from her sister, sophomore forward Mary Parker, by finding the back of the net off of a rebound despite overcrowding in front of the goal.
“Mary and Elizabeth both played really well,” interim head coach Maura Crowell said. “Especially Elizabeth as a senior kind of was feeling it. She had a great game and to put that goal away for us was huge. The momentum shifts, and the release after playing nearly 60 minutes of hockey down a goal was awesome.”
The goal put the Crimson on the scoreboard, tying the game 1-1 after an early net by the Huskies’ junior forward Kayla Campero put UConn up. Just 11 minutes into the first period, Campero managed to slap her shot past freshman goaltender Brianna Liang off an assist from teammates Michela Cava and Emily Snodgrass to give the Huskies an advantage it would maintain for the majority of the game.
“I think everybody was doing what [he or she] thought they should do to win the game,” Crowell said. “It was just a hard game. It was a gutsy win in the end. We weren’t sure what was going to happen, but the energy on the bench was really great through, and they really believed they could win this game.”
While on paper Connecticut’s rank in nowhere near Harvard’s this season, the Huskies’ style of play proved difficult for the Crimson to counter.
“[UConn] is a tough place to go,” Crowell said. “The environment is dead, there’s three people in the stands, there’s no energy in the building, and they’re a big, kind of slow, type of team and it really plays more to their favor. It felt like we were on a power play the whole time. We had the puck in their zone a lot, but they just sit around and clog up the slot, so it’s tough.”
Despite an early lead, Parker’s goal to tie the game turned the tides in Harvard’s favor for the rest of the period. Twenty seconds after her goal, junior defenseman Sarah Edney managed to take the extended Harvard offensive run and convert it to a goal to give the Crimson the lead.
“Whenever we’re down a goal in the end we do take some liberties,” Crowell said. “We had the [defense] jump in quite a bit and we put more pressure on the other team, but as the pressure builds we answered the bell. In general it wasn’t a crazy change of attack, it was just continually knocking at the door and finally getting a couple to go through and not giving up and staying determined to find that open space.”
Both teams went 0 for 3 power plays, and Harvard won 24 face-offs compared to UConn’s 22. Both freshman Sydney Daniels and sophomore Mary Parker had attempts that just missed the net in the first half, and Parker led the team with eight shots on net.
“I knew we hadn’t played our best against Northeastern,” Crowe said. “We wanted to get back to Harvard Hockey, and play a simple and smart game and out work our opponent all over the ice.”
The Crimson had a hard time trying to slip past the Huskies’ defense until the last five minutes of the game. While Liang had 24 saves, UConn goaltender Elaine Chuli made 31 saves.
“[We] need to come out with intensity right away and maintain that,” Crowe said. “We need to do what we do best…for a full 60 minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13 Harvard men’s volleyball team was a little out of place in French-speaking Canada this Wednesday. But the squad’s performance was in no way hindered by the language barrier.
Trailing by one entering the fourth set, the Crimson rallied to win the last two sets and take down Laval University, 3-2, in Quebec City, marking the program’s first-ever win in Canada and first victory of the season.
With 25 points not enough to settle the fourth set, the two teams played extra in order to resolve what ended up being the penultimate match. The Rouge et Or was unable to knock off Harvard, which managed to win the set, 27-25. The Crimson carried that momentum into the final set, recording eight kills and only one error in a 15-12 victory.
Junior outside hitter DJ White led the Harvard attack with 21 kills over five sets. Junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick and senior outside hitter Nick Madden complemented the Crimson offense with 12 and 10 kills, respectively.
Despite playing one more set in than in its recent loss to Long Beach State, Harvard recorded three fewer errors and had a kill percentage of .386, a stark contrast from the .250 mark set in its season opener.
The Crimson came out of the gates slowly as the team adjusted to using the Canadian volleyball, a different model than the one used in American Division I athletics.
“It comes off of [the opponents’] hands differently,” Zimmick said. “It moves a lot more than the ball we play with.”
Harvard had trouble passing float serves in the early stages of the game. However, with enough repetitions, the Crimson acclimated to the change and was able to solve the puzzle.
“I think we really turned it around,” Zimmick said. “After the first couple of sets, we got the hang of playing … with a different ball and really stepped it up towards the end of the match.”
One of the reasons for the offensive turnaround was freshman setter Nick Bendell, who chipped in provided 53 assists.
“He’s really doing well,” Zimmick said. “He’s connecting with [senior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper] and I really well in the middle so far.”
Bendell’s success comes despite his inexperience, and the Illinois native has made a quick adjustment to the collegiate level.
“There’s usually a lot of pressure that comes with being a freshman setter,” Bendell said. “But the guys on the team and the coaches really support me and give me good feedback.”
As action progressed, the Crimson offense became more fluid and by extension more dangerous as the team closed out the match by winning the two final sets.
“I think in the beginning we were struggling with our passing,” Zimmick said. “It was just really tough to get kills. We started to improve our passing and then the offense worked really well.”
The Laval offense needed no time to adjust to the volleyball, winning the first set, 25-21. Attacker Olivier Jannini provided a game-high 28 kills in a losing effort. Setter Marc-Andre Morency added 70 assists, but it was not enough to take down the visiting opponent.
Harvard’s defense was able to stay strong long enough to hold off the Laval attack. Madden and senior libero Chris Gibbons led the defensive effort with 11 digs apiece, with three others each adding at least seven.
Last time out, the Crimson fell behind after the third set and was unable to rally against No. 4 Long Beach State in the Asics Invitational final. On Wednesday, however, Harvard was able to fight back and secure its first victory of the season against its Canadian opponent.
“We came out pretty slow at the beginning,” Bendell said. “Towards the end of the match we started to pick up our play. Coach [Brian Baise] said that he was very pleased with ... [how] we never gave up.”
