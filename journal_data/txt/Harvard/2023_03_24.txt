After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Somewhere between the categories of soft porn, “Sex Education,” and health documentary lies a new Hulu series titled “Planet Sex with Cara Delevingne.” Billed as a docuseries, the show attempts to explore various facets of the human sexual experience from both clinical and cultural perspectives, but ultimately is only focused around the actress and model Cara Delevingne, who shares personal anecdotes and insights throughout the series. With a hand in the conceptualization and production of the show, Delevingne is truly at the heart of the work in ways that are both helpful and harmful.
The show’s scope is broader than it is deep, but it certainly touches on some wonderful topics. One is the show’s focus on pleasure and play in the sexual space, which is rounded out in an episode about the orgasm gap. Delevingne steps out of frame for a moment to allow Doctor Sura and the team at Mauj, a company dedicated to female pleasure — from its creation of a sex toy to its being a platform for women’s stories — to discuss their mission. Dr. Sura notes that stories of pleasure aren’t as easily and readily available in public discourse as stories of pain are in many Arab countries, and hopes that her work can have a positive influence.
But even as Delevingne does her best to be honest and aware of her privilege and to mitigate her role in the show, there is still a sense of inconstancy and continual tension that comes from her involvement. One of the wonderful things about the show is how it serves as a platform for a wide range of queer activists, doctors, artists, teachers, and thinkers all around the world. From sexologists and neurologists, to artists like Rokudenashiko, a sculptor from Japan, and The Darvish, a performance artist and community event organizer, space is made for a diverse set of voices and perspectives. However, with Delevingne as host and explorer, it still often feels as though the show is ultimately still centered around the perspective of a white, cis, and conventionally beautiful woman.
The show keeps things entertaining with a light, playful tone even as it handles deeply intimate subjects, though this perhaps prevents the conversation from diving deeply into any particular subject in a more meaningful way. Rolling Stone mentions the lack of discussion of sex work — and certainly the show steers clear of more controversial or complicated topics. But perhaps that’s not the point of this show. After all, talking about sex more in general can’t be a bad thing. And given the woeful state of sex education in the US, a show like this, which doesn’t go too deep but has an impressive breadth and sweep of topics in an approachable, accessible format, is doing no harm.
Overall, the show might be a laid back watch for the casual viewer (though they must be a big Cara Delevingne fan to truly enjoy), and certainly the introduction of more works that discuss sex in a positive and normalizing manner are a good thing. Delevingne’s charm and impish naivete are an accessible and fun introduction to sex education, but viewers looking for anything deeper will need to go elsewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March is marching by us with haste, but a report released earlier this month has given us pause. Think tank and polling firm Data for Progress, in collaboration with the Fossil Free Research campaign, claims that Harvard received at least $20 million from major fossil fuel companies between 2010 and 2020.
Regardless of its veracity, this claim disquiets us. It invites us to consider the dangers of donors influencing academic research. Foundational to Harvard University is a deep commitment to the truth. We live, breathe, and eat veritas — look at our buildings, gates, merchandise, and even waffles emblazoned with the motto. As a research institution, the principal incarnation of veritas here is our research. No funding should lead our researchers astray from their truth-seeking paths.
The relationships between donors, researchers, and entire departments create subtle networks of influence. Funding from fossil fuel firms and other unsavory companies may, intentionally or not, tug at these networks to produce research favorable to donor interests.
Harvard’s history offers examples of the powerful nature of these networks, even after the donation check clears. Jeffrey E. Epstein held longstanding ties with Harvard through millions of dollars worth of donations to our University. Epstein also cultivated tight relationships with some of our school’s chief administrators and premier intellectual experts, frequently hosting seminars that they would attend. That Epstein, who was not a faculty member, University affiliate, or even a College alumnus, held such close access to Harvard is alarming.
Epstein’s case may appear as an anomaly in terms of both closeness to Harvard and moral depravity of the donor. But broadly, much of undue donor influence seems hard to identify as such. We suspect misconduct often takes the form of propriety: a mere quid pro quo for a friend.
Analysts who worked on the report indicated difficulty collecting data on where specific donor money was spent, suggesting that the eyebrow-raising $20 million estimate may actually be a lower bound for the truth. This lack of financial transparency is an obstruction to veritas, and cannot continue.
We call on Harvard to develop a centralized database for tracking gifts. Given the large sum of donor money our school receives, information such as amount, source, and usage on all corporate donations should be publicly available — wherever such information can be legally disclosed. While privacy concerns may require that certain donors remain anonymous, the University ought to acknowledge industry connections of certain donors.
Building on top of this always accessible database should be regularly published reports that synthesize these granular individual donations into comprehensive conclusions. This is essentially what Data for Progress and Fossil Free Research did earlier this month, but the onus of accountability must be moved from these advocates onto the University itself. Integrity and truth are central tenets of the University’s research; it is their responsibility to uphold them.
Researchers, too, are obliged toward accountability in their pursuit of the truth. They should disclose funding-related conflicts of interests not only in each individual study, but also largely over their bodies of work and departments.
Transparency regarding our existing donations in tension with research is beneficial, but a more ethical funding framework simply wouldn’t create conflicts of interest in the first place. For future donations, the University should encourage donors not to earmark gifts for specific causes. This would allow the University to allocate funds and their attached names to departments in a way that is mindful of mitigating the pulls of influence exerted by donors.
Just as we thought an endowment investing in fossil fuels economically nonsensical for the future, we find climate change research funded by fossil fuels companies academically nonsensical. As a research institute devoted to veritas, there can be no interference by donations in our truth-seeking. The validity of our research is at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most people’s idea of a perfect lecture probably doesn’t involve holding back tears for a full hour — but when the thing you’ve been waiting for over the course of your college career finally comes to fruition minutes after you take your seat, sometimes it can’t be helped.
On February 1, an email from the director of the Asia Center elicited my own class-time encounter with this peculiar, salty joy. The news in my inbox? In the coming months, Harvard will hire a preceptor to teach Tagalog — the most-spoken language in the Philippines, the native tongue of my mother’s family, and the language, as I uncovered for The Crimson in December 2021, that Harvard affiliates leading the United States colonial education system in the Philippines once worked to suppress.
Harvard has existed for nearly four centuries — all of those years as a settler institution on unceded Native land, over a third of them as an active site of enslavement, and approximately a quarter of them as an observer of the legacy of the overseas colonial education system that it helped to establish.
Through administrators that bore its degrees, its pedagogical training, and its presidential seal of approval, Harvard designed and implemented a system of mandatory English-only instruction in the Philippines — ignoring contemporaries’ concerns that it would lead to cultural destruction and building the foundations for a pernicious, enduring form of internalized racism known as colonial mentality.
Yet for over 120 years following the U.S. invasion of the Philippines, which occurred concurrently with the installation of a Harvard graduate as the colonial superintendent of education, Harvard found no reason to offer the language of a country whose colonization helped launch the U.S. into its modern-day position as a global superpower.
Never mind that through the 1990s, Filipinos were the second largest immigrant group in the U.S. Never mind that today, Tagalog remains the fourth most-spoken primary language in the nation, following only English, Spanish, and Chinese. And never mind that students in the Harvard Philippine Forum spent years advocating for Tagalog courses, sending countless unanswered emails to the administration in what appeared to be the one exception to Harvard’s notable commitment to funding “obscure languages.”
The only possible reason for this lack of a reason is systematic ignorance: an inexcusable unawareness of the significance of Tagalog in the daily operations of this country, or a decontextualized false belief that Tagalog lacks use because most Filipinos also speak fluent English. This belief that an entire language — and all of its embedded memories, legends, worldviews, and possibilities — is of little to no value compared with English and thus permissible to mute has colonial precedent; its hypothesized role here is nothing new. For over 120 years, Harvard has perpetuated the same brand of ideological ignorance in the academic setting both at home and abroad, its manufactured silence spanning the Pacific, its halls reverberating outwards with deafening white noise.
***
In the weeks since I first received that fateful email, my processing of the news has taken place in parallel with preparation for Cultural Rhythms, Harvard’s oldest and largest multicultural production. Tomorrow, members of Harvard Philippine Forum will perform tinikling, a folk dance in which two dancers deploy strategic footwork between clapping bamboo poles.
Some say tinikling was inspired by the grace of the hopping tikling bird; others, the defiance of farm workers who learned to dodge bamboo-stick strikes to their ankles during the period of Spanish colonialism. Either way, it is one of the most popular dances in the Philippines and in the Filipino American community — a form of cultural articulation whose boisterous, joyous noise-making infectiously invites more.
My mother lost the angles of her mother tongue by the time she finished high school in Los Angeles; like many second-generation Filipino Americans — a group that in 2004 lacked heritage language fluency at a rate nearly 40 percent higher than the average across Asian immigrant groups — my inheritance was a mouth rounded by soft English words, assimilated, accentless.
But my mother taught me tinikling when I was seven, her old college costume of woven piña cloth loose over my girlish frame. I learned to dance where my tongue was severed, borrowing another form of language to graft on the space of the wound.
The diaspora is like this: a series of survivors’ translations, a making of music from shipwrecked tongues. Unable to speak Tagalog, I cannot name what was lost. But I have found other ways to speak — just as my mother did, and just as Filipino American scholars and students and advocates have for decades. Amid institutions filled with white noise, we articulate translation after translation to keep our heritage alive, audible if you know how to listen.
***
Harvard’s existence can be understood as both an overarching legacy and as a series of individual moments, including the present, within that legacy. This is how people can be harmed by what Harvard was, even if it is no longer — even if it repatriates the stolen artifacts, redresses the sinister ties, offers the severed language.
For groups experiencing the material and ideological effects of Harvard’s role in U.S. empire, when do present instantiations of the University outweigh its legacy?
I do not mean to suggest that we seek a return to a mythical pre-colonial essence; such an aim is not only impossible, but also misrepresentative of the ever-shifting nature of culture and identity. From a material standpoint, however, Harvard’s legacy is still largely a form of manufactured ignorance. Currently, only one course on the Philippines is offered at the College; Southeast Asia, made illegible between South and East Asian studies, entirely lacks a formal department; and the effects of Harvard’s pedagogy still linger noxiously in the transpacific setting, producing psychological scars that cannot easily be unmade.
The hiring of a Tagalog preceptor is a necessary first step; it is also just one instantiation in a legacy made of instantiations, one novel articulation in a century-long speech. So while I am undeniably elated by the news of Tagalog’s offering, I refuse to celebrate Harvard for a legacy it has yet to remake.
Instead, I celebrate those who made this current moment possible — those who have been gradually drowning out Harvard’s systematic white noise by speaking alternate tongues of resistance all along. I celebrate the students who argued with an apathetic administration for years, making the presence of the community audible through rhythm and dance even when Harvard refused to listen. I celebrate the alumni in the Philippines who raised support for the new position, amplifying the call for Tagalog until it was heard by the right people. I celebrate director James Robson and the staff at the Asia Center who worked to create an institutional space for Southeast Asia, translating a decades-long dream into decisive action.
And most of all, I celebrate the preceptor and students who, in the coming months and years, will give new voice to once-muted words. Articulated through angular tongues and joyous noise, their proud, boisterous Harvard is the one that I hope, someday, to celebrate.

Steven Levitsky is a Harvard professor of Government and Latin American Studies who serves as the director of the David Rockefeller Center of Latin American Studies. He co-authored “How Democracies Die” with fellow Harvard Government professor Daniel Ziblatt.
FM: You’re from Ithaca, New York, the college town of Cornell University. Was academia something you always knew you wanted to go into?
SL: My dad was a professor, and in my family, it was kind of taken for granted that you were supposed to get a Ph.D., which is pretty nuts. But that was the case. And so, I fought it for a while, I thought about journalism, I thought about other things, but it was always there.
FM: How did you come to study Latin America?
SL: I studied Spanish in high school. I’ve always been interested in politics, but I was attracted to Latin American politics in part because I spoke some Spanish, but in part because when I was roughly your age — late high school, early college — Central America was a very, very hot issue in the United States. It was the mid and late 1980s and there’d been a revolution in Nicaragua, there were civil wars in three of the five countries in Central America, it was front page news.
And I basically got initially involved more as an activist, someone who was critical of the Reagan administration’s policies in Central America, and then when I got to college, I was able to take some classes in Latin America and fell in love with the region.
FM: While you were at Stanford, you were involved in apartheid divestment protests against South Africa. What was that like? 
SL: It was how I cut my teeth in politics. It was my first activist issue. As a high school student, there were anti-apartheid or pro-divestment protests at Cornell, and so that was the first issue I ever got involved in.
As you get older, you realize the world is full of grays and not so many black and whites. And when you’re young, when you’re 17 or 18 or 19, you see the world in much more Manichean black white terms. It’s the pure good versus the pure evil, and as you get older, you realize things are much more complicated, but not that one. I mean, that was just really clear in terms of what was ethically right and what was ethically wrong.
FM: I’ve heard you’ve met Fidel Castro once. Can you tell me more about that?
SL: Early 2000s, we were invited to be a part of an observer mission at the Ibero-American Summit in Panama, the summit for all the Latin American presidents, and there was an incident in which a Cuban exile apparently tried to get in the country with a Salvadoran passport allegedly to try to assassinate Castro. And so there was a press conference, and my wife is a journalist and we used her press kit credentials and got into the press conference. And Fidel was in classic form, going on for hours and hours about what the CIA did in 1976 and just ranting for a very long time.
After the press conference, pandemonium broke out, and my wife and I were basically standing in a hallway and out of a crowd of people — it was as if the Red Sea had parted — and suddenly Fidel Castro was marching right towards me. Not because he wanted to see me, he just happened to be walking in my direction, and I stuck out my hand and said, “Hello,” and that was it.
FM: You went to college at Stanford and got your Ph.D. at Berkeley, but you’re now here at Harvard. Do you prefer the West Coast or the East Coast?
SL: I love the West Coast, I love the Bay Area, everything about it. That’s another reason why I think I really got into Latin American politics, because California’s connection to Latin America is so much stronger, particularly back then, was so much stronger than the East Coast. But I’m an East Coast guy. I grew up on the East Coast. My identity is more East Coast, my sports teams are from New York. So I was also very comfortable coming back home. This feels like home.
FM: In addition to being a professor, you’re the director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, which sponsors many opportunities for students to spend time abroad in Latin America. Why do you think it’s important for students to spend time abroad? 
SL: I have a real personal connection to that.
For me, I would not be doing what I’m doing today had it not been an opportunity as an undergraduate to go to, in my case, Central America, to travel to Latin America, to study Spanish, to do summer research for my thesis. My summer in the summer of 1989 doing senior thesis research in Managua, Nicaragua, changed my life. I mean, I’m doing what I’m doing today because of the opportunity I had in college to travel to Latin America.
FM: You’ve co-written books and articles with fellow Harvard Government professor Daniel Ziblatt. How did you guys become collaborators?
SL: Well, we met in graduate school. We both studied at UC Berkeley together. He arrived at Harvard a few years after me. But, since we already knew each other, and we both studied comparative politics, and we had some of the same professors at Berkeley, I think I probably got to know him better than some of my colleagues.
But what happened is when the 2016 presidential campaign started, he and I basically started having watercooler conversations, and we started talking in the hallway, or there used to be a cafeteria across the street in CGIS back before Covid.
During the campaign, we basically just started shooting the shit in the hallway and realized that what we were seeing early in the campaign was reminiscent to both of us of things we had seen in our own region, not in the United States, but him as a Europeanist who’s spent a lot of time studying the breakdown of democracy in Europe in the 1920s and 30s, me as a Latin Americanist, who had spent time studying the breakdown of democracy in the earlier periods in Latin America in the 60s and 70s. And we both felt, having very different experiences studying different parts of the world, that this was a movie that we’d seen before and that most Americans hadn’t seen.
I gave a lecture the day after the election, or two days after the election, and I didn't know what to say and I didn't want to be too partisan, and I decided not to say anything. And after that lecture, a student came up to me and just ripped the shit out of me and told me, “You need to see something, you’re an expert on democracy and you didn't say anything.”
So the next lecture, I gave a 20 minute mini lecture on what this means for American democracy, and that was a kernel of the op-ed that Daniel and I wrote, which eventually became the book “How Democracies Die.”
FM: I want to ask about “How Democracies Die.” Several chapters of it critically examined Donald Trump’s presidency, and it was published in 2018 in the middle of the Trump presidency and the year of the midterms. Was that timing intentional?
SL: What happened is neither Daniel or I ever imagined we would write that book. We did write an op-ed in the New York Times, right after Trump got elected. But we never thought about writing that sort of a book.
So what happened is after we wrote the op-ed, a book agent who Daniel just happened to meet a few months earlier reached out to Daniel and said, “You guys need to turn this into a book” and offered to help us put together a book proposal, which we did over Christmas break of 2016. This book agent saw the book way before we did, and she came up with the idea for the book and convinced us.
This was before the whole world was talking about a crisis of democracy in the United States.
So this idea that a couple of professors who study democracy think there might be a threat to American democracy was new, and so we kind of happened to be first. Soon after Christmas break, as soon as we got that book proposal together, publishers snatched it up and we signed a contract and then I think we had one year to write the book. And we just wrote the book as fast as we could.
So it came out in January 2018 because that was as fast as we could produce it.
FM: Even post-Trump, discourse about the fate of American democracy still circulates. Are you optimistic? 
SL: Well, actually, Daniel and I are writing another book. We’re finishing it up right now, and it will be out in October. It’s called “Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached The Breaking Point.”
It’s not terribly optimistic. I mean, it is very good news for American democracy that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and we are in better shape now as a result. Had he been reelected, I think we would have been in some serious trouble. But Daniel and I think — and we’re going to argue in this book — that some of the underlying conditions that caused the crisis of the last five years, they’ve not gone away.
In particular, the radicalization of the Republican Party continues, and some of our country’s very old institutions, which are very, very counter-majoritarian, much more counter-majoritarian than other established democracies in the world, are protecting and empowering what is essentially an authoritarian minority party. So the threat of another round of democratic crisis continues to be pretty high.
FM: You were an activist in college, what do you think college students can do to help preserve democracy, if anything?
SL: It’s a great question. I mean, of course, students can do things and there are many, many different ways to defend democracy and students should follow their own passions and beliefs.
The issue of voting — whether it’s efforts to register people, or to push for voting rights — I think continues to be, as it has been for more than two centuries, a critical issue for citizens to fight for. That’s just one, of course.
FM: You’ve taught the introductory Government class Gov 20: “Comparative Politics.” What do you hope the main takeaways for your students are?
SL: That is a fun class to teach because it’s mostly first-semester fresh-people. First-semester fresh-people are this great mix. I mean, they’re really smart, but they haven’t yet been socialized into the Harvard cool. So they still ask questions, they're not inhibited.
For every big question that we care about there are always two or three or four different ways to look at it, different ways of explaining it. And getting students to think critically, and be able to look at questions from multiple angles, and to think about two or three different competing explanations and try to figure out which explanation is most persuasive and most compelling, has the bulk of the evidence behind it, is a really important skill not just in social science, not just in political science, but in life.
FM: What are some ways you like to spend your time outside of the classroom? 
SL: I am a big sports fan for one. So whenever New York sports teams are on television, I’ll be there watching.
FM: What sports teams?
SL: I’m a big Mets fan in baseball. Rangers and Knicks. Little less in football, but a big big sports fan. My wife and I love to travel so whenever we get a chance we travel, trying to visit new countries everywhere in Latin America.
One hobby that probably most people don’t know I have is I’m a big bird watching fan. I like birds.
FM: Has studying declines in good governance been demoralizing? 
SL: Yes and no. Sometimes it is, when particularly countries that I know, and have lived in, have studied, and care about, when they experience democratic reversals it can be hard.
When I first started studying democracies in Latin America — and elsewhere in the world — it was the mid 1980s. And we continue to be in a much better place in the world today than we were back then. The reason I’m in this business, the reason I study democracy, is I had the fortune — I don’t know if it was good fortune or bad fortune — but the fortune, to be wandering around Central America in the 1980s and seeing firsthand what the absence of democracy is like. What authoritarianism, and military rule, and real human rights violations are like. What it’s like to not have democracy. And one, that has inspired me my whole life to work to find ways to make democracy succeed. But it also, it reminds me that even today, we’re in a much, much better place than we were back then. And, it reminds me that democracy is always a struggle. There always are setbacks. Democracy is always an unsettled system. It’s always going to be open to threats and so it requires a tireless fight.
FM: How do you stay motivated studying something that fluctuates so much, like democracy does?
SL: I think I have a smaller brain than many of my colleagues here. I don’t get bored that easily, just because I’m not that smart. But also, it truly goes back to the experience I had when I was your age.
I was in college, learning about democratization, just as Latin America was pulling out of its worst period of authoritarian rule. The 1970s and early 80s had been a terrifying period of authoritarian rule across most of the region. And I had the very, very, immensely good fortune of being taught by a generation of scholars and practitioners who lived through that period.
I learned from them, and for some reason I just never let those lessons slip away — they’re with me today. That, and the experience of actually visiting, as a very young, very, very naive kid, but seeing through my own eyes the effects of civil war and authoritarianism, for some reason that just never left me. It continues to get me out of bed in the morning everyday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will hire a preceptor to teach Tagalog, marking the first time the University will offer courses in the language.
The Department of South Asian Studies will hire three preceptors to teach Tagalog, Bahasa Indonesian, and Thai, for course offerings starting the 2023-24 academic year.
While Thai and Indonesian are currently taught at Harvard, no courses are offered in Tagalog, the fourth most spoken language in the United States.
The Harvard University Asia Center secured financial support for the positions through fundraising efforts, according to Executive Director Elizabeth K. Liao. The positions will be three-year term appointments for each preceptor and are renewable for up to five additional years.
James Robson, a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and director of the Asia Center, said the administration was able to get one million dollars from the Asia Center’s budget to fund the Tagalog preceptor position; however, he added that funding the position after three years would be “probably not entirely sustainable.”
“We’re very excited and hopeful that these positions will be a game-changer in terms of the Asia Center’s long-term mission to build Southeast Asian studies at Harvard, as well as the university’s engagement with the region,” Liao wrote in an email.
Currently, Harvard does not have a Southeast Asian Studies department. In the 2022-23 course offerings, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers one course on the Philippines, which is a survey course of the history of Southeast Asia.
Robson said the Asia Center has spent more than two years working to increase education about Southeast Asia at Harvard.
“What I’m hoping is that if we can demonstrate that there’s demand for these languages and students show up and are excited about it, then hopefully we can also use this to convince the administration to further support Southeast Asian studies generally and language instruction in particular,” Robson said.
Jorge Espada, associate director for Southeast Asia Programs at the Asia Center, said his team noticed a lack of Southeast Asian studies and language course offerings when they conducted a survey of all such resources at Harvard.
“Most Southeast Asian languages are taught as part of a tutorial format within the Department of South Asian Studies,” he said. “We wanted to see if we could have these languages taught by a preceptor-level position to professionalize the instruction, to make it more consistent, and to generate enthusiasm for it at Harvard.”
Eleanor V. Wikstrom ’24, co-president of the Harvard Philippine Forum and a Crimson Editorial chair, said getting Tagalog offered has been one of the goals for “as long as HPF has been in existence.”
HPF has petitioned Harvard administrators to offer courses in Tagalog, according to Wikstrom. In 2021, Wikstrom wrote an op-ed in The Crimson criticizing the lack of offerings in the Tagalog language at Harvard. She said she received pushback for her advocacy efforts and questions about the value of learning Tagalog.
“We’re working against a historical memory that is actively erasing the understanding of the importance of the Filipino-American relationship,” Wikstrom added.
HPF Co-President Marcky C. Antonio ’25 said securing Tagalog course offerings at Harvard was “a big win for the Filipino community back home,” adding that he hopes it will spur more academic exchanges between Harvard and the Philippines.
Although Antonio said he felt “elation” at the news of hiring a Tagalog preceptor, he also felt a “sense of hesitation.”
“While this is the first Tagalog language course that’s ever been offered in Harvard’s history, I think there’s also this sense that we need to make sure we teach this right — not only Tagalog language, but Filipino culture as a whole,” he said.
John U. Ficek ’25 said he wanted to learn Tagalog when he first arrived at Harvard, but he was “surprised” to learn that it was not offered. He said a Tagalog class would “help out a lot” for Filipino students who grew up in the U.S. and never learned the language.
“I think the Filipino heritage is very rich and very interesting, and I’m very proud to have that as my background,” Ficek said. “I’m looking forward to having other people learn about it.”
Aaron J. Arlanza ’26 said he was “grateful” and “relieved” to hear of the new preceptor position, saying it was important for Filipino representation at Harvard.
“I think that’d be a step in the right direction for elevating not only Filipino students here at Harvard, but also the influence that the Philippines and Filipino culture has here on campus,” Arlanza said.
Both Wikstrom and Antonio said they want to continue advocating for increased Filipino representation at Harvard.
“We have further responsibility to push this now that we know that this is possible,” Wikstrom said. “So we’re not going to stop at Tagalog.”

City leaders are taking steps to shake off Boston’s Puritan roots with the appointment of a nightlife director last month.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 appointed Corean Reynolds as Boston’s first director of nightlife economy in February, calling the new position a part of her administration’s plan to help the city’s economy bounce back from the challenges of the pandemic.
Reynolds took office on March 6 with an aim to increase business and diversity in Boston’s night scene. She previously served as the director of economic inclusion at The Boston Foundation, a nonprofit that supports philanthropic efforts in New England.
Boston’s downtown area — in contrast to its residential neighborhoods — has not seen a return to pre-pandemic levels of business due to remote work trends, depriving shops of foot traffic and revenue, according to the Boston Globe.
In an interview with WBZ-TV, Reynolds said she hopes to bring “more of Boston downtown,” referencing a goal to establish more small businesses characteristic of Boston’s neighborhoods in the center of the city.
Beyond problems associated with the pandemic, the city of Boston has long suffered from a perception of having poor nightlife, in part due to structural barriers to staying out late.
Most public transportation shuts down between 12–1 a.m., while state law forbids the sale of alcohol after 2 a.m. — which means most clubs in the city shut down at that time as well. By contrast, other cities such as New York and Chicago allow the sale of alcohol until 4 a.m.
Bill Svetz, a longtime bar owner who currently manages the pub Cathedral Station, said he is skeptical about the ability of a new “night czar” to address Boston’s nightlife reputation.
Svetz, whose business serves queer bar-goers in the historically gay South End, pointed to gentrification and rising costs of living as a major source of decline in the city’s LGBTQ+ nightlife over recent decades.
“It’s quite prohibitive to try to buy property in the South End anymore,” he said.
As a result, young LGBTQ+ people “don’t have the nightlife that we used to have 25 years ago,” according to Svetz.
As the cost of owning a business has risen, so have the expenses of going out in Boston, according to some students.
“The covers here are a little bit more expensive than Chicago,” said Amado D. Candelario ’24 — a Chicago native.
A.J. Veneziano ’23 — a Crimson Arts editor — said the cost of going to a club for a few hours is “way too much money.”
“Not to mention the drinks are vehemently overpriced,” he added.
At a Feb. 22 press conference, Reynolds said she supports calls for the expansion of late-night transportation options, especially in residential neighborhoods, though the MBTA itself falls under state — not city — authority.
“I’ve been stranded two or three times downtown Boston at 1 a.m. because the T stopped running, Ubers were way too expensive, and we weren’t even near a bus stop,” Veneziano said. “There are certainly infrastructure issues that I hope will be addressed.”
Candelario said public transportation shuts down early, which can lead to burdensome costs for alternative ways home, like costly ridesharing apps.
“It really discourages people when they’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t know how expensive this Uber back is gonna be,’” he added.
The result, Calendario said, is a hefty price for a night out with friends.
“You have to be prepared to spend 40 to 60 dollars on the Uber there and back, plus drinks, and if you’re choosing to buy stuff before you go,” he said.
Reynolds’ position falls under the Economic Opportunity and Inclusion Cabinet, tasking her with addressing the racial wealth gap in the city’s nightlife economy.
“You’re already seeing disparities in wealth when it comes to who can afford to go out versus who can’t,” Veneziano said. “I definitely think steps can be made towards diversifying the nightlife crowd because it is — specifically at these clubs — overwhelmingly white upper-class people which, in my opinion, inhibits a lot of the fun because it’s a crowd that I’m not a part of.”
“It can be fairly homogenous at times, and that’s just not fun,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg will step down as executive director of Harvard Hillel, the University’s Jewish center, at the end of this academic year after 12 years in the role.
During his tenure, Steinberg, a Harvard Chaplain, created the Harvard College Israel Trek program — which sponsors students to travel to Israel and the West Bank every spring break — in addition to a speaker series and the Harvard Torah Podcast.
In his email announcement, Steinberg wrote he was thankful for the opportunity to serve, adding that he felt confident in the organization’s future.
“The past dozen years, serving our students and our entire Harvard community, have been rewarding and deeply meaningful,” he wrote. “I am grateful to all involved, and I am confident of a wonderful path ahead for Harvard Hillel.”
Under Steinberg’s leadership, Harvard Hillel became a hub for Jewish programming and a strong voice on campus. Steinberg himself has been a staunch pro-Israel advocate on campus issues related to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
In the email, Steinberg praised the organization’s resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Our institution has led the field through the Coronavirus pandemic, with online programming that now continues to engage a global Harvard community even as our in-person community rebuilds and flourishes anew after the long period of campus closure and ‘social distancing,’” Steinberg wrote.
In a statement thanking Steinberg’s service, Lavea Brachman ’84 and Marc A. Cohen, co-chairs of the Harvard Hillel Board of Directors, wrote in an email announcement that Steinberg fostered a welcoming environment for a wide range of students.
“Jonah has been a leader in advancing the notion of Hillel as a ‘big tent’ on the Harvard campus where students with a variety of viewpoints — on topics ranging from Israel to religious practice, social justice to politics — can all feel comfortable calling Hillel their home,” they wrote.
Hillel’s board of directors will create a search committee this spring to conduct a national search for a permanent executive director to start serving in the 2024-25 academic year. In the meantime, the board will select an interim executive director to lead the organization during the 2023-24 academic year.
In an email to The Crimson, Harvard Hillel President Jacob M. Miller ’25 praised Steinberg as “a caring administrator, passionate leader,” and “a personal friend.”
“Steinberg has always been a steady advocate for the Jewish community with the Harvard administration, and, under his leadership, Hillel launched a capital campaign to raise funds for our building’s upcoming renovation,” wrote Miller, a Crimson Editorial editor.
“As a student leader, Jonah is always one phone call away, and is always prepared to teach me something new about Jewish culture or our nation’s history,” Miller added. “Jonah will be missed — by myself and the Harvard Hillel community as a whole.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Brown University student athletes have filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all present and former Ivy League athletes recruited since March 2019. Demanding a jury trial, the suit claims the eight Ivy League colleges unlawfully colluded to reduce financial aid and compensation for student-athletes.
Grace Kirk, a current member of Brown University’s women’s basketball team, and Tamenang Choh, a former member of the men’s team, filed the lawsuit March 7 in the U.S. District Court in Connecticut.
The plaintiffs claim the Ivy League Agreement is a “naked restraint of trade among horizontal competitors,” having “direct anticompetitive effects, raising the net price of education that Ivy League Athletes pay and suppressing compensation for the athletic services they provide” to their respective universities.
Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris defended the body’s practice of not offering athletic scholarships in a statement March 8.
“The Ivy League athletics model is built upon the foundational principle that student-athletes should be representative of the wider student body, including the opportunity to receive need-based financial aid,” Harris wrote.
“In turn, choosing and embracing that principle then provides each Ivy League student-athlete a journey that balances a world-class academic experience with the opportunity to compete in Division I athletics and ultimately paves a path for lifelong success,” Harris added.
Kirk and Choh contend Ivy League athletes are owed compensation for their service, alleging the League’s policy against offering athletic scholarships functions as an illegal price-fixing agreement which effectively denies athletes financial aid and fair payment.
“Regardless of whether considered as a restraint on the price of education, the value of financial aid, the price of athletic services, or the level of compensation to Ivy League athletes, the Ivy League Agreement is per se illegal,” the lawsuit reads.
They allege this agreement constitutes a breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 — a policy designed to protect “trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies.”
This is not Harvard’s first brush with the national debate regarding student-athlete compensation in college athletics. In 2019, former Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said he does not think student-athletes should be compensated for their participation.
“At Harvard, I do not think athletes should be paid. In a sense, they will be paid down the road, learning some great lessons that they use to pursue their lives in a meaningful way,” Scalise said in at 2019 interview.
“I believe people should come here to get an education, not just to play their sport,” he added. “You’re coming here to get an education. Athletics is part of it, but not the sole reason for you to be here.”
Later that year, the NCAA voted unanimously to enable student-athletes to be paid for the usage of their names, images, and likenesses.
“Here at Harvard, we believe strongly in offering athletics programming that is part of the educational experience, and is co-curricular rather than extracurricular,” Scalise told The Crimson shortly after the NCAA decision. “Education has always been our priority, and that will continue.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Agnes Callard, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, lectured on Socratic politics and freedom of speech at Harvard’s Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Ethics Thursday.
Callard, recently the subject of a viral profile in the New Yorker, delivered the third annual Mala and Solomon Kamm lecture in a hybrid format Thursday, attracting an in-person audience of more than 70. Callard was introduced by the ethics center’s director, University professor Danielle S. Allen.
“Plato and Aristotle both, in a variety of places, always noted that wonder is the origin of philosophy,” Allen said. “Agnes exemplifies a commitment to wonder, and to pursuing wonder wherever it may be.”
Throughout the lecture, Callard discussed her conception of politicization — the situation of language against the backdrop of social conflict — and its impact on free speech.
Callard referenced a 2022 New York Times op-ed on campus speech by then-college senior at the University of Virginia Emma Camp.
“Camp’s op-ed describes the experience of being silenced and bullied,” Callard said. “But when I read these words, I feel kind of bullied by them.”
“My problem is the language that Camp uses to describe the things universities ‘must do,’ what they ‘should refuse,’” Callard said. “I feel like someone is shouting, ordering you around.”
Callard said politicization has limited free speech, continuing to use the metaphor of bullying to represent political conversations.
“If you’re a friend of free speech, your advice to me is so often going to be, ‘Chill out, step back,’” Callard said. “You’re afraid I’m going to use my pain to shut you up.”
“Notice what is happening,” Callard added. “You’re starting to see me as your enemy. You need to make sure I don’t win any of these battles over language because if you give me an inch, I’ll take a mile. You can’t really listen to me because you have to guard yourself against me.”
Callard said politicization is the root cause of “polarized politics” in the U.S., adding that it is not properly recognized as a limitation of free speech.
“When we speak of ‘office politics,’ we’re using ‘politics,’ in the way that I’m using ‘politicized’ — we mean office infighting,” Callard said. “Even career politicians will say ‘let’s keep politics out of this,’ using ‘politics’ as a shorthand for what’s politicized.”
“They mean, ‘let’s temporarily suspend the usual practice of mapping every interaction onto a symbolic battlefield,’” Callard added.
Callard said Socratic principles can be used to illustrate problems with the liberal understanding of free speech, of which she identified five major tenets: government non-interference, a marketplace of ideas, tolerance, persuasion, and debate.
The coercive tendencies of persuasion and debate can serve to detract from open conversation, according to Callard, transforming the “exchange of words” into “an arena” for battle.
“That’s what Socrates calls eagerness to win — when each party escalates to ever more coercive language in a preemptive defense against being on the receiving end of the same, the conversation becomes politicized,” Callard said.
Callard added politicization hinders the ability to “hear the literal meaning” of words, undermining “the pinnacle of free speech.”
“Any time a scenario is structured in such a way as for there to be a winner and a loser, that reflects the presence of a symbolic layer on top of the facts,” Callard said.
Callard pointed to Socrates as a model for effective dialogue, commending his ability to “peel away the symbolism” to reach the truth. She added the “depoliticization of argument” is crucial to Socratic politics.
“There’s something tragic about people who are in a context where they don’t have freedom to inquire,” Callard said of contemporary discourse. “They’re not able to do anything but shout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The search for the next director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics has narrowed to an initial shortlist of four finalists, according to five people familiar with the student deliberations.
The finalists — former U.S. Representative Val V. Demings, former Transportation Secretary Anthony R. Foxx, former U.S. Representative Stephanie N. Murphy, and interim IOP Director Setti D. Warren — sat for interviews earlier this year with current and former IOP Student Advisory Committee members.
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf continues to search for a successor to former IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 after he unexpectedly departed in August 2022 to serve a second stint as president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
Foxx emerged as the clear favorite among the students after interviews with all finalists were completed, according to four people familiar with the deliberations. Despite demonstrating some unfamiliarity with the IOP, Foxx won students over with his enthusiasm for the role, the sources added.
Students ranked Demings’ candidacy as the weakest among the four candidates because of a perceived lack of clarity in her vision for the IOP, according to four people familiar with the deliberations.
HKS spokesperson Sofiya C. Cabalquinto declined to comment on the finalists or a timeline for the search.
Foxx and Demings did not respond to multiple requests for comment Thursday.
Murphy and Warren were both seen as viable candidates in students’ evaluations, ranking between Foxx and Demings, sources said.
Murphy did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
In an interview with The Crimson last month, Warren said he “would love to be the next director” of the IOP. Warren reaffirmed his desire to remain in the role full-time when asked about his candidacy Thursday afternoon.
All four finalists have served in elected office and boast resumes with lengthy careers in public service.
Foxx served as the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, before he was tapped to join President Barack Obama’s cabinet in 2013. Last spring, Foxx was a contender to lead the White House Office of Public Engagement in the Biden administration.
Demings, a four-term U.S. Representative from Florida, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in last November’s midterm election. Prior to entering politics, Demings worked in law enforcement for 27 years, becoming the first woman to serve as chief of the Orlando Police Department.
Warren served as mayor of Newton, Massachusetts, from 2010 to 2018, before he was hired as executive director of the IOP in 2021. After Gearan’s departure last summer, Warren was named IOP interim director.
Murphy, a three-term U.S. Representative, served as a member of the House’s Jan. 6 Select Committee and opted not to seek reelection last November to spend more time with her family. Before running for Congress, Murphy spent four years as a national security specialist for the U.S. Department of Defense.
In a December 2022 interview, Elmendorf explained that — unlike faculty appointments — the search for the next IOP leader does not involve a formal committee. Instead, Elmendorf is consulting with Kennedy School affiliates, undergraduates, and members of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee before making the final selection.
“We want a leader of the IOP who is very comfortable with senior public figures and very comfortable sitting in a dining hall, talking with students,” Elmendorf said in December.
“For the right person, that combination is just amazing,” he added. “But there are plenty of people for whom only one half of that would work.”

Harvard Medical School professor Michael E. Greenberg has won the 2023 Brain Prize for his decades-long research on brain plasticity, alongside University of Cambridge professor Christine E. Holt and Max Planck Institute Director Erin M. Schuman.
The Brain Prize is the world’s largest prize in neuroscience, first awarded by the Danish Lundbeck Foundation in 2011. The 2023 prize granted around $1.45 million to three researchers, including Greenberg.
Greenberg joined HMS in 1986 and served as chair of the Department of Neurobiology from 2008 to 2022. He received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Wesleyan University and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rockefeller University.
“Together, the Brain Prize 2023 winners have made ground-breaking discoveries by showing how the synthesis of new proteins is triggered in different neuronal compartments, thereby guiding brain development and plasticity in ways that impact our behavior for a lifetime,” Richard G.M. Morris, chair of The Brain Prize selection committee, said in a press release.
Brain plasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt in response to new information throughout life, allowing the brain to function over the course of decades. Greenberg’s research centers on understanding how the brain responds to external signals and life experiences to regulate genes that make proteins required for brain plasticity.
“Mike’s elegant research highlights the power of basic discovery as the most essential fuel for scientific progress,” said HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82. “His impressive accomplishments, which now include this wonderful accolade, show just how much is possible when researchers unwaveringly follow their curiosity and scientific passions.”
When working as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Edward Ziff, then a professor of biochemistry and neural science at New York University School of Medicine, Greenberg discovered that within minutes of stimulation from the outside, a mammalian cell begins expression of a gene called c-fos, which increases production of the Fos protein.
According to Greenberg, the speed of this induction indicated a possible mechanism by which nature and nurture work together to orchestrate brain plasticity.
“For many years, I’d say we encountered a lot of skepticism,” Greenberg said during a press briefing. “How could a protein acting in the nucleus affect the faraway synapses that were thought to encode the memories?”
As an assistant professor at HMS, Greenberg found a connection between neurotransmitters and changes in gene activity. He characterized a signaling cascade in which an upstream neuron’s release of neurotransmitters could cause a calcium influx and eventual gene expression change in the nucleus of a downstream neuron through activation of transcription factors like Fos.
According to Greenberg, this demonstrated that Fos functioned as a “sort of master regulator.”
“It works to turn on a complex program that includes many additional proteins that act at synapses and modify synaptic function in a myriad of ways,” Greenberg said. “I think what’s striking is that many components of this neuronal activity dependent pathway of gene regulation, when mutated, lead to development disorders of the brain.”
Greenberg’s work lends insight to the origins of developmental brain disorders where neural plasticity mechanisms are damaged, such as Rett syndrome and autism.
“I think our work and the work of many others, coupled with the possibilities for gene therapy, really give us hope for real therapeutic advance,” Greenberg said. “I’m very optimistic about this, but it requires hard work and many years of effort.”
At the press briefing, Greenberg said he would use the money to visit his fellow recipients Holt and Schuman in Europe.
“I probably will try to think of some good causes that I could devote some of the prize money to and maybe in general, a little more travel than I’ve been doing to places around the world that I haven’t been,” he added.

Harvard Law School announced an expansion to the Low Income Protection Plan, a debt-assistance program for alumni pursuing public interest careers.
LIPP will now provide complete relief from loan repayments for alumni earning less than $70,000 annually, an increase of $15,000 from the previous floor, the school announced March 9.
The change, which will take effect on July 1, comes after calls by alumni and students to improve LIPP, including a letter last month demanding the Law School make an “express commitment” to specific changes to the program by March 1.
Combined with a previous increase in the contribution floor from $48,000 to $55,000 last May, this most recent change will mean LIPP’s floor has risen 45 percent in the last two years.
In addition to changing LIPP, the Law School announced a new loan repayment option for alumni that would supplement the federal government’s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which erases student debt after 10 years of public service work — by allowing those in eligible jobs to earn $110,000 annually without owing loan payments.
Brendan Schneiderman, a 2021 HLS graduate and advocate for changes to LIPP, said the expansion will provide a “tremendous amount of relief.”
But Schneiderman added other issues with LIPP and financial aid raised by students and alumni have still not been addressed by the Law School.
“There was no mention whatsoever of the burden that international students have who are not eligible for federal loans oftentimes,” he said.
He also raised concerns about how LIPP considers spousal income and assets held by participants as part of aid calculations, points raised in the February open letter he co-authored.
HLS spokesperson Jeff Neal referred back to the Law School’s press release regarding the changes to the program in response to a request for comment.
Previously, Neal has pointed to the program’s consideration of “extenuating circumstances” when calculating aid. Peer institutions consider spousal income and assets, Neal has also noted.
Schneiderman said he expects the updates to LIPP to motivate students and alumni to advocate for further changes.
“Even people who were skeptical have now seen firsthand what the power of organizing really is,” he said. “And so I think as we continue to push for some of these other changes, the effort is only going to grow.”
When he first heard the announcement about LIPP’s expansion, Schneiderman said he was “overcome with gratitude for all the people who have stayed the course.”
“There are people who are not yet on LIPP but expect to be, and this is going to make their lives a lot easier too,” he said. “It’s a touching outcome.”

Clients and former admissions mentors are still seeking refunds, compensation, and answers more than six months after the acquisition of college consulting startup Acceptitas, which cut ties with its mentors in late 2022, leaving many unpaid and unaware of their termination for months.
Emmet A. Halm — a self-described Harvard dropout and cryptocurrency entrepreneur — founded Acceptitas in August 2020, only to leave the company’s mentors and mentees in the dark two years later after its acquisition by another college consulting group, Crimson Education.
Halm announced the acquisition to employees in an Oct. 24 Slack message — two months after the move had already taken place.
“There will be new opportunities for Acceptitas team members to expand the scope of their work,” Halm wrote. “Mentors & outreach associates will have the chance to continue similar work under Crimson.”
Five former Acceptitas mentors who spoke with The Crimson, however, said they never heard anything further about future work. Some continued to meet with their mentees for months, unaware that they would not receive payment.
“We weren’t getting paid anymore,” former Acceptitas mentor Elias E.Q. DeLeon ’23 said. “And it was just very odd to see everyone just be so radio silent, especially after such a seemingly triumphant moment, like getting acquired as a company.”
“He didn’t say anything would change, really — everyone just kind of kept going on as usual,” said former mentor Jara A. Wilensky ’24, who continued to work with her mentee for three months. “They just stopped paying us.”
In a March 7 statement to The Crimson, Halm said Acceptitas connected those who requested it to Crimson Education for “similar roles,” and he denied any wrongdoing.
“Only one of our mentors messaged me indicating interest in continuing with the new company, so I put them in contact. Everyone else continued wrapping up hours with clients,” Halm wrote.
Halm wrote in the statement that “no one was fired; the company was acquired.”
“Mentors finished up the remaining hours with their clients and Acceptitas didn’t take in any new clients,” he wrote.
On Feb. 22, Halm posted in the Acceptitas Slack for the first time since October.
“We’ve sent several mentor payments over the last two months that previously fell through the cracks,” Halm wrote. “If anyone still has outstanding hours, please let me know asap.”
Former Acceptitas mentor and Stanford undergraduate Enrique Flores said the Slack message contained “no acknowledgement” of the hours mentors spent trying to reach Halm following the acquisition, nor of the harm from Halm’s “absence of communication.”
“They did not fall through the cracks,” Flores said. “You ignored them.”
In August 2022, Acceptitas was acquired by Crimson Education. Co-founded by Jamie J. Beaton ’16, Fangzhou Jiang, and Sharndré Kushor, Crimson Education is a global college consulting company, operating on a similar premise to Halm’s start-up.
On its website, Crimson Education advertises “former Admissions Officers, Ivy League and other top school graduates” among its college consultants.
By late September, Halm had started listing himself as the “former founder of Acceptitas” on his personal LinkedIn profile, though mentors had not yet been informed of the acquisition.
Halm wrote in a March 7 email to The Crimson that he could not discuss the terms of the acquisition by Crimson Education due to a nondisclosure agreement.
Desiree A. Rickett ’24, Acceptitas’ chief operating officer at the time, contacted Halm on Sept. 20 about refunds to mentees that had bounced and asked why the company’s Calendly subscription had lapsed.
“We’re having problems sending out money on the PayPal,” Rickett wrote in a text message obtained by The Crimson. “I’m trying to refund a client, but it keeps coming back as the bank refused the payment (our bank I believe).”
On Sept. 21, Halm responded, revealing the acquisition to Rickett.
“Hey Desiree, you can pause actions on PayPal. Acceptitas is being acquired by Crimson Education. This is not public information yet, so please keep on the DL (don’t tell mentors or clients yet),” he wrote in a text.
“This means we’ll be ceasing operations & transitioning folks to new exciting (& higher paid!) opportunities at Crimson,” Halm wrote.
Rickett reached out to Halm again on Sept. 21 about what to communicate to clients expecting refunds. Halm responded on Sept. 22, writing, “Nothing atm — more announcements to come soon.”
“Just don’t respond yet — I can reach out soon,” he added.
Halm asked Rickett to compile a list of payments owed to mentors and refunds owed to clients. Rickett shared it with Halm on Sept. 28.
In the following month, Rickett asked Halm at least five times about refunds he missed from the list.
She followed up with Halm on Oct. 22 about what to do with a client who paid the company $2,400 “a few weeks ago and has not heard back.”
“Moving funds around rn to refund him,” Halm wrote at 3:14 p.m. that afternoon.
“You can stop replying to Acceptitas related emails (company doesn’t technically exist anymore),” he added.
When Halm announced the acquisition of Acceptitas by Crimson Education in October, he requested mentors “keep this information confidential until our press release in the coming weeks.”
Neither Crimson Education nor Acceptitas published a press release on the move, however, leaving Acceptitas clients in the dark.
“If you have specific questions or want to indicate strong interest in taking on new roles & responsibilities, please message me,” Halm added.
Mentors at Acceptitas worked as independent contractors, rather than employees of the company. The Crimson obtained three copies of mentors’ contracts, which included a two-year noncompete clause and a termination clause.
“This agreement may be terminated by either party upon 15 days of written notice to the other party,” the contract states.
Halm’s Oct. 24 announcement did not include any reference to the termination of mentors’ contracts or the discontinuation of their work with clients.
“It seemed like we were being acquired, but nothing else was gonna change,” Flores said. “Like, we were just gonna continue doing the same services, but through Crimson Education. That was kind of it.”
But Crimson Education did not take on mentors’ contracts, according to the company’s U.S. director, Kimberly Scott.
Scott wrote in a Feb. 27 statement that Halm retained full responsibility for Acceptitas mentors and their payment following the acquisition.
“Crimson acquired only specific Acceptitas assets as part of the transaction,” Scott wrote. “The employees and contractors of Acceptitas remained as the sole responsibility of the original founder.”
Halm wrote in the March 7 statement to The Crimson that there had been no terminations, and referred back to the Slack announcement.
“No one was terminated; the company was acquired and mentors finished up the remaining hours with their clients,” Halm wrote. “We just stopped taking in new business.”
On Dec. 26, Amy Xiao, a junior at Brown University, reached out to Rickett on the Slack channel asking how to formally submit their resignation because they no longer had the time to mentor.
“Hi! Emmet didn’t make this super clear, but the company no longer exists because you are technically ‘resigned,’” Rickett wrote in response.
When Xiao asked if mentees had been informed of the company’s acquisition, Rickett wrote, “I don’t think so.”
DeLeon said he considered no longer being employed by Acceptitas a “theoretical possibility” when he read Halm’s Slack message. Still, he discarded the thought.
“I’ve heard, like, quiet quitting,” DeLeon said. “But this is like a quiet firing.”
In the months following Acceptitas’ acquisition, five mentors reported repeatedly failing to get in contact with Halm over missed payments.
Wilensky said she “didn’t think much” of the October acquisition announcement, and continued mentoring for five more sessions, which would total $150 in pay.
In a Jan. 7 meeting with one of her mentees, Wilensky said her mentee asked if the rumors were true — that Acceptitas was no longer paying its mentors.
“What are you talking about?” Wilensky asked her mentee at the time.
After trying to contact Halm through the company email, Wilensky received Halm’s personal email from the client’s parents, who were considering legal action.
It would ultimately take a month of Slack messages and emails to Halm for Wilensky to receive her payment on Feb. 2.
By the end of October, Flores had completed eight sessions with mentees, amounting to $240 in pay, and had not received any compensation for them.
After three weeks without payment, Flores informed his mentees that he would no longer be able to work with them. The payment issues coincided with a critical period in the college early application process, with many application deadlines set for Nov. 1.
“As I was trying to send messages to the Slack about getting paid, I was more patient and trusting because I didn’t want to just cut him off right before he had to apply to his number one school,” Flores said of his mentee.
On Nov. 7, Flores messaged the Slack channel but received no response. On Nov. 18, he messaged again.
“So, should I assume we are just no longer getting paid? Because I’ve yet to have someone reach out,” Flores wrote.
On Nov. 25, after receiving Halm’s personal phone number from another mentor, Flores texted him directly and did not receive a response.
Flores followed up on Nov. 28, but the silence continued.
Rickett texted Halm later that day about Flores’ outstanding wages.
“I have it on the amounts owed spreadsheet, did you happen to already send it out to him?” she asked.
After messaging Rickett on Dec. 2 and Dec. 7 with no response, Flores messaged her on Slack on Dec. 11.
“Hi Desiree, I feel I have been rather patient and have yet to hear anything,” Flores wrote. “I have detailed what has been happening with Acceptitas with my parents, and they are considering taking legal action.”
“I genuinely don’t understand why paying your workers has been such a struggle for you all, but it is unacceptable,” he added.
On Dec. 26, three weeks after Flores had first privately messaged Rickett, she responded by saying that she hadn’t “gotten an answer from Emmet in a while.”
Ricket offered to send Halm’s phone number, writing, “I don’t know what to tell you.”
“I haven’t had access to the bank account for months and he isn’t answering calls/emails/texts,” she added.
Flores reached out to Halm again on Feb. 13 — this time through Halm’s personal email.
“I have been trying to get a hold of you about payment for my time at Acceptitas and was informed that this is a better email to contact you with,” he wrote.
“I would like to be paid as soon as possible, considering it has been over 4 months,” he wrote.
On Feb. 14, more than two months after Flores’ initial outreach, Halm responded via email.
“Sent — hope your semester is going well,” he wrote.
Seven minutes after Halm published his Feb. 22 Slack message encouraging mentors to reach out about outstanding compensation, DeLeon emailed Halm regarding payment. He never received a response.
DeLeon’s last payment from the Acceptitas PayPal account is dated Oct. 11, 2022. He said he is still awaiting payment for 2.5 hours of work.
“I wouldn’t call it late payments. I’m technically still owed $70 in payment,” DeLeon said. “So it’s not necessarily late, it just also dropped off the face of the earth.”
Former Texas Assistant Attorney General Kerry V. O’Brien, who specializes in labor and employment law, said mentors “could expect and demand” to be paid on the same regular payment schedule of the contractual relationship, “regardless of the absence of anything specific in the contract.”
DeLeon said Acceptitas seemed like a “typical Harvard startup.”
“And even when it may not have the legs, it’s a bunch of people our age trying to act, to actually be CEO, COOs, that kind of stuff,” DeLeon said. “It’s a lot of pressure, and a lot of things can fall through the cracks in terms of professionalism and workflows.”
Minhyuk “Danny” Youn — a high school junior living in South Korea — learned about Acceptitas through TikTok in early 2022, during his sophomore year.
He paid $1,449 up front for a 30-hour mentoring package, but he took a break from Acceptitas in April 2022 due to difficulty coordinating meetings across the time difference.
Youn decided to switch to a professional college consultant in South Korea after completing 10.5 hours with his mentor. At that point, he still had 19.5 hours left in his package, valued at $941.85.
After deciding to terminate his mentorship with Acceptitas, Youn reached out to his mentor for a refund on the remaining hours. In a Nov. 27, email the mentor informed Youn that “I effectively no longer work at the company.”
“I was like, ‘What about my remaining money?’ ” Youn said.
Youn reached out to Crimson Education’s headquarters in South Korea and the United States and said he sent around 40 emails to Acceptitas and his mentor.
Eventually, Youn said he asked his parents for help in the matter and told Halm that “legal actions may follow” if the team continued to be “nonresponsive.”
Youn ultimately received his refund in early February. Still, he had to cover the cost of the PayPal fee for the payment, which totaled 4 to 5 percent of the amount owed.
Halm did not respond to a request for comment on the fee.
On Aug. 16, Amit Mathur purchased 20 sessions with a mentor, totaling $1,700, to help his ninth-grade son explore a passion project. After two sessions, Mathur emailed Rickett to request a mentor change in September, citing dissatisfaction with the emphasis on college admissions.
After a month without a new mentor, he emailed Rickett on Oct. 31.
“I am not feeling comfortable with the current state of events in your organization,” Mathur wrote. “Is it possible to get refund?”
“No worries! I will forward you along to Emmet who can get that processed for you,” Rickett responded on Oct. 31.
Mathur followed up with Rickett and Halm on Nov. 8 and again on Jan. 10, 2023, to ask about the refund. Mathur said he has still not received a refund.
Halm wrote in the March 7 statement that “all client requests were either handled by management or forwarded to me as appropriate.”
“I think they are using the Harvard name as a clickbait,” Mathur said.
“See, I believe they are kids,” Mathur added. “But if they’re trying to pull a fast one on people, that’s not good.”
When Harvard’s campus shuttered due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Halm took a gap year and built Acceptitas, which marketed itself as “founded 100% by Harvard students.”
Undergraduate mentors would meet virtually with high school students around the world, helping them develop “passion projects,” providing feedback on application essays, and guiding them through the college admissions process.
Halm hired Arin J. Mishra — then a sophomore in high school — as an unpaid intern in February 2020. Mishra would later become the company’s paid head of marketing. Halm hired Sarah J. Benedict, at the time a recent high school graduate, as chief operating officer in August 2021.
“When you’re at an institution like [Harvard] and you’re starting a company, you’re going to try to use its name as much as you can,” Mishra said.
“You can look at our earlier advertisements, and it’ll say, ‘Harvard students helping you with your application.’ It’s a dream come true,” he added.
After an initial free consultation, Acceptitas paired high school students with undergraduate mentors. Students could purchase packages of sessions — paying for up to 30 hours upfront.
As Acceptitas expanded, mentors were paid between $20 and $30 an hour based on how many clients they took on — a way to incentivize mentors to accept more clients. Benedict said the number of clients a mentor could work with at one time was capped at six.
Mentors signed independent contractor agreements with Acceptitas, but Rickett and Benedict — who were in operational roles — said Halm did not provide them with a legal contract.
Benedict said she directly asked Halm for a contract but never received one. Halm did send Benedict an IRS 1099 form for tax purposes — typically filed for independent contractors — and a nondisclosure agreement, she added.
“I can’t see a reasonable scenario in which somebody who is the COO in title, form, and function is properly an independent contractor,” O’Brien, the employment attorney, said.
Halm did not respond to a request for comment on the Acceptitas’ COO being an independent contractor.
Halm denied that he did not provide executive-level managers with contracts in a March 7 email to The Crimson.
“This is objectively false,” Halm wrote. “All our exec-level positions have clearly defined & signed formal contracts.”
Halm attached as evidence a screenshot of a Google Doc, last edited April 26, 2022, listing “COO responsibilities,” including “immediate tasks,” “future tasks,” and a to-do list. The screenshot also showed base pay for the position as $600 per month, with a bonus of 5 percent of gross revenue — though no other employment terms are referenced.
The screenshot Halm provided did not show a signature by Halm or any Acceptitas executive on the document.
“I definitely wasn’t paid $600/month,” Rickett wrote when asked about the terms included in the document. She wrote that her compensation rate remained $30 per hour even after transitioning to COO.
Halm did not respond to subsequent requests for comment on the COO contract or compensation, and he did not respond to a request to provide a signed copy of the document.
Halm posted an application for Acceptitas’ “Moonshot Internship” on his personal LinkedIn profile on Jan. 3, 2022.
“If you know any entrepreneurial-minded high school or college students, applications are open,” Halm wrote in the post. “Intern(s) will receive mentoring & a unique chance to lead their own start-up initiative.”
Julie T. Phan first learned of Acceptitas’ internship program through one of the company’s Instagram posts. Phan, who attends a Title I public high school, said she found Acceptitas and its mission “really inspiring.”
Phan completed Acceptitas’ social media internship application through a Google Form. On March 23, 2022, she received an interview request from Mishra, identifying her as an “exemplary applicant.”
But Phan did not hear back after replying to the request for an interview. She followed up on April 5, 2022, but she still did not receive a response.
And then, on May 12, 2022, Phan received unexpected news.
“Welcome to Acceptitas!” Mishra wrote in an email to Phan and 21 other students. Though Phan joined the company Slack, and Mishra’s email promised a Zoom call with the full intern cohort, Phan said she and the other interns received no further communication or direction.
“I poured my whole soul into the application — whatever I do, when it involves students and community — I value that the most,” Phan said. “And so, when I didn’t hear anything back, I felt really confused and disappointed.”
Mishra, who was tasked with interviewing prospective interns, confirmed that no interns were actually brought on.
“That’s on my end completely. I mean, I’ll take accountability,” Mishra said when asked why he did not follow up with Halm on the future of the internship program.
On Feb. 12, 2023, Phan sent a message in the Acceptitas Slack channel inquiring about the state of the internship program, writing, “I took my time to apply, got in, and didn’t receive any future updates.”
The response was not what Phan had hoped.
“Since Acceptitas basically doesn’t exist anymore/no one is employed anymore, I’m going to guess the internship doesn’t exist anymore,” Xiao, the former mentor, said.
“Sorry you got ghosted too — super unprofessional,” they added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a difficult start to the season, the Crimson has hit pace with three wins in its past four games. A strong starter to spring break, the Crimson traveled to Worcester, Mass. to play Holy Cross and notched its first win on the season with a 15-12 scoreline. Familiar standouts, the junior pair of attackers Riley Campbell and Callie Hem, led the attacking domination with four goals each on the day. The Crimson did not stop there, with flying attacking threats from first-year stars Hannah Shiels and Kate Gilliam.
Harvard traveled south with this momentum to play Coastal Carolina for a Tuesday matchup. Despite being on away turf, the Crimson led the charge from the start with senior standout Shea Jenkins notching a first-career goal on a spectacular run dicing through CCU opponents to rocket a shot just 12 seconds into the game. The Crimson’s strong play continued throughout the 60 minutes, edging past CCU in shots, saves, and draw controls.
Harvard has been extremely powerful off the draw despite the loss of senior Grace Hulslander due to injury. Junior midfielder Maddie Barkate has seamlessly stepped up and dominated on the draw, especially in the team’s most recent win against Holy Cross. Barkate reached a career-high of 12 draw controls as well as two goals, demonstrating her versatility and adaptability for the Crimson this season.
The Crimson have shown this resilience and response to adversity as a team, and that is something Coach Wills has emphasized from the start.
“I was really proud of how the team battled both in Holy Cross and in Coastal. We didn’t play a perfect game by any means. However, we found a way to regain momentum when the other teams went on a run,” Wills noted.
Sophomore midfielder Charley Meier emphasized how important it has been for the team to control momentum and not let the heat of the game affect large swings in possession against the Crimson.
“One of the biggest things in lacrosse is that it is a game of runs. It comes down to who can capitalize on runs — who can score the most off of them or who can prevent the other team from going on those huge runs,” Meier commented. “We have been trying to work on managing a lot when we get down by one or two goals, not shifting our morale or spiraling.”
The Crimson managed just that — maintaining scores on the board and managing energy throughout the respective games against CCU and Holy Cross.
“Several players stepped up at the right time. In Holy Cross, we had some critical goals at the right time from Ilana Kofman and in Coastal from Caroline Mullahy. Charlotte Hodgeson had a big game at Coastal and Maddie Barkate has really been leading our draw team,” Coach Wills said. “Further, in Holy Cross, Chloe Provenzano went in and honestly was a momentum shifter for us in the cage.”
The success on the field comes from a strong desire to improve the details in practice, according to junior midfielder Ilana Kofman.
“We try to focus on ourselves with the film and the drills we do focusing on what we need to build as a team,” Kofman reflected. “Our coaches focus on our game and what we can improve which I really like and I think it helps us not focus on what the other team is doing but lead on the field.”
The Crimson has sharpened this mentality of putting the team first and focusing on its potential as opposed to the outside noise — a task that most teams do not realize until much later in the season towards post-season play. Meier spoke to the quality of technical improvement in addition to this mentality that has helped the team going forward.
“We are trying to work on our zone and be like a forcefield where we are a huge unit working together. We have been doing a lot of 1v1s and zone work to be able to hold the dodges a lot stronger,” the midfielder said.
The work on the field, coupled with a fresh mentality going into the season post-break, is essential for Coach Will’s team with a string of important Ivy games looming in the near future. The Crimson looks to come back from two Ivy league losses, most recently last Saturday to Penn at home, and flip their fortune in the league away at Dartmouth on April 1. With defending champions Princeton coming off an Ivy League loss to Yale, no team is guaranteed a title, and competition is heating up in the Northeast.
The Crimson sealed off its third win emphatically last night against Merrimack, 20-2, with Hem tacking on five more goals to her already-20 on the season, making her total of 25 goals a team-high. Big contributions by Campbell, first-year Charlotte Hodgson, and sophomore midfielder Caroline Mullahy added greatly to the win and confidence heading into Dartmouth next weekend. The Crimson are firing on all cylinders, and hope to take that momentum to make an impact in Ivy League play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team continued its uneasy start to the 2023 season in a series against Texas A&M this past weekend, dropping its fourth consecutive series so far this year. The Crimson, having traveled to Florida to face Florida Atlantic University (FAU) earlier in the week, took a trip down to Corpus Christi in Texas for another road series.
Matching up for four games against the Aggies, Harvard hit a season-low point, losing its March 16 opener 24-3 and extending its longest losing streak of the season to eleven games.
Bouncing back for Friday's doubleheader, Harvard played more competitive ball after losing the first game 5-4, finally breaking the losing streak at 12 games with a 7-3 victory later that day.
After Friday’s uplifting win, the Crimson wasn’t able to build any more momentum, as Texas A&M closed the door on Harvard in the series’ final game, with the Crimson falling 5-3 and bringing its season record to (2-14) overall.
Having played all its games on the road thus far and finding success sparingly, the Crimson will hope to alter its away game formula before traveling to Philadelphia, Pa. to begin Ivy League play against the University of Pennsylvania.
“We have a good club and we haven't played well for whatever reason,” head coach Bill Decker said.  We gotta rally within and play for one another and hopefully we’ll see better results moving forwards.”
Game 1:  Harvard 3, TAMCC 24 // 7 Innings
The Crimson bats were alive in the first inning of Thursday’s opener against Texas A&M.  Leadoff hitter junior Peter Messevery opened the inning by ripping a single on the first pitch of the game.  After two quick strikeouts by George Cooper and Ben Rounds, senior clean-up hitter Logan Bravo swept Messervy off first base and into home plate, homering to right center to put Harvard up 2-0 before third baseman Jake Berger struck out to end the inning.
Unfortunately, the Aggie bats exponentially outweighed anything Harvard could put forward for the rest of the game. Scoring a run off a wild pitch in the bottom of the first, Texas A&M scratched the scoreboard in the first, cutting the Crimson’s short-lived lead to 2-1 to end the first inning.
Harvard entered and exited the top of the second in 1-2-3 fashion, grounding out twice before senior Hunter Baldwin struck out swinging to send the Crimson back into the field.
First-year Callan Fang, after making two strong appearances against FAU, struggled with control during his start against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.  Fang threw his second of four wild pitches on the day during the second early in the bottom of the second, allowing Texas A&M’s Christian Smith Johnson to advance to second plate after hitting a single off Fang.  With a runner in scoring position, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi proceeded to slash a trifecta of singles to drive in two runs, finishing the second by taking the lead for the first time in the game at 3-2.
The Crimson underwent another quiet inning at the plate in the third, with the exception of Senior George Cooper reaching base on an error before being left stranded at first. The Aggies came up flat as well, leaving the third inning with a 3-2 lead on Harvard entering the fourth.
The top of the fourth saw the Crimson get runners in scoring position on a quick from Logan Bravo, a walk by junior third baseman Jake Berger, and a wild pitch that moved both runners into scoring position on second and third. Three straight strikeouts vanquished any hopes the Crimson had of capitalizing on this opportunity.
Things headed south fast for the Crimson in the bottom of the fourth. Fang continued to struggle with control early in the inning, walking a runner and throwing another wild pitch before an error by Berger opened the door for Texas A&M-Corpus Christi to score their fourth run of the day.  Leaving a man on first, Fang was replaced by senior James Kirkpatrick with one out in the inning. In a blur, Texas A&M began an offensive onslaught on Kirkpatrick, scoring six runs before the Harvard pitcher was pulled without retiring a single batter. On the day, Fang finished the game with 3.1 IP and 5 ER, while Kirkpatrick was replaced by senior Pryor Thomas, ending the day with 0 IP and 5 ER.
The Crimson had another tough inning at the plate in the fifth, with three quick outs leaving Messervy stranded on second.
The runs continued to pile up for Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in the bottom of the fifth, as Thomas had no better luck than his predecessors in retiring Texas A&M-Corpus Christi batters, allowing five more runs and pushing the score to 15-2 for the Aggies.
Harvard had a brief upwind in spirit in the top of the sixth, with Junior Chris Snopek hitting the Crimson’s first home run of the game and cutting the deficit to 15-3.
When the Crimson took the field, Texas A&M didn’t take its foot off the brake — Using an assortment of pitchers, Harvard allowed nine runs in the bottom of the sixth, exiting the inning with Texas A&M-Corpus Christi leading 24-3.
The Crimson ended the game early without another score in the seventh inning by slaughter rule.
Game 2: Harvard 4, TAMCC 5
Harvard rebounded to play a wire-to-wire game on Friday night, losing in crushing fashion on a walk-off by Texas A&M in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Putting Thursday’s game in the past, Decker emphasized the team’s ability to “have a little bit of resilience” being “able to move on or this game will get to you”.
Bats blazing, the Crimson began the game with a bang. After Messevery reached first on a single out of the leadoff hole on a walk, Junior outfielder Ben Rounds cleared the fences on the next at-bat on an (0-1) count, putting Harvard up 2-0. Senior Logan Bravo also reached base on a single before three consecutive outs closed an eventful top of the first.
Texas A&M carried over their hot hitting from Thursday's game to the bottom of the first, putting two runners in scoring position to open the first before scoring a run off Harvard starter, junior Jay Driver. The Crimson left the first with a 2-1 lead.
The third provided little offensive action for either front. Harvard first-year infielder and pitcher Gio Colosante reached base on a walk with two down before the Crimson took the field.  Driver began a spotless five-inning stretch from the second to sixth by retiring Aggie batters in 1-2-3 fashion in the bottom of the second.
Harvard immediately mirrored Texas A&M’s quick exit at the plate in the top of the third, compiling three straight outs and sending Driver right back out to the mound, where he continued to dominate the Texas university, closing the third at 2-1.
Harvard’s hitters broke the lull in scoring in the top of the fifth. With one down, Messevery ripped a double to left center to give the Crimson a runner in scoring position, and after a flyout by Rounds, Bravo drove Messervy into home off an error committed by Texas A&M, extending the Crimson lead to 3-1.
Driver continued his dominant start in the bottom of the fifth and sixth innings. As Crimson hitters went silent in the sixth, Driver allowed no breathing room for Texas A&M, compiling two shutout innings to close the day with 6.0 IP, 1ER and 6SO, exiting the game in position for the win.
“He’s a quality arm that we have and probably one of the better ones in New England.” Decker said. “His performance on Friday was really good.”
Driver’s pitching was deeply missed as the game progressed. After another silent inning Harvard at the plate, the Crimson handed the ball to Senior Tim Williamson to replace Driver at the mound. After getting a ground out from his first batter of the inning, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi hit hard against Williamson, scoring a run and placing a runner on third off a couplet of hits and a wild pitch. A Texas A&M single brought in the runner from third, tying the game at 3-3 before Williamson loaded the bases and exited the game with 0.1 IP and 3 ER. Senior Harrison Stover replaced Williamson to close out the seventh, minimizing the potential damage by only allowing one unearned run on a wild pitch and retiring three Texas A&M-Corpus Christi hitters quickly to end the inning with Harvard falling behind for the first time in the game at 3-4.
The eighth inning kept the same excitement going. Following a strikeout by Bravo, Rounds hit a double to center and advanced to third on a wild pitch by the Aggies. Sophomore Sawyer Feller joined Bravo on the basepath with a walk, giving the Crimson runners on the corners with only one out in the inning before Feller stole second to put two runners in scoring position. Unfortunately, a pop-up and strikeout by Harvard closed any opportunity to capitalize on this scoring chance.
Stovern stayed in to shut out Texas A&M-Corpus Christi hitters in the eighth before sending the Crimson up to the plate for a final chance to save the game in the ninth.
For a moment, it seemed as if the Crimson did just that —  with Colasante reaching first on an error, Harvard drove in an unearned run through singles by Berger and Rounds, tying the game at 4-4.
In heartbreaking fashion, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the ninth on a fielder's choice.
Game 3: Harvard 7, TAMCC 3
Bouncing back quickly for the second game of the day, the Crimson stayed hungry to avenge its loss only hours before, doing just that, and maintaining steady control.
Harvard continued its opening-inning hot streak, scoring two runs in the first inning for the third time in the series. Quickly down two outs after ground outs from Messervy and Rounds, Bravo continued to contribute extra-base hits, slicing a double to right field. Coming off a pitch-hit appearance in the start of the doubleheader, Berger launched a home run to left field, putting the Crimson up 2-0 before the inning closed on another ground out.
Junior Chris Clark took the ball to start game three of the series, following up Driver’s strong performance with one of his own. Clark retired his first six batters of the day, keeping the score at a 2-0 Harvard lead entering the third, where the Crimson broke the game open and never looked back.
Harvard quickly put runners on the basepath to begin the inning, with Messervy reaching first on a wild pitch on an error, and advancing to second and third through a fielder's choice and a single by Bravo, setting up runners on the corners for the Crimson. Capitalizing on the moment, Feller homered to left field to break the game open at 5-0 before Harvard took the field in the bottom of the inning.
The Crimson responded in the fourth and fifth by scoring a run in each inning, pushing the lead back up to five at a score of 7-2. Messervy doubled in the fourth and was brought in by a Logan Bravo single, while Colasante brought Berger in off third base on a fielder's choice in the fifth. Clark stacked strong innings on top of his strong early start, shutting out Texas A&M-Corpus Christi from the fourth through fifth innings and letting up an unearned run, ending his day with 6 IP and 2 ER.
Both offenses stayed quiet in the seventh, with the game ending at 7-3 Harvard.
Game 4: Harvard 3, TAMCC 5
In their final game of the series, Harvard played another competitive game, losing contention for victory in the final innings.
For the fourth consecutive game, the Crimson marked the scoreboard in the first inning, powered by a Peter Messervy double to open the game, which extended his extra base hit streak to three games. Rounds advanced Messervy to third on a ground out to first, and Bravo’s sacrifice fly to center field brought in the first Harvard run of the game.
On the mound, senior Sean Matson began the day for the Crimson pitching staff efficiently, getting out of the inning with only ten pitches thrown and three batters faced.
Matson maintained pace through the next three innings of his start, shutting out Texas A&M through the fourth inning and compiling 3 SO and 2 BB in the process.
With the exception of a pair of singles by Baldwin and another by Feller, the Harvard bats stayed relatively quiet through this stretch, with the score sitting at 1-0 until the top of the bottom of the fifth, where the Aggies scored a run off Matson to tie the game at 1-1.
At the top of the seventh, the Crimson stepped up to the plate and tied the game at 2-2. After a single by senior catcher and third baseman Zach Brown, a walk by Snopek, and a Colasante single to put runners on the corners, a sacrifice fly by Baldwin tied the game before the inning ended on a fly out by Messervy.
Relieving Matson for the day, senior infielder and pitcher Will Jacobsen took the ball for the Crimson, putting away Texas A&M in the bottom of the seventh with no additional runs added to the board.
The Crimson quickly entered and exited the top of the eighth with three fly-outs, putting Texas A&M back at the plate.
Things began to unwind for the Crimson in the bottom of the eighth inning.  Resulting from a mix of singles, a stolen base and back-to-back errors in the field, the Aggies took a 5-2 lead on Harvard entering the ninth.
In its last chance to salvage the victory, the Crimson came up just short. With one down, a double by Snopek gave Harvard a runner in scoring position, and a flyout by Colasante advanced Snopek to third base. Down to their final out, Snopek scored on a wild fourth ball in an at-bat by Baldwin, cutting the Texan lead to two. Messervy walked in the next at-bat, and another wild pitch to Rounds advanced both Messervy and Baldwin to second and third. With the game-tying runners in scoring position, Rounds made contact, but grounded out to second, ending the game and the series in favor of Texas A&M.
“I thought Matson was really good,” Decker started. “But we made some miscues and we got to tighten up some things but anyways it's part of the experience of the road run. We just gotta prepare for this week starting tomorrow and just get ready to have our Ivy League opening series against Penn”.

I know that I can’t speak for everyone else, but honestly, I’m going to do it anyway. Spring break was definitely needed, and man, it felt great to finally be home. But, as nice as no responsibilities for a week felt, I did find myself missing parts of campus life. When our day-to-day schedules are clogged by midterms, late-running labs, and last-minute psets, it can be hard to take a step back and smell the roses. But, when you do, it’s clear that there are a lot of things to love about this place. Here are a few of the things that I missed about Harvard during our weeklong hiatus.
The Wednesday $1 Drinks at the Capital One Peet’s
There is nothing better, in my humble opinion, than getting a cute little treat to bolster your motivation for studying. Just kidding, there is something better: when this doesn’t break the bank! Even though I might stand in that god-forsaken line for more than an hour, the Wednesday after 3 p.m. Capital One Cafe $1 drink is exactly what I need in the middle of every week to lift my spirits. It is criminal that I missed one of these Wednesdays while I was at home.
My suitemates <3 
I absolutely ADORE my roommates. They’re genuinely the sweetest people to walk the surface of this Earth. Not having them in my company for a week (with the exception of the one I brought home with me) was definitely lonely. It wasn’t even the fact that they weren’t there to talk to, we definitely texted over break. It’s just the little moments, like walking back into the dorm at 3 a.m. disheveled after a night in Lamont— thinking that you’re so deep in the trenches, beyond the point of saving, only to find your lovely suitemate sitting at their desk in the dim lamplight also suffering. An even better scenario is if they’re making the late night trek back to the dorm with me. It’s always so comforting to know that I am not alone in my struggles, and I definitely missed this special bonding over break.
Late night food runs
Speaking of Lamont and silly little treats, the best type of late night treat is not coffee (or shouldn’t be, at least) but instead food. I don’t think that there is anything that brightens my mood more than when I am in the Lamont basement and the friends I am studying with suggest a food run. Yes, I will gladly leave my backpack in the library at 1 a.m. to take a quick walk down the street for a burrito. No, I’m not that hungry. But the journey to the Jefe’s register when we are all hysterical makes it worth the $10 and change. And even better, on the weekends, food after the function never fails to hit the right spot. There aren’t a lot of places that have the same aesthetic at home. It’s just not the same.
That One Class 
I definitely have a favorite class this semester. Let me just say that the TF and people you’re with can make all the difference when it comes to dreading or loving your first class of the morning. I have never been so awake during a math class in my life, but the people that I am surrounded by constantly have me holding my stomach laughing, tearing up while trying to understand who Green is and why his theorem is important. Yes, I was happy to not have to bear the horror that was the MQC last week, but deep, deep (very deep) down inside, I missed it.
The River
Since the weather has been nicer, I have finally been able to appreciate the beauty of the Charles river without wearing the heaviest jacket that I own. It is such a wonderful feeling to put everything down for even a half hour and just take a walk with a few friends, talk about life, catch up. Definitely fuels the Cambridge and Boston aesthetic, and was something that I was missing back home in Connecticut.
My twin XL 
I genuinely believe that I have never slept better at any point in my life than I have during college. It could be the late nights, but more than likely it’s the mattress topper that I got on sale from Bed, Bath, and Beyond last summer. Sleep in my twin XL always hits the spot. This is not to shade my bed at home but here, my bed is especially comfortable exactly when I need it to be. I know my twin XL is here for me in the darkest times, and I missed that loyalty away on break.
The colors in my GCal (like yes I was stressed but at the same time at least it looked pretty)
I religiously use my GCal, and last week it was sad to see her so blank. Even though it was break and the time to relax, I kind of missed having all the pretty colors staring back at me while I would switch between tabs during lecture to see what was in store for the upcoming week. Sure, it’s stressful, but it’s also a good aesthetic.
The library social life
Even though the social life at Harvard parties might not be comparable to what other colleges have going on, the social life at Harvard libraries never seems to fail. Cabot Library, I’m looking at you. You could walk into that building at any time of day, especially night time, and find at least 10 people you know: that person from your FOP group that you haven’t seen in a while, that one CA from last semester — you name it, they’re probably there. Sometimes you just need that type of social interaction, and I missed having this hotspot to lean on.
Sidechat/Dean Khurana’s Instagram
There is only so much that can be posted on Sidechat while we are all at home, and nothing compares to the pictures and jokes sent in while we are all on campus. I missed seeing the daily HUDS content, or the overheard quotes from lectures. And the same goes for Dean K’s Instagram. How am I supposed to be featured if I’m catching up on sleep at home? I was definitely excited to come back for this one.
Remy <3
This is a given. Who doesn’t like cats? Who doesn’t absolutely adore Remy? This rush of happiness that I get when I unexpectedly see this little cat roaming around campus is the transformative experience that I think Harvard promised me all those months ago. I love my dog at home, don't get me wrong, but Remy was definitely lovely to come back to.
Even though this is only a list of 10 things, I think that I could go on and on. As awful as Harvard seems sometimes, there are definitely things we love and look forward to on campus. Savor it while you can; eight semesters isn’t that long!
